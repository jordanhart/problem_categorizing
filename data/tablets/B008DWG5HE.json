{"Reviews": [{"Title": "THE Tablet for Students, but Great for All", "Author": "B. Price", "ReviewID": "R64CIHTVR0QD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Review updated 2/5/2013.  I ordered this tablet immediately when Amazon posted it with 1-day shipping and as of 7/20/2013 I haven't had any issues as a few users seem to have reported.  Don't get discouraged if you get a lemon; just return it for another - Amazon has free returns/replacements in such cases. * Hand Written Notes - S Notes - Exports to PDF and also JPG.  It has templates for various types of productivity.  My favorites are the ruled paper, the meeting template (date, time, attendees, meeting notes) and the recipe template (I can imagine this being very useful for the kitchen, propped up in a case). - Papyrus Beta - This free application is very nice and similar to S Note but has normal paper templates such as College Ruled, Wide Ruled, Narrow Ruled, Blank and 4 different Graph Paper types. - ezPDF - Costs $3 and is what you'll probably want to make annotations on lecture slides and whatnot. - MOST applications allow you to rest your palm on the tablet while writing, others are not as well written.  This all depends on the author of a specific app. - SOME applications have nice erasers.  Some times you can press the button on the S Pen to erase instead of write and some times you can just use your finger to erase while using the S Pen to write.  This all depends on the author of a specific application. * Hand Writing Instead of Typing - The default keyboard has an option that lets you hand write in any input field instead of typing.  Long-press the settings (gear) button on the keyboard to select the T button which enables hand writing.  Please see the User Images of this product for a good example of this. * Multitasking (updated 2/5/2013) - Within the past week I've noticed a number of apps I use get multi-screen support so it's much less limited and a gimmick, now.  I can easily be taking notes on one half of the screen while browsing or chatting or whatever on the other half.  With more apps supporting the feature now it's a much larger factor in whether or not to buy. * GPS - Fast and accurate.  I am currently on the first floor of a two-story apartment building about ten feet away from the outer wall (sliding glass door) and Google Maps had my position within 40 meters almost instantly after turning on the GPS receiver.  Within 35ish seconds it had my position accurate to 10 meters. * S Pen - Comfortable to hold (I'm a 5'10\" tall guy and have normal sized hands).  There's an odd button on the side which adds extra functionality with certain gestures.  I have no idea how it works because I'm pretty sure the S Pen isn't powered in any way, but it's more than just a stylus. * Screen - Very sensitive.  I've been taking notes for half of my classes on my tablet and it works well.  I usually have the brightness set to 10-15% or slightly less in classrooms or at home because that's all I really need but also to conserve battery life. * Battery - While leaving it on all the time, wifi off when not using it, I manage to only charge my Note 10.1 once a week.  Standard usage includes notes during seven hours of lecture each week and using it periodically throughout the day or in the evening. - To really stretch your battery life you'll need to disable some apps.  I disabled Google+ and some of the default/Samsung apps that come with the device in Settings->Application Manager.  As of 2/5/2013 I'm still getting ~7 days out of one charge with moderate usage. * Build Quality - Standard Samsung quality.  The case has a lot of plastic and the back gives a little if you push on it but it definitely feels solid.  Now that it's in a case the build quality doesn't matter any more. * Speed - Very smooth.  I updated about 10 apps at the same time in the market, an operation which would nearly cripple my Galaxy S until it was done, and I couldn't tell any difference in the smoothness of the Note 10.1.  While I was exploring I ended up having 15-20 applications open at the same time but again I couldn't tell any difference. - Coming from a Galaxy S phone and hardly ever using a tablet before, I'm amazed by how fast this thing boots/restarts. * Wifi - No complaints.  It connects quickly and hasn't had any issues. * Sound - Good, loud and scared my cat when I started something on Google Play.  She looked around like she does when our surround sound is on because she doesn't understand what was making such a noise.  I can't tell any difference in quality between it and my laptop when watching the same video on both (the laptop was ~$1700 before a coupon). * Rooting Friendly - Check out the forum for this tablet on xda developers for info.  This device already has developers that say they'll work on it and I'm sure more will sign up because the Note 10.1 stands out among the crowd. * Universal Remote / IR Blaster - Works well enough.  I'm going to sell my Logitech Harmony One universal remote because the Peel application works but could be nicer.  With my Harmony One I could set up custom activities like Listen to Radio on my Onkyo receiver but the Peel application only has standard actions like Watch Bluray.  I can still set it to play the radio but it's buried in the menus. - Great cable TV interface.  We don't watch/have cable, but if you tell it what service you have it'll tell you what is currently playing, what will be playing and provides customized content based on the preferences you specify.  It works with DVRs so I imagine you can manage all of that from the Peel application as well. * Cameras - Amazon removed the images I posted for some reason so just take my word that the cameras work well.  Both the front 1.9MP camera and 5MP camera fully live up to their specs. * The Wife - Now that I've set it up the way I like it she won't put it down.  You may not want your not-so-techie spouse to love it, but at least my wife won't be complaining that I spent $550 on it and then another nearly $100 on accessories =) * SwitchMe App - When set up properly, if your tablet is rooted, this free application will give your Android device multiple profiles.  Normally an Android device can only have one primary Google account to use with Google specific applications and whatnot, but this allows you to have separate profiles with separate accounts and separate applications.Note:  If you're going to use the SwitchMe app, DO NOT clone one profile to create another.  Just set up a completely new profile.", "Date": "August 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Really like it", "Author": "Alex Alexzander", "ReviewID": "R1S7WZM8L3L8Q1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I didn't buy mine from Amazon as I couldn't find it on Amazon. I ended up going to my local BestBuy to pick it up. The reviews online were mostly okay except for The Verge which said it was sluggish and basically was down beat on it.I decided to buy it and if I didn't like it I would be returning it. I picked it up around 5:30PM on the 16th of August which is the release date. The first thing I did was get rid of all the widgets that are on the home screens. I suspect those might slow it down. I kept only one widget which is the clock / weather widget. I then downloaded all my favorite apps and began to arrange and configure it the way I wanted it.It comes with Polaris Office, which is better than QuickOffice if you plan to create and edit word docs, Polaris is easier. To view documents and complex excel sheets I find QuickOffice often does the better job. I ed up keep both installed just in case.I installed 14 games on it. All of which perform very well. There are my favorites, like FieldRunners, and newer ones like Final Fantasy, Ski Safari, Nova 3, Osmos HD, Amazing Alex and Zynga poker that I also really like. This quad core eats through anything with ease.Got the latest Google Maps, which is so fantastic on this. You can save a Map so it's available without a data connection. Perfect for these WiFi devices. I'm a fan of the new Google Play movies, music, books and Magazines too. But if you prefer Amazon or Nook, those are available as always. It comes with the B&N; Nook Reader by default.There are Galaxy Note 10.1 specific apps like Adobe's PS Touch. I've been using Photoshop since 1996 so I am going to carefully review the built in lessons for PS Touch, a mobile version of Photoshop and see how far I can take that. If you are a subscriber to Adobe's Cloud services you're supposed to be able to edit a PSD with PS Touch, save it to the cloud, and then continue to edit it with Photoshop the desktop app.There is also S Note. S Note and PS Touch are geared to work well with the new Samsung Galaxy S Pen. This was a primary reason for me to be interested in this particular tablet. The S Pen is so accurate that you can hand write whole sheets of handwritten text with it. I didn't try to have it translated into actual text like type written text. I just left it as my handwriting. Really like it.Now this new Note 10.1 also has a new Muli-tasking feature. I should say that it doesn't multitask any app combo you want. Just a few apps blessed by Samsung which are: The base browser, not Chrome, their video player, Polaris Office, the picture gallery and their email app, not the GMail email app. Their email app can be used with POP, IMAP and Microsoft's Exchange via the built in Active Sync. So I tend to use that email client for work email and I use GMail as my personal email client.Now, according to The Verge, multitasking was horrible. Not so fast Verge. I don't know what you guys are doing but I multitask'd just about every way you can on this and it works surprising well. I wrote notes while playing video. I played video while scrolling up and down on a web page. I copied text from an email to S Note, which both apps loaded in the side by side both on the screen simultaneously method. I had no trouble at all.I bought Autodesk's Sketchpad Pro and can draw with that just fine. I also bought Adobe Ideas, but haven't yet played with that at all. Samsung also has their own kind of store and I am going to see if they have more S Pen specific apps. Really like the S Pen a lot. It's exactly like a typical Wacom Stylus. It's sharp, not that horrible eraser head large stylus you get stuck with if you want to use a stylus on the iPad. Although the iPad has Paper by 53, which I wish I had on here.I'm really just getting started. I'll have to update this review over the weekend. Only played with this new tab for about 4 to 6 hours now.Check out Google's Currents for news, and Pocket for saving articles for future reading. Both are great on this tablet. I think all the bases are covered with this tablet. Movies, games, magazines, office and productivity, art creation and editing. It does everything. And since it is Android, you have a real file system which makes email a breeze. Love this thing so far.", "Date": "August 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "It's Samsung time now", "Author": "Jini Jazz", "ReviewID": "R20VE2KIIS83RU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a long time Apple guy who currently owns 2012 Retina Macbook Pro, 27 inch iMac, iPad3, & iPhone 4S. I stay with Apple products mainly because Mac does the best for what I do. However, I never have been 100% satisfied with iPhone & iPad due to their unnecessary restrictions and limitations. I just couldn't find alternatives - I love Android in terms of features and potential, but the execution(overall user experience) has been lagging.I guess that the time has come. Galaxy Note 10.1 made big step forward and turned the potential into reality. Just after 48 hours learning and playing around, I am convinced this is the device I want to use everyday. It is the first tablet that actually helps my productivity, no more frustration with restricted toy. So iPad goes to my mom now.I won't relist pros and cons, since all reviewers already listed them. But I just want to correct a few misconceptions that some biased online reviewers manufactured.1. Some people lie about build quality and they claim it makes squeaky sound when they grap it. Either they got the defect or it is downright lie. It feels solid and much better material for everyday use. Aluminum on my iPad may \"look\" better, but not practical without cover or case. I always had to use cover for my iPad to prevent scratches. But if you have to use case to cover, what's the point? It covers \"beautiful\" aluminum anyway. I don't even use cover/case for Galaxy Note and it feels just right in many hours use. Again, this two tone design(mine is white-silver) looks beautiful, very comfortable for many hours. This tablet is designed to work, not just look.2. Screen - screen resolution is one of the reasons I was hesitant to try Galaxy Note. All I can say is just go try it yourself. This screen is beautiful! Yes you heard this from the owner who use Retina Macbbok Pro and 27 iMac everyday. Do not fall into john doe's resolution comparison, just go check it yourself! Sure 1920 would be nice, but I'd take  Galaxy's 1280 with S-Pen any day.3. Some say it's expensive. Do you know how much it cost to buy wacom device with this size and feature alone?Most importantly, this tablet is so fast and responsive and delivers many things in my wish list \"today\". No more compromising and stuck with iPad. S-Pen, true multitasking (yes limited as of now, but it's already very powerful and useful), and microSD support (I feel like a prisoner who just escaped from Alcatraz!).  I suggest you to check this device yourself and never fall into some online reviews.Don't get me wrong. I still love Apple products and I will stay with Mac unless I see something better for my life and work. I just wanted to share my experience with Galaxy Note 10.1 because there are so many false reviews from Apple or Android fan boys and girls.*** I strongly recommend you to watch all SAMSUNGmobile's YouTube videos to utilize Galaxy to its full potential. You will see why I think no other tablets can even compete with Galaxy Note. ***One more thing...I know my next phone will be Samsung Galaxy Note II.", "Date": "September 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "In MY opinion, not worth the price over the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 Tablet", "Author": "Arthur K. Yellin \"dinosaurus13\"", "ReviewID": "R2O1SZ3MIKIGXW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Below is a review of several tablets I tried in MY chronological sequence with them, with explanations of why I rejected all but the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet. I am placing the same review under each model I tried.Background - I am now 65 - NOT a member of the electronic generation! I love playing Scrabble and thought intensive games in general. I know very little about smart phones or tablets.  I firmly believe that a company OWES SUPPORT to their consumers and NOT at additional cost! Customer service is VERY important to me! Before anyone accuses me of bias: I have NO connection to ANY of the companies mentioned. I am simply a consumer relating my personal experiences!iPad - first generation - EVERYTHING you do with it is tied to iTunes.  When I tried it, there was absolutely NO manual or documentation available for iTunes.  Beyond the first 90 days Apple wants to charge for tech support.  I found iTunes and the Apple OS to be confusing and difficult to use.  The tablet, itself, performed well but I prefer an OS that allows direct folder and file access.Samsung Galaxy 7 inch tablet first generation. This device runs Android 2.3. It is now several years old and STILL functions perfectly. The battery still holds an all day charge with moderate usage. I have never found an app that is \"incompatible\" with this model. This is an important point in the reviews that follow. I even used it to shoot surprisingly excellent videos of a music/dance presentation in a dimly lit auditorium.  Now, several years later, with cataracts growing in both eyes as well as \"floaters\" in both eyes, I was seeking a screen larger than the 7 inch.Motorola Xoom 10.1 tablet. It is HEAVY. While it worked well, for reasons unknown to me it was not compatible with several of my favorite apps. Furthermore, the screen seems to get greasy very quickly!Asus TF300 Transformer 10.1 inch tablet.  While the construction of mine was solid, all the other negative observations of other reviewers were immediately apparent. The tablet would not maintain wi-fi contact even close to my router. The Asus TF300 was also incompatible with many of my favorite apps. Finally, the Asus TF300 (and TF700 mentioned below) has a strange auto-spelling correct system that FREQUENTLY screwed up my typing. To their credit, Asus did answer my question with instructions on how to turn the spelling correction off, but only via email. They have NO telephone tech support.Samsung Galaxy NOTE 10.1 inch tablet. While it offers a pull out writing stylus AND a rear facing autofocus camera, I saw little difference between it and the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 table discussed below.  At roughly $200 more than the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet, although it performed well, I did not feel it was worth the difference in price.Asus TF700 Transformer Infinity -  suffers many of the same problems as the less expensive TF300 model. SPASTIC OS, intermittent wi-fi disconnection. The auto-brightness control also appeared not to work or not to work properly. Perhaps worst of all, possibly because of the increased resolution (the improved resolution was NOT apparent to MY eyes - it appeared to me about the same as all the other tablets) the device is incompatible with MANY apps!(added 12/7/2012) Pursuant to a few comments, I AGAIN tried an Asus TF700 and compared it SIDE BY SIDE with my Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 inch tablet.  With the better processor, higher memory capacity and increased resolution, I GENUINELY hoped that the ASUS TF700 was worth the difference in price.  I was hoping that the first one I tried was an outlier.  SADLY, it was NOT.  For some unknown reason, the Asus TF700 is NOT compatible with Scrabble, a major reason for my tablet use (to keep in frequent touch with my daughter).  That, however, is minor and will probably be addressed in the future.  Again, side by side, the Samsung Galaxy 2 tablet reported a STRONG wi-fi signal, the Asus TF700 reported only a GOOD signal.  While downloading apps, the Google Play Store froze on the Asus, never on the Samsung.  I opened several apps, one at a time, simultaneously on BOTH tablets and examined them under exactly the same lighting and circumstances.  I WAS better able to read very fine print on the Asus (probably 4 point type, white against a dark background), otherwise, for all other apps, I saw NO significant difference between the two.  My opinion remains unchanged, SAVE your money and buy the Samsung Galaxy 2 tablet unless you will use the stylus and autofocus rear camera of the Samsung Galaxy NOTE.  I believe that Asus must work out a lot of bugs in their infinity before it is worthwhile!Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet.  It performed as well as my first generation Samsung Galaxy 7 inch tablet until I tried to download the QuickMark app to scan bar and QR codes. According to the app developer, the app is incompatible with the tablet because the tablet does NOT have an \"autofocus\" rear facing camera.  A phone call to Samsung tech support, and YES - Samsung BELIEVES in customer support at no extra charge, confirmed the absence of autofocus in the rear facing camera!  Since  I do NOT carry the tablet with me when I go shopping and am NOT likely to scan Bar or QR codes often, I felt I could live without the autofocus rear camera.  However, I did find a different QR code app that DOES work on the tablet.  I have now had the tablet for a week and am loving it. SO FAR, I have not found any incompatible apps other than QuickMark. I find the screen to be bright and sharp (auto brightness works well), and the contrast to be superb. I have used it to watch Big Bang Theory via the TBS app. The Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 inch tablet maintains strong wi-fi connection both anywhere in my home and at the school where I attend classes. Other than the lack of autofocus in the rear camera and the lack of direct USB connectivity without their proprietary cable (sadly, this lack of standardization is still common amongst tablet manufacturers), I have absolutely no complaints at this time.IF you do not need or can live without a rear camera that autofocuses (it DOES have a rear camera and a front camera for SKYPE and other functions), I highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet. At the current price of $300 for the wi-fi 16GB model (memory is expandable through a micro SD card. I see no need for a 32GB model), it is VERY reasonable! I think there are also cell phone service compatible models at additional cost.Advice to tablet shoppers:1 - Buy from a source that allows easy returns without restocking fees. Amazon is EXCELLENT for their customer service, but you may want to buy from a local store to avoid shipping time and costs. Buy from a source that does NOT charge a restocking fee AND allows a reasonable time for device trial.2 - Download as many apps that are free and that look appealing to you. Try each one at least briefly.  NOTE any apps that are not compatible with the tablet you are testing. How important are they to you?3 - Look at each screen under bright and dim lighting. How do YOU find the brightness (usually adjustable, if auto-brightness does not work well for you), the contrast, the sharpness?4 - Log into your email account and/or create a Gmail account. Type an email to someone. Does the auto spelling correct work well for you? Is the virtual keyboard suited to your style and needs?5 - Play with the tablet for a whole day, if you can afford the luxury of sitting with it on. See how long the battery lasts.", "Date": "November 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "My Note 10.1 Compendium", "Author": "Leonaitis", "ReviewID": "R2IQ2G580J1RI9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Brief intro:Here goes nothing. I took a while to publish this review because I wanted to try and experiment with my Note and to address all the pros and cons of the device that others have posted about. It would have been unfair if I had posted a glowing 5 star review after only owning it for one day. Likewise, it would not have been beneficial to anyone if I had just blasted the device without spending any time using it. I went ahead and tried to learn as much as I could about the Note once I got it. I tried every app, every function, every setting and accessory I could get my hands on. I tried to make notes of what others have said that they did not like about it. I wanted to see for myself if the problems they pointed out applied to me. I won't go into details about specs, or compare my Note to other devices. Sufficed to say, more than enough other people have posted such reviews. All I can say is that I have tried other tablets such as the iPad and even the Nexus 10 and I do not regret my purchase of my Note 10.1.Before you read any further, you should be aware of the learning curves of tablets in general and the Note 10.1 in particular.Learning Curves:Beginner - If you have never used a tablet device you will have a learning curve. You will need to learn how to maximize and minimize apps. You will need how to install apps and visit the app store. You will also have to realize that just because an app is bad, that does not mean the Note itself is at fault. Not every app maker takes the time to customize their products for every device and you need to be aware going in to this purchase that many apps are not maximized to work and be viewed perfectly on a tablet device. If you can handle the beginner learning curve, and teach yourself how to view Netflix and listen to music and play Angry Birds and you feel like your brain will explode from all the new things you had to learn, then you probably don't need a Note. If you don't want to do anything else beside these basic functions I would suggest you save some money and buy a Kindle Fire or a less expensive device. They will be more than powerful enough for what you need them to do. Don't get a Note and then complain it is over priced simply because you do not use it to its full potential.Advanced - If you learned all the basics about the Note, or have mastered these type of devices and are hungry for more, then get a Note. Keep in mind you will then have to spend more of your own precious free time to learn all the extra things this device can do. It will not magically do everything for you. Just because you get a Note does not mean you will magically be able to edit pictures in Photoshop or master handwriting tools and use the stylus by simply turning the device on. There is a steep learning curve and the manuals/tutorials included from Samsung are terribly bare. You will be left to your own to discover resources that help you take full advantage of your new device. Luckily for you, you can find tons of these resources out on the web!Here are a few of the pros and cons folks have posted about and what I found out.Pros (and some small concerns):-Auto rotate for most programs , Netflix, Internet, Facebook. Most apps will auto rotate for you. Great for when you want to view some websites or larger files in portrait mode. I noticed that some of the older apps do not auto rotate. Since I started using this a few have updated themselves and fixed the problem, but it varies by the app maker. I also noticed that a few of the newer apps that should rotate, did not. I then realized this happens mostly for apps that use the front facing camera. I guess it make sense for these apps to not allow you to use the Note upside down, otherwise your camera output to apps such as Skype would result in your face showing upside down to the person you would be chatting with at the time. For the most part this only caused one minor annoyance since I have been using the Note. Mainly, when I try and charge the Note while using it, the charging cable fits into the bottom of the device. I can't then go ahead and place the device on my lap because I will pinch the charging cable. So I just have to make sure not to charge the device while I am using a few camera specific apps. Not really a big bother though.- Store maps for offline use! Great app feature, specially since you don't have to find WiFi signal or use your phone's hotspot to update the map on long trips.- Streams from my home media server and allows me to access all my movies and music from anywhere in the house. Even the backyard.- WiFi works fine. I have no problems logging into both 2.4 and 5 networks. Even at the slower speed I am able to stream videos from my media server and apps such as Netflix with no lag whatsoever. I also connect to multiple WiFi networks at work and other locations and never have an issue trying to connect.- Cameras are not the best you will see out there but both work nice. Both front and back have decent image quality and so far the video taken on the rear facing camera looks great. I know folks always want the greatest and latest but the cameras are more than ample enough for everyday use. The stock app is ok but I prefer to use one I got from the app store. More about this later.- TV remote works great. I am able to control not only my home TV and cable but also my folks TV and their satellite service from my tablet. Needless to say it took them a few visits until they realized I was the one messing with their channels and they were indeed not going crazy!- HDMI output works great but no subtitles! The HDMI out adapter is a bit confusing. You actually have to plug your wall charger into it then then to the TV and once that is done it works great! I am able to save some of my movie files on my Note for offline viewing on long trips and can then output the movie to an HDMI input on any TV. Works great. There is one drawback though and this seems to be universal across most tablet makers. If you are viewing a website and decide to export it to the TV for better viewing, the Note will not export any subtitles. You can see them just fine on the Note, but not on the TV. I have asked Samsung about this but not have had a definite reply yet. It should not matter if you don't use subtitles though.- Overall performace is great. I can open multiple apps, multi task items and even have a pop up video playing at the same time and have no performance issues. I did test out one of these Notes at an electronics retailer that had the old Android OS and it was not as fast as the one I got. The latest upgrade really helped performance. I have no complaints in this department.Cons:-Not all programs can be multitasked. Samsung is bringing out new software patch for phones that will allow multi task on all apps for their newer phones, maybe it will trickle down to the Note. However, I like the real estate on my Note. I am not sure how many items I would like opened at once.-If charging while using an app that doesn't auto rotate, charging cable sticks out the bottom. Very inconvenient location.Apps:Here are some the of the apps I use. Most are free, some are not.- S Note exports to jpg and PDF file formats. However, the handwriting takes time to learn. I was having a rough time of it at first but then messed around with the stylus settings and sensitivity and can whip out notes of all kinds with no troubles. I also adore the S Note feature that ignores your hand if it accidentally touches the tablet surface when using the S pen. Otherwise, I would have smudges on every document I have writen so far. There is a small learning curve for this app. Do not despair.- PS Touch is awesome! Takes a larger than normal learning curve though. I found 2 great channels on Youtube where the users teach you various functions of this app step by step. It is great to sit in front of the TV and watch someone use the features of this app in real life while you practice on your Note and master them. If you use Photoshop on your PC then you will be glad to know the menus and options for this app are very similar to the PC versions so you are already ahead of the game. It is not a full blown version but pretty good nonetheless.- Dropbox is great for multiple devices. I have my phone, computers and Note linked to the same account. I like being able to take pictures on my phone and then being able to pull them up and edit them on my tablet. Once done I can toss them back and have access to them from any of my devices or PC's. Also great for moving files back and forth without having to plug my Note into my PC.- Amazon has two apps. One for their store and one for their apps. The regular Amazon app tracks your Amazon purchases and tracks packages, pretty neat if you use Amazon a lot. However,the Amazon App store offers free apps everyday. I have snagged several apps from this site for free and saved a few bucks from having to get them off the Google Play store. It uses your Amazon credentials so I like the fact that you don't have to enter additional financial info in order to pay for items from the Google Play Store. Also, every app I have looked at seems to be 40-50% cheaper on the Amazon app site than on Play Store. I have this app and log into it every day to see what goodies they are giving away. I don't like the fact it is not part of the main Amazon app but it is still great for getting free stuff!- Kindle book reader. Great for reading books, I love the settings and while I would not get a Note just for reading books, it is a great addition for an item I was already getting regardless.- Netflix works flawless. Also, if you have Netflix on an external device such as PS3, you can bring that up and log into Netflix on your Note and you can acutally use it as a remote and control your Netflix through your Note. Handy little trick that was added to android devices recently.- Pocket Cloud is used for VPN connections. I am not sure if most folks would use the VPN feature on the Note but I use it to connect to my work on the weekends sometimes. I then fire up Pocket Cloud and bam! I am logged into my workstation back at my work desk and can access and run everything just as if I was sitting at my desk.- SuperGNES. Yea, what can I say. A free SNES player that allows me to download free ROMS and play some Zelda to unwind once in a while. Purely for nostalgia purposes though.- Skype I use mainly to call overseas and to have my mom do video chatting with her grandkids up in Ohio. They love it and it works great. Even better since it is free.- Video Player that comes with it by default is pretty nice. Plays multiple video formats and is able to pick up my home media servers and stream from them.- Youtube is a great tool to use. I love to have it up and running and be able to control it from my couch. Yes, like the Netflix app, android users can log into youtube from your device and control playback as well as manage lists and favorites and other preferences. I love it because when you have to search for items it is way easier to type into the Note than trying to navigate through the bulky and not very user friendly text input of my media devices.- ezPDF Reader is better than just about every other PDF app I tested. Amazon has given this one away for free before on their APP store so keep an eye out. It lets you add notes and tons of other features to your PDF files. Works with the S Pen.- Camera Zoom FX is a step up from the built in camera app included with your Note. It has some handy camera features and filters that are not included natively on your Note and too much of a pain to apply to your pictures once they have been taken. This app does it while taking the shots. Great time saver.Notes: Some observations I have made.- Some apps dont work as well as the full website, it is best to just go to the full website instead. This is for android apps in general, not just on the Note.  However, some sites force you into a 'mobile view'. They look pretty horrible and are pretty useless. Make sure you force your Note browser into 'desktop view' and you will be able to view the full site and use all features on it just fine.- Battery charge. I used it regularly to access web, Skype, few apps and some note writing using the S pen as well as messing around with some videos and pictures. I could go about 3 days or so before I realized I needed to charge the unit. Overall not too bad for what I was making it do. I went ahead and tested it over a few weekends of heavy use to see how it handled the load. I opened videos, web, several apps I did not need and multi tasked to my hearts content. Using this heavy load I was able to run the battery down in about 8 hours. Your charges may vary, but I was overdoing it to test it for myself. As far as charging times go, it will charge about 15%+ per hour when not being used, 12% if used while charging. So yes, you can fully charge it while using it. Just be aware, you will NOT be able to charge this baby by simply plugging the charging cable into the USB port of your computer. You can transfer files but the power output from standard USB ports is not strong enough to power the Note. You will need a direct connection to a wall outlet.Accessories:- Screen protector and a tablet leather case are a must. You need to keep this baby safe. I tried many cases and screen protectors before I settled on mine. HDMI out works nice. Just make sure you plug it in properly. Car adapter can come in handy. However, I had a bit of misfortune on the first one I purchased. Aside from that it works well.  The charging cable that comes with the unit is very short and does not let you charge the unit while using it unless you sit next to the wall outlet. Get a larger one for charging and use the small one for Note to PC transfers.*** Special Note***SD cards! I was at the Samsung site yesterday and someone asked the maximum size of the SD cards that can be used with the Note 10.1. The Samsung rep answered \"32GB\". This is wrong. I am running a 64GB card and it works great. I have more than one and have the extra ones filled with movies for long boring trips. Since the latest Android update these cards are automatically found by your Note 10.1. Prior to this update you had to go through a painful process of formatting 32Gb and 64GB cards to get them to properly show up. I think that is why Samsung kept folks from trying out the 64GB cards. They work fine! Make sure you get the right ones though and be careful with the hassle free packaging ones offered by Amazon. Buy the retails ones instead.I have written reviews on the types of accessories I ended up purchasing. I did much research on all of them. One thing I suggest you do is to be careful about your vendor. I had no problems with any of my accessories except one. The rest work great and are Samsung brand items. If you are worried about getting some of the accessories here, go to the Samsung site and register your product. After a few days they will send you a complimentary loyalty coupon that gives you 50% any and every accessory for your Note. (At least they did for me) It is a one time deal though. This makes the prices much more compatible with Amazon and takes the worry out of getting the right item that will work. I have only had one small problem with an Amazon item and I have been shopping from this site for many years. I find Amazon to be very dependable. Please read the reviews (good and bad) on every item in order to make an informed decision.Response to other reviews:Here are some notes I added to address the concerns others had when they reviewed their Notes.-KIES - I am not sure what to make of this. Folks complain about this sayging it doesn't work, while others say it works fine. I use it on my S III, a few PC's and my Note and have no issues. I installed it because my Windows 7 PC would not properly identify my Note until KIES was installed. I have no issues.-Saumsung is slow to push updates. I have heard this complaint many times. I would have to say I agree with this comment. Samsung is one of the slowest companies when it comes to pushing updates. They could easily just push out the latest Android builds after a few tweaks but noooooooo, not Samsung. They take forever to push these out. However, once they do push them out they add so many extra features than just the stock Android builds! My last phone update took a bit to get here but it improved battery life immensely and added a few tweaks that made the phone even better. The last update for the Note improved performance all around, as well as battery life and many added new features for free. Also improved SD card compatibility. I can hardly wait for their next update which has even more features in store! Oh wait, I can wait, because I have no other choice. They are are slow...- It is hard to bring up apps from background? Tap the app button and the list comes up much like task manager. You can then bring up any previously opened app. It is located right next to the home button. What is so hard about that? Want to turn off apps? Open the App widget and tap away at what you want to turn off. I run my Note with tons of items running all over the place nad it doesn't affect battery life much. I am not sure why some folks are bothered by this but in my extensive testing I didnt find any unused open apps affected my battery life or charge times.- S Note has a small space to write in. You can't fit that much on a page? Some have said this, but it  scrolls down fine for me. I am able to use all the functions. It did take me a while to practice and get used to how it works though. It works fine for me now that I practiced. However, I had no idea what I was doing the first time. It is a learning curve and I think folks expect it to work like other programs they have tried before?- Folks have said their passwords are saved in the browser. Once I changed the settings it never saved them for me. So I was unable to replicate this issue.- The learning curve can be steep for some items. Hard to find tutorials or guides. I have to agree with this comment. Manuals and guides are virtually non-existent for the Note and the built in apps. However, with a little bit of searching you can find them online. The best so far have been the dozens of you tube channels on every app that I have looked for. It takes some effort to get started though. They will not be hand delivered to you.-Flash upgrade! Many folks complain about the lack of Flash on your Note. This was a decision made by Adobe. They are getting away from all Flash development for mobile devices. Flash was too buggy and caused performance issues so Adobe just decided to stop supporting it and move on to HTML5. It pains me to see how many people post and blast Samsung for this. It was not a Samsung decision. With that said, if you go to the Adobe site and look up the archived Adobe files section, you will be able to download and install Flash 4.x for your Note that works just fine with every website I have been to so far.I love my Note. I would not get one for my mom. It is more than she needs. I would get her a Kindle. It doesn't mean I don't love her.:)Make sure you do your research!If you have any questions about anything leave a comment and I will try to answer if I can.", "Date": "March 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "My 8th Tablet and My Favorite by Far", "Author": "Carol A. Anderson", "ReviewID": "R3N98LP74WTNLB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Update after 2 months:UPDATE after 4 months:Samsung is releasing whole new software suite, see comments for link,10 minute video of all the new stuff.I have mostly positive things to say. I actually found out that it will not only run split screens plus 5 apps like I mentioned but up to 11.The screen resolution is NOT an issue at all. Only with the poorest of feeds will the display show up as fuzzy. The speaker stereo separation is fantastic. I didn't really notice until I played an audio book and heard how noticeable the separation actually was. I added while docked, each of my 5 different portable speakers to the back of the dock and the tablet speakers sounded better.Cons: I noticed that when using the Chrome browser, that with too many tabs open, like over 12, the cut and paste quite working and the browser froze. This forced a total reset. I finally exchanged the tablet. Same problem again. So I gave up using the Chrome browser, and not a problem one since then. So not the tablet per say, but it and chrome just don't play nice when used so heavily. With the included tablet browser, after too many open tabs, a warning notice comes up and instructs to close a tab before opening another. That's it. Love Love Love this tablet, a lot to learn but worth the price of admission imho.I have been addicted to tablets for a couple of years now. I have stayed away from Apple products for personal reasons. So Android at this time is the best bet for me. I tried a Windows tablet last year and they were not ready for my needs at that time. The ones that might, cost over $1200 or more. I spend at least 6 hours a day on a tablet. I have owned 8 Android Tablets and one Windows tablet. I still have 4 Androids.I started with a $149 K-Mart tablet and went all the way to the $600 Asus Infinity TF700T.Asus TF700T, I know the Asus TF700 is a great tablet. I bought the only one on Amazon that was defective.No choice but to return. I just have bad luck sometimes. But it turned out OK in the end. I was able to wait for this one.I have a Galaxy Note i717 5.3\" cell phone and I love it, they call it the \"phablet \"but really it is too small for a tablet and more a supersized phone. But I love the display and the S Pen. So after watching MobileTechReviews, You Tube, of Lisa showing all the features of this tablet and her doing a smack down, with this tablet and the Asus TF700 Infinity, I made the decision to buy this one.I am very happy I did.***Full Samsung video review, live links are not permitted in reviews. So to see them, click on add comments below.The first one shows the videos.Pros: 1) It shares speed honors for all Android tablet with the Asus TF700 they are too close to call. Each winning battles back and forth for sheer power and speed.2)It has split screen functions, meaning you can do two things side my side at the same time. Like read your email and do a web search on two separate screens yet on the same display screen. No other tablet can do that.3)It has a very strong WiFi modem, it pulls in signal my other tablets don't.Nice Nice Nice.4)It is one of the few tablets that pulls Wifi from both the 2.4 and the 5 bands. Exceptional.5) The touch screen is extremely sensitive and it takes only the slightest of touch to registeryour input. I think because of the S Pen's needs for sensitive touch of over 1,000 ranges. I mean this touchscreen is the best I have ever used or touched.It tracks you finger movement extremely tightly.No noticeably lag, it is like the item you are moving is stuck to your finger. Most if not all Android tablets have some lag. So good job Samsung on that.6) It has picture in picture video. You can run a movie on any screen and your can move the movie box around any where on your display surface. You can re-size it if it gets in the way. The display has settings like a TV or monitor, you adjust the color and tone.7) It has a feature called Smart Stay, which is basicly a little eye that watches your eye. If you fall asleep watching a video, it shuts off. In the morning it has your place saved in the video where it shut off at. Nice feature for me.8) It will handle up to a Micro 64GB SDXC storage card which writes up to 30mbps, really adding lots of extra storage since most tablets only support 32GB. Ipad and Nexus 7 don't support any on board.9) It has a decent front camera for video chat, and the a decent rear camera with a flash, tablets are not cameras but this one is above average.10) It has the S Pen, meaning your can write, draw and lots lots lots more.11) The software is unique to this tablet only, meaning you can do things on this tablet no other tablet can do. There are some others, older, that have some features similar but not close to this guy.12) It will convert your printing or hand writing into text. It plots and solves equations.13) It will convert your hand drawn circles and squares to proper ones, making your look good. It just has too many features to list with the S Pen.14) It comes with PhotoShop software and the only limit is your imagination.15) It has front facing speakers like all tablets should have.16) It comes in White and it is lite and attractive and with 2GBs of Ram and a 1.4 Samsung Quad Core, it is one of the fastest tablets on the market and only $499..Compare to the Excite 7.7 and it is easy to see the value.17) It will handle HDMI to a big screen and USB keyboards, mice, game controllers, external hard drives, I have have tried a 500GB external hard drive, and it should do even larger, just pickup the adapters. Not expensive at all.18) It has a real GPS. Works without WiFi. Blue Tooth and so much more...19) It has too many Pros to list, really, I only scratched the surface. Oh, it is also an IR remote control for you home TV system, even controls cable or Direct TV, it learns your favorite shows and suggests them to you. Too much, for sure...love it...Oh, and if you have other Samsung products, like a Galaxy S 3, it talks to them as well with All Share...neat...it also has a very deluxe battery monitor system that has 4 sections with lots of graphs and setting and over heat warnings to get extra months of battery life.I later watched a Samsung 10 minute and he showed multi-tasking up to 5 functions at once. Email and Polaris on the 2 split screens,then adding picture in picture video on top of those two adding the calculator and another pop up screen, over the 4 programs already opens. 5 open screens at once on and Android SupervTablet.VersusCons: 1) It gets a knock for only having a 1280x800 resolution display screen, but, really it has adjustments like a TV has and your can set picture settings. So no, it doesn't have Retina, but it does just fine without it. Since not many apps support those hi resolution displays anyway. It could not be priced at $499 if it had all it has, plus the over the top display. This one is just fine, and I am fussy. Speaking of fussy, since I do go back and forth with multiple tablets, the two things that keep this tablet from being 100% perfect for me are simple. The blacks are fine but could be deeper. The whites are fine but could be whiter. While using this tablet I don't notice this. When I switch back to another of my tablets, I am reminded of this fact.However,once I pick up this tablet, I forget all about it and just enjoy it for all it's features.2) This is not an iPad, so it takes some effort to get the most out of it, so expect a learning curve for the S Pen, but it can be used as a basic Android tablet if you want to GROW into it. If you are a person with no computer skills, it may be a bit much for you. Then again, you can just use what you understand. Emails, videos, Facebook, Web Browsing, and you can have a lot of fun playing with the pen3) Double edge sword, the good it will fully charge on a 5v source like a USB port or 5v power block, the bad is it takes up to 5 hours to charge. So best to charge at night. In contrast my Asus charges in 2 hour 15 minutes but on 5v and turned off, it will only charge 50% all night because it's wall charger is 12-15v.4) The biggest CON is it took so long to get here.....Signed Happy New Owner...Cheers", "Date": "August 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Initial Impressions", "Author": "DaveC2000 \"davec2000\"", "ReviewID": "R1MMH3VSUXV7N9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Some quick first impressions of the Note 10.1 - This tablet is what the Transformer Prime should have been. I really don't see a ton of value in the S-Pen YET, but hopefully this feature will evolve and become a key strength.General touch responsiveness - GOOD - scrolling home screens is much more responsive than the Galaxy Tab 2, very close to the responsiveness of the Transformer Prime.Web Surfing - VERY GOOD - Page loads are very fast, much faster than the Galaxy Tab 2, very similar to ipad2 speeds. Scrolling is fast.Screen - FAIRLY GOOD - Same screen as Galaxy Tab 2. Similar to ipad 2. Not as nice as the new higher resolution tablets.I/O Performance - GREAT - RL Benchmark of 21 seconds... blows the doors off of ASUS & Nexus 7.The Pen - UNDECIDED - For taking notes with OCR the S Note app does not seem like it will be able to keep up with a keyboard and Evernote. The app still seems a bit immature, hopefully will get better over time. Included S Pen does not have the eraser side seen in some online videos.Gaming - VERY GOOD - Frame rates are fantastic, touch and accelerometer responsiveness seem great. HUGE improvement over G Tab 2.Compass - Worked great. Seems very accurate.WiFi - Seems to have strong reception and fast throughput throughout the house.GPS - Strong reception, quickly got accuracy to 20 feet indoors.Sound Quality - VERY GOOD - The front speakers are really nice for a tablet. You should have not issues covering the speakers with your hands.Build Quality - GOOD - Nice fit and finish, no loose parts, no surprises. Still feels a bit plasticy, not as nice as ipad.Software - Everything seems to run without any hiccups, more polished and less buggy than what I've seen on Asus tablets.Let me know if there are any other aspects you'd like to get feedback on to help you make your decision on this tablet.", "Date": "August 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "The best tablet not because of S-pen nor multitask (compared to transformer infinity)", "Author": "HoushaSen", "ReviewID": "RKIOCBP4HWGMU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "============= Updates ================9/15/2012Final Decision - I ended up choosing Infinity.  Please see updated conclusion section. Also updated Battery section to Tie because I finally got transformer dock and had to change my mind of what I said before.9/3/2012Week 2 update1. S-pen - So I still don't use this feature, but just for fun I tried.  Quickly, this is the closest to paper as it can get.  See the updated section of \"handwriting\".2. Windows 8 Tablets - Since recent IFA Berlin showed several upcoming Windows 8 tablet, I have decided to give a quick comparison to them.3. Future Potential - During IFA Berlin, Samsung announced the Jellybean update on the Galaxy Note 10.1 is coming \"very soon (changed from this year).\" & showed many cool features of upcoming Galaxy Note 2 (handheld) device features, which most likely be included in the Galaxy Note 10.1 as well.  See Future potential section for detail.8/24/2012After one full week of use, here is quick update.1. Stability - The stability of this system is amazing.  I had only a single crush of stock browser, which at this point could even be my error of clicking pushing button by accident.  Even on the iPad 2, I still had at least 1 or 2 freeze/crush every other day or so.  So this is actually the most stable tablet/system I have ever used.2. Lack of HD Screen - After 1 week of use, I had hoped that I would forget about my experience with HD Screen on Transformer Infinity.  Unfortunately this isn't the case. Whenever I browse and open a web page, I simply have to zoom in to be able really read things, which again wasn't the case with HD screen.  So yes. it is really noticeable.At this point, I can say basically Galaxy Note 10.1 is pretty much superior to transformer infinity in every aspect except HD screen.  However, the screen is one of the major point so the choice still remains to be a bit hard.  But once experiencing the stability & speed of Galaxy Note 10.1, I don't think I can go back to infinity or any other android tablet that gives us freeze or crush every hour.============= Vs. Upcoming Windows 8 Tablets ============I was actually hoping with IFA, at least one of windows 8 tablet announced be my dream system i.e. customizability & flexibility of android, solid 8+ hours battery life, portability, stability, speed and full HD screen.In short, no system met this criteria.  The major systems are ASUS Vivo series and Samsung ativ series.  Among these, only Samsung Ativ Smart Pro is the only one has full HD screen that Galaxy Note 10.1 lacks. However, this system like other full Windows 8 edition tablets are much heavier, battery life is mere 5 hours DVD play time, and price is over $1100.Other tablets that are portable, and has good battery life are usually Windows RT versions.  Given how stable Android OS on Galaxy Note 10.1, stability is no longer comparison point.  Just like iOS vs. Android, it becomes applications.  Windows RT edition only runs Metro specific applications.  Though they will certainly grow, it will likely to take sometime.  Given the rapid change in the technology, if you decide to buy a system with a hope that the application will come, you may end up not enjoying your system as by the time applications flourish on the metro market, there may be better spec systems with cheaper price.  Furthermore, it appears no Windows RT based system have stylus support.So in conclusion, though windows 8 tablet are not inferior by any means, there is no upcoming windows 8 tablet at this point can say \"absolutely better\" than the Galaxy Note 10.1 or even Transformer Infinity.  Both tablet have still their own places and target audiences.============= Original Review Below =====================Quick background of myself, I had recently purchased transformer infinity as upgrade from my ipad 2, and Samsung galaxy 10.1 4G.  It was a great tablet of its own, but had couple major negatives for the purpose of my use.  So I had to seek for alternative.  Given my relative unhappiness with Galaxy 10.1 original and 4G, I was a bit skeptical about Galaxy Note 10.1 but decided to give a chance.  The result after 3 days of use is \"amazing.\"  This should be the flagship/standard of Android tablet.In the review of Transformer infinity, I have discussed about iOS ecosystem vs. Android ecosystem.  In here, I am actually going to focus on comparing to the transformer infinity, which is by many major review sites rated as the best android tablet.  And I see several people are considering this vs. the infinity.WARNING: Do not trust some reviews you read on the websites.  I just do not experience/see the issues what some reviewers are saying.============  Summary ===============Compared to transformer infinityStrength+Stability+Speed+Audio/SpeakerWeakness-No HD screen-Samsung's very slow software update-UITie*Battery Life*Build Quality*Overall hardware spec*Future potentialNote: I did not mention S-pen nor multitasking here because I personally don't use S-pen, and multitasking is good but you can do pretty much the same with applications on the market on any android device.Conclusion:Do you want android tablet?Are you ok with not having HD display?Can you afford the price?If yes to all three, then this is the tablet to get.===========  Detail Review ================1. StabilityThis is in fact the biggest selling point of this tablet.  I was always under the impression that by choosing Android ecosystem over the iOS, one thing we have to give up is the stability.  So when I initially got the infinity, I had a hope but the hope of stability quickly went away.  Browser crushed/froze every hour or so.  Other applications also froze and crushed.  In android world, I guess it's called application not responding (ANR) error.  I don't think infinity had any more of ANR than the my old Galaxy 10.1 but definitely did not seem less.To my surprise, Galaxy Note 10.1 is actually extremely stable.  In fact, I have used so far approximately 20-30 hours and have not encountered a single ANR nor crush.  Having stable Android system is just an amazing.Winner: Galaxy Note 10.12. ScreenIf you have never used HD display tablet such as New Ipad, transformer Infinity or ACER Iconia A700, you would probably not notice.  But after using them for awhile, the sharpness of text produced by these high definition screen are certainly noticeable.  With infinity, i can load a page and without zooming in, I can basically read entire page because resolution is so good.  But with Galaxy Note, everything look somewhat blurry so I have to zoom in to really read.This is a huge disadvantage of Galaxy Note. And perhaps, the reason why every other aspect on Galaxy Note is better than Infinity because it does not have to drive HD.  If you need HD screen android tablet, you have to go with transformer infinity.  Even there is not much HD specific applications right now, you will notice the difference on every day use.Winner: Transformer Infinity3. SpeedAfter doing some custom tweek on my infinity, browsing on infinity became much faster (at least so it seemed).  When it is at maximum speed, infinity and galaxy browser loaded pages in equal speed.  I tested this by simply going to the same site at same time for couple pages.  But after couple hours of use, infinity browser always seemed to slow down or crush.  This does not depend on which browser I used stock, chrome, opera, firefox beta, dolphin beta etc.  The benchmark sort of show this.  Sunspider benchmark of infinity was decently fast so browser should be fast, which again it was when working.  But Galaxy Note 10.1's sunspider result is simply in another dimension.  It's even faster than new iPad.  Since stock is so well on the Galaxy Note, I have not really tried much else on galaxy note.Another example is I use Mantano Reader for my ebook reading. With infinity, I could not open couple files.  One was 50MB, the other was 400MB.  It simply took forever and gave me ANR.  If lucky and got it working after awhile, it only showed couple pages and then crush.  I sent email to Mantano asking for fix as I could not believe with such high spec on the Infinity can be an issue.  In fact, some files larger than 50MB opened fine on the Mantano.  Furthermore, other PDF applications such as Repligo, Adobe Reader opened these files fine as well.  So I had good reasons to blame on application itself.  But the same file opens instantaneously on Galaxy Note  and obviously no crush or ANR.So despite infinity being fast system on its own, I have to give this one also to Galaxy Note.Winner: Galaxy Note 10.14. Audio/SpeakerSpeaker on the infinity was simply a weakness.  So any system can win over this.  I am not expert on sound system, so all I cared was whether I can hear sound loud enough.  With infinity, some of my video files were only barely audible even with maximum sound setting if there are any background sounds.  This was different from any other tablet I owned.  Galaxy Note 10.1 is just like others I have no problem hearing sounds.  It is what I expected.With infinity I had issue on listening to video file that was on the microsd using headset.  Every minute or two, I hear small but definitely noticeable \"beep beep.\" This was fixed by copying files locally to the device. But this sort of defeats the purpose of microsd...  This issue is not there with Galaxy Note.  So I can keep video files on microsd.Winner: Galaxy Note 10.15. Software UpdateNo one can beat ASUS.  Their reputation on the software update is the best of all android tablet maker.  In fact, they have already released jelly bean on one of transformer line.  So it probably won't be too long for infinity either.  This will for surely be true for OS after jellybean as well.  In addition, Nexus 7 is made by ASUS and has very similar specification to transformer prime, so future proof in terms of software update on infinity is the best on the market.In comparison, Samsung is one of the worst in terms of software update.  One main reason is that they make their own touch wiz customization.  The original samsung galaxy 10.1 just recently got ice cream sandwich.  Samsung announced that Galaxy Note will be getting Jellybean by end of the year, so we will get it but I don't count on the time.  As far as the OS after Jellybean, who knows we may get it but that would be even further down the road and it may even become irrelevant at the point.Winner: Transformer InfinityHowever, there is a catch on this.  If the actual software is working perfectly, do we really need/care newer OS?  I was looking forward to Jellybean when I had infinity because I thought it would make the system faster, and possibly more stable.  However, Galaxy Note is already extremely fast, and perfect stability.  So I am not sure if I am much to look forward to in Jellybean.6. User InterfaceTransformer Infinity uses near stock interface.  Their widgets are very clean.  I loved their transparent weather, and date widget.  Touch Wiz on the other hand, I don't think as pretty.  Samsung Weather widget just don't fit well. This may be personal preference though.Winner: Transformer Infinity7. Build QualityThe actual external appearance of the tablet goes to infinity.  The metallic Zen design is really great.  It does look like expensive tablet.  On the other hand, Samsung has plastic and I even had my port plastic broken one time on my Galaxy 10.1 4G. Clearly, it is not common place for accidental damage as it is simply so hard to break the piece by intention.  But Samsung totally refused to fix it and asked for $100 to fix this even though I only had the tablet for 5 months.  So I am skeptical for the durability of plastic tablet.However, quality assurance seems better on Samsung. I had to try two Infinity.  Both had light bleed, one had loose screen i.e. I can get click sound by pressing corner, sticking button (first one was volume, second one was power).  According to XDA forum, this was very prevalent issue and pretty much most people had one or other.  Galaxy Note I have none of these, and seemed like forum is also pointing to the same direction with very minimal complain on these matters.Winner: Tie8. Battery LifeThis is one feature I could not tolerate initially with infinity.  It lasted 5 hours if I use browser.  If I play game, it lasted only 3 hours.  Watching video or reading ebook without any browsing is the only way to get close to 9.5 hours documented on the specification.  But in reality, I always surf net, so generally I could never get more than 6 hours from 100% full charge.  Galaxy Note's battery life is amazing.  Over 6 hours of screen time I was still at 50% one time.  Second time 9 hours of screen time including 2 hours of gaming, 3 hours of constant almost pure browsing, 2+ hours of local video, and rest are ebook reading, I still have 30% battery left.  This will undoubtedly gives me 10+ hours of browsing time.  In fact, I am guessing this can even give 12+ hours easily unless I play game.  Even with gaming probably 8-9 hours.Some review claims battery hours on this much shorter, or even compatible to infinity.  My guess on this is they only either compared video play not included browsing but even then the number won't much.  So most likely explanation is they used 3G version of Galaxy Note 10.1.In any event, battery life on Galaxy Note is simply amazing.  When comparing tablet to tablet, without a question Galaxy Note is better.  However, this becomes a bit more complicated with Infinity's selling feature which is extra battery containing docking station.  I did not realize the power of docking station until I actually purchased one.  But if I do not want to carry around extra-weight, I can simply think the docking station as a battery charger.  I can do something like use as tablet at work, then connect to dock when get a chance/want to use as laptop/watch video.  Even while I use the tablet recharges from the dock's battery.  As I drive back, the tablet continues recharge from the dock.  So by the time I go back home, I am ready to use the tablet for night time reading.  All I need is recharge the dock and essentially I can completely eliminate the time to wait for tablet getting charged though with Galaxy Note's extra long battery life, this may not be frequent issue.Winner: Tie9. Overall Hardware SpecificationThis is technical aspect.  No matter what the specification is, in the end user experience is everything; however, hardware spec can definitely affect the experience.  Generally speaking two are similar with one better on one regard but other on the other.CPU: Tie - Atuntu scores are basically the same.GPU: Samsung Galaxy Note - Galaxy Note has the best GPU in any of Android tablet on the market right now.  Still not up to the level of the new Ipad.  Given it has to push less pixels compared to infinity, stronger GPU further makes difference.  Having said this, I don't think there is any application on android market currently that pushes to their graphical limit.  So not sure if extra GPU power make much difference.I/O: Samsung Galaxy Note - Supposedly I/O issue has been discussed on transformer series before infinity.  But infinity still has it. It had improved with the latest firmware, but not solved.  There is speculation that this is indeed hardware level of issue i.e. can go only so much.  The speculation is coming from XDA developer who tested running things off of highspeed SD card gave much boost in the function when compared to local storage i.e. Flash storage is the conundrum.  This is reflected on the benchmark.  The infinity had RL benchmark score of 80-90's with the latest firmware (originally like 120's).  Galaxy Note has 20's. This actually does affect daily use as you save file, access file all requires reading and writing from flash drive.  Obviously, infinity is not 4 times slower than Galaxy Note but this may be reason why my PDF file opened fine on Mantano with Galaxy Note but not on Infinity.Memory: Samsung Galaxy Note - 2GB.  Since most tablet still has 1GB memory, we won't likely to see anything that require 2GB memory for awhile.  So it is only helpful when opening multiple applications i.e. you may be able to cache more application than before but otherwise, I am not sure if this helps much.Screen: Transformer Infinity - See above.In any event, both hardwares are the best in the market right now.  If these two system cannot handle any more update, application etc. then pretty much nothing else on the market can handle them any more either.  So as far as hardware goes, both are relatively future proof.10. Future PotentialASUS, the maker of Infinity, makes Nexus 7 and again it has similar spec as the infinity's ancestor transformer prime.  So it should have good support from Google as well as future application makers. Furthermore, recently ASUS became of the playstation partner.  So you will likely to see playstation games on it.Galaxy Note 10.1 on the other hand is made by Samsung, who makes one of the most popular smartphone Samsung Galaxy Series.  Since Galaxy Note and SIII etc. uses Exynos CPU design and the number of unit sold are so high, android software developers will/should continue support them and hence, also supporting Galaxy Note 10.1.Update (9/3):  Samsung just recently announced it is bringing Jellybean to Galaxy Note 10.1 \"very soon.\"  No solid time here, but compared to \"this year\", this sounds much more imminent.  Only the time will tell, but it would be interesting how quickly Samsung can make the update to change its reputation here.More interestingly, Galaxy Note 2 (handheld) device was just recently officially announced by Samsung.  This device is very similar to the Galaxy Note 10.1.  So new features coming to the Galaxy Note 2 is highly likely to be added to Galaxy Note 10.1 as well.  If you are interested in seeing what these features are, search for [GALAXY Note II] First Hands-on Video by Samsung on Youtube.  These features appear very unique (at least to me).Winner: Tie11. HandwritingFor those of you who thinks S-pen is just another stylus, it is not.  You can never write as small on iPad, or Infinity because simply technology is different.  So those who wants to have closest to the real pen and paper experience, you need inductive pen device like Galaxy Note.Updated 9/3/2012Coming from the background of looking into tablet PC when still relatively new (back windows XP era), one thing I can say to test whether stylus/pen on screen truly work or not is write as small as you can and see if the tablet can recognize your writing.  The conventional touch screen tablet like iPad, most of android tablet including transformer infinity, you will quickly notice the smallest you can write is not so small.  You have some applications to convert your bigger drawn handwriting into smaller text, but it certainly is not same experience as you were to write on the paper.Since I had time with this tablet, I had a chance to try this.  Well, the smallest the tablet recognizes is the smallest I can write.  So in this sense, Samsung did phenomenal job.  Perhaps, this may be the reason why they could not include full HD screen.Winner: Galaxy Note==============  Other less important features =================Other things that I personally don't think much important are followings:1. Split ScreenThere are many applications on the Google Play that already allows you to watch video, browse web, take note etc. while opening other window.  So it is nice to include as a free feature and emphasize such feature exist, but Galaxy Note's built in applications are limited to certain applications.  For instance, I cannot use built in browser to watch flash movie while I read ebook.  However, if I buy overskreen I can do that.  And overskreen is supported on transformer infinity as well.  So I don't think split screen should be decision maker for anyone.2. Keyboard dockThis is mainly the feature of transformer series.  But samsung does make keyboard dock.  Galaxy Note 10.1 version is not out yet, but it is in process.  The difference is that Galaxy Note one (probably) won't have extra battery.  But I don't think it needs that as by tablet alone it can last so long and probably even longer than Infinity with dock.  Form factor goes to the transformer as it attaches and closes like laptop.  My personal opinion about this is, it doesn't really make difference.  If I need keyboard I can still carry it.  The total weight is the same. So another factor, I don't think should be decision maker.=============== Conclusion ==================Update 9/15/2012Galaxy Note 10.1 is phenomenal device with its stability, speed, and extra function of S-pen.Galaxy Note and Transformer Infinity are definitely two of the best Android tablet on the market at this time.  Though all the major reviews only giving credit to Infinity, if you use Galaxy Note 10.1 you will know its power, speed and stability, which are even better than that of Infinity.  However, I have ended up choosing transformer infinity.  Because even when Galaxy Note is superior in pretty much every other aspect to Infinity except the screen, the full HD screen turned out to be such an major feature that infinity has(=note lacks).  I read ebook, surf web, and watch videos.  Basically, every second that I look at screen for these tasks I noticed the difference in screen resolution.  Though not to the level of the Note, with tweaks I got my infinity browsing speed faster, and system more stable. After these tweaks, these difference are only wastes several minutes a day of my time in the end i.e. accumulation of 10 seconds difference in loading flash heavy site, system force close/ANR 2-3 times more than Galaxy Note add up extra time of waiting for page to load and relaunching applications.It is not easy decision to make. You just need to weight what is important to you.", "Date": "August 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Student's Dream Tablet", "Author": "syngeek \"pixel385\"", "ReviewID": "R1UBWS805U1INN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my very first tablet and I love it so much!!I visited this tablet at my local electronics shop many times, read reviews, looked at available software, and even the reviews for the software prior to deciding to buy my Note. I've had it for about a month now and I thought I should share my experience so far for anyone else who's doing their homework before buying.I am a grad student. I've been carrying a laptop and tons of papers around for some time now. I had notebooks for random notes from meetings, TODO lists, and ideas. Notes from my classes, handouts, papers which I printed just so I could mark them up. Oh, can't forget the assortment of pens and pencils for that marking up. I also had all of my meetings and schedule info set up in my phone's calendar so I could have something beep at me with a reminder no matter what... with my schedule, forgetting things is very easy.The Samsung Note changed everything.I was initially excited about this product because of the Wacom stylus. I used to do professional graphic art and I loved my Wacom digitizer tablet. Anything less than that level of quality just won't cut it once you've experienced their tablets. I was tempted to try an iPad when I saw another student was able to take notes with that marker thing, but I'm so glad I waited and looked at the Note. Wacom really dominates and the quality just can't be beat.The pre-installed apps are pretty good, though I can see ways to make them better. I love S Note and use it for all of my note taking needs. The way it integrates with the calendar/todo list app is particularly nice. I can take meeting notes where I'm given some task to do, then click to \"Create Event\" which will let me attach the note to a new event on my calendar or todo list, complete with reminders, groups, prioritization, etc.. S Note with Calendar is so useful, it alone nearly made the purchase worthwhile.Another great feature of S Note (though the interface could seriously be improved) is the ability to recognize handwritten math functions, then look them up on Wolfram Alpha. I'm a CS student and I find that pretty useful and cool. The only trick to it is that it wants to open the browser in split screen mode. If you already have the browser in split screen mode, it doesn't work. Just close the split screen, then try it and it's fine. Like I said, interface could seriously be improved.I also needed a good app for marking up all those PDFs. I wanted to stop printing papers just to mark them up, discuss them, and set them aside, hoping I'd remember when needed. My solution was ezPDF which takes a PDF, makes a copy for annotating, then lets me draw all over it. I hear there are others that might be better, but so far this has been wonderful. My printer is loving the break. (I literally have reams of printed papers I've read or written...it was crazy!)There's also a nice deal Samsung has with Dropbox. I hadn't used this service prior to getting the tablet, but if you do a few trivial things like add another computer and watch a tutorial, the free Dropbox account is increased in size from 2 to 48 gigs. I added my laptop and desktop, then merged every paper I had plus class notes and more into the service so my resources are all pretty seamless between machines. Granted, you could use a cloud service like Dropbox with any device, so it's not really a selling point... still very nice though. I'm glad it was there in my face so I'd go try it. :) The interface with Google Drive is also really tight so you can easily sync apps like S Note with your Google Drive account. I was very concerned about how things would be backed up when I got the tablet - loss of data is a very scary prospect when getting away from paper.I feel like I've had a definite quality of life improvement with this device, but I'm still just scratching the surface of what it's capable of.Oh, I suppose I should address screen resolution, battery life, and all that.The battery lasts for a really really long time. I'm not sure just how many hours. I suspect I could use it for maybe two days without charging, assuming I don't watch any TV shows on it or anything. I went on a Dr. Who marathon a couple of weekends ago and it ran low after several episodes, starting from less than full charge. Even when it says it's critically low, it keeps going for quite awhile.The screen resolution is ok. It is not as high as the iPad's, but then, as I understand it, that sacrifice was necessary to support the Wacom tech in this form factor (low power processor, etc)- a worthy sacrifice. In any case, I can't say I've complained about the visible size of pixels in at least a decade so I'm not all that upset about it. I guess if I bought it just to consume media, I'd be upset, but for me, this is a tool first, toy second.So, to wrap it up:Pros:- Great for class notes! (Also, no more smudging if you're left handed like me!)- Mark up PDF presentations if your prof puts them up for download- Create and mark up PDF slides while teaching or tutoring, then give them to your students afterwards.- Like a brain extension when it comes to organizing.- Save paper and toner!- Stylus tech by Wacom - you just have to try it if you haven't before. It's really sweet, I swear.- Fun for doodling, if you like that.- You're free from Apple's walled garden, if you care about such things.- Speakers are on the front. Nice when you want to curl up in your blankets and watch some TV. (Audio isn't terrible either, given the form factor)Cons:- Screen resolution not amazing, but really not terrible either- S apps could use some UI improvements. Loads of potential, just not quite to the point of being stellar apps yet. I'm optimistic for them still and use them anyways.", "Date": "October 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Just awesome", "Author": "H. Yoon", "ReviewID": "RAGKE4ZO3IVTJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a graduate student in engineering and I was looking for a tablet that can be an alternative for papers. And I was debating between ipad and galaxy note 10.1 and I decided to go for the Note. I am really happy that I chose this tablet.First of all, the S note app is amazing. It is very responsive and accurate. And it's really fun as well! When I am bored, I just take the Note and write random things. Somebody below complained about the auto handwriting conversion to text. But I think it is almost impossible to convert the handwriting to text in a blink although I think it's still fast enough. And I could figure out the most of the problems that he had..And because I'm studying in engineering, I need to draw a lot of graphs , shapes, and formulas. And the auto shape match feature is the best part. I can draw anything very fast and it just makes them in the exact way that i want.Unfortunately, S-note is not pdf file friendly. Even though you can import pdf files into S-note, there are not many useful feataures for S-note. But of course you can download any pdf annotation app from the market. I found this app, EZpdf, and they optimized the app for galaxy note so that when the stylus pen is near the screen, your palm is not recognized like S-note so the annotation is perfect. Also, you can organize your files and you can search the meaning of words that you select in either dictionary or wikipedia right away.So trust me. If you are a student, I don't think there is any other tablet that can satisfy you than this one. I know that ipad has many good note apps but what is the point of using them if there is no palm rejection feature?Other than taking notes, the performance is also blazing fast. I always complained that even screen scrolling is not smooth for androids compared to ipad but I think Samsung optimized this tablet very well. Even when you are doing the multiscreen, there is no lag at all (except that it takes 0.5 seconds to move to another screen). With the 2gb rams, you can open unlimited number of tabs in your web browser.About the resolution.. If you are not going to read the Bible which is full of very tiny letters, i don't think you will have any problem to read articles or papers. And this resolution doesn't make any difference for vidoes since 1080x720 is a standard resolution for tablet. Correct me if i'm wrong.For watching videos or netflix, I really like that they put a dual speakers in front of the screen. It's very loud and clear. In my opinion, it's a huge difference from other tablets in terms of watching movies or listening to musics.I am not an art person but I take pictures a lot. And the phothoshop touch that comes with this is amazing. There are a lot of tutorials inside and it's easy to learn. With the s-pen, it is very fun to edit pictures. It is another thing that I like the most.The only downside is that you need enough time to get used to the software. Since there are a lot of features, you have to play around with it for a while. For me, it took about 2 hours to be friendly with the interface. But it's like when you are new to android and have to spend some times to get used to the interface.Summary. If you are a student who needs to take notes and annotate pdf or slides, you SHOULD get the Note 10.1. With this, I am not going to bring any backpack and notes.

Liu", "ReviewID": "R3J9F7FQMAAZQ6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've refrained from buying a tablet for several years now. I've ogled the ipad and the new ipad for many years now, but I've not purchased a tablet because I have a smart phone (HTC evo 4G) and a laptop and a tablet just seems like a duplication of what I already have.  However, times are a changing and I'm seeing how the right tablet can enhance my work life (I\"m an attorney).  So, for my 2012 birthday, my husband \"gave\" me a tablet.First, I bought the new Ipad. Then, I returned the Ipad because it is incompatible with everything in my house and work.  I don't want to install ITunes everywhere I want to be able to plug my tablet in to download/upload documents.  I also didn't like how on ipad you can only line up the Apps in little rows. I like to put my apps around borders and group them..Second, from Costco, I bought the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 and played around with it. I really liked it, but I feel like between the Samsung 7 inch tablets and the Note 10.1, the Tab 2 10.1 is the Jan Brady of the lot... so.. this leads me to the Note 10.1.I was able to conduct a side by side comparison of the Tab 2 10.1, the Note 10.1 and the Ipad.  The Note (and Galaxy Tab 2) were noticably lighter and thinner than the Ipad.  The screen on the Samsungs were also slighly (like 1/2 inch) larger than the Ipad.What I really liked (and grew accustomed to from my HTC Android phone) was that when you plug the tablet into your laptop, the laptop recognizes the tablet as a connected device.  Conversely, the Ipad did nothing more than open up Itunes.  Further, when I dropped a document (.pdf or WORD) into the Note 10.1, I could see it actually syncing with the device.  Then when I turned on the Note 10.1 to find the document, it was easy to locate!  Conversely, on the ipad, I had to download a $4.99 .pdf viewer and a $9.99 word processing application, and then upload the documents via Itunes before I could make my documents work.  Since my home and office set up don't include any Apple products, the Ipad just is not a convenient option for me.Now the I also noticed a difference between the Note 10.1 and the Tab 2 10.1 in speed (the Note was just a tad quicker), and just the feel was just more smooth.The S pen: I uploaded a .pdf document and was able to use the S pen to make notes on the document.  That was pretty cool and much neater than writing with my finger.Control:  I'm a control freak. I want to put the app icons wherever I want them. I also like to arrange them by group around the perimeters of the screens.  I can do this on the Samsungs.  I also find the Samsungs to be every bit as intuitive as the Ipad was.Apps: There are maybe 2 apps that the Itunes store has that I \"need\" in the Android app market, but all of the other apps that I already purchased for my Android phone were readily and easily available for download from the Google Apps store (\"PLAY\").  One app in particular- ironically- the AMAZON mobile app- was not available for use on the Samsung Tablets.  The other app was a e-transcript reader.I'm really happy with this purchase and my very first tablet.", "Date": "October 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "I'm finished, finally.", "Author": "Allen Alberti", "ReviewID": "RRD6ILBHI7T2I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This review is going to be short because you can already read about the specs on this tablet everywhere.

I'm glad i didnt after reading actual USER reviews, and forums such as xda developers give much more enlightened information.Although i am still getting my feet wet after just a few days of ownership, i am very happy with my investment.This tablet is the perfect bridge for me between a smart phone and desktop, and in many ways adds functions that even a highend desktop is incapable of, in particular the stylus s-pen input. Personally i wanted to be able to use the device for drawing and photo manipulation, as i am a photographer/graphic artist. Is it perfect? No, but ive been using Photoshop since about vs.1 and seen it grow by bounds. PS Touch is still an infant, but is usable, it can only get much better with updates and new versions.If the prospect of writing drawing and input with a pen is not for you, then by all means maybe you should look for an alternative with a \"better\" screen. The pen input is the whole point (pun intended) of this device, and even though this is new to tablet tech, it works quite well. I have used a Wacom input tablet for years on my destop, but was always frustrated by the hand on tablet while looking at monitor issues. As an artist being able to draw on the device is so much more intuitive, precise, and FUN...the way it should be. Thats not to say there is not a learning curve with the softwares. But being able to bring a device this size with you anywhere and draw paint etc, without a bevy of actual paint tubes, pencils, other medium, is just amazing. The software is somewhat limited as yet, but is still useable and should only get better as developers and users realize how useful and desirable this can be. I am using Touch as well as Autodesk Sketchbook, Infinite Paint/Design, FrescoPro, among others so far.The battery life is just amazing...this thing can literally go all day long. If you dont use it continuously all day it can last for days without charging.Does it feel cheaply made? Not to me. But im more concerned with what i can use it for instead of the look or color of the shell or the brand logo emblazed on it. Seems quite sturdy and mine doesnt creak in my hands.I got the 16gb version as it was readily available, and i added a 64gb card to the slot, for less than the $50 extra for the 32g model. Thank you so much for adding the card slot, Samsung!The audio quality is very good. The builtin speakers are great for their size, lack bass, but have clean clarity. The actual output is very good though. Ive read that the opamp is made by Wolfson but cant confirm, it is comparable to the SQ of the GalaxyNexus phone though. My preferred music player is PowerAmp (amazing sq and user tweaking).Wifi and Bluetooth work very well. Great signal with good range. No problems connecting to any bt devices so far. Have also used my Epson 645 to print from tablet wirelessly.Email and browser apps work great as does the Multiscreen with limited but useful apps.This review was written using the Note with the on-screen keyboard.I will try to update with more information as i use the Note more. So far i am extremely happy with this tablet!*** UPDATE (10-7-2012):Still loving my Note.Am using several art apps successfully on the tablet, including AutoDesk SketchBook (i'm using the full paid version), Infinite Painter, FrescoPro, and ZenBrush.So far, really like it. The S-pan is pretty precise and i think there are a good many levels of gradation/pressure sensitivity.PS Touch is usable for editing photos on the fly. \"NexusMediaImporter\" is a great app for dowloading raw files into your Note.You will need this or similar adapter, which works quite well for the cheap price:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005YWIRBS/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00(Sanoxy Female USB OTG adapter) which allows you to hook up a flash card reader or a USB thumb drive to your tablet. With the app you can see your files and download them into the tablet from the card or drive. I use the app on my smartphone as well (GalaxyNexus) to be able to able and transmit photos out of my DSLR in the field (i'm a photojournalist), and it works quite well.If you have read the comments, you'll see that a 64gb sd card will work great in the Note 10.1, AFTER the latest ICS upgrade to 4.04. Otherwise, you will need to reformat some of the newer cards that come formatted in the exFAT format to FAT32. But if you are just getting your Note, i would suggest waiting until you get the update before using the card so you can just use the exFAT format.My particular card is a Sandisk \"MobileUltra\" SDXC card with a Class10 rating. It works great in the Note, and i have over 50gb of content on it, including music (MP3) and photo (JPG) files.I have also opened text files, including MS WORD documents, that will successfully open using the included PolarisOffice app on the Note, and are then editable in Polaris ;) which seems to be a very nice included software on the tablet.Also, i just dont understand the reviews, comments on the Note's so-called horrid screen resolution. It seems quite sharp to me. No, it doesnt have the 'HD' resolution of some newer devices, but it is my no means bad. It is punchy with good blacks and looks plenty sharp at the normal viewing distance of a 10\" screen. I have also downloaded and am using different fonts, with i think look even sharper to my eyes.The Note10.1 is a nice tablet for the price, and is quite functional to actually DO THINGS with. Until the MS Surface tablets appear and we see how well the new Win8 touch interface works, S-pen is among the very best interfaces for writing and art there is at the moment, and the price is quite reasonable for this technology.***UPDATE 10-19-2012A few more comments with more use:The Polaris app will view, open, edit files including Word, PDF, etc., and is a very useful and well developed app.The sound quality of this device is very good, particularly when using apps such as PowerAmp to tweak the sound.Battery life is EXCELLENT, i can use the Note for generally 2-3 days of use (with at least 2-3 hours a day) before a recharge.Reading works well on the Note as well, including Kindle, Aldiko, Nook, and YouVersion apps. Also using some digital magazine subscriptions.As i almost waited for the release of MS Surface, with the price now being known to be $600 (with the keybord cover), i am happy i didnt. That's for the RT version, not the full Win8 version to be released next year, with a much higher price to be announced.And the Note's touch interface with S-pen is i'm sure still a more advanced input, as well as the limited app availability for WindowsRT at the moment.", "Date": "October 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Finally found a tablet that works like it should.", "Author": "Dave S \"Dave\"", "ReviewID": "R11TL419DKRBOK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I waited a long time and did alot of research before buying my first android tablet.

This device is AMAZING. It does everything you need a tablet to do from watching videos, downloading all kinds of apps, listening to music, surfing the web, reading books, and most of all TAKING NOTES.My laptop has been gathering dust for a long time now since I got the Note 10.1. I use it on a daily basis for all sorts of tasks from balancing my checkbook to taking notes to playing games and even word processing.The word processing is a bit of a headache on any device without a good quality physical keyboard. I bought a Logitech keyboard for Android and now even word processing is a breeze on this (especially with good applications like Kingsoft, PowerWriter, and the built-in Polaris). You really can't go wrong with this device. It easily beats out the iPad (which I also own, the third generation) in everything except perhaps display (which is better on the iPad). The multi-tasking is just plain ridiculous on the Note 10.1 (ridiculous as in amazing -- sorry for the slang). You get Android 4.0 on the device initially, and that allows for multi-tasking. But when you update your software to the Jellybean version (4.1, I believe), you feel almost like you're on a computer. For a number of apps, you can use split screen, resize windows, etc. The other day I was able to keep open my Lecture Notes app (for handwriting notes), my Polaris app (for viewing documents), my calculator, a music player, and I'm still able to open more like movies, and YouTube and an Web browser! And if you can't find your window, just hit the windows icon on the bottom and it shows a list of open windows. You can even close out one or more windows (either individually or all at once) with a simple swipe or tap.Then it also comes with dual speakers so if you don't have earphones, you can still easily hear the video or music you're listening to. It's so easy to watch videos and movies and shows on it in landscape with those speakers when you're with company. Also, let's not forget its main feature: The S-Pen! Another amazing innovation by Samsung. This is especially useful for students, artists, and business people. You can write as though you were using a pen and paper. You might wonder the usefulness of it, but trust me, you can do so much on a tablet with that kind of capability. It comes built in with photoshop which I don't use but everyone I know seems to rave over...and the S-Pen seems to be a natural tool for this app. For apps that I use like S-Note, the ability to type something and then draw an illustration or a chart or write out an equation/formula saves me so much time and effort. The handwriting recognition is also one of those features that when you try it you, you'll wonder how the heck did you live without it?Going from this to the iPad was a major step down. I own both and use both, but this is a far superior machine with far superior functions. I personally think that this is not only the best Android tablet out there currently, but that it is better than any tablet so far ever made. This device not only makes things like gaming, movies, etc. possible and enjoyable, but goes a step further by making the tablet a serious tool for actual work like writing and note-taking and editing images, etc.While I can go on and on about how much I love the tablet and how great it is compared to the competition with all its features and capabilities, there are going to be some drawbacks naturally as no device is perfect. The battery life is good, but that's because I rarely take it off Power Saving mode and only occasionally type on it. The built-in S-note is limited to some extent in that it doesn't carry with it other useful features found in ordinary word processors like word count. As a handwriting app, it's great, but I find myself using Lecture Notes more (a couple of bucks on the Play store) because the size of each page on the latter as well as the ability to customize between college ruled or wide ruled (or blank) makes it feel more like paper when writing notes completely by hand. Accessories don't seem to be anywhere near as common (if a lot even exist) for this device as for the competition especially as for the iPad. Keyboard cases designed for the Note 10.1 are horrible made-in-China products that work only barely and are not suitable for fast and/or accurate typing. Even Samsung's keyboard dock for this device doesn't even exist in the US as of yet, and if you're in the States and want to buy one, it looks like you're going to have to settle for one from Europe, like the UK (though I've heard there are some US onlne stores that have their hands on these and selling them here). The display does not match the iPad's no matter how much better the Note is than the iPad. It's not a \"bad\" display by far, but the Retina Display is simply crisp and beautiful to look at. Also, I don't like the 10.1\" design (others may disagree). I feel that a shape like the iPad's is more practical for writing notes and doing things like playing games, but that might just be a very personal preference. (In case you don't know, the Note 10.1 is longer/larger than the iPad by a bit, but it is more rectangular in shape while the iPad comes closer to a square in shape, but not quite a square.)I don't know what else to say: if you have any questions, just ask and I'll be happy to reply.My final opinion: I think that this device convinced me that the tablet can be seriously used as a device for work as well as pleasure, and that accessory makers should start focusing on this product for making keyboards, cases, etc. I also feel that this tablet should convince developers to focus more on Android apps than on iOS apps simply because devices like this allow for so much more flexibility and because I see this as leading the way for more innovative Android products in the future.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND.", "Date": "February 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung hits a bulls-eye", "Author": "Omalika S. Lipp", "ReviewID": "R1MNFKULY130X8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received this tablet from Amazon last Thursday as a \"warehouse deal\" - it was pretty much brand new - no detectable wear or flaws whatsoever. The top of the box had a \"Quality Control\" check-off sheet stating that the data had been wiped, factory reset was completed, and everything was inspected. Even the plastic peel-off things on the Note was intact. If a warehouse deal is available, definitely jump on it.This is my first tablet, but I'm quite a tech-junkie, so I'd rate myself as an \"advanced user\".I won't beat a dead horse here. The five hundred or so reviews before mine can give you plenty of insight into the S-Pen, the processing power, the battery life, etc. Rather, I'm here to touch on what has been overlooked by other reviewers, and to rate the entire unit as a whole.Things I found out after I bought the tablet:-Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean was released for this tablet only a few days ago. Being able to play with the tablet before and after the upgrade has let me see how much more improved this Android version is... and it is stellar. Besides the obvious stability fixes, it just... works! The applications and user interface is SMART. I can't stress this enough. The apps work with each other (Dropbox and QuickPic are good examples), and the interface is great (custom home-screen, widgets, etc.). When I open a file in Photoshop, it asks me what source I want to use. I have more shortcuts to apps than I know what to do with. I can switch between applications flawlessly. When I downloaded a 3.5gb game, it asked me if I wanted to save to external SD instead of on-board memory (YES!). When I try to charge it from a source that doesn't provide enough power (it needs 5v 2A), the tablet tells me that it is receiving inadequate power. When I plug in a USB external hard drive to the tablet, the tablet tells me that the USB device requires too much power to operate (stick with the thumb drives, or AC adapter powered external HDDs). I even tried connecting the tablet to the USB adapter to a USB SD card reader and finally to an SD card. It accessed the SD card witout any issues. Coming from my HTC Desire HD as my last Android device, these are huge advancements in interoperability and ease-of-use.-iOS is inherently better. This is a sacrilegious statement, I know, but hear me out. iOS comes out-of-the-box with stellar capabilities and performance, not to mention having great customizability. On the other hand, Android comes with some very, very quirky issues out-of-the-box (How about the fact that I can't set a lock-screen wallpaper that isn't a square? I have a 16:10 screen and you force me to use 1:1... WHY?). But, the upside is that there is an app and a fix for everything. If you find something quirky and poorly designed within the Android OS, chances are, someone else came across the same issue and wrote an app to address said issue, usually for free. On the other hand, while iOS is inherently more robust, the expansion and app-based fixes are much more limited. If you find something quirky and weird in iOS, chances are, you're stuck with it forever. This means that Android is weaker off the starting line, but as you customize the OS and add your own personal tweaks and such, it will eventually surpass iOS.-This thing is solidly built, with a beautiful screen. Don't listen to the naysayers about how pixilated text is, because it really isn't. 1280x800 with a 10.1\" screen gives you 150 pixels per inch (PPI). For reference, the 15\" MacBook Pro Retina has 220 PPI (113 PPI for non-Retina), and the iPad Retina has 264 PPI (132 PPI for non-Retina).As far as the build quality goes, I haven't noticed a \"creak\" or \"squeak\" when I flex the tablet. Then again, I don't use my tablet as a torque wrench. I keep it in a book-like case and treat it as if it cost me two car payments (which it did). And I assume most people who buy one of these will do the same. Why worry about things that aren't an issue?However, there are some quirks to Note (haha, get it?).-The 3.5mm headphone jack is on the top of the tablet. This makes it kind of awkward to use when the tablet is standing upright with a case, as you have to route the cable behind and around the screen in order to prevent it from obstructing your view.-You can't choose the location of your Google Play store. I live in Japan and want to shop the American Play store. However, because it detects my IP address as originating from Japan, it forces me to use the Japanese store. The only way to circumvent this is to use a VPN or some other more questionable methods. On the other hand, Apple's App Store lets you select the region you want to shop from. Luckily for most of you this won't be an issue.-There isn't a solid-quality keyboard case yet. iPads have a plethora to choose from, but this tablet only has a handful, and none are very well reviewed. Your best bet is to have a small Bluetooth keyboard if you need to do some serious typing, until a good case/keyboard combo is manufactured.The bottom line: This thing rocks. Whatever purpose you need a tablet for, you'll find some unbelievably amazing things that are possible and most likely completely unrelated to what you originally purchased this tablet for. One thing that comes to mind is cloud-based video editing. Edit videos on your tablet, the file is compiled/rendered off-site on a high-powered computer, and the final product is sent back or available on the cloud. The capabilities are literally endless.Just do yourself a favor, stop shopping around, and buy this tablet. If you don't like it, send it back.

It is truly great for productivity and for minimizing the amount of papers you have to carry. It is great to:1. Take notes at school on PDFs given out by professors. Before I had to print out the slides before class, take notes, and then carry them around for weeks to be able to study them. Carrying around all those notes was so messy not to mention heavy! I now just download the lecture slides and take notes using annotate or use the multi-screen option by using s-note.2. I do all my homework on this. I just use s-note to do all my homework (I'm taking several science classes) and before I needed to carry around several color pens, and erasers and papers just to be able to do my homework. Now I just create a document in s-note, export it, and upload it using dropbox, and then I can print it from any of my devices linked to my dropbox account. You also get 48GB of dropbox for 2 years just for purchasing the tablet.3. It is great to take notes during meetings too.4.

I used all three of them several times a day for a period of three weeks. The Nexus 7 was nice, but was too small for tethering to my DSLR and lacked a micro SD port. The Asus was slow, uncomfortable to hold, and the high resolution screen meant that many of my apps would no longer run on it. So I gladly returned the Nexus 7 and Asus TF700T, and kept the Samsung Note 10.1 for myself. I own a photography studio and need to provide my artists with updated technology on a regular basis. This means I have been very fortunate to use over a dozen different/new computers every year...Without any exaggeration, the Note 10.1 is the absolutely best tablet I have ever owned or tested. That's not to say that it's \"perfect\". (If you are looking for \"perfect\", that's not a realistic/possible expectation to begin with.)The Wacom technology built in is a godsend to any student, professional, or artist who wants a more effective way to interface with the tablet and do work or take notes. NOTE: The small pen is pretty cute, but I never use it. I bought a $10 Axiotron Pen instead. That pen is light weight too but full size, allows for ordinary Wacom nibs to be used, and gives the full pressure sensitivity you'd expect from a Wacom device.Other things I like about the Note 10.1:- Samsung's two frontal speakers are amazing for a tablet, and honestly are better sounding than many lighter laptops.- The tablet's rounded edge design makes it easy to hold in your hand.- Speedwise, this tablet soars. It was far faster at running the same software than the Asus TF700T was.- The interface is more enjoyable to use and feels more refined than the Google Nexus 7's was.- There are so many different little \"EXTRAS\" added to this tablet that it's enormously fun just to play around with, such as the ability to control most the electronic devices in your home, and the haptic/vibration feedback when playing games.- When sitting in the mall studying on the couches, I use the remote control feature of the Note 10.1 to clandestinely lower the Mall's main TV volume or change the channels without anyone else knowing how it happened. Ha ha..The reason I bought all three tablets was because I read a couple ridiculously bad reviews for this particular product on smaller \"so-called professional tablet websites\". I wanted to test the tablets for myself and make my OWN best decision. After using the Samsung Note 10.1 and seeing how powerful, smooth, and FUN it is to use and work on, the only thing I can guess is that those \"few other sights\" were being bribed by Apple to give bad reviews for anything Samsung makes? Out of all the complaints I read on those other reviews, half of what they said was a pure lie, and the other half was user stupidity. (After owning the Samsung Note 10.1 for myself, I cannot believe how absurd those initial reviews were.)But seriously, don't take my word for it! Buy this Samsung Note 10.1 and any other tablet you are curious about. Compare them carefully for a couple weeks. I bet you will do just as I did: return the other tablet(s) and very happily keep the Samsung Note 10.1 instead!", "Date": "September 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Comparing it to the 4th gen iPad when used for graphics / art", "Author": "Rick V \"Bargain hunter by day, shopaholic at ...", "ReviewID": "RCH6UQRD296ZW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Since the are already so many reviews on here for this item I thought I would add a specific angle. One that focuses on the use of the tablet as a graphics design tool mostly.I will also spend a moment discussing my other uses for the tablets I own and tell you what my experience is.Background you can skipI am not necessarily an Apple fan. As a matter of fact, I was always the type of guy building PC's, creating FreeNAS servers, experimenting with software etc. more Microsoft than Apple.The adoption of Apple into my household came when I started to buy computers for my Dad, nephews and nieces and MIL. Due to distance it became aggravating to get the calls where they were stuck with a blue screen or something else after downloading some virus or upgrading some driver. It was always something. So I decided that I would buy a tablet to see if my dad would be able to use that. That was e first Apple device into my home.I liked the usability, simplicity of the interface and the Apple-typical lack of buttons. All in all, I was pleased with how fast my 80+ year old dad was able to use it. No reboots, complex downloads or installs etc.then cam iMacs and time machines and MacBooks.I found that I spent way less time fixing computers and instead was using them. I was a believer.I stuck with the iPads and am currently on the 4th gen. Since iPads are invading my workspace I find myself using it mostly and running into some of the limitations.How I use the tabletsI mostly use my tablet work wise for the development of graphics for presentations that outline complex solutions. We do not use standard PowerPoint stuff but have a philosophy of custom and hand drawn pictures that can, if necessary, be Peter live on a whiteboard.Since the ipad does not have any native pressure sensitivity I had to wait until someone came out with a pressure sensitive stylus. At this point there are a few on the market and after looking at reviews I settled for the Jot Not Touch. I mainly use it with Sketchbook Pro, Touchdraw and so on.Here are the limitations I have found:- the disk tip that is needed for precision on the ipad is still somewhat inaccurate and hard to handle. I often have to press screen buttons multiple times to get it to register.- the pressure sensitivity seems to go off and on. Sometimes I find myself pressuring harder and harder to get the same results. This makes for lots of time spent handling the stylus and ipad combo rather than thinking about the quality of my graphics design- the styluses for the ipad that have reassure sensitivity either have weird tips or are bulky to handle. I am 5'11\".I also use the ipad to communicate via iMessage with all my family all over the world. iMessage is so simple and effective and I get it everywhere.without ads and other nonsense.Finally,and this is quite important once your have the Apple drug in your house: I have connected my home with a series of Airports and time machines. The airports connect to various stereo systems and apple TV's and I can simply control. Everything from my ipad, or my wife from hers.it is supremely easy and connected at a fraction of the cost I would have had if I bought the Sony or Bose solutions for this.Now about the GN10.1I bought it because I was working on another graphics project and got fed up with the clumsy stylus and ipad combo. I even paid overnight rush shipping to get it. And you know what, the Samsung embedded pressure sensitive stylus is so much better than the solution needed with the ipad. The tip is precise, the stylus is the right size, perhaps a little too light and thin but better than what I had for the ipad.I have spent less time messing with the hardware and more time on my work, so great kudosto Samsung.Also, the GN is fast, there is nothing to complain about with the 1.4 quad core compared to the ipad.The screen, however, on the ipad, is visibly better when. Drawing thin lines. It doesn't brother me too much since I can simply zoom in and the pixelation disappears but I can't wait for the next GN gen to see if samsung is going to up the ante and increase screen resultion.I also noted that the battery of the GN seems to notably outlast the ipad battery. My guess is that it outlasts my ipad battery by an extra 30% or so. Maybe because the Bluetooth stylus on the ipad hogs battery? I dunno, but again, Samsung gets it right-er, erer...So conclusion: as a graphics tablet solution the Samsung is hands down the winner. Ipad should not even be considered as a mature solution. The retina display is the only redeeming quality.When it comes to messaging etc... It's criminal what junk sits in the Google Play store. Everything seems invested with adware and when you buy versions with no ads you are looking at tons of different solutions... Which nes will your friends be willing to use? Now your friends have to start adding software to message you if you do not make the right pick. Especially when you have your friends and family spread over the globe.That is what I feel is really needed: a native android version of iMessage that works between any and all androids. Bridging into iMessage is not androids responsibility but for crying out loud, I don't want to download and pay for tons of crappy messaging software that does not let me reach my friends and family.  Apple wins.I am using Skype on both,  but find myself more on the ipad with iMessage to stay in touch.Finally, the integration into my household with the airports and stereo links. Luckily my synology audio android software can speak.  Airport, so there is a solution albeit a little bit jerryrigged. This android audio app streams and controls music on any synology diskstation and can feed it into your apple network if need be.  Apple, since they have a vertical solution that you can expand with, is very well integrated. Apple wins.I love both tablets, am deeply impressed with the Samsung solution since its not a simple copy and steal solution and love the ipad for its simplicity. However, for what I use them for work wise I would part with my ipad and stick with the Samsung given the graphics execution. Apple needs to step up in that area or they will lose out in schools, hospitals etc as the stylus model for note taking comes way more natural than thumbing your comments and notes.Sorry, for the avalanche of words.

Not surprisingly I'm very happy with it - it has met and exceeded my expectations. In my particular case my netbook had a battery problem and getting a new one represented a decent fraction of the cost of something else. That and I only had one application that still used XP and I found a way around that on another PC.  Late last year I got a Kindle Fire and this spring I went for a smartphone.  So I had some experience with Android, although in the Fire's case it was pretty well wrapped up in the name of \"ease of use\".I'm not an Apple user - no particular reason other than I've been that way over 30 years. When looking for alternatives I can't say I even seriously considered an iPad.  I did look at the new retina display and, honestly, my eyes (older) can't make a case for the differential between the new iPad and the Note 10.1 on that issue. The device seems physically pretty solid to me so I can't see an issue here either. As I have with all portable electronics, I got a case (with a Bluetooth keyboard included - not high speed but it works) and put on a screen protector (just like on my smartphone). To me that's common sense; you have to judge your own risk level and the protections aren't that expensive relative to the device itself.Why Samsung? I've had good luck with their products (TV's, range, etc.) and to be honest, I resent Apple's claims to have \"invented\" things like rounded corners - more the shame of the idiots who granted them patents.But why the Note 10.1?  I had a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 on order but having seen the limits (reasonable I think given the media focus) placed on Android app's in that environment, I was interested in something more open.  I like to use a stylus and the Note appeared to be built around it.  So with the need to replace a laptop and a desire for something with less confining an application set, the Note 10.1 seemed to be the place to go. (I think my existing Kindle Fire will still be good for quite a while, particularly when traveling.)Rather than talk about pro's and con's, I'd rather talk about my experience getting to know the Note 10.1.  First, I'd recommend that you get the Samsung SPSN app which gives you access to a set of videos, some of which focus on the Note 10.1.  Like most devices these days, everything is either \"intuitive\" or buried somewhere on-line if you can find it.  My intuition needs a boost now and then.View the available videos and you'll realize that the S Pen is pretty powerful and potentially useful.  You'll also get some tips on the various app's that support it. (As an aside, the S Note application appears to have different capabilities depending on how you invoke it.)  I'd also recommend you try a drawing/art application; in my case I'd simply say the most common wasn't my choice for the best.  With the right app you can do some really neat things fairly easily.  I have yet to make it through the PS Touch tutorials (they've \"intuitive\" sort of - but I've found going to see their videos helps as well).  I think this will be a useful app as well.  As for S Note, I can't say it recognized my writing yet.There are some issues. If I want to print, I need a compatible Samsung printer (I have an HP).  But then again my HP isn't color and maybe I'll go for one for the art as well as photo's in general - Samsung printers get high ratings for color.What's next?  Well first, my wife seems interested - the last time she got interested I received my first Kindle and she took it over in a few weeks.  She tells me she can see better on the Note than on the PC (she had a detached retina a few years ago).  So I may end up with two of these one of these days.I really don't see, in my future, any more laptop/ultrabooks based on what this device can do.  For someone who bought his first PC in 1980 that says something.  I'll have a desktop for the high end stuff, like video editing, but I think the world has changed.  The Note 10.1 may not be everything, but it's enough to be a game changer, for me at least.  If you're thinking about a tablet, I suggest you give this device a careful look.  Check around for comparison videos, they may help you as well.", "Date": "October 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Simply the best", "Author": "S.

I purchased the galaxy Tab 2 exactly a month ago, but ended up returning it and waited for the Note. Wasn't that a smart move. The Tab just did not have it together. The screen was not very sensitive (compared to iPad and Asus brands), it was laggy, crashed several times, and the camera was laughable at best with no auto focus. PDF annotation was simply horrible. iPad and Asus tablets did a much better job annotating PDFs with the same capacitive pen than Tab.Galaxy Note on the other hand is a solid tablet. The screen is very responsive. The S-Pen is just perfect; although, I still haven't figured out how to use the back eraser. I was afraid that resting my hand on the screen while taking notes would produce artifacts, but it did not. One thing that I hadn't tried with the Tab was the Peel Remote feature. I had a lot of fun controlling my TV and DVR with this app. It's a very interactive and fun way to watch TV. You won't go back to the DVR remote if you give this app a try. I don't know if other tablets have the remote feature, but if they don't, this feature alone is worth getting the galaxy for.The back camera is 5MP, has a flash, and can auto focus. The Adobe Photoshop touch comes with some nice filters and many of the tools found in the actual software (Gradient, Fill & Stroke, Wrap, Camera Fill, Round corners, B&W;, Color Replacement, Curves, Shadows/Highlights, Noise Reduction, etc). The S note app allows you to take notes or even write math equations. You can write down anything from simple algebra to differential equations and it will solve it by Wolfarm Mathematica in a side window! Pretty amazing. Oh yes, and the side window...is great.Overall, I'm happy with this tablet. If you are deciding between this or the Tab or any other lower priced tablet, you should seriously consider the Note. It's indeed worth the extra $100.", "Date": "August 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good device....needs a few improvements", "Author": "damien", "ReviewID": "R86O6DAMNQWQD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So I got my Note 10.1 a few days ago a I`ve been playing with it, both for work and recreation.  First off, from a hardware perspective, I would have given it 4.5 stars.  For the naysayers who complain about the screen resolution and compare it to the Retina display on the iPad, my first comment is guess what?  This is NOT a TV and was never intended to be.  We`ve gone from black and white to 12\" color TVs all the way to easily available 60\" LED TVs....why would I want to revert to a 10\" screen to watch movies etc....that`s what my 42\" is for.  As a mobile device, the screen is quite adequate and brings the cost down. I actually see absolutely no problem with the graphics from the few videos I have watched.  Besides which, Samsung MAKES the Retina display, so their not including a similar display on their tab is sending a message.  It`s not needed.Storage-wise, all hail Samsung for the micro-SD slot....one would have thought that this would be a given for any tab, but...Camera-wise, it`s alright. Again, the device is not meant to be a camera...that`s what my Nikon and Sony are for.  For snapping random shots and posting online, it`s excellent.  Also the only tab with a flash!  Video chatting works great as well. So still 4.5 stars at this point.  My main contention hardware-wise is the location of the port, and the fact that it`s a Samsung-proprietary rip off of the iPad port, plus its location.  I love the USB connectivity, but the location is terrible.  This device is meant to be used mainly landscape, which means, either in hand or propped up on a case.  For the connection to be on the bottom is COMPLETELY impractical, as you have to lie the unit down to use any of your connections.  It`s fine if you have a dock, but nobody walks around with their dock...defeats the mobility of the unit.  There should be a micro or mini USB port on the left side of the device (in landscape) so that it can be used in landscape or portrait while propped up on a stand.  So 4.5 stars on hardware  Love the S pen by the way.  Can`t wait for more apps to use its functionality as well as that of the quad core processor.Where the device lost some points with me is from a software perspective, which is from both a Samsung perspective and a Google perspective.  First off, I agree with some of the other reviewers when it comes to the UI....less is really more....don`t need all the widgets, they just slow me down.  A standard android interface would have been fine.  Secondly, given that this is an android device, one would expect google products to work seamlessly with it....nope...Chrome is quite frankly rubbish on this device. It locks up and the formatting is ridiculous.  I`ve had to download Firefox for Android. MAJOR peeve:  This is a mobile device which most people are going to use as a web device.  NO JAVA SUPPORT????  So no websites which use Java can work....and I believe this is on all Android devices.  Also, no Flash for Android???? Google needs to get it`s act together on this one, and either do the development or get the other developers to do it.  All webpages should be functional on mobile devices. So down to 4 stars...not Samsung`s fault entirely, but I`m looking at the whole experience here.Finally, I bought this tab as a mobile alternative to my laptop for light processing, i.e. working on documents, some light graphic editing etc.  The tools available range from ok to really good, but Office replacements are limited in their functionality.  Hopefully as tabs get into the realm of faster, better processors and more storage space, developers will get some better MS-Office analogues going.In conclusion, excellent tab with a need for some improvement.  Can`t wait to see the next iteration...PS.  I forgot....it`s gorgeous!  As for the reported squeaky body, I haven`t felt that yet...besides, mine is in a case, so it wouldn`t matter...", "Date": "October 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Functional and pretty", "Author": "Christina M. \"-C\"", "ReviewID": "RNY3C9VLXDGJ5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had my tablet for about a week now and in that time have taken it on a very long road trip where I still needed to be able to take an exam for my grad school.  I am a grad student, pre-medical, and have my own business as a private tutor and this tablet is the answer to my needs.  My students love how easy it is for me to share concepts with them by drawing with the S pen.  At first I didn't love the browser, but after downloading a fully functional Google chrome app my speed was 10 times better and it works great.  The stylus is very handy and it's great that putting your hand down on the tablet does not interfere with your writing.  I've been using the formula to text option on the S note app where I write out the algebra 2 formulas I need to show them and they are instantly and accurately translated to text.Small things that have made the difference for me: when I try to click on something in a web browser it will enlarge the section I was clicking if there were multiple links, allowing me to select the correct one.  The battery life has been great and switching from screen to screen or zooming is very fast.Definitely the right choice for students and android users- my students that I tutor who have ipads are jealous.", "Date": "September 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "The paper killer!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2TISS2RPE2DUQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought (I was longing for a tablet like that for a long time) the Note in an effort to minimize my paper use and better organize my notes. I am working on multiple projects, and having multiple notebooks or using loose paper (for archiving) is a big hassle. The S-Pen works fantastic! The supplied software works great, except one thing: the PDFs produced by S Note are not vector based, i.e., when you zoom they get pixelated. If you care about having vector based PDF output, you can get \"Papyrus\" and/or \"Quill\" from the Android market. Both work awesome for note taking!The battery holds up very well, I was using it pretty much constantly between 9am and 4PM and it was only down to 50%. It is very fast and smooth. The only that bothers me a little, is the custom charging cable that needs its own power supply (no computer charge).Edit: it turns out that the note does charge on any USB charger despite the red x that might appear. Keep in mind that this is a very slow charge and if you are doing something intensive on the tablet it  may not charge at all. At least is better than nothing.", "Date": "August 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Bit of a Mixed Bag", "Author": "James Buchanan", "ReviewID": "R11ZGOF9GXI6AG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought my Note 10.1 about three weeks ago (not from Amazon), and this is what I have found.I was attracted to the Note 10.1 because of the split screen option, which allows two or more programs to be run, used, and viewed simultaneously, and because of the active pen.  I envisioned having a pdf textbook open in Polaris Office on half of the screen while taking notes/ solving math/physics problems in the S-note program on the other half of the screen, all while lying on my back on the couch with the tablet propped on my chest.  Well, I have been able to use it effectively in this manner, but I have found that the S-pen is rather tricky to use and takes some getting used to.The S-pen:The first thing I noticed when trying to write with the s-pen out of the box is that I had to press too hard on the screen to make it write.  So I went on line and discovered that the pen's sensitivity can be adjusted by popping off the pen's button and adjusting the potentiometer which is located underneath the button.  However, the potentiometer was very sensitive and at first I over adjusted so that the pen was writing on the screen when it wasn't even touching the glass.  Through trial and error, I was able to get the setting to where I wanted it.Next, I discovered that writing with the pen is very different, and considerably more difficult, than writing with a pen on paper.  The screen is slippery, so more control over pen movement is required than when writing on paper.  Also, there is a gap between the surface of the glass (where the pen tip touches), and the screen below the glass where the image appears.  Thus, unless you are looking directly at a right angle to where the pen is touching the glass, the image on the screen does not appear where you expect it to appear.  Also, there is a slight lag time between the pen motion and the appearance of the image on the screen.  It's only a fraction of a second, but it's enough to mess up the normal feed-back mechanism in your brain that allows you to control your writing.  Lastly, even with touch input turned off, so only the pen will write on the page, the motion of the side of your hand on the screen will occasionally cause the page to move around or inadvertently zoom in or out.These problems were enough to cause me to consider returning the tablet when I first tried it.  However, while using it for a few days, I was able to adjust my writing style to accommodate the pen's quirks, and I can now write with it at an acceptable level of ease and legibility.  It's not as easy or as neat as writing with a pen on paper, and small, intricate math symbols can be difficult to form, but overall it works.The tablet is advertised as being appropriate for graphic artists.  I'm not artistic, but I can't imagine being able to exert the sort of control that is required to draw with this thing.  I would also mention that the pen doesn't produce different line weights in response to pressure in the s-note program.  This function only seems to work in the sketching program.  It is supposed to be capable of producing somewhere in the vicinity of a thousand different line weights, but when experimenting with the sketch program, I could only produce a few different discernible line weights.  In the s-note program, you can select a single permanent line weight from a sliding menu of different line weights.The S-note program:There are limited templates offered for the note taking program.  The two I use are the yellow lined paper and the graph paper.  There is no blank, white, template offered. Note that the hand-writing-to-text and hand-writing-to-formula utilities aren't offered in the graph paper template for some unknown reason.  In the yellow lined paper template, they don't work very well.  I found that I have to write very carefully and legibly (which is difficult with the s-pen) for the hand-writing-to-text function to work, and once the text has been inserted into the note, it is difficult to edit.  The hand-writing-to-formula function is pretty much worthless.  While it is capable of converting some very advanced symbols, such as those used in general relativity, you have to be so very meticulously careful in forming the symbols for it to convert properly that it just isn't worth the effort.  Also, there is no way to edit the formulas once they have been converted and inserted into the note.  The Wolfram-alpha formula solving function, which works with the Wolfram website via the wifi connection to solve formulas you enter, works ok for simple formulas, for which it will solve the equation and produce a graph, but for any thing that is slightly complicated, like a second order differential equation, it just grinds away endlessly without producing a result.Multi-window:The ability of the Note 10.1 to run multiple apps simultaneously and display them side-by-side on the screen in their own windows is the high light of the device in my opinion.  It will automatically tile two windows side-by-side, and you can adjust the proportion of the screen that each inhabits.  Or, you can detach them and move them around, adjust their size, and have a third app running in another window in the background as well.  Switching from one window to another merely requires a tap on the window you want to work in.  Unfortunately, only selected apps will work in the multi-window system.  All the ones I use can be tiled - Polaris office, s-note, the internet browser, the video player, and email.  Polaris office, however, is not ideal for pdf viewing since it will not allow you to annotate pdfs, you can't book mark pages, and it doesn't seem to remember your place in a document consistently.  I am also disappointed that you can't shrink windows down to a single bar at the bottom of the screen like you can in Microsoft Windows for PC. Instead, if you want to make a window disappear from the screen, you have to close the app appearing in the window.  When you reopen the app, it will come back up in the window on the same place on the screen, but the document you had open previously (in the case of Polaris) will have to be reopened.Screen:This is, of course, a standard 1280x800 resolution screen.  I haven't seen one of the high resolution screens that similarly priced competitors have, like the Asus transformer infinity, so I can't compare them.  However, I will say that I have no problem reading small text on internet pages or on pdf files. Occasionally, I have to zoom in on a mathematical symbol to be able to read it clearly.  And text does appear slightly blurry around the edges.  I am guessing, from reading comparative reviews of the ASus transformer infinity, that these things would not occur on a high resolution screen.  Having said that, however, I don't have any problem reading on the note 10.1's screen, and think that it really looks quite nice.  It is bright and colors are vibrant.  Pictures look well defined and clear.  Videos, on the other hand, are a different matter.  Animated features and movies with brightly lit scenes are ok.  But movies with dark scenes, which seems to be most movies these days, are difficult to see except in a completely darkened room (all the lights off).  Also, when  viewing dark  movie scenes, the screen appears washed out around the edges, with the upper left corner appearing orangeish, the lower right corner appearing bluish, and a whitish fringe appearing all around the edges.  Not good.  When using the tablet outdoors in bright sunlight, I find that the screen is bright enough to read text comfortably providing it is positioned properly with respect to the sun.  With the sun shining directly on the screen, I can read it fine.  With the screen facing away from the sun, however, reflections of myself and the scenery behind me dominate the screen and make it difficult to read the text.  Forget about viewing pictures or movies in broad daylight - the screen is not nearly bright enough.Processor speed:It takes just a few seconds to start an app and load a file, even when running multiple programs.  Saving a file also takes just a few seconds.  Scrolling thru pages of a pdf file is quick and continuous, though there is a slight jerkiness.  Not enough to slow you down, just enough to be visually noticeable.  Boot up and shut down takes about 30 seconds, but there is really no need to do this - you can simply shut the unit down in the sleep mode, in which case it instantly turns off and on.  In the sleep mode, it uses practically no power at all.  If it had 75% of battery remaining when you put it in sleep mode in the evening, it will still have 75% remaining when you turn it on in the morning.  The unit will crash only once in a while - about once a week for regular usage.Wifi:The wifi has longer range than my laptop.  Web pages loading time is fast but not nearly as fast as my laptop.  Weather.com home page takes about 5 seconds to load, Amazon.com home page takes about 15 seconds to fully load.Battery:I timed various usages with a chronometer and this is what I found:1) 1-1/2 hour of video at 100% brightness, 1 hour of internet with wifi on, the rest of the time using polaris office and s-note side-by-side at 60% brightness, power saving mode off - battery only lasted 6-1/2 hours.  Definitely not good.2) Continual looping the movie \"Immortals\" at 50% brightness, power save mode on - battery lasted 9 hours. Not bad.3) Same usage as entry 1) above, except at 30% brightness, power save mode on - battery lasted 10 hours. Pretty good.Thus, as you can see, the battery life seems to depend heavily on how brightly the screen is set.  The screen set at 30% brightness as in entry 3) above was comfortably readable in a poorly lit room.Recharge time - for a completely depleted battery (which registers as 5% left), it took 4-1/2 hours to recharge to 100%.Build Quality:As other reviewers have noted, the note 10.1 does have a bit of a cheap feel to it.  The plastic back does flex a little under your hands, and there is a creaking noise when you push down on the edges of the screen, or apply a slight twisting motion to the tablet.  Other than that, it seems to be put together tightly, and it looks fine, it's just not as good as you would expect from a high end tablet.  However, I keep mine in the Samsung case (sold separately), so the build deficits aren't noticeable.Speakers:Placing stereo speakers at opposite edges of the screen facing forward is a great idea, except the speakers aren't loud enough and have a tinny sound.  I find myself having to use headphones when watching videos.  Also, you have to cover up the speakers with tape when you are spraying down the screen with glass cleaning fluid to keep from getting the fluid in the speakers.Price:Too high.  I payed $550 for mine.  It has since dropped to $500.  That's still $100 higher than the Asus transformer infinity.Final Verdict:Despite my criticisms, I find that I use my note 10.1 quite a bit, including the s-pen, and I'm not unhappy with it.  And, of course, if you need a tablet with an interactive pen and multi-windows capability, it's the only game in town.  I'ld say that if I had to do it again, I would have waited a few more months to see if the price came down.  If it came down to $400 or less, I'ld buy it.  For $500,probably not.  If you don't have a need for the pen or windows, you might be better off with the Asus transformer infinity, which has a high resolution screen, super bright screen, aluminum housing, and costs $100 less.  If you do need a tablet with the pen and windows, and are willing to put up with the pen's deficiencies, you might like the note 10.1, but I'ld wait for the price to come down.", "Date": "March 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "I honestly have nothing bad to say about this", "Author": "Tina Vuotto", "ReviewID": "R36J375T47V6GX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought mine 5 months ago, and I was waiting to review it once I used it for a while to give a good review, but after 5 months I still have no cons.Battery life - even if you use it a lot, it lasts longer than my current phone. I have used it at school all day and still been able to play on it at home without charging. If you don't use it very much I have gone 5 days on one charge. (I have nothing on Push settings or the brightness us too high though). I typically charge every night and by the end of the day still have at least 10% and I use it a lot.Durability - I have not dropped it on the ground but I bring it everywhere with me in my bookbag where books and pencil bags knock into it and nothing has happened. Only scratch is the one it was shipped with (it was a refurbished model I bought and the scratch was only noticeable to me because I scoured it, when I asked everyone else no one found it until I pointed it out) I do have a cheap case on it too.Usefulness - I could go on for HOURS talking about how useful it is. The S note can record sound and record writing as you are taking notes. PERFECT for any college student or business person in a meeting. You can scroll through the sound clips after you save to find exactly what you are looking for. The multi-screen thing is BRILLANT! I can't even help but cap-lock on these things, I love this product so much. I used the multi screen for up to 4 things and it still ran fast. I opened everything I could open to test it and it still ran fast (that ran obviously a little slower than usually but still everything was so fast it surprised me I expected it to crash). I think it was like 20 things open with my Chrome having at least 15 tabs inside and it was still functional. Photoshop App that comes with it, totally rocks. You have the best features on the go and the stylus works so well with it. There is a mode that detects your eyes so when you watch a movie, it won't just turn off on you. This also helped while reading textbooks and taking notes because sometimes if you have it to auto turn off too soon it would have turned off by that but it notices your eyes with the front camera.I can't even go into detail about everything, but it is the best tablet on the market if you need it for art or school. Hands down. I saved up so long and I am so happy with it. Everything was taken into account on this tablet, so many small details that you just discover and think wow. The first 3 weeks I learned something more useful every day. There is a auto block feature so your emails won't come through when your sleeping. You can change the standard font. When you are asked in a app how do you want to view this picture (for example it happens differently too) you can click on the gallery and when the app leaves the page it is like the powerpoint slide shows it skews the bottom and scrolls off the page, so fricking cute! So the Jellybean and Note together work so well. Everyone in my family has Ipads, and every single person is jealous of this. I love it. I am always recommending it to everyone. If you have doubt go to a store and try it in stores (that is what I did) and you can see how you like it.Also there is an aftermarket pen that is useful and more comfortable than the small stylus if you have bigger hands that still has pressure sensitivity.", "Date": "May 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great productivity tool for students", "Author": "Robert A.

Samsung's strength lies in its collaboration with other leading companies such as Wacom (S pen), Wolfram Alpha (Formula Match), Adobe (PS Touch) and Dropbox (50 GB storage space for 2 years). It is very smart of Samsung to target the education sector with its productivity features. Now that Steve Jobs was gone, Apple seems to lack imagination and vision, expecting customers to upgrade their iPads on the virtue of \"retina\" display! Give me a break!

You can see the quick study I did of \"Flaming June\" by Leighton on my user profile as my user photo (Sketchbook Pro app was used)I've been looking for a tablet to use while away from my desktop machine for sketching and jotting down ideas.  I've been carrying around a sketchbook and pencil forever, but it's frustrating to only be able to work in shades of gray (who wants to cart around a case of colored pencils or pastels to all places?) as well as having to scan and re-touch the scans of any sketches I make.The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 is what I ended up upgrading from a Nook Color.  It's fantastic!  Wacom penabled, the S Pen has \"good enough\" pressure sensitivity (probably on par with a Bamboo based on my own subjective feel/use) and is also great for note taking.  While S Note does a good job of OCRing handwritten text, I actually prefer saving documents in my own handwriting + diagrams.  No more struggling with a laptop to take notes especially when you REALLY want to circle, underline, change the color of, or otherwise add arrows, stars, hearts etc to your writing.Is it as good as the latest Wacom Intuos tablet?  Of course not.  You could buy a large version of one of those for the same price as this tablet.  But it *is good enough* for a daily-driver for sketching/doodling or even retouching images you've created on your desktop+wacom intuos combo.  I've done sketches on this tablet that I've synced to my desktop to finish up there at my leisure.I have not run into any lag issues (where the line you are drawing takes a while to render, or doesn't render correctly because the cpu is chugging to keep up) using Sketchbook Pro and LayerPaint, but I also do not make big sweeping motions on this tablet as I do on my Wacom large tablet + desktop.  You may notice a little lag with *very* large brush sizes.The S Pen comes with a nib remover (metal circle) and extra nibs (default rubber tips + hard plastic white nibs).  I would recommend using the rubber nibbed for better traction if you're using a naked screen.  With a clear screen protector, I prefer the plastic nibs for next-to-no drag.  People who prefer a texture more similar to paper when writing or drawing may want to apply a matte screen protector.People can quibble about the (relatively) low resolution of the 10.1\" screen (1280x800) not being as high as other HD+ tablets.  Yes, you will notice the lower ppi if you look closely (~ half a foot away) at small text, but unless you're into pixel-peeping 90% of the time, you won't notice.  Colors are bright, text is crisp when viewed like you would normally, and 720p (HD) videos look fantastic.  Sure, you won't get the super-high 1080p clarity you might get with a different higher-res tablet, but who wants to waste SD card space on a video twice the size for a display that's not even close to a desktop monitor in size?  Save the 1080p videos for your large widescreen tvs.Plays MKVs natively, which is nice -- no more converting to mp4 because the default player supports container-type formats.The twin speakers are okay. The stereo effect works well (e.g., the old \"car moving from one end of the screen to the other\" surround-sound effect) but the volume could be louder --- at max, there can be some distortion and you'd have a hard time hearing people speaking clearly at anything lower than mid-volume with any normal ambient noise in the room.Build-wise, mine looks pretty sturdy.  I can hear a little creaking in certain parts of the back when pressed firmly on, which is not entirely unexpected since it's plastic.  Thinner and lighter than my old iPad 2, I prefer keeping it in a case to avoid any issues with dropping/dinging it.In terms of peripherals - You can use up to a 64GB micro SD card with this tablet, which is one of the reasons I went with the 16GB instead of 32GB version (check the price difference between the extra GB edition vs microSD pricing).  Not very much yet out there in terms of other accessories, Samsung's previewed a keyboard dock, OTG hub (so you can plug in USB keyboards etc) and a slim magnetic case but it's hard to find them in stock.With regards to using a case, I heard people having issues with strong magnets affecting S pen tracking, so I would recommend not using a magnetic case if you're very particular about how the S Pen functions (e.g., wanting to do a lot of fine detailed digital work)In terms of negatives, mostly software-related:- Samsung's proprietary UI and apps.  Android OS fragmentation aside, I was eyeballing the Nexus 10 before purchasing the Note because I hate most android mods.  This one is no exception.  You cannot delete any apps that come with the tablet unless you decide to root the tablet.  Rooting the tablet, aside from the obvious warranty implications, can also affect DRM-sensing apps from working properly.  I really wish Samsung would let its users decide on whether or not they want apps like Crayon Physics, S Suggest, and Dropbox to remain on their tablet.- Apps can only install on default memory*.  You cannot use Apps2SD, for example, to move apps from the Note's built-in memory to an external SD card without *rooting the device.  While you get 16GB, this can get annoying if you are an app glutton (especially with app waistlines expanding to upwards of 50MB per app or more) or use apps that don't give you the option of saving files to the external SD card.- Proprietary 30-pin cable and non-removable battery.  The first is annoying but you can buy $6 cables on Amazon as extras (the one that comes with the charging hub is *extremely* short, ~3 feet at most) that work just fine.  If you attempt to charge this tablet via your computer, the tablet will show the battery icon as not charging.  In some cases (depending on the amount of juice it gets from the USB port) it will actually charge, but so slowly that it's practically useless.  The non-removable battery is annoying simply because batteries for these mobile devices just don't last more than a couple of years before losing charging capacity.- Slow OS updating.  Samsung has rolled out Jellybean (which is, from my experience on a rooted Nook Color, a massive upgrade in terms of responsiveness and general UI improvement over Ice Cream Sandwich) updates to other regions but has yet to update US/Canada versions of this tablet (N8013 model).  Not a big issue since the tablet is very responsive even while multi-windowing, but if you absolutely have to have Jellybean the only way to get it on a US model Note right now is by rooting/romming it.Conclusion:Would I have bought this tablet if I didn't need/want the Wacom penabled S Pen?  Probably not, since other tablets out there have nicer screens (ipad with retina display, nexus 10 with high ppi also).  The Nexus 10 was next on my list because of the nice screen plus un-modified Android UI/OS/more regular updates.  I use a moderate selection of apps and am a light tablet gamer.  This has handled 3D games beautifully (see any youtube reviews) because of the powerful processor. I also read a lot, and while the 10.1\" format is a bit clunky for e-reading compared to my 7\" Nook Color (the large size makes it more awkward to hold even though it's actually lighter), it's adequate for the purpose.However, that's the beauty of android tablets -- there's sizes and types for everyone.  I would not, for example, recommend the same tablet for my mom as I would for myself --- it depends on how you want to use it.  Would you buy a Porsche for delivering newspapers?  The same basic idea goes for tablets.For digital art work, there's currently nothing on the market right now that can match this without additional purchases (e.g. the Adonit Jot BT pen for iPad).  When the Surface Pro comes out, those who want full-fledged applications such as Photoshop may want to go that route, but they'll sacrifice for the power with a much smaller battery life. As far as iOS vs. Android, it's your own very personal platform preference -- apples to oranges and I would highly recommend trying out both types of tablets at your local brick-and-mortar if you can't decide which type to get.", "Date": "January 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "The only choice for a professional!

I bought the Samsung Galaxy Tab (the first model) when it first came out about a year or 2 ago and I was extremely disappointed.  It was slow, it lagged.  I was done. I was done with android products. I returned it shortly after I bought it.  I went on to buy an iphone 4s and fell in love with the apple system. It was smooth.  It didnt randomly crash. It was great.  I decided to buy a new tablet to do school work on and watch lectures on without having a huge bulky laptop in my bed or at the coffee shop.  Worrying about cords, etc.  I thought about going with the ipad, but I've struggled with them not supporting all of the video feeds I receive from my online courses.  (flash, blackboard, etc).  You also cannot customize your screens.  All you can do is line up the apps in the order you wish and change the background.  Although the new ipad is pretty and shinny, it lacks a lot of features that the Galaxy Note 10.1 has.  First off, I must say Samsung has come a LONG way within the past few years. They really stepped their game up.  I LOVE the pen. It is the best I have ever seen.  The tip has a more defined point as opposed to the old eraser head.  I love that I can open and edit word documents by free writing on the document (without it looking like I let a kindergartener grade my papers), or I can insert text boxes and include text.  I can also highlight documents. I can edit word documents and presentations.  It comes with POLARIS OFFICE pre installed for FREE! It has S Note which is a really cool app that lets you take notes and transform your hand writing to text.  Visually, the screen is beautiful and very appealing.  Although the ipad is just a tad more fluid when scrolling or sliding through apps, there isn't a huge difference.All in all I chose this over the ipad. I feel that the ipad is just a bigger version of my phone.  The tablet is a really nice change and I love love love it. Very happy with my purchase as a student and a mother who lets her 15 month old son watch Netflix on her tablet.

The SGN 10.1 is my second tablet, the first being the original Kindle Fire. Sorry Amazon, I really enjoyed my Fire, but there were too many \"cons\" on my list to consider purchasing the new Kindle Fire HD.When researching my new tablet, I looked at all available options.  I decided I really did want the larger screen, so it boiled down to choosing the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 or SGN 10.1.  What really sold me on the Note was the hardware: 1.4 GHz QUAD-core processor and 2GB of RAM. I have a need for speed and thought the additional expense would be worth it. I wasn't really concerned with the S Pen at all, but now that I've had a chance to play with it, I can see how I will use it frequently. The micro-SD expansion slot and volume control buttons were also very important to me. And, I am looking forward to taking my first road trip and using the GPS.This tablet is super fast. Several pre-loaded apps have the ability to multi-task and the tablet doesn't slow down when doing so. Wi-fi is incredibly strong in areas of my home where other devices have weak signals. There's a great selection of apps optimized for tablets from Google Play, Amazon App Store, and Samsung Apps. The front 5MP camera (with LED flash!) takes decent photos and videos, especially for social networking apps like Instagram & Twitter. I haven't used the front facing camera for video calls yet. The Peer IR remote easily synced with my Sony TV and Brighthouse cable box. I have read other reviews of people complaining about the screen resolution. I really don't understand.  The screen is bright and the colors are vibrant. Pictures and videos are stunning. And from what I understand, the lower (comparatively speaking) resolution helps save battery consumption.The only disappointment I have so far is the proprietary charge/data cable.  I wish it had a micro-usb port.So if you have the cash in your budget, I highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1!", "Date": "October 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Just Great compared to new IPAD", "Author": "AJ", "ReviewID": "RNWJIASVQ07SQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My oldest son got an IPad and our family was on it all the time.

I truelly believe it is far superior than the new Ipad.  Yes the \"retina display\" and apps are great but as far as functionality and browser set up, the Note is leaps and bounds.The complaints I have against the Ipad is that I don't like the single back button that brings you home.  I always found myself having to retrace steps if I wanted to go back to something else.  With the Note I like having the true back button and the ability to quickly go back to other processes with the task manager.  The browser capabilities are very similar to my laptop and I find myself on my wifes Note more than the Ipad (which I we only use for games).I would strongly recommend the Note to anyone looking to get a great tablet that is used to non-Apple mobile and standard computing, i.e. Andriod, microsoft, blackberry.

I also had the Fujitsu Q550 but sold it.  My wife has an Ipad and I also have a Nexus 7.The Wacom  stylus makes a huge difference compared to the N-trig on the Lenovo.

If you invoke the power saving mode the usage is even longer.The software is pretty much standard Samsung fare but the S-Note is a nice program but rather simplistic.  If you buy this you should immediately go the Play Market and buy Lecture Notes, Lecture Notes Recorder and install the pdf plugin.  You can sync audio and written notes and replicate about 50% of the functionality of OneNote.  No other program comes close to offering the features of OneNote except Lecture Notes.

Then the 10.1 Note came out and not only did I buy this I also bought my wife the tab 2 10.1. She uses hers every day too. I am a photographer and use Photoshop  a lot. When I played with this tab in the store and found Photoshop Touch on it along with a quad core and 2 gig of ram, I had to have it. Can you tell I like Samsung? I've tried everything else and they all fell short of what I expected. I love the Touch Wiz that others complain about because it offers what I need. I've tried the other apps that are similar to the Touch Wiz but they fall way short. Launchers to replace it don't hold a candle to it. From icons being too small to spacing between them too far apart. Touch Wiz works well and on this tab, its perfect. My wife just bought the S3 phone and when she walks into the house with pictures she took of the grand kids, the automatically go to my Note. To browse or to edit in Photoshop Touch.

Not only it is stereo, it is facing you, and it has plenty of volume to enjoy.The thing that bothered me the most about the iPad2's speaker was that, not only is it mono, it is located on the back.It bothered me to the point of searching and backing some \"Kickstarter\" project, so that I could redirect the sound from back to front.I was that desperate..S-PEN:S-Pen and PS Touch experience has been just amazing.It is not perfect, but it made it possible where it was impossible before.I could actual do semi-serious photoshopping with it.The S-Pen is pin-point accurate and the PS touch provided good set of tools, complete with good tutorials to acquaint myself.I hope one day, that I can work with RAW image files on this combo.MINI APPS:Some people think there aren't enough mini apps available. True, but I like to think in reverse.Having them and not having them make a quite the difference in my opinion.They are very handy, because they are popup apps that hovers over other app and can be moved around.It is nice to clip things and take notes on them, without needing to hop and switch from one app to the other.The whole process flows very well and naturally.PERFORMANCE (GAME):I think you will find plenty of youtube videos, demonstrating how well it can run some of the most heavy (CPU)hitting titles.My gaming experience has been the same. This tablet will chew up those games like it was designed to be a gaming machine, and it can be and it is.As of 8/30/2012, this tablet is the only tablet that I know that sports 2GB of memory.Along with 1.4Ghz quad core Exynos processor, it packs some serious performance.PERFORMANCE (MULTITASK):This is where that 2GB of memory shines.If the internal storage space and micro SD card are the filing cabinets, the system memory is the desk.Bigger the memory, bigger the surface area of the desk, where you can open more documents and lay them down, side by side.Since it has such a spacious(2GB) desk, it does not need to close already open documents to make room for new document to open.Every time your device closes the document or app just to reopen them again later from scratch, it occupies that much more processor time and eats that much more battery power processing it.Along with split-screen capability and pop up mini apps, multitasking on this tablet is A+.BATTERY LIFE:I do not always play games, or watch videos, but I do fair amount of them, and I am comfortable to say that I get 10+ hours, which is healthy amount. Charging time is around 3 hours if I let it go down to about 20%~30%.BUILT QUALITY:It could be better. So does the iPad in difference aspects.However, it will get the job done of protecting it.Just don't drop it, hard.Then again, it is a fair game for other tablets too.If you drop them hard, most of them will break just the same.REMINDER:I have couple of reminders.1st one is about the hidden goodies in Galaxy Note 10.1.There are many small details and features that you probably do not know about.While they are not a game changer, they certainly make the tablet experience that much richer.Some of the things you want to look into are.. Display Screen modes (Dynamic, Standard & Movie), Motion features (Tilt to zoom, Pan to move icon & Pan to browse images), two fingers pinch in sweep over your on screen keyboard to change mode (Qwerty keyboard, Floating & Split), in Floating keyboard mode, if you touch the keyboard with two fingers for about 2 secs, you can relocate the keyboard to any area on the screen. There are many other hidden goodies, so google for tips and tricks.2nd one is about Jelly Bean update.Samsung is preparing for the Jelly Bean update.When that happens, you will get the latest Android OS, BUT you will lose the Adobe Flash Player.Adobe Dev. no longer supports Adobe Flash player for mobile version, so if you value your flash capability.. then ***DO NOT*** upgrade it to JB.Remain on ICS until HTML5 becomes majority.

I am posting it since I hope it will help others with my particular focus.  The only reason I purchased this tablet was to be able to use it to digitally draw and paint.  If you think about it, spending 550 dollars on something that is really nothing more than a digital sketchbook is nuts considering a regular paper sketchbook works just as well.  However, I do not need to carry markers, paint or other crap with me to draw and I can use this in the dark sitting outside by a fire or whatever.  Originally, I was going to plunk down 1300 dollars for the Samsung Series 7 slate which is absolutely awesome (there is NOTHING better for the digital artist currently)but I just could not justify the cost.On to the review.  Since I was focused strictly on digital drawing and painting, the stylus use and sensitivity were important.  I currently own a Cintiq 21UX and a Wacum Intuos 4 wireless tablet and I love the Cintiq with how sensitive it is and how it responds with digital painting.  I held off buying any slates up to this point since other artist told me that I would be disappointed in the sensitivity and ability for detail using an apple or other droid devise with a capacitive stylus.  Of course, I know some nice stuff has been created using these tablets, even with fingers, but I was not at all interested in that effort.I received the tablet and and immediately purchased and downloaded Sketchbook Pro, one of my favorite apps.  I checked all of the settings to make sure the pen was set up and then I started to draw.  I would love to say it was love at first site but I was a bit disappointed.  The stylus does respond pretty good and the painting experience is good but it seems to falter a bit with detail or smaller lines.  It will skip sometimes and you have to go back and redo the stroke or brush mark.  Sketchbook pro does work well on this tablet and the program has a lot of nice features but this review is not about Sketchbook.Other things I noticed is that it does not have an eraser ( I knew this when I bought it)which could be pretty handy but it is not necessary.  I do like how the stylus fits into a dedicated hole on the slate.  The screen resolution and brightness seems fine but an HD screen would be very, very nice.General comments on the slate itself.  I have read about the plastic back and although it does not really bother me, I do find myself handling this thing cautiously.  I think it will be fine but Samsung always seems to have some quality issues which some of their great products which I just do not understand.  Again, the back is most likely not an issue but it does kind of feel \"cheap\".  The UI seems okay and pretty responsive so no complaints there.  As for a programs, I do not have much to say there since my focus is really on using this as a drawing tool.  However, I did try to set up the TV remote feature and for some reason it partly worked and then did not work at all.  I will try setting it up again since I think this would be a pretty cool feature. The battery does seem to do well and I had the screen pretty bright and working on a digital sketch for about 2 hours.  I think I was down to 77% or something so battery life should be fine.  It does seem to take a bit of time to charge fully.Is the tablet worth the money?  I don't know...I guess so but I am rarely excited about spending 500 dollars or more on anything really.  I think 375 or 400 dollars for this sort of tablet would be justifiable but what do I know.  I do think if you are considering any slate at all, I would look at this one seriously since it can do everything an Apple or other Droid can do PLUS it has the stylus for note taking and drawing.  I gave it 4 stars because I can draw pretty well with it.  I would give it 5 stars if the stylus worked a bit better with light touches on smaller brush sizes.  I do think this trend of using a stylus will hit it big with artists and students so I am sure something better may come along for the same price in a year or two.  As I mentioned previously, if you want that better slate now, look at the Samsung Series 7 Slate.  Truly an amazing tool if you are okay spending that kind of money.  If you want some of that experience but on a smaller budget, then this is probably the way to go.  I will used this slate I have for awhile and then try to update this review.", "Date": "August 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "As a student, I don't get whats so great", "Author": "Bryan Williams", "ReviewID": "R165ZDW4R7A6F0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After using a note 10.1 for 10 days now for college, I personally don't get it. The multitasking is little more than samsung showing you 2 apps at once; you still can only really do one useful thing at once. If you have a browser open and are downloading something, and have sNotes next to it, when you tap over to sNotes, the browser stops downloading. Why you may ask? Because in reality you just closed your browser, you just don't know it. Then, for the classes I'm taking the apps that do offer the multi-tasking are useless. I need to use the apps for my particular set of classes: Wolfram alpha, real calculator, greys anatomy for example(bioengineering/premed), as well as browsers like firefox, or chrome. Too bad they don't work in multiscreen because this is a samsung hack. It's gonna be a while before they do I suspect.The mini apps at the bottom are also useless in quality and content to me and they are one more thing that gets pressed and opens when I hand my tablet to someone else. If I could put my apps (realcalc or some other graphing calculator) down there then maybe, but really, if I could turn off the mini app option I would. I hate it. Its almost as bad as taking notes and having your ability to write all of a sudden stop because you've activated either the notifications window or the mini apps by accident.Personally, the customization of minute things in the OS are just not interesting to me and I've noticed that many of the settings that my HTC phone offers are just missing all together. However, androids always felt almost done, but not quite done to me any way. However, samsung then come along and really don't help the cause at all.Can any one tell me why I need multiple clocks or weather widgets all telling me the same thing over and over in multiple screens? Apparently, android developers see the need to offer me the ability to tinker with my OS settings multiple times a day. I don't have time for that and want it out of the way.I believe that many of the inadvertent activations of these various screens could have been prevented by putting this bottom Home/MiniApps/Notifications bar at the top of the screen like on many phones. Why put soft buttons where we hold the tablet or rest our palms?I've tried implementing the stylus pen into my math and science class note taking, but really, it just costs me time. if I need to grab a graph of some sort that I've drawn to move in my notes, forget it, it's only grabbing pieces of the drawing at a time. Every time you lift the pen, the tablet considers it a new drawing, instead of letting you choose an area of lines and deciding that everything in such area is your drawing in its entirety. I don't understand why it allows me to type right over the top of annotations I've made, and the write to text is just (for me) unreliable. The terminology is just not in the data base and my corrections would not stick.The hardware sounded great on paper, and for the most part I've had no issues with lag or connections. In walking around in Bestbuy I see more responsive tablets. In the end, I think it was samsung that ruined it for me and I just feel this tablet is a little gimmicky.For the money I expected a better app experience from samsung. I need a few apps that work, not 20 where half of them are crap and the other half half work with one or two stand outs. 18 credit hours this semester and this tablets cost me so much in wasted time I feel like billing samsung. I pull out the ultrabook and blaze through note taking, look up things like graphs and insert them into my notes infinitely better. I save and annotate pdf's just fine and all my school books are through kno.com. Personally, I just think tablets are for light stuff. I need to do more than a few things at once and I need all of my features at the same time.", "Date": "October 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantastic tablet that serves many functions PLUS the S-pen", "Author": "Imaginary Fox \"Kitsune\"", "ReviewID": "R2GA6ZEOUZH32J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My background is I'm on my desktop PC running WinXP and had a old low-end laptop which I no longer have, but had enjoyed the portability with. I got this tablet because I'm an amateur artist and I wanted to get a device that was good to draw on as well as had basic laptop functionality to replace my old one so I'm not as tied to my PC. I do not own any Apple or Android products, so I wasn't tied to either company. This made me favor the Android system, because it was more open.I did a LOT of research on tablets to see what fit my needs best, and I know there are even others that are more like a laptop, with a detachable keyboard, like the Transformer series. This one was as much as I wanted to spend, most of the others that were attractive were also higher-priced (for good reason). Ones like the Surface Pro, while really cool, were out of my price range. The other one I was more seriously looking at was the Nexus 10, but I wanted the better pen experience over the better resolution.One thing I want to make clear about the S-pen is this is the ONLY tablet that currently uses Wacom technology, which is the best for artistic work. Other tablets support a stylus, but they all have a rounded rubber end or a clear plastic disc around the point if it is fine, because the touch technology works differently for those tablets. No other tablet has ACTUAL pressure sensitivity and a normal style of pen.However, the unfortunate drawback of it being an Android tablet is that iPad actually has a couple superb art apps that are not available for Android, which I find ironic :( But that doesn't mean we don't get good apps. The tablet comes with Adobe Touch, but frankly I don't think its the best one, even though its the most expensive on the app store normally. Adobe has sadly pretty much pulled out of the Android market altogether save for this app, and I wouldn't be surprised if it never sees a real update of new features. I feel a lot of bitterness towards Adobe for this. I was going to pick up Ideas even though I knew it was really limited, but it got pulled from the market before I got my tablet. The main reasons I don't recommend Touch are severe limitations in file saving and opening. Other apps can give you .psd support, layers, and S-pen support without as much hassle. Adobe only lets you save files on their Cloud.The most recommended art apps are Sketchbook Pro and Layer Paint which I think weren't more than $3 each. They both seem solid and highly-reviewed but I havn't used them enough to offer a real opinion yet. There are of course a bunch of others, I grabbed ZenBrush to try it out since it was free. I was looking for something that supported layers and I could export to continue to work with in Photoshop CS on my desktop and those two seem to fit the bill.Now that I've got that out of the way, I have to say I love this tablet. I feel like every day it blows my mind how cool it is :D It has replaced everything I can do on my desktop PC save for extensive programs like full Photoshop or large games like Guild Wars 2. Web browsing, art files, documents, light games, music, videos, it does it all. This tablet is great on its own for regular functions, but having the S-pen makes it amazing.I'm looking forward to the Jelly Bean update, because I think this tablet will keep getting better. (The reason Jelly Bean takes longer for this than a Nexus is Samsung does tweaking for support of the S-pen and some other modifications, but it should be hitting really soon.)I honestly hope Samsung keeps this line of tablets going in the future, and while I am happy with how this tablet is, I see some ways they could continue to improve. I look forward to a Note 2 when the time comes, though I don't think it will be soon. I also hope more apps will continue to appear to support the S-pen.So, here's a rundown of some features:I love that it had a micro SD expansion slot. The main thing I didn't like about the Nexus was the lack of memory expansion. This tablet has ample space for my needs after getting a micro SD card. I plugged the tablet into the computer and was able to move my files onto the tablet card as easy as moving them to a flash drive. It just can take a while for a large volume of files. I was able to move over my music, video files, and other docs I wanted access to and still have a good amount of space left.I also already use Dropbox and love it. I already had some extra space unlocked, but getting the huge chunk of free space for 2 years is awesome. This is great for files you want to be able to work on with several devices.I love how customize-able the screens are. I can make whatever mix of widgets and app icons wherever I want (you have 6 full screens you can lay out and swipe between, so I made themed ones- email, news, calendar, games, internet apps, and music/videos). I trashed most of the default layout pretty quickly. Some of the side bars from Samsung aren't that useful, but I just tweak or ignore them and they don't get in my way.So far I've had no problems with the tablet's performance- no crashing or hanging or anything. It runs smoothly and quickly.It finds and connects to wifi easily. Most settings are very quick to access and modify. It also supports Bluetooth.I was very impressed with the battery life. It generally lasts 2 days of pretty heavy use- I've never run out so far. I generally charge it every other day, though other electronics (like my phone) I charge every night.The resolution may not be top of the line, but it looks great to me. I enjoy watching video files (which is supports a god range of) as well as apps like Netflix and Crunchy Roll.Polaris Office comes included and can handle Microsoft documents, so I was able to open whatever I needed! It also supports Adobe Reader for .pdfs.The speakers are good, but I also love that it has a headphone port. I sometimes plug in some computer speakers and listen to music at work through it. The music stays on in the background if you're doing something else with the tablet.I figured out most stuff with the tablet quickly just by poking around, although Samsung for the most part tells you very little other than a brief feature overview booklet. But hey that's what Google is for. I generally just looked up any questions I had. I'd say only folks who aren't comfortable on computers may have some trouble diving in. I found it logical for the most part.The app selection seems very good. You can always browse the Google Play store before buying the tablet to see if what you want is there (although not all apps are supported by all devices- I learned sadly the Popcap games there are not supported for this tablet). It also supports Nook and Kindle (and I'm sure others) so you can shop at other app stores too for your games, music, movies, books, etc, you are not tied just to Google.I think this tablet is a great size for reading, I generally tilt it sideways for browsing the web or reading. It just takes the tablet a second to orient in any direction.I've seen some people complain that the side-by-side feature for running a few select programs is kind of lackluster, and they have a valid point, but I didn't really mind. I read how the feature worked, but it wasn't something I really planning on using much. If this is a reason you're buying this tablet, keep in mind its limited to a handful of programs, and it does take a moment when switching for that program to activate. Its still a good feature if you don't have super high expectations.The camera is adequate, but unimpressive. It seems required for any portable device to have a camera nowadays, and both front and back are there, but the photos aren't great. If I'm taking serious pictures, I'll stick to the digital camera I got. Its about equally as good as a normal cell phone for just taking a quick pic you want to post to Twitter. It has the weaknesses of most regular range digital cameras with low light, indoors, and motion. It does do video too and I can see it being good if you want to video chat on Skype or something. It gets the job done, its just not going to make amazing vacation photos.I believe you can get a Samsung or bluetooth keyboard for this separately, so you can get more of a laptop feel. I am a avid typer (can you tell by the length of my article?), but for typing I was satisfied with using the touch screen. I'd say you probably only need a keyboard attachment if you plan on typing a LOT, for instance writing a book or something and don't want to use the pen.One thing that's been a concern with tablets is the lack of support for Flash. With the number of websites and such that use Flash, I thought it'd be a problem, but so far I havn't even noticed. Most extensive Flash or video sites (like Youtube) have an app to use instead.I'm currently waiting on a case to come- I'd like to keep it in my purse/bag, and while it seems solidly built, I don't want to worry about it rubbing against other things like my keys and getting scratched. I had a hard time deciding on a case, hopefully I picked a good one. I like that some of the cases offer folding options to function as a stand for your tablet, so I think a case is a good addition if you can find one you like. Be aware some do not have a slot cut for the pen!My nitpicks about the tablet would be that its a little heavy to hold freehand over a period of time to read, watch video, or whatnot, but I don't have a problem resting it on my legs or something else. It doesn't get hot like a laptop at all.I also don't feel like the charger fits in the bottom well- it doesn't really click in, you just kinda wiggle and push it in and out. Over time I'm afraid it may have a tendency to get loose.Would I recommend this tablet for everyone? Not universally. You are paying extra for the Wacom screen technology and also sacrificing some resolution, so if you're not in love with the S-pen, then I'd look at other tablets. I don't think this tablet is for your average person who mostly wants some media and internet consumption- there are better tablets if the pen doesn't matter to you.For a purchase like this, I recommend you do what I did- find a local store that has one on display to try. I went to Best Buy several times to poke at this tablet before deciding to buy. I also went to several office stores to try out other tablets. Poke around in S-note, see how you like the feel of the pen (though be aware it may have been abused and not work as well as it should.)Should you get the 16GB or 32GB internal memory? I did some reading and decided on the 16GB since the tablet has space for ample expansion, and you can get a far larger micro SD card for the $50 difference- I got the 64GB SanDisk class 10 one. I popped it in the small port not long after I got the tablet going for the first time and it recognized it no problem. 16+64= 80GB which is likely far more than I'll ever need. The only thing to be aware of is some things will only work or want to go on the internal memory, and like any storage drive, the number is a lie. You actually start with more like 11.6GB free space after the OS and whatnot, and 59.5GB on the card (I'm not sure why about that, I think it may have come with stuff on it). After getting any app that sounded interesting and filling up a chunk of my card with a large part of my music collection and videos, I'm at 9.3GB free on the system, and 30.2GB on my card, so I don't feel like I'm in any danger of running out of either.I've had it a couple weeks at this point so not really had time to test out all the details extensively, so I'll update this review later on.", "Date": "January 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worth it", "Author": "Miriam", "ReviewID": "REBPK101QYWG5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this model because for just $50 more, it doubled the storage from 16gb to 32gb (yes, white is pretty, but it doesn't come in 32gb).Pros:* Multitasking. I love being able to open the browser and email at the same time, as well as a few others. I have an iPad 3 also and it's something it can never do. No more switching from browser to gallery, or gallery to email, etc etc.* Processor is snappy. Quadcore 1.4 GHz is great. I often have multiple apps (up to 10, sometimes more) running at the same time - and no lag. Note: the iPad 3 is only 1GHz processor, and dual core, not quad.* RAM. Fantastic that this has 2 GB RAM Memory, again, you can tell when running intensive, multiple apps, especially gaming. Last note about iPad 3, it benchmarks at only 1gb (and don't gripe with the iPad references if you're an i-fanboy, please :) I do like my iPad, too).* Stylus. There's technology built into it. If you haven't already, go to Youtube and search \"Full Version Video of GALAXY Note 10.1 US Launch\" to see.* SamsungDive.com.* Expandable Storage.* Warranty. 1 year on the tablet + 1 year on the internal battery.Cons - which really aren't Cons to me:* Display. 1280 is beautiful on this device. I watch movies on it all the time and it's VERY sharp, as are games. It's nothing to complain about, trust me.* Price. Yes, it's not the cheapest tablet around. But when you consider the processor, the amount of storage - plus it's expandable, and the RAM, it's well worth the cost to me. The build quality is very good, and most importantly it does everything it says it will do, efficiently, and has some unique apps.. my favorite is Adobe Photoshop Touch.Note: I bought mine direct from the Samsung site, only because I thought it might be easier to return or repair, if ever the case arose.", "Date": "November 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Experiencing a major problem after a week.", "Author": "The NC", "ReviewID": "RBIYXX9JLQES8", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "UPDATE:  9/2/2012-----------------------Based on comments others have left me, it seems my problem was caused by an update that Samsung released over the air(wifi) without me knowing.

The update was pulled, so hopefully no one else will experience this from now on.-------------------------original review below-------------------------I received my Galaxy Note 10.1 last week, and have been playing with it without issue every day since.  This has been a five-star product until...Today, I just tried pulling out the pen and the touch panel seemed to go dead.  Everything on screen is still visible, just no touch function at all with either finger or pen.  Re-inserting the pen re-enables the finger touch functionality.Shutting down the tablet and leaving the pen out, then re-testing pen function after turning it on still has no pen function.Great, THE PEN IS NOW USELESS.I know my way around the Android OS having used my Samsung Vibrant(rooted to ICS) phone for the past two years, and also have used an Archos and an Acer Honeycomb tablet both upgraded to ICS.  With that said, none of the settings in the options are able to bring the pen functionality back.I'm now wondering if it's a magnet issue within the pen.  But I'll need to decide if I want to return this thing for a replacement or deal with Samsung Customer Service which I know will not be fun.*EDIT 8/29/12:  Just adding more after a little more testing.I turned on the tablet today, to try again to see if it would resolve itself.  Same problem still.  But now, I notice that after the tablet enters sleep and waking it up with the power button, the touch panel is dead without even pulling the pen out to cause the dilemma.So I force restart now, and go into options to do a factory reset.  For those that don't know what this does, is that it'll reset the tablet to the condition as if it were coming out new in the box.  I just wanted to try this as a last ditch effort, but still dead touch panel problems.I'm convinced to send it back to Amazon now.

I like the fact that this tablet can convert My chicken scratch into text as quickly as I can write it down. I've had this tablet for 2 months so I've had plenty of time to explore it inside out.I've read other reviews that complained about the screen resolution. I'm a graphic artist and it is perfect for me. I've played with the updated 2014 version and while the display is brighter, and the interface is almost identical to the Note 3 (which I also own), this version is still a solid tablet, especially with the new lower price tag. So if you want to save a couple hundred dollars I would not count this tablet out.The S pen is VERY Useful to me. It feels comfortable in my hand and is very responsive. I prefer its position at the bottom of the tablet to the upper right corner where the 2014 version has placed it. The s pen interface for this tablet is like the one Used in the Note 2. So if you own or have owned that phone, it will be very familiar to you.The multi screen feature is ok, but I do prefer the 2014's updates which allows more programs. I have had several windows open at one time and noticed no visible lag. You can also resize the windows and move them around.Touch Wiz is on top of Android and Works Seamlessly with it.

Samsung gives you Kies which lets you transfer all your music to the tablet easily.  Also, with their mini-sd drive (I bought the SD 64 gb card) you can put music on there if you didn't want to use Kies.  Kies is great and works just as well with photos.  2. Videos were impossible.  The way digital copies transfer to play in ITunes makes it hard to watch on your tablet.  You would need to download and/or pay to convert your files to a readable format.  Luckily, we also have a pc with a windows os so we were able to re download digital copies (from blu-rays) and download an app on the tablet to be able to play videos. So, if you have windows, it will be easy to transfer your videos to the tablet.  The ones that expired I have not converted yet and do not plan on it as I do not need that many movies on the tablet but it was annoying.

This is my first tablet, and as such I did much research to figure out which one would suit my needs and wants the best.Let me start off by saying that the only real worry I had about the tablet was the screen resolution.  I had watched and read many reviews and comparisons and the main concern that always came up was the resolution was not that great.  I have to say that even though it is only 1200x800, it's still VERY beautiful to me.  You will notice a difference if you've used a new iPad or one of the higher end new Android tablets, I'm sure... but the screen isn't as bad as many make it out to be.  It's very overstated.  The other thing that concerned me, not really Samsung's fault, was the fact that Android tablets have few apps that are specifically designed for them.  This is still bothersome as apps like Facebook, twitter, and games all have a smartphone feel.  It's something to consider, but for me it wasn't a deal breaker.I purchased the white version of the tablet, and it looks beautiful.  The first thing that stuck out to me were the speakers being in the front, rather than the rear.  This was genius by Samsung, and I bet future tablet makers will follow this trend.  Unless Samsung patents the idea, and says no... which would be quite awesome!  Anyway, I digress.  Beyond the speakers, the tablet is light and plastic.  The feel is nice, but I bought a case due to using it for school.The actual software is now updated to Jellybean, which is great.  The tablet is fast as heck.  I run games, movies, internet browsing, and s-notes all without any issues.  It's lightning quick.  The keyboard is wonderful.  Even better though, and a major reason I decided on this tablet, is the S-pen.  This is what separates this tablet from every other.  The S-pen combined with pressure sensitivity and palm rejection is a dream come true.  I will be using this tablet as my notebook when I return to class.

I can also set up a VPN or even have it connect to my archive server, sync, and create a backup.  From a non-technical stand point, it is very user friendly and can keep you connected with any social media.  It also has IR that can turn your tablet into a remote for your TV.

Some reviews I read (or watched) complained that the fact that the back is plastic made the Note 10.1 feel cheap to them. Maybe I'm not as discerning, but I'm thrilled with the build quality of the Note 10.1. It's very thin, very light, but also very solid feeling. It doesn't look or feel at all \"cheap\" to me.Other reviewers (users and \"experts\") also talked about the screen and the fact that it's only HD (720p) not Full HD (1080p). Regardless, the screen of the Note 10.1 is gorgeous to my eyes with excellent viewing angles, vivid colors, and fantastic contrast. You'll only notice the 720p resolution when reading books or text--and then only if you look closely. It's still totally satisfactory and not at all annoying to me. One thing about the 720p: the lower resolution is probably at least in part intentional because it requires less power to push the reduced number of pixels, and therefore the device can run more smoothly for longer than it would if it had the higher resolution screen.In any case, the Note 10.1 runs very fluidly with gorgeous graphic transitions between screen, loading everything with aplomb and speed. This is one very fast machine. On that note, make sure that you delete the built-in Samsung widgets which are installed on most of the screens initially. Doing so dramatically speeds up the interface, and you won't miss Samsung's *other* products (i.e., everything but S Note).My personal concern was as a student I worried about the stylus functionality. I worried that perhaps hand writing would lag too much--i.e., show up on the screen after I'd already finished drawing a character of a word. I haven't been able to find many videos showing how well the handwriting works. And no the videos on youtube showing the handwriting recognition don't help me because I don't every use handwriting recognition. I just want a tablet that keeps up with my handwriting and renders it well on the virtual page. The Note 10.1 does so. It captures my handwriting in exactly the way I want it captured--it looks, in other words, similar to how it looks on paper. It's chicken-scratch on a paper page, and it's still chicken-scratch on the virtual page in the Note 10.1, but that's what I want. And yes, it totally keeps up with my rapid writing and drawing. In every way the note taking experience on this machine is totally satisfactory. I'm also looking forward to reading and annotating pdfs on this device. The screen dimensions are optimal for viewing, reading, and writing--and doing all three on the go.Seriously. If you're on the fence as I was, get off! This *is* the device you want. It can do everything the iPad can do, and more. Not only can you consume all the media and play all the games that you can on the iPad, on this device you can also create media (i.e., take notes, annotate documents, etc.). While the Microsoft Surface isn't out yet, as I hear it the Surface RT (the entry-level model) fails to offer palm-rejection. This is a major oversight as you pretty much need solid palm rejection to support using a tablet for notetaking and writing. The Note 10.1 is excellent in this category as well. I was able to rest my palm on it and scrawl away without issue. Awesome.Samsung really hit it out of the park on this one. I highly recommend the Note 10.1.[UPDATE 12/1/12]I've been using the Note 10.1 for over a month now and have more to add to my initial review. I still really like the Note 10.1 but as the newness wears off, so does some of the infatuation. It is still the best device in its class (tablet with a stylus for a relatively affordable price), but it's not perfect. The back of the case wears a little quicker than I'd like and the inking experience, while good, could be just a tad bit better. I hear the inking experience is supposed to be improved by the upcoming Jelly Bean update which I hear will arrive in the next month. We'll see. I'll update my review later after that update to let y'all know what I observe. The inking is certainly good enough to be effective for notetaking in class or meetings or using as an infinite notepad on your desk at work. It's just little things that I've noticed: the ink having a tad bit of lag as it \"flows\" onto the screen as you write. The device will be just the slightest millisecond behind your movements...not really enough to matter, but just enough to notice it. Also, I'm not certain if it's the app I'm using (LectureNotes--very good) or the device, but occasionally the accuracy of the pen can be quirky. A letter I've just written might have a random artifact jutting from it. Not a big deal and easily remedied by the eraser tool and rewriting the character, but a slight annoyance. I do suspect that that specific behavior is probably a LectureNotes idiosyncrasy though perhaps caused by my attempts to write as I'm lowering my hand to the screen or lifting it, triggering both inking and palm-rejection behavior at the same time with the occasional artifact resulting. Again, these are small niggles. I'm still glad I bought the device as it is the best tablet with a stylus within several hundred dollars or the price-point.The back of the device is plastic and it picks up fingerprints like nobodies business. You'll get used to wiping your device down every day just to keep it from looking all ghetto from all the fingerprint smudges. Also the back wears (scratches) easier than I'd like from resting on flat surfaces. Simply putting it on my desk at work, and tables and counters at home, has caused certain raised spots (I'm guessing) where the electronics press up against the plastic back to wear: loose the new plastic shine, and have lots of tiny scratches. They're not SUPER apparent (especially when covered by fingerprints), but when you wipe the device down you'll see them in the glare of overhead lights. It's just a small annoyance that I feel could have been easily rectified had Samsung selected an equally lightweight but better wearing material for the back: like maybe some soft-rubberish coated plastic? I do like that the plastic probably helps a lot in keeping the device at its lightweight--which is partly what makes it so imminently useful and usable. It just needs to be more durable.In any case, after a month of using the Note 10.1 I am still glad I bought it. And I should say that once you remove the widgets that come on the main screens of the device it really flies. I'm thrilled with its performance, but I hope it's sturdier than it seems like it *might* be. Keep in mind for my review of the Note 10.1 that I (and my wife, who somehow wears devices down a bit more rapidly than I do) use the Note 10.1 very heavily at work, school, and home--so my/our satisfaction is as power users of the device.", "Date": "October 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Ultimate tablet for professionals and artists", "Author": "GoTheDistance", "ReviewID": "RPE2CO9GX1QRB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Finally, a professional level tablet that I've been waiting for.

I honestly prefer reading books on a 7 inch tablet because they are lighter but when looking at pdf documents this tablet is much better. I decided to put a case on the tablet and it the weight went up quite a bit thought :(As far as using the S-Pen and S-Note i can't really complain much. The S-Pen feels like a real pen when you are writing not like those gummy bear stylus tips that the other tablets use to write with. S-Note works pretty well for the most part. The shape match and formula match features are fantastic although they could use a little more refinement. As an engineer student i like the formula match feature a lot since i often have to write down a lot of long formulas. There are times when the program seems to get confused with some of the Greek letters used on the formulas and it can get a bit annoying at times. Like i said, it needs refinement.The battery life is one of the first things i look at when buying a portable electronic device. Very pleased so far with its performance. Easily gets me through the day even after taking notes through out the day. I use the brightness at about a quarter and it is enough for me. Don't expect the battery to last the entire day if you have the brightness all the way up while playing HD movies all day. It is just not realistic. If you are indoor web browsing, taking notes, checking e-mail and watching a few videos it should last the entire days with no problems.The tablet takes at least 4 hours to charge fully which is a bummer. The cable that comes with the tablet is pathetically short. I don't get why all of the manufacturers insist on giving us this 1 foot long cables to charge the electronics. I guess they don't want to spend a extra 10 cents on a another couple feet of wire. I ended buying a longer cable from Amazon.I have no problems with the display at all. It is more than adequate for reading and watching movies. The display on the Ipad 3 is better and you can certainly notice the difference when you look at them side buy side. But if you are working with it alone you will see that it is not nearly as bad as some people make it out to be.The camera is by far one of the weakest things in the tablet. I personally would never use a tablet to take pictures, but if i did, i would be very disappointed. The camera is very, very mediocre. My Samsung Galaxy S3 came out 6 months before and takes much better pictures.The speaker's sound quality and the sd card slot for extra storage are big plus.with this i want to wrap up my review.

I bought it mainly for use in my university classes and for drawing. I haven't used it much for drawing yet, but it has been excellent for my university classes. The S-Pen works very well and is quite accurate.The only word of warning with this is that you should AVOID any tablet cases that have magnets in them. The S-Pen works using magnetic inductance, and therefore, magnets that are within 1 or 2 centimeters of the screen can affect the proper functioning of the S-Pen. If you put a magnet near a spot on the screen (for example: if your tablet case/folio has a magnet for attaching a strap to it, and you then fold the folio so that the magnet is behind your tablet and behind the screen within 1 cm), the S-Pen's position will not match what shows up on the screen. The floating pen position indicator will move in a direction that is away from the magnet. This means that if within one centimeter of a magnet the digital pen tip will deviate from the real pen tip by 1-3 millimeters, which makes writing quite difficult. For some reason, a lot of the cases that are indicated as being for this tablet have magnets in them. Whoever designed these cases obviously had very little knowledge of how the S-Pen works because these magnets really mess with the pen accuracy on the screen if they get too close. Although, it's important to note that this isn't permanent, it only happens when a magnet is currently near the screen.Other than that frustration (that took about a week to figure out), this tablet has worked excellently. In regard to the tablet's other functions, they also work very well (probably better than most tablets because of the larger processor and large amount of RAM). The multi-tasking works pretty well, and it can be quite useful at times such as when your in class writing notes and your professor recommends a website for some useful information. I often use it when doing homework on my tablet. Where I'll be reading my homework (a word document or PDF), and then doing it in an app like S-Note. In regard to the other aspects of the tablet, it's pretty much the same as most other android tablets that you'll find except that this tablet might run a little faster than the average tablet. The main advantage of this tablet over other tablets is the S-Pen. If your buying this tablet, it should be for the S-Pen. If you don't care for the S-Pen, the you should buy a different tablet because you could get more for you money if your willing to give up the S-Pen functionality. I think this tablet is well worth the price, but it's because I'm making great use of the pen, and this tablet is exactly what I was looking for.I'll probably update this review as to whether or not this tablet is good for drawing once I get a chance to really draw something with it.Update (Drawing):I recently tested out this tablet's drawing capabilities, and I would say that it's pretty good. It's not nearly as good as my laptop and Intuos 5 drawing pad, but honestly, the main limitation seems to be the software available. I'm using Sketchbook Pro for tablets, and it works quite well. It's pretty smooth, and it's interface has been optimized rather well for tablets. I didn't experience any slow downs while using it, so the Galaxy Note 10.1 handled the program quite well. In all honesty, the main difference between doing digital art on my Galaxy note 10.1 and my laptop with Wacom drawing pad was the lack of features available in the Sketchbook Pro app. The research I've done seems to indicate that Sketchbook Pro is one of the best apps out there for drawing on android tablets, and while it's quite good, it simply can't compete with the range of features available on a computer based program such as GIMP. It felt like the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 could have handled more, but it seems that the program wasn't really built with this in mind since it's missing features that could have been easily included. Nevertheless, even with these limitations, it still works quite well because these limitations can't change the fact that the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 has decent pen accuracy, which allows you to work with a decent amount of comfort when drawing. It's a little trickier to do some of the fancier things, but the basics are there, and you can do quite a bit with the basics. I did a little bit of concept art with it, and I was pretty happy with the results. It's not high detail art, but the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 is definitely viable for rough concept art work. The only gripe with the hardware that I'll mention is that there are a few spots on the screen where the pen location detection is off by 1 or 1.5 mm they are mostly near the edges of the screen. Sounds small, but it can be annoying when drawing a small detail, but it's not a big deal since you can simply move the canvas with a quick two-fingered swipe. There's not much else to say about this tablet. Overall, it's pretty decent for drawing, but the apps are a bit limited. Hopefully, the available apps gain more features in the future as people realize the potential of android pen tablets like this.If you want to see what I was able to do with it then you can check it out at my DeviantArt account, which can be found by simply googling my name.

Let me mostly concentrate on the pen/stylus feature. This is a wonderful addition and one that I yearned for for many years. It is the killer feature of Galaxy Note and qualitatively sets it apart from other Android/iPad tablets (I go so far as to say that I believe it was Steve Jobs's biggest miss to not include a pen in the iPad.) As a college professor and a parent with a son in high school, it pains me to see students carry a ton of heavy books, binders, and notebooks. A tablet, storing all their textbooks, and allowing them to take notes in class, and do their homewrok by writing (not just typing) on the screen will hopefully liberate them from carrying those horrendous ten pound backpacks.However, as good as the Note is hardware-wise, the software provided, and the software available in the Google Play Store--as of this writing--is unfortunately lacking. It pains me very much to say anything positive about Microsoft, but their bundled handwriting and journaling software with their old laptop tablets were far superior to what Samsung/Android provide. For example in MS Journal, you can select a piece of what you have already written and on the fly move, rotate, expand or shrink , make the lines/writing ticker or thiner, change color etc.), you can easily insert pages, or even space within a page between your lines. The MS Journal takes full advantage of the hardware capabilities, and makes your writing/drawing thicker/thinner based on the pressure you exert. It is as close as you can get to actual writing and drawing on a piece of paper, but with many additional features that you do not have in the traditional writing on a paper. Also there is a pretty decent handwriting recognition software (the stellar Ink program) which does a good job of \"learning\" your handwriting over time and recognizing it and turning it into typewritten text (personally, I hardly ever use this feature though).Almost none of this is available on the bundled S-Note software, nor anything else I could find in Google Play. In S-Note you can do free handwriting, and you can set colors and thickness. In fact you can choose to simulate pen, pencil, paint brush and other common kinds of drawing pens, but you cannot change what you have drawn/written after the fact. If you need to change, you must erase and start over. No selection or any kind of editing of what you already have drawn, no inserting space between your lines, no pressure sensitivity (even though the hardware allows this), none of this is provided.Speaking of erasers, the Samsung Note's pen does not have an eraser at the bottom of the stylus, like the Windows laptop tablets have. However, if you happen to have a Windows tablet (like Lenovo X200) you can use their stylus, and, long and behold, the eraser at the bottom of the stylus will indeed work as an eraser when used in S-Note!Another issue is lack of integration of the stylus and handwriting features with other applications. You cannot for instance  scribble your appointments in the calendar app, or bring up a Polaris office document and annotate on it by handwriting (there is a free draw feature in Polaris Office that can be used with the Stylus though). You can annotate a pdf file if you use Adobe Acrobat Reader for Android, but like its Windows counterpart, it is clumsy and lacks smoothness.  So basically it is up to the app developers to integrate stylus/handwriting into their apps. This shortcoming is more an issue with Android. Google needs to overhaul the Android OS to make pen/drawing/handwriting recognition integrated seamless throughout the ANdroid operating ssystem.Another quibble is the way the stylus is designed in the Galaxy Note. It is too thin and short (I understand this design choice since they want to keep the tablet as thin and light as possible, but it makes the stylus less natural as a pen). The bottom of the stylus does not act as an eraser (I do not understand this omission) and worse yet, the cross section of the stylus is rectangular, rather than circular. This means that you must insert the stylus into its place in a certain way otherwise it won't go in properly.Overall I am hopeful that the software will be upgraded and we will have better journaling apps in near future.

Samsung could have done better. The pages for handwritten notes are tiny, and you have to add new pages to write more. I find this annoying. BONUS: You can add photos and voice recordings into the notes, which is awesome, especially for students (which I am).2) Photoshop Touch is disappointing. An actual graphic designer/illustrator probably wouldn't find much use for the program. Also, the S Pen is a disappointing size and would be better if larger. I think Samsung is lying about the 1024 pressure sensitivity of the S Pen, also - at least when using Photoshop Touch. Maybe I was using it wrong, but holy crap did I have to press hard to get the pressure sensitivity to register correctly.3) Kno is a really awesome program, and I like it that I can load PDF files from DropBox and write little notes on them and stuff. I don't have any complaints about this program.Other things I have noticed:1) The tablet comes with a bunch of pre-loaded crap that I can't uninstall. I HATE THIS. I'm annoyed that in order to uninstall it, I'd have to root the phone, which screws up the warranty and future Android OS updates.2) Sometimes it's slow in registering screen touch. This is pretty universal, so I'm not going to be pissy about it.3) The tablet has FANTASTIC speakers (loud and clear).4) Skype app for Android works really well!5) The rear-facing camera takes really decent images!6) The customization and many screens/widgets/apps is really phenomenal. You can download from Android Market (Play Store) and the Samsung Store, which is really neat. I also love the Media Hub where I can buy movies. :)7) The Smart Remote (for use with Cable and TV) was SUPER EASY to set up and worked immediately with my TV (a Samsung, go figure).

Castledine", "ReviewID": "R3MW0C9HS0HV2N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Having owned an original Motorola Xoom for the past twelve months or so, I am not new to Android tablets. Therefore, this review focuses on the improvements that I feel the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 brings to this type of device.Despite the Xoom doing most of the things I expect and want from a tablet, the Note includes certain compelling new features and improved capabilities that motivated me to upgrade.The main justification for my buying the Note is the S-Pen. This is because I find it easier to handwrite and illustrate my meeting notes than to type them. I tried many tablet styluses on the Xoom because I actually prefer using a stylus over using my fingers (and leaving fingerprints). I soon discovered that none of the third party styluses offered any degree of precision. In fact, they are useless for handwriting and drawing! Therefore, an accurate stylus was something I really wanted in a tablet and the pressure sensitivity of the S-Pen is a bonus.It's important to mention that in the show-case application (S-Note), you have an option to set the tablet to respond only to the stylus input. This means that you can rest your hand on the screen, like on a real notepad, to write and draw. This is definitely something unique to the Samsung Glaxy Note range and makes for much more natural input.Something else I was interested in was the inclusion of phone functionality. With the Xoom, I used to receive SMS messages intended for the previous owner of the phone number associated with my SIM. The messages showed up in the notification area on the Xoom and I could open them in a window. However, I couldn't reply to them (or save them to reply some other way). With the Note, I now have access to SMS and MMS, as well as calls (although, they cost me extra on my data plan).The clincher was when I found out the Galaxy range of tablets (and phones) have a useful host USB Connection Kit as a reasonably priced option. This kit provides access to many USB devices (including printers, USB sticks, keyboards, mouses and SD cards). In my experience, the Xoom can only manage hard-to-find, third-party host adaptors which were flaky at best.Despite the Note being about a centimetre wider and longer than the Xoom, it is much thinner and lighter. The extra bezel width makes holding the Note easier, without accidentally touching the screen area. Obviously, holding the Note for extended periods is much less fatiguing than with the much heavier Xoom.One physical issue with the Xoom that annoys me is the location of the on-off button (on the back). This location has two disadvantages; it is difficult to get to when the tablet is lying on a desk and I often accidentally turn the Xoom on or off when grasping it (mainly when picking it up). The Note has its button conveniently located on the top edge of the device. So far, I have had far fewer accidents with it.The screen on the Note is bright and clear and suits my needs, as is the case for the Xoom. I believe that neither of these tablets needs a higher resolution. I guess that cramming in more pixels for future tablets is inevitable, mainly due to the misguided quest to \"match\" the iSlab.Being able to take screenshots (by pressing the button on the S-Pen and tapping and holding on the screen) is great. But when the image loads into an app that allows you to crop and annotate it, you have a whole new range of powerful and convenient productivity capabilities. Well done Samsung!The Note is quite responsive, having a quad-core processor and 2Gb RAM. From the myriad reviews containing benchmarking, the Note seems to be one of the fastest tablets currently available. This translates into a more responsive experience. The extra RAM is also necessary as the Note can perform some \"multitasking\" by way of a number of apps that have been designed to run alongside each other. Additionally, there are some apps that are designed to run in a subset configuration as floating windows (on top of anything else), or be expanded out to offer full functionality. I find it handy to access a pop-up calculator or the quick Note applet without disturbing my main task/s. My favourite is the Task Manager, which also manages RAM.The front-facing speakers on the Note make for much better sound than the rear-facing speakers on the Xoom. With the Xoom, watching a video requires the volume to be turned up quite loud. Even then, the sound from the speakers appears to be detached and low-fi. I sometimes remedy this with headphones or cupping my hands over the speakers to feed the sound towards the front. Neither \"solution\" is as good as having front-mounted speakers.The inclusion of an IR emitter is a nice feature, but a bit of a gimmick (for me, at least). Coupled with the Peel Smart Remote application, you can supposedly turn your tablet into a smart remote. Although I haven't thoroughly tested this feature, it appears to be reasonably functional. Nevertheless, it seems limited to just one system. So I can't set it up to control both the home theatre as well as the TV in my office.Because I would never use a tablet (nor a phone) camera for photography, if I can help it, I won't go into too much detail about the cameras in the Note. Except to say they are \"adequate\". I mainly use the rear camera with the CamScanner HD application and the front one for Skype.On the negative side, I must mention the proprietary USB/Charging connector. Apparently the output from a PC USB port isn't enough to charge the Note (which I can understand). So, when you have it connected to a PC for extended data transfer periods, you can't charge it at the same time. At least I can do this with the Xoom, as it has a separate charging socket. I would expect proprietary connectors as part of the draconian iApple ecosystem, but Android devices should all have standard USB ports and separate power sockets. As a workaround, I use the brilliant Airdroid application while the tablet sits in its charging cradle.Another negative is the lack of accessories currently available (early October 2012). Because the Note has slightly different dimensions to the Tab 2 10.1, most of the clip-on cases and the keyboard dock do not fit. I guess this will change over time.Despite the slow appearance of accessories for the Note, many of the apps that are suited to a stylus have already been updated to take advantage of the S-Pen's precision. These include Quill and Autodesk Sketchbook Pro, but not Skitch (but who uses that, anyway?). In addition, the excellent Photoshop Touch supports the S-Pen and comes preloaded (with a licence) and really does showcase the benefits of a decent stylus.In conclusion, the Note has features that considerably increase the usefulness of a tablet for me. This is mainly because the extra features are actually what I wanted; NONE of which are available on any comparable device.", "Date": "October 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Galaxy Note 10.1- Amazing Tablet for Sketch, Write and Paint :D!!!", "Author": "Miriel", "ReviewID": "R3M6OLCZMMIXU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I decided to give the opportunity to samsung instead of apple, and the truth is that I have not disappointed. What is certain is that for the ipad, there is a greater variety of applications for both writing and drawing, and taking notes. But I buy this tablet basically for the application of SNOTE. And well, after trying several apps, I must say that best for writing are: Quill, Write and Papyrus. (Write and Papyrus are free apps).However, for ipad , there are better apps for drawing in general. In my case, I stick with LayerPaintHD, and Sketchbook, that both works with layers, \"most important function\", if you are an artist or are looking for a tablet to draw. Well, if that's the case, I must say that this tablet, works great for painting and sketching, is excellent in these two applications. The sensitivity of the pencil in Sketchbook is instantaneous , almost like a normal tablet PC. In other applications, there is a delay too minimal to perceive during writing. For Quill, there is no delay in writing, the response is immediate. Quill is just like inking in OneNote, almost the same feeling. In the case of Snote, there is a minimum delay, but does not affect the sensitivity of the writing; feels quite natural and fluid stroke.I use Snote just for everything, but for the most, for sketch; It feels like a real writing paper. Also, you can change the background of the paper, for grid paper, school notebook paper etc.In general, the tablet is fast. Navigation on internet is fast. Videos on youtube are just in amazing HD. The battery life is long if you adjust (power save on) and disables screen rotation, vibration, gps, bluetooth and wifi. Screen colors feels vivid and beautiful. You can change the screen mood to: dynamic, standard and movie. Also, you can change the screen to negative colors which i like a lot by the way.The only thing I consider negative, it's the size and shape of the pen. If you're an artist, you will notice this, and later you will want to buy another larger stylus. The size of the spen it's about 4.6 inches, in comparison of a regular wacom tablet pen, of 6 inches. For me, the size is too short for my big hand, and sometimes, at several minutes of drawing, it may feels unconfortable, but it's not a big deal, it's just because i'm a maniac in this type of stuff. Also, the shape of the pen (isn't round) like the regular pens, it's an square shape.Finally, i recommend this tablet for any artist or hobbyist, that looks for a drawing tablet, or for school stuff, mathematics, just for everything you can imagine.

I had told him I wanted it since we both have the Note 2 phones.  I love the S pen feature because I take a lot of notes for work and it's easier than using my finger tip and a lot cleaner.  I also tend to send a lot of letters to Taiwan, so using the S Note, I can easily write a note and pass email it.  Rather than taking days to get there, it only takes minutes.I like the wide range of keyboard options.  Using the English keyboard, Spanish words also pop up. It makes it easier rather than swapping between English and Spanish even though they both use a Romantic alphabet.  My biggest gripe with the language inputs are the Chinese pops up first the simplified characters.  I have to dig through characters to find the traditional characters.  There also is not a Japanese option available for download unless I go to the Play Store.  Of course, I can always use the S pen to write in the characters if I want to take a quick note, however if i wish to type, it's a little harder.The camera is pretty good, both front and back.  My three year old loves to take pictures, so it's fun for him as well.Unlike the Note 2, the bottom of the screen has a little box to take a screen shot. It's easy, especially if you need to send someone instructions or an example.It comes with Polaris Office downloaded, so if you do a lot with word documents, excel, or powerpoint, you can email them to yourself and edit from home or on the go.The USB adapter for the wall is nice as it can easily separate.  The only thing I don't like is how short the cord is.  It's only about 2 feet long.The front of the tablet has two speakers, so no having to lay it down to hear sounds.  If you're watching Youtube, you can hear it better than using your smartphone since the speakers are towards you.  The screen is also big, so you can see the videos better.  It's much easier to gather a crowd around this than your iPhone (if that's your style). I have 118 coworkers in my company, so we are constantly interacting and using this during meetings to take notes or reflect data is better than wasting paper.Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who inquires.

Pull up maps, circle locations, go split screen and make notes, Like all of Samsung's other products, a winner. You can work with any bluetooth keyboard as I understand it, though I've not done so yet.

Mine was delivered in pristine condition.I view my Note as a Samsung Galaxy S3 on steroids without the cell function.  There is practically no learning curve, although in three days, I haven't explored everything it can do.One caution:  When setting it up, it will ask for your location.  Don't use the swipe to select your country.  The screen is very sensitive.  I accidentally selected Kazakhstan, thought I could change it in the settings, and was wrong.  The device must be reset.

As soon as I exited the video,  it automatically sent back into portrate.The S-Pen does take getting used to, if you haven't used a stylus on a tablet before,  it works great.  S-Note's idea pad is very useful,  allowing you to add images,  video,  as well as audio into the notes.The battery life is great,  I was using it one day, then put it to sleep (one click on the post button), and did open it till the next day, and it was still in the same battery level as before, and yes the wifi was on.The S Calender automatically sync with my Google account as soon as I logged into the tablet.The dual screen experiance works fine.For the keyboard it has the Swype feature,  which I find easier then typing,  it can be turned on our off.The E mail app that comes with it allows you to add different emails from different providers, ie gmail, go daddy, ect. And has a \"combined view\" , that shows you all the emails from all those inboxes. Even the gMail app works great on the tablet.This tablet is very slim too, light, and powerful.It's perfect if your a creative person,  especially some kind of artist or musician,  a note taker, or a student.I would absolutely recommend this over the iPad without a second thought.Enjoy", "Date": "April 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great 10 inch Tablet!", "Author": "KaTzPJamas", "ReviewID": "R1FKXRPNZXWEVT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is kind of biased because I am anti Apple products however Android can be a terrible experience if you don't have the right specs in the tablet itself. I'm a spec stickler when it comes to the internal components of computers and stuff but I think this has all the right specs with its quad core processor and 2gb ram. I actually bought this tablet for $350 from the warehouse deals and received it a couple days later (Amazon Prime). The tablet, was in near perfect condition in the original box with everything its suppose to come with. All the peelable plastic was still on and the screen was blemish/scratch free. I managed to find a teeny tiny scratch in the corner of the gray plastic. Otherwise, near perfect condition as I said.Here are the great things about this tablet.-Samsung released android 4.1 (Jelly Bean) for this tablet which equals better performance and a few extra things here and there.-16gb storage space is sufficient. I don't recommend buying the 32gb version because this has a Micro SD slot for extra storage space up to 64gb. Unless you love downloading lots of apps and downloading movies or something. I just stream everything media related via Hulu+, Netflix, Youtube, or Spotify/Pandora. So I don't care much for the space.-The quad core processor runs everything quickly and smoothly. The tablet runs as smooth as butter. No Hiccups.-The 2 Gb of RAM lets you multitask very well and you will never feel like the tablet is slowing down.-Samsung has their overlay over the stock android interface. Personally I like it a bit better.-Samsung has their own app market and they pre-install some apps on your tablet. The good news is they aren't complete junk. I find them useful because I'm a student.-very responsive. The touch screen is great.-the tablet has an IR blaster so I can control my own TVs and other things with the tablet.-Smart Stay. Samsung has an option called Smart Stay. Normally with a smart phone or tablet you will be looking at something on the screen. Occasionally you have to keep touching it for the screen to remain on without defaulting to off. With Smart Stay, the front facing camera will look at you. It will recognize when you are looking at the screen or when you are not looking at it. If you are looking at the screen the device will remain on and you don't have to do those occasional touches to reassure your tablet that you are still using it and make sure it doesn't automatically turn off.-on screen keyboard is customizable. Someone would think that a 10 inch wide screen is hard to type on. The keyboard can be changed in 3 different ways. It can be a big keyboard, a small keyboard that you can drag anywhere on the screen, or a split up keyboard that has half of a keyboard on one side of the screen and the other half on the other side. It works well if you are holding it widescreen so you can type with just your thumbs and still maintain a good hold on the tablet.Something to note is that this tablet can do certain apps side by side on the screen. I think that's a new thing coming out but this is the first tablet i know of to be able to run apps side by side on the same screen at the same time.Bad things (I think)-The S pen will go in this category because I don't particularly think its all that useful. However, I do use it for taking notes on the note app. The S pen inserts right into the tablet and blends in seamlessly. You'd never know its there unless you're looking for it. Again, the S pen is a personal opinion. I like having it as an option but I don't use it 95% of the time. Vanity is vanity I will say.-The screen resolution. A lot of phones and tablets nowadays are making a big deal bout ppi (pixels per inch). I will say things like Apples retina display or the amoled screen that samsung is using now on newer phones/tablets and the crazy resolution displays on the nexus tablets will kick this tablet's butt. The 1280x800 resolution looks good but if you are comparing detailed photos or something with those things I mentioned; It will seem lame. Words and pictures can look pixel-ee at times.-Another thing to note about the screen. When you are at the home screens, there is like a literal inch on both the left and right sides of the screen where you cannot place apps or anything. I feel like that is space that can be used for placing more icons or something but when you touch the empty space the home screen will go the next screen over. Same in your app drawer. I haven't found an option that can turn that off or whatever but I should let you know that. If it matters you can fit 56 app icons on one home screen. I'm a widget fan so I dont have the Ipad look of pure apps on a screen.-The speakers can get loud which isn't bad but when you turn the tablet from widescreen to tall screen (as I call it) I just think the tablet looks a bit weird especially since the speakers will be top and bottom and slightly to the right or left. This tablet was certainly meant to be used in widescreen which I'm okay with.Overall this is a great tablet. It looks good when I don't have it in the case and I looks good with my cool case too. The side front facing speakers get loud. Honestly I cannot think of a feature that this tablet doesn't have. Besides maybe a super cool high resolution screen there's really nothing other tablets can do that this one cannot. If anything this tablet has more features and more potential. If Samsung were to upgrade this thing they should put in one of those nice new octa-core processors and a nice AmoLED screen. If you are looking for a 10 inch tablet I would say this is a great one to buy. If not, I would probably point you in the direction of the new 8 inch note tablet that Samsung is releasing or the Nexus 10.

There are lots of answers but it is an important question to ask.  Across the board tablets do not fulfill all the aspects of computing that a laptop or desktop computer might, and for those aspects that they do fulfill, the tend to do so with some caveats.  For me it was the desire for an eReader with some mobile computing capabilities.Next, there are a metric ton of options.  I will not directly compare this tablet to an iPad because the pros and cons for each platform are dizzying.  Apple does a great job of innovating and packaging hardware and software.  They make a fine product that is very usable.  Android is more open and though that comes with its own pain, it is what I like though.  Still there are so many choices that your head can spin.  Size is one factor and a Seven inch tablet proved too small for me to see some diagrams.  Manufacturer is another factor and again, you can find many pros and cons for each.  Samsung alone has several tablet offerings and you may find another fine Samsung tablet that more closely fits your budget if you like Samsung.  I chose this manufacturer in part because of my Samsung phone.  Just trying to find a decent tablet can be taxing with all the options and issues.  If it fits your budget, this is a real nice tablet and it offers some capabilities that others don't.Pros:1.  Build quality is top notch.  It has the look and feel of a top of the line tablet--and at this price it should.  It favorably compares to the iPad in this category.2.  Thin.  That may not sound like much of a pro, but other 10 inch tablets felt harder to hold for very long partly due to their thickness.  Again, it compares favorably to the iPad in this category.3.  Battery life.  Android has lots to learn about managing its battery, but this tablet will run for several days of moderate use on a single charge.  Moderate use would not include near constant video watching and gaming, but reading, web surfing and some rather light gaming.4.  sPen and Photoshop Touch.  As a trained Photoshop user (I know, odd description), I find having a stylus for artwork very useful.  But the sPen's use in other areas may not be what the hype leads you to believe.  With a bit of practice you might just not be able to live without it though.5.  Quad Core processor is necessary IMHO.  I've used several tablets and smart phones with different processors and the best in my opinion is a quad core.  Now I would be the first to say that I probably will never truly task a quad core to its max potential.  But if you hate lag, you'll love a quad core because there's just about always enough processor for whatever the device is doing.  Don't expect a quad core to be amazingly faster than a dual core, but it can handle concurrent tasks with aplomb.Cons:1.  Its thin and uses Gorilla Glass.  You need a case to keep it safe and increase the potential of holding on to it, and the case options are rather poor.  There is at least one tri-fold case I like so far.2.  Build materials collect finger prints as a hobby.  This bugs me a bit and I carry a micro-fiber cloth for the screen wherever I go, but without a case, the back gets as much or more cloth time.3.  Magnets can disturb the sPen and turn on the tablet.  This can limit case choice as well since many of them use magnets.  The one I like does but they are well placed and don't get in the way.  Yet another one I thought would be good had magnets in places where the tablet would turn-on once you closed the flap.In my view, the multitasking is more hype than capability.  Its nice to have, but entirely too limited and it is a bit of a hack.  If the underlying operating system is not designed with the ability to do a thing then you can be assured you will not be completely happy with a hack like this.  Still, it has some uses.I've already said the sPen capability is partly hype, and I may be being a bit unkind toward it.  If you are expecting to use it to take notes, be prepared to be disappointed.  Unless your handwriting is stellar--and since mine is not, I'm guessing here--you will not find its use in this regard very easy.  With a bit of practice though you might learn to love it.  Samsung's sPen enabled applications look nice enough and offer some nice capabilities like text, formula, and shape recognition.Other reviews have complained about the lack of ports, but you can buy an adapter to give you those ports.  I've found I don't use the extra ports all that much so it isn't a big deal for me.  If it is, you may want to factor-in the cost and inconvenience of the adapter.", "Date": "February 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love this thing.", "Author": "Kris J Wineman", "ReviewID": "R2FM3LDZY9TWVO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love my tablet. Here are a few things about why I enjoy it so much. Light weight, thin body. The plastic in the back doesn't bother me at all. I've read some reviews and watched probably the same videos as you talking about how the plastic bends and makes noises, well I guess I'm not trying to break my tablet with my steel fingers or something because it hasn't been an issue. Video playback is awesome, 720p is good enough for me on a 10 inch screen, colors look great and picture isn't blurry or jagged. The audio is pretty nice for a tablet, easy to hear since the speakers are up front facing you, but you kind of have to watch out for the levels if you like to use your tablet in bed with your significant other, they might get up and give you the death stare. The S-Pen is what I got this bad boy for, and I don't find myself using it all THAT often, but when I do, it's for art work, jotting down notes, doodling and ideas. The thing is darn handy when I don't want to break out the thumb typing on a larger screen.Things that I find lacking are the shutter speed of the camera, just because you can get high resolution 5mp images does NOT mean you can capture anything moving. Most things that move while you shoot or if you have unsteady hands like I do will mean blurry photos. Video isn't that great either, but this is a tablet we're talking about here, not a Canon/Nikon/Sony dSLR or video camera. If there is nothing else to take a photo with, a quick family snapshot in a well lit area this does fine. Aesthetically there is a bit of plastic on the sides were the speakers are, I don't much like the look of it, if it were a bit smaller I'd enjoy the look of it more, but honestly when I'm using it I don't notice it. So far my biggest gripe is that there isn't a keyboard case/cover for it like the Tab 10.1 2. The logitech case is awesome, but doesn't fit the slightly larger Note (thanks extra plastic that I don't know what you're for) and I've been waiting on a Samsung variant, but nothing has come along yet. Samsung is also pretty bad at releasing updates to new android firmware, but those things can be worked around.For me it came down to the Asus Transformer Prime, the Note 10.1, and the iPad wasn't really even in the running.

No iPad bashing from me.  I've also been spending a bit of time on an Asus Vivo Tab RT, which is really a terrific tablet as well.  And I've been playing a bit with a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2.0 7\" and a Kindle Fire HD 7\".  I love different things about all of these and believe they all have a place.  However, the device I am most likely to pick up first is the Samsung Note 10.1.  There is no doubt that lower resolution on this tablet is a slight disappointment, but this is really only an issue if you are heavily accustomed to working on a full HD+ tablet (iPad with Retina display, Nexus 10, etc.).Pros:* Light (feels much lighter than my iPad 2), making it much more enjoyable to use* Gorgeous screen - bright with vivid colors* microSD card slot - a huge advantage over the iPad or Nexus 7* Fast - great quad-core processor offering speedy performance* Multitasking - this is limited, but is an awesome feature that no other Android tablets, or iPads, offer (Win 8 RT tablets like my Asus Vivo Tab RT offer very, very limited multitasking)* Speakers - clear, reasonably strong, and very well placed* Buttons - easy to use, very responsive (would be nice if the volume & power buttons were further separated, but this is similar to most other tablets, and you get used to it.* Keyboard - There are few keyboard configurations. I'm currently using the split keyboard which makes for quick & easy 2-handed typing.  I find the keyboard designs on the Note 10.1 to be much better than the iPad and Windows 8 tablets.* IR-blaster with Smart Remote app - not a critical feature, but the ability to use the tablet as a remote makes it all the more useful* S Pen - this, of course, is the most distinctive feature of the Note 10.1.  Sure you can use a stylus on other tablets, but this pen/tablet combo is pressure-sensitive and takes the tablet computing experience to a new level. For business/productivity as well as art & photography, this is a fantastic feature.Cons:* Price - there is a huge jump in price from the 10\" Tab to the 10\" Note 10.1.  You are paying a premium for a better processor and the S Pen.  These features justify the higher price, but if you don't need them, look at the 10\" Tab.* Low-res screen - given the cost, it is definitely disappointing that Samsung didn't offer a better screen on the Note 10.1.* No Jelly Bean upgrade as of Dec 30, 2012 (released in Germany on Dec 12, so there is hope, but it is disappointing that the upgrades don't come faster - though this is true of other Android tablets).This is not a perfect tablet, but then again, one doesn't exist yet.  A full HD screen would make this pretty close. If you're debating between this and an iPad, I think this is a clear winner unless you have a specific need for the iPad's breathtaking Retina display.  The S Pen makes it much more usable, the microSD slot allows you to expand the storage, and the price (currently as low as $399) are all benefits over the iPad.If you can afford the added expense of the Note 10.1 over the 10\" Tab, then this is a fantastic deal.  I give it 5 starts not b/c it is perfect, but because it is a solid tablet that works well and offers an unbeatable combination of features.  Having said all of this, think about your needs.  Note that if you are considering a 7\" form factor, the Samsung Galaxy 7.7 is clearly the best tablet of its size on the market (hard to find, but Verizon is offering it for just $399 right now with 4G/LTE (no contract needed).  Or wait a little while longer as there are credible rumors that a 7\" Note is in the works.  That will presumably offer a display comparable to the Galaxy 7.7 but with the benefits of the Note line.  I find it easy to justify having both 7\" and 10\" tablets, but if I had to pick just one, I might opt for the Galaxy 7.7 (now - until the rumored 7\" Note appears).", "Date": "December 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Looking for something better than an iPad?", "Author": "BamaFan33", "ReviewID": "R1OT9P166FQ1PD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Look no further!

Every time you pause, and start writing again, it starts a new text box. So in the end you're left with fragments of sentences which just looks messy. So I just stick to jotting stuff down.-had some problems with charging the battery, don't know if it will work better after a few charge cycles tho.-the screen keeps dimming and brightening almost at random(even when it's not set to power saving mode)***hopefully Samsung will release some updates to make adjustments to the above concerns, but overall the tablet is great!What I liked:-the pen works great! It's an indispensable part of this tablet! Now that i've become so accustomed to it, I'll never go back to using tabs without pens(that are actually optimized for the tab! not just stylus pens that are mere extensions of our fingers!)-the multiscreen works great, and hopefully Samsung will add more apps that are compatible with it.Personally, I think this is the best tablet on the market today especially for students who love to multitask & save time doing homework and assignments!

I was hoping to purchase the tablet from Amazon but Costco was offering an unbeatable deal. Plus, their return policy is 90 days no questions asked whereas Amazon is 30 days unopened.Initially, I was interested in a 7\" tablet, because I thought it would be more convenient to carry around than a 10\" tablet. I bought the Samsung Galaxy 7\" Tab 2. It is a good quality product that can easily fit into a backpack or purse. However, a month later I tested the Note 10.1 and especially liked the S Pen, which is the stylus. Having been a long time Palm Pilot and Treo fan, the S Pen resurrected a familiar friend. By the way, Palm was ahead of its time. If only they had been on top of their strategic planning, Apple and Samsung would be playing catch up today. Anyway, before deciding on the Note10.1, I returned the 7\" Tab 2 and tested the iPad and Surface tablets. The iPad Retina display is a beauty and iOS is user-friendly. However, the iPad feels heavy and is over priced. Because I have an Android OS mobile phone, it would only make sense to keep streamlined with an Android OS tablet. The Surface is sweet. I love the cardboard thin Bluetooth keyboard that connects magnetically. However, the Surface is a bit pricey and I've learned the hard way not to buy any first generation Microsoft product. Although it was tempting especially with the new Nokia Lumia 920 as a pair, I was sold on Samsung's S Pen.If you are seeking in depth research on specs and features, there are many great Amazon reviews with such details. I am a casual user and tech/gadget enthusiast. I will probably never tap into the deep potential of the Note 10.1, but that's okay. After several weeks exploring and loving the S Pen, the Samsung Galaxy  Note 10.1 is a definite keeper. I recently purchased an excellent MoKo Slim-Fit Folio Cover Case from Amazon for just $20. I'm glad I didn't buy one for $50 at BestBuy. If you are a student, the Note 10.1 is an excellent tool. I wish this product existed when I was in college. I just bought my wife the Samsung Galaxy Note II phablet. It is like a 5.5\" version of the 10.1 tablet. We are both very satisfied owners of the Samsung Galaxy Note family of products.

I'm a somewhat savvy computer user but am relatively new to the smartphone world and this is my first tablet, so keep that in mind.Out of the box there were very few instructions so I stumbled my way along and finally downloaded the online manual.  The display is nice and bright and battery life pretty good, nice sound from front-facing speakers, very fast. Pretty easy to customize home screens once I had instructions.I was really glad I purchased screen savers, a carrying case, and a 32 Gig MicroSD chip along with the tablet.  I put the Mini-guard matte anti-glare screen protector on right out of the box so there would be minimal chance for dust and that worked really well.  The protector looks great (little glare), works fine with the S-pen, and wasn't too hard to get on without bubbles. Haven't yet figured out how to put files onto the SD chip instead of the internal drive.The tablet comes with a two year 50 Gig access to Dropbox (file storage).  After two years that will cost you...current price for 50 Gig is $10/month.  Free Dropbox storage is only 2 gig.  If you switch to SugarSync you could get 5 Gig for free. Dropbox also recently had a data breach, so that may be a consideration. I haven't decided yet whether to activate Dropbox or switch to SugarSync.I've had a few issues and was surprised to find Samsung Customer Support not very helpful.  The Accuweather widget was displaying the wrong time and I couldn't figure out why. Samsung didn't know either and could only suggest I reset the tablet and go back to factory specs, which I refused to do (didn't want to lose the apps I'd downloaded).  With some googling I discovered that I'd neglected to set the GMT time field. The main tablet clock display was correct; only the weather app was wrong.  Turns out that once I set the GMT to Eastern Std Time, the weather app sync'ed just fine. Glad I didn't reset.I also want to be able to charge my tablet from my car, and called Samsung to find out what the watt, volt and amp requirments would be for an inverter to charge the tablet. After being on hold for a few minutes I was told that only the design team has that information and they won't release it because they are protecting against someone reverse-engineering their design.  Sigh... I guess I will again have to hunt for myself to see if I can find specs.I don't know whether Samsung is inexperienced in the tablet world and their customer service isn't up to speed, or they are reacting to all the litigation issues with Apple, or both, but I'm disappointed that I'm having to figure things out myself.  Probably a good learning experience for me, but be forewarned if you're not really tech-savvy and wanting to venture into the tablet world....you won't get much help from Samsung.

It was heavy and starting to show it age, but in general, it was a great device.  I spilled juice on my Xoom, which killed it, and so looked for a new device.  The Galaxy Note had some of the best and most consistently good reviews on the Internet, and given how much I loved and used my previous tablet, I decided to upgrade to the Galaxy.Good:- Lightweight- Good screen- Good sound- The S-Pen is nice, though I use it mostly in games and programs when the touch zones are too small for my fingers.  There are times when you press a button or select something with the pen and it does not register, and you have to press a second time.- Fast, however, while faster than my old Xoom I have to say the difference is not all that noticeable.  It does switch between applications quickly, and when running two applications in split screen, seems to handle them both well.- Connects easily to my PC- Relatively stable.  I have yet to see it freeze or get into a state that requires a reboot.  (But, see my note below)Not so good:- I can feel the body flex when I hold it and I am not confident it would survive a serious fall (I once dropped my Xoom on concrete and it survived).  Also, the body is smooth and slick, and until I had a case I found it hard to keep a firm hold on the device.- The split screen is a nice idea, but only works for certain apps.  When I got the device I expected to be able to have any 2 apps running at the same time, so I could watch Netflix while using IMDB, etc.  Thus far, I have only found one or two apps from the market that support the split screen function.- I have encountered a number of minor Interface problems, none of them are fatal, but they are annoying.  For example, it will mute itself and it is very hard to unmute, or the settings menu on the taskbar won't open, etc.  These are hard to track down as bugs, but a Google search shows I am not the only one to see these problems.- The amount of bloatware on the device is terrible.

I jot down all the discussions during meetings, highlight with digital markers for certain things, add signatures, save my writings as pdf files, and send them to people. I just hate using laptop during meetings - the clicking sound from keyboard just distracts everyone and sometimes it can be quite annoying. Physical papers, nice but archiving it is just pain in the butt. Finally, I am using a digital paper!Also, some apps allow me to take advantage of s-pen's pressure sensitive input. I occasionally sketch things, s-pen is quite responsive and its behavior is predictable although not perfect.

Let me start by saying I had low expectations for the S Note app.  I expected a half-assed branded app, put out to brag about as a feature.  What Samsung has delivered here is instead something that can rival LaTex in final product: Neat, orderly notes.  Never mind the smooth, accurate, and responsive pen input, this tablet comes loaded with a pretty accurate function input tool, a shapes tool, and a writing-to-type input feature in it's productivity tools.  Hand write and equation as the professor spews his dirty intellectual filth on his white board, and I jot it down, poorly, and Samsung picks up the slack by turning into a neat formula. I hit \"insert\", size the object down a la MS word, and move it with a drag gesture to place it where I wish.  The take away here is this: If you're a student, don't buy and iPad, buy one of these.  If you're a writer or an engineer or anyone who actually wants neat documents made on the fly WITH YOUR HAND, pick one of these up.  The iPad just can't compete for productivity.  And if you're on the Microsoft side of things with your tablet preference, good news: Samsung owns the stylus tech, the algorithms, and the app, so expect to see a Win RT S Note released on their Win 8 surface products.  That said, the way android performs on this tablet, it's quite capable without x86! I have to mention that this machine is pretty powerful...

It's a better value than iPad2 with more features and functionality. Of special note is the ability to add external storage using MicroSD.I'm a novice to Android, being a Microsoft and Apple user until I bought the Note 10.1, so I can't address this issue. I'll address unit's features that are appealing to me.1. The S-pen is very good, much like the Surface Pro's pen, except it's at half the price.2. Handwriting recognition is restricted to S Note and other Samsung apps. In order to use handwriting recognition in editing a Word document using other apps, say, TextMaker, I have to download another handwriting recognition app such as 7notes with Mazec, which has its own issues.3. The display is nice and bright and the unit can be used even outside on a sunny day. However, the glossy display reflects badly. Applying a matt screen protector affects the S-pen's functionality somewhat, making it less sensitive and creating a drag. It'd be great have a glass anti-glare display finish that does not affect the S-pen's functionality.4. Battery drain seems faster than iPad. I have to charge pretty much every other day and at times daily if I use it a lot. I don't remember having to recharge the iPad the same day regardless of usage.5. Speakers stereo separation is very good but the lower frequency sound is poor.6. Screen rotation is a bit too sensitive. I found I had to switch it off more frequently than I had to with the iPad.7. S Note is the highlight of the unit and the reason I bought the tablet. It's very good and enables tracking pen strokes in a video mode and voice narration. They are *not* automatically synchronized--you have to do it yourself when you play back pen strokes and the narration. Nonetheless, it impressed the audience.8.

The key feature for me is the stylus - Thinkpad also has one - so that I can take digital handwritten notes for my numerous meetings, tasks, thoughts, ideas, etc.  Thinkpad did all of this for me and I liked Thinkpad quite a bit, but it had a few problems: a) the battery life was terrible, especially since the android upgrade to jelly bean, b) it took way too long to recharge, c) it was a bit on the big side of the tablet market.  The Galaxy Note 10.1 is everything that Thinkpad could do vis-\u00e0-vis stylus handwriting with outstanding battery life, fairly quick recharge, and in a slim, stylish package. I find the Samsung S-Note application to be very good and on par with the Quill application I had been using on my Thinkpad - I could go back to  Quill anytime but I find the S-Note's ability to organize notes using subfolders to be superior to Quill's.  Multi-task screens are an important breakthrough.  I enjoy using Polaris office (pre-packaged on my Note) side-by-side with S-Note, or with the Internet browser.  I wish that the Note could place any application in multi-task mode (side-by-side on one screen), but it only works with some of the built-in applications.  I also wish it was easy to set another application as the default, but even though I prefer Dolphin browser and have set it as default, I always get asked which browser I want to use for certain system tasks...annoying.

I probably have about 100 hours of use on it so far. The only thing that I don't like about it is that there is no usb port. That's not too much of a big deal. I just hook it up to my computer and download the movies or music onto the memory card. I also downloaded about 2500 songs from my Google music account via wi-fi. It took about 4 hours, I guess.

The word matching in Swype is significantly better.Papyrus over S-Note. The vector based drawing and minimalistic Android-centric interface is excellent. The one thing I would add is in-line photo/video capture. That said, the formula entry capabilities of S-Note are amazing, as is the integration with Wolfram Alpha. If I get to crunching integrals at some point, I could definitely see a nice reason to dive back in to S-Note.Chrome browser over the Samsung provided browser.GMail app over the built in Mail app (provided that you mostly use GMail of course...)The multi-screen apps are only the Samsung native ones, and really, I didn't find the feature to add much to the tablet experience.PROS:Speedy and responsive under normal use.Nice beautifully bright screen.The S-Pen is 100% undiluted awesome and solves the digital lab-notebook problem I've had since forever.The face-tracking to stay awake function is actually quite amazing and a very nice touch.CONS:Tablet would be straight up awesome and amazing if only they had gone for the high resolution screens that Samsung manufactures, as it stands, I know that I'll be purchasing the high-res version as an upgrade once its available.Auto-dimming is fairly idiotic in is response to the environment.A fair amount of the default software is unnecessary fluff.

It is much more responsive when taking handwritten notes, and the larger pen does feel better.My one major qualm with the tablet is that you cannot move apps to the SD card like I am able to with my galaxy note phone. I purchased the 16 gig version of the tablet along with a 32 gig SD card for just that purpose, only to find out that I can't do that.

As there are not many choices at this point in time, I decided to give the Note 10.1 a try. The Note 10.1 is smooth, responsive, and the stylus is very easy to use accurately. I use the stylus about 80% of the time, even when not writing, as it makes navigation far more accurate. I love the productivity increase from the multiscreen feature, and use it daily in class and while doing online math homework. The main requests I have for Samsung are that they make the next device with a metal backplate, and use a higher resolution screen, even at an additional cost. The device is very well made, and the plastic is not low quality, but it doesn't have the feel and heft of an aluminium device that I prefer. If I understand correctly, Samsung was not able to offer this device with a higher resolution screen due to constraints from the Wacom stylus. Hopefully that will be sorted out by the next release.The TV remote feature is just plain cool, and while not extremely useful, does help for those times I've misplaced my remote. The front facing speakers are great, and sound good enough for what they are.I seriously appreciate Samsung's on board memory flexibility. A mere 50 dollar increase between the 16 and 32gb tablets, and a microSD expansion slot, make this a no brainer compared to other tablets which don't have expandable memory.

The pen is just amazing, really responsive and is awesome for note taking.The specs are not the best, but I owned an infinity and returned right away i noticed some issues. These consisted of tne following:  -Continuous force closing  -Short battery life  -Light bleeding in various screen areas  -Felt uncomfortable in hands  What filled the cup was that in the lower right part on the screen, i was able to feel and hear a \"click\"  sound when pressing on it. I have read various reviews stating the same issue. And that it is due to bad glueing in the screen.The infinity has the best specs( quad core 1.7 ghz, gorilla glass 2, 1920 x 1200 screen resolution, keyboard dock, etc.), but all that only looks great in a spec sheet. While using the tablet, you are able to notice all those issues and will definetly return it. But let stop talking about the infinity and let's talk about what you want.  The note 10.1 is blazing fast thanks to its quad core 1.4 ghz exynos processor and its 2gb of ram, lag free and full of features. The 2 gigs of ram are great because the upcoming generation of tablet apps are really heavy and take some space while running. The screen looks decent enough, even though the ipad's is way better, this screen is fine and looks great. You cqn only notice the pixels if you stick your nose into the screen.

Palm rejection is almost flawless. The Polaris software included may be even faster. Better yet, it converts to Word Format. If you have experience with gestures for handwriting recognition, you will benefit. Don't be fooled, it isn't perfect. Much depends on the quality of your handwriting.*Size & weight are fine.

I understand the resolution is limited by the Wacom tech.* The software is not as integrated as IPad, as expected for Android. To get the best use of the tablet required going thru settings to customize. Not bad if you know Android, but could be intimidating for novice users. It does allow you to make the machine your own.

PDF doesn't work well inside S Note if it's large or landscape. Download EZPDF Reader to solve that. S Note is good, but I'm also trying Lecture Notes.

I have an iPad 2 as well.  I use both but I find the Galaxy Note 10.1 far more fun to use and far more productive.Here are the differences, in my own view / opinion...iPad 2:- Start iPad, and your main screen shows a bunch of shortcuts... BORING!- iPad WiFi model DOES NOT HAVE GPS hardware! Apple did a very good job hiding this info coz not many knows this, even my apple fan friends and co-workers didn't know it. Always tell them to google it. Only the iPad 3g/4g has GPS radio.  So if you tether and drive around, your car icon on the map will not get updated till about every minute or so. So when Navigating, and by the time you need to make a turn, you already passed it when iPad says, Left turn ahead!- The new iPad map SUCKS. Traffic updates are super slow, it SUCKS.  I asked for directions, it wants me to swim the ocean. Bring swimming gear!- No Adobe Flash, so most web sites right now, don't work! Wait for HTML 5 to be adopted more? A lot more?- iPad does indeed look nice, I give it that. I like the metal case. Makes my hands super cold though on winter; need gloves to use it.- I find my self using iPad for Web only, even before I bought the Note 10.1.- Hand me an iPad or iPhone, and I don't know what fun stuff to do with it coz when I start it, all I see are frkn a bunch of Shortcuts. At least my Windows 7 PC has Gadgets... Right???- iPad makes me look hip. Sorry to say, but many people still give that `interested' look if you have an apple device.- iPad 3 does have very nice resolution when I checked demo at best buy. iPad 2 screen looks the same to me as Note 10.1.Galaxy Note 10.1:- Note 10.1 main screen shows stuff that are working and doing something, so it's not boring. The Widgets. Almost all apps comes with Widgets.  If you want to see the boring Shortcuts page, tap the Apps button.- Note 10.1 gives you all kinds of working widgets i.e. weather, turn-on/off led flashlight, music player widget, photo album widgets, several time zone clocks, utility meters, Facebook updates, etc.  I don't need all of them, but I really like the Weather Widget and music player (i can do Next / Prev Song right there in main screen).- Load or take a lot of videos and then start the Video Player app and you'll be amazed.  ALL your videos are in Preview Mode. Not only it really looks nice seeing each box move, but it is DEFINITELY helpful in finding the video you want to view.- Multi-Screen ROCKS!  Very useful.- I was able to install Adobe Flash and now web pages that use Flash works.- WiFi-Direct Transfer functionality is very useful. You can transfer several files from/to another device with WiFi-Direct super fast.  From what I remember, 500 MB of pics and videos in like 1 minute.- Note 10.1 WiFi model HAS GPS radio hardware. So go ahead and tether it and drive around and ask for directions, you won't get lost. No need to wear swimming trunks.- Android released Talking NAVIGATION since like 2 or 4 yrs ago. Apple just now got it! And now all iPhone users say, Oh, my Nav Talks now! What da heck!- Google Maps ROCK. Traffic is fast. Navigation has SATELLITE VIEW option so it shows LANDSCAPE (or BIRDS EYE) SATELLITE View while it's navigating.  AMAZING!- S Pen is so useful for editing Pics, writing stuff, etc.- That pop-up video player ROCKS!- Note 10.1 does not look as nice as iPad. I don't like the plastic. I hope Samsung release metal models. Apple still reign on design, I think.- Note 10.1 Battery seems to run out faster. But then again, I use Note 10.1 a lot more than my iPad 2. And I know GPS radio uses more power (again iPad WiFi model do NOT have GPS radio; bring swimming trunks).Anyways, these are just my own thoughts and opinion. I know i sound like i really love the Note 10.1 a lot more than my iPad 2. I hope I did not offend anyone on this review.

The primary uses for me are keeping a hand-written journal and use as a portable art pad, so having a wacom pen, the same technology I use at my desktop for professional graphics work, was a must. Then Wacom came out with their own pen for the Galaxy Note, the Bamboo Feel. It's full size, more responsive, looks and feels great in the hand, and I use it most of the time.I started the journal using Samsung's S-note app but had problems saving files--some files disappeared for reasons I still have not discovered, and I lost about six weeks of journal, hence the half star deduction from the rating. I solved that issue by exporting every day's entries to Dropbox as both .snb and PDF files. Eventually, I switched to using Papyrus, a vector based app that allows for a thinner pen line than S-note's thinnest .5mm. Papyrus also allows export to PDF, but because it's vector-based, it's a cleaner file that prints more crisply than S-note's jpg PDF export. I can also open a Papyrus PDF page in Adobe Illustrator on my desktop for further modification of the vectors beyond what can be done in Papyrus.For artwork I like the Sketchbook Pro app best. It has an abundance of brushes and allows layers. It also can export a PSD file that keeps the layers intact so further work can be done in PhotoShop or Painter on my desktop.At first I was concerned about the screen resolution, but it's very sharp and bright and has not been an issue.

It is also not innovating as much now and not giving people what they want - bigger screens and meaningful upgrades.So I switched and got the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 because it was on sale for $50 off and I got it in 1 day shipping thanks to Amazon.The unit is beautiful - light and the white is nice. It is actually too slick. So I bought a Poetic cover as well. There is an expansion slot (up to 32GB only) and I popped in the Sandisk 32GB card. I also upgraded the OS to 4.1.2 as of now (one thing to note is if you get an error - firmware was modified outside and so no updates will be possible, then you need to remove the SD card and retry and it will be fine. Bug in HW check coding).The screen resolution is lower and it sometimes shows but it is more than adequate. The unit came charged thankfully. With moderate use, I lost about 24% a day - one netflix movie, browsing, emails etc. about 3 hours used.On standby it seems to lose about 15% a day. So the battery life is more than adequate. We may need charging every 3 days or so.The unit is blazing fast. The quad core really shows here. Everything is super zippy. With 2GB memory, you can easily launch like 10 apps at a time and also it can truly multitask (only approved apps) so you can have more apps running at same time if you choose.The swype keyboard is brilliant as is the S-Voice. However, some output seems wrong. I asked \"how far is Canada from United States\" and it said \"1530 miles\" or something which is a head scratcher.The S-pen is just brilliant. Handwriting to sketching to jotting notes. Simply brilliant. You will need to buy more apps to fully leverage its power though. The samsung store/play store is good as well.The screen is crisp and clear but I can tell the iPad is sharper and crispier and seems more \"vibrant\" and HD sharp than this one.Overall, this seems like a much better buy than an iPad. However, if people would want an iPad, I would say it is still worth it for its better screen resolution and intuitiveness. (for. e.g. I couldn't figure out how to delete the accidentally created 7 home screens. Not easily intuitive.

The S- Pen is great for writing , drawing , photo editing and such Ive used stylii since the old palm pilot days and I have a wacom capture tablet connected to my computer already so I am totally at home with it .It comes preloaded with photoshop for android which I had already tried out on my Note 2 cell phone and Im quite happy with it .The speakers face you and give good sound and Ive been able to use hbo go ,netflix , crunchy roll and youtube with great results .the optimum app will not work on the the note as of yet but thats no fault of the tablet , thats optimums fault for not updating the app for use on more android tablets .blue tooth headphones as well as regular headphones work fine , of course that also depends on your sound taste .As for connectivity I was able to use the allshare program to connect to my note 2 cell phone as well as my computer and send files back and forth no problem . You can also connect directly to your omputer using the included usb cable and transfer files either using the Kies software or windows media player .Storage is 32 gb but you dont want to use that for saving files and media , the tablet will hold up to a 64 gb card and thats where you should save all of your pics and vids and music to I am using a sanddisk ultra 64 very zippy and smooth .i did purchase the Aduro Samsung Galaxy tab extra long usb charge and sync cable thank god because the one that comes with it is like 5 inches I have no idea what they where thinking when they came up with that one . SO if you just want a Tablet to have one there are alot of cheaper ones out there that are just fine , But if you are artistic or a student or need to be able to wite down things then this is a must have .

So no i am not an expert that is going to go into extreme detail about all the technical stuff but i do a lot of research on tablets and a lot of technology so yes im an average person but most people that will buy this are probably like me. So here is what i think:This tablet is amazing at what it can do! I use it for school so ill try to limit it to that.  I use it mainly for notes which is great because the s pen is so precise and it has a lot of writing options: different colors, different writing utensils, different sizes. It is just great. It is also easy to organize notes because they save it in a format similar to a windows computer (folders, files, etc).  They also have a function to draw perfect shapes, to put in text, and others. But what i think is the coolest is the function one, you tap the icon then write a function and hit search and it will bring up multiscreen with the browser and give you all sorts of information on the function.(derivitaves, graphs, alternate forms, and a lot more). So this brings us up to multiscreen.The multiscreen function is also great for school. People arent very fond of the fact that there is only polaris office, email, gallery, video player, s note and browser to use but dont be so greedy because it is great! You can takes notes on something from the internet very quickly, once i get word documents on it i will use that to take notes, so it really comes in handy.I also would like to mention that my teachers sometimes give me printed off notes. This is a problem right?.... Nope! Download the app camscanner (its free!!) And you can take a picture of the paper and you can turn it into something that looks like a word document! It isnt perfect but usuable and readable, i truly am amazed by that app.Something not school related, the smart remote feature is very very easy to set up and helpful, i wont go too far with it but it is definately a plus! Well there isnt much more i need to talk about because i love everything about it... except it does lag a little bit sometimes which i can deal with but  i know that when i get android 4.2 on it that it will be better so im not worried. And also i am making my friends jealous with this and now they want one (they also say its better than an ipad).SUMMARY:This is an extremely productive tablet that could be used for school or a business or anything that involves paper and other places that need to be more productive. I highly recommend it to students for its ability to take notes, both given to you and hand written notes. It has an awesome function ability to help with upper level math. Also the smart remote is just one of the many other awesome features.

I can handwrite notes many many times faster than i can type on an onscreen keyboard giving this tablet a distinct advantage when you want to take quick notes of bang out long emails or reviews ;-).  then the ability to free write in SNote allows you to use shorthand, pictures and all manner of pictograms just like you are writing on a piece of paper.

It's a Samsung Tablet that does wonders.  Although it would be probably helpful for an experienced user to root it so that you can get a better control on some of the software or at least try and split some of the program memory onto the external SD card, at 16GB, it's plenty of room for any user.  The screen and build quality is above par and it sure beats carrying a laptop unless you are doing some serious work.  Compared to others, the only other rival tablet in my opinion would be the Asus Infinity (TF700 series) with their slightly faster quad core.  Overall, I like the build on this.  My wife has the older Tab 10.1, so I was a little bias to continue using their propriatary connector-to-usb cord.

Worth noting also is that I was an owner of the new iPad.To sum up my review ahead: 20 days after my infinity arrived, the results are in: I kept the Note 10.1 and returned the infinity.Granted, the Infinity has a higher resolution screen (as does iPad 3) so it makes everything look sharp, but it loses on every other front. Persistent lag issues, quality control problems (I actually exchanged the Infinity 3 times before finally getting one that was \"okay\"), lag again, light bleeding, etc.The Note has absolutely no hardware problems. The S Pen is fantastic. The interface is the only OEM android skin that I actually like. The tablet is smooth and beautiful - I have come to prefer plastic over metal (both have its (dis)advantages though). The sounds on this thing is fantastic too. S Planner, S Note, a plethora of other apps that come with make the tablet experience full. Multiscreen? Heck yes!

I'm also an iphone owner.I had been getting bored with the apple IOS format. While the IOS world does indeed have many many apps..most of the ones I like to use exist in both android and IOS. What apple doesn't have, nor does it seem to have any interest in having, is an actual stylus.The Samsung Note 2 caught my eye first.In my search for the next phone, I realized I needed something that1) save my eyes from eye strain,2) make it easier to work with signing documents,3) have a more customizable interface.The Note series is was the only one out there with a built in stylus. It still is. I was still gunshy to change away from the iphone since I've been using it for the last 4 years. I decided to get a tablet version, the note 10.1 as my first foray into android.I couldn't be happier. The pen has unleashed a desire I forgot I had. You simply cannot write, doodle, sketch, draw...yada yada with your finger. I don't care how many brush apps you have on your phone. It is not the same thing. The note provides an outlet for that. I would argue for many of you that it is a useful feature that you just haven't considered. You can sign things. You can write notes. You can do little reminders. Cognitively, writing and drawing allow us to use our brains differently than if we are typing.One thing I didn't realize I'd like was just escaping the whole \"rows and rows of buttons\" style of interface that the iOS locks everyone into. We get so used to it we don't envision any other possible way of arranging the space. Widgets are so much more customizable than the buttons. Sometimes, in my opinion, the buttons make things harder to find. With widgets, you can assign the relative size you want to the different apps you'd like to see on screen. You'll see.The resolution of the screen is not as nice as the iPad of the same generation as this 10.1. I realize that. I haven't missed it overly much..although I can concede that is a minus. The new 10.1 (2014 edition) addresses that.The only thing I wish I could get working on this tablet that hasn't been a success is Amazon Instant Video. That's more an issue with android period. Amazon is just not cooperating on getting their software to support it. Netflix works beautifully.The battery life could be better. I think the next generation tablet from this one improves on that.I'm happy enough with my purchase that I think I can avoid the 2014 upgrade...even though I know it is big step up.

Also, I use both google calendar and Lotus Notes to schedule meetings and possible work at the clients' facilities and email messaging, both these services sync seamlessly with my smartphone (a samsung Galaxy Note 1) .Since I tend to write down a lot of notes during meetings, the stylus was a feature I was pumped for in this tablet, and I have to say it is the closest you can get to pen and paper without having to invest in more expensive wacom digitizers. Another great feature on this tablet is the fact that I can sync the notes I take using the S Note app with my smartphone instantly, so even if I leave the tablet at home I still carry all my meeting data with me.As a media consumption/entertainment device the Note 10.1 is very good but not the greatest.On the plus side, the Note10.1 comes with the PEEL remote app which lets you sync the tablet with your TV and DVR and it works as an universal remote. It has access to both google play video, google play music and samsung media hub right out of the box; it also supports DLNA.A great hardware feature found on this and all 10 inch samsung tablets is the placement of stereo speakers on both sides of the tablet facing the user, and not on the back like most vendors tend to place them, this makes harder for the user to block them while holding the device and projects the sound better.The tablet also comes with a microSD expansion slot up to 32GB so you have a generous amount of space for music and HD video.What hampers this tablet media capabilities however: it's screen resolution (a weak 1280x800 versus the 1920x1200 of the Asus Transformer Prime, which also offers microSD expansion capabilities).So, if you are looking for a solid 10 inch productivity tablet with a solid performance and good media consumption capabilities, this is a great choice, if you are, however, in the market for an entertainment tablet then the choice should go to either the Asus Transformer Prime or Nexus 10 on the Android side of things or the iPad Retina on the iOS side.", "Date": "June 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Galaxy Note 10.1 Tablet is Awesome", "Author": "graphics gal \"Lynne\u00e1\"", "ReviewID": "R1J9XLDO18XH9Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Note Tablet is worth the extra cash if you are an artist or aspire to be.

Our 4-year-old watches videos on this and, with the case we have, it's not possible to stand the tablet up for watching while it's plugged in. The cable gets mashed on the bottom of the tablet. I love having tablets and intend to pick up another Android tablet sometime this year.

Out of those tablets I've used in the past, the iPad came close to being my main device to manage an infrastructure when I'm away but still wasn't a true \"multi-tasking\" device.And then I saw this device and heard and seen the capabilities and I can see myself connected to my email and having my browser up and running on the other end and managing my servers through the browser. Now I didn't get the Note 10.1 from Amazon but through my Vendor but thought I would share my experience anyways.One thing that was a flaw from the moment I opened and turned it on is that my screen had a pretty decent size of a cluster of dead pixels. So I'll be exchanging it immediately. I did think about getting the Asus Infinity TF700 but was hearing LOTS of flaws and Quality of the design.

I decided to go to the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 as I have as of late enjoyed the android interface much more than the simplicity and lack of design Apple puts out.  To be honest, the sanctions against the first tab provoked me to buy it.  I figured it must piss off Apple enough to some degree so I thought it must be pretty good. I couldn't imagine they would go to court over garbage.The tab 2 was nice, but was lacking in hardware so after a few months I upgraded to this one, the Note 10.1I did quickly notice a performance boost as well as improved useability as for the smoothness of the interface.  Things feel less clunky than with the Tab 2.Overall it is very similar; primarily hardware boosted.  I do like the new styllus abilities as well as the opportunity to multi screen.  It doesn't compare to my desktop and 3 large monitors, but it's still nice to have.The device feels a little fragile.  I am terrified of it falling on accident and breaking open.  That is one thing the ipad seems to have over Samsung is the devices seem a little more resistant to trauma.  The backside of the Note seems to have a slight bump in the middle, as if whatever it is inside was to big for the back panel to go on firmly without resistanct.  Not a big deal in my mind, but not ideal either.My ending conclusiong for my brief review is that the Galaxy Note is a very nice tablet.  My only real complaint is the inability to find a nice case for it; everything I find seems to be cheap and/or garbage.It runs nicely, has a pretty good battery 5+ hours, and is pleasant on the eyes aesthetically and resolution wise.I would recommend this as a very good alternative to the iPad.", "Date": "September 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great piece of hardware, but lacks software", "Author": "Adam", "ReviewID": "ROUBUMLW1WO2R", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The good:I love the S-Pen and the precision with which the software recognizes my handwriting.The Split Screen functionality is cool.Being able to make handwritten notes on PDF's and DOCX files is one of the main reasons I bought the tablet, and the tablet works well for this.  I tested out my friend's IPAD (not sure what version) and his device's ability to recognize my writing doesn't even come close to the accuracy exemplified by the Galaxy Note.The bad:No Flash support.  Thus, I cannot watch Amazon Prime TV/Movies, nor can I access some of the other web pages I frequent.  This was one advantage over the IPAD I greatly looked forward to, but Flash is not available on this device.*Update October 19On the FLASH PLAYER:There are several ways to get around not having flash player.  I tried downloading a release of flash from the Adobe site that was supposed to work with Ice Cream Sandwich (the factory install) but couldn't install it.  One of the problems- Every time I clicked on any link/button to install flash, the device would take me to the play store and tell me flash wasn't available.I eventually found an application that requires flash, downloaded it, and let it install flash automatically, thus bypassing all automatic links to the google play store.However, once flash player is installed, it still doesn't work as well as a PC with the sites I frequent (rosetta stone, amazon).  And, what is worse, in order to keep the flash player working, I had to disable the automatic updates for the device.  I had the unfortunate luck of waking up one morning with the tablet telling me it had updated the software, and after this happened no amount of work I could do would get the flash player working again.  So, I restored to factory settings and have not agreed to the TOS of the software update, and my flash player has continued working.MULTISCREEN:The multiscreen option of the tablet is neat, but it has two major drawbacks.  One:  you can only have one window of each of the compatible programs open at a time (so, you can't have two Polaris office items open at once) and there are relatively few programs that are compatible with the multiscreen.  Being able to have class notes open in one window and e-mail open in another is nice.  I can open a PDF with polaris office (although  the PDF reader doesn't have near the quality of interaction with the Spen as the Document reader) and have a google document open with the web browser, but this isn't ideal.  It would be nice to have Adobe and Polaris going at the same time, but this cannot be done yet.Of course, it is easy to switch between active programs, and both Polaris and Adobe remember where you left off, so once I was used to navigating the android device switching between applications wasn't too bad.  Not as good as Alt+Tab, but a close secondBLUETOOTH KEYBOARDI think a bluetooth keyboard is a must.  I have the logitech keyboard/case which is designed for the galaxy tab w/o the SPEN (This was a buying mistake on my end) and it works great with what I have, even if not the way I had originally envisioned.  Until I discovered the \"Null Keyboard\" app, I wasn't happy with the interaction between the two devices because the on-screen keyboard would pop up whenever I tapped a text box.  Now, I can't see working on the tab w/o the external keyboard.AS IT NOW STANDS I am much happier with the device, but still think that the software could be developed more.

The old tablet had its issues with freezing up after the last update along with not enough ram. The note 2 10.1 has twice the ram as the tab model. The continual problems I have had with the note is that the left side of the touch screen lacks sensitivity when using the virtual keyboard. This is a pain when your typing and find out autocorrect won't predict words correctly because it didn't sense you touching the letter selected.Moving on to the S pen. The sensitivity of the pen continually changes. Some of the time it will select the link you are trying to open in a web browser and the other times it will select another link close to the tip because it's not tracking correctly. I have changed tips from the rubber tip to the hard nylon type tip due to the rubber tip wearing out. There are articles online about adjusting the sensitivity but evidently I have the only pen that doesn't respond to adjustments.Samsung hasn't been interested in providing solutions to screen sensitivity along with the pen issues. They said to return it back to sam's club, sam's club says to contact Samsung instead. The finger pointing isn't doing anything to fix the problem so my solution is to use it as a second paperweight and go buy a different brand tablet. I like Samsung and their features offered but customer service needs improvement if they plan to keep customers.Anyone have suggestions for a mid level Ipad that would function for work and personal use?

Prior to that I had played with one for about a week and a half, and I knew this was the tablet for me. I absolutely LOVE it. Writing with the S-Pen is smooth and enjoyable. It's also very enjoyable to use the pen instead of the finger on the touch screen and for typing on the touch-screen keyboard. However, for extended typing, a bluetooth keyboard would probably be better. All in all, I absolutely love this tablet. Google Now is creepily accurate and innovative, and I'm enjoying getting used to the other features. I chose to write this review because when I was considering what tablet to purchase, reviews were a big factor in my decision (then the decision was made for me). I chose to stick with the 10.1\" model rather than the newer 8\" model because I like the bigger screen size, it allows much more room for S-Pen input, and because the 10.1\" model comes with Photoshop Touch pre-installed. The 8\" does not. The 10.1\" also has the same software update as the 8\", so it's essentially the same thing, only bigger. The price is definitely on the high end of tablets, but ultimately you have to consider what it is you're looking for. This is the first tablet I've owned, but I've done a considerable amount of research, and this tablet is the best on the market for stylus input and handwriting recognition.

It is beautiful as well as easy to use. I love how clean and crisp the screen is.  Video viewing is clear and there is hardly any lag when watching videos online.  The sound is loud enough and I don't hear any popping or weird echoey noises.  The stylus is a nice added bonus.  Wasn't thrilled with the idea of having a stylus when I purchased the tablet but is does come in handy when wanting to add those extra writing touches or on drawing apps.  Plus it has a home built right into the side of the tablet where it clicks into place. Haven't played too much with Photoshop touch but it does come with the tablet which is a nice bonus for those who like to play with images.The battery life is not bad..I use the tablet about 4 hours a day and I usually charge it after two days of use...by then it is down to 25% range.  You could probably use it for a full day without having to charge.I do not have a keyboard.  Haven't felt like I needed to spend the extra money on one yet.  The touch keyboard works pretty well.  Spacing isn't too far off a normal keyboard but smaller of course.A few negatives:  Not enough GB space.  I take a lot of videos and pics of my family and of course those take up a lot of space.  Ended up buying a 32GB mini SD card for the tablet which does give me 64 GB which helps.  (I know about the cloud and drop box options but not a fan yet of putting my personal stuff out there.)  Also was upset that it came with no USB adapter. There is only one slot on the tablet. It is used for charging as well as a connector for Memory cards, USB's or anything else you might need to link to the tablet. You cannot charge while you add files!  Do price shop for a USB adaptor! They are way cheaper online than in stores.  The charge cord is a little short.  Maybe 3 feet which isn't much if you want to plug in the wall and sit down on the couch with it.  I tend to charge overnight.Overall a very easy tablet to work with and it feels good in your hands. The Android system is a pleasant alternative to Windows 8 which is a little businessey for me.  I tend to use the tablet more for play than work (games, videos, pics, doodling, web surfing).

As soon as I heard about the Note I knew it was the one for me.Now I write, I write a lot. I've got notepads all over. I prefer writing to typing, it feels more creative...Then I've got to put those notepads into a computer so that I can edit, and maybe just plain read them in a document program.I've always found it very annoying, boring, and full of effort, to have to type up what I've already written.The S Pen is a Godsend for me; Handwriting recognition is amazing, and you can use it anywhere (Any app, and browser, even for URLs. The one thing it doesn't work for is passwords).I've barely used the keyboard since I got the tablet.You can choose the default thickness and color of the Pen, not that exciting but some buyers might like that.I mostly write in Google Drive and I only tried the S Pen programs when I first turned the device on (I don't feel that I need those programs when I can write straight to my document).A couple things to keep in mind, since perfect is too good to be true:It's not as easy to select links in web browsers with the Pen as it is with a finger, sometimes I find myself trying 3 or so times before it selects.Certain things are hard for the tablet to recognize (and it probably depends on your handwriting), I have a less than easy time with quotations, commas, and the occasional letter (it does not like my g's). Most of that is likely because I have atrocious handwriting.It is more accurate with letters and symbols if you're writing a sentence than if you go back to add (it gets my quotation marks usually on the first try when I'm composing a whole sentence)--although it is very easy to edit previous words you've written.Another thing to keep in mind is that when the S Pen is near the screen, it activates (which means that it won't detect touch). I sometimes combine Pen and hand, and don't realize right away that touch isn't working because the Pen in my other hand, which rests against the case, is too close to the tablet.Multi App:Not that much to say about it as I can't test it on many apps. Seems like it works great.The problem that most people complain about -- lack of apps that work with it -- isn't on Samsung's end; developers have to make their apps compatible with the multi app feature in order to use them.There's no telling how many developers will decide to do that, maybe if more tablets are made with that feature?If there's any questions about my review I'd be happy to try and answer them.", "Date": "February 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great in some ways", "Author": "adunbar", "ReviewID": "R3VG1DU0NVCEEB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great device and very useful for teaching and other such tasks.

BUT you can go to the adobe website and search their archives to download flash player manually for the Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0 O/S :) so don't be too discouraged.The other downfall is that it's difficult to organize photos..this just may be because I haven't figured it out yet....so I am going to keep trying!I haven't used any of the other features yet in the 3 days I've had this but once I do I will update my review & let you know!!!!", "Date": "December 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "love it!!!", "Author": "NanD \"NanD\"", "ReviewID": "R3FQQCKNMLN1HL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "GREAT, so much better than an IPad.

The Note 10.1 has a much faster processor and more ram (2GB) than both the Ipad 4 and infinity. It just has more overall capabilities.Oh yeah, and the plastic case that some people are complaining about is not even an issue. Its glossy so it makes it look nice and its ALOT lighter than the Ipad 4 and infinity. I'm coming from a galaxy tab 10.1 so was already used to the plastic casing.You get 50gb of free storage with Dropbox which is an added PLUS.

This is a very capable device and as benchmarks suggest nearly everything is running smoothly on it. I know that most of you are interested to compare note 10.1 with iPad. I also have an iPad and I have been testing many things on both devices. While note 10.1 is better on Google based apps. iPad has slightly superior edge on most of the similar apps (just slightly). But the final word here is the S Pen. If you want to get this tablet for anything except the pen, don't do it and go for other tablets with better resolution/price/etc. However, if you care about taking notes or/and sketching, note 10.1 is a must have. I can not express how much I like taking notes on my note 10.1 and if you want to compare note 10.1 to iPad from productivity point of view iPad is not even close imo. Just try to sketch something on 10.1 and you understand how good it feels. Now I don't need to carry anything except my 10.1 to any lecture that I go to. This will save me a lot of time later for finding the notes too.Cons:- The screen resolution could be better.- Jelly Bean is still not available on it (Samsung recently announced that it will be released on note 10.1 soon).Pros:- S Pen works just great.- Generally smooth and powerful.- Easy to hold and very light/thin.- Samsung S Pen apps (in particular double screen features) are very useful.Overall this is one of the best devices I have ever bought and I highly recommend it for anyone who has any task related to note taking or sketching.", "Date": "August 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Im obsessed", "Author": "Stacey Hovland", "ReviewID": "R32BXGIN59F5OT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 for a whole week now and I haven't found anything that I cant use it for.

I began realizing my iPad was just not very flexible when it came to more than pixels per square inch or how many apps are in the store. It became a huge hassle navigating between 2 apps that I needed open at the same time. It was a pain trying to write with a stylus with a tip as large as my little finger. It took up valuable time having to sign in to the iTunes store every time I wanted a new app or wanted to look at app inventory.The Galaxy Note 10.1 does away with all of that. I can have 2 apps open not only at the same time, I can use both at the same time, on the same screen. May not sound like much but wait until you try it, you will wonder how you ever did without it. The stylus for the Note is one of the main reasons for getting the Note (along with the multitasking). I am \"middle aged\" but in college and I take LOTS of notes. Trying to take notes with an iPad stylus was so frustrating that I gave up after several tries and money wasted on styluses with huge tips and writing that looked like it was done with a giant Sharpie that has a smushed tip. It was typical to get about 8 lines of text on a page before having to open a new blank page in my notebook.The Note's thin tip and adjustable text size really makes taking notes on a tablet truly useful. Going to the app store and loading new apps is totally painless since I never have to login to the store. Also there is the Samsung App Store and Google Play to choose from when looking for safe and supported apps. I can connect other non-Samsung devices to my tablet so I don't have to buy proprietary adapters. I can increase my storage with Micro SD cards or use them to access media I don't want to load onto the Note. The display is fabulous, clear, clean and crisp. Once you reach a certain amount of pixels it doesn't matter anymore. The human eye can only detect so much resolution before improvement stops. I don't know if the Note has a \"retina\" display and I don't care because I don't see how it could get any better. The Note is lightning quick. More so than my iPad in every way. Apps load quicker, apps open quicker, pages switch quicker and on and on.Bottom line is that the Galaxy Note, in my opinion, out does the iPad in just about every arena. The iPad now seems a little childish with it's \"one-thing-at-a-time\" limitations. I have always been irked by Apple's attitude towards the rest of the tech world. They use connectors no one else uses, they don't let the user make any adjustments to anything (especially storage, I hate that), iTunes is such a pain to use with its proprietary format and focus on the app store instead of the user.The Note has really made it useful to have a tablet. The interface and features are geared towards the user, not the company. I can do such much more with my tablet now and I don't get frustrated every day because of what my tablet can't do. The Note does everything and does it all well. I cannot see ever going backwards by getting another iPad.EDIT: It has been a couple of months and I still love the Note 10.1. HOWEVER, there is some sort of ongoing issue with Samsung's cables. My Note stopped charging with both AC charger and through USB. Looking through the Internet I see I am not alone, a long way from it. Many, many users have reported the same issue. I ordered several replacement cables (Note to charger/USB) and a new AC adapter. Using both new adapter and cable my Note charged flawlessly. Used new cable and old charger and it charged, used old cable and new charger and NO CHARGE. The cables are the problem. In fact one of my new cables came with the tablet plug 30 degrees tilted in its casing! Defective before it left the warehouse! Samsung is impossible to contact regarding these issues and when you find a way to contact them you may never get an answer, at least I didn't. So, Samsung's Customer Service leaves MUCH to be desired, BUT the Note is a fabulous device that I grow to like more each day. Be prepared to spend a few extra dollars on replacement cables (order extras when you order your Note) but the device is worth the added expense.", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Delighted by this tablet", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3TUTD6YEY4OLA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've wanted a tablet since the first ipad came out, but couldn't justify the price.

So when I read the reviews (both professional and not) I was a little worried. This product is so polarized.I was concerned about crappy build quality. But my device does not creak or snap. It feels quite solid, similar to the one that I messed around with at Best Buy.  The S Pen is a bit smaller than expected, but I have tiny hands. So far so good.It runs smoother than my two year old smart phone, and is quicker than my Asus EP121. That is all I wanted. I do not think the pen actually has 1024 levels of pressure, having used Wacom tablets for 10 years, but it works well  despite this.My arm tends to bump the menu at the bottom when I am writing notes, but this is a minor annoyance. Also the tablet is only available right now in black at 32gb storage. Oh well. No accessories yet either, at least nothing official from  samsung.I would reccomend this. I think there may be a number of bad units floating around though based on some of the reviews. My experience so far has been great!  I will update this if that changes.EDIT: So after owning this for a couple months now, I'd like to update.1. On the cracking/squeaking: It appears that this comes from the hollow zone where the S-pen inserts. I can now hear creaking when I move the device around a bit or pick it up from this side, but it isn't anything I'm concerned about. It's more noticeable when the S-pen is out but I don't really think it is a problem.2. This thing is great for taking class notes! I love it for my coursework. The software it is shipped with is not so good for writing on PDFs (it's super annoying to import them into S-Note) so I ended up purchasing a 3rd party app that works pretty well. Also the fact that you can't change the default backgrounds easily in S-Note is annoying. But I find myself using S-Note more than the 3rd party app I purchased for notetaking (Quill).3. The screen resolution has not been a problem. Everything looks crisp and nice.4. Battery life is great. I can watch Netflix for around 5-6 hours before I need to plug in. I took it with me to the airport and was able to watch 3 2-hour movies on a single charge. Granted my screen was not on full brightness and I turned off all the extras (wifi, etc). In normal note-taking mode where I am using it for class etc I can get a full class day out of it (at least 8 hours), even with web browsing etc, and still have juice left over to do stuff when I get home without charging!

Although the display is colorful and vivid, the resolution lags other tablets in this price class like the Asus Transformer Pad Infinity and the iPad (3rd Gen).  While I like this tablet, there are many pros and cons to consider.Pros:Speakers: Stereo speakers which face the user make this the best sounding tablet by far!Display: Vivid and colorful IPS LCD screen with no light-bleeding at the edgesS-Pen:  Stylus based on WACOM tech is far more accurate and versatile than capacitive based pens on standard touch screens which adds things such as pressure sensitivity and proximity awareness.  The handwriting recognition tech works remarkably well, but you have to be patient and careful in practice.Features and Customization:  Samsung's TouchWiz UX brings a ton of features and customization, including side-by-side windowing and a pop-out video player.Design: The tablet feels very comfortable in the hand with nice rounded edges.  I also like the two-tone white and silver plastics, the white in particular has a nice pearlescent finish.Specs: Some impressive internal specs with 2GBs of RAMCons:Display: Screen resolution is very low compared to the competition which makes this poor for reading text.Construction: All plastic construction which creeks and flexes to a small degree.Performance: Despite it's impressive specs, the tablet is noticeably laggy in all aspects of its operation.  The complexity of TouchWiz and the variety of features contribute to this problem and might be cured with future updates (Jelly Bean).Camera:  The camera records video in 720p instead of 1080p, and takes mediocre stills.  Many tablet cameras are doing 1080p video.Multitasking: Side-By-Side windowing works only with Samsung apps, and the concept doesn't work that well in execution since you can't interact with both windows simultaneously.", "Date": "September 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "SD card not properly used.", "Author": "Dr.Z", "ReviewID": "R3OSW2EA4QTOX7", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Warning...

I debated between an Ipad and the Note, and the features of the Note wowed me!  The Ipad seemed to me to be rather limited in its capabilities, simplistic, really.I did worry, however, about the comments I had read about the Note's screen resolution, that it didn't measure up to the Ipad's.  Well, I've got to say, that on a 10\" screen, I'm not sure how OBVIOUS a difference there is between the two.  Blow up the screen to a 13\" + size, and, then the difference would be clear.So, the s-pen is fabulous.  Feel it skim across the screen.  A delight!  Still haven't figured out the programs included, but I'm new to the tablet world, so the learning process is a positive challenge for me!I ordered a gel cover for the back of the Note.  From what I read, the glass is quite resistant to scratches.  Will see how the gel works when it arrives.Also, just read yesterday (Oct. 8, 2012), that Consumer Reports gave the Note 10.1 a RAVE review.  That's a comforting sign.So, with that comment, I'll say, do your homework about the Note 10.1.  Go to a store (Best Buy) and play with it.  Compare it to the Ipad.  Which one FEELS right for you?  And if you purchase the Note 10.1, make SURE that the two seals on the box are intact.  (My first purchase had been opened, repacked and sold as a new device!

The Galaxy Note 10.1 has the potential of being the best of both worlds. I can still write my notes with a pen and have them stored forevermore in the Note, unlike all those little slips of paper that tend to get misplaced.The S-Note app, however, is rather rudimentary and buggy. Today, while using the app to make some notes, my handwriting was converted to text but that text immediately disappeared from the page. Also, the app froze the screen a couple of times, requiring a restart of the tablet.As others have mentioned, text formatting options are very limited for text that has been converted from handwriting. If you hand write a few words and then pause, the handwriting is converted to text. You then have to tap the space button. Otherwise, the next word converted will be joined to the previous word. EXAMPLE: You write, \"This is a test of handwriting\" You pause and the handwriting is converted. You resume writing, \"accuracy\". What you get is: \"This is a test of handwritingaccuracy\" I HOPE the next version of the S-Note software will have an \"Auto Space After Last Word\" option. I have to say though that I am impressed with it's ability to interpret my rather poor penmanship.Another feature that I would like is the ability to convert handwriting after the fact rather than on the fly. For example, I would like to hand write a whole page and then let the app convert the whole page to text at once. And I would like to be able to select a portion of a handwritten page and convert just that portion to text.Samsung, are you listening?!?", "Date": "August 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1", "Author": "Ron McCray", "ReviewID": "RD3S9M5JEWE91", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I chose this because of several friends had previously purchased one and found it to be easy to navigate, speed is important and the large screen helps to be easy on your eyes.

My first thought was, as it is for most people, to look into the iPad. Since I have a galaxy phone, I figured it would probably be easier to stick with the same OS so as not to have to buy new apps and start all over. I was glad I did because I came across the Galaxy Note and couldn't be happier with it.Why I love it:-The price: I got it during a lightning deal and paid WAY less than I thought I would for a tablet of this size and specs. As any college student will tell you, saving money wherever you can is a huge plus-The size: I love the 10.1\" display, the resolution is great and while it may not be quite as nice as the iPad Retina display, it looks great for movies, games, and of course school work. The tablet itself is pretty thin and easy to hold for extended use.-S Pen: My main use for this tablet is for taking notes and studying, and the S Pen makes this tablet perfect for that. Normal tablets use stylus that make your handwriting illegible because of the big eraser like tip, but the S Pen allows for fine, pressure sensitive writing that looks and feels just like writing on paper. It also works great for drawing/photo editing if you're into that.-Front Facing Speakers- Im not sure why, but a lot of tablet manufacturers **cough cough-Apple-cough cough** have really neglected peoples desire for front facing speakers. To me it just makes sense that when ever you listen to music or watch videos your looking at the screen so dual front facing speakers like the Galaxy Note's just seem to make sense.-The OS/Apps: Coming from a Galaxy phone I like the set up, but I also want to give a shout out to two included free apps, S Note and Photoshop Touch. S Note is great for taking notes and comes with tons of great features (really good for students) and Photoshop is a whole lot of fun to play around with, even is you have no experience with PS. Google Play has tons of apps to download or sideload so you'll be set with tons of optionsThe One (and only) Thing I Do Not like about it:-The charging cord: This version of the Note uses a proprietary  charging/data cord (included), but it would be nice if it used the standard micro usb as the galaxy phones and many other smart phones. On that note, I believe the 2014 version uses the micro usb cord.Bottom word: Get this tablet! I use it everyday and have never regretted purchasing it. Its a great tablet for the price, a lot of fun, and great for school work, business use or just for fun.

I have a Galaxy S3, so I immediately decided a Samsung tablet would be what I purchased. I would not, however, pay $400 for it (I bought it on a lightning deal for around $340) for a few reasons.No home button - I didn't think this would bother me. Turns out, it does, and I'm glad it's something they included with the 2014 edition. If the screen goes dead, you have to press the power button, and since I have a lock on my tablet, I have to go through that again. If an app freezes (which happens occasionally, but not often) you have to use the power button instead of having a button to return you to the home screen. This is my biggest issue with this tablet.S-Pen is lacking a feature I would have liked, which would be to turn off sensing my fingers/hands/skin. I bought this tablet for note taking and drawing, but it's almost a chore because the screen constantly skips around when I try to use the S-Pen with it because my hand or wrist rests on the tablet as well. It's annoying. I know some app's allow you to turn off the sensitivity, but I shouldn't have to pay $4.99 for something to do what my tablet should.No swype. I know, I know. It's a tablet.

Battery life is doing very well. I am using it for all my lesson plans and seating charts. The handwriting input is great once you adjust to it (took me about 5 or 10 minutes), and the translation to text is quite accurate in both cursive and print. You can use OneNote which I love, and you can create a shortcut to almost anything. You can also run several windows side by side or toggle between full screen windows easily, although the installed broswer does not shrink to run side by side (I installed chrome, which does). So far most things are quite intuitive.Two minor flaws: I wish there was an easier way to go back and edit typed text, I.e. a back arrow that does not backspace. Ifyou mess up, you have to click on the place with your finger or stylus, which gets you close, but with small text having that arrow woukd be nice soyou don't have to poke 4 times to get in the precise spot. The other is that I wish it was a bit easier to move around files, pages, books in s-note. It takes several clicks and was the one thing it took me quite awhile to figure out, but works like a charm once  you get it.Highly recommended!!", "Date": "December 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "ronald metzl", "ReviewID": "R2XLJV7B7SWG2G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love it.

Nguyen", "ReviewID": "R2BBCF6XHBSOUN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let's get the cons out of the way b/c I'm sure that's #1 priorityCons1) Icon text and system text are not clear. Also small text looks like they suffer massive pixel shortage (which is not true).BUT texts are incredibly clear and legible when reading books or watching caption on video, or viewing normal/large/larger text on the website. If you compare those activities with one of those $500 tablets like Ipad Air, Note 2014 or Lumia 2025, they all look the same.2) Awkward positions for control buttons.For example, if you use a tablet case and lay your tablet horizontally, the volume, headphone input, and power buttons will be on the bottom. In other words, you can't use your headphone (unless u flip it the other way), adjust your volume, or turn off/on the screen unless you have to lift up your tablet.3) Proprietary charging/data sync cable. It is not the standard USB micro. It is the Samsung 30 pin or something cable.Pros1) Battery life is longer than the Note 8. I was able to watch movies for more than 4 hours straight.2) Not heavy at all considering it weighs 650 grams.3) Responsive and fast for an old processor. I did not notice any lag when switching between apps or playing game, movies.4) S-Pen is great (don't use the S-pen apps, they are ineffective and inefficient at best). You have to buy the 8 PI S pen to truly appreciate the accuracy of the pen though. The included S-pen is only 6 pi.5) No real buttons. You navigate the tablet using the on-screen buttons. This is incredibly helpful when using with the S-pen and everything else. It really helps you when you are holding the tablet too.Conclusion- I feel that this tablet has so much potential if it wasn't for Samsung failed on the S-pen app and the awkward positions of the volume, power, microphone input buttons. In addition, for some reason the text clarity of the system icon and small texts are garbled. This does not make a good impression on first time buyer especially when they they think a tablet is an Ipad.", "Date": "December 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Quad Core punch !", "Author": "Allin2max", "ReviewID": "R35LF8F1DDSEEL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Samsung had already come out with a 2nd generation Note when I purchased this device, but the quad core processor clearly beats most of the other tablets including the newer Apple device.", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung Galaxy", "Author": "Stephen J.

I will also admit that I was hesitant of the purchase.  I was never a laptop person as I was uncomfortable with it on my lap while I watch the kids.This was kind of a desperation purchase as I needed something I could take outside and room to room as the kids roamed.  I looked at the ipad, galaxy 2 and the note.  My eldest daughter has the galaxy phone and I was always impressed by its performance. And knowing how I multi task my destop to the limit, I decided tge extra cas for the quad vore processor the note 10.1 has was the most likely to satisify.Satisify is a huge understatement.  This is a fabulous machine that even 4 mos later I keep finding new uses for.The processor hums along great with multiple browsers and apps running.  Switching between front and rear cameras is great on video skype one you figure out how to do it and the voice recognition software built in is outstanding.  I would easily pay full price for another of these when the time comes.A few hints.  By nature one of the first things I did was install firefox browser.  Dont bother, ff mobike is nowhere near as good as the desktop.  Get Dolphin browser and chrome, each has a few features thst make them almidt mandatory.Dolphin - as many discover,  android discontinued flash support.  If you play browser games use this.  The dolphin browser will support legacy flash plug-in that let you play browser flash games and online apps like espn fantasy football draft software.Chrome - Chrome has a great feature that magnifies smaller links and buttons.

I got the 32GB Deep Grey one.  The battery life is really great on this.I'm assuming most people get this because of the pen, if you aren't I would advise you to get the galaxy tab 2 10.1 inch.  It's pretty much the same tablet from what I understand, just no pen, and a whole lot cheaper.Now for those of you who want it for the pen...There's some pretty good apps out there for drawing and taking notes.  I'll list some of my favorites I've found so far:*Autodesk Sketchbook Pro- (Paid) I just got this app and have been experimenting with drawing in it.  The canvas sizes are preset and each have a certain amount of layers for each one.  The smallest canvas (which is still pretty big) has 18 layers, which is more than I think I will ever need.  It comes with a variety of different brushes.  I'm still exploring the brushes and figuring out everything.  People have made very beautiful art with this app, and I hope that one day I can too.  I'm pretty sure it was $4.99, you can try out the free version first to see if you like it though.*LayerPaint - (Paid) This is a pretty good app.  You can pick the size of your canvas.  It has an option to \"smooth\" your lines which is nice. It has as many layers as it can handle.  I haven't tested it, but I'm sure that's a lot.*Write  - (Free) This is a great app for taking notes. It has different paper options, like lined, grid, and others.  It uses vectors so it is clear no matter how far you scroll in or out.  The back option is really neat because you can hold your pen down on it and then a wheel will pop up and you can rotate your pen around it to go forwards or back, which is really helpful when trying to erase a word or two.  It also has an insert option that lets you make room for a word and will actually push the words down the lines.  It's really neat and I'm not sure if I explained it that well.  You can export your notes to PDF.  You can change your pen color and size and it has highlighter options as well. The only down side is that you cannot import images to your notes.* I can add more apps if anybody likes, I just got tired of typing descriptions out, but if people want to read them I'll write them.If anybody has any questions feel free to ask and I will try my best to answer!", "Date": "June 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "meesuka", "ReviewID": "R6CQ62586X682", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my Favorite Tab so I'm going to be a little bias but i did buy it and its was new awesome cam with everything, and awesomely ship.", "Date": "June 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent product", "Author": "Manuel Castro", "ReviewID": "R29WUQ7H2H71J5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent product, samsung galaxy note 10.1 is very stable, fast response device, with interesting features spen, 100% recommended, I am totally satisfied", "Date": "June 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just like Samsung cell phones but larger", "Author": "Robin", "ReviewID": "RMQVJVXRX0QK3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really like the display.

I am now assuming. the battery was defective.

After a few months of having the Asus Infinity in my shopping cart, I finally decided on the Note.  And I  am very happy I did.  It is everything I've read about and then some.I will spare the reader from what has already been said.  I will however echo one point I feel is important.  I took some other owner's advice from the reviews and went with a refurb Note.  Saved around $120 which I put into the various items for my Note.  It arrived from the outlet in immaculate condition with all its items, and with all updates installed.  No issues at all.  So, something to maybe consider.I'll also take a second to comment on a case.  I decided to stay with what I know and dropped $90 on the Otterbox Defender case for it also (available on their website).  I have had an OB for all my phones and didn't want to scrimp on this tablet.  Typical OB, it does add girth to the tablet, but I love it.  Two issues though.  One, items like the SD/USB reader don't fit because the case is thick and the reader's connector is not long enough to engage.  Second, the formidable built-in screen protector of the OB drastically cuts down on the S-Pen's sensitivity.  I ended up removing it (easy enough) and going with the normal screen protectors offered on Amazon.  Again, no issue with that. But again, I'm a fan of Otterbox, and this case is no different.So, all in all, I love my Note and am enjoying the daylights out of it.  Can't wait for school to start so I can use it in class.

I was trying to view a pdf and have a word document concurrently open to take notes.  This does not work directly as you have to open/close each to switch back and forth.

The pen is enormously useful for annotating PDFs and image editing.  The included pen applications are very good, and there are some more pen applications in the market.There are some niggling problems.  In many apps, the pen is difficult to use because palm rejection doesn't work or doesn't work well; it would be great if one could disable touch altogether when using the pen.  The plastic case is a fingerprint magnet and feels cheap; you probably want to put it into a case.The Samsung accessory plug is a major nuisance.  You need multiple expensive accessories just to hook up USB host, SD cards, and HDMI.  The plug sticks out the bottom and interferes with cases and stands (you can turn the tablet upside down to avoid that, but then the cameras don't work properly).  You can't just hook up a micro-USB cable for charging, so if you didn't bring your Samsung charger, you're out of luck.  Trying to do multiple things at once (like, oh, viewing camera images on a TV) becomes an exercise in frustration.The HDMI output in particular is nearly useless: it requires an external power source, the HDMI output is in an odd format (a black bar at the bottom) and doesn't work with some HDMI displays at all.  This means the Galaxy Note 10.1 is not a solution for business or academic presentations, since you have to set it up with a rat's nest of cables and then still aren't guaranteed that it will even work.  This really bothers me, because it means I have to take the Galaxy tablet and then another device for giving a presentation; more often than not, I just leave the Galaxy tablet at home because of it.I'm also not particular fond of Samsung's modifications to the Android UI.  If they stuck with standard Android, they'd have a better product.  Unfortunately, Samsung spoils all their tablets with these little problems; they seem to try to imitate Apple and don't realize that many people buy Android tablets because they want standard, open UIs and connectors.  If I wanted to have a completely proprietary \"ecosystem\" and spend hundreds of dollars on accessories, I might as well get an iPad.In the end, if you need a tablet with a pen, this is the tablet to get because the pen is really good.  If you just want a 10\" Android tablet and don't really need the pen, this is still a good tablet, but frankly, you can get better tablets without Samsung's little annoyances from other vendors and pay a little less for the tablet, and a lot less for accessories.", "Date": "September 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "My first tablet experience", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RWGM75SUJRN3U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this for my wife.

The pen has a huge amount of sensitivity to it, allowing for some great lines, from light and sketchy to thick and bold without much effort. Of course, a lot of it depends on the actual program you use that utilizes what the Note is capable of.That being said, there's not a TON of options for programs. I really wish there was something that was comparable to Photoshop, but of course, given that this is not a PC tablet, I shouldn't expect it to be able to run something that powerful. But, I've manage to find 3-4 programs that work pretty well for painting and sketching, so I can't ask for much more.Everything else? It's a tablet.

I was hoping to replace my aging iPad 2. My iPad 2 was experiencing memory issues and couldn't handle running more than one app or browser tab at the same time. I figured the note 10 would be great since it has 2gb of ram, offers real multitasking and the multi apps feature. I had read about people experiencing clicking and creaking with their note 10. I tried 2 of them out and both had this issue. The first was really bad it creaked and clicked all over the place. The second one mostly creaked and clicked around the s pen area and then began doing it on the left bottom corner. I also experienced the wifi dropping on the second note I tried. Then I also found considerable backlight bleeding on the second note. Besides the the defect issues I experienced I found the note 10 a pleasure to use. The note 10 is the lightest and thinnest tablet on the market. I really loved the sound on it with its stereo front facing speakers. The screen was also great looking I didn't even notice that it wasn't 1080p or a retina display. I did find the note to be on the slow side at times I did experience lag. I had about 100 apps installed and 2 widgets on the home screen. I also tried using other launchers asi know touch wiz tends to slow down the device down like it has on my s3. I found the s3 to be slow considering it has 2gb of ram. I didn't like the stock email app which is also on my s3. In order to view an email in HTML format you must first scroll to the bottom of the email then click on load more. I knew that the note had a 16:9 format and thought I would be ok with it, but I didn't like reading or viewing web pages in portrait mode as it was to narrow for me. I much prefer the 4:3 for reading. Although 16:9 is great for video and gaming. I also knew that android has much fewer tablet apps than apple and thought I would just get by without them and use the websites. In the end I missed a bunch of tablet apps I use a lot on my iPad 2. I really missed the flipboard, Facebook, twitter, imdb and pocket apps. The s pen is really cool especially for some one who draws or takes notes. I note much of a stylus person, but I do read that the stylus on the note is the best from any tablet. I also liked the idea of the multi apps feature. It's main downfall is you can't use it with any app you choose. Only selected Samsung apps work in multi app mode. Would be nice if you could use any browser you choose or YouTube or other apps. The peel universal remote was also really cool. It worked with all my devices (2 Samsung tvs, apple tv 2, Sony blu ray). I did experience some issues with the remote but for the most part it worked. One main draw back with the remote is that it wouldn't let control every function of a device. There was also a lack of customization with the controls.  I was also surprised to see there was no s voice on the note tablet. There was the google voice actions which had very limited functionality. Besides the quality control issues I may have actually replaced my iPad 2  completely with the note 10. When comparing this tablet with the Asus tf201 I tried early this year. Samsung has come a long way. This note 10 is much better than the asus tablets on the market now.  This tablet is also a huge improvement over previous Samsung tablets. I ended up buying the iPad 3. It doesn't have as many features as the note 10, but it's easy to use, it's reliable and it just works. I did spend a few hundred dollars more on the iPad 3 than the note 10 but I am happy. I get to use my favorite apps and a higher resolution screen. I may revisit the note 10 gets the jellybean update. I may end up waiting for the nexus 10 tablet to finally get what I want. I also hope Samsung will release more accessories like the keyboard and more cases.", "Date": "September 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Like it...when it works!", "Author": "gg", "ReviewID": "R2BW80YQYZME3C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Made my purchase in February and have had nothing but problems.

I haven't used it at church yet, because it seems so big, compared to having my phone & I don't know that I needed that big. However, I also need to present pictures on it and the 7\" might have been too small for that. All in all I like it and will probably use more as I become use to it.

It's easy to be swayed by the Note, but other than showing off and being happy about its entertainment value and beauty, it's a bit unnerving. Having to learn all its quirks and options (especially with the stylus) requires a long and steep learning curve, there are absolutely no instructions, so prepare for having to google for just about anything a bit more sophisticated you want to do. I had intended to use the Note for my office, to show movie clips to clients and to type notes. That's when things got complicated. While the calendar syncs with my Galaxy S3, Notes do not. And the pre-installed office app does not print to my Epson Workforce printer (it insists it can only print to a Samsung printer), requiring awkward work-arounds that got me really irritated. So, after I bought a 64 gig sd card and a Logitech bluetooth keyboard and a cover for the whole thing (we are now at almost $700), I suddenly realized that this is a lot of money for checking emails, watching Netflix and browsing the Internet. I returned the Note and all its accessories - for that kind of money, it needs to do more: offer a keyboard, a cover or sleeve, and allow to print to any printer (I believe since addressed with Android Kitkat). If you have money to spend and want a great looking toy with a brilliant screen and value entertainment over productivity, I say go for it. All others are better off with something else.PROS: Beautiful, brilliant screen, great sound, lots of features, long battery life, plain fun to useCONS: Hampered productivity, questionable usefulness of stylus, no instructions or manual, very expensiveRECOMMEND: For entertainment purposes absolutely, anything else is a more of an expensive joke really.", "Date": "November 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "6 months later there are issues", "Author": "Keely", "ReviewID": "R2815YKRMNILN8", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Got this tablet for my husband as a gift and for 6 months it was great and he was extremely happy with it.

On paper and specification details it sounds like it should be great. It was actually just OK for me. The pen was cool but didn't really use it as much as I thought I would after the new wore off. The display is OK. It wasn't horrible and it wasn't fantastic. I liked having the expansion capabilities with micro SD card slot but the proprietary dock/USB port was a pain. I was set to keep the tablet but it started to have performance issues. Weird things like when the screen was locked and I rotated the tablet there would be a flash of the home screen or one of the programs running in the background. The audio became occasionally inoperative and the headphone jack would crackle when using my ear buds. I tried other buds thinking there might be an issue with them but it was a consistent result, especially when turning the jack in the port. The OS was fast at first but as I added Apps it got slower and choppy. I did a hard set twice and it came back as fast as new but it would slow again as I added Apps back in. This was a major concern as the tablet could accept a 64gb micro SD card for expansion and would lend itself to installing more apps in the future. I do think Samsung has the right idea about the speakers in the front, genius really! And the sound quality and volume were excellent. At this stage in the game I don't see the need for proprietary connectors. I ended up buying an iPad 4 and my complaint is the same for Apple. I like the Lightning port better than the old 30 pin connector but still, proprietary? Why? Maybe I got one with some manufacturing issues and maybe some of the issues are Ice Cream Sandwich issues that will be resolved with Jelly Bean when it lands for the Galaxy. So, while I returned my Galaxy Note 10.1, I can't say it isn't a great tablet for others. It just didn't suit my likes and desire for a \"Whole package\". Maybe I just bought before it was out long enough to shake out the bugs! I have had 2 other Android tablets in the past, the Acer Iconia A500 and the Asus Transformer TF101. While I liked the Asus better for the screen quality and cool dock the Acer had all the right ports on board and was very durable.

Unfortunately, the screen has amazingly terrible backlight bleeding.This seems to stem from a multicolored spot on the screen that is visible at an angle. It works but in my opinion, $500bucks wasted.New review:Received my refund and a brand new gorgeous grey tablet. Changed my review to reflect my new opinion. My bro has aniPad3 so wherever I mention it, I base it on my personal experience.1. I would have given this 5 stars if I got a perfect unit in the first place. Keep that in mind.2. The screen is excellent. The iPad3 is barely better. Side by side and careful scrutiny is the only way you would  know. Text is nice and crisp, HD movies look great. There has been much talk about ppi. These devices have more ppi  than most desktop monitors. So don't be bothered about IPS comparisons. The screen is fine.2.5. That said, Try the backlight bleed test from the Play Store and you will notice it does have noticeable bleeding.  Not as bad as the unit I returned, but still bleeding.3. The build quality is fine. No it doesn't feel \"cheap\" at all. I realize most Americans hate plastic. Metal is also  superior IMHO but there is nothing wrong with the plastic back. There is no creaking on this, nor was there any on  the unit I returned. Also some people said if you squeeze the back it would touch the board inside. Not true in my  experience. Bought the case from Poetic and well you can't tell what it's made of in a case...4. It is snappy. I will confess that it did slow down gradually with use. Faster once I got the last OTA update.5. The S-Pen is amazing. Handwriting recognition is >90% for me. My handwriting is fairly good though, so mileage may  vary. Bought the \"7Notes\" app and it is amazing. I also dabble in art (I'm no artist) and the S-Pen is great. I must  say, it does almost feel...comfortable, like the real thing.6. Skype is great but it is and always has been buggy for me. The video quality, at least through Skype, is much better  than the iPad 3 for some reason. Skype crashes on any device I use at some point.7. The speakers are loud and front facing, woo-hoo! I still think they could be louder on tablets but this design is a  good start.8. I dislike the proprietary dock. A standard port would have been appreciated for many reasons.9. The camera takes nice pictures. Screen shot function is also good.10. I dislike the screenshot shortcut on the menu bar. Since the last OTA, Power + VolUp also gives screenshot. I want  the option to remove that shortcut.11. Unit takes a long time to charge. Haven't timed it, but I guess maybe 3 hours.12. No issues with Wi-Fi like some people have reported.13. I want Jelly Bean. I have been to xda forums and an UNofficial Jelly Bean update is available for the 3G version.  Dev is also quiet at the moment, they are also probably waiting on JB.With all that I have said here, this is my tablet of choice for a couple reasons:1. It is gorgeous2.

On an iPad the libraries have more books, plus it is easier to highlight and write notes on the them.Overall the device has huge potential with great ideas, but unfortunately I don't believe the software is catching up with the hardware of the device.

It seems that everytime a new tablet comes out like this, set at this price point, people ask \"is this the ipad killer\"? Well no, this one ISNT. Im not an apple fanboy, in fact, I dont own a single apple product, I do own a bunch of android devices though and I have to say from experience, this one isnt too hot. This device isnt worth the price they are asking for it and you are a fool if you buy it a that price.First, there is nothing special about the device. Its an android with a few modifications, such as the stylus input interface and the multi tasking ability. That is, you can have multiple apps running at the same time on screen but at this point, the number apps that are compatible is VERY limited.Second, the advert reads \"Exceptional Performance with Quad Core Processor\". Saying its \"Exceptional\" is a very strong statement. It performs at or near the same level as my Nexus 7. The ads also seems to boast note taking ability on ebooks, but I found that reading pdf still is still shaky as pages take a second or two to render.Third, the bad. As you have probably read from other reviews, this feels like a cheap McDonalds toy. The plastic is a joke. The tablet actually gives a little when hold it. The plastic screeches and groans.One of previous actual \"exceptional\" devices  I owned was the touch pad, which had a plastic back. That is how youre supposed to do it, it was hard plastic that didn't give or make noise when you held it.Unless you can get this in some kind of sale, for like $200, it is not worth it. I actually use my nexus 7 way more than this piece of garbage. If you want 10.1 tablet, wait for the Nexus 10. The nexus 7 is actually an exceptional device and at $200. it would nt surprise me if the N10 was around 300-350. Or get the amazon tablet. All of these awesome devices are coming out at actual competitive prices, who the heck can justify paying 550 for THIS?!", "Date": "September 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cheap plastic", "Author": "ElliotR.R", "ReviewID": "R5BT95X7DXD0C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It is a pretty descent tablet, I will say that. I saw the James Franco commercial and immediately decided to buy it. I cant say I want to keep it though because of a couple of problems that make this tablet a joke.The most significant is the quality of materials. Go online, and look at pictures or videos of the material up close and you will see that it looks soooo cheap. For a $500 tablet, this is inexcusable. The plastic actually bends and creaks when you press it down. I guess that isn't too bad, so long as it works. But at $500, that is a slap in the face. I really believe this tablet wont last at $500 for too long.The second big problem is the screen resolution. It is horrible for this generation of tablets, specially from a flagship product from a company that manufactures the iPad screens. It not aweful screen but its not what you pay for at $500. trust me,DO NOT BUY THIS.*Extra info: I bought this device at a local ELECTRONICS store because I was on the fence about buying it. I wasnt satisfied after using it for a couple of days so I had to return it. Now, I am not saying its not a good device, it is fine. But the two things that are holding it back, in my opinion is the cheap build quality and screen res. If you bought and are saying those are somethings you can overlook or live with, more power to you. But to those people I also ask, wouldnt it be much better, or wouldnt you feel like you got your money's worth more if it had a solid metal backing, or maybe even a better screen res? You cant tell me that the metal would have made it way heavier because I was upgrading from my asus transformer prime, which had an aluminum back and was super light. Also, if you never went a store, just saw the pictures online, you would think that it actually was made of some solid metal. The back has that brushed metal texture look, so you could tell that the designers were going for that, deceptive as it might be. Now you can tell me that its not cheap plastic, that it might even be some super polymer or what ever but to me it felt cheap. And even if higher res screens are overrated, I dont see why a $500 device wouldnt have one.And all of this would be fine if it werent for the ridiculous price tag. My point is just this, for $500, which what HIGH END tablets are going for, I would expect a little better. I had a xoom first, then I upgraded to a transformer primer. But since I am a college student, I really wanted a stylus capable device. That is something this tablet does well, I will admit. My argument is that people shouldnt buy this because I believe that doing so would show Samsung they cant pull this kind of move.
