{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A great device WHEN you consider price and function, with a few flaws", "Author": "Scott", "ReviewID": "RBUNL9QWDYTD7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "UPDATE November 2012 - With the Kindle Fire HD out now, I highly recommend it over this older version, as it fixes many of the problems I mention in my review.  No one should buy this original version of the Kindle Fire unless you can get it for very cheap.  I would also recommend theKindle Fire HD 8.9\" over the 7\" Fire, as I feel the increased size has a dramatic effect on the tablet experience.The first and most important thing that should be said about the Kindle Fire is that this is not an \"iPad-killer.\"  It is not designed to be.  I have seen so many articles and comments comparing this to the iPad, and surveys where people are asked if they will be buying a Kindle Fire over an iPad this Christmas.  If you are expecting an iPad, or even a tablet, you will be disappointed.  The main purpose of this device is to deliver Amazon content to you more effectively.  It is designed for consumption, not creation. That is the reason it is so cheap and why Amazon is taking a loss on it.  They are hoping to make up for that loss through sales of videos, music, books, and apps through Amazon's Web Services.  You can also use it to view your own movies and media, but will find that it is more limited in that way than a regular tablet.  Personally, as someone who has ordered several rentals from Amazon Video, and had to contact customer support for every single one of them due to problems with Amazon's Unbox player or purchases not appearing in my downloads, I can really appreciate this.  But if you don't plan on using Amazon at all to obtain your media, you may want to take this into consideration before purchasing the Fire.  Additionally, the reason this product is so hyped, and one of the reasons I like it so much, is due to the ridiculously low price.  Amazon reviews shouldn't focus on price, but it is hard not to with this device.  On price alone, this is a five star device.  However when looked at the Fire overall, and when compared with other touch devices (what little there is to compare it to), I have to give it four stars, since there are a few areas I feel could use definite improvement.FORM FACTOR - The Kindle Fire feels almost the same in my hand as my 3rd generation Kindle but it is a bit heavier.  It might be difficult to hold it one handed and read a book for an hour or watch a movie. You're going to need to rest it on something.  The display is made of Gorilla Glass, which is a highly damage-resistant.  You can still crack it, but I have used a phone with Gorilla Glass for two years on it and it has zero scratches on it despite being kept daily in my pocket with my keys.  The back of the tablet is rubberized, so it won't slide around and won't get scratched easily.  It also feels good in my hand.  Despite all the companies that will be selling them, I do not think you need a screen protector.  I have scratched Gorilla Glass before, but it is very difficult to do.CONNECTIONS/STORAGE - On the bottom are a headphone port (which will accept external speakers), micro-USB (for charging and file transfer), and power button.  The Fire doesn't come with an SD card slot, with good reason.  As mentioned, Amazon wants you to get content directly from them.  It also reduces the production costs.  You can transfer your own content to the device through the USB connection from your home computer.  The Fire comes with 8Gb of storage, which is enough to hold about 8 downloaded movies, 80 apps, 800 songs, or 6,000 books. I filled mine up right away so I never checked it out of the box, but apparently it is closer to 6.5Gb as the OS is going to take up some of this.  You have to really become adept at managing your content through the Cloud. Books won't take up much room, but magazines are around 250Mb and movies are a little under 1 Gb.  Free videos available through Amazon Prime cannot be downloaded, only streamed.  So unless you buy a movie from Amazon or transfer one of your own, you must be connected through a wi-fi connection in order to watch your movie.AMAZON CLOUD - If you have not tried out the Amazon Cloud Drive, you will be pleasantly surprised. You get 5Gb (which they will probably increase in the near future) of free online storage to store anything you want, and you can access it from anywhere.  This combines very nicely with the Fire.  5Gb isn't much for my collection, so I upgraded to a higher plan (rates are $1 per extra gigabyte per year).  I can upload a playlist to it and listen to it on my home computer, then when I get to work the Fire can access it and pick it up where I left off.  Any songs you get from Amazon Mp3 are automatically stored on the Cloud and don't contribute to the 5Gb storage space.E-READER - This was going to be the big determination in whether I should get a Fire or the new Kindle Touch.  Ultimately I ended up getting both since I prefer the E-Ink technology to the backlit display of the Fire.  If you are the type of person who reads a lot and expect to spend at least 50% of your use on reading books, I don't think you will be satisfied with the Fire over your Kindle 3 or the Kindle Touch, Wi-Fi, 6\" E Ink Display - includes Special Offers & Sponsored Screensavers. It just isn't the same, and after hours of reading, the display would make my eyes hurt a bit (just like with any tablet).  However it is nice not to have to use a lighted cover to see my books in the dark.  The Kindle Fire is difficult to read in bright sunlight or on the beach.  The touch navigation is very nice, but it doesn't function as nicely or quickly as it does on the iPad or even the Kindle Touch. This can be a problem for me, and the main reason I am using the Kindle Touch for reading books. Additionally, the Fire doesn't support real page numbers, even though the Touch does. So you have to use that ridiculous \"location 121 of 16077 - 2%\" format. A year of that with my last Kindle and I still don't understand what that means.  They need to fix this in an update.  Being able to touch a word and have it bring up the dictionary is incredibly convenient and takes less than 2 seconds.  But still, the Kindle Touch handily beats the Fire for reading.MAGAZINES - The Kindle Fire can also handle magazines, however the display is just too small to be an enjoyable reading experience.  I tried out several different magazines, and the main problem I had was with the formatting.  I tried to read an issue of Bon Appetit and my eyes were straining after three pages.  There is no way to read a single article without zooming. The Fire handles magazines two ways: with Page View, which shows the original magazine display, and with Text View, which attempts to just provide the text of the article. A lot of magazines these days have several things going on in one page, with multiple columns, little sidebars and boxes everywhere, etc.  I couldn't view a lot of this without zooming, the text is just too small.  So Page View did not work very well for magazines like this.  It is especially tough with magazines like Entertainment Weekly, Men's Health, GQ, etc.  I found magazines like that unreadable on the 7\" display.  Magazines that focused mostly on the article, like Nature, Wired, etc, were handled much better.  Some magazines even come integrated with embedded video and audio, which is a very nice feature, and one I can see being very useful for things like Men's Health, but I haven't had as much of a chance to use it yet.  Text View is a very nice feature that works mostly well, but seems to get a bit confused with magazines that have complicated formatting, so it pretty much defeats the purpose since those are the ones I need it for the most.COMIC READER - This is one of the main reasons I purchased the Fire.  Amazon has a fairly extensive collection of comic books available for the Fire, including an exclusive deal with DC to publish many of their books.  In addition to a proprietary comic reader that comes on the Fire, Amazon also has a Comics by ComiXology app available to purchase issues and subscriptions through. Although I initially thought the 7\" display would be too small, it is actually decent enough to serve as a comic reader.  I would definitely prefer a 10\" version if they came out with one in the future. A 10\" tablet is still the way to go for comics, but if you're looking for a cheaper option and portability, the Fire isn't too bad, and definitely beats a smart phone.  It has a \"panel by panel\" feature that lets you scroll through the issue by different panels, which it will then zoom in on. You tap the panel when done, and it moves to the next panel.  This is great for getting a larger view and working around the size restriction, especially since some of the text in the comics is just too small to read.  Although it is fairly decent, if you are considering the Fire just for comic books, and you are a Marvel fan, you may want to hold off and look at another retailer's device which I think has a few more options.  You can load your own .cbr comic files on the Kindle, but you'll need to use a third party app, like Comicat to do it.AMAZON MP3/VIDEO - Amazon hopes that you will get the majority of your content from them. That is why the Fire is so reasonably-priced.  Amazon music is DRM-free.  DRM is copy protection.  That means that the record labels haven't locked down the music you buy from Amazon to restrict how you use it.  Amazon MP3 music is playable anywhere, even on your Apple devices.  It also has a very high bitrate so you are getting great quality. You don't have to worry about not being able to listen to your music 15 years from now if Amazon goes under. It's yours forever.  As far as video, I have always disliked Amazon's Video services.  The prices are very reasonable and they now have a huge selection, but obtaining the videos is a huge pain due to Amazon's terrible Unbox player. That changes with the Fire, as everything is native and streams/downloads beautifully.  If you make a lot of purchases with Amazon, or if you have several Amazon customers in your household, you should take advantage of their Prime program.  In addition to the large selection of free videos now available to Prime members, the shipping advantages are amazing. I once had a 200 lb exercise bike overnighted to my house for only $3.99.  Everything I order I get within 2 days. The Prime program seems expensive but it has certainly paid for itself over the years for me, and now is even better that it is integrated more with the Fire.  The only problem I have with video playback is that everything I watched did not fully expand to the screen, and was letterboxed.  Considering the small 7\" display size, this was an annoyance for me.  I know shows have different aspect ratios, but some should fit the display, and I think many users will be annoyed that they can't zoom or stretch the display to fit.WEB BROWSING - This is another feature I was initially excited about. I like the idea of being able to use the Fire as a netbook.  Amazon advertises \"ultra fast web browsing\" using Amazon's Silk browser.  It is based off of technology that is designed to increase page loading times by pre-fetching part of the content.  Sounds like a great idea, but doesn't work as well in practice.  I tried out the Fire on several different connections and compared page loading times with other devices (all connected wirelessly).  The Fire was one of the slowest.  Amazon's own web page, which has actually recently been optimized to work with the Fire, takes an average of 7 seconds to load. Other major portals took a similar amount of time or slower. My iPad and my Xoom both load pages much faster.  It is not slow enough to be a problem, but not fast enough to impress me or be worthy of Amazon's marketing regarding it.  This needs to be improved. UPDATE - As of February 2012, page loading times are much improved. It can still be a bit slow and stutter at times, but you can increase this by following the steps at the bottom of this review.  I am mostly satisfied with browsing now, although Silk still occasionally won't recognize it when I touch a link.BATTERY LIFE - Amazon advertises 8 hours of reading or 7.5 hours of video playback.  As an average, that's probably fairly accurate.  During testing I got an average of 7.4 hours of continuous reading, and 7 hours of video playback over five tests for each.  This is a big change over the roughly 30 days of continuous reading with the traditional kindle, so it may hamper you a bit if you're a voracious reader.  I just got into the habit of charging it every night with my cell phone.  You can shut down the Kindle or put it in sleep mode.  I keep mine in sleep mode all the time because it is so efficient that it uses almost no battery. I can leave it in sleep mode for 2 days and come back and not notice any change in battery life, and since I don't have to reboot, it starts up immediately.VS IPAD - As said, this isn't designed to be an iPad.  I have an iPad and there is so much more I can do with it compared to the Kindle. The Fire serves a different (but sometimes similar) function.  I just don't ever see Amazon building up the type of app store that Apple has, and that's where you're going to find the major differences. Additionally, the 10\" display on the iPad makes a huge difference to me over the Fire's 7\" display when it comes to watching movies and TV, and reading magazines and comic books.  However, I think there is definitely room for the Fire to steal some of iPad's market share, as many people (I am one of them), will find the functions they want in a tablet can be covered by the Fire.USER INTERFACE - The Fire uses a heavily modified version of Android.  I really liked the interface, however I don't think it works as well on the Fire as it does on a full tablet device like the Motorola Xoom.  Occasionally I would try to make a page turn and have it not register on the Fire, or have it register more slowly than I am used to.  If you have a lot of experience with the iPad, you are going to notice that the software doesn't respond as quickly on the Fire as it does with other tablets.  Although this is an inconvenience and something I definitely feel needs to be addressed, I can accept it given the lower price point.  I will have a problem though if this is not resolved through a firmware upgrade in the future.  The Fire's custom version of Android is very nice.  The most recent applications or files accessed will display in a carousel format that you can rotate through.  You can also set up commonly-used applications as favorites. If you want to access movies and pictures that you manually load onto the Fire, you have to open up the \"Gallery\" app, rather than accessing them from the \"Videos\" and \"Photos\" tabs.  The gallery app does not very user-friendly at displaying these files. For instance, it just creates thumbnails for all your video files and doesn't let you view the file names when selecting a video. If you have dozens of videos from a single TV show, there is no easy way to organize them in the gallery. It's clear Amazon wants you to view their videos purchased from them rather than your own. I would really like to see them fix this through a simple firmware update but I doubt they will.NEGATIVES:- No bluetooth and no HDMI.  I could really use bluetooth for integration with bluetooth-capable speakers and so I can use bluetooth audio in my car. As a media player, I feel this really should have been included, and I imagine it will with future versions.  This is especially important since the audio from the speakers is a bit tinny and weak.  I have been using headphones with all my media-playing, which significantly improves the sound. There is also no physical volume button, which is a pain when you need to silence the device quickly (EDIT: You can sideload the \"Volume Control\" app by RubberBigPepper\" from the Android Market for a great software workaround to this).  I also would like HDMI output so I can take my Amazon video purchases and watch them on my TV.  Another big disadvantage in a device that is made for media.  This will also likely be included in a future edition, so at $200, I don't feel bad about possibly having to upgrade a year from now to get it.- Only 8Gb storage space.  As mentioned, this device is mainly designed to integrate with Amazon's Cloud, so 8 should be enough, but it would be nice to have at least 16.  I imagine Amazon did this on purpose to force people to use their Cloud service.- Touch capability can sometimes be sluggish.  iPad and other tablet owners may be disappointed with the touch reaction time and some aspects of the software.- Video doesn't include option to zoom or stretch the display to fit the screen.- Very limited selection of apps from the Amazon App Store. Most of the apps are mediocre games. UPDATE - you can get around this by manually loading apps onto the Fire. Do a search for \"sideload kindle fire.\"  It is very easy.- Web \"Accelerator\" is not as fast as other tablets.- No Micro-USB transfer cable included with it.  Another way for Amazon to discourage you from transferring your own files to the device. If you want to do that, you will need to purchase one separately, like the AmazonBasics USB Cable - 2.0 A Male to Micro B (6 Feet / 1.8 Meters).SUMMARY: Bottom line, you will not find a cheaper device out there for streaming music, video, and books than the Kindle Fire.  The reason that this device is so amazing is not for what it can do, but for what it can do at such a cheap price.  The price tag, not the technology, is the story here.  Although I definitely feel there is room for improvement and will be interested in seeing Amazon's second generation of this device (which I think will be significantly improved), the Kindle Fire is a solid start.  If you can wait a year or more for Amazon to work out the kinks with the Fire (like it did with its 1st generation of the Kindle), you should definitely do that. The next version should fix a lot of the problems that keep the current Fire from being a \"Five Star\" product.  Unfortunately, reviews shouldn't focus on price, so due to some issues with the form factor and touch interface, I can only give it four stars. It is just not \"perfect\" enough for me to say it is a five star product without taking price into consideration.  But aside for that, there is really only one device you can compare the Fire to - The Nook.  So for what it is, I would have no problems recommending the Fire to consumers who can take advantage of it.  This product more than lives up to what it is DESIGNED to do.  If you plan on getting most of your content from Amazon AND you have a Prime membership, I think you will really find this is a pretty incredible device for the money.UPDATE 28 Dec 2011: After getting a new case for the Fire that makes it easier to hold, I'm starting to use it more for reading (although I still prefer my Kindle Touch for anything over about 45 minutes).  Some magazines are now better adapted to the Fire liked my subscription to Wired, and some are still terrible and just compressed PDFs. An update released last week adds more privacy features so you can delete recent history form the carousel, and does improve noticeably on the touch sensitivity, although it can still be frustrating at times and not as smooth as something like an iPad.  Browser loading times are still disappointing, but not as bad as they were at first release, and I don't notice them as much.  I am continually impressed at battery usage for this device. Despite using it less than an hour a day, I never turn it off and only charge it a couple times a week.  The rest of the time it sits in standby mode which is extremely efficient.  If they could improve a couple more options I'd be closer to giving the Fire five stars.UPDATE 7 Feb 2012: I have been able to update the browser significantly by doing the following: Open up the browser and select the menu button at the bottom, select the Settings button, and then change the following options:Enable plug-ins: Change this to \"off.\"  This will disable Flash, so if you have any web sites that need it you can re-enable it (YouTube works fine).Accelerate page loading: Uncheck this. If your wifi connection is decent, it's not really necessary.Mobile (This one is optional, but I prefer to view everything in mobile mode rather than having Silk trying to force a desktop view on a 7\" screen.\"", "Date": "November 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great device, you will enjoy it", "Author": "jjceo", "ReviewID": "RSRZBSOTXHO9U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Update: 12/14/2012If you're interested I just purchased a new second generation Kindle Fire for my grandson and I have done a review on it discussing how it compares to this model and how to set it up right out of the box with a video to help you. I also discuss the new version's pros and cons.  It may be listed a few pages back from the top but you can find it posted with the product link shown below:Kindle Fire 7\", LCD Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offers++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++I picked mine up today at Best Buy.  At home I plugged it in and set up the WIFI and my Amazon account and it immediately told me that an update was downloading.  After about 10 to 12 minutes it rebooted and started working.  I own an iPhone, iPad 2, HP Touchpad and a Kindle Keyboard version.  This device compares with the Ipad.  The reviews that blast the Kindle Fire as being no good are just not true. I am a retired CEO and computer Guru and have a great WIFI set up in my home.  Here is my quick and dirty review:WIFI fast and easy to set up and useKeyboard types great, much better than the HP Touchpad and as good if not better than the iPad.Display high resolution comparable to the iPad 2The device downloaded my 100 books in minutes.  Most books downloaded to the device in 3 to 4 seconds.  A couple of large books took 5 seconds and I am talking about books with 800 pages!Web browsing is extremely fast.  I loaded up a dozen sites that I go to with complex screens and they took 2 to 3 seconds to load.  The people who are complaining should fix their WIFI instead of complaining about the Kindle Fire.  I see no problem and the speed on the sites I tested is comparable to the iPad 2.  One site for a local TV station took about 8 seconds and the screens are complex and contain a lot of videos and changing photos.Apps load and work great, Facebook, Words With Friends and the Weather Channel loaded fast and work quickly.Scrolling works very fast and responsive on the capacitive touch screen.  Better than the HP TouchpadVideo download is very fast and I have no complaints.Sound is very good on the device.  Much louder than on my iPad 2 device.  I saw several reviews blasting the Kindle Fire and in my opinion the sound is better than the iPad 2.I put the Kindle Fire into a case I purchased from Oberondesign and it fit tightly, but it did fit.The Kindle Fire is more portable and easier to hold than the iPad and HP Touchpad.The power button is bad.  It is easy to bump and it is right next to the power plug.  I have already turned the device off 4 times by accident while doing the testing.  I was unplugging the power cable and touched the switch every time.  This switch should have been on the top of the device.Overall the Kindle fire is a 9 out of 10.  For the price it is a 10 out of 10.I am not a professional reviewer nor am I a paid reviewer.  The Kindle fire is worth the money and it works well.  What happens after 5 million users get onto Amazon is a new test that Amazon must prove they can handle.******************************Please look at one of my later comments on an excellent WIFI APP tool than could help you test your home WIFI system. Amamzon sells it and it is free!******************************Update 12-21-2011Amazon has made an update to the Kindle Fire operating system effective today.  Make sure that your Kindle Fire is fully charged or plugged in and press the power button for about 20 seconds.  Turn on the Kindle Fire by pressing the on button again and it will begin to come on slowly.  It will be downloading the update.  After it starts it will shut down automatically and then restart again.  When the swipe arrow comes on, swipe it and enter your password (If you have one) and your Kindle will start. Be patient when downloading this and wait for the Kindle Fire to totally restart!The new operating system is number 6.2.1 and it was 6.2.  You can check this by touching the small gear in the upper RH corner, touch \"+More\", touch \"Device\" and then looking at the entry for the \"System Version\".Major changes that I can see:-Memory is now segmented into two parts that are available to you.  The first is Application Storage which is set at 1.17 GB.  It will appear at the top of the device screen and you can see how much is used for Apps.  This is the memory allocated for your down loaded and resident Apps.- The remaining memory is called Internal Storage and it is now 5.37 GB for your books, movies and other storage besides Apps.  It is listed below the Application Storage.-When looking at the Settings page you will see a new access for \"Restrictions\" which allows you to enable a password to turn WIFI access OFF or ON.  If you enable this you will be asked to enter a password, (Minimum of 4 characters) that will allow you to turn Off the WIFI access.  You have now just enabled a \"child\" mode where you can play games, read books, or do anything that is installed on your Kindle Fire.  You will not be able to get new email, browse the internet, buy anything, or communicate in any way to the Web as the WIFI is turned off.  You will see a key in the upper RH corner where before you saw the WIFI strength indicator.  The key symbol means the WIFI is locked OFF.  DO NOT FORGET YOUR PASSWORD!  Remember you can do anything that is on your Kindle but you cannot download anything from the \"Cloud\" so make sure that your Kindle has everything you want to do on it resident in the Kindle memory.  In order to enable the WIFI you must touch the key symbol, touch WIFI, touch WIFI \"ON\", enter your password and click OK.  Your WIFI will reconnect in about 5 seconds.-You are able to remove anything from the Carousel by simply touching it for a few seconds and then selecting \"Remove from Carousel\".  This is a nice new feature and you can still access your books or Apps by using the menu bar items above the Carousel.- Amazon states that operation fluidity and performance enhancements have be added but it is difficult to see what they are as the device does so much you don't know where to look for the enhancements.-Amazon states that the touch navigation is more responsive and again it is difficult to see changes.  I do seem to notice that the back arrow symbol on the bottom of the screen seems to be more responsive.There is a post on Amazon to download this update using a computer and a micro-USB cable but I have updated two Kindle Fires using the method I discuss above without a problem.  If you would like to look at the Amazon post look here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=hp_k6_updatesi?nodeId=200790620Many people may not own a micro-USB cable.I could not use the automatic update mode where it says to touch the \"Update Your Kindle\" button on the Kindle Fire under the Device page as that selection was grayed out.  Cycling the power to do a hard reset forced the download automatically.  You should receive this update automatically on your Kindle Fire in a day or two after it begins the automatic update roll-out.", "Date": "November 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Outstanding Value at $199 and Full of Functionality / Bells / Whistles", "Author": "Michael Gallagher", "ReviewID": "R27ZIZ754GDA0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had a chance to play with the Kindle Fire for a few hours now, and overall I think it is a great tool /toy when you factor in the cost of ownership and what you get.  Compared to $500 minimum for the introductory price of the bottom of the line iPad2 (WiFi only), at $199 this is a great buy.Using a Wifi connection at two different locations, the speed was pretty fast connecting to the Amazon server as well as to a couple of Internet sites.  I had fast connectivity and display on Fox News, CNN, my personalized Yahoo page, and the website of the International Association of Penturners (hey, I do have hobbies!).  I had slow connectivity at both Wifi locations with Google, ESPN, MSNBC, the Houston Chronicle, and the Weather Channel - I hope the unique app for ESPN and the Weather Channel are a lot faster, but I haven't loaded them onto the Fire yet.  I will point out with the exception of the Google website, those other sites listed as slow are usually slow on my other handheld devices such as my Droid phone and my work iPad2 (yes, the Kindle guy owns and uses an iPad for work purposes).  The web browser is called Silk, and it is nice and user-friendly.Let's talk about what I see as the benefits first:The screen size to me is just right for what I will be using it for - I have used an iPad and the screen is larger - but I did watch about 15 minutes of an episode of season 3 of 24 on the Fire and I didn't have screen envy or felt like I was missing anything.  The sound quality was good, but I listened to it mainly with a set of headphones so I wouldn't wake my kids.Concerning size of the overall unit - not too heavy or bulky and it fits nice in your hand.  I have it in one of the Marware covers and it just \"feels\" right: that's not a firm statement for a review, I know, but what else can I say?  Holding the iPad feels a little bulky at times but the Fire is just a little bit larger than my Kindle keypad, so I was pretty much conditioned to this size over the past few years.  Compared to the iPad, the Fire doesn't generate near as much heat.Speed of the apps as well as reading a book is VERY fast and responsive.  I haven't tried a a challenging spreadsheet or Word document with the Open Office app yet, but then again I can't think of too many times where (based on my guesstimated usage) I will be doing those kind of tasks on my Fire: I like to keep my work separate from play.  Maybe the time will come when business applications will become more prevalent with the Fire, but that's a story for another day.Back to the pricing - $199 is an absolute steal for a unit with this many features.  Compare that to an iPad2 at more than twice the price for a few more inches of screen space.  Some people really want that, but it doesn't bother me.  You will also receive a month free of Prime membership and I highly recommend you try out the benefits, which are more than free two-day shipping.  You get full access to thousands of movies and tv shows for free.  You can give them a test drive on your Fire and see if it is for you or not.  I already rent a lot of movies to my Tivo via Amazon, and I can see the functionality of the free movies combined with the for rent options being able to be played on this device as very compelling for when I go on business trips.And, for those of you I've been playing Words with Friends with, this morning's moves were made on the Fire - the touchscreen worked flawlessly.I transferred some music to the Fire and it works like a charm.  I haven't had enough time to really dive deep into this feature yet and come up with a playlist or jukebox list, but the sounds quality was nice: not too loud and not too soft.Here are some potential negatives:I don't think I will be reading too much on this device.  Who knows, that opinion may change, but I REALLY like the Kindle for reading with its eInk screen.  I read a lot outside or in bright light, and based upon my experiences with reading on an iPad the eInk is better than the full color for reading outside. However, my youngest child really likes the full color resolution as the books he likes to read has a lot of pictures in it (he's in elementary school).  So, to each their own.  I didn't purchase the Fire for reading, but more for entertainment.As mentioned above, the screen is smaller than an iPad.  That doesn't bother me (see comments above), but it may bother some people where size matters or they have to have the \"biggest\" of this and that.I really wish they would have shipped this thing with a micro USB cord: if there is one in the packaging I missed it.  Luckily, I have a few of them in the house, so I wasn't too put out.  I imagine they did that to keep the overall cost at $199.There are lots of apps available for the Fire because it uses the DROID platform, but Apple lovers will pound their chest and say \"but we have over a million apps\" blah blah blah.  I think you should look at the QUALITY of the app vs. the quantity, as there is certainly a lot of junk in the iPad app store (as there is the DROID store), but your basic functionality for the apps I want / need are there.Overall, at $199 this is an extremely great value to me and well worth it: Amazon has hit a home run with this one.  If you haven't grabbed one now, get one before they run out before Christmas!EDIT TO ADD:Okay, I've tried to add this twice and it bombed, so hopefully the third time is the charm.  Email setup was very easy - it took about a minute to setup my main Google account, and I was able to send a test message to another account as well as receive and reply to other emails.  I sent a picture via email to the Fire and it showed crisp and clear.", "Date": "November 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "I want to love it, I really do. But I can't.", "Author": "waetherman", "ReviewID": "R12YEC083C9GWW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "As a long-time Kindle fan I was eager to get my hands on a Fire. For the most part I've found that it does what I wanted it to, which is be the one device I can take with me anywhere. There are some great features; the reader app is excellent (though not without flaws), the app store experience is terrific, videos are fantastic, and the device is quick and for the most part dead-simple to use, all thanks to the services Amazon provides. And of course the extras that come with Prime membership really make it a real value - I won't be cancelling my Netflix streaming account just yet (watching Netflix on the Fire works very well) but I imagine within a year Amazon's free streaming video catalog will be just as good as Netflix. The free \"lending library\" book every month really is the icing on the cake though, and makes Prime membership a no-brainer. The hardware itself is solid and has a quality feel, it's just the right size for one-handed use, and the screen is fantastic (for an LCD screen) with good brightness and excellent color, and a very wide viewing angle. So as a reader, video player and music streaming device the Fire excels, and as an occasional browsing, emailing, game playing tablety thing it does pretty well.But there are some downsides too; the small bezel size makes holding it without inadvertent page-turns difficult, the lack of buttons makes controls harder, the accessible storage memory is limited to just 5GB, which seems awfully small when carrying my own video content on a trip, and overall the interface of the system is just a little awkward and unfinished. Sometimes the back button doesn't work, buttons are hard to push accurately or launch the wrong function, navigation isn't exactly intuitive, etc. Particularly annoying are things like the way that almost half the screen is taken up by menu bars when browsing in landscape mode, the \"momentum\" of the browsing not stopping, menu bars that sometimes just pop up randomly while reading, and the navigation of Newsstand content like the New York Times is incredibly awkward. And then there's the jerkiness that happens when browsing or navigating other content; to me, this just shouldn't happen when reading a book. This is a Kindle, after all.On the missing or unfinished side its disappointing that there isn't even a little bit of social media built in - no sharing clips of books or newsstand material via email, FB or twitter. Also missing is the \"read out loud\" found on other Kindles, and the new \"X-Ray\" feature found on the other new Kindles. There is no archiving or syncing personal documents - they have to be mailed individually to the Fire. And there's no page numbers in the books - c'mon, Amazon, this is even available for the old Kindles at this point. The browser lacks some basic functionality like being able to rearrange bookmarks, and other little annoyances. The email application is very basic, and doesn't always format text properly, and doesn't have simple things like a landscape mode to view a list of messages. But the biggest \"unfinished\" feature of the Fire is the Cloud integration; the Cloud doesn't work hand-in-glove with the Fire in the way you think it might. In order to access features like the video or the docs, you basically have to go through a browser the way you would from any other device. For the most part the Cloud acts only as a digital locker for items purchased from Amazon, not seamlessly as a repository for any kind of content you want to access from the Fire. The way the Cloud seems to be marketed, and the way it should work, is that the Fire and the Cloud should work seamlessly together for all kinds of content; if you upload your own movie from your PC to the Cloud, you should see it in your Video tab on the Fire, and be able to stream it or download it. If you upload folders of work documents to the Cloud, they should be available to browse and download from the Fire's Doc tab. But that's not the way it works. For whatever reason, the Fire's using a Frankenstein mix of the Cloud, Kindle digital library, the app store, and local storage to handle content needs. It just isn't quite ready for prime time, and it isn't what people are expecting when they pick up the Fire.All of these little things add up to make what could be a great device merely adequate. Many will be able to overlook these problems and enjoy the Kindle Fire for what it is; an inexpensive all-in-one-entertainment device. I only point them out to remind people that they should not expect perfection from the Kindle Fire, at least not out of the box. Over the next few months it's possible (likely) that many of the problems I have could be fixed with software revisions - i.e. the bezel problem could be fixed by making the margins in the reader app non-active, for instance, and the problem with the menus taking up too much room could be fixed by making them accessible via swipe-up or swipe-down. Hopefully Amazon is already working on these things. Until then, I'm trying to learn to live with the Fire as best I can. Maybe I can learn to love it.NOTE: This review has been edited slightly since it was originally posted for the purposes of clarity and to answer questions that have come up in the comments thread to this review. Please leave a comment if you need clarification or think that something has been missed.UPDATE NOV 30: a recent software update seems to have fixed several of the above problems, specifically the system speed and page-turning speed are better, and the button response is much improved. Random menus no longer appear when reading, momentum in the browser doesn't seem to be a problem anymore, and the carousel is much easier to use as a result of it having slightly more \"friction\" in paging through the most recent items used.", "Date": "November 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fire - the FAQ", "Author": "A.

Should I buy this model today?A: No. The Fire was a great buy during the year it was launched and shortly thereafter but, as time went by, newer and better tablets became available and Amazon is likely to announce an updated and upgraded version before the end of the year. In the second half of 2012 tablets such as the  Nexus 7 matched the Fire's price and greatly surpassed it in features: faster CPU, better screen resolution, camera, Blue-tooth, GPS, microphone, open to the larger Android world and running the latest version of Android. The best course of action would be to hold on until Amazon announces its new model(s), then make an informed decision.______________________________________________________Q: Do I get free and unrestricted access the Web?A: Yes. The Silk, multi-tabbed browser allows access to just about anything on the Web.Q: Can I store songs, video, photos on the Fire?A: Yes. The Fire has about 5GB of physical storage space. In addition, Amazon offers 5GB of free 'cloud' online storage for non-Amazon media.Q: Is the 5GB of physical storage large enough for, let's say, 50 apps, 1000 songs, 1000 photos and 100 home videos?A: Yes, except for the home videos.Q: Does 'Kindle' indicate that this is a true reader, like the other Amazon Kindles?A: No. The Fire is a customized Android tablet with a backlit touchscreen. While it does come with a Kindle app accessed through the 'Books' tap on the home screen, the reading experience is similar to that from any other tablet.Q: Does the Fire make it easy to access Amazon content?A: Yes. The Fire was designed to facilitate that. You will have easy and immediate access to you Amazon-purchased books, music, video and apps and to their related stores so that you may purchase more.Q: Does the Fire make it easy to access non-Amazon content?A: No. You can transfer and retrieve/play non-DRM content directly into the Fire via an USB cable. Anything stored on Amazon's Cloud that's non Amazon-purchased shouldn't exceed 5GB or you will have to pay a fee for the additional storage.Q: If I have another Android tablet/phone, will I have all the already-purchased apps available on the Fire?A: Yes and No. YES for all the apps downloaded from Amazon's Appstore and NO for all others.Q: Are 'major' apps such as Netflix or Pandora preinstalled?A: No but they are easy, quick and free downloads from Amazon's Appstore.Q: Is the Amazon Appstore the default store for Android apps?A: Yes. And Amazon would like it to be the only store.Q: Do I have access to non-Amazon Android app stores?A: No. Or not unless you are prepared to engage in some serious tinkering. While you can install Amazon's Appstore on any Android tablet from Google's Marketplace, Amazon's Appstore does not carry a Google Marketplace app at the time I'm writing this.Q: Can I install apps from sources other than the Amazon's Appstore?A: Yes but it's not easy. A Fire setting will enable the installing of non-Amazon Appstore apps but, without access to third-party app stores, some skills are required.Q: Are there any Google apps available at the Appstore?A: Not at the time I'm writing this.Q: Is it easy to buy Amazon digital or non-digital merchandise through the Fire?A: Yes, it's very easy. Fire is built to facilitate that.Q: Is it possible to turn off 1-Click?A: Yes and No. 1-Click can be disabled for non-digital purchases but it can NOT be disabled for digital purchases.Q: Can I prevent my kids or anyone else from making purchases while using the Fire?A: You can password-protect access to the Fire itself but, once in, it's impossible to prevent 1-Click ordering of digital content.Q: Are there ANY restrictions I can set?A: You can disable in-app purchases or you can set parental controls with a PIN for in-app purchases if enabled. Post-patch, you can password-protect Wi-Fi.Q: Are 'parental controls' limited to requiring PINs for in-app purchases?A: Yes.Q: Is it possible to make any of my past digital purchases disappear from Fire's 'cloud'?A: No. (According to Amazon's Customer Service rep.)Q: Would Amazon allow me to 'return' digital items that I (or someone else using my Fire) ordered by mistake?A: I was told by a Customer Service person that there is a 7-day refund policy on digital items. Not tested by me.Q: Does the purchase come with any perks?A: Yes. You get one-month free Amazon Prime which translates in free 2-day shipping and access to Amazon's streaming video library.Q: Did the Dec. 20, 2011 patch address all parental control and unrestricted 1-Click issues?A: No. Password-protecting Wi-Fi access does not address these issues because it's an 'all or nothing', crude and ineffective answer to real concerns. Password-protecting Wi-Fi is not a solution to anyone who would like to allow access to most cloud content but restrict or block 1-Click purchases and access to certain categories of content.INTO THE FIRE (SPECS AND FEATURES)Q: Is the Fire display bright and sharp?A: Yes.Q: Is battery life on par with today's expectation?A: About 4 hours of battery life are a little bit less than what competition offers.Q: How does the Fire connect to the outside world?A: Fire is a Wi-Fi device. There is no 3G/4G. You can also connect and transfer connect from a PC/laptop via the USB port.Q: Can the Fire be charged from a laptop or a standard USB charger?A: Not very efficiently. The charger that comes with the Fire is rated 1.8A/5V. Generic USB chargers output a lot less than 1.8A.Q: Does the Fire have cameras?A: No.Q: Does the Fire have a microphone?A: No.Q: Does the Fire have a motion sensor?A: Yes.Q: Does the Fire come with GPS, compass, IR sensors?A: No.Q: Does the Fire have Bluetooth?A: No.Q: Does the Fire have an HDMI port?A: No.Q: Is there any way to pair a physical keyboard, speakers or some display device with the Fire?A: Not at the time I'm writing this.Q: What are the sound output options?A: Sound outputs through the speakers or through the headphones port.Q: Absent volume control buttons, is it possible to control volume through Fire's virtual controls from within an app?A: It depends on the app. Some apps do not allow it.Q: Is Fire's storage expandable through memory cards?A: No.Q: Is CPU performance adequate?A: Yes.KINDLING THE FIRE (my conclusions and rating)I found the Fire to be a good pick for anyone seeking a small, portable interface into the digital content world 'out there', especially but by no means limited to Amazon-provided content. However, for anyone who would like to share their Kindle, the Fire may be a little too hot to handle at this time, especially if you are sharing it with kids or if it's meant to be used by a kid. Please read my note at the bottom of this review for the details. I also listed Fire's other issues with the hope that I may be able to help anyone not sure whether the Fire is indeed what they want.After several months of me and my daughter playing with the Fire I can say that I am generally pleased with my purchase. I will be thrilled once Amazon addresses at least the huge problem having to do with parental controls over Fire-made purchases. I also hope that Amazon open the Fire a little bit more to non-Amazon content sources and... please... I want my Gmail app.The Fire is Okay because it's an inexpensive, easy to use, capable, not fully locked tablet. It makes it easy to buy and 'consume' all kinds DRMed of media, especially that which is stored in Amazon's cloud (free for all Amazon purchases) and I had little difficulty adding my own DRM-free content. The Fire is not a replacement for PCs or laptops but no tablets are. I don't miss an outward looking camera because there are much better alternatives to taking pics with a tablet but a little cam looking at user's face and a mic (video calls) would add significant value to a good product. Then, of course, there are the issues I listed above.I'm going to grant the Fire 3 stars at this time. Three stars mean \"It's Okay.\" My rating could and should improve once Amazon addresses some of the issues I listed above.______________________________________________________NOTE on 1-CLICK PURCHASES (playing with FIRE revisited)It is currently impossible to turn off 1-Click purchases of most media on the Fire. This is quite an issue for anyone who has kids, especially if the user happens to be the kid. The way the Fire is currently set up you are going to get your song or your movie or your book almost the instant you touch them while browsing through the store. This may be okay when you are using a laptop because you can set multiple accounts and make sure that only those authorized can order things but the Fire can be easily shared and I'm not aware of a way that would allow both multiple accounts and the ability to access the purchased media at the same time.To make the story short, it is possible to set some controls but at the App Store only but it's only for in-app purchases. The other media stores: music, movies, books do not allow for any restrictions such as asking for a password or PIN before completing a purchase transaction. The Customer Support person I discussed this verified that this is indeed the case and she promised to forward my feedback to the higher ups. Until then, I am and I will continue to be very concerned. Not that our daughter would knowingly buy the entire Amazon movie library without my permission but that, possibly, one of her friends would do that without being fully aware of what she is doing. Amazon MUST address this or sell the Fire as an 'adults only' product.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! <<", "Date": "November 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "A great device and an excellent value", "Author": "Learn Richly \"Learn Richly dot com\"", "ReviewID": "R396S37QXGBPBZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "SHORT SUMMARY: WHO SHOULD BUY A KINDLE FIRE=============================================The Fire is an all-around excellent device, especially for the price.DO BUY IT, without hesitation, if you want to consume media by yourself or with one other person (max). For example, if you read books and other Kindle content, surf the web, look at photos and want to watch Amazon Instant Videos (Movies & TV) or web-based video sites, then the Kindle will serve your needs well.DON'T buy it if you consume as a group or want to do any creation other than the occasional social media post. Watching movies with many other people is hard (7\" isn't that big), and the lack of keyboard options, Bluetooth, etc., makes this a very focused device that creators will soon tire of. Doing anything with maps is difficult or impossible, as are all the nifty apps that require a camera, so if those limitations are a deal-breaker then look at a Samsung Galaxy Tab (to stay small) or iPad (big and expensive).OVERALL STRENGTHS====================+ The IPS screen is nothing short of fabulous. I've spent several hours staring at it now and am still amazed. It makes my friend's iPad 2 look grainy. Using this as a high-end photo frame on your desk is actually tempting because the colors are so rich. The screen is very close to 16:9 (15.36:9) and fits movies much better than a 4:3 iPad screen, which negates much of the 2.7\" screen size difference between the two (but the reverse is true for old videos that are not widescreen). Overall, the video experience is good enough that you soon become immersed in the movie and you forget about the medium. Plus, since it's so small, you can carry with you more often.+ The overall feel and construction is super-solid. The rubber/silicone backing gives such peace-of-mind; at this price, I don't plan on buying a case for mine in the foreseeable future.+ Compact size. It's about the size of a \"steno\" pad. You can throw it in your backpack, purse, or coat pocket. Overall the Fire is a great balance between usability and portability--much more screen space than a smartphone (at about the same price) but lacking only one typical phone storage option: in your front pocket.+ Simplicity and UI polish of the overall experience is tight. I wouldn't hesitate to give this device to a total tablet novice. This is a great gift idea for even the most technologically-challenged individual.+ Speed is perfectly adequate for anything I've had to throw at it. I've tried at least half a dozen games now and they are buttery smooth. The crisp display and saturated colors make it such a joy to re-examine all my old apps.+ The email client is slick! I have used apps like TouchDown and want to cry because they are so ugly and complicated. Not so with the Fire! Even though this is not a \"creator\" device, I am glad that they didn't skimp on a full-featured email client that actually looks nice.+ Silk web browser! Side by side on the same wi-fi connection vs. my dual-core Android phone, the web browser doesn't seem that much faster. HOWEVER--they were both *very* fast! Keep in mind two things: 1) Silk is taking away bottlenecks, but if your existing wi-fi connection is already super-fast (i.e. no bottleneck), you won't notice the difference. 2) The \"cloud\" improvements will only begin to work when there is a large group of Kindle users who are sending data to Amazon so that they can start proactively caching. It should get faster and faster as more people start using it, so don't feel bad if you're not seeing any speed change out of the box.+ Content, content, content. What sold it for me was the new Kindle Owner's Lending Library. For my $79 Prime subscription I'm getting access to a ton of shows that were are least partially available elsewhere, but no one else is giving away a book a month. I've seen at least a dozen titles I want to read, so my schedule is \"booked\" (sorry, couldn't resist) for a year solid. I was already a Prime member, but had never purchased a eInk Kindle because, so now I will have a \"Kindle Device\" that will qualify me to read a free book a month.OVERALL WEAKNESSES====================-No GPS or Google Maps is a disappointment. I wanted this thing to be a huge GPS to take in the car, but without a GPS chip that can't happen.-No Bluetooth limits its use as a creation device. The $30 Bluetooth keyboard I use for my Android phone is useless for the Fire. Please, someone, make a MicroUSB keyboard that works easily with the Fire or point me to one that already works with the Fire and I'll update this section (I couldn't find any on Amazon).-Lack of hardware buttons was at first a turn-off, but after the tenth time of accidentally hitting the home button playing a game on my Android phone, I now appreciate this minimalist approach taken by the Fire. There's the power-button that you may occasionally bump by accident, but you just need to turn the whole thing upside down and the power button is then at the top--problem solved. The remaining complaint is the missing volume button, but I can also understand the reasons behind that. The original iPod touch lacked volume buttons, but they eventually included hardware controls on subsequent devices.-Content Lock-in. This is the flip-side of the coin for having so much Amazon content. Since there's no HDMI, any movies you buy are going to be stuck on the device unless your TV also supports Amazon Instant Video streaming. I think the strength of selection outweighs this, but it's something to keep in mind!-(Minor) Does not play WMV files. My Android phone does this--why is this codec missing?-Battery life--The specified battery life is really a best-case: you'll want to charge this device at least every other night. It's terrible compared to an iPad 2 and great compared to a typical dual-core phone. It remains to be seen if the competition from the large bricks and mortar book store's new tablet is any better, but on paper they say theirs is longer.CREATIVE USES FOR THE FIRE==========================+ Fitness. Use your new Fire as an indoors exercise companion for treadmills, stationary bikes, elliptical machines, etc. Make yourself a commitment to not watch TV until you've worked-out first (while watching/listening/reading on the Fire, of course). It's the perfect size to strap-on or permanently adhere to your home fitness apparatus. This device and a Prime membership is about the same cost as two months for a personal trainer.+ Schools and home schools. With the number of education apps out there (and ease of development), expect the Kindle Fire to become THE device for kids to use in their studies. This device, in 2011 dollars, is about the same price as my fancy graphing calculator in high school during the early 90s, so we can only guess what kinds of cool education-centric applications will come from this new class of gizmo. For parents, see a variety of great sites (like mine, Learn Richly) that make it easier to evaluate very fun products that make learning a breeze!+ Small business elegance. What if your customers in the waiting room were each given Kindle Fires instead of magazines? How about giving your next sales pitch or presentation as an interactive HTML5 web page that allows your client to engage with the content even as you're explaining it? This also becomes the perfect Kiosk device because it's so open, inexpensive and ubiquitous.+ Lists and reference. Putting a $700 iPad in your shopping cart while you check of grocery items makes me nervous, but somehow I'd feel safe doing that with my rugged-feeling grippy-backed Fire. Use it around the house for the kids' chore chart or as a \"dedicated\" to-do list while at work (what good is the task list in Outlook if I never look at it?)--this price point makes all sorts of things feasible, and especially if you buy multiple devices to establish a community of users in your office or home.APPS INCLUDED & MISSING w/SUBSTITUTE SUGGESTIONS=================================================Built-in you will find already downloaded:+ Kindle Reader App (with more layout options, such as line spacing and margins, than the current phone Android Kindle app)+ Amazon shopping app+ Integrated Music, Video and Web browsing (Silk)+ \"Docs\" tab that takes documents you email to your @kindle email address and puts them in Kindle format+ Audible audio books app (Amazon subsidiary)+ IMDB (internet movie database) app for information about movies, actors, etc. (Amazon subsidiary)+ Contacts app (looks like standard Android with Fire skin)--will sync with GMail contacts and probably others+ Email app with built-in support for Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail, AOL and \"other\", i.e. POP for my ISP worked (not sure about IMAP). Attention:  NO MS EXCHANGE/OUTLOOK :(+ QuickOffice, which is a *viewer* for PowerPoint, Excel and Word--no editing at all+ Gallery app for photos--looks like you'll need a MicroUSB cable and a computer to do much with it, though+ Help & Feedback+ Facebook--seems to be a link to the mobile site+ Pulse--good, possibly great, news aggregator/reader+ Other various popular apps/games that are links (but not already downloaded)--may be trials or ad-supported and you can get them from the AppStore anyway. Thanks for not installing them Amazon! This device is refreshingly free of \"bloatware\"Missing:- Task list & Memo / note- taking--I recommend ColorNote Notepad Notes that has both of these functions- Alarm clock--I recommend Alarm Clock Xtreme Free- Calendar--too many choices to recommend a replacement, but you'll probably get one with a paid Exchange email client- Calculator--I recommend Calculator Ultimate Lite- Weather--AccuWeather for Android or My-Cast Weather Lite both get good reviewsAnything else I've missed? Comments welcome, thanks!", "Date": "November 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "First Impression...It works well as a tablet too!", "Author": "DubStep", "ReviewID": "RPFBB7GHTWO1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This will be a review that will be updated as I continue to use the Kindle.SHORT BACKSTORY: I own a 1st gen Kindle, and despite its original design flaws, I have put it to great use. I am a Prime member. When I saw a tablet(ish) device with a modded version of Android, made by Amazon, with a dual core processor and a smaller, more portable form factor than the iPad for sale at the easy on the wallet price of $199, I pre-ordered immediately.FIRST IMPRESSION: The packaging it comes in is very simple. The Kindle came in a brown cardboard box, which I expected to open and see a Kindle box, but rather opened and saw the Fire itself. Underneath was the Micro USB charger. I immediately plugged it in and fired it up. First thing it asked was to connect to WiFi (it showed every network within at least a 300 ft radius (my office floor is shared with a few others). Connection was hassle free. Then it asked me a few questions, registered quickly with Amazon, and then updated the software. After that 5 minute process, I was free to explore.OS: Intuitive and easy to navigate. A lot of cool little nav helpers come up to explain the various navigational aspects and preloaded apps. It immediately showed all the books in my library.TOUCHSCREEN: Seems very responsive. Keyboard typing was easy enough, especially when laid out landscape. I know other Android devices can bring up different keyboards, so I'll be looking into this.PROCESSING: Haven't opened up anything super intense, but navigating between apps is smooth and doesn't stutter.INTERNET: Took about 6 seconds to fully load a Reuters news page. I've read Silk gets faster with more use, so I'll expect that, but for now, it's definitely fast enough.CLOUD CONNECTION: Awesome. I love everything about it. All my content was readily available and I know my usage of this will go up now that I have this device.MEDIA: I quickly threw on an episode of 24. It looked very crisp and had no trouble whatsoever with streaming. I'll dive into Hulu and Netflix a little later.That's all I've gotten through at the moment. I put this at 5 stars because it MET MY EXPECTATIONS. I read all about this device before buying it, so I knew exactly what I was getting for $199 dollars. It has met all of my expectations of a small form factor tablet that is intuitive, media friendly, and has great processing capabilities. I did not expect an iPad, so there is no comparison in my mind.My next update will go a bit more in depth into EMAIL and Document capabilities as well as exploring some apps. I hope you enjoy this as much as I am!------UPDATE #1EMAILNICE: Email setup is a breeze for GMAIL (including IMAP) and they present a unified inbox view which is nice. However, they don't thread the emails, but that's not a huge issue.BUMMER: Native Email app doesn't support MS exchange, had to download an app. Again, it's not a big deal, but would have been nice to get work emails on this.Sent a PowerPoint Presentation to my personal email and opened it on the Fire. It displayed perfectly in hi res...I am a happy camper at this moment :)UPDATE #1.5APPS: This is my first Android(ish) device and as such my first experience with the Amazon appstore. App store is coming up shallow (in variety of apps) esp. in the finance apps department. That is just my initial response and I may not be entering the right search strings (for finance, I tried Bloomberg, finance, finance apps). I'm SURE as more and more Kindle Fire's come online, the developer community will focus on improving and optimizing more apps.Free APP a day program is very cool and I will be sure to set a reminder to look into this every day.I would gladly take any suggestions for finance (news, stocks, charts etc.) apps or any others.UPDATE #2Loving the Pandora app. And the Cloud player! And just discovered that you can upload UNLIMITED MP3 files to the Cloud just by upgrading to the 20GB plan ($20 annually...). For me, that's over 60GB of music available anywhere + 20GB of anything else. Awesome.UPDATE #3Now that I've spent a great amount of time with the Fire, I can honestly say that I'm very happy with the purchase. It functions fantastically as a tablet device. It could rival the iPad due to the plethora of media streaming options, portability, CLOUD capabilities, flash availability, and basic functionality (but don't set your expectation on this, it IS NOT positioned to be an iPad competitor).I downloaded the TouchDown Exchange app for receiving work emails. The Accuweather app is much more functional than the native Weather Channel app. Thompson Reuters News Pro is a great reader, especially for financial news. Netflix and Hulu + both work very well and I have had no issue in streaming content for both. YouVersion still needs some refining, but it looks great on this tablet.I am starting to realize that the lack of 3g will be a bummer moving forward, but it is not a blocker yet. If the developer community picks up the popularity of the Fire, I will be excited to see a plethora of new apps coming online.Again, overall, I am pleased at how functional this is as a tablet.FINAL UPDATENo issues so far (3rd day of ownership). This thing doesn't leave my side (at home or the office). Amazon's free app a day program is awesome; today downloaded an email app that is normally $10 for my favorite price...free99. My biggest gripe at the moment is that they don't have multiple keyboard options (outside of landscape or portrait). This was available on other tablet devices with Android OS and would make typing a bit easier. But please...for $200, this thing kicks ass.UPDATE (as of DEC. 19th)The FIRE is working great. I stand by my initial 5 star rating.Not thrilled with Amazon's app store, but like I said before, it will get better as more developers come on line. All of my previous comments still stand. Amazon's free app a day program should not be overlooked as its utility has been fantastic. The BEST thing about this is its form factor. I didn't realize how important this was until I found myself carrying my Fire with me everywhere. With the amount I  use it, I'm happy that it is light and almost pocket sized. Battery life seems to be about 5 hours with heavy use, 7.5 with reading. I charge this thing every night along side my iPhone, so it's not a burden.

I had previously purchased the original iPad for my son, but he never used it so I was very worried about spending that much cash for what I feared would be an expensive toy.I was primarily interested in tablets for mobile web browsing, watching some videos now and then (I have a ton of digital movies), and that's about it.  I have a very small music collection, which I've moved to both Google Music and Amazon's cloud storage, so I'm not what you'd consider a big mobile entertainment guy.So far, from the time I've spent with it, the Fire is going to fit the bill nicely.1.

Thankfully, that's not the case.  The text IS a bit dithered (blurry) in some places, which I assume is an artifact of Silk's server-side rendering, but it hasn't seriously affected legibility.  Web videos load pretty darned fast, and the entire browser experience just works.2. VIDEO.  I streamed one of my Amazon Unbox videos as soon as I opened the Fire, and was very pleased with the speed at which the video appeared as well as how quickly the controls just got out of the way so I could enjoy the flick.  It's going to be an EXCELLENT device for videos.3. MUSIC.  The streaming music store works pretty doggone flawlessly.  The only complaint I have so far is that I can't seem to find any difference in the equalizer settings.  Beyond that, since I'm not terribly into music, it suits my purposes just fine.4. BOOKS.  Kindle Fire's weak spot, imo, and the reason I give it four stars.  But to be fair, it was never going to compete with my Kindle 3.  E-ink really is just that much more comfortable to read versus a (relatively low resolution) LCD screen.  Text just isn't that crisp and the backlight actually interferes with legibility.  I've read rumors that the NEXT Kindle tablet (due in 2012) might just feature a dual LCD/e-Ink display or even a Mirasol display, which would remedy this nicely.  For now, though, I didn't expect miracles from LCD and, by golly, I didn't get them. :)5. APPS.  I'm not a big gamer anymore.  (I used to be huge on Gameboy, but I got older and slower.)  The App store, curated by Amazon, is exactly what I though it'd be.  Some might complain about it not having a billion apps, but I really do think everything that the casual user would want is there.  (But if you're not sure go browse it and see BEFORE you buy the Fire.)  As far as accessibility goes, it's easy to get in and out of.As far as the Kindle itself, it's a SOLID little brick.  It's not fancy, nor would I say it has that \"Apple aesthetic\" going for it, but it's a shick brithouse of a tablet.  Amazon might just decide to advertise it as a personal defense device, if they decide the tablet business isn't working out.  It's got a nice, rubberized back.  It is, however, a bit heavier than I expected and is likely to be less comfortable for long-term reading than the (significantly) lighter Kindle 3 or Touch.  The onscreen controls are easy to get to, which stood out to me since I saw some reviews complaining about the lack of physical buttons.Overall, the Kindle Fire is snappy if a little quirky.  I figure it's early and that we've got plenty of time for Bezos 'n co. to tweak the software.  The Silk browser WILL get faster as more users use it--which is the beauty of cloud storage/computing--and in the long run, I really think the whole Amazon/Kindle ecosystem is just plain excellent.  If four and a half stars were available, I'd have shaved only a half a star for the e-Reader functionality, since I knew coming in that it simply couldn't replace my Kindle 3.If you're a Prime member already, this thing's a no-brainer.  If you don't have another tablet and you weren't sure about the costs, it's a great time to get your feet wet.  Amazon's always been incredible about returns if you don't like it, but I think if you're like me and you wanted a good little media consumption device that works pretty intuitively, does the main things you want it to, and doesn't break the bank, the Fire is a doggone great deal for the cash.", "Date": "November 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good value for money", "Author": "Sid", "ReviewID": "R9VFUS9J4GP8N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As an Ipad owner I initially had low expectations for the Fire. However, after having played around with the Fire, I have to admit it is actually quite compelling especially if you are a price conscious buyer. Here's why:- The mp3 apps works real well. I switched to using the Amazon MP3 store fairly recently having used the itunes store for years primarily since Amazon seems to have a larger selection and lower price. I uploaded all my Apple DRM free music to my Amazon cloud drive and now I have access to all my music -  both itunes and Amazon MP3. Unfortunately, some of older Apple DRMed music files do not play on the Fire as expected- The video app is real snappy and I had no issues streaming video at home over wifi. I can honestly say that the Amazon video app is as good as the Netflix app on the Ipad. It seems like the netflix app will be released soon for the fire so I plan to compare them side by side then.- I don't read many books so I can't really provide much useful insight on the book app. I did like on the Fire that the one book I owned opened up on the last page I had stopped reading on my Ipad from months ago. The screen is a bit glossy so that may put some readers off.- The Fire is in general very snappy especially compared to most other Android tablets. Not as snappy as an Ipad but oh so close.- I did notice a slight improvement in page load times in Silk. I am not entirely sure whether that was due to the browser or my internet connection.- I don't like the placement of the power button as I find myself accidently hitting it all the time. The fire is also feels a bit heavy but it is not intolerable.Overall, I feel this is a compelling device for the price and the negatives I stated above are minor to me. If I were looking for a 7\"\" or below $300 tablet, I would say this is the best tablet around. However, if you have $500+ to spend, chances are you would be happier with an Ipad.", "Date": "November 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire Is a True Innovation", "Author": "Megalocke", "ReviewID": "R3SZHBVD50BZGK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought my Kindle Fire yesterday after much back and forth, hand-wringing and consternation over the bad reviews that have cropped up about this device, as well as the media coverage of it having \"problems\" that Jeff Bezos says he is fixing. Here's the thing, I don't know what needs fixed. After playing with the Fire for 24 hours, I can say it is everything I am looking for in a media-consumption device: I can read the Web, listen to music, stream video and enjoy apps. My goal in this review is to debunk, confirm and examine all claims I've read about the Fire.Question Number One: Whose pond are you swimming in? If you're an Apple devotee, who has an iPhone, keeps all your music in iTunes and doesn't care about e-books, no this is probably not the device for you. Save your money and get an iPad, because flat out, you won't like this as much as I do. But if you happen to keep your music in Amazon's cloud, have an e-ink Kindle and an Android phone you will get much, much more out of the Fire. For one, the music in your cloud drive will pop up on your device as soon as you sign in, as will the option to download the books you're purchased on your other Kindle. Finally the app store has many of the Android apps to which you're accustomed.Now let's get down to performance:Let me first say, I feel like the one-star reviews of this device (really anything under at least three stars) are punitive, incorrect and probably people not realizing their Wi-Fi connection sucks more than the fact the browser doesn't work. As mentioned, I am familiar with many of the \"complaints\" about this device, so let's address them.1. The Browser is slow: FALSE - it is super speedy. I don't get the complaints. Awesome. No viability to this claim.2. Volume is too low: FALSE - I would put the volume situation on par with, say, a smartphone. I'd say it is relatively similar to an iPod touch or Android phone. So this complaint just holds no water. I don't know what people expect, but it's plenty loud with headphones.3. Touch interface is glitchy: LARGELY FALSE: The calibration seems like it may be a bit off AT TIMES (maybe, or maybe I'm just not used to the device), but nothing that ruins or even hurts the experience. VERY MINOR. I'm sure Amazon is looking to tighten this up.4. Power Button in Bad Place: FALSE: I don't get it. It's not easy to accidentally turn it off.5. No hardware volume buttons: TRUE It doesn't have any. I thought this would bug me, but here's what you need to think about: This isn't an ipod or a smartphone that you use for listening to music with the device's screen turned off. You're usually listening while doing something else on the device, so adjusting volume on-screen is no big deal.6. Loose with Privacy: TRUE Too easy to buy stuff, the carousel needs to be editable. This needs fixed and I'm sure Amazon will, as they have committed to.There is one con: It's a touch heavy, yet still MUCH lighter than the iPad. However, much like the first gen iPad, I'm sure this will be slimmed down in the next generation, but 24 hours after popping the box open, I'm getting used to it and figured out comfortable ways to hold it over long periods of time.Let's not forget, this device is $199. During the 30 minutes I spent at Best Buy yesterday considering this purchase, I watched eight people walk up and buy one of these. I'm guessing these are moving much faster than iPads. No they don't do as much as an iPad, but if you want to mainly consume media, this device is incredible. Again, I feel like the criticism this device has taken is unfair. It has a couple first-gen issues, but Amazon should be applauded for putting a product like this out rather than taking crap for minor blemishes that do not ruin the experience.Aesthetically, this is a beautiful machine. It is a pleasure to use. I am so glad I got one.", "Date": "December 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Content in the Cloud.

Two on their way back today.I posted a review earlier and want to update.So I got hooked in on this product right away. I upgraded my cloud storage to the 20 gig plan and got unlimited music space also. Already had a prime account. I realized that it didn't have a lot of on board memory. But everything was going to be in the \"cloud\" so I wasn't too worried. So uploaded a bunch of home movies and music videos I had to the cloud. We all like to watch different stuff at the same time at my house so this was going to be a great little device to do that with. I have Hulu and Netflix accounts but like to watch my own stuff too. So the first thing I did upon arrival was fire it up and see how my videos look. Well to my surprise they don't let you watch you own content. The music worked. But no videos. There is another way to get to your cloud. You can see the directories. If you click the music works and the picture works. But videos do not. I know the movie files are in the right format because they work fine in the web based cloud player. So I called CS because I really didn't think this was right. I figured I had something wrong. But sure enough. They told me that playing videos on the Fire from the cloud is not supported. Only videos that were purchased or rented from Amazon would work. Sorry but this was a deal breaker for me.Yes I could put the movie directly on the device. But with only 6 gigs of useable memory It would fill up very quickly. Not to mention. No USB cable either. And it's a micro USB. Not nearly as common.One more strange thing. When I first turned it on. It knew who I was. I never had to log in. It looked like it was preloaded with my profile too.

It's blatantly obvious that the majority of you put no research into buying your tablet. First off, you get what you pay for. It's always been like that. You'd be ignorant to think otherwise.Let's look at this tablet.Reading: It is AMAZING for reading books on the fly (graphic novels look A-M-A-Z-I-N-G); if you turn down the brightness while reading it makes it look almost identical to a \"normal\" Kindle Reader.Volume Control: All of you complaining about the internal volume control must be technologically deprived or something. You literally hit the cogwheel at the top of the screen and there's a huge button that says \"volume\" with an easy to control slider that pops up when you hit it. How much easier could that be? In fact, I wouldn't want external volume control due to how easy it is to bump into them and change the volume.It seems people are expecting this tablet to be their go-to computer on the go, or just their go-to computer in general. I have NO idea why anyone would think this would do that. It's absolutely AMAZING for reading books, browsing the internet, paying your bills, and playing games. The internet is very fast, I think the people complaining about slow internet are just on garbage 1 mpbs connections. Sorry, that isn't going to cut it on Wifi kids.The majority of bad reviews are tablet snobs expecting the Kindle Fire to do something it CLEARLY isn't going to do from the get-go. If you're wanting the equivalent to a desktop on the go look at an Asus Transformer or an iPad or something. If you're just wanting to read, browse the internet, or play games while on the couch or at school or something then this is the tablet for you.Also, 6 GB of storage is plenty. I have like 6 books, multiple games, and a couple of songs and still have like 5.3 GB left. Why would you want to put a full movie on a Kindle? For a road trip? Lol? It's a Kindle, read a book and stimulate your mind.  Like I've been saying, the people complaining about this have are just expecting way too much.I've had this for about 2 weeks. Must have apps:Pandora, Facebook, Stumble Upon, Netflix (WORKS GREAT! Better than I expected, I do have a fairly nice connection though 25 down, 5 up), IMO Instant Chat, TV Listings Guide, Angry Birds, Quick Office", "Date": "December 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very Dissapointed with Kindle Fire and Customer Service, you wont get the same tech twice!", "Author": "Rome", "ReviewID": "R28PXV7V3YUL9A", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I preordered my Kindle Fire as so many other had. I received it on Wednesday, November 16th, and will be sending it back on the 21st!  I recieved the Kindle expecting to be able to instantly use it as I did my daughter's Kindle last year.  I did as it asked and finally got it to connect to my wifi (after a few tries).  It already said it was registered to me, so I didn't have to go through the registration steps.  However, when I tried to look at the user's guide which comes on the kindle (no, you do not get a paper copy), it said \"This application is not registered. Please try again.\" Why would they not send a users guide you can look at while you are trying to learn the device????  Anyway, I could not get any applications to work.I finally decided to call customer service after hours of trying to get it to work.  I even tried to register it online.  I got a customer service rep, told them what was not happening, and they decided I needed a \"Kindle Fire specialist\".  The first rep was nice and tried to walk me through some trouble shooting, and then had me look to see what OS version it was running.  It comes with 6.0, but apparently they already have a 6.1 upgrade.  She had me upgrade the OS as she said she found the problem to be an OS problem.  She told me the Fire had to be 100% charged before I could upgrade the system, so she gave me instructions on how to upgrade it and then to deregister and then re-register the kindle when the upgrade was complete and if I had any problems after that to call back.  Well it took a couple of hours for the kindle to get to 100%, but when it did, I followed her instructions and upgraded the device and re-registered it.  Still the same errors.  By that time my husband was home.  I decided to let him talk to the customer service rep this time since he is more technically savy than I am.  We called back and had to explain AGAIN what was going on with the Kindle.  Got another \"spcialist\" (tec2) who had my husband take it back to factory default, which the kindle didn't do, and then deregister and re-register (again).  My husband talked to him for hours with no resolve.  The only thing the kindle would do is get on the internet. The tech told my husband he would call back the next day (Thursday) around 4.  He also said that if the situation wasn't resolved in 48 hours they would replace my Kindle.  Well, 4pm came and went and still no call.  My husband finally called back and got another \"specialist\" (tech3).  Around 7pm tech2 finally called back.Tech3 told my husband to do the same things the others did. He finally said that he would, \"I need to look into the problem with setting up or registering Kindle fire, and it'll take a bit more time than usual.I just wanted to let you know I'll write back in 2-3 business days with more information.I have your telephone number and the preferred time you want me to call you, so I will get in touch as soon as I have the log from our developers or engineers on how to fix this.\" This must be scripted, because that is what was told to us, but I found this quote on another dissatisfied customers review.Tech2 called me back last night(Saturday) and left a message to deregister and reregister the Kindle again, and to call him if there were any problems.  Well, I did that, and called back the number he called me from, but kept getting \"call cannot be completed, please try again.\"  When a tech calls you and leaves a message to call them back, they do not leave a call back number.  I called the customer support line again and asked for him by name, and they told me that they could not guarrantee that I would get the same tech every time and that they were not sure who he was.  My husband works in a call center and he knows that they should keep logs of calls and should be able to get you to who you want.  Well, when tech3 looked at our case the other day, there were no notes or logs of tech2 having even talked to us. So in comes tech4.My husband made it a point for tech3 to email us his name and case number so we can have something to reference. I told tech4 to look up the case number so she would know what was done.  Well, that did a lot of good.....she had us do the exact same things the others did!!!  By this time I was so frustrated.  We finally told them we were tired of the run around and wanted a replacement.  Well that is fine, but they won't just send you a replacement. They have to expore all options.  I finally got so tired of it I just told them I wanted my money back.  I ordered a cover for it and the extended warranty, and now I have to go through the trouble of getting my money back on those things as well.I have dealt with Amazon for years, and never had a problem.  I think they need to have their techs trained in a product before it comes out.  They kept telling us there were others with the same issues as ours.Hope this helps!", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great as an Amazon portal.  Very poor as a tablet.", "Author": "AM", "ReviewID": "R20CRNSSY3F6E3", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The Kindle Fire is an interesting little toy, but as it stands, it's about half as useful as my phone, even if my phone couldn't make calls. As a portal into content sold by Amazon, it's absolutely excellent. As an Android device, I'm rapidly coming to the conclusion that my G1, the very first Android device, was better.Something that was praised in an early review of the Kindle Fire was that, unlike other Android tablets, it told you what it was for. There was no staring blankly at a desktop, trying to determine for yourself what exactly you wanted the tablet for--something that's been a problem for other Android devices. Instead, you've got a friendly menu at boot: Newsstand, Books, Music, Video, Docs, Apps, Web. There's a carousel of recently used things below that, and a row of favorite apps at the bottom. So, what's it for? News, books, music, videos, docs, apps, and the web, of course! With Amazon ensuring you always have options for the first four of these, it's easy to see what you bought that Kindle Fire for.Unless, of course, that's not what you bought that Kindle Fire for. If your notion was that you'd get a nice, cheap Android tablet for general use, you're going to have some problems. In ensuring that they could provide content to users with zero fuss, Amazon locked much of what Android users think of as \"Android\" out of the Kindle Fire. Android phones, during setup, integrate tightly with your Google account, and a wealth of Google oriented applications are all ready to go with your phone when you turn it on. That's not so with the Fire, and it's not just a matter of extra setup--the thing is locked down. This means no Youtube app, Google+ app, no Google Maps app, no official Gmail (Fire's mail client can read Gmail, but it's not very impressive), no ANYTHING that Google brought to the table for Android, unless you muddle through the web interface, which is really irritating when there's a perfectly good Android app for that.If you don't like their browser (Silk), you can't use a different one. This has already presented a problem for me in the way of trying to use JManga, a portal for manga that's run by Japanese manga publishers directly. This isn't an \"oh, it doesn't work on mobile,\" thing: it doesn't work on Silk. Dolphin, one of the best browsers for Android, handled it fine, but isn't available for the Fire, because Amazon said so. Dolphin is in the Amazon Appstore, and they're perfectly happy to let you have it--but only for your Android phones. It's explicitly blocked from the Fire (and so is every other web browser). You can't go to the official Android Market website to get it either. Try, and Silk will kick you back to Amazon's Appstore.Using Silk to watch videos from sources like YouTube has proven a bit spotty, but doable. When running in the desktop style, framerate problems abounded. Switching to the mobile web based version of YouTube fixed that, but it's awfully stripped down. Again, if Amazon weren't so determined to lock customers out of apps provided by anyone but themselves, this would be a non-issue, as I could just use the YouTube app and have it work fine.So far, I HAVE found an option in the Fire's OS settings to allow installation of third party applications (which is how the Amazon Appstore works on \"normal\" Android devices), but I have yet to find a way of doing so, now that I'm allowed.This is not what it could, or should have been, and the fault lies entirely with Amazon taking a page from Apple's playbook, and trying to maintain an iron fist on the device.", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "I love this thing!", "Author": "William Takacs", "ReviewID": "RO4G3DFCKHFY6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great device for reading, watching videos, playing games, listening to music, or web browsing.

I specifically wanted a tablet (or a tablet-like device) for entertainment on the go - Playing games, watching movies, surfing the internet, and accessing my college e-textbooks (so I could leave the heavy laptop at home)... I also didn't want something that would require another data plan through my cell phone carrier. And, regarding size, I wanted something that was not too big and not too small (about 7 inches), because it wouldn't be too heavy or too big to fit in my purse.After playing with my Kindle Fire for a week, I have to say that I'm not disappointed and feel that the Fire is perfect; everything that I was hoping it would be.I never expected it to be my one go-to item for all of my data consumption -- like: listening to music, watching movies, playing games, reading books, surfing the internet, etc. For starters, I prefer iTunes for music (it's actually the only reason why I have an iPhone), and the iPhone is perfectly suited for music. Using Amazon's Cloud is a great idea on paper, but I refuse to purchase expandable storage (complete with yearly charges) in order to load my collection to the cloud. Nor, am I adding an additional $40 per month to my cell phone bill in order to tether my Fire to my iPhone just to stream music from the cloud when my music desires beckon. Besides, my phone is small enough that it fits in my pocket, or in a workout armband, or in the cup holder in my car... so my music is always at my finger tips.Unfortunately, not only are video files too big to fit on my iPhone, but the screen is also a bit too small to make viewing comfortable. Trying to watch streaming movies on the Netflix app is one thing when you can hold the phone in front of you, but trying to watch something like Transformers while running on a treadmill just gave me a headache. The Kindle Fire, however, is perfect for watching videos on the go. It's not too small to cause eye strain and not too big for my purse (or for the stand on the elliptical at the gym  ^_^). I can download a movie and several episodes of my favorite shows and watch them at the gym when there's no WIFI connection. In fact, I was pleasantly surprised when I downloaded twenty-two episodes of NCIS: Los Angeles and still had room to spare. Videos look super crisp and clear, and downloading was faster than downloading Unbox episodes to my PC!Game play is also great, and I may end up deleting 98% of the games on my iPhone and using only the Fire to play games.Regarding the ebook function - I haven't really used it all that much on the Fire. Due to the battery life and prior experience reading ebooks on my iPhone, I knew that I wouldn't want to use the Fire for reading books. So, I got the Kindle Touch. Both Kindles are so small that carrying them in my purse at the same time doesn't take up a lot of space, nor add a lot of weight. I probably would only read books on the Fire if I were reading at night with no lights on.Does it live up to the hype?In my opinion, for the most part. Especially when it comes to watching videos and playing games.Are there things that could be improved with the next model?Of course. There are always ways to make improvements with anything in life, especially when it comes to a brand new device that is fresh on the market. But, the improvements that I would like to see are by no means deal breakers, or otherwise take away from the incredible value of the Fire. I love my Kindle Fire and never leave home without it.Things that I would like to see improved on the next model:>>More memory. 16gb would be just about perfect.>>The ability to customize...--The ability to customize/change the homepage wallpaper and screensavers.--The ability to customize the tabs and/or create sub-tabs. For example: Under the Apps section, I wish I could organize my apps based on personal preferences, such as: Games, News, and Social Media. At the moment, the can only be organized by \"Recent\" and \"Title.\"**Edited**While this product is now outdated, I have to mention that several months after posting this review, my Kindle Fire found its way into a drawer and didn't see the light of day for a very long time. The apps were worthless to me, and the functions that I used the most, the Video and Web tabs, were not living up to everything I thought they would.I'm sure some of the features have been improved since 2011 in the new Kindle Fire. However, I decided to go with something that could sync with my iPhone for the best mobile functionality.I now have an iPad Mini 64gb Wifi, and couldn't be happier with my new purchase. I've already downloaded the Amazon Cloud Player and Instant Video apps, the Kindle app, and many of the apps that I already have on my iPhone. Coincidentally, the app that I've used most, so far, is the Kindle app. Go figure...", "Date": "November 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "An Objective Look At The Kindle Fire", "Author": "Spiritt R.

One click ordering is activated from day one and there is no way to turn it off. I can see what Amazon was trying to do. They were trying to make it easy to use. It's a mistake on their part. I'll give you that. But in no way a deal breaker for me. Here's an idea. Don't leave the darn thing behind. You're an adult, be responsible.Also try not letting everyone in your world know when you get one. The device is small enough to \"mind it's own business\".As far as your children being able to order thousands of dollars worth of products (another very big complaint), here's another idea. Tell them not to. They can browse but not buy. If they still order thousands of dollars worth of stuff the problem is your parenting, not the Fire.SHIPPED ALREADY LINKED TO YOUR AMAZON ACCOUNT: Again, I can see where Amazon was trying to make it easy. Particularly for people who are new to Tablets and not necessarily tech pros. Again, not a deal breaker.

There is a fix for this so why complain about it?CAN'T WATCH YOUR OWN VIDEOS FROM THE CLOUD: This one broke my heart. I won't lie. BUT! Life goes on. I don't know why it is this way. It just is. But if you're a subscriber to Netflix, Amazon Prime (which everyone is for at least a month), Hulu, and have rented or purchased movies/tv on Amazon, you have PLENTY of videos to watch. But all some people are paying attention to is what they DON'T have.---------------------------------Look people. This thing was $199. The iPad starts at $499. Do you really think you're going to get what you get with an iPad on the Fire? What are you going to do with it. Watch Videos? Surf the net? Listen to music? Check email? It does all of that. And it does it all well. Stop comparing it to an iPad. It's not! The beauty of it is that it doesn't pretend to be. Now if it's consumers would follow suit, you'd be a lot more happy with it.RIDICULOUS Complaints:ANYONE LOOKING AT MY HOME SCREEN CAN SEE EXACTLY WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING: So what! If you've been looking at porn tell them you to get their own if they ask to see it. And if, say, your child was looking at porn, wouldn't you want to know about it? If you're not looking at anything inappropriate here's what you're saying: \"My friend will be able to see that I checked my Facebook status, watched Netflix, and played Angry Birds if they were to look at my Fire\".WHOA!! Alert the media.THE POWER BUTTON IS ON THE BOTTOM AND I KEEP TURNING IT OFF ACCIDENTALLY: Get a case! If you're going to watch videos there are dozens of cases that sit the screen upright so you don't have to hold it. Who wants to hold a tablet while they watch a 2 hr movie?NO DEDICATED HOME BUTTON ON THE DEVICE: Yeah. Ok. The only time the Home button doesn't show up on the screen is when the keyboard is up (just tap the screen any time and you'll see the picture of the house on the bottom left). To get rid of the keyboard to get the home button, you hit one button on the very bottom right. Get over it people. Again, it's not an iPad. Now if you told me there was no home button at all, now we have a problem. But that's not the case.ONLY 8 GB OF STORAGE WITH NO EXPANDABLE MEMORY: And you, of course, have probably heard that after the preinstalled application arrive you're only left with about 6 gb's or so. If you're complaining about this, it's because you've conveniently skipped the flashing lights that this is designed to work with Amazon's vast library. Or maybe you noticed but like to complain. If you're accessing everything through the clouds you don't need to store it on your drive. You just need an internet connection. This essentially allows for infinite storage capacity and, depending on your Amazon Library, Netflix Access, Hulu and other streaming access, you have hundreds of gb's worth of videos on your device. No other Tablet can boast that. Have you tried accessing Amazon videos on your iPad? Try it and let me know what happens.BUT! If you're interested in 64 gb of space, then cough up either $699 for a wifi only iPad, or $829 for a wifi/3G iPad. While you're doing that, I'm using that money to get 3 or 4 of the Kindle Fire and distributing them to my family.I could go on and on but this is probably too long as it is. I love my Fire. I am an avid Amazon user. Real quick, I'll tell you how it saves me money.When I had my iPad I liked to buy Blu Ray movies with digital copies. If they didn't have a digital copy I wasn't interested. This allowed me to watch the movie on my tv (Blu Ray in full HD), the standard dvd usually included allowed people in my household to watch the movie on their non HD TV. Of course the digital copy let me watch it on the iPad.Since all my tv's at home are connected to streaming devices that support Amazon Video and we all have Kindle Fire's, instead of buying a blu ray for $30 to include a digital copy, I buy the same movie on Amazon for $15 and it's already included on all my tv's at home and all of our Fire's, through the cloud.Also I like the portability of the Fire and how it's easier to type on it with two hands than the one hand pecking I did on my iPad.Is the Fire the best product in the world? Not at all. But for the price compared to what it does it is a solid product that you will not be disappointed with. If any of the above complaints were deal breakers for you, get an iPad, Xoom, Galaxy Tab, or a Nook and stop your whining would ya. But then again you'll probably find everything that's wrong with one of those products too.", "Date": "December 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Total disappointment", "Author": "J. schmid \"blueapples\"", "ReviewID": "R3FQXVUSQ08YZC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "(for the record, we have not returned it yet, but I think we probably will, it's her call)We received the Fire on the 16th.  Luckily it was a 'gift' so it wasn't pre-registered.I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend who is a former PC, and now a happy Mac user.  The hype all lead me to believe that this was going to be kind of a cool in-between device between her laptop and her iphone4S. Not at all.  This device feels like something from around 2004. If this was 2004, it would seem really cool.  but it's not.  Here's my list of complaints and observations so far:* power button is in a TERRIBLE spot - the bottom.  we have both accidentally hit the button more than once. But wait - can't you just rotate the device around that the screen will re-orient so the button is on the top?  No.  Oddly, and frustratingly, some apps, will, some won't.  That should be baked into the OS, not dependent on the App!* It gets hot. uncomfortably hot, and only after 20 minutes of use.  and it only gets hot in the bottom portion - where more than likely you are HOLDING it, oh yeah, and accidentally hitting the power button.* touch screen is inaccurate. If you hold the device at an angle in the sun, you can clearly see the spacing of the touch sensors, and then you will know why the touch screen is so dodgy.  they really cheaped out on this with very few sensors.  I get why, for the price point, but with so many apple devices out there, that's GOT TO BE considered the standard now - the iphone Edge came out YEARS ago, no being able to measure up to that is just not gonna cut it.  The credit card signing pad at the grocery store has better accuracy than this.* scrolling is jittery, stutters, and un-even.  So everything has to have scrolling nowadays, but it's a fail on the Fire.  It actually hurts my eyes to try to watch the screen as it scrolls, it stutters and jitters in a very unpleasant way, I can only describe it as a strobe effect.* screen does not dim enough.  come on Amazon - it's a KINDLE!  I'm guessing that more than 1/2 of all kindle users read in bed!  in a DARK BEDROOM.  even at the lowest setting, the Fire is obnoxiously bright for nighttime reading in bed, and not useable as a reader in that scenario.* not a good Ereader, in general.  The Fire screen doesn't even compare to a Kindle Eink screen.  period.* No lock.  seriously.  there no way to password protect the device.  You leave it in a cab, on the subway, a bus, restaurant, where ever, and whoever picks it up instantly has access to your amazon account, and can happily start making charges, not to mention, if you've got email set up on it, all the security risk potential there.  This, in my opinion, is the second most glaring and epic FAIL of the Fire.  Because it would have been SO EASY to have fixed this when they developed the software. (see below for the worst of all)* Multi-touch?  there's ONE multi-touch gesture.  that's it. zoom. and it doesn't work in a lot of places you'd expect it to.  Basic places.  Like Google maps. Seriously?  Isn't this thing running on an OS created BY GOOGLE?!? But no, you have to use the little + and - buttons for zooming.* Browser.  completely fails to live up the the hype Amazon gave it (I watched ALL the demo videos and pre-release reviews I cold get my hands on).  My iPhone is faster on the same wi-fi connection.  But worse that the speed, the browser isn't even full screen.(the top and bottom go unused.  I'm sorry but when you only have a 7\" screen, every little bit makes a big difference.* the 'carousel' GUI.  (graphic user interface).  Okay, this is the big one.  First off, as every other 1 star review has mentioned, there's zero privacy.  When you turn it on, you are faced with a gigantic display of recent activity, on a virtual 'shelf'.  Giant and often poorly rendered icons of WHATEVER 6-10 things you happened to have been doing last on the Fire are there for all the world to see. But what's even worse is this:  YOU CANNOT CHANGE IT.  you can't delete stuff from there, you can't re-arrange stuff in there.  it's just there.  and WAY TOO BIG.  how about a home screen you can customize?  Amazon will tell you that you can use 'favorites'.  But no.  favorites only stack up in whatever order you put them in there - you can't arrange that either.  It really boggles the mind.  what were they thinking?That's all for now.  Hope this helps.", "Date": "November 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Stunning", "Author": "T. L.

Found both email accounts.  Was able to listen to Pink Floyd and surf the web or read.First off-The screensavers are marvelous, those that hate the e-ink ones will be thrilled...LOLVideo playback was smooth and clear.Some reviewers have commented that touching the right part of the screen to go where you want is not easy. If you are used to a smartphone you will not have a problem with the touch screen.Audio- The loudest setting is not that loud, if you are in a quiet room you can hear it 30 feet away. More than adequate for personal use.  If you are around people and want to listen get a pair of ear buds or headphones(we don't want to hear what you are listening to anyway....for the most part).Reading on the Fire--I would not use it for a marathon 6-8 reading session but for normal reading it will be great. It has a good range of font sizes and styles.  My husband could read the largest font size in the skinniest style from 12 feet away.I understand peoples complaints about hiding covers, your archive shows up right away and the default setting is \"by recent\" my most recent was a bodice ripper with a pg-13 cover...ooops.  Collections have been mentioned as a way to solve this, will have to explore it.The 7\" size is great for my hands, this is a solid device with some heft but with the cover I have there is a strap to slip y hand into making holding it easy.  The Ipad, as light as it is, with it size does get awkward and hard to hold in one hand and tap and type with one hand.The smaller size offers more privacy while you consume your media also.My brother sees it as a \"gateway drug\" for the Ipad or a 10\" android tablet.  As in \"this is so great, if only the screen were a little bigger.\" I don't think so, I've tried carrying around a larger, more expensive device.  Was a hassle to dig out of my bag, anyone and everyone could see the screen then you had to dink around getting it back in the bag. You also have to be so darn careful not to smack the bag into stuff like a door. While noone plans to lose it, the cost is alot easier to eat than and Ipad or Xoom and such.I've also carried around my e-ink Kindle, it is very easy to get in and out of a bag on the shoulder, you don't have to be as careful with a smaller bag.If you buy this for the right reasons and know what is does and doesn't have or do you will be happy.***Just wanted to clarify that I could stream music plus read or surf at the same time I had the music going.***", "Date": "November 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Download a free password app", "Author": "Krys", "ReviewID": "R2MF302SM60TB8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I received my Kindle I almost sent it back.

The Fire right now is a neat device at a cheap price, but it's not ready for prime time.The good: it's a low-price tablet with access to lots of apps and Amazon content. Reading books and documents or watching TV or movies normally just works. I wish they'd put a little more RAM in so that streaming was less choppy, but if you have a good internet connection you'll rarely have a problem.The bad: The excellent hardware is let down by the obvious Apple Inferiority Complex in the Amazon Interface Design Department. Put simply, the desire to do \"world winning\" design has led to a lot of annoying interface decisions, such as:1) The Carousel.  Whose idea was it to create an interface that takes up over half of your home screen, cannot be easily customized, cannot be removed and actively makes it harder to start programs? The Carousel has a very hard time differentiating between the a swipe and a tap, so actually launching an application may take a few attempts while you wrestle with your chosen icon. You can't turn the Carousel off, and you can't remove any book that you've purchased from Amazon. In other words, your entire reading history is visible at the swipe of a finger. The Carousel violates so many rules of good interface design that I can't imagine how it got green-lighted.2) No folders. iOS has had folders for a few generations now. Other Kindles allow you to put content into folders. Android allows folders. The Fire? It gives you absolutely no way to separate light reading from serious fare, business documents from leisure content. This makes it particularly less useful as a tool if you have a lot of content.3) Crazy keyboards. Each program appears to be able to choose from a variety of keyboards. Unfortunately, some of the keyboards lack important keys, such as the not-so-commonly-used \"enter\" key. Wunderlist seems to have pulled its app from the Amazon store because users weren't able to add tasks without the carriage return. And it's not the only app that I haven't been able to use because the keyboard lacks a key or two.4) No Google Apps. This one is really inexplicable, like leaving iTunes off of an iPod. The built-in email application reminds me of Eudora circa 1998, and I wish Amazon had spent half as much money on it as they did on the Carousel. If you use Google applications to organize your mail, calendar and contacts, and had the expectation that an Android tablet would synchronize with your life, prepare for absolutely avoidable disappointment.Many of the design decisions appear motivated by the desire to sell content, and Amazon does make it very easy to buy new movies, books and apps. But Amazon has crippled what could be a great multi-purpose tablet. Using the Fire to do anything other than purchase content can often feel like work.My guess is that the next version will address the issues above, allowing users to limit (if not remove) the Carousel, put books into folders, etc. But until these problems are addressed, I'd stay away, because there's no way of knowing if any potential Amazon fix will come in the form of an OS upgrade for the current generation, or the release of a different tablet.", "Date": "December 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "This was the answer to my IPAD envy!", "Author": "Deborah Horne", "ReviewID": "R23CR6SGL5GUS3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received my Kindle Fire 2 days ago and it has surpassed all of my expectations.

I also set-up Pandora. While the built in speakers are not very loud I found with headphones it sounds great!

Absolutely amazing how quickly I got this little bad boy.Pros:-Feels solid to hold. Awesome build quality. Makes me confident it'll take a beating.-FAST. I mean wow. Booted up smoothly, navigates with zero lag. The browser is exceptional.-Intuitive. I own an iPad and a Galaxy tab, but for casual media consumption this interface is going to be hard to beat. It's crazy easy to use.-Cheap. I don't use my tablets for anything but consuming media. After playing with this for a couple of hours I'm having trouble remembering why I paid 500$+ for my other tablets....Cons:-Seems to be pretty locked into Amazon's infrastructure, which will make using it like a normal tablet difficult.-3G would be nice for media consumption. I can tether it to my phone, but for something so focused on being easy to use, that's not a great solution. I would have gladly paid another 50$ for 3G.Comments:-I would pay 100$ more if this had a basic front facing camera and 3G. Hopefully given the apparent success of this they will release a premium model.-For 200$, this does pretty much everything I do on my other tablets. With the small form factor, it's likely I will carry it more places than the other gadgets. Although, at 200$ if it never leaves my coffee table I'll still be happy with it.I'll update this after a week of use, but for now it gets 5 stars for what it is. My cons would be bigger cons if this were marketed as a tablet computer. It's really not though, it's a media consumption device and for that it's exceptional.", "Date": "November 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Perfect For My Needs. Think About Yours Before Buying.", "Author": "J. Figueroa", "ReviewID": "R1R5G05YS7TP5H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had my Kindle fire for about 6 months now; it took me a while to write this review, because I wanted to use this device in all the different settings that fit my life style and my needs for a tablet. Before buying the Kindle Fire, I had considered getting the Asus Transformer, which quite honestly, was extremly tempting, I saw a few online demos of that table playing HD games, it was a beaut; but then I asked myself, do I really need a tablet gaming device? something without controllers, and that costs $600+? the answer was a resounding \"No\".I have a custom built PC with high end components, I have all consoles (hand  helds included) and a smart phone, so why would I spend that much money on an expensive tablet that needs tilting to steer? Again, THESE ARE MY NEEDS, yours will be different and will justify buying a more expensive tablet. My needs were simple...Let me explain, the Kindle Fire covers my basic needs and some more. I basically wanted something I can take with me around the house to shop at amazon, watch videos, e-mail,  going to gameinformer and read reviews, basically, web browsing without having to turn my PC on; maybe the casual game, like angry birds, etc. So now I'll go on to explain some of its features:Built Quality: its weight is balanced. Not too heavy, not too light, I like to feel what I'm holding and the size of this device is perfect for my applications. I like the rubberized back section, which helps when you have sweaty hands, plus adds a bit friction, so you can use some of the Fire covers out there that have the option to place the Fire at a 45 degree angle for movie watching, etc.Video Streaming: I'm a Prime member and have taken advantage of Prime Instant Video, and I have to admit, it is much better than I had expected, the connection was smooth, no hicups, not lag, uninterrupted streaming. I also use Netflix and it works very well, again, no lag or streaming issues. The Kindle Fire handles FLASH BASED videos very well, I go to gametrailers and lot and have not had a bad experience watching trailers, I have also watched videos from YouTube and other sites with Flash videos, they all worked fine. If you want to save your own movies, you have to use a USB cable and your PC.The Web Browser: is surprisingly fast, I have yet to encounter a slow connection or page load. I have gone to numerous sites with more than 4 tabs open at the same time, and each time the Fire handled them with ease. Some complained about it, but I guess, since I upgraded mine right away, I did not nor have I ran into any issues yet. There are some things I would like changed, but I will over them later.Apps: Of course, the only App store available and for good reason, is Amazon's. I have no problem with it, in fact, I have an andriod phone and I barely use the actual Andriod Market maybe once or twice a year, the rest and by the rest, I mean 20+ times a week, is Amazon's App Store. The \"Free App\" of the day is something that keeps me coming back. Anyway, I was able to downloand previous purchased apps (purchased from my phone) into the Fire and they all worked fine, I'm not sure what sort of apps you use, but the ones I do, worked. If you have the Amazon App Store, you know that all  your purchases are saved in the cloud, so you don't really have to have them all on your device at one time.File Transfer (PDF, etc): This is the main concern for many. You should know, Adobe's PDF reader app can be donwloaded for instant file viewing from websites. Files that you need transfered however, what I've done so far is to send them to my kindle email,then simply Sync and view them under Documents. Again, my needs are not very demanding.Reading: The Fire is perfect for reading, I have used the book lending program and have also bought books. All pretty much worked the same as my regular Kindle, except now, with the Fire's screen, I no longer need a light for dim rooms. It has all the font options and now you can also change the background, in case plain white is too bright, which can be, specially in dark rooms.Screen & Sound: The screen is gorgeous, bright and fluid, there's no pixelation and the overall quality is HD by all means. Of course, some video content, specifically from Netflix is not HD (old movies, etc), but they still look decent. All in all, the screen has not let me down, graphics, stills, movies, they all look amazing. Sound is good, not great, but decent, I can listen to movies without a problem, I haven't had the need for more volumen yet, so I can't really complaint.Music Playing/Streaming: it works perfectly. I played music mostly from Amazon's cloud, although we do have the option to load it into the Fire. My favourite feature is being able to LISTEN to music while web browsing. I have zero complaints about the music aspects.Wi-Fi: I'm able to get a signal from my router and joining my home network was a breeze. I have seen the signal drop a few times, but that was my routers own issues. Some have complained about the lack of 3G and free 3G for that matter, but think about it, the original Kindle has free world wide 3G, but because file transfers (books) take a small amount of data transfer, so imagine the cost to provide free 3G to all Kindle Fire owners who would most likely be using the free 3G for video streaming and web browsing; that would not only drive the cost of the device up, but would force Amazon to charge owners for the service. Besides, nowadays, even McDonalds have free Wi-Fi, so we are pretty much covered.Now, there are some things I would like changed and improved, which would make this device that much better, but I'm guessing it would also drive the cost higher than actual. Here they are:1. It would be nice to have a memory card slot, so I can download more movies into the device. With such little space available, I have to decide what to save or not, which can't be restricting, specially if you're running out of space, I know that if I go to a hotel, it is almost certain that a Wi-Fi service will be available, but during the car ride and plane ride, that may not be an option. I can see why Amazon did it this way though, they wanted to promote their video streaming service (Prime)2. A better way to increase/decrease volume would be great, an actual volumen knob or button. At the moment, you have to touch the upper right corner of the screen to have a drop down sort of menu, where you have to chose settings. Adjusting settings this way is no biggie for me, BUT, having to do this to increase the volume? That's a pain in the butt. When increasing/decreasing the volumen, whatever you are watching will pause and continue once you you are done. This drop down thing also has the brightness adjustment.Those are the only two complaints I have. The rest, at least for me, is perfect. Like I said, this device satisfies my needs and more. I don't need a gaming tablet, I have other things for that; I don't need a camera either, I have a smart phone that has one and I have an actual camera.If you are thinking about buying one, ask yourself what your needs are. If they are as basic as mine, for $200 you can have this amazing device and probably be able to buy more than one, which I'm about to do, because my wife, who has a lap top by the way, has started using my Fire for shopping, etc. So there, that's my honest point of view/review after 6 months of constant use. I love the Fire, it has exceded my expectations in every possible way. Amazon has demonstrated that a tablet can be low priced and yet have many of the features more expensive devices have. For Prime members this is an amazing deal, free movies, book lending AND free 2 day shipping. Kudos to Amazon.", "Date": "May 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "NOT A KINDLE & NOT AN iPAD KILLER BUT SOMETHING NEW", "Author": "Margaux Paschke", "ReviewID": "R14IAXUKPBHNRB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was hoping that this could replace a Kindle or be an alternative to the iPad but it turned out to be neither, which isn't a bad thing but means it's yet another devise to add to my \"must haves\" (Kindle and iPad). Great.  At least the price makes it less painful.  Many others have more detailed specs and are more qualified to provide them so I'll stick to my thoughts after spending hours on it.I wish they didn't tag this device a \"Kindle\" which instilled the hope that I could trade in my Kindle DX for the Kindle Fire but the lack of an e-ink display makes it the same reading experience as using the Kindle app on an iPad.  Okay but not as great as the regular Kindle line which is close to reading a physical book and the lack of 3G makes this Fire very affordable but not as convenient as the Kindle.  Also, it does not work as a replacement for an iPad since it has no real working document ability, much smaller screen, no cameras and the apps are media oriented.  I do not think these two devices should be compared.The Kindle Fire does shine as a media tablet and nothing else comes close at this price.  It blows the Nook and other super e-Readers away.  The gorilla glass display is durable and the resolution is very good.  The screen is only 7\" but compares well against other e-Readers and even close to tablets (Samsung Galaxy has 8\" model).  They advertise an operating system of Silk but digging shows Android 2.3; all I know is that it operates smoothly and nothing like other tablets running Android operating systems.  Smooth touch system and screen keyboard.  I found no issues and am very happy Kindle took this direction since switching between Apple and Kindle devices proved frustrating (I'd swipe at the screen automatically and as much as I love my Kindle, it always made it seem archaic with button controls).  It seamlessly provides my Amazon MP3 player, Amazon-on-Demand videos, Netflix, Kindle books, Facebook, Android apps (games) and plenty of cool additions.  My sons really like the comic book option!  It also allows easy import of iTune material.  Yes, the Kindle Fire is Amazon centric just like iDevices are with Apple but at least Amazon is more open and allows non-Amazon material.  Given a choice, I'd pick my music, book and video libraries from Amazon every time over iTunes.  As it is new, I need to test the battery and will provide an update after more usage. Although I will note being unhappy with this charging plug being different from other Kindle devices which were interchangeable.I am less pleased with the fact it only offers wi-fi connectivity, 8 GB option only; and the micro usb port instead of a standard usb port.  I understand the economics behind wi-fi only but it makes this tablet less useful when traveling outside the home and could involve usage fees.  Secondly, Amazon Cloud helps expand storage but at a price.  Offering the first 5GB free (with more available at a reasonable price) and have all Amazon purchases stored free helps but what if Amazon Cloud goes down?  Good luck getting access then and 8 GB fills up quick if you are storing books on Kindle, your Amazon MP3 collection, games and any videos, magazines, etc.  Lastly, having a micro usb port means carrying around an extra cable for use with standard usb ports.  Seriously, who wants to carry around more cables?  which makes this connectivity less useful.  Overall, these are minor when compared to the services and options provided for $199.I am happy with this purchase.  Nothing else on the market can compare to this media based tablet for $199!  And I have tried more than a few.  I wish Amazon wasn't so crafty with their creation of a devise that does not replace either the Kindle or the iPad but the low price point makes it easy to swallow.  If I had to choose just one tablet, I'd lean toward a wi-fi and 3G device but at $199 with no monthly fees, it will appeal to many as the tablet to own.", "Date": "November 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Are You Not Entertained?", "Author": "Philip R. Heath \"Gadgets, Music, & Books\"", "ReviewID": "R1G3FEB4869YHY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Design:  4 StarsFeatures:  4 StarsPerformance:  4 StarsThe Good:* Highly Portable* User Friendly Design* Access to Lots of (Amazon) Content* Exclusive Special Edition Magazines* Strong SpeakersThe Bad:* Occasional Sluggish Responses* Sometimes Touches Don't Register* Few Good Cases (so far)Overall:  The Kindle Fire is a very good device for information consumption and entertainment.  Enterprise users, however, would be better served by one of the many Honeycomb tables available.By now you've probably heard plenty about the Kindle Fire, but I'm to try to give you a balanced breakdown of the user experience.  First and foremost I should establish who the target user of is.  I believe that many of the frustrated owners are those who expected something more than the Kindle Fire has to offer.  It is not a laptop replacement.  It is not an iPad or an iPad killer.  It is really not even the original 7\" Galaxy Tab.  Each of these devices is more full featured and diverse.  The target user of the Kindle Fire wants to consume information and be entertained.  If you are looking for anything outside of these two broad categories, the Kindle Fire is not for you.  However those who are still interested should read on.The good thing about the Kindle Fire is that it starts simple and stays that way.  I bought my own so my account came pre-configured on the device.  I plugged in the device to charge it using the included charger, and I configured my wireless information.  There was already a software update which applied automatically and rebooted the device.  After that I was off to the races.The interface of the Kindle Fire is a highly customized version of Android 2.3 (Gingerbread).  If you have other Android devices, you will hardly recognize the interface, but that is not a bad thing.  Below the global search box the menus across the top give you access to Newsstand, Books, Music, Video, Docs, Apps, and Web. This box takes up about an inch of the display.  About half is used by the Carousel - it is essentially a history of the things you have accessed.  I didn't get this at first, but this serves as a psuedo-app switching feature as well.  If you are in a task, press the home button and scroll through the Carousel to find what you want to switch to.  The remainder of the home screen is a shelf for favorites.  It comes with some apps already selected, but long pressing these brings up a menu that allows you to delete the ones you don't want there.The Newsstand will contain items (newspapers and magazines) familiar to previous Kindle owners, but there's something new - Kindle Fire editions of a subset of magazines.  I opted to give Revolver a try, and I found the experience to be pleasant.  One of the things I didn't like about magazines on previous Kindles was the overly simplified format required by the device.  With Revolver I had an interface that let me scroll page by page through the magazine allowing for full experience with pictures and layout just like the physical magazine.  However this view does not lend itself to reading.  No worries, just tap the screen and you can switch from Page View to Text View.  This gives more of a traditional Kindle view the first article on the page along with pictures.  You can continue to traverse the magazine in the mode or switch back to Page View to flip pages.  Text View does skip pages that are full page ads - so may like this feature.  What's nice is that the Kindle Fire manages to be all things to all people with these exclusive edition magazines.  I hope to see newspapers in this format soon.The Kindle family has historically earned their keep with access to Books, and the Fire is no different.  There's not a lot to say about this feature.  If you've used the Kindle for Android app, you will find the experience very familiar.  If reading is your primary (or only) use, you probably want one of the e-ink based Kindles.  The Fire is not as easy on the eyes, and it is not going to work as well in bright (read out in sun) conditions.  This is not an issue for me.  I found Agile Testing to be very readable even with its charts and diagrams.  The discount and portability make all Kindles a win over regular books.One of the areas the Kindle does well is music.  In addition to free storage for content purchased on Amazon, I had 5 GB of storage available to upload music from my library.  If this becomes cramped, there is an option to upgrade to 20 GB for a reasonable price.  Everything I had previously purchased from the Amazon mp3 Store was automatically in the \"Cloud\" section of my library.  The music player has standard features of Playlists, along with Artists, Albums, and Songs organization of your music.  You have the option of downloading music to the device.  I would do this for plane trips or other times when I don't have Wi-Fi access.  Like all of the Amazon content sections you have access to the \"Store\" in addition to your \"Library\".  It is easy (almost too easy) to impulse buy music.  In addition to content and a good UI, you will also have access to good sound on playback.  This comes from both the strong speakers which are clear and loud and headphones.  I used my Ultimate Ears Metro-Fi 220 headphones, and I found the music playback to be outstanding - especially considering that it is streaming.Video is another area where the Kindle Fire does well.  It is the Amazon Instant Video equivalent of the Music feature.  Playback is really good.  Breaking Bad looked great, and the audio track was in sync with the picture.  It does seem to have an initial buffering issue, and it pauses once about 10 seconds in.  However that is the only glitch I've experienced.  My video use is not as heavy as my music use, but it meets all of my expectations.Docs are really not a feature that is important to me, and I have little to say about it.The Apps section gives you access to the Amazon Android App Store.  I also have a Droid X and have been using the App Store since day one.  All of my apps that Amazon has verified for the Kindle Fire all appear in the \"Cloud\" section of my \"Library\".  I installed Netflix, ESPN Score Center, Angry Birds Rio, and Seesmic without issue.  All behave properly as I have experienced them on my Droid.  For some reason I was unable to get UberSocial to install.  I have not tried again since the first day since I am happy with Seesmic as an alternative.  Through the Kindle Fire I was also introduced to the Pulse app.  It is a tile based RSS style reader.  I moved my more news oriented Twitter Friends over here and cleaned up my timeline.  Some may say that the app selection is too limited, but I think that it has plenty to offer for its target audience.Last but not least we have the Web menu.  This launches your last session of Silk.  It is a tabbed browser, but it does not have plug-ins like Firefox, Chrome, or even Dolphin (familiar to experienced Android users).  It gives a good browsing experience, but I have not noticed a big speed boost from its split cloud architecture.  If you are concerned about privacy issues with the cloud, it is very easy to go into the settings menu and turn this feature off.  Then you are back to a direct browser to site experience as you would have on any other device.  Full sites are fairly readable without zooming in landscape mode.  You has have tap to zoom functionality as well should you need a larger view.  The experience is adequate, but I don't think it lives up to the hype - yet.  In theory, Amazon will begin getting pages cashed in the cloud as more users surf on their Kindle Fire.  The jury is still out.I'll finish with some miscellaneous items.  I experienced no issues with multitasking.  The Kindle Fire can easily handle streaming music while surfing the web or reading my Twitter timeline.  There are two performance annoyances that I have experienced.  Sometimes a swipe (turning a page in a book, etc.) is sluggish.  While it doesn't ruin my enjoyment, I'd rather it didn't happen.  Second there are occasions when the Kindle Fire does not recognize a touch selection.  I can't explain it.  There is no rhyme or reason for it, but it is infrequent.  Again this is not enough to ruin the experience, but I would rather do without it altogether.  As a final not (and as of this writing) there are few choices that I like among the cases designed for the Kindle Fire.  I am actually using the Targus Truss Case/Stand for BlackBerry PlayBook instead, and it works great (see my review).I know this was long, but I wanted to be complete.  If there is anything that I have not covered, please ask below in the comments.  I highly recommend the Kindle Fire.

I wanted an iPad but Apple doesn't seem to care about it's customers unless it's in their best interest so when Amazon announced the Kindle Fire I wondered if they would price it in the range of everyone else and I'm happy to say that they didn't and in fact, they admitted that if anything, they are taking a loss on the fire which got people complaining that it's not worth it because there's no \"fancy\" features like a camera, 3G and all that stuff. But here's the thing: People like to bitch and complain without thinking logically so allow me to that with my review..CAMERA-----Why is this an issue? I mean does a tablet really need one? This is why you have a phone and a regular one. No one's gonna carry a tablet everywhere they go (At least I won't). Seriously, a camera isn't really a deal breaker for me and it shouldn't be for you either.3G-- Not including this on the Fire actually makes good sense when you think about it because it'll end up costing you extra. Think about it: When it comes to 3G on tablets, you are stuck with AT&T; for the service and you have to pay a monthly fee regardless of if you have them as your phone carrier. So you pay $199 for the fire or $599 for the iPad and now you've also got an extra $50 a month for the 3G (or whatever plan you choose). Besides, what's the big deal with WiFi? You just update everything before you go out. And why do you need 3G to read a book, play a game, listen to music or watch something you've already downloaded?BLUETOOTH--------I don't really understand why this would even be an issue on a tablet. Why would you need this on one? I don't even think the iPad has it.SD CARD-------Sure people are not going to want to buy a Fire because of the lack of one but Amazon purposely left it out because of there cloud storage which, like Apple, holds everything you've ever bought and stores it on it's servers. This also allows you to read a book on the Kindle Fire and then continue reading it somewhere else on another device and it automatically saves the last position you left off in and while having an SD expansion slot would have been nice, I understand why it was left out. In my opinion, I like the cloud service because if I ever have to replace the device or something, I don't have to go around trying to remember what I downloaded because it's already there waiting for me and if you have that issue with memory, wouldn't you just delete what you don't need anymore to make more room? So I feel this is really a moot point.SYNCING--------Continuing from the above, the Kindle Fire does connect to your computer so you can transfer back and forth between the two if you need to make room but don't want to delete anything. While the Fire doesn't come with a USB cable, you can use the same one you use for your phone. In fact, any micro USB plug will do and your computer/s will recognize it.BATTERY LIFE------------This might be an issue for many but the trick is to \"dim\" the display. The higher the display will eat up the battery quicker but this isn't always true as it depends what you are doing. Generally speaking, reading an E Book will hardly use up all the power but playing a game will and possibly videos to. It's a tricky thing when it comes to the battery because it's really how you balance it out. Personally, I have yet to have an issue with it. What I can say is that I can go 2, 3 days w/o a charge and that was with using it for a few hours on the first day I got it. What I have yet to figure out yet is if plugging it into the computer will charge it like it does with everything else...WEB BROWSING-----------Since I hate using stock browsers, I side-loaded Dolphin instead so I really don't know if Amazon's Silk technology works with other browsers but from what I can tell it seems to work fine but I'm also under the impression that it depends on how fast of a speed your WIFI connection is.MAGAZINES--------There are very few offered right now but I'm sure this will change over time. By the way, there's a special though with select magazines for a free 90 day subscription with Conde Nest but the offering are lousy unless you like those magazines. I haven't used it fully yet though but from what I did see, it works great and it takes up the whole screen.E BOOKS-------The heart of the Fire and it actually works. It works just like the regular Kindles where you can customize the settings based on your reading preference. What I like about it is that you can highlight on a word and get the meaning. Yup. It's got a built in dictionary which isn't really surprising because one of the pre installed apps is The Oxford Dictionary.VIDEOS------I really love the fact that you have hundreds and hundreds of Movies and TV to choose from for FREE (well only if you are a Prime member) but at $79 a year it really is worth it and Amazon gives you a one month trial but the Prime basically works for everything on the site. Aside from that, I had no issues with viewing or sound. Some people have said they get some looping and jumping but that might be a hardware or software issue on some devices. Again, this uses the cloud feature and you can watch outside of the Kindle Fire as well and it saves the spot you left off at. .SOUND-----Unlike most mobile phones, The Fire's got two stereo speakers and it works great. I watched 2 movies and one TV episode in my home and I didn't need any headsets and you might say because of where I was but I tried the same thing with my phone and I did need a headset.USER INTERFACE-------------I should point out that Kindle Fire runs Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) but you wouldn't even know it by looking at the thing the way Amazon's skinned it. They might have gone a bit overboard with it and I still don't know why they chose to heavily do so but I do think that some improvements can be made because it's to dark and dreary. It's not all perfect though because there's no reason why Amazon only allows you to have 4 favorites. If you choose more, it replaces the other one. Favorites should be kept in one spot all together and not by Amazon's choosing. Also, the touch response doesn't always work which can be frustrating (here's hoping this gets fixed in an update). I also hate the stock keyboard it comes with. I wish I good find a better one.APP STORE--------This is a weakness that I am NOT happy about. Why is this connected to your phone's device? What I mean by that is: If I download something to my Fire and then open up the app store on my phone, the app is there as well. Why? Shouldn't Amazon have a separate app store for tablets? Because I want swift key for my Fire but it's nowhere to be found yet on my phone, it shows that there's a swift key for Tablets.. So out of curiosity, I downloaded it to my phone and it said: NOT COMPATIBLE FOR PHONES. Huh? Does this make any sense? So Amazon, fix your store and make up your mind.Time to end my review so:IN CLOSING---------I'm happy with my Kindle Fire and like I said earlier, Amazon made sacrifices to get it at the $199 price point knowing they would get a loss on it but from a business point, it makes sense because they will make it up in other areas and really, when you think about it, the Kindle Fire is a huge success  so is it really a loss in the long run? What's really good about this though is that Amazon could look at this Fire as an experimental product and learn what works and what doesn't for the next version.I didn't mention HDMI because you can buy an HDMI adapter and use it as one so it's not a big deal. Personally, I can do without it. I should mention the NOOK because it's almost exactly the same as the Fire and if you compare the two you might notice little to no difference. The Nook, by the way has been skinned as well running the same software. While you can't compare this to the iPAD,(and it really would be hard to) I firmly believe that Amazon has a winner here because of what they offer and because of their quality. Not only that your less likely to get \"crap\" apps because Amazon strictly monitors and approves what goes into it's app store. Yes, I'm aware Apple is to but they are worse. I really like this tablet and it's a great start for Amazon and if they support it often with updates (and it needs a few) this can be the iPAD killer people are hoping it to be. But it is the hottest holiday gift right now and for good reason.The Kindle Fire needs some improvements and here's hoping Amazon reads the concerns and takes care of them.By the way, I hope Amazon updates it's software do allow video files such as DIVX, AVI,MPEG 4 and others.", "Date": "November 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "I'm fired up!", "Author": "azog", "ReviewID": "R1KJQ76Y5W5S7A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've deliberately avoided reading reviews on the Fire, because the one review (a \"trusted name\", someone who should know better) I read constantly compared the Fire to the iPad. I know it's not an iPad. I don't have, nor did I ever want, an iPad, and such comparisons are ultimately meaningless. I did not want to find myself being swayed by other people's opinions in matters which have no bearing.This is my first tablet. I've used Android since the original Motorola Droid (currently using a Droid 3), so I'm fairly comfortable with the environment. The Fire is obviously heavily customized to Amazon, but many of the basic navigation tasks and features still apply.I was pondering a Samsung tablet, but once concrete rumors of the Amazon tablet started to surface, I decided to wait. I find no regrets in my decision, as the Fire does what I want a tablet to do. I won't go into gory detail, as I'm sure plenty others have done so.The device is a bit heavy, substantially so. At least it doesn't feel like a toy. Set up was a breeze. Simply turn it on, connect it to my WiFi, and off we go. It took me no more than 60 seconds from turn on until I started to see all my Kindle books showing up. I have the Kindle reader app on my Droid 3, and it's the same app. Since I have a Kindle reader, I will continue to use that for its intended purpose. I'm a heavy reader, so the benefits of the eInk display and battery life of the Kindle reader far outweigh the Fire in that regards.I was initially concerned over the storage, 8gb with no expansion. But then I realized it's not really important. There's not much to store, everything is \"in the cloud, man\" (I like the concept, but I do hate the phrase).The first thing I did was use my Prime membership to view some videos (the first Star Trek episode, as well as a Chinese military movie, \"The Warriors\"), and I am pleasantly surprised with the video quality and sound. This was my primary reason for buying the Fire. Amazon has been adding videos for Prime members, and I only hope they continue their progress to acquire more.The screen is very glossy and reflective. It feels like Gorilla glass (not 100% certain on that), but I think I might get a screen protector just to cut back on the glare. Watching a video and seeing my ugly mug in the reflection was a bit of distraction.At the moment, I think I've watched about 4 hours of video. I can't comment on the battery life, but it seemed to be more than 75% remaining at that point. Even so, given my intended usage, if I need to plug it in while watching a video, that is not much of an issue.Connected to my e-mail accounts (disappointed that the official Gmail app doesn't seem to be available), installed a few simple apps. Did some web browsing. All to be as expected, no complaints. Response to screen taps, swipes, etc, was all acceptable with no real lag or sluggishness. I never really found myself \"waiting\" for an app to acknowledge.In the middle of the home screen is something called the \"carousel\", which is basically a Rolodex of all your previously used apps, opened books, videos, etc. Unfortunately, it got cluttered pretty fast as I explored my tablet, and there does not seem to be a way to clean it out, or remove something that I'm not interested in seeing on my carousel. There does not seem to be any way to filter, either. I hope Amazon addresses this in a not-so-distant future firmware update.Well, I could go on and on and on, but I won't, and will simply close review by restating my overall satisfaction with the Fire.", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Compared to Kindle 3G", "Author": "Noname", "ReviewID": "R3K3NM6NLSEGZY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I own a Kindle 3G and a netbook.  My husband bought the Kindle Fire for me as an early Christmas gift.  He thought it would just be a novelty, since I do like reading on my Kindle.  I've spent more than a week playing with the Fire and here's how it stacks up.E-READERThe Fire is heavier than the Kindle 3G and I do feel it.  When reading for long periods of time, I need to prop the Fire, whereas the Kindle 3G can be held in just one hand.I thought swiping the screen to turn each page would be a minor inconvenience, but I found that the pages turn when I just hit the side of the screen, much like hitting the button on the Kindle 3G.  I just need to remember to keep the thumb off the screen until I need to turn.I was worried that staring at the bright screen would hurt my eyes, but I read a novel through a few days of heavy reading, and my eyes didn't hurt at all.  The only problem is the glare when I'm sitting in sunny areas of the house.  There's never any glare on the Kindle 3G.  On the other hand, I often read at night, and it's hard to do on the Kindle 3G, even with a book light.  I now prefer the Fire for reading at night.  The screen brightness can be adjusted for intensity.Children's books look beautiful on the Fire.  I have The Complete Adventures of Curious George, Anniversary Edition and it reads so much better on the Fire than the Kindle 3G.  The illustrations are in full color and are beautiful.I love the bookmark function.  It's much easier to use on the Fire than the Kindle 3G.  Plus, when I want to flip through the pages, I can just swipe.  That's nicer than searching or punching in a location number or pressing the back button.  Searching for a definition or a finding a word in another location in the book is also easier on the Fire.  I just touch the word and I'm there.  No need for the toggle.I noticed the Fire doesn't read the books out loud.  For those who like the Kindle to read their books for them, the Kindle 3G will read.  However, I never use that function.Sorting: What happened to sorting?  Kindle 3G has a sorting function.  Fire does not.  This can present a problem for some people.  I like to sort my books.  I hope Amazon will fix this.*For everyone who has problems accidentally hitting the off button while reading, do what I do and turn the Fire upside down.*  The accelerometer will flip the screen automatically and you will no longer have this problem.  I hope Amazon will put the button on top for the next model.TYPINGI don't like typing with either the Fire or Kindle 3G.  At first, I was cursing the Fire, because of the mistypes, but I got used to it and it's easier now.  Typing with either one is a chore.  If I need to do a lot of typing, I prefer to use my desktop or my netbook.MUSICI don't use my Fire much for music, but I have tried it and it's nice to have the music on while reading or other functions.  I can even turn the screen off and it still plays.MOVIESMovies stream well.  The movie ap lists all the free Prime movies right on top so I don't even have to search for them.  The resolution isn't great, but who needs great resolution on such a tiny screen?  This is good for the kids and when I'm bored.EMAILWonderful app that's easy to set up and go.  It's so nice to not have to go on the web to read my email.AMAZON AND THE WEBI like the shopping app.  Amazon has my likes and dislikes pinned down.  Web surfing is fun, the screen looks great; but not all functions work on the Fire (I can't get the Black Friday deals to scroll either direction) the screen's touch sensitivity is sporadic.  Sometimes, barely a swipe will send me to a page I don't want to be on and sometimes, I tap, tap, tap, push until it finally clicks and goes.Pages load relatively quickly.  I think it's about as fast as my netbook.  I don't think wow when it's loading, but I'm not moaning and groaning from boredom, either.WI-FI VS. 3GThis difference is obvious.  I would really like to have this Fire have 3G functionality.  I was stuck without Wi-Fi over the past week and couldn't download any new books.  So sad.  I do hope the next version of Fire will include 3G.BATTERY LIFEBattery life is not as long as the Kindle 3G (which can last me a week with the 3G turned off), but I can read the Fire all day before it needs charging.  I mean literally all day, so it's not really a problem.  I consider the battery life to be very good.PROS:+ easier to read in the dark than the Kindle 3G+ great for illustrated children's books+ easier to flip through pages for quick scanning+ easier to search for definitions and word locations+ listen to music as you perform other tasks+ easy to find free Prime movies - streams well+ email function easy to set up and use+ uses Wi-Fi+ good battery lifeCONS:- heavier than the Kindle 3G- screen glare- does not read the books out loud- no book sorting function- typing is a chore- screen's touch sensitivity -- sometimes too sensitive, sometimes not sensitive enough- not all web functions work on the Fire- no 3GCONCLUSIONOverall, I've very happy with the Kindle Fire.  It will replace my netbook for short excursions from the home and my Kindle 3G for reading at night.  For my heavy daytime reading, I will still read the Kindle 3G.  For my heavy typing, I will use my netbook or desktop.______________________UPDATE September 15, 2012: I've had plenty of time to play with my Kindle Fire.  It's been wonderful.  The screen's touch sensitivity has improved since I first got it.  I find myself using it more than the Kindle 3G, especially since putting a matte screen protector on it.

I fell in love. In 2010 I purchased the Kindle 3. My love affair continued. In 2011 I purchased the Kindle Fire. I fell out of love. I consume vast amounts of books and am always mobile. So ability to hold this device in one hand is essential when I am standing on the train. Unfortunately, after getting used to the Kindle 3's weight, the weight of the Kindle Fire came as a shock. The Amazon description of the weight is accurate, but the expectation that an additional 7oz or so would not be much was met with a hard reality. Holding this in one hand - as the picture shows - is problematic. The wrist begins to hurt after a few minutes. But that is not Amazon's fault. It is a beautiful device, if sort of sluggish in response. I give it two stars because two stars means that I don't like it. And I don't like it because I have been spoiled by Amazon. Back to the Kindle 3 I go. For anyone who is maybe not so mobile as I am, I recommend this.

I'm sending mine back.  My wife loves to read eBooks, she loves it.  I for one would rather have my EVO and laptop.A few complaints against Amazon, and not the Kindle Fire.First- A PRIME Membership is required for EACH family member that wishes to have a Kindle Fire.  Yes, you can invite and allow up to four family members to use your PRIME, but it is for shipping ONLY!  If they want to stream videos, then they are required to purchase another membership for $79 per year.  Pretty crappy on Amazons part if you ask me.Second- If you are buying this for someone as a gift, or thought you might resale it, please note that it ships already activated with your account.  I never had to put my password in for my Amazon stuff.  Scary if you ask me.  It's quick and handy that they already have some of your info, but at least ask for a password.All in all, this is only a 3 star device.

Since I already had a Kindle and Nook Color, I debated whether I should spend the money on the Kindle Fire. I think each device has a distinct advantage in one aspect, but the Kindle Fire is already the overall winner after running it through the paces just today.Kindle FireDistinct Advantage -- a media device that works seamlessly with Amazon's book, video, MP3 and app offerings.Pros: The device looks clean and simple. Once I turned it on, I was able to use it right out of the box. Some reviewers had trouble with the carousel (icons of the last media viewed that you can scroll through). It moves faster/slower smoothly and I had no trouble stopping it on a specific item.The screen has this wonderful smooth, slippery surface that's missing from the Nook Color. It's bright, clear and feels great as I navigate with my fingers.I find my wrist gets tired within 5-10 minutes when I hold the Nook Color up using one hand. I didn't have that issue with the Kindle Fire. It feels more balanced in my hand.The apps I'd used on my smartphone, like Angry Birds and All Recipes, are better than ever on the 7-inch screen.Shopping for new ebooks in the Kindle Store is a new experience. I noticed Amazon highlights books that will view beautifully on the Fire over the B&W; Kindle screen such as comics and children's books. The categories also highlight the new Kindle Lending bookstore. If you scroll down the main Kindle shopping page, the top 100 Free ebooks are near the bottom. The Kindle Fire Kindle store is mainly about bestsellers, suggested books, tablet-friendly books and category book browsing.A BIG PLUS was watching video online on sites like You Tube or any site that has flash videos. It's hand down better than the Nook Color web experience, esp. with video (see more below).Cons: I didn't find much not to like. I wish this device had a microphone or at least offer a bluetooth option. I use an app on my cell that requires a mike for voice recording, a no-go on this tablet.There is no text-to-speech feature for books that is a killer app on previous Kindles. I am disappointed it's missing and I hope Amazon considers adding it back.A big surprise to me was that all the kindle 3 Games that I've purchased by Amazon Digital Services (and Others) such as Every Word do not even appear on my Kindle Fire bookshelf -- and they won't work because of the lack of navigation buttons that are on the Kindle 3. I don't want the navigation buttons--not at all--but I probably won't be buying more games on my old Kindle 3 since it's stuck on that device. Anyway, the game apps for Kindle Fire blow the socks off the Kindle 3's limited game play.Kindle 3I'm still using my Kindle 3 (3G) almost every single day.Distinct Advantage: I work on the computer all day so I find the eInk is very easy on my eyes after looking at a backlit screen.In the car or at the lake in the summer, the Kindle 3 can't be beat.I'm concerned that the Kindle Fire won't have enough content to cover a day traveling where I don't have wifi. That's never been a problem with my Kindle 3. I have over 150 books on there, and I can get more via 3G almost anywhere.As a reading device, it's the most booklike and the easiest on the eyes.Cons: Kindle 3 is not a multi-media device. As I mentioned the games made for Kindle 3 have noticeable limitations.You can surf the internet on the Kindle 3, but it's not a good experience at all. Comparing Kindle 3 web to the Kindle Fire is not even apples and oranges.Nook ColorI was pretty excited when I got the Nook Color with the hopes for something more like a tablet-slash-ereader.Distinct advantage: Being able to buy B&N;'s books and also to view ePub ebooks you load to the Nook.However, B&N;'s interface is heavy-handed and all the advantages of a potential reader tablet isn't there. I finally hacked my Nook to get the apps and Android functionality I wanted, but it was still clunky and when B&N; updated the Nook software I was back to square one. Argh.B&N; added apps last summer, but the selection is ridiculously limited and apps that are free everywhere else, isn't free via the Nook. I can't get apps from the Google or Amazon's markets.I can use the Nook Color for surfing and viewing magazines is a decent experience (similar on the Fire). But the Kindle Fire web surfing is much smoother/faster than the Nook. I watched Project Runway on a Chinese site called Tudou on the Nook Color but only with lagging video and unclear video. On the Kindle Fire, the same videos on Tudou were perfect, clear and ran smooth -- as good as on my new PC. Wow.I don't know about the new Nook Tablet, but I can say the Kindle Fire beats the Nook Color for books, video, music, apps and web--no questions asked.The bottom line is I'm better than happy with the Kindle Fire. I expect to keep using the Kindle 3 for reading in certain situations and I'll no longer be fighting my kids for the Nook Color (they love it). I hope to God they don't find my new Kindle Fire anytime soon.::UPDATE:: My kids finally got to see the Kindle Fire -- the reaction? _Forget_ the Nook Color, I want one of those! SOOOO -- I put the Nook Color up for sale and it SOLD on eBay. I'm selling one more item to cover the cost of buying ANOTHER Kindle Fire for my teenage son as an early Christmas gift.BTW, I'll be getting him an Amazon gift card so I can set up his own Amazon account but without a credit card. He's old enough to take responsibility for these kinds of things and I will monitor his usage like I already do for other devices.My elementary age son tried the Kindle Fire and loves it (Mom, I want one!) but he has other devices for now (although I did consider it for a moment). I'd have to manage the Amazon account for him and I am concerned about him dropping or damaging the tablet.As for myself, I love using it more and more. I got a stand to hold my KF while I'm cooking for reading recipes or watching a video while I cook.

A few things lead to that decision. First, the absence of the Google Market and incompatibility with standard Google apps like Youtube or Google Reader was frustrating.

While somewhat nitpicky, the lack of customization (such as lock screen background images) bothered me.There were positives. The design of the tablet is solid and clean. I appreciated the ability to install Go Launcher EX if I didn't always want to use Amazon's launcher. Amazon's launcher (the shelf) was easy to navigate and well integrated with Amazon's services.

However, a lot of my \"research\" involved reading the customer reviews. There were several issues brought up that weren't quite accurate, as I noticed when I received my Kindle.Customization with carousel: A few people said they had trouble not being able to edit what shows up on the carousel on the Fire homepage. However, you can. The carousel features the most recent content, be it books, apps, videos, etc. Simply press and hold an icon, and just like with any app on Apple products, a little menu comes up with three options - Add to Favorites, Remove from Carousel, and Remove from Device. Though you may not be able to control the order of the carousel items, you can control what is currently displayed.Limited memory: The Kindle Fire does have a smaller amount of internal storage than other tablets, but it really doesn't need all that much. If someone wanted this product as a cheaper way to play games, listen to music, or watch movies, they are probably better off investing in an iPad. The Kindle is, indeed, a Kindle - so the main purpose is to hold books. Between books, a few apps to kill time, and a video/movie here and there, along with the Cloud storage, the memory is fine.Wi-Fi, not 3G: There is no 3G internet service for out-of-the-house accessibility. But many people these days have smartphones, like myself, so I personally don't see it as an issue.No camera: It's a Kindle, not a media device. If you're looking for a camera, again I suggest something like an iPad or a Samsung Galaxy Tab.No text-to-speech: It is true, the Fire does not have to handy text-to-speech option when reading a book. I have not found it a problem yet because I rarely used it. Although, they do feature many other options not available to my slightly-outdated Kindle Keyboard, such as editing margin size, color mode, and several additional typeface choices.No volume buttons: Unlike the iPad, there are no actual buttons to adjust volume. But the given volume meter is very simple to use and easily accessible.Power button location: I also have seen a few comments about the power button being on the bottom, and how easy it was to accidentally be turned off. I guess this is a concern, if someone has no case/cover and holds the Kindle vertical on a surface when using. So it depends.Overall, I love my Kindle Fire. I haven't played with it long enough to find any major flaws, but it seems to fit exactly what I was looking for. The Fire is no iPad, for sure. I think a lot of people who found the Fire insufficient were looking for an inexpensive replacement for an iPad, or other similar tablet. This product is for people who want a fast, useful e-reader with the added bonus of playing games, watching videos, and easily surfing the web. The only, and I mean only, reason I gave the Fire 4/5 stars is because it is definitely not what everyone is looking for in a tablet. You have to want what it offers in order to enjoy it as much as I do. I absolutely recommend this to anyone who thinks it will suit them well.Thank you for taking the time to read my review.-Sam W., age 13", "Date": "June 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "LOVE my Kindle Fire!", "Author": "ceb111481 \"ceb111481\"", "ReviewID": "R1RFM70NE2NIG3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I took my Kindle Fire out of the box and I had a hard time putting it down.

As a long time fan of the Kindle, I was on the lookout for the next generation of the e-reader that's changed my life so much. When I started to read the marketing hype about Amazon Silk browser, I was intrigued. I liked the idea of a portable web appliance for my home and office. A 7 inch screen was just the right size for that round-the-house browsing my family would enjoy. For example, I liked the idea of ordering takeout through a restaurant's website on a portable device, then handing the device to my wife and kids so they could order what they want. I had considered buying an iPad in the past for that purpose, but at $500+ that seemed pricey, especially for a device that wouldn't support Flash. For $199, I was now going to be granted two wishes at once: I'd be getting the next generation e-reader, as well as full-featured a portable web browser.My enthusiasm was quickly diminished. The device is VERY frustrating to use. Touches don't register very easily. Unlike my other touch devices (which, for the record, are not only iPhones and iPads, but other Android and even Microsoft devices as well), the movement of images and forms on the screen is slow and sticky. Simple tasks such as selecting a book or recently-used app from my home screen are tedious, requiring multiple touches to register the selection. The browser is a horrible HORRIBLE disappointment. The pages are slow to load, and difficult to move around. I am unable to scroll a webpage while it is still loading, and it's difficult to tell when a page is fully loaded. That gives the impression of a frozen web page a lot of the time. Normally I wouldn't complain about that. If a page is still loading, then I should wait for the content to complete, right? However I found that most of the time the page content loaded just fine, but then I was stuck waiting for the Flash ads to load. What's worse, the page isn't disabled while it's loading. Instead, it registered your actions, and then executes them all at the end of the load, leaving you lost in a link, out of focus, and annoyed with the experience.The Flash support is a joke. Almost every Flash-enabled site I visited made my browser crash! Some pages, such as Speakeasy.net's broadband speed test tool (Speakeasy.net/speedtest), seemed to work at first, but then returned consistent script errors when halfway through the test. The Flash that DID work was limited to those horrible advertisements that slow down page loading. Now I have all of the hassle of those horrible animations and little or none of the benefit of the more powerful plugin-enhanced experiences. Some sites worked, but the experience was insufferable. Hulu.com rejected my web request due to the Android platform on which the Fire's OS is built. That was disappointment #1, but at least Hulu was honest about their lack of support. I went instead to Crackle.com, another online streaming content site powered by a LOT of Flash. It took me about 10 minutes and multiple tries before I got the movie \"Step Brothers\" to play in the web page. The crashes and errors I received seem to come from Crackle's Flash-based age validating tool. \"Step Brothers\", a rated R picture, could not be viewed on Crackle without entering my month, day, and year of birth on what appeared to be a Flash-scripted user interface. Bad news. My touches weren't always picked up. When they were, the screen had shifted and I inadvertently selected the wrong date or year. As the fields expanded and collapsed, the content shifted back and forth, causing me to constantly loose my place. The movie did eventually load, and seemed to play for a while with no further issues.In addition to the software, there are frustrating elements of the physical design. The lack of a home button is just ill conceived. I can't easily discern which way the device should be held to hold it right side-up. When I'm caught in one of those page loading freezes (no doubt waiting for some messy Flash turd of an advertisement to load up) I can't just hit that escape button to go back to the home page. Instead, you tap on the screen towards the bottom of the panel to get the Home page icon to show. Obviously if the device is not responding to your touches, you can't easily escape. Also, the on-off switch is very easy to accidentally hit. I sat with the Fire on my lap to read a magazine I downloaded and my belt kept pushing the power button., I didn't realize what was happening the first few times. I thought the device was crashing. Thankfully it was just my clumsy movements. Still, to be fair, I never had that problem on my other Kindles, or on other mobile devices for that matter. I do like the size and shape of the Fire. Unlike the iPad, it is a perfect design for a portable web surfing appliance. In fact, I went out to a doctor's visit and took the fire with me, and it easily slipped into my [admittedly spacious] inside jacket pocket. Ipads aren't meant for that kind of portability, but e-readers are.On a personal note, I think Amazon went a bit overboard with the Cloud integration. We all like the idea of storing our content safely, and flexibly on Amazon's massive server network. Yet when buying videos, books, and music I now have a two-step process to get my purchases on my device. This is no doubt designed to mitigate the seemingly paltry lack of local drive space. Nevertheless, when you are unable to connect to a 3G network you need to be 100% sure that you have all that you need ON THE DEVICE before you leave the WIFI hotspot. That  wasn't very clear to me when I downloaded my first video. Excited to view some purchased content from Amazon's vast array of TV and movie media, I downloaded an episode of \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\". I purchased it through my Fire and ran out to meet some friends in the bar for a beer. When I tried to play the video I just bought I was peeved to realize my purchased content was still floating in the cloud. I never took the extra step to download it to the device. Yes, it's easily fixable, and the cloud does have a lot of advantages. Still, I would hate to buy $25 worth of magazines for a plane trip and find out IN the clouds that I left my content ON the cloud. The irony of that pun would be eclipsed by my teeth grinding frustration.As far as connectivity goes, I'm ok with WIFI, even though it departs from Kindle's otherwise well-conceived purchase model. Remember, I am a die-hard fan of the original Kindle. One of the greatest, most brag-worthy features of the regular Kindle is the 3G-connected Kindle store. I can buy books, magazines, and other e-reader content from anywhere with a 3G signal without an account with a cellular provider. The purchase goes directly against my Amazon.com account. The Kindle Fire has no such cool 3G option. It would have been terrific if Amazon enabled 3G for purchases only, however one can easily understand the difference between downloading an e-book, versus downloading movies, songs, and surfing the web.Bottom line: I feel this first version of the Kindle Fire is a let down. At $199 I never expected it to do all of the wild thing an iPad does. What I did expect was that the tools it did deliver worked as well or better than those same tools on competing products. Do I judge the Fire for not have an accelerometer, compass, or even a camera? Not at all. However do I expect the well-hyped Amazon Silk browser to work as well than, say, Safari on iOs? You freakin' bet I do. Unlike so many reviews that are forgiving of Amazon's many misses because of the low price tag, I feel the need to chastise. The folks at Amazon need to focus on what they DID deliver, and make those tools work well. Instead, it almost feels as if Mr. Bezos and the gang bought into the it's-cheaper-so-it-doesn't-have-to-be-perfect attitude a little too much.", "Date": "November 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Too sluggish & can't uninstall Facebook & other third party apps", "Author": "KindlePad", "ReviewID": "R1WGJVK2SVPECD", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I am trying to like the Fire, but its unacceptable to have to press a button 3 times to get it to respond or swipe a page 3-4 times to get the page to turn.Also, I was trying to delete Facebook, IMDB and other apps and could not.

Amazon makes a lot of press about this being a Cloud device, but you can't directly access your amazon cloud drive from the Fire. That's right - that's not a mistake. I also asked that of the CS. They said if you want to access docs on your amazon cloud drive, you should email them to your Fire. Email them... to a cloud device. That's supposed to be a hugely wifi connected device.

Nolan \"freeholder\"", "ReviewID": "R2YTYGWTX8SFFY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Way too many reviews have tried to compare the Fire to the Ipad.  Silly.  The Fire was never intended nor marketed as a competitor to the Ipad.  Think about the differences between the two companies.  Apple mainly sells hardware, and has now entered the content market.  Amazon mainly sells content.  Remember that Amazon started out as a bookstore.  Other products came later.  The Fire is a Kindle.  It's right in the name.  \"Kindle Fire\"  It isn't designed, intended, or marketed as a tablet computer.  It is a simple device intended to access content, and mainly Amazon.com content.If you mainly want to read books, then one of the other Kindles would be a better choice.  Their e-ink screens are a bit easier on the eyes, and the battery life is way better.  You can read books on your Fire just fine, although bright sunlight may be an issue, as it is with any backlit device.  Hard for a few LEDs to compete with the sun!  However, the Fire really shines when you want to watch video.  Music is fine, too, but my smartphone will play music.  If you are near a WiFi hotspot, you can stream the video, and if you have Prime, there are thousands free.  If you own a video, you can download it to the Fire and watch it even if you aren't near a hotspot.Some have complained about the Fire having limited memory.  Remember, it isn't intended to be a computer.  It will store maybe 15 or 20 hours of video.  I don't know about your life, but I am VERY unlikely to ever watch 15 or 20 hours of video without being near a hotspot.  8 movies means at least 2 or 3 days before I'm through them, and hotspots aren't that rare.  Traveling?  Pretty much every hotel, motel, Starbucks, and fast food place has WiFi.  While you have coffee or lunch you can delete the watched films and download a new batch.  Amazon stores them all for you.  Same with books.  We've had Kindles since the very first one came out, and we own a LOT of books.  No need to keep them all on our device.  We download them as needed.  If we want to read one again, it takes a minute or so to retrieve it.The screen on the Kindle is VERY sharp and clear, with an excellent viewing angle.  Easy for two or three to watch.  Clear text is easy to read, the browser works well, and Internet pages look good.  Most all Android apps I have tried work fine.  Some have complained about the location of the power button, but it hasn't been any problem for me.  It probably depends upon how you hold it.  I find the interface easy to use, but I do use a Droid phone, so I was familiar with the Android OS.  In the interest of full disclosure I should also mention that I have taught computer science at the college level for 30+ years, so I am kind of a geek.I don't want to give the wrong impression.  I read books on the Fire frequently.  I'm just saying that if you want to read for hours at a time, especially outside, a regular Kindle would be a little better.  I have both.All in all, the Fire is an excellent product that does what it is supposed to do very well.", "Date": "December 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "What do you want to use the Kindle Fire for is the question?", "Author": "girlpelican", "ReviewID": "R3AFRB4YKXQE5V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the Kindle Fire because I think all the cell phones are overrated for the price you have to pay for them.  I got tired of my cell phone dying, I just needed a phone to talk and another device to do all the other stuff.  So now when we are out and about running errands my son is playing games on the Kindle Fire and my cell phone battery is not being drained.  My husband and I had the greatest night out to dinner for the first time.  Our son played the dinosaur flash cards on the Kindle the entire time.  The children's books cost too much money, I was shocked.  For Brown Bear it is 12.99.  The graphics are neat but that is way too much money for childrens books.  They run from 1.99 to about 24.99.  The free streaming movies on Amazon Prime is awesome.  My son has already watched Jetsons the Movie and Barney's First Christmas; without even charging the battery.  All the apps you can download are awesome, they are the same apps you can get on android but bigger screen.  The touch screen is very good, probably not the best but I was surprised how accruate.  I have been on Facebook and e-mail....works great!  I have purchsed from the Oriental Trading Company and Overstock with no issues.  I am unsure why people have been saying web surfing is slow, I have not found that to be true.  I love the borrow book, 1 a month on Amazon Prime.  I am half way through my first book already.  I do like the E-ink reader better on the old kindle but glad to sacrafice that to have the bright screen for other things.  You can change the background to a vanilla color on the books and that has helped me.  I wish it had the 3G like the Kindle DX, the Kindle Fire says it comes with the Whispernet but I haven't figured that out yet.  There is only 6.5 GB on the device storage but the cloud is unlimited, I can't see me even coming close to that anyway.  I don't really have much from my computer I will put out on it anyway.  Yes, it does not take pictures or video.  There are so many other things that do that so I don't really care.  To me, I am breaking out my Canon anyway because if I am going to take pictures or video I want quality.  I don't need those instant post to Facebook, just use your cell phone for that.  To me the Kindle Fire has a lot to offer and I like amazons products so I don't mind being locked into them and the thought of them coming out with a cell phone in 2012 is really exciting because then I would have access to all the stuff on the cloud.  The power cord that comes with it is about 2 feet long and not good quality.  I have not upgraded because my cell phone USB power cord works just fine.  All this just depends on what you are going to use it for and what you really want.  The Ipad for me was too expensive and I knew that I wouldn't use half of what it could do.  So the bottom line for me is the Kindle Fire is AWESOME!  The only really down side for me is getting it away from my son.  He has asked for it for Christmas instead of the Nintendo DSI XL.  I haven't checked out to see if we can share the cloud and so forth so that is next on my list!

So far I've used it to read a couple chapters of a book, look through the Kindle Fire user guide briefly, played some Angry Birds, poked around in Quick Office, browsed Amazon and my ESPN fantasy football website and setup a couple of different email accounts.So far everything has worked basically the same as it would on my iPad. The organization is different, but straight-forward and easy to figure out. The one thing so far that is a bit frustrating is there is no way to just randomly play music from your collection. You have to specifically setup playlists, which again isn't difficult, but is a little bit annoying as I'm they type of person that just wants to hit play and hear music. On the other hand, I didn't buy this device to listen to music on a regular basis, so it's not that big of a deal.I find the eBook functionality a bit friendlier and easier on the eyes than iBooks on the iPad. The \"pages\" are obviously smaller than the larger screen on the iPad, but the device is also smaller and lighter to hold. I also like that on the Kindle Fire I have the option of choosing a different background color when reading my eBooks either white, cream or black background. I found the cream background with black text to be a good combination.As far as App availability, I've found most all of the apps and games that I use on my iPad are also available for the Kindle Fire from the Amazon App Store with the exception of Civilization Revolution. The selection isn't nearly as large as the Apple App Store or the Android Marketplace, but there are a ton of apps listed in both of those places that aren't worth the trouble of downloading.Bottom line, so far I'm am happy with the Kindle Fire, at this point I think I'll use it mainly for eBook reading, casual game play and the iPad will get used for certain games, taking notes during meetings, and apps where the larger screen comes into play.I'll update this review after I've used the device more and have more feedback to offer.NOTE: just read some of the other reviews which mention trouble connecting to WiFi, I've connected to it to two different secured WiFi networks (one 802.11n and one 802.11g) so far and had no problems with either one. The Kindle Fire connected to both networks in a matter of seconds and also reconnected automatically to my home WiFi network when I got back home.

I own a desktop, but it's in a different room than where my television is at, and I wanted something portable. I thought about the Ipad but I didn't want to spend that kind of money on something I would only use to surf the web for the most part. So what was I going to do???I heard about a new tablet computer called the 'Kindle Fire'. Sure, I thought the name sounded cool, but I was very skeptical about this thing. My main concern was that I heard and read it was very slow while browsing the internet.I decided to take a chance on it anyway; for $200, it's not really a big risk in my opinion. Once I got it home and had a chance to play around with it, i was blown away at how fast the internet browsing was! It was even faster than my wife's laptop, which has Windows 7 and about 3 GB of RAM. I have no idea as to what some of these people are talking about when they say the internet browsing is poor, and to say I almost listened to them.THINGS I RECOMMEND YOU BUY ALONG WITH ITIt would be a great idea to buy some type of case for your Kindle Fire. The case that I chose, also acts as a stand, which makes it easier to watch movies on it. I'm the type of person that doesn't like to use my fingers on touch-screens. So if you're like me, I suggest getting a Stylus to perform all of your navigations. I recommend the \"BoxWave Slimline Capacitive Kindle Fire Stylus\" because it has a smaller tip that works better for the smaller Kindle Fire, as compared to the larger Ipad. Speaking of navigating the Kindle Fire, regardless if you use your finger or a stylus, you'll eventually get a few smear marks here and there, so it would be a good idea to by a microfiber cloth to clean the glass every now and then. None of the above are required for the Kindle Fire, I just found all three things to be rather useful :)THINGS I DON'T CARE ABOUTWell, I guess there are some drawbacks to the Kindle Fire that some people may view as a deal breaker, but I couldn't care less. I'll just do my due diligence and list them. It doesn't have a lot of storage space, only about 8 GB I believe. This is fine with me because I don't store anything but a few books on there anyway, and books don't take up that much space. Doesn't have a built in camera. Again, I don't have a need for this, if I wanted a camera, I would buy a camera. The last thing I can think of is that it doesn't have 3G. I don't care about that because I only use it at home with my own WIFI anyway. If I do decide to go out, I could read my books that I have saved to the device, don't need internet for that.Since I am a reasonable and unbiased person most of the time, I'll give you guys one thing I don't like about the Kindle Fire. I wish the volume control was part of the hardware, as opposed to the software. In other words,I wish there was a switch on the Kindle itself that allowed me to change the volume. It gets annoying having to use the touch-screen to change the volume. But not annoying enough to deduct a star ;)If you're looking for something that's portable and allows you to surf the internet with ease, think about giving the Kindle Fire a shot.

To give a bit of context, I love my Kindle 3G but I've never been a big fan of tablets. I've never wanted an iPad. But with my switch to mostly Kindle books for my reading and Amazon MP3 for my music, and since I was looking for a cheap replacement for my Windows desktop (which was mainly a web, email and music storage box), the Kindle Fire looked like it would meet that need perfectly.I can say without a doubt that it definitely meets that need. It was great turning my Kindle Fire on for the first time and seeing all my books there on the home screen. They weren't downloaded yet, but to see all my purchased, cloud stored content right out of the box was fantastic. It definitely felt like, \"This is MY Kindle Fire\", right out of the box. There was very little setup. It even said \"JJ's Kindle Fire\" at the top. I love that.The limited storage space (only 6.54GB of the 8GB is available), isn't a big deal thanks to Amazon's cloud storage. You can easily switch between what's stored on the device and what's on the cloud for each media type (There are Device and Cloud buttons at the top of almost every screen). And adding and removing content from the device is a snap. And when I brought it to work I was pleased to see that I could still see all my cloud content. While I obviously can't download it, I did add it to my download queue. [I'll update the review if it automatically downloads when I get connected to Wi-fi.] UPDATE: To my pleasant surprise, when I got home after writing this review my downloads started automatically. So you can queue up downloads when you're Fire isn't connected and they will start automatically when it is. Gotta love that!As much as I love the device I do have a few minor gripes which keep it from getting 5 stars (I would have given it 4 1/2 if the ratings let me). First off, the power button is poorly placed. The first few hours after I got it I accidentally turned it off more times than I can count. Even showing people how poorly placed the button was...\"Opps, yeah I just turned it off by accident. See what I mean?\" The Kindle 3G's power button is fine on the bottom because it's a slider. To put the Kindle in sleep mode you have to slide the button. It's possible of course (I've done it), but it's hard to do by accident too frequently. The Kindle Fire's power button on the other hand is an actual button. Hit it slightly and it goes to sleep. Holding it for a few seconds gives the prompt to power down. But just a light press and it goes into sleep mode. It's even more troublesome if you have a password set on it since you'll have to login again. It's happened less and less as days go on, but those initials hours were almost maddening. I suspect a case will probably help (it's back-ordered), but overall it was a major annoyance right out of the box.Another minor gripe is that it seems unresponsive at times. While overall navigation seems fast enough, and I have no complaints about the Silk browser, opening apps is sometimes slow. I can click something on my home screen, wait a few seconds, and it doesn't open. I click it again and it opens right up. Now is that just poor timing on my part? Am I pressing it too fast to register? Am I trying to click between apps too fast? I don't know. But I often have to press things twice to get them to open. Again, like with the power button, it may just take some time to adjust to having a tablet and not trying to click between apps too quickly, but it can be annoying. And thinking about my iPhone, where I often inadvertently open apps if I barely touch them, I don't know which is worse. Too sensitive (like the iPhone) can be annoying. But not sensitive enough is too.But all that being said, overall the Kindle Fire is a great device. Neither of those two gripes make me wish I hadn't bought it, and in the case of the power button, I've learned where not to put my hands (and like I said, a case might help with that). Regardless though, I love the Fire! I don't think it's an iPad killer, but I don't think it's supposed to be. What it is is a great media/web/email device. I often wonder how many iPad owners just wanted a web/email device to begin with, but didn't have any other legitimate or worthwhile options. Well, now you do.", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "A Good, If Not Great, Device", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2W4MN9D6JD311", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I went into this purchase with an open mind.  Unlike some of the 1-star reviewers I never expected the Kindle Fire to be an iPad \"killer\" or even an iPad replacement.  Amazon was pretty much upfront about what this device is meant to be, which is a device designed to consume mostly Amazon content.  When you look at the Kindle Fire from this perspective it's a good device.  I've used all aspects of the device -- books, newsstand, apps, music, video, and web -- and each of them has their positives and negatives.BOOKS:  there's not really a lot that could go wrong with a built-in e-reader especially when Amazon has had the same type of reader app on several other devices already.NEWSSTAND: This is one of the downsides of the Kindle Fire.  I've downloaded a couple of magazines and found the experience less than enjoyable, but I also haven't found it to be much better on the iPad.  I doubt I will find much use for this option.APPS:  I already had several apps purchased previously on my Android phone and all of them were available and ready to use when I took the Kindle out of the box.  Right now, Amazon's Appstore is a little lean on good apps, but that will change in time.MUSIC:  I made the switch to Amazon Music and Cloud Player several months ago when I purchased by first Android phone so I already had by cloud drive full of /music.  From minute one all of my songs were available to listen to over a WiFi connection with Cloud Player.  The Amazon music selection isn't as large as iTunes but it's a rare occasion when I can't find something I want and as long as the iTunes song isn't DRM I can upload it to the Cloud Drive.VIDEO:  A minor hiccup here.  My home internet connection is 1.5Mbps and it seems like neither the video player nor Netflix will work with it on Kindle Fire, yet when I have a faster connection -- at least double my home connection -- they work just fine.  This is a bit of letdown for me but I can live with it.WEB:  Now here is one of the bigger negatives so far.  My experience with Amazon Silk has not been all that great.  Pages that load almost instantly on the iPad take much longer with Silk.  Based on other reviews I've read Amazon is saying this will get better as more people use the app, but considering the hype surrounding Amazon Silk this is a big negative for me.All that said, I have to say I'm mostly happy with the Kindle Fire.  If you go into this knowing what you're buying I'd say most buyers would be happy, as well.UPDATE 11/19/2011:  So I've been using the Kindle Fire almost nonstop since I got it.  I've encountered none of the issues that so many 1-star reviewers are writing about.  I had no problem updating to the 6.1 software and zero problems with wireless connectivity.  In fact, I've connected the Fire to my home wireless, work wireless, a university wireless, and two mobile hot spots with zero difficulty.  I'm also getting very good speeds (at least according to Speedtest.net). I also don't get the issue with weight.  Unless you have problems with your hands due to a disease or an accident I can't see how it's too heavy to hold in one hand.Due to the problems stated above with web browsing (better, but still clunky) and magazines I can't change my 4-star rating, but if I could give it 4.5 stars I would.  For the price of $200 this is a great little device.", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Room for improvements.  Needs better prefetch", "Author": "M. McFall \"Yay interwebs\"", "ReviewID": "RG1ZYK1W88IF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After the initial joys of unboxing and once the new Kindle Fire owner turns on their device, they will be met with some issues that may leave them a touch unsatisfied.  The most glaring of these is the lag.  One of the first things I tried after booting up (and waiting for the update, along with a lengthy reboot), was to start playing some of the music I had residing in my Amazon Cloud drive.  With music playing in the background to accompany my Kindle Fire experience, I decided to do some multitasking and take the Amazon newsstand for a test drive.Amazon's magazine newsstand has a lot of attractive covers to peruse, but once it came down to me scrolling down to look at more, that's when it hit.  Rather, that's when it stopped.  The device came to a complete stop and there was a 20 second hang where it wouldn't even take inputs.  I don't think it was the connection, as I was sitting right next to the wireless router.  After the hang, I tried scrolling more.  Again, more hangs.  This is not a smooth browsing experience.  I exited the store and decided to see if it was evident in other areas of the device.Amazon videos, Amazon shopping, Amazon music....these apps all had a ragged scrolling issue, along with input lag and unresponsiveness, particularly when fetching new data.  I tried the new Silk browser...oddly enough, no lag or hang ups at all!  I could be wrong, but I think some of the lag in some of the Amazon apps is related to how they are programmed to prefetch data.  They just doesn't seem to be doing any prefetch at all.Multitasking on the Fire, particularly when streaming media/music from the cloud drive is an issue.  The problem with this is that Amazon is heavily advertising the cloud storage/streaming aspect of this device, in lieu of having a lot of onboard or removeable storage.  One relatively simple function shouldn't be having such a huge impact on other areas of the device.  I have a Kindle DX, which I love, and know all about input lag.  I'm used to it on the e-ink device; it's an affect of the technology.  But on a dual core Android tablet?  It's just not acceptable.Now that I have just about all of the glaring bad out of the way, the good is that overall, it is a nice, tidy little device.  It feels very comfortable to hold and use.  It feels valuable.  The screen is beautiful.  The stereo speakers don't sound like a speakerphone and actually have detectable bass. The interface is very intuitive and absolutely un-Android-like.  There is a lot of potential in this inexpensive tablet and I am eager to play with it more, seeing what Amazon has in store for it.  Most of the issues I mentioned would seem to be fixable in OS and app updates, which I anticipate in the coming weeks.  If you can get past these niggling issues, then by all means, be an early adopter!  Fair warning though: the lag will put a damper on your new gadget euphoria.", "Date": "November 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Going back.  Very frustrating.", "Author": "EmR", "ReviewID": "R1UXCCRMI0EOWJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I received my Kindle Fire via the mail early this afternoon and have been playing with it for about 6 hours.  For the most part I have been frustrated to the point that I have to put it down and walk away from time to time.  It is fatiguing and I find myself using my laptop more and more, instead of learning more about the Fire.  I am finding the touch screen difficult to use.  While browsing the stores or surfing the web, sometimes I must \"tap\" the screen several times, or harder than I thought would be necessary. At other times the screen is so sensitive that I continually open up links or items in the stores unintentionally.  I was trying to scroll through movie titles in Amazon Prime and kept unintentionally opening pages of the individual movie descriptions.  Very irritating. The \"carousel\" on the home screen is equally maddening.  You are supposed to be able to \"tap\" the different icons on the shelf and open them...well...it's not so simple..I find that I'm pushing very hard and not getting anywhere...and the icons won't stay still while you are trying to tap them.  It's like shooting ducks in a gallery. Also, while trying to enter information into fields...as in trying to log onto web sites...I had to tap on the field quite hard and over and over. Same problem with re-sizing the image and tiny print...whoops...I hit another link and now I have to go back to the page and find my place. It's also a good bit heavier than I thought it would be. I can't imagine spending long periods of time holding it up to read a book.  I did try, after considerable \"tapping,\" I managed to download a free book.  I quit watching after a few minutes because of eye strain.  The bright white background was extremely irritating to my eyes...not what I expected from a kindle. I think that I will sit here tapping away and reloading pages while softly cursing my Fire for a few more hours...then I'm probably going to package it up so I can send it back.  I would only recommend this tablet to those that have a lot of patience and a good sense of humor. Sure, it's only $199...but it just might be a fact of life that you get what you pay for.  I think I'll go for the iPad instead.Update:  I'm done, It's been another day of frustration with this touch screen. I wouldn't recommend this to anybody. I would either recommend either a conventional kindle for books,or an iPad if you really want a tablet computer.  My finger hurts from tapping and pusing so hard.  I've printed a return label, reset it to factory defaults and packaged the Fire up so I can be done with it.

I own an iPad and the Kindle Fire could be the baby version to the iPad. Visually the screen is so clear and crisp. There are many features to discover. When your 1st start it up Amazon will download the latest software and then install the software. It takes about 5 minutes. You will go thru the process of setting up the time zone etc. It instantly recognized my router. I typed in the pass word and I was online. It took about 30 seconds. I downloaded the Netflix app. OMG, the movies look and sound great. The volume is not as loud as an iPad but it is sufficient. The free Prime membership movies look great! All of my books were already downloaded. There are many different fonts and viewing methods for reading a book. At the top of the home screen press the \"sun looking\" icon --- this is where you control volume,brightness, turning on wi-fi, sync and more. I only played with it for 15 minutes and currently it is charging. On the home screen is the word \"Docs\" go there and there is the guide to use the KF. From fresh start up until it downloads a website---- it's about 30 seconds.  If you can afford  $200 BUY IT!!!!!!!! As I stated in the beginning Amazon could have charged much more.

I thought it would be good to use it in the kitchen to browse recipes, in the living room to browse or relax with a movie, or read a book before bedtime.  The Kindle Fire does all of these and more.  The email application is very good, although if you sync too much, Amazon blocks you.  So if you are an extremely busy person with emails flying in and out, you'll have a problem with the fire.  But if you simply sync once or twice an hour, that's no problem. The email application works well with my Yahoo account AND with my MSN account. Yep, you can sync with multiple accounts on the same email app.  I don't know why amazon doesn't make that a feature of their menu instead of an embedded app is a mystery to me, but it works good, really really good! I give the Email App an \"A-\".The photo application is good.  The best way to use it is to email yourself a photo and use the email app to download it to your Fire.  Once the photo is saved to memory, the photo app will automatically read the photo.  So far I haven't figured out a way to make folders or categorize the photos, but the app is fine. I give the Photo app a \"B\".  It would be nice to see a Flickr app for the fire that would solve that problem, although you'd need a Wifi connection which isn't always available.Of course the movie application is embedded in the fire, and its simply amazing.  If you like movies, the fire is totally for you!  I am a movie buff, and the Fire satisfies me in every way. Purchase movies on-line, see the movies on your fire with streaming capability, or simply download them to your Fire when you are out of WiFi range.  On my lunch breaks at work, I watch movies and everyone is always looking over my shoulder to sneak a peek.  The movies play very smoothly, there is no jitter, freezing or skips when playing a movie from memory.  I'll give it an \"A+\" on the movie application.  In fact, you may be tempted to toss your Netflix membership for the Amazon Prime membership as I have done.  HOWEVER, realize that streaming movies to your home computer or your streaming capable TV from Netflix is not nearly the same experience as streaming from Amazon.  I have a 12 meg connection and I have never had a problem streaming a movie from Netflix.  I have freezes, stops, and more issues regularly on Amazon.  It appears that they have a server capacity issue with popular movies, which can be frustrating.  My hope is that Amazon will put a little more attention into the TV and Computer movie apps as it has done with the Kindle Fire movie application.The embedded music application is good.  Its shows titles, artists and albums.  It would be  nice to see an equalizer function, but the sound reproduced with an optional set of ear buds is quite good and plenty loud.  I give the embedded music application an \"A\".The embedded Internal Web Browser is fine.  The touch screen is just about the smallest it can possibly be, and still be functional, when using your finger as a point and click mouse.  Everything else on the browser is functional but nothing to write home about.  You'll gravitate to apps rather than browsing for this reason, but thank goodness there are plenty of apps. I give the browser a \"B+\"Hardware:  The internal speakers are poor, sometimes I can't even hear them and really, there isn't much point in actually having them there since I can't hear them.  I give the internal speakers an \"F\".  Get yourself a decent set of headphones or ear buds and you'll be fine.  The Fire's operating system crashes about once a month I give that a \"C\".  Its easy to reset, not really a problem.  The touchscreen is not perfect, it doesn't always read your finger, and with no optional keyboard currently available, well that's a little silly.  But, its not a huge issue, I just usually leave the application, re-enter and it reads my finger fine on the second try.  I only run across this problem once a week.  I give the on-screen touch capability of a \"B\".  The screen picture however is an \"A\".  The case of the Fire is a work of art, I give it an \"A+\".Optional Applications:  There is a vast array of apps.  And yes, there is a really good one for Spreadsheets and Word Documents.  There are applications for magazines, some really good, some just plain lame.  I absolutely love the USA Today application and highly recommend it.  Also The Weather Channel has a decent app. The Facebook app is crap.  It's not correctly configured for the screen size of the Fire and the programmer of it should be put out to pasture.  You'll find it so frustrating that you'll simply use your computer or even an app on your streaming TV would be leaps and bounds above the Kindle Fire Facebook app. The Facebook app gets an \"F\".  However I will give the availability of apps a \"B\" overall.Accessories for the Fire:  When I first got my Fire about 4 months ago, there were only a few covers for it, and even fewer on Amazon!  I did end up with an awesome leather cover that also serves as a stand.  I also found a really nice neoprene zipper top cover when I take the Fire to work.  I am very disappointed in sync cables that are available.  To me that's silly and obviously a problem with the Fire.  Amazon, please please please, just make a BLACK (not white) power cord/sync cord combo.  My fire is black, not white.  I am a techno geek, I dont work in a hospital!  White?  Really?.  Further, I have heard horrible reviews about the quality of your cables.  The rant on cables is now over.  Next ... there are no keyboards available that's dumb too.  In fact, if you search for accessories for the Fire on Amazon, you'll get a list of covers a mile long, but not much else.  To me it would seem a marketing goldmine with all the Kindle Fires out there.  So, that's an unsolved mystery to me.Overall:  The fire is awesome, and yes, there are a few things that tic me off about the fire when it comes it, but I still love my Fire.  No, I cant program a website with it.  Nor can I take my camera memory card and read pictures from it, nor can I edit them.  But it comes back to the original reason I purchased the the Fire, and it satisfies those 100%.  And for only $200 bucks, what are you waiting for?", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire fills a niche other tablets do not", "Author": "Cheryl", "ReviewID": "R2RLR8QUWU4ZPH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I pre-ordered the Kindle Fire and was anxiously awaiting its arrival.  However, I foolishly panicked when I read some of the critics' reviews.  I tried to cancel the order, but it was too late.  I couldn't back out, but now I am so glad my timing was off!First, some background about us.  Other than the purchases we've made from Amazon, we have no affiliation with Amazon whatsoever.  My spouse and I, with our computer engineering (hardware and software) degrees, were doomed to become gadget junkies.  Our children (ages 12 and 14) have been cursed with our affliction and have also become tech junkies.  We have computers, tablets and phones from a variety of operating systems:  iOS (Apple), Android, RIM (Blackberry) and Web OS (Palm).  Each gadget and each operating system has its pros and cons, of course, and while there are rabid fans of each who will vehemently defend their favorite product/company and vengefully and single-mindedly attack any competitor, I'd like to think we are rather objective, given our diverse collection.Despite my initial fears, the Kindle Fire has rapidly become one of our favorite tech toys.  It's versatile, easy to use and fills a niche that our other gadgets do not.  Every gadget has its faults, though, and we do have suggestions for the Kindle Fire 2, if Mr. Bezos and company are listening.  Now, on to the review:Size and weight.  The size and weight are ideal for reading, working, playing games and for holding the tablet in one hand for an extended period of time.  Another plus about the Kindle's size involves my irrational fear of robbery.  When I'm carrying my larger gadgets in their special cases, I'm always concerned about making myself look like the perfect target for a would-be robber; the cases are like a shining beacon announcing to the world that I am carrying an expensive gadget.  For the prices they charge for those gadgets, it would be painful if they were stolen!  The small size of the Fire allows us to discreetly tuck it away.  My daughter carries it in her purse, for example.Apps.  Amazon's free app of the day feature has saved us a considerable amount of money and headache on our android devices, and it continues to do so for the Fire.  You can try a game or app, and if you don't like it, you can remove it from your device with no money out of pocket.  If you do like the game or app, you'll like it even more because it was free.  Amazon allows purchasers to download all apps without additional charge to all the person's devices, so all of the apps we purchased for our phones are also on the Fire (however, you can choose to keep the apps in the Cloud, rather than download them onto the Fire).  We do use the official Android Market on rare occasions, but it is becoming less frequent as the Amazon market continues to grow.  I know there are those who complain about the \"low\" number of apps available (about 10,000), but I honestly don't understand the complaint.  Granted, my Apple devices have a lot of apps loaded on them, but the number of apps in iTunes is almost too numerous, and a large percentage of them are repetitive.  It takes a fair amount of time just to wade through the sea of apps I've loaded on my devices, even with the help of the folders and the search function.  In order to search for the most useful or fun apps in iTunes, I follow several Apple reporters on Twitter/Facebook or use apps that navigate through the endless ocean of new apps for you.Video.  Amazon has a huge selection of movies and TV shows available, and with your Kindle Fire comes a trial of Prime, which gives you free, unlimited streaming of over 10,000 movies and shows.  The movies and shows I've watched are clear and smooth, and the selection is much better than I expected.  I spend a large amount of time away from wi-fi, so I download the movies onto the device and watch them later.Books and magazines.  I've read several books on the Fire already, and it has been a pleasure.  Many people prefer the e-ink readers, but I've grown so accustomed to bright screens that I find reading with e-ink readers to be difficult.  No doubt I'm odd in that regard, but in my defense, my spouse and children have had no difficulty reading books on the Fire.  I've had no problem reading graphic-heavy magazines, either.Web.  The speed at which the Fire surfs the web is more than adequate.  I haven't noticed a huge difference between the speed of our phones and the speed on the Fire.  I used it this morning to edit one of our websites with no trouble at all.Music.  In addition to the music we obtained from Amazon, I copied all of our iTunes music into Amazon's free cloud service so we can listen to all of it on every device we have.  The sound on the Fire is clear, and it is loud enough for everyone in a relatively quiet room or car to hear (you probably can't hear it in the midst of a loud party).  Amazon's selection and prices are outstanding.  They frequently have sales and free songs or albums, and none of the items you purchase or download from Amazon count toward the 5GB of free Amazon cloud storage.Price.  It's hard to beat the price of the Kindle Fire.  At $199, it's affordable for most families, and if something goes wrong, the loss of $199 is easier to swallow than the loss of the other devices we have.  In our family, the low price makes this the only device to use in certain circumstances.  My son uses the Fire while tutoring differently-abled children.  My daughter is a volunteer naturalist at a state park and uses the Fire's apps to help children identify and learn about birds and other animals.  In both cases, the device must be used and passed around by a group of young children.  My children love it, the children they are teaching love it, and I don't have a coronary watching the Fire make the rounds; the Fire is tough and has stood up to rooms full of rambunctious children.  If it ever loses that fight, it's inexpensive enough to replace.Now for the cons.  It would be nice if the power button were on the top of the device instead of on the bottom.  I accidentally hit the button twice the first day I had it.  I'm used to it now, but I would still suggest that Amazon move it on the next build.  A physical volume button would be nice, but it's not a deal breaker.  Adjusting the volume using the screen is fast and easy.  It would also be nice if the Fire had Swype.  I can \"type\" extremely fast on the devices that have Swype; typing on my Apple devices and on the Fire seems quite slow by comparison.  Those who are accustomed to the one- or two-finger poking-type of typing won't notice a problem.  For some people, the lack of a camera is an issue.  I don't miss it at all.  The Fire is not quite as smooth as the iPad, but the difference is not very noticeable.  It would also be nice to have a micro SD and battery accessible to the consumer.Conclusion: The Kindle Fire is easy and fun to use.  It works as a great introductory tablet for a novice, or as a portable, carefree addition to any tech junkie's collection.  Everyone in our family is quite pleased with it.  Would I buy it again?

This is a new box, with an easy to open strip. Inside is a white plastic holder with the Fire prominently displayed. It comes wrapped in cellophane like material and is easily opened. Much to my surprise there is only one small card with instructions on how to get started. The power cord comes wrapped in its own package. You must charge your Fire, connect it to the power cable, and then connect the power cable to a wall outlet. Press the power button on the bottom of the Fire and it turns on while you are charging the Fire. It took about 10 minutes for the Fire to become completely charged. The instructions for Wifi are very easy and the complete assembly takes minutes. All of the applications download, and then it is yours to access. Mine was completley registered since I have the second generation Kindle, and Amazon used that information.There is a few minute orientation to the Fire, and then you are free to explore. The Icons are on the top, Newsstand, Books, Music, Video, Docs, Apps and Web. I tapped onto each application and tried them out.Newsstand- there are several magazines that give you a month's free view- easy to download. They will try to sell you a subscription, but it is easy to wait. I have Vanity Fair and The New Yorker to see how I like them on my Fire. I have both in subscription form, so the hard copy is delivered to me.Books- All of the books I have on my Kindle are here in the Fire, so I will read, Diane Keaton's new book on the Fire, to see how different it is from the Kindle.Music- No music yet on my cloud, but will download it.Video- I have Amazon Prime, so am looking forward to viewing many of the films.Docs- Have not sent any documents to my Fire as of yet, but it looks quite easy.Apps- There is quite a vriety of applications to download, free, so far I have downloaded the Weather, Amazon and ESPN.Web- Very easy to use-a list of web sites and you can add your own quickly.There are icons for sound, brightness, Wi-fi, sync and more.  I have set up my email, facebook and twitter accounts.I am so pleased with the new Amazon Fire- it is all as advertised and more. I did not have expectations that it would be an iPad. What I wanted was a tablet that is easy to use, ease of applications, fun, great color and sound. I am looking forward to more exploration.Highly Recommended. prisrob 11-15-11Kindle Keyboard, Wi-Fi, 6\" E Ink Display - includes Special Offers & Sponsored ScreensaversKindle, Wi-Fi, 6\" E Ink Display - includes Special Offers & Sponsored Screensavers", "Date": "November 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Returned the Kindle Fire after only one day", "Author": "Brent Wilson", "ReviewID": "R34QWOJI7Q9PWW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I'm normally *very* happy with Amazon products and customer support.Kindle Fire doesn't support proxy servers making it a brick at work.

And the integration with the Kindle for PC to grab my highlights quickly and drop them into a Word doc is a great way to integrate reading and research into producing output.The weakness of the e-ink kindles is in handling pdf's and web site content. So I was interesting in test driving a Fire to see how much better it is able to cope better with those formats.First off- newspapers. Disappointment there as my Times of London subscription didnt download to the Fire automatically and it wasnt in the bookshelf. Looking into it I see that the Times isnt available for the Fire; and in fact that seems to be the status, at least currently for a number of papers such as the WSJ. I'd imagine this will change in the future but at launch its NYT, USA Today, Post and a much thinner collection than the regular Kindle.I did download the Economist to see how it look on the Fire and the color and clarity of the text is good. It would be a very good magazine reading experience and convenient on the go. However if you can selected highlight text, export it or tweet it like you can on a regular Kindle, I couldnt figure it out. Disappointing, as one of the main things to do with magazines is save of a tidbit of knowledge so you can find it later.For e-books I tried two samples- a Cisco router config guide that was about 600 pages in color, and a scanned version of \"A Ride to Khiva\" by Fred Burnaby from 1877. There are a large number of interesting books that exist only in scanned form or in such a error filled OCR mobi conversion that reading them on e-ink is a major pain, so being able to read them on the Fire would be a positive boon.The kindle automatically opened the cisco document in the Kindle for Fire app and legibility was excellent including on the drawn images and photos. Navigation is done by sliding the pages across or by the progress slider. Major bummer in that the Kindle app is much less full featured than Kindle for PC- you cant highlight or export sections. Major downside for technical reading.I then downloaded and tried the Adobe Reader app, MobilePDF viewer and the Documents to Go (free) pdf viewer from the Amazon App store. Checking googles android store there appear to be a lot more pdf viewers out there but they are not available for Fire. Going through the cisco pdf was most comfortable on the adobe app, although the markup ability was still limited. Mobilepdf required hitting tiny arrow keys to turn pages- ugh quite a comedown after the paddles on a e-ink kindle. Legibility was good on both. The PDF to Go app required purchasing the full app to open such a large document.On \"A Ride to Khiva\" it was a mixed bag. The Adobe app posts an \"out of memory\" message and exits. MobilePDF is unable to render any page content. PDF to Go Free version is unable to do anything but tell you to buy a full version. The Kindle reading app just renders the pages as smears. There is a \"read online\" version available through archive.org and that did render legibly and was useable through the Silk browser although the paging controls are a pain.The other thing I'd like to use the Fire for is browsing the web when I am out at a cafe and taking notes. Obviously the lack of a bluetooth keyboard is a major bummer there, HOWEVER I notice that in hardware reviews elsewhere (theverge.com)that there actually is a bluetooth chip in the Fire, which lends me sufficient hope that it will be eventually turned on, either officially or unofficially.Last note is that the Fire would be a good gift device for a non-tech savvy relative. The out of the box is as easy as pie and there is no computer required so its perfectly plausible that someone with no wifi could stop by the library or McDonalds, get the download of the daily paper or books you lend them, check their email and be off.I am keeping my Fire although for the things that this review is centered on its a 3-star experience. Since most of my gripes are software based I hope that things will improve to a better experience- at the very least newspaper availability should. If you are reading this in 2012 you may want to check for what pdf apps are now available in the apps store and if keyboard support has now been hacked in.", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "A capable tablet for the money", "Author": "Colby D. May", "ReviewID": "RZU2ACBLDDM88", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "ONE YEAR IN...AN UPDATEI got my Kindle Fire for Christmas in 2011 and now that I've had it for a year, I thought I would update my initial review. I have deducted a star based on the limitations I have encountered along the way and how they have impacted my enjoyment of the device.I read somewhere that the Kindle Fire should be treated as a basic Kindle reader with some extras thrown in, and that pretty much sums it up. Here's what has bothered me the most:1. Limited app selection. There should be an easier way to access the vastly superior selection of apps available at Google's Play Store, but alas that isn't possible. Why Amazon handicaps the selection is beyond me. Perhaps they're trying to force developers to optimize their apps for Kindle consumption, but so far it seems they're having none of it.2. The email application stinks. Not compatible with Exchange. Does not thread conversations. Limited compatibility with some cloud-based services. I understand that some of these issues were fixed with the second-generation Kindle Fire, but...3. Out in the cold for truly useful software updates. We're stuck with what we got and if we want the basic functionality that should have been initially present, we'll have to buy new Fires. No dice, Amazon.4. General crappiness of Android tablet apps. Exacerbated by gripe #1, above.5. No calendar app.That said, this device CAN be enjoyed if one is able to dismiss these limitations and take it for what it is: a color-screened e-reader that provides some extra functionality beyond the conveyance of books and periodicals. Living in a household with iPhones, iPod touches and iPads, however, it's easy to get iEnvy and begin to resent the limitations imposed by Amazon on what could have been a very, very good device.ORIGINAL REVIEWI received my first Kindle Fire on Christmas Day, but unfortunately it had a defective touchscreen which necessitated a replacement. Amazon handled this with reasonable swiftness and made the process pain-free. Kindle Fire #2 arrived on December 29th. Having owned and used extensively the Fire for over two weeks now, I think I'm ready to comment on its performance and my experience with it.It's probably easiest to break this down based on the categories one sees across the top of the Kindle Fire's homescreen...***Newsstand***I have not yet purchased any newspapers, but have purchased a subscription to the magazine Car & Driver. Getting the subscription started was a hassle. When I set up one-click purchasing on the Fire, I elected to use my Amazon Store Card account. Afterwards, when I attempted to purchase the magazine subscription, the Fire presented me with an error indicating there was a problem with my Internet connection, which certainly was not the case. It turns out the real problem is that magazine subscriptions must be charged to branded credit cards, such as Visa, MasterCard or American Express. I consider this, then, to be a glitch in the device's programming in that it cannot produce the correct error message to match the actual problem. In any event, a trip to the Amazon website on my nearby computer solved the problem, and I was soon browsing through the latest issue of Car & Driver.C&D; is one of what I'm guessing are many magazines that are available in Page View, meaning it's a virtual copy of the printed edition. This has advantages and drawbacks. If one is particularly enamored with a magazine's unique layout, then this will be a welcome format. At the same time, one can only zoom in so far on the material, so there are limitations with the text size. Additionally, one cannot enjoy reading the text and glancing at the pictures on the page at the same time--zooming in and out is required for that. Thankfully, Text View is available for this magazine, which renders the text in a much friendlier format for those used to e-reading. I would assume most if not all other Page View-enabled magazines have Text View as an option, but it's probably worth checking before buying.***Books***I have completed reading one book on the Kindle Fire and it was a pleasant experience. There's really not a whole lot to elaborate on here. The user can select font size, typeface, \"paper\" color, text color, line spacing, margins...and probably some other aspects I have left out. It's very easy to find a format that works. My only real gripe with the Books function is its inability to report actual page numbers to mark one's progress through a book. Instead of page numbers, you get a percentage with a location number. While the percentage is actually pretty useful, the location is not.One thing I am looking forward to trying is the Kindle Owners Lending Library, which is part of the Prime membership that I will purchasing as soon as my trial membership runs out.***Music***I don't really use this component of the Fire's functionality so I won't say much about it. I will say that the limited amount of music I have purchased via Amazon appears in the device's library and plays from the cloud without issue. I anticipate I will be using Music more in the future as my Amazon-sourced music library grows.***Video***Video on the Kindle Fire is just swell, especially if one is a Prime member. Compared to the early days of Amazon Prime Instant Video, the selection available to users now is very impressive. It's not difficult to find something of interest to watch, and the material streams from the cloud with virtually no problems. I have not yet rented or purchased a movie--quite honestly the prices to view movies and TV shows in this manner are expensive. If I wasn't a Netflix or Hulu member, my opinion might be different, however. Video was one of the features of the Fire I was looking most forward to, and the device doesn't disappoint.***Docs***I haven't really explored Docs at all. The only file present here is the Kindle Fire user guide, which came preinstalled on the device. If my intentions for the Kindle Fire were more business-oriented, I suppose I would find more use for Docs. But I have computers for such things--the Kindle Fire is serving as an entertainment and media consumption device for me, and I see no need to re-task it at this time.***Apps***This is an area in which I have been pleasantly surprised with the Fire's capabilities, once I learned what was necessary to get the most out of it. After using the Fire for a couple of weeks, I have learned the best methods for getting apps onto the Fire, and realize that some people are going to have more difficulty that others with this process. If you own an Android phone--more specifically, a rooted Android phone--you're going to have a very easy go of things. My phone is a Droid X, rooted, with Root Explorer installed. I also have an app called Dropbox installed on the phone--this is really the key to smooth installation on the Fire. Once one gets Dropbox installed on both the Fire (which needs to be open to installation of outside applications) and a rooted Android phone, everything is a piece of cake.Now, there are apps that won't run on the Fire no matter what, but there aren't many, and the ones I have installed through sideloading generally work very well. I have been surprised, however, that many apps I thought I would have to sideload are actually available through the Amazon App Store. It is growing, and their free-app-a-day gimmick is quite good. I have a very nice selection of apps on my Fire now, which enhances its functionality and enjoyment.The apps that come with the Fire out of the box are really just OK. The email app works fine...but I really don't use any of the others, like Pulse, IMDb or Audible. Irritatingly, they cannot be removed by the end user...unless you're willing to root, which I am not with this particular device.***Web***Others have complained in reviews about the Fire browser's speed, but after following a simple piece of advice I read in several places on the Web, everything was peachy. It is this: go into settings and turn off accelerated web browsing. That's it. After I did that, the Silk browser became very, very peppy using my middle-of-the-road wireless-G in-home networking of a Road Runner connection. That said, Silk worked pretty well even with acceleration turned on.Silk renders pages well, usually makes the right choice when choosing the proper site for optimized viewing on the Fire, and is easy to use. Frills-free and that's cool with me.Other random thoughts:* The speakers are very good for their size. They don't play very loud--and in my opinion, they shouldn't as this is a personal media consumption device--but they provide good range and I can even hear hints of bass every once in a while.* I have had no problems whatsoever with Wi-Fi connectivity. I know this is a bone of contention for many users and reviewers, but my experience has been trouble-free. Perhaps it was something addressed in updates...I cannot say for sure as I have not used a pre-update Kindle Fire. But as it stands, it's flawless.* Count me among the folks who get annoyed with the options bar in apps that are not completely optimized for Kindle Fire. This is the bar with the arrow on it that must be tapped to access ANOTHER bar with the actual navigation controls.* I have loaded one movie from my personal collection to the Fire and it plays without a problem. To access movies loaded in this manner, one must launch the Gallery app to find it. It is also my understanding that the Fire only likes smallish files in .m4v or .mp4 format. To be fair, however, I don't think this is a great way to use the Fire given its somewhat meager storage space.* It MUST be mentioned that, without a Prime membership, I believe I would not be nearly as ecstatic about the Fire as I am now. So one could say the price of a Prime membership should be added to the price of the device to arrive at a \"real\" cost to get going in the Kindle Fire ecosystem.As more things come up, I will update my review.Bottom line: for two hundred bucks, this thing is MORE than capable of providing its user his or her money's worth. It really is a stroke of Amazon genius and a real, viable attempt to move their content ecosystem into the realm of Apple's seemingly exclusive domain. I am REALLY enjoying my Kindle Fire and provided most folks understand what it can and cannot do from the get-go, they should not be disappointed either.", "Date": "January 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perfect for the certain user...", "Author": "H.

I just happened to give him a Samsung Galaxy tablet, so in the last couple weeks (we did gifts early) I've had the opportunity to compare my Kindle Fire with my husband's Galaxy. Both run on Android, but they are decidedly different.The Kindle Fire has a platform of it's own, it runs Android, but in it's very own unique way. I'm a homemaker with two children and a small crafting business, and I've found that the Kindle Fire is the *perfect* tablet for me. My husband, on the other hand, is a business man who works with sales and his own clientele. He's found the Kindle Fire to be lacking for him but the Galaxy tablet to be perfect for his needs.This is not to say that the Kindle Fire is only a watered down tablet for housewives, quite to the contrary, I just think you can to consider your needs when purchasing a tablet computer. I've been very happy with the Fire's level of versatility and completeness. But it is a smaller tablet, at only 7 inches, and runs a simpler platform that other Android or Apple tablets.That said, I will say I've been so happy with the reliability of my Kindle Fire compared to my husband's tablet, which has already required a master reset due to complications. The Fire, while very inexpensive compared to it's competitors, has been a very reliable piece of technology. The Galaxy has already required maintenance. I do wish the Kindle Fire accepted Google apps, this is the one major disappointment of mine. I hope they update it to change this in the future but I have little hope for it...I would definitely recommend this tablet for the \"light\" tablet user-- those who need a basic but trustworthy machine. I think it is revolutionary when you consider the price, and perfect when you have basic computer needs.", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "It Does What It says", "Author": "Randyman", "ReviewID": "R1GW135ZTX8AFG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have to admit...I was extremely cautious when looking into purchasing a Kindle Fire. I read many professional reviews and then at least 200-300 customer reviews before making my decision. I bought one. Why? When the reviews are so mixed? Well...it is obvious that these reviews fit into many categories, APPLE fanatics who dont want this to impact their beloved IPAD sales and those that want to compare it to an IPAD, Barnes and Noble faithful who are passionate about the NOOK, people who want it to do more than what it is advertised to do, techies that want to let you know nothing that sells for $200 can be worth it. All I can say is it does exactly what it was stated it could do and does it extremely well for a reasonably priced device. Seriously, if you love Apple then purchase an IPAD, it is a proven tablet but this is not an IPAD, it is not even a brother from another mother. If Barnes and Noble is dear to your heart...get a Nook, from what I understand and read a perfectly fine device. I am not a huge Amazon person, I dont make alot of purchases from them (some e-books), I am not a Prime member (testing now with the 30 day trial), I do have a Kindle Keyboard I purchased 2 years ago and was very satisfied with it for the same reasons I state above, it did what it was advertised to do.Into the Fire ....I am not going to write a detailed review of the functions, I have read many others who have done a much better job of describing each and every function of this product than I ever could. Lets suffice it to say I have been using it for 1 week, I am running the latest firmware (6.2) and I have not experienced issues with scrolling, hanging, wireless, or any of the other major complaints I have read about. I would go into a few of the specifics but my wife has taken it to work with her so I cant even describe some of the settings (although I did have lunch with her and she did let me play Angry Birds). It was painless to setup, reading on it was fine (although for genuine reading you cant beat the E-ink screens of a standard Kindle), games are crystal clear and actually fun, I streamed some TV shows (ex. Original Star Trek --Doomsday Machine) and it played flawlessly, tested some movies which also played fine and did some internet browsing as well which was not perfect, but this is after all a 7in screen so you have to do some adjusting to see the page content clearly sometimes. As for the internet speed it was perfectly fine, I am not counting tenths of seconds like I have seen some reviewers do, lets just say IPAD is usually faster but it is so minor not worth complaining about, I am not using this as a full time Internet Browser anyways. So it must be perfect right? ....Well..The Stars tell the tale....why not 5 Stars? Well...this is a first generation device and is obviously not perfect. I agree with some of the detractors that have listed some issues that really need to be addressed by Amazon, mainly but not limited to...*Purchases ...fine, so easy to make them, hard to stop them. I know they want you to purchase Amazon goods, but seriously, anyone can pick up this device and start spending like they found your credit card on the sidewalk. I know you can lock it with a password, but you still have wide open access to children who may or may not accidently start buying things since there is no control. Fix #1 would be simple, just make it so you have to enter your Amazon password when buying things, make 1 click optional or Fix#2 Have another profile on the device like Guest or something that is locked down so it cant install, purchase, changes settings or even optionally turn off web browsing for this profile.*Organization...uh..guys...it is a Kindle after all, why cant I organize my books by Author etc? Modifying the carousel would be nice too, it can get real junked up quickly.*Space...I understand the Cloud technology, and so far I am pretty pleased..but oh what a difference a few more Gig on the Fire would have made, just saying going forward it would be nice to have just a little more space for growth.Wrapping up....so after 1 week I can say that I am very satisfied with my purchase. I had intended to wait for the next version of Kindle Fire that is supposed to be larger and maybe have more features, but then I noticed that Amazon appeared to be responding quickly to issues and has released 2 updates in the last month with a 3rd one on the way soon. They appear to be serious about this product and are standing behind it, even the people who are complaining and returning them say the return process was smooth and no hassles from Amazon.

I find the Kindle Fire to be a great device, almost perfect for students, but unmanageable and unrealistic for schools in its current configuration.  I have an idea that would work for our school.  It is my hope that Amazon will read this post and listen.  I believe that Amazon is missing a HUGE market.  With a few changes, the Kindle could become an amazing and economical choice for schools.My Idea:  Something I call the \"Kindle School\" based directly on the Kindle Fire.Current Kindle Fires could be used extensively in an educational environment with some software changes.  Some Hardware changes, such as moving the power button, adding an external volume control, or a video out for connection to a projector are not discussed.  I hope for a version that would be much quicker to market than a radical rework such as say a Kindle Fire 2.  I am about to drop several thousands of dollars on netbooks simply because the Kindle Fire is just not quite ready for schools.  Ipads are out primarily for lack of Flash support  and secondarily for cost issues.  I have listed what I think would work.  Feel free to comment, make changes, or correct me where I am wrong.1.  The Fire needs settings to block addition and deletion of apps.  Multi-level settings- block all, allow free apps only, add apps only, etc.  An added ability to set a password to change app settings/store access.  Use of multi-level passwords to protect settings.2.  A setting to block certain apps, such as Facebook and Twitter.  While these may be blocked by the network, an extra capability of blocking particular apps would be extremely useful.3. Folders/collections to group subject matter/apps/books.  This is needed so that students can find apps, etc. by subject matter.  For example, a folder named science would contain apps downloaded for science classes.4. Easier to find and read documents, especially those read by third party apps such as Quickoffice.  Kids cant easily find the documents.  Word, Excel, text, and other docs should show up in Docs the same way pdfs do.5. Improved on-screen volume controls6.  Reset feature based on a configuration set by the administrator.  This would allow the administrator to wipe and reload apps and documents easily.  The admin could create a single image that would be used to reset the Kindle to a preset configuration.  This image could be uploaded to a pc, or better yet the Amazon Cloud, and then sent to multiple devices at once.  The admin would then simply use a sequence of click and a password to \"flash\" the Kindle.  Similarity/Familiarity between devices is extremely important for classroom management.7.  Lots and lots of educational apps.8.  Google Earth.9.  Multiple Kindles on one special school account separate but related to an existing Amazon Corporate Credit Line.  The school account could be used to administer which types off apps and books could be downloaded.  For example, allow only free apps, educational apps, or by a rating scale based on content.10.  Inability to delete browser history without an admin password.11.  Ability to use proxy settings.12.  Parental controls.13.  Ability to print to network printers.14.  Some type of designation that would appear on the lock screen to identify a particular Kindle.  This would ease management and allow teachers or administrators to easily identify who left which Kindle where.  A sticker on the back works just as well but is easily removed and not nearly as cool.15.  An icon that could be used to drag and drop locally created documents to the cloud so that a teacher could retrieve the documents for grading, etc.16.

Overall I am very impressed with this little tablet. My 4 star rating should not be viewed as suggesting it falls short in delivering what Amazon promised. It excels at what it is supposed to be used for, and only lacks some of the features found on tablets that cost 2 to 3 times as much. For the money, this is a 5 star tablet, but it would be wrong to ignore how it stacks up with the rest of the market, so it has 4 stars.My points after about 10 hours of use over 5 days:1. Memory is not an issue because of the Amazon Cloud. Don't let anyone tell you it is. A year down the road, this and other cloud services will be the whole game apart from the software and UI on each device.2. It is quick! It frequently does the same task as my iPad 1 more quickly. It cannot match my Moto Xoom nor my wife's iPad 2, however.3. Best uses: videos, books, music, games.4. A little work needed: browsing and email.5. Silk is fast given the installed memory. I have yet to have an issue with waiting too long.6. The Carousel--which is the most prominent feature of the immediate interface--is WAAAAAAY too sensitive. Fix this now! That said, I like the combination of the Carousel and the bookselved favorites below. It's genius in most respects apart from the difficulty of getting the exact icon on the carousel you want to open, open. In addition, the menu bar at the top is very easy to use and takes you to everything you need to do, fix, figure out, etc. So turning on the Fire and just taking off into it is very easy except for the Carousel's sensitivity.7. Build/physical design: OK. It's not snazzy at all... but not clunky either. The 7\" form factor is part of the reason for this because it hard to be small, thin, and heavily optioned, but I suspect we'll see a big improvement in this aspect of the device with the Fire 2.8. Weight: Again, OK, but that's mostly because it's a 7\" machine, not a 10.1\" machine.9. Accessories: Excellent selection and price range. You could spend $50+ for a cover, or do fine with one for $13.10. eReader: Amazon's Kindle app is excellent, but is definitely not the same experience on all machines. It doesn't always sync progress, including higlights, bookmarks, and notes across all of our tablets and eReaders (in our case, Amazon, Apple, and Android devices). It should. Some reviewers talk about how this is a good eReader, but certainly not as good as the Kindle. I disagree; I prefer to read on the Fire because it's a good reader, and there's a whole world waiting for you when you're tired of reading.11. Favorite: Watching video! OMG! I watched \"You've Got Mail\" (an older video) on the Fire, and it was unbelievably good (and FREE with Prime)! I swear it looked like 3D. Seriously, it was so sharp my eyeballs started bleeding:-)12. Least Favorite: Except for the size of the app market on Amazon and the fact that not all Android apps are available... Well... Nothing, really. Listen folks, this device is only $200! It plays with our iPads and Xoom and holds its own every time.13. Fire or Nook Tablet?: Lots of reviewers are going down this road. We bought both. The Nook is a slick machine. It does video like a champ is also a great eReader, it has some useful external buttons, etc, etc. The best reviews all say the same thing, however: it depends on what you want to do with the tablet. There is no \"better\" between the two. There is just a difference, and the Amazon environment with Prime added is way, way ahead of Barnes and Noble, IMO. In addition, unless you buy an extra micro sd card to store what you want on it from places other than B&N;, you've only got 1GB of memory available for your personal use. The rest is only used for things you buy from B&N.; Didn't know that when I bought the machine. Had I, I wouldn't have. That's not cool.14. Conclusion: OK, it's not an iPad, but that's not why we bought it. We could not be happier with the Fire because it delivers what it says it will do and it's only $200! Don't forget the Prime Mempership. I know I sound like a shil for Amazon, but I've been a Prime member quite a while, am a heavy Internet buyer, and there's nothing like Prime. Not even close.

Yes, I had a few issues with the same things other reviewers have complained about such as the location of the power button and accidentally advancing/retracting pages with screen edge touches.  Yes, it does take a while before you learn how long to press the screen to open an app or select other functions. Other things users whine about don't bother me, such as the volume control or the inability to download Prime video to the device or the lack of a memory port.So it's not perfect.  But how about we look at it this way:In the past, Amazon sold thousands of Kindles for $150 or more that people are perfectly happy with.  These devices only served to read books.  Yeah, I know about the experimental browser, games and music but, let's face it, those features were awkward at best.  Now what if I told you that, for $50 more, you could have a device with a color touch screen that also supported a large collection of useful apps, played music loaded on the device or from the cloud (including streaming music services), played video including Netflix and Hulu+, displayed magazines in color and allowed you to surf the web in a meaningful way.  All of this with an intuitive interface and fast performance (well, except for the browser, but only on occasion).  Wouldn't you think that is a tremendous bargain?  A no-brainer, as they say?Well, that's what this is.  So, for everyone expecting this thing to perform like a $1000 laptop or even a $600 iPad, either grow up or go buy a different device. Enough whining already!Seriously, I've used iPads, smartphones and other tablets and, for some tasks, there is no substitute for a computer.  As consumers, we need to stop expecting such robust functionality from portable devices, especially at this price point.Amazon, I'm not letting you off the hook - not requiring a password for store purchases IS remarkably stupid and there are numerous software improvements I'm sure you're working on to enhance the experience.

Very simple to use, all my content downloaded instantly, videos download in a few seconds and stream seamlessly, and it registered me instantly. The brower is very fast -- those who say otherwise are either just wrong or have a slow Wi-Fi connection.  All in all, it does exactly what was promised, and does it well as far as I can tell so far.Important to note: all the content you have on your Amazon.com account/in the cloud shows up on the Fire. So, let's say you have a book with a racy title that you're reading on your other Kindle -- an icon for that shows up on the Fire, and there's nothing you can do about it short of deleting the book from your account entirely so you can't access it any more.  Same thing with video.  Same thing with web pages -- once you open one, it shows up in the carousel, and you can't delete it. So, if you're planning to share the Fire with your family or friends, make sure you want to share all your content too.  Amazon, please fix this! Please change the software so that icons can be deleted without deleting underlying content from the account.Another significant flaw: if you are not going to have access to wi-fi for any length of time, you are in trouble with regard to video rentals. Without wi-fi you can't stream, so you have to buy or rent videos.  If you rent a video, the rental period does not begin when you _start_ watching the video, it begins when you _download_ the video. So, if you are going to be without wi-fi access for a week, or maybe you don't want to pay expensive hotel fees for wi-fi, you can't download a video and watch it more than 48 hours later. Thinking maybe you'll just pop over to Starbucks and download the movie there? It takes quite a long time to download a movie, so be prepared to wait.

The browser works very well, and it is speedy.  Five months after its introduction, the Kindle Fire has plenty of good apps and the operating system is smooth.  I actually prefer reading on the LCD screen compared to my e-ink Kindle because the contrast is wonderful and the text is crisp.  I like reading the Kindle Fire with ambient light in the room. E-ink requires direct lighting beaming down on that screen, which annoys me at night.  I would have paid for more memory, but I don't plan to use this as something that holds my entire music library.  I stream my movies and TV shows via the Netflix app and maybe, someday, the Amazon's own streaming service.  For music, I use the Pandora app.  The Kindle Fire has brought a very good tablet down to price point that many of us can afford (I got it as a birthday present from my wife).  There are times I could use a larger screen, but then there are times I appreciate the portability of a seven inch tablet.  I have seen the new iPad and the screen is lovely.  Nonetheless, the Kindle's screen is very good, and I see no reason to pay another $300 for an iPad.  The Kindle Fire feels solid and not cheap by any means.  Amazon has walled the Kindle Fire from the rest of the android market--and this may not be a bad thing.  I trust the apps in their market place, and that is important to me.  The kids are playing games with it.  I may look at a few games myself.  The keyboard is a bit small because this is a 7 inch tablet, but to be fair I was having issues with the keyboard on Apple's iPad as well (I use an ergonomic keyboard).  I don't see myself typing an essay on it.

I'd skip the silly one star reviews from people who returned the device 5 minutes after opening the box - like anything, there's a bit of learning curve, and the Fire may do certain things differently than what you are used to. Also note that this is not a budget Ipad, and many of the apps that make sense on a phone-sized device won't be practical on the Fire.I own an original Kindle, and the Fire will not replace that device for reading. I much prefer the E ink display when reading for long stretches at a time, the only exception being viewing .PDF files (see below).I bought the Fire primarily because of all the free/low priced Android apps, and I also wanted a small device for quick web browsing.The Fire is well constructed and was easy enough to add to my network.I wish I could say that my first impressions of the whole Fire experience were good, but they were otherwise:Product Delivery - If they haven't changed this yet, I want to add my voice to the chorus - For the sake of your future customers, Amazon, please don't ship a pre-registered device in a box that basically states : \"Contents: One Kindle Fire - Please Steal Me!\"Keyboard - The virtual keyboard works ok, but even with a stylus, I still get an \"o\" when I swear I entered a \"p\".You can turn off auto spell check, but there is an annoying ribbon of suggested words that appears at the top of the keyboard when you type, and I haven't found a way to disable this feature and for some reason it really bugs me. In some apps, certain words I enter at the beginning of a sentence STILL auto correct to a word I don't want - I don't know if this is a problem with the app or with the Fire.PDF Document Handling - As I said, Fire won't replace my E-Ink Kindle, but Amazon's promotional material led me to believe that the Fire would handle PDF files with aplomb. My experience was that the native PDF reader on Fire is not too good, the Adobe reader was worse (!). I finally found a paid app, ezPDF, that works halfway decent. This may not be a fault of the Fire directly, but as Amazon promotes this device's ability to handle such documents, it should ship with the most robust PDF reader available.Basic Tasks - Fire's approx. 5x7 size makes it wonderful for certain tasks like web surfing, creating virtual  flashcards, sketching and games, but \"mobile-centric\" apps that make sense on a smaller Android device (phone) will be less useful - as a guy, I won't be taking my Fire on shopping trips or to the restaurant. Might work in a big purse, though.*****Web Surfing - Fire's Silk browser works well for short jaunts on the Web. Very handy to have a device that I can quickly boot and surf on. If I need to power surf, I'll boot up my laptop.Movie/Show  Watching - I didn't buy the Fire for this, but test-viewed a couple of streamed videos that were free through Amazon Prime. For a 7\" screen they looked fine - as the Prime library expands with more quality titles, this will certainly add value to the Fire.Music - I didn't buy the Fire for this either, but test-listened to an MP3 I had purchased from Amazon. The tiny speakers are pretty good for what they are. For better sound, the headphone jack handled my full-sized headphones with no problem.Games - This is what saved the day for me. For the cost of one Nintendo DS game, I've purchased tons of wonderful games, and I still have over 4Gb of space for more.For all my gripes, I admit that I've been using the Kindle Fire for at least a half hour a day since I received it about a month back. Warts and all, as an entertainment/learning device, the Fire works for me.

WELL", "Author": "J. Vizzini", "ReviewID": "R28DYNN4ITC41B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So I did it, I bought a Kindle Fire. And I must say I'm not sure why there are so many negative reviews. If you understand what the device is, it does what it is supposed to do very well.What it is:  1.) A media consumption device, and this is what it excels at.  2.) A BACKLIT e-reader, if you understand this then you wont be disappointed, if you want an e-reader only, definitely look at the E-Ink Kindles. I personally read in bed and backlight doesn't bother me, I have an e-ink reader and finding light can be very annoying.  3.) A CASUAL Email device - it isn't for enterprise or heavy emailers and don't believe it is meant to be. But for just casual checking emails it performs well.  4.) A web browsing device. The silk browser is much faster after update 6.2 and I can only imagine it will get better.What it isn't:  1.) A laptop replacement. It wont replace your laptop or desktop, infact I would say no tablet out there is capable of this.  2.) AN IPAD - I can't believe people actually compare this to a device that is 2x as much and bigger. But even that being said I would rather have this then an iPad. The 7\" form factor is much more portable for a media consumption device. If you want a good comparison it should be done against the Nook or even the Galaxy 7\" TABS.. but those are significantly more money.  3.) A wireless 3G device. Why do people think that Amazon would give free 3G access to the internet and video streaming? The only reason other Kindles have 3G is to download books.. that's it. Amazon I believe pays a carrier for this access and the bandwidth required for thousands of Fire users streaming video would eliminate any profits, it just isn't feasible. I think this is just lack of knowledge on peoples part.I wanted a device that I could access with WIFI since most places I go have this, and I don't want to pay extra for a data plan. It is perfect for my needs, media consumption, web surfing, and checking my emails when I want to lay in bed or sit on the couch. I don't think it is an effective WORK device, it is a leisure item and that is how it is marketed.NEGATIVES:No device is perfect and I am sure the fire will improve over time with software updates. But there are a few things Amazon should address:  1.) Parental controls! The fact is many people buy these for there kids and the fact that there is no parental controls is kind of a head-scratcher, on the Kindle Fire purchase screen at amazon.com they show a kid playing with one, so to say this isn't targeted as a family device is crazy talk, in the ad they even say:\"Kindle Fire is great for parents and kids. Stir your child's imagination with over 1000 beautifully-illustrated children's books, including favorites like Brown Bear, Curious George, and Circus Ship.\"Kids will be handling these devices and the 1-click purchase requirement is dangerous, in addition to the rated R movies. This is toted as a family device.. just like the beloved IPAD. Parental controls should be in there, and I am sure Amazon will listen. Also there should be an option for a pin on one-click purchases, what if someone accidentally presses a button while checking out your Kindle. This needs to be fixed and there are plenty of people who want it.  2.) Power and Volume buttons... this is the biggest fop-ah that Amazon made with the hardware, the power button is a poor design that is too easy to accidentally push, can't really change that in V1, but hopefully V2. (this is not a deal breaker, but it is an error.) There is NO external volume button, this is an odd omission on a media device like this, maybe there is a software tweak to make the volume more easily accessible.While I do mention the negatives.. no device is perfect and for a V1 device it is great.. but most importantly it works for my needs. But if you are considering purchasing this device, make sure it will provide the expected experience and needs you are looking for.

I just recently decided I wanted an e-reader and spent days researching the different kinds and deciding what exactly I wanted from it.First of all, I absolutely love to read so reading was my #1 priority.Next, I have an Amazon Prime membership because I am a student so the Kindle lending library sounded perfect. Also, being able to stream free movies and TV shows through my Kindle seemed like a pretty good deal too (which I have done already and while you do have to give the video a few minutes to load (press pause and let it load), the quality is fantastic.)All in all, I chose the Fire for many reasons:1) I wanted an Amazon product first and foremost because I am an Amazon Prime member and frequent user. So Kindle was my obvious choice,2) I chose the Fire specifically because it fit my expectations of what exactly I wanted: primarily an e-reader with some tablet functions available,3) I don't care about not having a camera or HD connector, especially considering all that I'm getting already for $200 and4) I prefer the color version vs. the other Kindles because I wanted the ability to read magazines and children's books with my niece and nephew. Plus I read a lot at night and rarely read out in the sunlight so I did not need the e-ink display. I may eventually change my mind and just buy the $79 e-ink display Kindle for outside use.The Kindle Fire was the best choice for me personally. As long as you do the research and evaluate your expectations, I think the Fire will be a great product for whoever buys it. If you're expecting a full-fledged tablet that works anywhere and everywhere (so far, I know my Kindle works at both home and work, I have yet to try it at school), I would say look elsewhere. Perhaps an iPad or Samsung Galaxy would suit you better. However, if you're looking for a low-priced e-reader with some extra perks and you use Amazon frequently, I would say the Fire is your best bet. I'm in love with my new Kindle and can't wait to explore every aspect of the Kindle store.Also,I know people have complained a lot about:1. the carousel: If you're planning on sharing your Fire with someone and do not like the lack of privacy, I wouldn't buy it. However, I will be the only one using it and have password protected mine (top options- more- security- password) so the carousel is not an issue for me.2. lack of camera: like I said, I do not care about the lack of camera. I have a digital camera and a nice camera on my phone. Plus, including a camera on the device would have upped the price. No complaints for me there.3. Yes the video takes a minute or more to load but this is true for every video on the internet. Have you ever had to pause a Youtube video and let it load before you played it? Answer: Yes. Have patience.All in all, the Fire is a great buy as long as you do the research, know exactly what you are getting, and do not expect it to be a tablet.Hope this helps :)", "Date": "November 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "I knew exactly what I was purchasing", "Author": "T. Evans", "ReviewID": "R27FXSGY2V4L6Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before I begin, I have used an iPad and various other tablets, but never could bring myself to buy one.  Features important to me are the ability to watch videos, surf the internet, play fun apps, listen to music, read the occasional book, and of course upload some personal documents.  If I bought an iPad I would not have gone with 3G, so 3G is a non issue for me.  I also really have no use for a camera (I have a great camera to take great photos with) or gps (I have it in my car and hardly use it).  I researched this device and knew of its storage capacity, knew of the features it had and did not have, and have read quite a few reviews after the product was released.  So instead of an in-depth review, I would like to say why I love this product and common misconceptions and concerns about the device that I see in many reviews.Linked to Amazon, having Amazon Prime, and the ability to access the cloud makes this device absolutely perfect and I absolutely don't see reason to have a larger hard drive for my own personal needs.  I have loaded a handful of songs, books, apps, and a few videos and still have over 5gb left on the drive.  I have no problem removing and adding things as I need to.  And I love the fact that no matter where I go and connect to the internet, I have access to everything!  Adding to that, this device has now made me start purchasing music and videos through Amazon as it allows me to have free cloud storage, where I can access on multiple devices that I already own.  Prime is a must with this device as it allows for instant video, book lending, cloud storage, etc.Lack of 3G was a huge known if people would have looked at the product page or the millions of \"iPad killer?\" articles on the internet.  I have had this device for several days and have yet to use it outside of the home or anywhere without wifi.  I do not wish to pay an additional monthly charge to rarely use 3G and if I am in such a need for 3G I have a phone that can get me to what I need.The browser is not as fast as Amazon makes you believe it is and this may change with more use, however, I am completely content with this.  It works for everything that I need it to.The appstore is limited to some extent, however, it has all the apps I love such as Cut the Rope, Angry Birds, Netflix, Logmein, etc.  I am not a huge app person so not having access to hundreds of thousands of apps is no problem just as long as the big ones are there.  On that note, however, I am patiently waiting for WatchESPN to be added as that would make this device absolutely perfect.  The plus side to Amazon appstore is that everyday they offer a FREE app!  I used to think they would just offer only cheap ones for free, but no all of them are fair game and it rotates from gaming apps to technical apps (e-mail clients, list apps, etc.) every other day.Videos are not high definition on here, but they work and still look good, not great but good.  I don't watch tons of videos on this, but when I do I have had little problems with this.Music is solid and the speakers work quite well actually they sound better than my laptop speakers.  Even my fiancee who is by no means interested in electronics even said \"wow, the speakers are really good.\" I was surprised by this.Now to what others are saying is wrong with this device:The 7\" screen is too small:  I knew I was buying a 7\" screen and this started to concern me so I went to Bestbuy and actually tested out 7\" screens and found out they really aren't too small.  I love its size and have found it preferable to the iPad and larger screens (maybe around 8\" would be better) as it is more portable and I can carry with one had no problem.  Text on some items look small, but it zooms in and out quite well.  For those complaining about the magazines and newspapers, when you zoom in you really have to be pushing far off the page to get it to flip.  I have zoomed in several times and had the other page start coming in and it does not flip the page it sticks to the one you are on.  It can get tedious for some, but I find it keeping me reading everything as I have to be more active with the page.The carousel highlights personal material:  The carousel does have EVERYTHING you have purchased on it and yes EVERYTHING no matter how many items you have.  It does sort it by recent viewing and no it does not display each internet website you visited, only the last one as it considers the web an entire application.  This can be difficult for many people who don't want others to know about their more romantic novels or websites they visited or perhaps even their embarrassing game they love.  This one for me is not a concern, however, for many it can be so this one is to be taken under consideration.Can't delete preloaded apps or any purchased material:  You actually can, however, since it was preloaded it will be stored on the cloud.  When browsing through the Videos, Music, Apps, Newstand tabs it begins by displaying what is in the cloud (which is everything you have purchased) whereas if you go to the device it will be erased and only display those on the device.  This is more of a misconception rather than a real issue.  If you did not like a particular purchase then it is understandable because I am not sure exactly how you even erase such an item off the cloud.  This is more of a back and forth issue depending on what your complaint is.Lack of security and one-touch payments:  The Kindle can be set with a password to access it and that can be done through the settings.  As far as linking your identity to the Fire, well Amazon stated this prior to release and has done this with every other Kindle you purchase.  This is a way for Amazon to make this product feel like it is only yours (which I personally like).  There is no threat of identity loss or anything like that.  The one-touch payment is a little problematic especially for those that are giving this to children.  I myself am not so it is non issue for me, however, for others you can go into your settings and change this with a few clicks of the mouse or touches on the screen.  Amazon's customer service about accidental purchases has been wonderful to me as I have accidentally purchased a couple books on my Kindle 3G and they refunded and removed the product within 24 hours.Clunkiness, bad keyboard, slow, dull, etc.:  I have found no problems with the keyboard at all, if you use an iPhone or any other phone with a digital keyboard this one is quite simple to use and I have rarely received the wrong letter with I did not make the mistake myself.  Many are concerned that this product is heavy, it is not even a pound, however, I will not compare this with the heavier iPad as it is larger and therefore usually requires two hands to hold which reduces the overall feeling of its weight.  This is a one hand product and I have used it nearly nonstop since I have received it and have had no problems or soreness from holding it.  It really is not that heavy and I might be a little concerned if people are finding it extremely heavy to hold.  It is slower than the iPad and some other more expensive tablets, however, I expected that with $200 and it really doesn't impact my tablet or experience at all.  I am used to using a netbook, which is slow and frequently bogs down, this is a HUGE improvement.  Although it doesn't slide or scroll fluidly at all times, I have no qualms or reservations against that and in fact, expected it when I purchased the Fire.  I think the Fire looks great, I love the look of it especially in comparison to the Nook Tablet, it is sleek and this is more of a personal opinion, but I think its great.  Other people have mentioned that it frequently doesn't respond to touches and it has never had that problem with me, but then I gave it to my fiancee and she was having extreme difficulty.  It seems you have to push down as if it was a real button and not just tap it quickly and gently.  Sometimes it does not respond to some commands such as going back and I do have to push it a second time, but this is no way frustrating or ruining my experience with the device.Overall, I LOVE the Fire and it is exactly what I wanted in a tablet and I knew what I was purchasing before I bought it.  I did not envision an iPad killer or even competitor, I envisioned a media consumption device (primarily Amazon content) that does just about 80% of the functions of an iPad for nearly a quarter of the price.

And have a large music collection in their cloud.I have an ipod touch which I love for its portability, but it was never any good to watch streaming live soccer games or movies. I found the screen too small. The obvious choice would be an Ipad.. but I could not afford that and also was not an itunes music user.So I was excited when I heard about the Fire. Was slightly slow to preorder. As the days approached, I noted others had now received their devices. I had been a tad wary when amazon demoed the product earlier and was wondering why most people were not allowed to hold or touch the device. So I read the reviews.. BUT I concentrated on the negative 2/3 star reviews here. I had in the back of my mind that if things did not look good now that real people had the device, I would return it..Having read several hundred negative reviews ( I ignored the 4/5 starred ones), I think I was ready to return it.. or at least I had a list of complaints from users I wanted to see for myself.So the device arrived. Turned it on, self registered, up and running within a minute. I also noted an immediate software update that I installed. I went through each section in turn and for every complaint bar its weight, I had no issues with anything.Here is my short summary of things I liked:  It did everything I wanted to do.  Videos played well, the interface was much better than the roku/tv/pc apps I had been using  I streamed some ESPN3 soccer content. that was perfect too.  I downloaded some tracks from the cloud and played them fine.  The volume was good and had a rich sound. I had no problem with 2 speakers at one end  I downloaded a few books of mine. Used the reader. Had no issues with page turns or anything.  The app selection was good enough for what I needed. Netflix,Tunein, Pandora and others were there  Games played fine.  The email app worked well.  The silk web browser was fast to me  ( and I test software for a living). Youtube was fine. I could stream commentary from my UK soccer teams site and stream from acorn online with no problems)  I could not find anything that I could not do that I expected it to do.I expect there will be a lot of new apps on the way. I expect Amazon to come out with a new version next year..But for me its what I wanted and it does it very well.Wishlist:  I would like to see a better email app/facebook app?messenger etc but they will come I am sure  I wish it was slightly lighter, but I made a quick stand for it and works wonderfully well ;)Thanks for reading.", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "A great tablet -- with the awesome Amazon infrastructure behind the scenes!", "Author": "rickh57 \"Rick Hale\"", "ReviewID": "R3NOOWJ1EVTVO4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased my Kindle Fire, Full Color 7\" Multi-touch Display, Wi-Fi today at Best Buy.

I've become accustomed to it on my phone and it definitely speeds up input and going back to a more generic virtual keyboard seems very slow.The Fire was extremely easy to set up.

But the Kindle Fire really isn't going to fill the bill.  It's nothing more than a special purpose Tablet computer and for the price I would just as soon buy a Tablet.What I don't like about it:1.  It's heavy.  After about 15 minutes or so of holding this, your wrists and arms will really start to feel it.2.  Display.  Gorgeous full color.  But not really suitable for reading books.  If your interest is a e-book reader, you'll be much better off with an E-Ink model. And I can't even imagine attempting to read a magazine on this thing.3.  Web browser.  Works OK. But because of the small display a lot of web pages are hard to read even when looking at it in \"landscape\" orientation (sideways).  For some reason, some web pages don't permit you to scroll down, so you can't see the entire web page. This is probably caused by some sort of bug in the Amazon \"Silk\" web browser software, but just a guess on my part.4.  Touch screen.  Works pretty good, but sometimes you have to tap several times to get a function to work.5.  Speakers.  Reminds you of that old AM radio you used to have.  Zero bass. Yeah, I know, you're only going to get so much out of tiny speakers. Your earbuds will be a necessary accessory for your Fire.  (the equalizer may cure some of this, but I never got around to testing it after running into my lockup problems detailed below)6.  Document reader.  You get your documents to the Fire by emailing them to your @kindle email address.  Unfortunately, the document will download to the Fire only when you turn it on the next time (yep, this is what the Help files say).  So to actually read your document after emailing it, you need to shut it down and restart it.  (you can also move or copy your documents by using a USB cable - not included and available at extra cost. Hint: the cable that comes with your cell phone will probably work with this).Which brings me to the deal killer which had me packing it up for return:7.  Lockups. I emailed a .PDF file to my Fire and after shutting the Fire down and restarting it the document finally started to download - and never finished.  It's stuck in a download mode and I can't get it out.  On your personal Kindle page you can view your download Que, but there is no way to delete a document from the Que.  So this document is stuck in Downloading mode and there is no way to delete it.  So right there on the Carousel there is a big blank page with \"Downloading\" in the middle of it forever and ever. This leads to the Fire locking up and becoming non-responsive requiring a shutdown and restart (complete with that big blank page attempting to \"download\" right up front and center). And that's assuming you can get it to restart. I had problems with the \"unlock\" page on the startup.  Attempting to swipe the yellow arrow to the left (to unlock the unit) resulted in the arrow snapping back to the right side of the page and failing to unlock. Another shut down and restart usually cured this malady.What I like about it:1.  Easy to set up and get running right out of the package.  Virtually automatic registration with Amazon if you already have an Amazon account.2.  Great display - just not suitable for an e-reader.This is an OK piece of hardware, but not worth the price in my opinion.  If you want an e-reader, don't go this route.  Purchase one of the cheaper Kindles with e-ink.  Your wrists and eyes will thank you.

I've been a Prime member for years.I also own an iPad, which I think it too heavy to carry around all the time so I was very much looking forward to the Fire. Therefore, I'm disappointed to report that while I've only had the Fire a few days, virtually nothing that I tried with the device has worked without problems. Some of these issues will improve (I hope) as the App Store improves, but others are just inherent in the device.I'm comparing a lot of these issues to my iPad experience. I know that it is not supposed to be an iPad, nor do I expect it to be for $199, but I would suggest that users put the $199 toward buying an iPad instead. $199 is too much to pay for a device that doesn't work well.Plus:- Minimal set-up required since it was already linked to my Amazon account.- Amazon Video looks phenomenal.- Facebook app works fine.Minus:- Can't zoom to change text size (as far as I can tell) and text can be quite small. Not a big issue if you are 20 or 30, but I'm in my 40s and at the reading glasses stage of life, and I know a lot of Kindle users are older than I am. My husband can pinch and zoom on his Android phone so not sure why it doesn't work here.- HORRIBLE App experience to date. Hopefully this will improve, but none of these are issues with an iPad:- Can't link to most of my print subscriptions- I've tried New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and the Economist and all expect me to subscribe a second time. Apple fixed this months ago, and I can read print subscriptions on my iPad with no extra charge.- Could link to Vanity Fair but only have one old issue is available, not the most recent one in the app. Why??- USA Today has a phenomenally good app for free on the iPad, but Amazon App Store expects you to pay $11.99/month for a subscription. Why??- I've searched for most my favorite apps and virtually none have been available (or at least I couldn't find them): No Google Maps or Yahoo Maps, No Twitter, No Yelp, No HBO Go, No Slingbox app, No Super Why (4 year old nephew's favorite app), No Toy Story 3 (another kids favorite) or any other Disney app. I'm running out of apps to look for.- Netflix video was choppy and fuzzy.- Yes, Angry Birds is there, but what AB fan wants to start over again at Level 1?- I started to read a book on my Fire, turned off the device, and went upstairs to my regular Kindle, expecting it to sync to the furthest page read---- but it didn't!- Other \"Web Pages\" are the mobile versions, so just a list of headlines like you would see on a Smartphone. With an iPad you can see the web page. This makes the iPad an immensely better experience if you are looking at newspaper sites. While I have not been able to view many newspapers that I read(since I'm not paying twice for something I already subscribe to), I suspect that given the small screen size that if I were to get a NYT or WSJ app they might also be headlines, not the newspaper-like versions I see on my iPadSo as much as I would like to recommend the Fire as a low cost alternative to an iPad, I just can't. Save up and buy an iPad instead. And if you read books, buy a regular Kindle not the Fire. I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 2 since I expect the apps to appear sometime in the future, and because iPads are quite pricey so can't really suggest that everyone buys one.

Unlike the iPad which feels like a metallic-plastic combination and makes this really irritating scratching sound (kind of like a long hissing sound) when it slides on a table (there is no traction unless you get a case!), the Kindle's velvety backside make it grip on tables better and is quiet.The screen is also great. Really strong glass so it doesn't scratch, even when I put it with notebooks that have metallic spirals rings and with keys.It is fast! It sometimes runs faster than the android phones. Hasn't lagged so far.Web browsing seems flawless. Connect and surf.As for storage, 8GB is definitely not small. The cloud allows me to store books that i have read so that I can make room for new ones. Also, the Amazon Cloud allows me to keep the music I don't listen to off of the tablet and my watched movies go onto the cloud. What's even better is that I can stream it on my computer if I get tired of using the Kindle. The B&N; NookTablet can't do that.The only issue is that sometimes the words are too small, but that's probably because magazine have small font to begin with so shrinking down to a 7 in screen is not helping.Oh yeah, and with Amazon Prime, it beats having to pay more for Netflix.

After having it for a month, I am totally in love with it.  I can read in the dark, which is an awesome aspect as not to disturb anyone else who may be actually trying to get some sleep.  It serves as my nightlight during early am strolls to the fridge.  I can take it to every room in the house, fly with it, [it also serves as my alarm clock] take it to Starbucks-I find the Kindle Fire to be very portable and light weight.  I go on long walks with it, early morning and late evening, so I can read while I walk a predictable and at least partially shaded trail. Incorporating the Kindle Fire into my exercise routine was a major unexpected bonus.I can listen to music, Kindle Fire accepts my standard Bose head sets, watch a movie with dynamic definition, or use it for its core purpose-reading a book.  The only problem is I am reading a few books a week now-I cannot put the Kindle Fire down!  I find the Amazon prime membership to be a great value when it comes to securing more Kindle books because many authors, such as myself, are enrolled in free borrowing for Amazon Prime members program.  For that program there is no \"return\" date, so essentially free.  You can find out if a Kindle book is enrolled or not in the Prime program by looking near the payment button.With the Kindle Fire, for the first time in my life, I can check my Facebook, Twitter activity and answer my e-mail without getting out of bed.  I also love the fact I do not have to sign in each time, I configured my Kindle Fire to just remember the passwords.  The battery has always lasted through all of my extended uses, and I have never had a wireless connection problem anywhere I took it. The Kindle Fire is very strong in picking up wireless connections.  Speed is very good with almost any function, I live on line so I appreciate how important speed is.  I also like the fact my Kindle Fire always knows where I left off, what applications I use the most and what I may even do next!RESEARCH -  The Kindle is great for research and learning new words.  If I happen upon a word I find intriguing, I can press that word and a dictionary will appear.  I can also opt to search that word on the net.  I can book mark and make notes about that word.  Most importantly, I can \"search\" for that word through out the book which really saves me time when I am looking for something very specific.

This is not a $500 8gb iPad.  It is a $200 Kindle Fire.  Stop comparing the two.  Would you compare a Lexus to a Kia?  Of course not.  So why are you comparing a Fire to an iPad?First, yes all the complaints are valid.  The on/off button is in an awkward place.  The screen isn't the best for reading a book on for hours.  It needs an external volume control.  It is a branded shopping tool for Amazon.  So, now that we have that out of the way, let's talk about positives.1) It is $199 compared with $400 and $500 competition.  What you get for $199 is way more value than what you get for the $500 iPad.  (Amazon actually loses money on each one sold as it costs them more than the $199 sales price.  This is fact, not my theory).2) It connects to WiFi that works brilliantly.  The browser is fine for what you need it to do.  Sure, it is not Safari, but it does the job.3) Easily add music, pictures, etc. with a micro usb cable.  Now, that is something you can not do with the iPad.  This is huge to me.

Not to0 big, but not too small.Look, what are you expecting for $199?  Let me reemphasize again that Amazon loses money on each one they sell in hopes you use it to buy things from Amazon.  This means if you paid to have everything on this tablet made for you, with Amazon's volume discount, it would cost you more than what they are selling it for.  People must stop comparing this to the iPad or the Samsung Galaxy tab.  Those are $500.  This is $199.It is a perfect starter tablet.  It is not the iPad, but it is also 40% of the cost of the iPad.

However, some naysayers are complaining about issues that can easily be corrected:1.) Security: Go into \"Settings\" in top right. Turn on \"Lock Screen Password.\" Create a password. Then, hit the \"Back\" arrow, go into \"Display,\" and select time for \"Screen Timeout.\" Whenever you turn off the device or exceed the timeout, your password has to be entered. For additional security, on the home page, click on the \"Web\" tab. Then click on the bottom center icon that looks like a page. Select \"Settings.\" Make sure the \"Remember passwords\" button is not checked. You can also select \"Clear passwords\" as an option.2.) Power button location: Buy a Kindle case. I use the Marware jurni, which folds behind itself and has a hand sleeve. The Kindle snaps in perfectly, and the plastic tabs that hold in the Kindle have spaces for the speakers at the top. But, I imagine any Kindle case will do. You don't ever have to take the device out of the case, and you'll never hit the \"Power\" button until you want to.3.) Slow Web Browser: Your Kindle Fire is set by default to enable Flash, accelerate page loading (which actually tends to slow the browser), and give you a desktop view (basically treating your Fire like a desktop computer, which is a lot to handle for a small device). On the home screen, click on the \"Web\" tab. Then, click on the bottom center icon that looks like a page. Select \"Settings.\" Disable \"Enable Plugins\" (takes off Flash), disable \"Accelerate Page Loading\", and change to mobile view under \"Desktop or Mobile View,\" (which will give you mobile versions like you would see on your phone, should they be available). Silk will run faster, and, unlike an iPad, when you want to watch a Flash video, simply turn on \"Enable Plugins\" with a quick finger swipe.4.) Outgoing E-mail: If you're not using a mainstream e-mail provider such as Google, Yahoo, Hotmail, or AOL, you might have trouble with setting your Outgoing Mail Server, which loops a question about a certificate authenticity. Even though it costs, the Enhanced E-mail app does the trick to solve this problem. Plus, it has great features more like a desktop e-mail would have, such as access to folders and starring items. It also highlights what you haven't read.5.) Touch interface: Yes, there can be some lags, but you can quickly adapt by just holding your finger on the device a bit longer than an iPhone or iPad. It's worth a few bugs to be able to do so much on an inexpensive device. The more you use it, the more you'll unconsciously adjust, and you will think the device has magically improved.Great app: Handrite Pro: write on your Fire with your finger or a stylus, in any size, and it will convert it to a smaller size in your writing on a \"piece\" of notebook paper. You can also use a keyboard on this app.Would like to see: An alternative keyboard design app to get rid of the period being next to the space bar. Android already has these apps, so it's just a matter of time before we can have a similar app.Check out: On amazon.com, check out \"Kindle Deal of the Day.\"  On your device, don't miss the free books available in the Kindle Owners' Lending Library. If you have Prime, some great new books are free!  Access this directly on your Fire through \"Books\" and \"Store.\"Keep the faith in the Kindle! A few bugs will likely be ironed out in updates.

If you read these articles (New York Times, Yahoo News, etc.), you would think that the Fire is pretty much unusable and is a $199 paperweight.  However, these articles are not based in reality.I've wanted a tablet for a while now, but the prices have been outrageous.  There was no way that I was going to spend $500 plus for an iPad - you can buy a laptop for less and it will be able to do more!  There were cheap Android tablets out there, but they are an obvious case of \"what you see is what you get.\"  Therefore, when the Kindle Fire was announced, I was intrigued.  It was affordable to me and was supposed to do the things that I would use a tablet for: surf the internet, use apps, check my e-mail, listen to music, etc.  I ordered the Fire on a leap of faith based on the Amazon name.I have not been disappointed.  The Fire does all the things that it was supposed to do, and contrary to what the media says, does them well.I have heard various reasons why the Fire is a poor tablet.  For example, the power button is supposed to be in an awkward place that is susceptible to being accidently hit.  I have had this tablet for a month and have used it for hours each day and have never accidently hit this button.  Further, I have seen complaints that the Fire lacks a microphone and camera.  I am glad that it does not include these things - it would have driven up the price!  I never video chat, and even if I did, I have a laptop and a cell phone to do that on.  Last, people have said that the touchscreen is poor and that it is not easy to use.  Again, I have not run into too many problems here.  I've had to double tap items a few times, but that has been the extent of my issues with the touchscreen.  I have played many games that require you to extensively use the touchscreen (Cut the Rope, Slice It, Tetris) and I have never had a problem.  It almost seems like the media is making up issues to try to make this device fail.Let me end this by saying that if I had the money, I would have bought an iPad.  However, I don't have the money to spend on one (and I'm a lawyer!!!), and there are millions of other people out there that don't have the money.  The Kindle Fire should not be compared to the iPad, but it is a great tablet for what I use it for.  All of these articles/negative reviews miss that point.", "Date": "December 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wishing I had waited for the Kindle Fire 2, but am still happy with my purchase.", "Author": "Rifleman", "ReviewID": "R11DFLMAQSFQUI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "//***********************// Personal Review. //*********************//After having an Ipad at work for over a year, I decided to purchase a Kindle Fire for my own personal use and for some light work at the worksite.Three days in, the device has met my expectations.  I use it to watch movies during my breaks and play music while I work, play Angry Birds more than I should, and have even side loaded a app of my own creation for use in the field.  It is a Media machine, and in that field it shines.As a tablet, it works well, but the limitations are obvious to anyone who has ever used an Ipad.  The silk browser works okay, and the OS feels better than other android variants, but it picked up a lot of little quirks along the way in regards to the interface.  I found myself abandoning the upper 'recently used' carousel early on, as it filled with various media through the course of the day and was 'sensitive' in ways that managed to infuriate me as I flipped back and forth between apps. The on screen keyboard is okay, but it's layout limits it to quick emails and tweets only.  Trying to write a novel on this will only end in tears, and due to the lack of bluetooth or traditional usb, a physical keyboard is out of the question.That said, do I regret the purchase?  No.  Will I be purchasing the inevitable upgrade?  Probably. What will I do until then? Probably watch more Mythbusters on my Kindle Fire.//***********************// Statistical Breakdown //*********************//Breakdown by Category/Grade //*********************// Ease of Use: A- //*********************//Amazon, for the most part, got this right.  As of this writing, the system work, it works well, and aside from some previously mentioned quirks, it works.  The '-' is mostly earned by the quirky nature of the system (You'll be wanting to go to the 'Gallery' app to watch videos not downloaded from Amazon, not the 'Video' section) and the onscreen keyboard's layout. //*********************// Speed: B+ //*********************//Inferior to the Ipad in Speed, but not so much than it affected my daily routine.  Start up is slower if you shut it all the way down, but similar to the Ipad booting up from standby. The browser didn't impress nor disappoint, but all forms of media work well on this machine. //*********************// Physical Size: A+ //*********************//The small size makes it perfect for ease of travel.  Being able to shove it in my coat pocket instead of a bag has made my life simpler over the past few days, and I've had no issue reading any of my documents on it's screen.  That said, remember, this isn't an Ipad. The smaller screen is designed to make it more portable and personal, whereas the larger Ipad definitely has an edge in having a larger space to work with.  If you accept the size as a design choice rather than a flaw, the rest of the device will start to make more sense. //*********************// Memory: C- //*********************//Seriously wish it had a SD card slot.  8 gigs fills up fast these days, and I can't get access to the cloud storage at work which limits me to whatever I have on the Kindle Fire. //*********************// Apps: B //*********************//Not as big as Apple's store of the Android store, but most of the essentials are there. //*********************// Value: A //*********************//The Kindle Fire, provided you know what it can and can't do, is a excellent value.

Daniel \"Alex\"", "ReviewID": "R3IN61XAA6HTIQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Amazon's Kindle Fire has a price that is tough to beat.  The $199 price point should raise a few eyebrows and conjure up a healthy dose of skepticism.  Can there be a good tablet device for only 200 bucks?  It turns out, there can be, but this tablet is not for everyone.  The Kindle Fire is a very specialized device -- it handles a few things exceptionally well, but it has a set of drawbacks.  The most apt comparison that commentators draw are against Apple's iPad; it's considerably more expensive, but do you need all of its features?  Conversely, would you want to spend 200 bucks on a device when you would eventually rather have the more expensive ($500+ one)?Enjoy reading?  The iPad and the Kindle do these both exceptionally well.  The Kindle Fire has the slight advantage here though.  Amazon's Lending Library Program treats Amazon Prime members to a free eBook each month (and there's a pretty hefty selection to choose from).  If you are a Prime member, you will NOT be able to take advantage of the Lending Library on your iPad; you must have a Kindle device.  The integration is also exceptionally executed on the Kindle.  Apple's marketplace for books isn't nearly as accessible or competitively priced.  It may be important to note that the iPad has a Kindle reading application -- you can read your entire Amazon library on it (complete with synchronization and note-taking options).Live with Wi-Fi Availability?  In my opinion, the biggest drawback of the Kindle is its reliance on wireless internet.  Many of its features involve streaming services.  This option to stream content makes the device much cheaper, but it comes at a price.  The Kindle does not handle hosting content well, so it uses Amazon's Cloud service for most of its media.  If you live in an area without internet, these features will largely be unavailable for you.  The iPad, while also relying heavily on the internet, is able to play movies, music, and content much more efficiently without wireless availability.Enjoy browsing the internet?  The iPad has an advantage here.  The Kindle needs to draw from an external site to do its heavy lifting.  Accordingly, browsing can be a little slow (as your browser is technically handled by a remote server instead of an internal processor.)Additionally, the display screen falls somewhere between iPad size and HTC smartphone size.  The resolution looks great, but it won't make much of a difference whether you are watching HD or SD content.  Because of this, the device feels like it is a convenient way to consume media on the go, rather than an optional medium at home.  This lends the Kindle Fire to being smaller than typical tablets.  With an iPad, you'll generally be required to carry it in a tote bag or bookbag, but the Kindle Fire is small enough to fit in your purse.In summation, the Kindle Fire is a great device with limited audience:For media consumers on the go who have steady access to a wireless internet connection.If you are looking for a tablet that you will use for work, go with the iPad.  If you are looking for a tablet that you will consume a ton of media with offline, go with the iPad.  If you are looking for a great tablet to read with (including magazines and comic books), you can't beat the Kindle Fire.  I would also recommend the Kindle Fire over any of the other devices in the Kindle family.  Unfortunately, the Kindle Fire does NOT include E-Ink support; other members of the Kindle Family include this black-and-white text, and it is easy on the eyes and does not glare in the open sun.  The Kindle Fire DOES have a bad glare outdoors or in bright lights, but this is consistent with all other tablets.  While the battery life won't last as long as the black-and-white readers, the Kindle Fire has great support for colored images in books (and PDF's!)

At first, she was mildly disappointed, had wanted an Apple iPad and didn't think a Kindle could do much.  She played with it, though, and within a day or two we regretted giving it to her because she doesn't put it down now, she loves it.  She has a bunch of free and paid books and several magazine subcriptions on it, uses it for email, found that it has a GPS function that works even when it's not supposed to be getting a signal (but it does, not sure how), and looks up movie times, weather, train schedules, etc. via the Internet.  She uses apps to post and view photos and probably many other things we don't know about.It's a quick study to learn to use and our daughter loves it.  Hers developed a problem after about three months, could not charge, possibly the charger plug or socket broken, but Amazon has exchanged it free of charge and no hassle.  How a company deals with problems is at least as important, if not more, than whether it has problems or not, since everyone has some.An iPad will do more and has a wonderful, big, bright display, but the cost-to-benefit ratio is not good (MUCH more expensive for somewhat more capability), and it's bigger so more of a pain to carry or pack.  If you need a capability that an iPad has and a Kindle Fire doesn't, go for the iPad, but I suspect that for most people, unless they are blinded by the \"toy value\" and prestige of an iPad, a Kindle will do fine.Barnes & Noble makes comparable Nooks that also should be looked at and are great products as well.  I don't think you'd go wrong with either a Kindle or a comparable Nook.  We chose the Kindle from comparing some subjective factors such as book and magazine databases, cloud storage and memory size, tiny pricing differences, etc.  We've also enjoyed a good relationship with Amazon and found them to stand behind purchases, which by all reports B&N; also does, but the devil you know vs. the devil you don't...In summary, this is a product that is still being developed and I'm sure more apps and better features will be coming, but for the price, the Kindle Fire is an excellent product, both very useful and a lot of fun.

It is not/was not/probably won't ever be designed to be a tablet.  If you want HDMI, SD slot, bluetooth, Marketplace, Apple store, facebook/twitter apps, etc THE KINDLE FIRE IS NOT FOR YOU!!! Fork over $399 plus and buy a tablet or IPad.The Kindle Fire (you DO realize what the name KINDLE is synonymous with right?) is a wonderful, colorful, crisp BOOKREADER with TONS of extras that make it so worth the $199 price tag. If you expect it to do more than read books, surf the net, play games, download Amazon store apps you will be thoroughly disappointed!For someone like me, the Amazon store has a variety of apps, games, books etc (both free and paid)that make it beyond worth while.  I love that I have access to my email, facebook, twitter, access my banking info, listen to music and any and everything else I use my laptop or desktop for.I LOVE the Netflix app and how beautiful the picture is.

I will not purchase anymore of those.***Another gripe I have is that there appears to be a software issue regarding connecting to public wifi that has a splashpage requiring you to \"logon\" to the wireless network such as airports, hotels, government buildings, libraries etc.  Just the fact that a splashpage pops up will cause your device to reboot itself repeatedly until you a. turn off wifi completely, b. tell it to \"forget\" that connection or c. (which has been working for me until they figure out a true solution) immediately load \"yahoo.com\" or \"google.com\" in your browser which will give you the option to logon to the wifi network. It can't be twitter or facebook it has to be a page like google or yahoo.Other than that...

I read multiple reviews on each, WATCHED video reviews on each, and talked to 2 or 3 IT professionals to get their impressions/thoughts.  I went to countless stores to play with each device (repeatedly), and I came away with the following verdict:  there is no 'winner' and each device CLEARLY has distinct advantages.iPad:  I love Apple products.  They're elegant, simple, reliable, and (in their own way) works of art.  I already have a desktop and a laptop, so I wanted something VERY portable (i.e. could fit into my handbag)... granted, if I had a BIG handbag, an iPad would fit, but truly the size makes it a bit cumbersome.  PLUS at $499, it was way more expensive than the other two options.  (Two strikes against the iPad.)Nook Tablet:  I love my local Barnes & Noble.  It's one of the last great 'brick and mortar' bookstores.  There are few things I enjoy more on a rainy Sunday than wandering the stacks at B&N.;  Plus the advantages to the Nook:  there is more 'onboard' storage space than the Kindle.  You can go into any B&N; and read any of their titles for 1 hour per day (free).  Last, there's always a human at the B&N; who can answer your questions and help you.Kindle Fire:  (the eventual winner).  First, amazing price tag:  $199.  Really?  Is that a typo?  No, seriously, it's $199.  It's portable, sturdy, I can hold it in one hand, put it in my handbag, AND it does everything I want it to do.  Does it make phone calls?  Nope, but hey I have a smartphone.  Does it take pictures or videos?  Nope, but hey I have a little point-and-shoot digital that works just fine thank you.  What I CAN do with my Kindle Fire is surf the internet, check Facebook, send emails, watch instant videos (you get 1 month of Amazon Prime free with purchase, and TRUST ME, you will love this...) and READ to my heart's content (and boy do I love to read...)  You can read magazines, newspapers and books.  Oh yes, you can listen to MUSIC too.  And of course, there is the app functioning and gaming stuff you can do if you're so inclined..A couple items of note:  1)  the 'reading' screen:  I've heard mixed reviews on this; however, I love the screen.  You can change the font, point size, brightness of the screen, etc.  You can also read 'portrait-style' or 'landscape-style'.  You can highlight, make notes, and use bookmarks.  It's great.2)  the on/off button.  Apparently there are folks out there who have accidentally hit the off button.  OOPS.  There's an easy fix, Einstein.  Just flip the Kindle 1/4 turn to the right or 1/4 turn to the left and - VOILA - problem solved.  The on/off button is no longer a potential problem.  (Really, this is such a non-issue I'm surprised people are bringing it up.)3)  LAST (and this was the BIG clincher for me)... there are soooo many free and really cheap books at Amazon.  When I compared e-book prices between B&N; and Amazon, there was a BIG difference.  Now, for people who don't read much, this might not be an issue, but if you read a lot, and B&N; prices are $2 - $4 more PER book... that will add up.Bottom line:  each device is different and has pros and cons...  make sure you really investigate, take the time to play with each one, and purchase the best one for you and YOUR needs.Regardless, the technology we have access to now is truly amazing!

The Fire does a great job. The screen is nice and bright and easily adjustable. Want to browse a bit and watch videos? Works nicely. At $199 and 7 inches, it's a terrific device that fits right in the middle of the pack - great value, nice set of functions and features, works well.Kindle (original type) - Want something super light that you can read outdoors, but don't need much else other than a book reader?

Very limited, but if it's books you're replacing, does a decent job.iPads - Want something that is part of the Apple ecosystem and is terrific for browsing the web, reading news, and running a load of Apps?

I am an average housewife looking for a good book and a game every now and then.  I was not wanting a \"tablet\", just an ereader with more capabilites than reading books.  This summer I purchased a Nook Color and I preordered the Kindle Fire.  I wanted to compare them and whichever one I liked best I would keep.  The loser would go to my kids.After using both, I have decided the kids will get the...Nook Color.  But I might add, that I believe the Nook Color was the best choice for my kids also. For the following reasons:I love the Nook Color childrens books.  They are interactive and keep my kids attention (ages 4, 6 and 9).Most importantly, they have parental controls for downloads.  The Fire lacks parental controls, therefore only getting 4 stars.  My 4 yr old has already figured out how to order apps on the fire, to my dismay.  The nook color also has great apps for children, although a lot of them you have to pay for, whereas, you can find many of the apps on the Fire for free.The Fire weighs less than the Nook Color.  I believe the Nook tablet weighs even less than the Fire.  I don't have an e-ink reader, so I had nothing to compare the weight issue to.  I can hold both the Nook and Fire easily and I can hold them for hours reading books on them.  In my opinion, the weight is a non-issue to me.The Fire was the best choice for me over the Nook Color for the following reasons:1.  Smaller in size.  It is nice for me because I don't carry a big purse and it fits nicely in there.2.  Wi-Fi.  It is a tie between the Nook and Fire.  I don't need 3g because my intent was not to be able to browse the internet from anywhere.  I would get a smart phone if I wanted that.  The wi-fi suits me just fine.  Although on the fire, it tends to loose its signal more in my home than the Nook did.3.  Keyboard:  I like the keyboard a little better on the Fire.  It is easier to tap and with auto correction, it makes typing emails a breeze.  If I had to type a long email or document, like this review, I prefer the standard keyboard on my laptop.  But with the need for minimal typing the keyboard on the Fire works great.4.  Apps:  By far the winner is the Fire.  It has great apps and many I have found are cheap.  I am not a professional and need a lot of utility apps.  I just mainly browse the games, both for myself and my children.  I have found that many I had to pay for on the Nook, were free on the Kindle.5.  Streaming:  I tried to stream one video on the Nook.  It didn't go so well...it had lots of hangups and was very choppy.  Although I really don't stream a lot, the Fire does a much better job of that. I have also downloaded a couple tv shows to keep on my kindle in case my kids get restless at the doctors office, store, etc.  That comes in handy quite a bit.6.  Music:  I don't really download music so I don't have any comments on this area.  I do, however, have the pandora app and listen to music that way.  Works about the same on the Nook and Fire.7.  Speakers:  This is one area the fire lags.  Both speakers are located on the bottom and when you are watching a movie, all the sounds come from the left or right side.  But it is not a problem if you use earbuds.8.  Amazon Prime:  I am disappointed with the free shows or movies amazon offers for their Prime members.  My kids wanted to watch Edward Scissorhands, which was made YEARS ago, and I had to pay to rent it.  It was not offered to Prime members, which was disappointing.  But I do love prime for the book lending.  I noticed they had a Chelsea Handler book that I paid $13 for to read on my Nook, and I could have read it for free on the Prime book lending program they have.  The free shipping is also great, but everytime I order something, it takes 3 days to get to my door instead of 2.  I am not upset by that because I would be just as happy with ground shipping, but Prime does offer 2 day shipping and for me it is not 2 day.9.  Memory:  This was a big one for me because the Fire does not have a memory expansion slot.  Before I got my Fire, I looked on my Nook and found out how much memory I had left.  I had a multitude of apps and a lot of books and I used less than 1gb.  I never used the expansion slot for my personal need.  I was still concerned about the Fire with the memory, mainly because of all the reviews out there.  I LOVE the cloud and it suits my needs just fine.  Again, I don't watch a lot of movies or videos on the Fire, so I have plenty of memory for me to use.  I have 1 hour of video, many books and about 50 apps on my Fire and have used less than 1GB.I know there are a lot of consumers out there that are trying to figure out which ereader tablet to buy this holiday season.  Honestly, you can not go wrong with either one.  But in my opinion, I feel the Fire has more features on it than the Nook.4 stars for the Fire.  I will change to 5 if they put on parental controls soon.", "Date": "December 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not an iPad Killer; an Android Pad Killer", "Author": "Karl F.

So, I ordered one, figuring it's another no-brainer.  Priced right, open Android, 4 grandchildren I can give it to for Xmas if I don't like it, etc.  It arrived yesterday, and the first thing I did was load the Kindle app and continued reading \"The Abbey\".  Today, my Kindle Fire arrived, already charged and almost ready to use.OMG, what a different \"getting started\" experience!  Great job, Amazon!  I just need to remove my identity from the Thrive, de-register it, and buy some gift wrap for it.  The display is brighter and the screens seem more friendly.  It is so much easier holding a 7\" device than a 10\".  My duplicate investment has truly paid off.  I now know what my future will be: a new desktop computer to replace my old laptop.  Keep the laptop for long trips where I want to do some serious report-writing, and always take my Fire for media consumption.  For a person like me, Amazon hit the nail on the head.  I am now aware that I don't want a tablet as a computer, just as a tablet.FOLLOW-UP CAUTION:  Perhaps this is a non-issue for others.  When shopping, it is easy to buy stuff by accident.  The touchscreen can be so sensitive that you select a book or subscription or catalog item, and one-click (if active) pays instantly.  My advice is to turn off one-click under \"My Account\".

Thumasathit", "ReviewID": "R1VNU4CKPSW0PX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There is nothing I can do with my Kindle Fire (or an iPad) that I can't do on another device I already own.For watching / streaming movies and TV shows, I have a big-ass TV that is connected to the internet. I subscribe to Hulu Plus, Netflix, and Amazon Prime.For listening to music, I have big-ass speakers, and they are hooked up to my receiver.  My receiver, in turn, has an iPhone/iPod jack.  I also have a gift subscription to Pandora One which my wired DVD player can access.For real work / productivity / typing fast with all 10 fingers, I use my work-issued laptop.  I also use the same laptop for video conferencing and web surfing. If I want to surf big, I connect my laptop to my 32 inch monitor.For telephone calls, I use my iPhone 3GS, and it still works like a charm.For photos, I use my iPhone 3GS in a pinch.  When I know I want to take a boatload of good photos, e.g., while I'm on vacation with the boys, I use my Panasonic Lumix F27.For playing Angry Birds and Planets vs. Zombies (I don't play -- my kids do -- really), they commandeer my iPhone.For a GPS, I use my iPhone. For turn-by-turn directions in a robotic voice, I use a very cheap Magellan GPS unit that works just fine.For reading books, I actually use the Kindle for PC application on my laptop or the Kindle application on my iPhone.For all these reasons above, I absolutely LOVE my Kindle Fire.For me, a tablet is all about *convenient entertainment*. Yes, I can already do anything and everything a tablet does with a different device -- but with a tablet, I can do it more conveniently.  I can read a book more conveniently; I can surf the web in bed more conveniently; I can watch several movies on an airplane more conveniently.At the end of the day, it's an adult toy. And, as far as toys are concerned, I'm downright opposed to spending $500 (or more) on a toy that can easily break and that will be quickly obsolete, etc.To the iPad Fan Boys / Nook Lovers out there, I say take a chill pill. You too should love the Kindle Fire.  Sure, it's speeds and feeds may not be totally awesome and it's missing this hardware and that and some of the software seems to be buggy.  But who cares?  Let us keep in mind the big picture:- This is a 1.0 product.  It can only get better from here.  The software is already improving as I write, and the hardware will certainly improve as well.- This will put tremendous downward pricing pressure on the rest of the market.  Because of the Kindle Fire, iPad Fan Boys will eventually be able to buy new iPads for 50-60% of its current price.So I say, rock on, Kindle Fire.  Amazon has taken a big, bold step in the tablet market, and the winner isn't Amazon or Apple or Barnes & Noble -- it's the consumer.P.S.  To everyone that accidentally hits the power button -- you can rotate the Kindle Fire upside-down.", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "My Favorite Thing", "Author": "MARK J LEFLER", "ReviewID": "R2M2W2MXWNZKRL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After a full day of use, the Kindle Fire is my new favorite thing.Huge benefits:Very easy to use and fast software.  By \"fast\" I mean you can more quickly get to your stuff than in a standard tablet (like a normal Android or iPad).  Amazon has rethought the tablet and engineered it around the content.  One touch and you are watching a movie, reading a book or listening to a favorite song. Most PCs and tablets require you to open something (file browser, video player, music player) then select what you want to play or see.  Fire keeps content at the top son one tap and you are using it.  An the things you last used (web pages, music, book, video...) are all in a stack with the most recently used at the top of the stack.  Huge time saver.Weight: It is light.  After using an iPad for a while (22 ounces) I frankly grew tired of holding it.  It is not a practical device to hold for long periods (but is fine propped up on a table).  The fire weighs 14 ounces, about half the weight.  Less than many books, and much less of a strain to hold.  I bought a very thin case that lets me prop up my Fire when I want hands free operation.Size: It slips easily into a baggy pants pocket or carrying bag, so you are much more likely to have it with you than a heavier netbook, laptop or tablet.Cost: $199 is killer.  So cheap, if I lost one, I would not hate it too much, since I know I can get a replacement quickly and still have all my stuff. If I lost an expensive laptop or iPad, the cost is cash and worry is a lot more.Browser: The silk browser just works.  On most web sites it is very fast, much faster than the original nook color.  Flash content works great so you do not have empty spaces in many popular web pages like on the iPad (hopefully HTML 5 will eventually solve this).  And as Silk learns the browsing habits of the masses, it should get faster and faster over time.  Someone should record web page load times every day for the next month to see how this goes.  I would love to see the browser even more like Chrome, with more screen real estate for the content, but what the Fire already has works great.  Note at the present, the \"Accelerate\" option does not seem to speed up most web pages, so I generally leave it turned off.After your initial boot up and software update, the device switches on instantly.  One power button press and a slide on the screen and you are at your content.What they forgot to mention in other reviews:I find you can easily install non-Amazon App Store items. Just touch the settings * icon in the top right of the screen, \"More\", and set \"Allow Installation of Applications\" to \"ON\".  Go to getjar.com to get the APK files for your favorite Apps.  Many work just fine.No GPS: true, but the Fire has Location Services installed which uses WiFi signals to find location, assuming there are WiFi signals in your town.  So download the free Mapquest application for the Amazon App store, and tap the upper left Green symbol, and it will show you where you are, were nearby coffee shops and stuff are, and how to get to where you want to go.  You do need a WiFi signal to get the maps and directions.Amazon Prime gives you lots of content (monthly free book, TV and Movies).  Amazon Video is just so much better than the crude system they started with years ago.  Videos start fast and I had no issues with jerky videos of the past.  The videos remain synced across devices, so you can start a movie on the Fire and continue it on your televisions Roku. Using Netflix and Hulu Plus is easy and greatly expands your choices of video.Music: just awesome. Amazon lets you download all your DRM free music, even from your computer's iTunes library, to the Amazon cloud.  A quick tap on \"Music\" then \"Cloud\" and there your songs are. You can download albums and songs to the Fire, or play them directly via the cloud.  If you will be out of a WiFi zone, make sure to copy songs you want to listen to to the fire.  Playlists are easy to create.Bad things:Glare from the screen is appreciable.  Since glare is all based on reflections, you can often control this by tilting the screen so it is reflecting a dark background.  For example, a favorite coffee shop has a black ceiling, which makes it easy to eliminate the glare by holding the tablet so that it reflects the dark ceiling.  Or if you are wearing dark clothes you can do the same thing anywhere.  I will experiment with glare reducing screen savers.  The glare is no worse than what you would find from a glossy laptop screen.  I wish more makers would use matte screens which spread out reflections and reduce glare.Future Desires:An html output would be niceSupport for bluetooth would also let me use Skype and other internet chat services (the chip in the kindle supports this but they would have to add software support for this)Overall: I love it.Edit:I left off customer service.  I just got this email from Amazon:\"We wanted to let you know that the price on the Marware MicroShell Folio Cover for Kindle Fire has dropped. You previously paid $39.99, and the price has been reduced to $29.99. As a result of this price change we have added a $10.00 promotional certificate to your account, which will be automatically applied to your next purchase on Amazon.com. You can use this balance the next time you order an item shipped and sold by Amazon.com.\"Name another company that gives you back money when a price drops!

I, like many other Amazon fans, was concerned that others were receiving their Kindle Fire before me. I called to question the way this was handled. Today, just one day later I received my Kindle. I didn't have to go to the stores, look for parking or wait on lines. The Kindle simply arrived.This is an amazing piece of equipment. It is not an iPad but it packs so much into a smaller size and with a much smaller price tag. The box comes with the Kindle Fire and a charger. If you are a current Kindle owner, as I am, and purchased the Fire on your Amazon account, your Fire will load itself automatically when you plug it in and turn it on. Then the fun begins. It is pretty intuitive to use with just the few lines of instruction that are included in the box and the tutorial that appears when you turn it on--using the small button on the bottom. It is loaded with your books and many of the apps that you will want like Amazon, Facebook, Youtube, Words with Friends. I roamed Facebook and watched two YouTube videos--Nassau State of Mind and How to be a DJ. Both were great! Many others Apps are available at no cost or for a very small charge--usually $0.99. I downloaded Netflicks, Angry birds and Solitaire in just a few minutes. I quickly played (and won!) my first game of solitaire!Then I went to check my mail. I signed on to AOL which now remains as an icon on my screen. The pages opened quickly and easily. The size of the screen makes it easy to read and send mail.And finally I read my current book. It was easy to download from the archives which appeared on my screen. The book loaded and found my place from my other kindle. I lowered the brightness of the screen to make reading very comfortable. This didn't really affect the other screens when I returned to my email, etc.So far I'm loving this device.

The app store, movies,books and comics, internet, and even the physical construction of the device has impressed me. The only negatives I have would be the volume control, app design, and the speed to a certain degree. I wouldn't even call them negatives, just set backs that I feel could definitely be improved on.I miss having physical volume controls because with certain games like angry birds, I haven't figured out how to change the volume in game. It's not big, but I will add physical volume buttons to my wish list for the next revision of the Kindle Fire.The next would be app design. The way apps like pulse news reader are set up, I feel they can be improved. The only complaint I have with Pulse new reader is where the back button is positioned. When you hold the device in landscape mode, you have to physically move your hand over to touch the back button to get back to your Pulse home screen. It's small, but I feel this can be fixed in a software update.  I\"ve only experience this with Pulse, so i'm not sure if any other apps have changed.The last would be the speed. Sometimes if you are on an internet site that has a lot of flash content, the Kindle Fire will slow down. It's nothing major, but it is noticeable. Sites that don't use flash though have been perfect. Zooming in and out and scrolling were seamless, just flash heavy sites didn't fare so well, which is to be expected on a mobile device. Speed in the rest of the device was surprisingly quick, all my normal sites I visit have loaded up within seconds! There were a few slow down's here and there, but overall, the Kindle Fire has been a lot of fun to use. I can't put it down!!The majority of these \"complaints\" I have with the fire are based around the software. These little things can easily be fixed over time, and I have a feeling they will. After only a few hours with the Kindle Fire, I believe Amazon has got a winner on their hands. Without touching on everything about the Kindle Fire in this review, this device has gone beyond what I expected it to be.

At first, I was hesitant toward getting one because of all the negativity surrounding it in most reviews. However, I decided to give it a shot. So far, I've discovered that most of the nitpicky complaints (and most of them are just that) are unfounded and probably rushed. So I've decided to comment on several and even point some things out to anyone who may still be confused or leaning toward the other tablets because of some of the negative reviews.1. From my experience, the power button is not obtrusive, as some have said it is. My guess is that they accidentally hit it once or twice and overreacted. You could just flip your Fire around so it's on the top (for some things).2. The touch screen works fine. Sometimes you have to hit the back arrow a few times, but what device doesn't have minor faults? I've experienced issues like that on desktops before!3. Streaming content with Amazon Prime, Hulu or Netflix works fine with a good signal. Unfortunately, some people seem to be ignoring or are unaware of how a wireless signal will be divided up if more than one person is using it at the same time. So if you're at a hotspot with 20 others or streaming a movie in your household while your kids are on Youtube/streaming movies and the video is choppy/audio is out of sync... that's probably why.4. The Silk browser isn't quite as fast as they made it sound before the release date, but it's certainly not as slow as many reviews claim. Not once have I become impatient waiting for anything to load.5. The lack of an external volume slider has not bothered me at all. However, most negative reviews twist this issue too. As of this date, all you have to do to change the volume on all 3 streaming services is:a.) Amazon Prime; Tap the video while it's playing and a volume slider will pop up near the upper right corner.b.) Netflix; Tap the white line at the bottom center, then tap the top right corner for the quick settings menu. The volume slider will pop up.c.) Hulu; Tap the video while it's playing and a volume slider will pop up near the upper left corner.6. The carousel moves too quick? Not for me. Maybe YOU'RE moving too quick.7. \"The carousel stores my history.\" Rumor has it that that is going to change with the next update sometime before 2012.8. \"Amazon's appstore doesn't have as many apps as....\" Seriously, people? The Fire is a month old!There are more things to comment about, but I'm going to stop here. I hope I've made a point for anyone that was just as confused as I was before actually buying a Fire and adapting myself to it.", "Date": "December 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Everything I'd Hoped For...And I knew it wasn't an iPad", "Author": "Matt", "ReviewID": "R1D4ZR15KUE6FD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm an Apple guy.  I wouldn't trade my iPhone for anything Android, nor would I trade my MacBook for anything PC.  So when Amazon debuted the Kindle Fire, I was skeptical.  Would it really deliver?  I waited until well after the Fire began shipping before making the decision to part with $200 (maybe a pittance to some, but not to me!).  I read reviews for days, and I kept going back and forth on \"should I hold out for an iPad?\"  In the end, I decided that the Fire was the tool for me and that I'd keep the extra $300 to buy diapers and baby food with.In all the reviews I've read, I think that the common denominator on the poor reviews is that everyone expected an iPad-like product for a cell phone like price.  I know full well that the iPad has more functionality, more apps, more screen size, etc.  However, like many of the reviews I've read, if you don't need all that, then the Kindle Fire will blow you away.  It certainly did me.As an e-reader, it's already replaced my Kindle keyboard, due to the simple fact that I can read late at night or early in the morning without turning on a light and waking up my wife.  And no crazy priced lighted case to have to worry about, either.  Books display well, and the features imbedded in the Kindle work great.  I certainly like typing notes much better than with the Kindle keyboard. No problems with weight or anything.  I hold it just like my old Kindle.  I really like the ability to see the books in the Carousel and the home screen.  Much easier to find than on the Kindle 3.  Yeah, having the ability to organize the books would be nice, but it's not that big a deal.  You can always click on the \"book\" tab and go to the author view if you don't like looking at all your books as once.Second, playing games (which my kids LOVE) is a blast on the larger screen, a huge step up from my phone.  No, it's not the iPad screen, but for $200, it works really well.  And who cares about all the apps not displaying in every screen orientation?  Have we really become so lazy that we can't flip it around?  And a free app a day is pretty cool, too.Third, my experience with Silk and email has been good.  I'm not going to sit and compose major emails, or browse through a ton of web pages on this thing.  That's why I have a laptop.  But if I want to check something, or respond to a quick email, the Fire works great.Fourth, the touch screen works fine for me.  Yeah, every once in a while it doesn't respond as quick and I have to tap again, but you know what?  My iPhone is the same way.  And yeah, every so often I fly past something in the carousel.  You know what I do?  I SLOW DOWN HOW I SCROLL.  Not that difficult, really.  As to the touchscreen keyboard, I've had no problems with it.  Maybe it's because I'm used to typing on my iPhone, but I wonder what people were expecting.  Touch screens on every device I've ever used are kind of hooky, including the iPhone.  And you know what?  Operator error enters in more than device error.Fifth, the Cloud storage is great.  I've loaded quite a bit of music up, and the Fire streams it seamlessly.  Volume is good for a small device.  Haven't tried headphones yet, but will do that soon, I'm sure.  Video from Prime is seamless, too.  The combination of Cloud storage, free shipping, and free content will probably entice me to become a Prime member when the trial runs out.  Tough to beat for under $7 a month.In the end, the Fire does everything I hoped it would do and it does it well.  I was struck when reading many of the reviews by much of the criticism that we are truly a spoiled people nowadays.  The Fire is not going to change my life, or complete me.  It's a fun gadget that allows me to do fun things in an easy and convenient way.  It's for ENTERTAINMENT, and  it does it extremely well.The only thing I would seriously like to see change is the one-click option.  C'mon Amazon!  We WANT to put our passwords in to purchase!

The setting button can be found beside the battery icon, just tap it and options will open up.  If you don't see the battery or settings icon, you need to tap the bottom of the screen to get the arrow to appear.  Then they will appear too.  This is what you would have to do if you're playing a game or watching a video.LOCKING OR PASSWORD PROTECTING DEVICE-You most certainly canIn the settings you CAN go into the security features and turn on the lock password.  Once you turn it on it lets you type in the password of your choice.  So there is no worry of having someone getting your Kindle Fire and going through your stuff.THE POWER BUTTONI've seen complaints about the location of the power button, which is always the lock button.  Just like the iPod touch, you tap the button to lock, or hold it in to power on and power off.  When you are powering off, it just doesn't turn off like some people have said.  The device asks you if you would like to shut down.  Just simply hit cancel if you don't want to shut it down.  The power button is not a problem at all.  Its so small I don't know how people hit it by accident, but big deal if you do hit it.  Just hit cancel when it asks you if you want to shut it down.THE TOUCH SENSITIVITYI think the touch is just as good as apples products.  In using my friends Kindle Fire I noticed it was exactly like my iPod Touch.  I've read some comments that you have to have skinny fingers to use the device and that you're doomed if you have fat fingers.  I have very fat fingers and it worked great for me.  With the pinch-to-zoom technoloy, I made sure the webpage was totally zoomed out to make the text as small as possible.  It never once opened something inaccurately.  Everything I touched, it was right on the dot.  So don't let people scare you about having fat fingers.  I was very impressed with it.LOADING SPEEDWhen opening up videos on webpages, on Amazon Prime video on demand, and on sites like youtube, the buffering rate was very impressive.  The speed of the videos were super fast.  The speed of loading websites was very fast too.  There is nothing slow about this device.One big hint I'm throwing out there that I think all the people that had bad reviews for this product should know, is that there is a little settings icon up in the top right hand corner of the screen beside the battery icon.  If you tap it, every option you can think of to customize your Kindle Fire is there at your finger tips.  From Amazon user accounts to add with passwords, to security features, to volume, to web options and history.  Everything everyone said this product wouldn't do, couldn't do, is there.The Kindle Fire is a great product.  I'll definitely be a satisfied customer when I get mine for Christmas.  Anyone who wants one or is thinking about it, I think you should try it out.  It truly is a fun little device.  From the newsstand, to books, movies, tv shows, music, games, and all the apps, it truly has everything.  Except for a camera.  But I'm not worried about a camera on it, I have a digital camera.

In fact, the morning after I purchased one online, The New York Times ran an article basically remarking on  how lame a product the Kindle Fire is compared to the Nook Color tablet. That was when I decided that the only way to really understand what was good or bad about the Kindle Fire was to wait until it arrived and make my own mind up about it. According to what I had read in these reviews, I feared that it might not recognize my at home wifi network... I feared that it would be slow and hard to use. It arrived and I unpacked it, turned on and unlocked it... and it already knew the name of my wifi network! All I had to do was punch in the passcode and voil\u00e0!

In that time I have watched TV shows and movies, checked my Facebook, Twitter, and email, read books, played games, listened to music, and surfed the web.

It was intuitive and easy to use, the picture is absolutely beautiful, and it seems quick and responsive.I am giving it five stars because it performs exactly as it was advertised. Some people have given the Fire poor reviews because of what it lacks, but since it clearly advertised what it came equipped with, this is just silly. The Fire is an amazing little device for the price. It never claimed to be an iPad, or to come with a camera or expandable SD slot. So to give it low reviews for NOT having/being those things is ridiculous.My only complaint is the carousel. It spins to fast, is hard to use, and displays the entire contents of the archive and the recent history. I am still giving this device five stars because I am certain that Amazon, who excels in their customer service, will soon release an update to allow customization or disabling of the carousel.

The only thing that I see a downfall is that their is no usb cord for transferring files, but you are warned ahead of time that their is none... It is just like an ipod touch/ipad... It actually for me runs faster than my iPod touch... I like this  better than the nook... The tabs are a little tricky to get used to, but eventually you get used to it...I am editing my review for many reasons...Kindle has officially won me over :) ...I have had experience with kobo, ipod touch/ipods, kindle, and nook color/regular nook... Of all the ereaders I believe this one is the best... It can do everything your iPod touch can do + more and it is faster... seriously... i don't know if it's just with the age of my ipod touch or what, but I find it faster on loading web and everything...Between kobo, ipod, nook color, and kindle fire email featureskobo their is nonekindle and ipod touch/ipad are somewhat tied... They can both load almost every email, however... I am having tech issues getting my college email set up on the kindle fire... I did however, have issues getting it set up on the ipod touch, so it may just be me typing something wrong... Nook color/tablet email only lets you use gmail and hotmail... no one else...Documents... The only document I believe that nook color/tablet supports and kindle fire doesn't is epub... I could be wrong on that, but I don't use many of the others... However, that issue doesn't bother me because epub can be converted through calibre... The kindle fire however, can support comics and you can read comics while on the nook color/tablet you can't...Kindle Fire applications are larger than the nook color/tablet applications as well... basically you are looking at the ipod store applications when you buy kindle fire... nook color does not have many applications... I actually look to seeing farmville being on the amazon store in the future... they already have that word game from zynga, so farmvilles probably next :)Price wise the kindle fire is the cheapest tablet... well next to the kobo... I think kindle fire and kobo are the same price, i haven't checked on it, but the ipad, and nook color are more expensive...Kindle fire uses the previous kindle cables if you need to transfer files, it is strong and reliable... what I have been complaining about to other people about the nook color/tablet cord is that it falls apart were it gets plugged into the device... I realize that it hasn't happened to all people, but for a majority of us it has happened to... If you look at the B&N; website search and find their cord... you will see what I mean it has a 2 star review I think... The adapter for the kindle fire is like the original kindle cable/similar to it... It looks strong enough, but I guess we'll see as the time comes... I didn't have problems with the nook color cable until about a month or 2 after I purchased it...Kindle Fire will allow you to transfer microsoft office/word documents, which I now see as a plus... I didn't expect that feature... it will be handy for my homework assignments since I am an online student... I don't think nook color has that feature, but I may be wrong... I have not really used the nook color a lot since the cord kept breaking... I got P/o'd with it...The Nook color does have the sd card slot for adding additional memory, but kindle fire has cloud memory that makes up for it... you can basically buy unlimited memory in cloud... i don't have the prices, but it was showing me when I registered my kindle fire to cloud... then you can upload your own files into cloud, so really their is no need for a sd card slot...Kobo, is a good device, but I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone... They have a neat feature with the reader awards... basically you can get awards for reading at certain times/books... You can't really buy many accessories for it or do much with the kobo now though, since borders went bankrupt, so I don't see a point in buying one...The sound is also much much louder on the kindle fire than the nook color...That's pretty much all I can think of... The kobo kind of went out since borders went out of business, so their kind of competition, but their not... you can buy different colors which I see that as a plus because I was drawn to their pink kobo, but you can more or less buy accessories and make your kindle fire/nook color pink... Then the kobo software is very tricky... like after how many uses it ask you to format their device and you basically loose everything... :( You don't get that with nook color or kindle...I am still with my previous post in the forum though... I am pretty much boycotting nook color/tablet until they fix the cable... I just don't see what the point of buying a device that in the future you won't be able to charge it because your cable will break and their will be no warranty to replace the cable... When I look to buy a device I expect nearly 100% of the device and all it's functions/what's included with it... I have not had any problems with kindle fire cable, but I have not owned it long enough to experience any problems... however, if i do, i will edit my review... Their is the plus side though that the original kindle cables are compatible with the kindle fire, so if you have a previous cable from another kindle, you can use it with your kindle fire. :) nook color/tablet doesn't offer that otherwise I'd switch to the nook simple touch cable... it's a lot stronger...Ok I have found a couple flaws to the kindle fire...1... no more sound buttons... you can only change the volume through the settings... I see this as a downfall, but i also see this as a plus... sometimes unless I have the hold button turned on my ipod, I accidentally change the sound, so that can be a plus in that way2... the kindle fire doesn't keep a charged when plugged in usb mode... it is like the nook color and the only way you can charge it is through the adapter not when you plug it into the computer... i assume that is why their is no usb code...3... itunes purchases aren't supported... well i'm not sure about music, but I tried an itunes mp4 file, and it wasn't supported, however i never expected it to be.and the kindle fire still continues impresses me... I just found a feature in the settings, but you can change your notification sounds... theirs like 7 or so to choose from... I set mine to pixie dust :)And hopefully this is the last time I have to edit, but I just found something amazing again :) If you are on the home menu, and you click and hold on the book/document you can delete it... even if it is a personal document that you transferred onto it... No other device can do that, that I know of... All the others you have to plug in to deleteKindle fire seems to work with every email, except I am still struggling to set up my kent email to it... It was hard getting it set up to my ipod though... I don't know what's causing the issues, but next time I go up to campus, I'll see what I'm doing wrong... The nook color/tablet only let you use certain emails such as gmail and hotmail, but yahoo it doesn't work with or like aol... unlike the kindle fire... almost every email works with the kindle fire, it has the same set up as the ipod touch/ipadAnd found more positive things about the kindle fire... For the microsoft office documents, go to the word application... not sure if that's what it's called... anyways click into that... don't enter those programs inside it though... click browse and you can load all your personal documents including files under microsoft office... This is what I am excited about because all my homework is due using microsoft office, so I can edit on the go...Then if you are a prime member, you can stream certain movies for free... they only have certain movies right now though... I think it's 10 movies total...My only complaint about the movies is that you can't view/stream your flixster movies... i think it's because of the way the app is designed...update June 28, 2012The carousel is annoying... it took me a while day to remove all my books from it, so that the only ones that show are the books I am reading... I was trying to scroll to find a book quick at school, and I was embarrassed because my friend was watching me over my shoulder, and he saw a lot of books on it I wish he hadn't seen... I have the books I read more often on the favorites, but I wish they made a clear all button on the carousel... or either that they should remove it all together.Their also seems to be a glitch with the facebook share feature... sometimes when I finish a book at 100%, it will let me post, but I have to keep prompting it... Like right now I am reading the Hunger games on it, and if you scroll to 100%, it won't let you post... not sure what's up, but that feature needs to be fixed...

The first group of one-star reviewers seem to be the frustrated parents complaining about the \"lack of privacy\", or \"kids being able to one-touch purchase\". Simple solutions for both. First, if you're worried about your spouse or child seeing what you've been perusing, I'm pretty sure your skeletons in the closet are more of an issue than the device itself. Secondly, be a parent and teach your kids discipline and integrity. If they can't be responsible enough to handle such freedom, go buy them a LeapFrog or some Matchbox cars.

Tuszynski", "ReviewID": "R128W1VMUT9PDN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "i went in knowing it wasn't going to come close to an iPad.  Amazon sold me on their \"cloud\" concept, or rather what I thought the cloud was. Waited 2 months to get my Fire, and I was extremely disappointed in less than 30 minutes.  In reading what material there was on the Fire, I preloaded my \"cloud\" with some music, pictures, and videos so that I could use the Fire as soon as it arrived.  What Amazon did not mention was that my personal uploaded video, docs, and pics were NOT going to be able to be streamed to my Kindle Fire.  Only your MP3 music files and Amazon purchased content will work.  You can however, purchase a separate cable and transfer video, docs, and pics directly to the device and view them using the \"gallery\" app.  Having only 6gigs of usable space, this process totally defeats the whole purpose of having a \"cloud\" in the first place.  I am returning the device because this cloud problem was the definite deal breaker for me, as i planned on purchasing even more cloud space in order to stream any of my content whenever I wanted without worrying about sd cards, or syncing my device to my pc.  In addition, it got very annoying, very quickly having to tap my selections more than once to get them going.  I agree with others in regard to the placement of the power button, that should have been caught way back in the beta stage somewhere.  These things are very fixable, whether Amazon cares to will remain to be seen.  I personally don't think they were looking to break into the tablet market, just create a device with which to sell there media content to. Kind of like the old \"11 cd's for a penny\" clubs, just purchase a few at regular club prices.

It seems to me that most people who gripe about the Fire are generally upset because they did not get iPad functionality out of this device which was never created to be an iPad killer or replacement.  The Kindle Fire is a great android device with some apps that are nice and some functions that work very well.  While I am every satisfied with my Fire, I do have a few gripes which I will start with and then move on to address complaints I've heard others make and talk about what I feel are the highlights.  So, first the gripes.The things that I have found that I don't really like are:1) The screen does not darken enough.  I have not been in a situation where I couldn't read my Fire during the day, no matter how bright it was where I was at.  I have, however, found that I often wish that I could darken it much more, especially while I am reading in bed.  Even at its darkest setting, it still illuminates my room more than a night light.  I have my reader set to white letters and black background (which helps a little bit) but it still illuminates the room to the point that it often keeps my wife up and I have to read under the covers.  While this may make me nostalgic for my youth (reading under the blankets with a flashlight as a child) I find it more irritates me as an adult.  I hope that this is something that they can resolve with a software update, I'm not sure how things like that work.  This said, I have several devices (iPad, Nook Tablet, computer, iPod Touch) and none of those seem to get dark enough either.2) I don't like the lack of password protection on the device.  If someone were to get their hands on my Kindle Fire (I'm very careful where I leave it), they would have full access to my account.  This is not a deal breaker for me and I always keep my Fire with me when I'm not at home, however, I could understand why this would be off putting and would like a little additional security in the event it got stolen.3) A small gripe is that the power button is on the bottom of the device.  While this is somewhat irritating, I have leaned to adjust for it and now have hardly any problems hitting it.  Design-wise this is probably the only flaw in the system, I'm not sure why they didn't place it on the top.  With time though, you'll get past this small annoyance, plus, you can always turn the device and make the bottom the top easily enough.  I haven't experienced anything that doesn't adjust to this shift.That's really my only complaints, now on to addressing other complaints I have heard many times over:1)  People that say their apps don't function fully or as well as on other android devices (such as their tablets and phones).  My response to that is, this is not meant to be a tablet.  It is an full color e-reader and it functions awesome as such.  The apps are secondary to it's primary function as an e-reader.  This was not intended to be a major game playing or business software device and so it doesn't necessarily offer full functionality on these.  It does, however, play Angry Birds and Facebook very nicely and most of the \"frivolous\" apps like that work wonderfully on the Fire.  On the plus side, one app that I found works great on this is the \"Splashtop\" remote desktop works awesome.  I added that on my fire (also have it on my iPad) and it works great.  I use it in my classroom so I can work the computer attached to my SMARTboard and it has all the functionality on my Fire that it has on my iPad.2)  You cannot download Amazon Prime movies for viewing offline.  Amazon Prime is not meant to be a downloadable movie program, it's like Netflix, it's meant for streaming.  Netflix members cannot download movies to their devices for offline viewing either.  When you buy Amazon Prime you are buying a streaming service and it works awesome as that.  I am a Amazon Prime member and love what it has to offer.  It has all of the Star Trek series available (I'm a huge Star Trek fan) and, for my son, it has a ton of Sesame Street seasons (he's a huge Elmo fan).  The streaming works great, I've never had a problem watching a streaming movie on my Fire.  If you choose to buy a movie, they download quickly and look wonderful.  Also, the renting service works great as well!3)  I cannot access my own movies that I put on the Amazon Cloud.  I can understand a bit why this would frustrate people, however, movies are secondary to the ereader functionality of the Fire.  If you want a device you can put your own movies on and watch them, then get a tablet.  That is one of the highlights of a tablet, not of the Fire.Finally, why I like the Fire.  I like the Fire because it has great ereader capability, the magazines that I subscribe to are wonderful and priced really well, the Amazon library is amazing in how much content is offered, and Amazon Prime is a wonderful, easy to use service.  I have around 100 books on my Kindle and they all work great.  I love the features to customize my reading experience, it provides everything I really want in a ereader.  I am working towards my Masters right now and Amazon has offered every textbook I have needed on Kindle format with one exception.  This is amazing!  I have saved more money by buying Kindle texts and the Fire in six months than I would have spent buying the used textbooks.  This alone makes it worth the value to any students.  In the classroom, I have found that if I let my 9th graders read off of my Kindle, they are more responsive to reading than they are reading from a traditional book.  I am looking into getting a technology grant for my school so that we can purchase a mobile Kindle lab for use in my classroom.  The prices on the Kindle are phenomenal, the magazines are well prices as are the books, music and movies (well on par with other services and sometimes even better) and renting movies from Amazon is a snap.  I have nothing but praise for these services as they are so easy to use and download quickly.  I love the size of the Kindle, it's very portable and, even with a case on it, it easily fits into my briefcase without taking up much room.  Although I have heard others complain about the touch aspects of the Kindle, I have never had a problem with its accuracy or with its sensitivity.My recommendations for people buying a Kindle Fire:  If you are looking for an ereader with additional functions, if you want to read magazines on your ereader, if you want to watch the occasional movie and play a game here and there, then the Fire is right for you.  If you want something to watch a lot of movies on, if you want to listen to lots of music, if you want to play lots of games or have something that you can do all of your business functions on, if you want to do a lot of web surfing, if you want something to take notes on, etc... then you should look into getting a tablet (either a Galaxy or an iPad).  If you do decide on the Kindle Fire, I would recommend getting a case for it and a ZAGG shield (they may be a bit pricy, but they are the BEST on the market and are worth every penny you pay for them).  I hope this was useful to you and you enjoy your Kindle Fire as much as I have.", "Date": "December 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Im loving it...especially since I have spotify on it now :)", "Author": "Jason Rubo \"Jay\"", "ReviewID": "R23ISKKXIE9C33", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I first got the Kindle Fire, I automatically fell in love with how smooth and clean everything looked.  The size at first seemed a little small (came from a broken 10 in tablet), but now I find it much easier to use than my other tablet.  The screen is very nice and watching movies on it is a blast.  The first thing I noticed that it lacked was spotify and this annoyed me a bit.  I use spotify so much on my cell phone and even though Amazon has their cloud, I do not really buy much music anymore and depend on spotify.  Well, I decided to do some research and found a way to get spotify, along with many other apps off of the android market, without rooting or jailbreaking.  See Directions below:With another Android device (I used my HTC Evo), download App Manager by JRummy.  When you open it, it will show all of your downloaded and stock apps.  If you click and hold on the app, you then click backup when it comes up.  This saves a apk of the app in an app manager folder on your sd card.  From there, I just emailed the apk to myself.  On my Kindle I have File Expert installed and opened that after saving the apk to the fire and opened the apk and installed.  This has worked with Spotify, Yahoo Fantasy Football and Baseball, Chase, MyGreatLakes (student loan company) and even the Google Youtube App.  The only one that would not install for some reason was the best buy app which I am ok with.I was going to originally give this four stars since it was missing those apps, but now that I am able to get them on there (which took ten minutes literally for all of them), there is no reason to give this anything but a five.

Power", "ReviewID": "R2BCZZKTBJNEF7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am happy with the Kindle Fire, since it is at the $199 price point and I don't have a lot of need for any specific tablet functionality beyond what the Kindle Fire is good at: some games, video consumption, color reading, and some apps.  For most tasks I use either my regular Kindle Keyboard, a laptop, or a desktop computer.That said, here are a few improvements that Amazon should make for v2 of the Fire and for the forthcoming 10\" model.  I try to be reasonable considering the price-point of this device as well as the current negative margins:1.  Physical volume control.  I think that physical volume buttons should be added to the device.  In some applications getting to the volume control is difficult and in general hard keys for volume up and down would be nice.2.  Move or protect the power button.  I constantly hit the power button in its current location.  Either move it, or make it something that is harder to hit by accident.3.  Micro-HDMI output.  Since Tivo can't play Amazon Prime videos, it sure would be nice if I could use the Kindle Fire to put that content onto my big screen.  If you fix the Tivo arrangement, then I won't care as much about this one, although it would still be nice.4.  Consider a hard home button.  I can go either way on this one, but a lot of your customers are adamant about the benefits of a hard home button.  Occasionally, I can see the need, but not enough to beg for it.5.  Improve motion sensing (if cost-feasible).  I don't know if there is a gyroscope or an accelerometer in there now, but the ability to control games with motion would be great.6.  Add Bluetooth support.  I don't know how much Bluetooth costs or how much battery life it eats up, but supporting my Bluetooth headphones would be a big plus.7.  Figure out a way to partition access to the Fire, and provide a content control mode.  I am very leery about handing my Kindle to my child or to guests in my house knowing that it is fully linked to my Amazon.com account and my browsing history.  A guest mode, child mode, or a way to partition the device for multiple users would be a very useful enhancement.Overall, I am happy with the Kindle Fire.  It basically is what I expected.  Here are the things that I'm most happy about with it:1.  $199 price point is outstanding.2.  Processor speed is killer.  You never have to wait for anything.3.  The screen is vivid and beautiful.4.  I don't miss not having 3G at all.  If I wanted to pay a monthly fee, I wouldn't be buying a $199 tablet.  I have a Wifi Hotspot that provides data for my computer, my wife's computer, my Kindle, my Kindle Fire, and anything else I need to connect, all for one low price.  Putting 3G in the Kindle Fire would have been a huge mistake for cost, space, and battery life reasons.5.  I am also fine without a camera.  I have so many cameras that I don't know what to do with them all.  I am actually glad that Amazon saved the money and space on not putting a Camera in the Fire.Things that could be improved:1.  8GB of storage is less than ideal.  I already have it filled up and constantly have to decide what to leave in the cloud.2.  Touchscreen is not terrible, but there is definitely an issue, particularly on the home screen.3.  An SD card slot might be nice.4.  Better Application availability.  I'm particularly upset about the Wall Street Journal Tablet Edition software not being available through the Amazon Appstore, but I'm sure there are others.  In the case of the WSJ, I think they exclude it to cause me to buy the \"Kindle Version\" of the WSJ instead of subscribing directly, but all that does is make me mad at Amazon and read the paper on my phone and computer instead of their device.Again, I overall recommend this device.  I just have a few small issues.", "Date": "November 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "A wonderful compromise for the traveling reader", "Author": "J. B Kraft \"lonestargazer\"", "ReviewID": "R37ZLWX2HE8DUG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "FIRST THOUGHTS:I already owned a Kindle DX, which I love, but when I saw the first ad for the Fire, I thought I had to try it. One of my office mates has an Ipad, which seemed pretty neat, but I thought it was a whole lot of money for a device that didn't have a real phone, plus I just wanted a real e-reader that could also surf the net and run a few other aps.After 5 days, I am very impressed with what $199 bought from Amazon. Every piece of technology we own, whether it's a car, a refrigerator, or a set of headphones is a compromise, and the Kindle Fire is as well. The compromises Amazon made just seem to be the right ones to me.First of all, the display is superb as a reader. Is it clearer than my DX screen? My wife and I think so, but it's at least as good. Books are not good -- they are great. Illustrations and other graphic data leap out at you, and once you get used to the touchscreen, it works pretty well. I do miss the quick ability to share notes and highlights as I do via Whispernet, but there is quite possibly a way to do it and I've just not discovered it yet.The handfeel of the unit is very solid, but light enough to be comfortable reading in one hand in bed or in the car. The screen is plenty bright and also fast enough to show regular definition video from Netflix in gorgeous color. While Amazon says it's not high-def, it certainly seems as high def as I need on a screen this size. My impression is that Amazon gave this the absolute best display, considering the tradeoffs of power consumption and weight.Another thing you need to be aware of is that although the Fire uses the same size and shape connector as the DX does (a USB micro), your USB charger from a Kindle DX or other USB micro device will not charge your Fire, I'm guessing the Fire needs more current to charge. I'm pretty sure this was a tradeoff to get this sexier display charged quickly.Sound is a bit different, though. It is absolutely adequate in a fairly quiet environment for audible book or television audio, but in a noisy environment such as a plane or office lobby, you will definitely want a nice set of noise-reduction headphones or earbuds. With a good pair, the music quality is quite good, as is movie audio. If you have purchased MP3s or videos from Amazon, then you will really enjoy them via this device. This device DOES play Audible audio-books, but I have not found anything about read-aloud ability (which I enjoy on my DX when riding in my car) on the Fire.Music brings up storage. I have over 300 books on mine, and used a bit over a GB of the 6+GB of storage claimed. I don't plan on using my device to listen to music that often when I'm away from Wi-fi (I have an Ipod with about 10,000 songs), but I've made the decision to leave almost all of music \"in the cloud\" with Amazon. I may download a few in case I need to \"drown out\"surroundings while away from wi-fi. Could there have been more storage included, including external smart cards of some kind? Sure, but I think it would have created more risk of allowing dust or water into the interior.The web and connectibility. One disappointment was that this device does not have Whispernet, which works well even in the rural community I live in. On the other had, the wi-fi is increadibly easy to set up and is getting rather close to ubiquitous when one travels. Suffice it to say that surfing and download speeds on both my home and office connections are sufficiently fast for me depending on the wi-fi signal, although I don't get books and other Amazon downloads as quickly as I did on Whispernet. Surfing the web is surprisingly useful and quick. Websites generally look great, but I look forward to learning more about how Amazon uses the cloud to supplement this with purchasing websites, before I trust all of my purchase or bank info to it. (Hey, I'm still not trusing cellphones, yet.) The Web is not my favorite implementation, but the typing interface from the touchscreen is absolutely great.I have heard some people complaining about processor speed, but I just don't see it with what I use it for. Aps seem to load fairly quickly -- dependent on the wi-fi signal. Video from YouTube can be choppy. My take is this is more a reflection of the signal than processor speed.A GPS would have been handy to interface with Maps and Aps, but would probably have significantly increased the weight, power consumption, and the price of the device. The aps themselves -- weather, video (Hulu+ and Netflix and I'm sure Amazon), and select other aps are there but not nearly as much as the Ipad. Haven't come upon must-have aps that are missing. You can do maps, for example, but the lack of a GPS just makes it a bit more work. No camera, but I can't see why I would miss one. I have not sent any documents to it from my computer network, but I haven't needed to. Documents I wanted to read came via the regular way -- emailing them to my Amazon Kindle mail for the device, and those documents have looked super.So, in my viewpoint, this isn't an Ipad, but it really fills my needs at a much cheaper price. With the smartphone I already own, I really don't think I needed to duplicate the GPS, the camera, and other things an Ipad would give me. The compromises Amazon made really fit a consumer like me. My advice is to find one of the available covers to give it protection (I use one by Marware), and then put it in a small bag with a little extra padding and room for your ear-buds and a charger. Be careful of the charger, because I ordered a spare and a prong broke off in shipping. For that reason, you'll want to wrap it up in some kind of padding.", "Date": "November 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not Perfect ...

After all the anticipation, it comes down to pulling one cardboard \"zipper\" on their \"Certified Frustration-free Packaging\" (you just have to love anyone who would print that on the shipping container), and lifting the lid.Inside is your Kindle Fire...and a power cord. That's it. Of course, it's a KINDLE, so the user's manual will be on the device itself. That makes sense. But the fact that for $199, the USB data cable is an extra cost option, should you wish to transfer something from a computer and not through the Amazon Cloud Drive, strikes me as a wee bit on the cheap side.The Kindle feels like a BlackBerry PlayBook. It has only one button, a small power button located on the bottom edge of the device (in portrait mode, anyway), next to the micro-USB port and the headphone jack. The internal speakers are located on the top edge. It weighs 14.5 ounces, and while that is quite a bit lighter than an iPad 2, it is quite a bit heavier than a standard Kindle. It seems well constructed and solid.Powering up the device for the first time, it immediately sets about finding a Wi-Fi connection. There's no 3G option for this tablet, but that isn't a huge issue for me. Our regular Kindle is the Wi-Fi only version and we've had no issues with that. Given the amount of streaming from the Amazon cloud and general web surfing you will do with the Kindle Fire, however, you might want to consider a \"hotspot\" feature with your smartphone, for data access anywhere you are. Once the Fire had connected to my home Wi-Fi network, it immediately downloaded and installed an update to the latest version of the \"Kindle System Software.\"That software is a HIGHLY customized version of Android 2.3, aka \"Gingerbread.\" When I say highly customized, I mean that in an absolute sense. You are completely walled off from the standard Android user interface. The home screen has a row of icons in a \"Cover Flow\" display (sorry, Apple, to borrow your term) that show things you've recently accessed. Books, magazines, videos (TV shows and movies), music, apps, and web sites will all be shown there. It's useful, but it's bigger than it needs to be. I never chased back more than three or four icons before I'd just tap the category at the top of the screen and find what I wanted that way.The row of categories across the very top are your primary command interface. Newsstand, Books, Music, Video, Docs, Apps, and Web. Right out of the box, my Fire had been pre-configured to my Amazon account, so the Books section was filled with our Kindle e-books that we'd already purchased, the Music section held all the music I'd purchased from Amazon or uploaded to the Cloud Player, and the Video section had the movies I'd purchased for online viewing.Selecting Apps shows you any apps that you've purchased or downloaded from the Amazon Appstore on your smartphone, and allows you to download them again to the Fire (assuming that they are \"Fire compatible,\" not ALL apps in the Appstore work on the Fire just yet). That's a nice touch, not having to re-purchase apps.Docs is an interesting option. Amazon refers to this as your \"Personal Documents\" and you can get them on your Fire by uploading them to your Personal Documents list under the \"Manage My Kindle\" option at the Amazon web site, or by emailing them to your Kindle or Kindle Fire from a pre-approved email address. Just attach the PDF or Office format document to the email. I'm sure you could also transfer it via the USB cable...if you spend the extra money to buy one.I subscribed to a magazine in the Newsstand and found browsing it on the Fire's bright screen to be a pleasure. You can view the original printed pages or select \"Text\" mode for easy reading of the articles. I found myself flipping back and forth frequently. It's a simple option you touch at the top of the screen.The performance of the Fire was very good. I felt no lag or slowdowns at any time. Several earlier reviewers talked about these problems, perhaps the software update my Fire downloaded first thing out of the box corrected it for my unit. Web pages load very fast and scroll smoothly. The dual core processor of the Kindle really flexes its muscle. Video playback was smooth, but buffering on the Netflix app caused some dropped frames at first. Amazon's video streaming seemed to suffer no such issues.My usual media apps worked perfectly. Netflix, Hulu+, Pandora, TuneIn Radio, etc., all ran without a hitch. My email experience was a bit more difficult, however. I assumed that I would be able to download and run the Gmail app just as I had on my smartphone. Not so. Amazon walls you off COMPLETELY from any app made by Google. It's not just the Android Market, it's ALL of the Google apps. Frankly, that's just silly, and I expect customer pressure will force them to add the Google apps to their Appstore. I understand about not wanting Android Market on the device, because you want to check and approve the apps (ala Apple and iTunes) before people can download them. But this seems petty and pointless. (By the way, if you're an ubergeek, there are already Kindle Fire hacks to put the Android Market and Google apps on the Fire. I'm not trying them, because I prefer to run, and review, stock machines.)The built in email program, however, has support for Gmail accounts, and it grabbed my contacts from there also. Once my email and contacts were on the Fire, it felt very much like \"my\" device, and the entire process took only a few minutes from unboxing. Maybe that's the magic of the Fire, how quickly it feels like \"your\" device. This is heavily dependent on how much content you already buy from Amazon. We already owned a Kindle device, we were already Amazon Prime subscribers (allowing free video streaming to the Fire), and I had already purchased virtually all of my digital music and movies from Amazon. For us, the Fire was a no-brainer. Using it was as easy as falling off a log.If you're a Barnes & Noble person, however, and have already made the investment in a monochrome Nook e-reader, you will likely find just as much happiness with the Color Nook Tablet as I found with the Fire. Just don't expect Barnes & Noble to have the depth of TV/movies, music, and Appstore offerings that Amazon has, because they don't. Much has been made of the Fire's limited on-device storage, 8GB as compared with the Nook's 16GB (expandable by up to 32GB with a micro-SD card). I've been running my Fire almost non-stop for two days and it's used hardly ANY of the on-device storage. It's smart about fetching things from the Amazon cloud and keeping them on the Fire only when you tell it you want offline access (for things like airplane trips, where you won't be near a Wi-Fi connection).I still insist that the Kindle Fire is NOT an Android tablet. You are locked out from too much of the Android interface and too limited in what apps you can run for this to be viable as a general purpose Android tablet. This is a KINDLE, first, second, and third, and only an Android tablet as a very distant fourth. If you know this going in, you will not be disappointed in the Fire, but if you're expecting a small iPad for $200, you're heading for a letdown.I like the Kindle Fire, very much. I'm pleased with my purchase. But, and this is a BIG but, I was already plugged in heavily to the Amazon ecosystem of content.

See the bottom of this review for 'pro-tips' / warnings ]I *love* this tablet.I've got an iPad, several laptops, a netbook, several PC's, two smart phones, a Kindle 3, and now a Kindle Fire. Of all of these, the Fire is officially my favorite. At least, for home use.Why? Because it does what I care about, it does it well, and it is incredibly cheap!Amazon could have chosen to make the Fire solely a kindle media reader. Instead they've provided a general android tablet with a reasonable sized, bright display, good battery life, built-in networking, a nice touch interface, and an AWESOME price.My core requirements are listed below, all met flawlessly by the Kindle Fire:+ Effective kindle reader. I like my Kindle 3, but I *love* this. I read in the dark a lot more than I read in bright sunlight, and with the new display, I can read easily in bed without bothering my wife! The reader also feels snappier than my Kindle-3 reader in terms of responsiveness, and the color is nice for color media.+ Decent web browser. I'm able to browse the parts of the web I care about easily. Also, for academics it's easy for me to find PDF files for scientific papers and be able to read them. Hooray!+ Good video. I'm able to watch youtube, Netflix, and amazon videos, all with no problems. The widescreen display shows the videos at a size not much smaller than my iPad, and wonderfully rendered.+ A reasonable app store for extensibility. I'm still exploring, but so far it's adequate. I haven't found as much high-quality free content as I found for the iPad, but there's certainly a ton of stuff available.The Fire is about the same size as my Kindle 3 in its case, but is surprisingly heavy. I chalk this up to the battery which is supposed to let you watch video for a shocking 8 hours! The weight is noticable, but I wouldn't say it's annoying.Overall I love this device! I am looking forward to being able to read at night, and to having my own private netflix, youtube, and amazon video viewer!!!Pro:+ cheap!!+ Good display+ Nice battery life+ Good web browsing+ can read PDF's, watch youtube, and watch netflix+ Can view JPG photos, watch my own MP4 movies, and presumably play MP3 audioCon:- interface is a little spartan, takes some getting used to. Maybe this is Android in general?- a little heavy.- Looks like no proxy support for browsing across firewalls. No work fun for me :(I love it! I think I'm going to buy another one so we have two in the house!PRO-WARNINGS:Here are some issues I tripped across while playing more extensively with the Kindle Fire- NO PROXY SUPPORT FOR WEB BROWSING. I brought the kindle fire into work. I was able to connect to the corporate wireless network just fine, which was impressive (windows domain account). However, there's no web proxy setting in the browser, so I can't use the corporate proxy, and hence can't reach any of the internet services (including amazon's!) I wanted.- NO TTS (TEXT TO SPEECH) SUPPORT. I got hooked on having my Kindle 3 read books to me sometimes. This isn't an option with the Kindle Fire, the current version does not support speech output of your books.- NO NATIVE SUPPORT FOR WMV / WMA files. I copied some of my ripped music and ripped movies to the Kindle, but they were unable to play. I usually rip with windows media player formats, which are WMV's and WMA's. If you want your media to work on the Kindle, rip MP3's / MP4's and you should be alright.- ALWAYS CHARGE FROM AN AC OUTLET. You can charge from a USB cable hooked to your computer. However, USB has a limited amount of juice, and I've found that the Kindle Fire charges very slowly from the computer. If I hook it up to the included AC adapter and charging cable, then I can charge from almost no power to full power in about 3 hours.", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire blazes it's own trail", "Author": "G. Cline", "ReviewID": "R20ANIXBK7VFU0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been playing with my Kindle Fire tonight, and here are some of my early observations. I have to warn you, I am an Amazon fan boy (I have a lot of friends that are Apple fanboys, I won't name them, they know who they are, and I might be one too).I don't think it is fair to compare it to an iPad 2, but that is about the closest thing you will find out there and I own both, so it makes it easy. The screen size is 7\" (16x9 ratio) where the iPad is 10\" (4x3 ratio), the picture on the Fire is pretty awesome, it has a higher ppi (pixels per inch) than the ipad2.It doesn't look like an Android tablet at all, Amazon has really put a lot of work into making it not look like Android (not to mention the fact that they never use the term Android in their marketing material). It is very responsive and it feels very solid.I have loaded up a video in mp4 format, works great. The Prime Video streaming is a really nice feature (if you are a prime member). I still dislike the interface to prime video. They don't have a queue system, so it is really hard to find (and remember) videos you want to watch in the future.I have a good amount of my music in the Amazon cloud, you get 5GB of free storage, and 20GB for $20/year. They had a deal a while back, buy any album, and get 20GB for a year, for free. The big difference between this and the Apple Cloud is that you can stream from Amazon, you don't have to download first, then play. This works for videos too! If you buy or rent a movie from Amazon, it can download to your device, and/or you can stream it. So you don't have to wait for it to download.The form factor is nice, super easy to hold in one hand (I do have big hands). The 16x9 viewing ration is really nice for watching videos. I am not crazy about the speakers, they are on the top (the end that points up, not the front) it is kind of odd, but they sound pretty good (not great).The downside is definitely the storage. It has 8GB on board, 6.5GB of useable space, with no expansion. That is a serious bummer for me, but not a deal breaker. You can store a lot of apps on there, and a few videos. Amazon does one thing really well, they no how to sell and everything they do is done to bring more people to their site/apps, and this is no different. I did notice that a few times I hit a button on the screen, I either missed it, or it wasn't responding. Not sure which. It has no lag, which was an issue in early Android phones.If you are looking for a tablet, and don't want to spend $500, this is a good option at $200. I still prefer my iPad, but if you want a tablet and and don't want to spend $500, this is a nice alternative.", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "It's about the ecosystem and Fire is off to a great start", "Author": "JMC", "ReviewID": "R1AY1U1G2D1S0B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Here's the bottom line.  There are people out there who want a totally open device that they can load anything and everything they want, in any format, from any source they choose.  This is not that device.  This is a device that is taking a play out of Apple's playbook and creating a device where it's really really obvious and intuitive how to get content (Amazon Book Store, Amazon App Store, Amazon Video on Demand, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, Hulu, etc.) along with email, social networking, and the web.  This obviousness is good for Amazon and the Fire.I own an iPad and have since they came out.  The magic of that device is that it just works exactly as you expect all the time. I also own an Android tablet.  It's good and runs stuff from any source, but you kind of have to have some geek in you since with openness comes complexity. The Kindle Fire is squarely in the iPad camp of being an integrated system of software and hardware, and I expect it will have that key attribute of working exactly as you'd expect all the time.Here are my pros and cons;PROS:- Feels solid and well built- Interface is simple and obvious to use- Screen is bright and clear- Video playback is smooth from Amazon, Netflix, and Hulu- Email is simple to set up- Social networking apps (read: Facebook)- Adding apps was every bit as easy as it is on an iPad- Network configuration and other settings are obvious and easy- Wifi performance was really good.  Detected network access points with good range.CONS:- Web Browser is a little slower than expected, but I suspect Amazon and tweak in time- Interface can be a little jerky when scrolling and not quite as smooth as expected, but again I'm sure this can be tweaked in time- Geeking out for a moment, I did not find a DLNA client app in the App Store.  Hopefully Amazon will certify one so I can stream home movies from my PC to the device.So, my bottom line is that this is a device that's built around the Amazon services and that's good.  Really really easy to use and expect the little bit of interface and browser performance issues to be resolved in time (and they are minor in the grand scheme of things).This is a really good device in general, and at $200 is a bargain.", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Incredible product which will be a great seller.", "Author": "globiz", "ReviewID": "RJ6UXZG10HDUG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There are a lot of people who will be nitpicky with the Kindle Fire considering how many other tablets there are out there from Apple and the other Android-based manufacturers, but I can tell you right now that Amazon has a winner. I went into this purchase with no pre-conceptions, never having owned a tablet or a smart phone before and I can tell you that whatever research Amazon did in the creation of the Kindle Fire was dead-on. It's simple and easy to operate straight out of the box. Most of the problems with the operation will come from people who haven't got a lot of experience with tech-y gadgets. I found that even without the separate Android home button, etc., it didn't take that much time to learn how to use the touch-only controls.I think the one sure way to tell whether a product is a winner is that no one in our household could put the Kindle Fire down for hours after I took delivery. From me, a 51-year-old sort-of technophile, to my landlord's 20=year-old son amd a 17-year-old friend of the family, once I began downloading apps and accessing the web there was something for everyone that kept us enjoying this product for hours on end. It's like electronic crack! I love this thing and any trepidation I may have experienced was quickly dispelled by the response to it which we had. The Kindle Fire is FUN...it's EASY...and did I already say it's FUN! I can't encourage anyone who has been on the fence enough. BUY this product. Even if you don't use the Amazon Prime subscription, you still have Netflix and the thousands of other apps you can get in the Amazon apps market and the thousands more that I'm sure that they will have because  of the enormous sales the Fire will generate.There are a few things that I had problems with- my Fire was registered to someone else when I received it. Understandable since they have sold so many in advance. \"Nancy\",I have your Kindle and it's now registered to me after a few easy keystrokes. LOL I downloaded the apps for a couple of the Conde' Nast magazines and have gotten error messages while trying to generate my trial subscriptions, but I plan to take care of that situation tomorrow with the Amazon customer service people who rapidly responded to my email about the situation. I can't see these things stopping me from giving the Kindle Fire a five star rating. They are a relatively simple fix and you have to be pretty bitchy to allow these things to keep you from buying the product. We even have someone at the house who doesn't watch television who we have been enticing with Youtube and \"Angry Birds\". He hasn't surrendered yet, but I did get him to fiddle with the keyboard. He was concerned that he might spend too much time enjoying himself with the Fire, but I'm sure that eventually we will have him as \"one of us\".The screen is fabulous. The ease of access to Amazon products, is, of course, amazing. But you are not necessarily limited to only Amazon apps and products. Once you have used the browser for a bit, it learns and gets faster. You have apps for Netflix, Pandora, and slacker.com(one of my favorite internet music venues). I only hope that the Amazon app market picks up apps for sites like crackle.com and others with even more free media product.If you are an older user, don't be afraid to try something new. I have a laptop and I don't always feel like carrying it to the coffeeshop with me. Sometimes I just want something to read, listen to, or watch while I'm having a coffee or sandwich and the Kindle Fire is perfect for that. So it doesn't have 3G or 4G, just wi-fi. Well,wi-fi is pretty much ubiquitous in many areas and you can get tethered service to your cell phone in others. I think that most Starbucks had free wi-fi and one of the shops I go to gives you free access for the cost of buying a coffee. Enjoy yourselves, people. This is a wonderful media-consumption device which will ultimately be easy for everyone to use.I'm sorry if I gush, and i'm sure I'll be criticized for it, but anything that has this disparate group where I live enjoying themselves in so many different ways for hours at a time just has to be praised.

I had looked into possibly getting an ipad but it was waaaay to bulky and I just didn't like the way it felt. When this was announced i got excited and knew I had to get it. I got it today on launch day and have played with it for a bit,  it has actually blown my expectations out of the water. I had read some bad reviews, so I was really scared I wasn't going to like it or be very disappointed. Thankfully, I am not!This review is based solely on the perspective of someone who was looking to buy a reasonably priced tablet/ereader for the first time.*PROS**Love the look, it sleek, sharp, and the display is beautiful. I was amazed at how chic it looks. Love the feel and security of the rubber back.*The audio is actually a lot louder than what I expected, ALWAYS a plus(we can raise the roof with my KF)!*The response of the touch screen so far has been extremely responsive and have had no issues.*THE SILK browser is FAST, I don't know about the people who feel that it isn't as fast as they thought, because quite frankly to me it is. I would almost say it's on par with my laptop on wifi! Very pleasantly surprised.*All the stuff I have downloaded has had no issue and was lighting fast in installing. The email function is great, I have read a review somewhere where they did not like it but, it was sooo easy to set up!*Video is crisp, sharp, and very vivid, my netflix videos stream quickly and with great resolution(obviously depending on your connection)as well as my prime videos!****There are several apps in the android market that let you turn your android device into a mobile hotspot for free. Someone said it didn't support ad hoc connection or something, but I found that my kindle easily connected to my phone, so now I have an unlimited constant 3g connection on my kindle wherever I go!!!!*THE PRICE!!*Items on my cloud are so easily accessible, I forget they are not physically installed on my Kf.There is honestly so much more that I love about it so far, I could go on. So for the sake of not making this too long I'll move on.**CONS***For some reason it's a bit smaller and heavier than I thought, but I quickly adapted and got use to it. So not really a major issue, I could see where if you are use to a bigger device/tablet it might take a bit getting use to. On the plus side it is heavy enough to bludgeon a nook/ipad fanatic with... JK;)*While I charged it, it got pretty hot where I'm assuming the battery is. I didn't read anywhere that it could overheat, so it is an issue that does concern me, anyone else notice this?*The interface with all your recent/views and apps piled in a row might take a bit getting use to, but not a deal breaker at all.Perhaps it's because I have never really owned anything like it before that makes me really love and appreciate this little amazingly priced guy. If you are new to the tablet/e-reader experience I definitely recommend this product. Although I know some people don't like reading on back lit devices. If you own a smart phone I recommend downloading the Kindle app and try reading something on it for a while to see if it bothers your eyes. I have read a whole book on my android phone with no problem at all, which is what actually swayed me to buy this as an ereader too.

It is my understanding that the Kindle Fire is the only Kindle that does not come with the USB cable.  So, I have ordered the cable and once received I am to call back to see if they can perform a System Batch Update so that I can register the darn thing.  Basically, I've had it for almost a week and I still cannot use even one function on it except for the on/off switch AND I had to pay for a USB cable for an system update that should have been corrected before it was shipped.

While I prefer the E Ink Pearl display on my Kindle DX for an extended period of book reading, the Kindle Fire certainly performs adequately in this regard as long as I set the brightness level a little lower than I might otherwise have it for general use. The Kindle Fire is backlit, and the reading screen has a blue-gray tinge as opposed to the subtle, darker gray of the E Ink display, but it serves fairly well as a reader.Speaking of brightness, if you are outside, the Kindle Fire display is almost invisible. It is easily viewable indoors but not outdoors, so take that into consideration when considering one of these. The E Ink display found on other non-backlit Kindles does not have this limitation.The touch navigation is definitely superior on the Fire to the button-pushing style of some other Kindle models. I downloaded all my book content within a couple of minutes. It took just seconds per book. Highlighting is easy once you get the hang of it. It puts a nice yellow \"highlighter pen\" swipe across the selected passage. Although the Fire is much smaller than my generously sized DX, at 7 inches its screen is decently sized since no space is taken up by a keyboard or buttons.You get 5.37 GB of available storage on the unit itself, but Amazon gives you a similar amount of free storage on the cloud. For a nominal fee you can purchase additional cloud storage beyond that. Amazon-purchased content does not count against this limit. To provide an idea of space requirements, I just loaded 154 non-Amazon mp3 Beatles songs compressed at a high-quality 256KB bit rate and they consumed 750 MB or about three quarters of a gigabyte.The sound quality is good. There is a spot to plug in headphones on the bottom. One minor problem: the power button, located next to the headphone plug-in, is in a place that's easy to accidentally bump, resulting in the device being turned off unexpectedly. This button should really be relocated elsewhere, as it's too easy to brush up against when doing a variety of tasks.Web browsing is quick and easy on the Kindle Fire. No, it's not going to replace your desktop or laptop, but it's a great portable unit for doing so. Web pages load very fast. You just need a Wi-Fi connection for web browsing. Naturally, not all visible Wi-Fi connections will be accessible. Most will be locked and accordingly will require a password. Such networks display a lock symbol next to the name. Once you're connected to a network, it will automatically connect in the future if that network is in range when searching for a Wi-Fi connection.I set up my four personal and business e-mail accounts to retrieve to the Kindle Fire using the provided e-mail app. I saw a user complaint posted about e-mail setup requiring programming, and it's true that, in addition to user name and password, you will need to supply the incoming and outgoing server names. You'll also need the correct port number and will have to indicate whether or not SSL should be turned on. I got all of these settings out of my home PC's Microsoft Outlook (Tools/E-Mail Accounts) where I have all my e-mail retrieved into a common InBox currently. So if you have no idea what your POP3 server is, and so on, this may be a frustrating experience. But if you know where to find this info for any given e-mail account, it's pretty straightforward.You have your choice of auto or manual retrieval of e-mail. You can choose silent notification of new mail arrival or select from a variety of notification sounds. You can opt to view separate e-mail accounts in their own InBoxes or make use of the Unified InBox, which shows them all grouped together. It's nice to have all my e-mail accessible in a small, portable device.Video looks very crisp on the Kindle Fire. There's a lot of free video content on Amazon with the purchase of Amazon Prime, which I may consider after my complementary month of Prime expires. I streamed some free items from Amazon just to test things out.I got my Kindle Fire along with a leather case that can fold back to allow for easy holding with one hand. It can also serve as a table top type of stand for viewing video. It has a handy elastic strap so you can keep it closed for carrying securely.All in all, this is a very nice Kindle. It's meant to be a versatile, all-in-one type of device--video, music, reading, games, web browsing and so on. At an astounding current price of $199, it's hard to be too critical of it.

This is the first (and only tablet) I've ever owned, and it has met my needs almost perfectly. I use virtually every feature it offers - I read books on it, listen to music, browse the web, check & send email, watch videos, and use apps (games and practical ones).Pros:-The clarity is beautiful; the graphics equal that of my Sony computer.-It was easy to start using the Kindle Fire right away. There wasn't really any learning curve for doing basic tasks on it.-It can do virtually everything my computer can do, and that means I can spend less time in front of the computer by doing some of my work-related tasks on the Kindle Fire instead.-The battery holds a charge for at least a day even with heavy usage.-The clarity of sound is excellent too. I've listened to music and to spoken audios, and both sound excellent.-It's quick to pick up wifi signals in my vicinity. I've had no trouble whatsoever getting it to access the internet at home or when I'm out & about.Cons (or \"What I Wish the Kindle Fire Did\"):-No microphone-No GPS capability (At least one app sold in the Kindle app store requires GPS, so it seems stupid that a) the Kindle Fire has no GPS and b) that app is being advertised directly to Kindle Fire users.)-I wish it could communicate with my wireless printer so I could print documents, webpages, recipes, etc. directly from the Kindle Fire.-Video playback is sometimes draggy. I don't think that's due to my internet connection because videos play fine on all the computers in my house. I can certainly watch streaming videos on the Kindle Fire, but it takes a little patience. :-)-The audio could be a bit louder. Sometimes it's hard to hear music or other audio if the washer's running nearby or the kids are playing loudly, etc. Using headphones solves the volume issue but isn't always practical.-It's extremely easy to purchase apps or other items with just one click - even if that click is accidental! It's also easy to put a parental password onto the device and set my Amazon account so that the password is required for any mobile purchases, BUT Amazon should spell this out more clearly to everyone who purchases a Kindle Fire.

My first question was, \"do I really need a tablet?\" I have a desktop computer, a laptop computer and an iPod Touch. Is a tablet necessary? No, it's not. I believe there are few people who actually \"need\" a tablet. However, there are many, many more who will get function, use, joy, happiness and entertainment from a tablet. The Kindle is a perfect size to carry with you. I found it fits in a cargo pants' pocket! Get one of the cases on Amazon and it's a joy to carry, even easier than an paperback. In conclusion I decided I didn't need a Kindle Fire...just not necessary. But for under 200 bucks???? It's a no brainer, you have to have it.Next, which tablet? Well knowing what I know now, you have to have the Kindle Fire. I check my email on it, I surf the web on it, I can send texts on it (all of course while connected to the web, and who isn't?), I have my photographs on it and I am a photographer.

Maybe there are a few disgruntled users, who through user error or who may have gotten a bad sample write nasty things...and the apple fanboys who dis it. This Kindle rocks. It does what it is advertised to do and more. The development team is responsive. There was a problem with kids buying stuff..well they put parental locks on the machines. The Kindle Fire team rocks. Amazon is a name you can trust. Even though I bought my Kindle at Sams Club..figuring if I wasn't happy I could return it easier...cost me more that way though. I am NOT returning this Kindle Fire. It just works....and did I mention it only cost 200 bucks.What do you get for four times the cost of a Kindle Fire? More memory...do you need it? Probably not. I use the cloud for many things and some data does reside on the 8 Gigs in the machine. I probably won't fill it up. You get a bigger screen, and bulk. You get more apps, I have all I need in the Amazon store. There are more everyday. You get 4g, if you need it get it. Yes, you get a faster processor, but no where NEAR four times as fast. I mean you can't beat this with a stick for 200 bucks.Yes, I looked at all the reviews on Amazon and the tech sites....You gotta love the Kindle. It just does what you want it do. OH AND DID I MENTION BOOKS????? Wow. There are many free books, many books you can get directly from the public library (my personal killer application), and books from Prime. Don't get me started on prime. For way less than 7 bucks a month you get a great deal. Just look it up, 2 day shipping! Books to borrow. Movies to watch, special deals.....I mean prime is choice...BTW you get a month free..so that brings the Kindle price down to 193! Holy cow. Which is one reason why that magazine that \"reports to consumers\" gave it a best buy rating...and only one other tablet got it...it wasn't an apple.Are you excited yet? You should be. And for the price of dinner for 8 at a good restaurant you can be awe struck by the Kindle. Don't wait for two months like I did. Get it now. You won't be sorry.

To be honest I am very pleased with the Kindle Fire with one caveat, if you're wanting all of the features of an Ipad then this is not for you. That being said it works very well and has many pluses and a few detractors. You'll have to decide if the detractors steer you away from this device. First of all the KF is very sturdy and well built. In fact I have actually dropped in the protective case that I have and it didn't cause any damage what so ever. I would recommend getting a protective cover and screen protective covering as well. I have had one since I had my KF and it is scratch free, even in this harsh environment in Afghanistan. The operation of the device is very simple. When getting it through Amazon's website it will already be synched with your Amazon account. If not you will have to do this, though it's also very easy to set up. The operating system for the KF works well enough, and I have not had any issues with it. The wifi works well most of the time, though I have had a problem or 2 with it dropping connections but they are quickly reestablished automatically. Downloading kindle books you have purchases are done automatically and very quickly in the background of the KF when ever using a wifi connection. Downloading apps is also easy and simple. I would suggest downloading one of the free security application for virus and firewall protection as soon as possible to protect your content, there are several free ones on Amazons apps site. Uploading of content from your computer is very easy. If your files are avi files you will have to download the AVI app from Amazon for $.99, though it is worth it. It was a little frustrating that this common type of a file was not able to be used free of charge on the KF, but it's only $.99 to get them to work. To put movies on your KF simple drag and drop, copy, and paste, or any other way that you would with an external hard drive or other device. Movies look very good on the screen and I am very pleased with the resolution on the device. I watched movies on the way to Afghanistan and the KF lasted right under 6 hours of movie watching time. The speakers on the KF are horrible, I can barely hear them when turned all the way up. I suspect this is because someone had the silly notion of placing the speakers on the bottom edge and they get drowned out. I only use headphones with it though which works just fine, in fact if you have good quality headphones the sound is superb. Not as good as other devices but not terrible in my view. Overall a very good experience so far in this department.  Playing video games is pretty good on the KF. Of course I play angry birds and it plays very well. There is no lag time so far that I have notice or encountered. The games look very good, even when not in HD. In fact I don't really see a need to play games in HD on the KF as I have not seen one that is does not look very good yet. Using the internet is a pretty good experience, though I have encountered a few glitches. Using the apps for facebook and twitter bring up the internet browser, Amazon calls it Silk, and it works pretty well. Though I have to admit I have an IPod touch and when using the KF and the IPod touch the iPod Touch is a tad bit faster when using the same net work and apps, the time is not substantially more but still noticeable. When using the internet the Silk will automatically open websites in mobile mode for websites that have it, you can click on the tab for the full site view on these mobile sites if you don't want to use the mobile mode. Pictures and heavy detailed items opened noticeable slower than they did on my iPod touch. I have had only one minor internet issue and that was fixed very easily after contacting Amazons support department. The touch screen on the KF is very good. The protective covering I use has not dampened the screens responsiveness. I would recommend using a matte screen protector. I have used both a matte and clear coverings and the glare from the clear screen cover is blinding. Viewing the KF from multiple different angles is not a problem. The touch keyboard works best in page mode for me rather than landscape. The spelling correction shows several spellings above the keyboard that can be easily selected. That being said the automatic spelling correction can be very frustrating and make for some obviously ridiculous inserts on typing. My point is if you plan to type a paper on this device you will be awfully disappointed. Though that is not what this device was built for in my opinion, if that's what you are looking for then some other tablet is what you need to purchase. Reading books on the KF is awesome. I have purchased several books for my college classes, which has saved me about 50% on my books and they have worked great. The only drawback is that it doesn't list the page numbers, but that's really not an issue worth fretting over. As stated earlier when purchasing the books they will download automatically and quickly. This has been a great experience. The Amazon App store is constantly adding new apps to their site. It has a nice library, but it is no where near the size of the android market or apples library. I have been unable to find my banks app yet because it doesn't exist. I can though go through the internet on the KF and get the site just fine. Overall this is a work in progress, but Amazon is constantly updating and improving their library. The majority of the apps are the same price as android market or less. Overall I am very pleased with the Kindle Fire. The fact that it doesn't have a camera or microphone is not an issue because that is one of the many compromises Amazon made in order to make this device $199. If that is deal breaker for you then its obvious this device is not for you. As for the actual device construction it's a bit heavy but that's because it is very solidly built, it's made to last in my opinion. Surfing the internet, using Amazon apps, and watching movies work very well. Just remember that the speakers are terrible, but then again it's a compromise and most people will be using headphones anyways. I took one star away becuase of the speakers being so poor and the AVI issues i spoke of. After 2 and \u00bd months I am very pleased with this and very happy my wife got it for me to bring on my long journey.

Please keep in mind I am not a professional reviewer and I'm not a tech geek. This review is MAINLY based on my experience thus far. To start, before I buy anything that's over $100 I make sure to do my research (I am very cheap when it comes to spending money). It seems as though a lot of the negative reviews on this product are based on little things that they would have known if they did their homework. I bought this product for one thing; media consumption. Occasionally at my job, I have to sit at a desk for 10+ hours with nothing to do. I primarily bought the Kindle for watching movies and shows. After my Kindle arrived, within minutes it booted up per-registered and I immediately downloaded the essential apps (Netflix, Pandora, and Hulu Plus). There has only been a handful of times that I can say I got aggravated with my streaming experience. Let me tell you though, that has nothing to do with the Kindle. If your bandwidth drops on your WiFi, well your Kindle isn't a miracle worker, it needs a good WiFi connection to provide fast performance. I get annoyed when I see poor reviews because he or she wasn't happy with how slow their Kindle is. I have loaded some pretty complex sites on my device and it loaded without a problem! If you have a decent WiFi connection, this baby is FAST. Another thing I am very impressed with is the screen resolution. The colors are vibrant, videos run smoothly, and the screen is bright. Although the screen size isn't exactly huge, I find it a very comfortable size and is big enough to enjoy your shows and movies. I am not going to compare this product to that of a iPad. They are the same concept, but two different products made by different companies. I myself am a Apple \"nerd\" but that did not stop me from buying a Fire and I have NOT regretted it since. I absolutely love this Device. With a price tag of $199, it's practically a steal. If you're looking to read the news, maybe some books (and graphic novels), watch movies, shows, and don't have a Champagne income? Don't hesitate any longer. BUY THIS NOW!

That was my sign. I brought it home, plugged it in, searched my house for my WIFI password for 20 min and I was ready to go. I thought I would buy this item to read more. I like to read in bed, but its hard with a booklight because my 2 yr old is sleeping right next to me.In the first couple days I read two books. I started to play with it a little more due to a lot of doctors appts. At first, I would stop breathing if my daughter even looked at the thing, this past week she was sick and admitted to the hospital for a couple days. The Fire is what kept us sane and laughing. We download the most silly apps we could find and she loved them! By the end she was pounding on the screen and I wasnt thinking about it. I cant believe how durable this thing is. I get to read her books before she goes to bed at night and play games together when we have downtime.(She gets a little carried away with the keyboard on the laptop, which is not an issuse here).Anyway, if you are reading this review and are on the fence about which one to buy...buy this one! It has everything you want and sooo much more!! I like the fact that I can go get an Amazon gift card and load it to my account and I dont need to use my credit card everytime I buy a .99 app.This is the first review I have ever written, about anything, thats how much I love my Fire!

And I must say, after going through all the reviews on Amazon that say not to buy the Fire, I found them all to be totally incorrect.One of the repeating \"cons\" that I saw, was that the power button was on the bottom, making it very easy to accidentally turn off. I've never had this problem. I read, watch movies/tv shows, play games, write emails, go on Facebook, all the time on my Kindle, and I think you'd have to try REALLY hard to \"accidentally turn it off\".The next thing I saw was the Fire has a lack of privacy, with everything you just watched showing up on the Carousel. Well guess what, if you hold your finger down on any icon on your main menu/Carousel, there's an option to remove it from the Carousel. So there.Various reviews complained about the browser being slow.. but I say unless you're some computer geek with a really souped-up computer system, it's not slow at all. It's incredibly easy to type on the keyboard function, and web pages load pretty quickly. It's super easy to sync all your email accounts to the Kindle Fire, and the notifications let you know when you have new messages.I haven't been able to put my Fire down since I got it, I love everything about it, and encourage people to take poor reviews with a grain of salt, because most of them are misinformed or biased!", "Date": "January 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Few Things To Note", "Author": "Student", "ReviewID": "ROOH02ZP50STV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not going to cover all the basic stuff that is in thousands of other reviews.  Here are a few random things that may help someone out there:- The latest firmware update (12-22-11) greatly improved touch response and browser speeds as well as letting you delete things from the carousel (which some users don't like but I find it useful and a lot of fun).  It also let's you password protect wireless which can help if you have kids or other people using your device and don't want them purchasing things.- You can sideload apps onto it; meaning you can put apps/games/books etc that don't come from Amazon.  No, this doesn't have the Android marketplace but it is easy to load stuff from say, your phone without having to root the Kindle.- If you don't like the default web browser I would recommend sideloading Dolphin HD which works great and provides a few extra features.- You can also change the default interface this way by installing a launcher such as GoLauncher from the Android marketplace.  This gives you a bit more control and pretty much makes it like an android phone.  I tried this but quite like the stock interface because it reminds me that it IS a kindle and not my smartphone.- This isn't as fast as the iPad and it isn't supposed to be.  I find it to be very usable however I did suffer from unregistered taps and a bit of lag overall.  With the latest firmware update it feels much smoother and I don't have nearly as many hiccups.- For some reason uploading anything except music to the Amazon cloud WILL NOT appear on your Fire!  This is a big issue that needs to be addressed.  I don't find it to be a problem because books are so small and I'm fine with having 1 or 2 videos loaded for a trip.- The Fire takes a bit longer than I would like to charge up (it comes fully charged fyi which was a pleasant surprise).  The battery life in general is pretty good, I can usually go the whole day and just charge it up at night.- There is no camera or microphone.- There is glare from the LCD which makes it difficult to read/see outdoors.  I do enjoy reading on this very much though, but if you read primarily outside or with a lot of bright ambient light you should be aware of the glare issue which all LCDs suffer from.- If you read at night I would recommend sideloading an app called screen filter - which reduces the brightness even below the lowest you can normally do on the Fire.  It is still a bit bright in a completely dim room and this helps.All in all I am very happy with the Kindle Fire!  I was planning on paying ~$500 for a bigger tablet and I am so glad I didn't.  That is a lot of money for a luxury device in my opinion. The Fire is very solidly built and the screen is killer.  The only thing I wish it had was a front facing camera for video chats but I can live without it.I really like the size and weight as well.  I picked up a case that makes it look like an old book (from Versa) and I have been loving this thing ever since.  Apps and games run great, you can tweak it a bit by loading a custom launcher or sideloading apps, even root it and install cyanogen mod if you like.  I haven't felt the need to change much of anything though.  I like the stock look and feel and everything is well integrated and very easy to navigate.  I use this for listening to music/audio books/pandora, surfing the web, email, streaming vids, playing games, reading news and of course reading books.  It does all of these things perfectly well.  I love the size and most of all I love the price.  It isn't a 7\" ipad and if you expect it to be you will probably be disappointed.

They can't stop comparing it to the iPad, which is more than twice the cost.

It's a great product.  Is the interface a little sluggish at times?  Maybe once in a while.  Does the touch screen on occasion not respond to your finger?  Yes, sometimes.

No regrets.", "Author": "RickMc", "ReviewID": "R27EE42GCM3V1P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a fan of Apple. I have been since my first Apple product, the iPod Touch. So, of course, I have been considering an iPad since the 1st generation tablet was introduced. I waited and waited, and the price remained a deterrent.  Enter Amazon and the Kindle Fire.  After becoming a near-expert on Kindle Fire reviews, I felt adequately informed to make a decision. Even after test driving the iPad, I still pre-ordered the Kindle Fire. After a couple weeks of enjoying my new tablet, I have no regrets. So far, the Fire has almost everything I wanted, and has everything I needed from the iPad.  Here's what I love about the Fire and I think this list provides a little insight into how Amazon convinced me to branch out from the Apple tree:1) Portability: The Kindle Keyboard reader (a recent gift from my wife) sold me on this feature. I wanted a tablet that would slide in my coat pocket just like the Kindle. Being able to hold the device in one hand while watching videos or reading magazines was a big selling point for me. One sign of the Fire's success: iPad owners are starting to dream of a 5x7 iPad. Did anyone ever think that another company would create a format that Apple devotees would want to adopt? Especially a format that Steve Jobs so readily dismissed.2) Key App Selection: Yes, Amazon has a limited selection of apps compared to Apple. Really, though, how many of those million apps from iTunes are junk? How many of them just clutter the marketplace as you look for ones you really want or need? Don't get me wrong, I like a greater pool of choices. But I consider the limited selection something that will soon change once app developers see the number of Fires sold. Until then, there were a few key apps that I wanted on the iPad, and when I saw them available on the Fire, it helped me make my choice. Email, art, media, and document production and editing apps all gave me the full features I wanted. From a customer satisfaction standpoint, I am really impressed with Amazon's free app every day. To everyone labeling the Fire as simply an entertainment tablet: I've been pleasantly surprised at how much productivity it offers. I've got apps to create full documents and presentations, email access, and Sketchbook Pro, just to name a few of the apps that are helping me create and not just process others' creations.3) Magazines: I get too many print magazines. Most come free from old airline miles I cashed in and I enjoy them, but the stacks are growing and I've wanted to recycle them. The Kindle Fire's digital magazines look great, notably Wired magazine, which I've read for a couple years in print. I saw complaints in other reviews about the magazine format on the Fire. I don't have that complaint. The Fire doesn't have the real estate that the iPad offers, but I feel the magazine format doesn't lose its impact on the smaller screen. Note regarding the screen-size comparisons and reading complaints: I got the feeling with many reviews I read that most of the reviewers were reviewing the Kindle Fire from a stepping-down perspective, i.e., comparing everything to how it looked on the iPad. That's fine, but I think it's also unrealistic. I think many customers are moving up to the Fire from their smart phones. I've spent three years reading magazines, articles, and websites on the iPod Touch, zooming in and out to get the page view I wanted. That's not a complaint. It's a statement of how accepting we are of that format. For all the big numbers of iPads sold, the iPod Touch and iPhone has sold more. Isn't it possible that millions of people will feel like the Kindle Fire gives them extra screen-size in comparison to their phones?4) Comic Books: Yep, this was an attraction for the iPad. Marvel Comics' app was one of the early iPad apps promoted in various reviews, and not just by geeks and comics fans. As soon as I saw the Comixology app for the Fire, I knew I was getting closer to making my decision. I don't think the iPad or any other digital device gives the true reading experience of a comic book. There's something about the timing of comics and sequential art that can't be captured in an eReader in the way that a traditional book can be transferred. However, Comixology does a good job with their digital comics and for economic reasons, I love the option of buying comics for less than the typical $3.99 cover price, not to mention the free comics and previews available.5) Freebies: The Kindle Fire has been criticized as nothing more than a sleek portal into Amazon that allows you to spend more money on Amazon products. I disagree. After two weeks my Fire was loaded with apps and I hadn't spent a dime. Amazon has actually made this possible with free apps every day, a number of free apps available from developers, and the free trial subscriptions to magazines and videos. After two weeks, I finally purchased a couple apps, as Amazon knows will happen for other Fire customers. I like the fact, though, that I can be productive and entertained without feeling like I have to send a constant stream of money to Amazon. The customer service impact from this is incredible.  For hundreds of dollars less, I got a tablet that does everything I wanted the iPad to do. As someone who wouldn't consider any product outside the Apple orchard until a couple months ago, I'm glad to say that the Fire has converted me.", "Date": "December 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire", "Author": "scarecrow \"scarecrow\"", "ReviewID": "R3UW3A3IZ7QQK5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I hardly ever write reviews but there are so many strange reviews out there I felt I should.  I have had my Fire for almost a month, it is my 3rd Android Tablet and I am very happy with it.  Tablets including the iPad are basically toys for adults despite the available business apps.  People do use them for business but usually they have to add a keyboard and then you have something that does not fully function as a laptop but is also no longer easily carried.  There are apps for the Fire which allow you to read business email, read and edit documents but you can also do that on your phone.  The Kindle Fire, costs $199, and is clearly advertized as a media consumption device.  As such it works perfectly, I have had no problems watching videos, listening to music, surfing the net, reading email or playing games.  I even use it to read books occasionally but as I have a regular Kindle I tend to use that more often because then I am not tempted to stop reading and start playing games.  I don't find it too heavy and have no problem with the screen size.  Everything I do on the Fire I can also do on my Android phone but it is nice to have the bigger screen.  My previous Android tablets were 10 inch and I found them too heavy to carry round with me all day so I rarely used them. Reading through some of the bad reviews it is clear that most of the dissatisfied customers didn't read the specs before buying.

I received my Fire back in November, and I love it. I have had no issues with the Wi-Fi or response time - it is just as quick to respond as my Mac laptop that is on the same home network. I don't have a problem erroneously turning the system off, and, even if I did accidentally hit the power button (which I don't), you are asked to confirm that you want to shutdown; it doesn't just turn off. The only issue I have occasionally experienced is difficulty hitting a particular link if it is right next to others, but there's an easy fix: just zoom in on the page, which you can do easily by the standard finger movement of pinching your index finger and thumb on the touchscreen and then separating them, and then the links are big enough to easily select. Perhaps the media reviewers are giving such poor reviews because they are comparing it to an iPad, but this is not an iPad nor has Amazon claimed that it is... If you want an iPad, spend the extra $300 and get one. But if you want an excellent Kindle that has all of the features advertised by Amazon, the Fire is a perfect product.To know if my review is relevant to your decision, you should know how I use my Fire.

I received his Kindle about 2 weeks ago and he asked for me to download some books and games onto it for him before I mailed it off. Right away I was amazed at what this thing could do. The vivid display and the touch screen are what I noticed at first. The colors are so bright, the display so detailed and the touch screen has the perfect sensitivity to it. Next thing I noticed about it was its convenient size. Its not too big nor is it too small. Its thicker than an iPad but it fits a lot better in your hand. I have no problem holding it in one hand and typing with the other at all and I have relatively small hands. Tried out the Netflix app and the picture is super clear.

This however can do pretty much everything I need it to. Facebook, email, web browsing, video, games, music and of course BOOKS! I needed something to put a library of books on for when I leave for my own deployment next year so I could save room in my locker from so many books as well as save my wallet from a heart attack.

Buffington", "ReviewID": "R1MYD3KAUL1SGJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Kindle Fire is a very impressive device, and for the money it is an incredible bargain in my estimation.  No, it is not an iPad and it is not intended to be a substitute for one.  What it is is a very nice way to access Amazon content with a very attractive screen and a decent sound capability.  The screen is beautiful, and looks very much like a small iPad.  It is simply amazing that a device with a 7\" screen of this quality is available at this price. The Fire is minimalist, with very few physical controls or ports.  On the bottom is a micro-USB port that does double duty as the charger port and computer access port. (By the way, the late-model conventional Kindle mini-USB charger works fine with the Fire.  Nice!) There is an on-off switch which doubles as a charging indicator (amber for charging, green for charged). There is a headphone jack.  There are two small speakers at the top of the unit.  And that's it.  This minimalist approach obviously lets Amazon keep the price of the unit down, and most controls are accessed via the touchscreen.  It works, within its limitations.As a book reader the Fire is very nice in the shade or indoors.  Like all backlit devices there will be problems in direct sunlight and the e-paper type of Kindle will be better for days at the beach and whatnot.  But the touchscreen feature, enabling page-tuning with the flick of a finger makes for a very nice reading experience in environments other than in bright sunlight.  I personally like backlit screens better than e-paper when reading indoors and I have quickly taken to my Kindle Fire as my main indoor reader.  And of course when reading in bed after lights-out the Fire is perfect.  I have always liked the 7\" screen size for e-readers and I find that the Fire is a real pleasure for its main use-as an e-reader.For streaming movies from Amazon the Fire makes for a nice experience.  It has external speakers but many users will benefit from external headphones -- there is a headphone jack on the bottom of the unit.  The Fire features only 8GB of DRAM and is not really intended to hold many movies or other content.  Amazon designed the device primarily for streaming movie content directly from Amazon via Wi Fi.  My middling-fast home Wi Fi network does this fine, and I suspect that many users will like using the Fire to simply rent movies off Amazon rather than buy.  The unit's mini-USB port (which does double duty as a charging port) will allow the user to move video content, songs, etc. from one's computer to the Fire.  This highlights an important characteristic of the Fire: it really requires a Wi Fi connection to do most of what it is designed to do.  It will hold a lot of books, but if you wish to stream video or access the web, you need to have access to a wireless network.  For most of us this is not a problem most of the time.  WiFi networks are becoming ubiquitous.FREE STUFF:  Every Kindle Fire owner is going to want to be an Amazon Prime member.  Incredibly, there are a huge amount of TV series and movies and other goodies that Amazon Prime members can stream FOR FREE to their Kindle Fires.  This is such an amazing bargain that this capability alone justifies the purchase of a Kindle Fire and an Amazon Prime membership for practically anyone.One feature that the Kindle Fire really brings to the table is the ability to browse the Web.  The older Kindles were really not much good for this because they lacked touchscreen capability and the ability to \"pinch\" the display to the necessary resolution.  The Fire does allow this and comes equipped with a pretty good browser: Amazon \"Silk.\"  I find that the Fire does very well as a portable web browser and the screen, being better than that on my iPhone, makes it a very nice portable device for web browsing when I do not want to carry my iPad2 and when I nonetheless have WiFi access.  Expect to see lots of Kindle Fires in Starbucks and places like that.Email: The Kindle Fire is great for email when using web-based email such as Gmail or Yahoo.  I happen to have a custom Gmail domain name, and I was not able to set it up on the email app that ships with the Fire.  Happily, there is an app \"enhanced email\" that worked fine with this.  You will need to alter the default settings as follows for a custom domain Gmail account: Username (full email address), IMAP Server [...] Security type: SSL, SMTP server [...], Security Type \"TLS\". [These are universal settings but for some reason Amazon deleted them from this review.  Google \"Setting up Gmail with custom domain name\" and you'll find them.] These settings worked for me on the enhanced email app and now my fire is an excellent portable email device!Apps--Amazon obviously intends for the Fire to be an engine for running applications of all types, and there are already lots of apps available, many for free, or for just a buck or two.  Everyone is going to use it for Netflix, weather reports, sports scores, and many of the other things that the iPad also does so well.  What the Fire will probably not do for most users is serve as a paperless notepad the way the iPad does.  The iPad with an external keyboard and its larger screen is obviously better for this.  On the other hand, the Fire is great for reading documents and you can email Word, PDF, and certain other formats directly to the Fire.  While the iPad is better for this, the Fire is quite serviceable as a document reader.The Cloud -- the one thing that the Fire really does is exploit the Cloud.  You can access your Amazon content any time anywhere there is WiFi.  The Cloud is rapidly becoming one of the distinguishing technological features of the early 21st Century, and the Fire exploits it very well.  For me personally, the Fire motivates me to buy more Amazon video content for just this reason.  The ability to access my Amazon content when on the road or just loafing in the backyard within WiFi access is irresistible.Here is an interesting question: could or will someone write an App that would enable the Kindle Fire to be an iTunes authorized device, thereby allowing it to stream iTunes content?  The iPad has a Kindle app, after all.  Guess we will have to stay tuned.The Fire is not a substitute for an iPad for many things.  But it is a wonderful e-reader, a very nice portable videodevice, a good portable web browser, and more besides.  I cannot say it enough times: for the money the Kindle Fire is an amazing value.  It is a gorgeous, multipurpose device that is sure to please.  Recommended without reservation.

So, having read some of the reviews i was concerned about my purchase.  Maybe I should have only ordered a Kindle e-reader - after all, I probably couldn't figure the Fire out.  Wrong!  Got it yesterday afternoon and only wish I was home today to play more with it.  I had not trouble getting started - once I figured out my WI-FI password, it was easy.  I won't pretend to have mastered all the features, but I did already hook up my e-mail, configure the weather app, and browse around.  I am a Prime member, so have already borrowed a book and started reading.  I have no problem with the visual display or the sound, and also no issue with the keypad.  I find it easy to turn pages.  Maybe my expectations were lower than others - I have never had an I-pad because of price, so I can't make comparisons.

Also 2) You do get a free month on amazon prime which is great but afterwards im not sure its worth the $79/yr.

As an iPad owner it was not something I was interested in, but now I have one I am.The first thing I would say is that I am an Amazon fan so for me it is great for entertainment. This is not and was not meant to be an iPad replacement, there is an excellent review on amazon that also states this. I have put a matt screen protector on it so I can read books. I also own a Kindle Touch, you cannot beat the basic kindles for reading books they are awesome. So if that is all you want to do I recommend the Kindle Touch 3G with the cover with the light in it.The Fire is fun, it is really just for entertainment and a great way for Amazon to deliver its content to the consumer fast. For the price it is excellent. I think this is a great tablet for kids, as there is no camera therefore no capability for video connections with ( for want of better words) undesirable individuals. If you have Amazon Prime - free streaming movies! There are some productivity apps but I think the iPad excels in this department.So in a nutshell if you just want to read, listen to music, watch movies and Facebook etc but not Skype and are on a budget this is the tablet for you. I would recommend adding a Matt screen protector and search amazon for a nice cover that will also act as a stand for when watching movies, there are great covers for under $15. Also a Stylus can be handy and you should not be paying over $2 per stylus. They wear out and on the whole the cheap ones are fine, but that is just my opinion.Hope this review is helpful, but remember it is just my opinion.", "Date": "May 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Tablet Under $200", "Author": "David Cripe", "ReviewID": "R1VC0JNJUN19WU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love my Kindle Fire!  I had reservations concerning its price point and usefulness, but it does the job beautifully!  Excellent job for the first version of a new product.  I will just come out and say it:  This is no iPad.  The iPad is faster, bigger, and sleek looking compared to the Kindle Fire.  Plus it has the integration of Apple products behind it (iTunes, etc).  Not that any of these features are better in my opinion.  I actually prefer the smaller size of the Fire tablet.  The iPad is just too big to lug around everywhere, and I would just rather carry a laptop instead of the iPad.  The Fire is just the right size for most people.  I carry it around often without thinking how 'big' it is.The price of the Kindle Fire is the huge selling point that is worthy of the praise.  The iPad is way too expensive for its limited usefulness.  You can buy two Kindle Fires for the price of 1 older iPad.  I mainly use the Fire for an eReader with occasional stops at games, movies, and web use.  If you are considering a plain Kindle vs Fire, just get the Fire.  The battery lasts a very long time, even more than I had hoped.  I use it around 2 hours each day on average and it needs charging once a week.  If you spend hours upon hours a day using the Fire, then it will need charged daily.Reading on the Fire is excellent and better than a regular Kindle.  The page turns are smooth and no need for an outer source of light.  The Fire also feels more like a book compared to a regular Kindle.  The touch screen is very user friendly and you can certainly do more on it.  Another plus is that you get an 'Ad-free' version of the Kindle at this price point, which is not much more than a kindle touch that is ad-free.  Huge bonus for the Fire:  It is in color!As for the other functions: games are fun, apps work like the Apple versions, web browsing is useful although not user friendly for long term surfing, touch keyboard is responsive and quick, plus it is fast to come out of standby mode.  Not to mention that everything is connected to the best store in the world:  Amazon!The few 'negatives' I have concerning the Fire is this:  It has a sluggishness feel navigating between items and features (probably due to lower price and slower hardware), the charger does not separate the plug from the USB cord like most new cell phones so you need a separate USB cord to hook up to a computer, can feel warm to the touch after using the Fire for more than 30 minutes at a time, not able to customize in terms of different backgrounds and looks, and it takes a rather 'long' time to power up from being turned off (around 30 seconds or so).  Many people complain that the power button on the bottom is easy to hit, but I never found that to to be a problem.  I would prefer it to be on top though like most handheld devices.  Also you will need a screen protector and case to protect your purchase.Overall, the Kindle Fire is the best tablet hands-down.  The iPad is a better piece of technology, but it is like a Rolls Royce - too expensive for the function it was intended.  Throw in the price, usefulness, and backing of Amazon to get a clear winner in the tablet wars.

You like the way it feels in your hands when you're reading.  You like the act of turning the pages.  You take great delight in closing the book and putting it down when you're all finished.  Yes, I was the same way!  How on earth was I going to get that same feeling from an e-reader???  Believe it or not, I do.  So much so that I \"paid it forward\" and purchased one for MY mother for her birthday.I am sure I got my love of books from her.  She has read a hundred times the books I have and, therefore, didn't think that she was going to like it as much.  Yet, when we sat down together at the computer to place the order, she got SO excited knowing it was coming.  The day it arrived she called to tell me of all the books she had already found for FREE!!!  She carries it with her everywhere she goes (as do I) and calls me frequently to tell me of new finds!But why the Kindle Fire and not just any e-reader?

The Fire has allowed me to gradually learn how to use my fingers to type on screen (yes, for you ladies with fingernails, it can be done).  I can access my email and all the websites I need in order to work where ever there's internet access which, for the most part is EVERY WHERE!

A few apps, an alternative market has unleashed a whole other side of this  little gem. Had this tablet been out last June I might not also own a Galaxy Tab 10.1 because other than screen size, the Fire could be a nice replacement,  for my uses, and it blows my ipads walled garden world away.

I like the iPad better than the Fire only for 2 reasons: browsing the web (the screen is bigger - I can see stuff better & don't have to scroll around as much), & there are so many more Apple-compatible aftermarket accessories available (like boomboxes, alarm clocks, device to TV cables, etc). The compatibility of Apple products to aftermarket devices is the only reason I have an iPhone 4 rather than an Android phone. Other than that, give me the Fire. For watching movies, reading books, anything for entertainment, I like the smaller size of the Kindle. With the Fire, I don't have all the restrictions Apple puts on the iPad (like no Flash Player which prevents me from watching my Amazon Prime videos, DRM restrictions on music & video files, & on and on). I hate iTunes that's required with the iPad & iPhone. It takes over & controls everything on my Apple devices & PC. Not so with the Fire, thank goodness. Coordination with the Kindle & Amazon's website is easy, user friendly & decisions about stuff are made by the user, not by Apple. It was so cool when I first bought my Fire that it linked automatically to my Amazon Prime account. Corny, but I truly felt like a \"member\". Common complaints about the Fire (such as no volume buttons, limited storage, etc.) are well-documented, so I won't go into them. But for only $199, I have no regrets in my purchase. I love this thing. If Amazon comes out with a new & improved Kindle Fire (whether bigger, twice the price, or whatever), I'll purchase one.

I struggled with buying the Kindle Fire since it first came out.  I have been reading reviews, weighing the pros and cons, and trying to tell myself to just be happy with what I have and not get it.  I'm an impulse buyer so for me to wait 3 months and finally purchase it... that is a REALLY big deal for me.I give 5 stars for my Kindle Fire.  I love so many things about it.  First of all, I'm already a Android user.  I've had a droid phone for 2 1/2 years now, so I'm already familiar with a lot of the apps and the settings.  So far, I have watched a movie, played with (and used) some apps, read some books, listened to music (my MP3 Amazon music and Pandora), surfed the Web, been to Facebook, used the email feature, viewed my Google Documents, and sent some new documents to my device using the \"Send To Kindle PC Installer through Amazon.\"Things I really like... in no particular order:1.  Seeing the cover of my books2.  The ease of adding, removing, and rearranging items on my Favorites3.  Being able to remove items from my Carousel... but it doesn't remove them from my device4.  How quick books are downloaded5.  The ease of surfing the Web6.  How fast my device works in normal applications7.  The ease of watching a movie8.  The sound of the device with my headphones9.  The size of the keyboard10.  The fact that the screen changes in all 4 directions by just turning it... so I can hold it anyway I want to.  I just move it and tap the device at the top and it switches position quickly11.  The background choices.  (it took me a while to find this... it's under the \"Font\" section).  I use the black at night, sepia in the am, and white in the light of day... I use all 3 and like them all12.  How easy it is to change the brightness, volume, and turning on and off the wi-fi13.  That I can download my already purchased music and movies to listen and or watch on my device14.  If I run out of space, I have all my books, music and videos stored on Amazon's Cloud to watch from my device (wi-fi) enabled15.  How easy it is to zoom in and out16.  That I haven't had any trouble on the Web.  I've gone anywhere I've wanted to and been able to anything I want to.17.  That I can read Adobe EPUB eBooks borrowed, from my local library, (they have a bigger selection than Kindle books at this point).  I can download them onto my Kindle Fire so I no longer have to read them on my computer only18.  That I can listen to my Pandora while reading a book19.  How easy the bookmark feature is to use.  Most importantly... it's way easier to Delete a bookmark from a book on the KF than any of the other Kindles I've used20.  How easy it use to change pages21.  That some books allow you to click on the Chapter at the top to switch between chapters22.  That there is a tag on the covers of the book to give you a percentage of how much you've read23.  That the device is backlit so I don't have to clip on my book light when I read at night24.  The Glare hasn't really bothered me like some people have complained... I just adjust the tilt of the device and the brightness to suit me.  I'm able to read outside just fine25.  That there is a black border around the edge so I can place my fingers on the edges while holding it on all 4 sides without worry oftouching the pages26.  How easy it is to sync books between devices27.  That I have easy access to my documents28.  That I purchased the 2 year warranty for pretty cheap... so I have the peace of mind that it's covered if anything happens to itI've read a lot of reviews where people complained that they didn't really enjoy using it to read books.  So, I thought I'd buy it and use it for everything else and my Kindle Keyboard for reading.  But, now that I have it, I actually like reading books on it better than my other device... which really surprised me.  I plan to carry my KK with me when I'm out and about, and using my KF while at home.  Although, when I go on vacation, I plan to take both!The only strange thing is that all my other chargers won't charge my Kindle Fire.  My USB will connect to my computer, but it doesn't charge.  The only charger that charges in the one that came in the box.  So, I'll have to take good care of that one, and make sure I take it with me when I'm on vacation.

The Kindle Fire is not trying to reach the same market that is interested in the IPAD.  It's obvious that they are taking the approach of \"What improvements can we make to our current e-reader to allow us to distribute more of our digital services to the consumer and add some additional functionality allowing people to do more with their e-reader when they are on the go so they don't need to take a billion devices with them?\" It is easy to setup this device and make purchases.  It has a basic web browser and you can download and install a number of free apps including Netflix (you still have to be a Netflix member), Pandora, etc.  You can also download apps like Angry Birds, Peggle, a Calculator, etc.  There are a number of free books that you can read on your Kindle and if you are an Amazon Prime member there are a number of tv shows and movies that you can watch for free on your Kindle.  Of course you can also rent or buy videos.  It is nice that a lot of the content you purchase through Amazon can be stored to the cloud for free.  Having messed around with this I was quite impressed it.  There is little to no customization but the user interface is simple and effective.  Would I give up my IPAD for it?  No, that is just silly, but my wife loves it and if I couldn't afford an IPAD this is a pretty good poor man's substitute.  I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a tablet at a very affordable price.

All that could be said has already been said and I do not think if I can add much to it. However, I will try to present my view.I have been using this tablet for the past 3 weeks and it also includes two long flight journeys. I find the 7\" a little lacking, not much but just a little. That said I would happily take a 7\" than 10\". The screen is wonderful. Pictures, movies, text, etc display wonderfully well. I am a prime subscriber and it was one the motivational factors to buy this tablet. During the flights I finished reading two books. The reading experience was fine and as good as any LCD screen experience. As usual with kindle the font, line spacing and margin options made reading a reasonably good experience. Movie watching was very good indeed and I was impressed with the screen quality, smooth videos and a reasonably good sound output from the speakers.I installed a few applications and side loaded a few popular free ones that I use regularly on the phone. It pulled my corporate email fine and replying to emails was less cumbersome than on the phone (obviously). The browser was fine and as noted in the several review sites its performance is nothing to brag about. I downloaded Opera mobile from Opera website and it made a huge difference in performance. I now use Opera almost exclusively on the Fire.The interface is simple, clean and easy to use. The carousel is a good idea although annoying at many times. The could have just provided some widgets and favorites in the home screen rather than the carousel. The tablet is surely a little heavy for 7 inches. I found my wrist aching after a little while. A Samsung galaxy tab 7 feels quite a bit lighter. Lack of any kind of physical buttons, apart from power, is a little annoying at times. I would have preferred volume buttons at least. The design is simple and boring but I can live with it.As shown by iFixit this thing has bluetooth built in, however, I am not sure if it has a bluetooth antenna. They should have just enabled it. It would help in file transfers and wireless audio streaming to a stereo. If I have to nit pick I would have gladly paid $250 for this if it included 1GB RAM, 16GB storage, bluetooth, and a simple camera (i know this device does not require a camera), and a SD card slot.All said and done I love this tablet and I look forward to using it to the fullest.", "Date": "December 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good tablet made great by the priice", "Author": "JLM", "ReviewID": "R264GXD7W6KQ2K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Given that there are over 4,000 reviews as I write this one I'll use this post just to identify some thing I hope Amazon will address in the next version. First of all, the carousel is just a stupid idea; it should be bagged. The home screen s/b given over to the favorites section so whatever is used regularly can be pinned there and then be easily available without having to scroll down to reveal the second and third rows of the favorites. Between the favorites on the home screen and the easy access to the main categories the carousel serves no useful purpose and takes up way to much screen. Second, give us a second warning between the 15% battery remaining message and automatic device shutdown. Third, syncing could be improved. right now, when the Fire is turned on it tries and fails to sync even as it is still attempting to resurrect the wifi connection, forcing s manual sync after the connection is made. Better pacing is called for. Fourth, when the primary activity of the user is reading, the battery should last longer than 6 hours. I know I'm spoiled by the battery length on the 2nd generation Kindle, but the Fire isn't as fully functional as it should be to have to charge the Fire overnight then again mid-day if the plan is to spend Sunday reading the Sunday paper and a good book on the Fire. And fifth, the Owners Lending Library is a great idea, but it needs to be beefed up with more widely read titles. Right now, there are too few titles I've even heard of, and the ones I've heard of I've probably already read. Most of the available titles wouldn't make my primary or secondary reading lists. So far, being limited to one title a month is not a burden; I'm still looking for a title to read in my second month.Lest anyone think my comments don't reflect my rating, I do like this device and am happy I purchased it. My desire was a portable device on which I could read books, newspapers and magazines, manage my emails, and surf the web. I can do all these things well. The 7 inch screen is large enough for me. My wife has the iPad 2, which I've used a lot. For the way I use a tablet, spending $200 instead of $500 is a no brainer.

I'm still getting used to the fact I have a tablet and don't have to do everything that I used to do on the phone on the phone but on the tablet.  However, it is only wi-fi, and I knew that going into it, though I do wish it had the 3g option, like certain versions of the iPad.  Will it be a true iPad killer, only time will tell, but so far the numbers have put it at a good strong second, 20% of the public say they'll buy a Fire, though still 65% say they'll buy an iPad.  The price is the major point, but also that it is from Amazon, a company that we trust to deliver on what they say.  I am looking forward to some company coming out with an attachable keyboard, if it is possible.  I'll comment more when I have had more time to delve into all that the Fire can do.  So far, I love it and, it is not an iPad, but it is definitely a great product that I'm looking forward to seeing where Amazon goes with this.  With such a solid base for products, the Prime membership, the Amazon cloud for music storage, the app store with great support, and of course that wonderful book selection, and excellent screen resolution, how could you go wrong.  I have watched a couple of movies on it and the battery life is great, it only moved 10% or less of the battery for one movie because it only uses wi-fi.  I have a Kindle 2 3g and I love reading on it, and with the Fire I was concerned about the screen being lighted versus the e-ink.  Amazon definitely has done their homework and my eyes are not fatigued as much as I thought they might be.  I do tire a little quicker when reading for extended periods of time with the Fire when compared to the regular Kindle, hours at at time for me.  I do admit that I was concerned with the screen size for watching movies, but it is fine.  My eyes were not tired at all at the end of a 2 hour movie and the sound coming from the headphones was great.  I am glad that Netflix was able to get an app for it as well as many of the apps that I already had on my android phone.  I do recommend this to anyone who would like to have a tablet computer that will fit in one hand and have a great backing of a strong company.

I have a Kindle 3 and I love it, and I trusted Amazon to make the Kindle Fire a great experience.  Unfortunately, because of the following reasons, I'm returning it to Amazon:* No physical volume button* Extremely audible hiss from the headphone jack -- I use high quality headphones but the hiss even at very low volume really distracts from the experience* Videos look mediocre to bad -- I looked at many videos I know are HD on both YouTube and Netflix.  On the Fire they look low-res and often pixelated.  Both YouTube and Netflix look WAY better on my iPhone 3GS, and that's simply unacceptable to me.  It's also not because the 3GS has a smaller screen.  I've seen these HD videos displayed beautifully on iPads.  Both the Fire and the 3GS were connected to the same wireless network.* Bad email client -- I've used many Android phones that all have better email clients than the Fire, because they use the client that comes with Android rather than some Amazon-made client.* No calendar client -- I'd like to enter my Gmail credentials and have email, contacts, calendar all work seamlessly.  Shouldn't be too much to ask for.* Non-standard browser - Silk really falls short.  It might appear okay at first, but Amazon is trying to solve a problem that didn't exist.  The native Android browser is standards-compliant and so much better, and Amazon should've just used that.  For example, clicks sometimes have unresponsive behavior.  Also, Silk is not \"location aware.\"  There are some websites, such as Google Maps, that use your current location.  Foursquare also does it, and I'd like to have the option of sharing my location with the site, but the Silk can't do it.  We really don't need another browser and I guarantee you there will be more problems people will discover with Silk.* Appstore is lacking:  Some of the popular apps, such as YouTube and Facebook, simply point to a website.  Android apps for them exist, just not on Amazon.  If you come from iOS or an Android device that has access to the open market, get ready to be EXTREMELY disappointed by the app selection.* Gets \"stuck\" very often -- lastly, the Fire gets unresponsive quite often and makes the experience very jarring at times.  Ask yourself this, \"Am I willing to deal with having to tap the screen 5 times to get something done?\"I'm so sad to say that the Kindle doesn't do anything better than my old combination of iPhone 3GS + Kindle 3.

Now, with full disclosure in mind, most of my friends know I'm not too keen on Apple, which is a bias I have developed due to my ire for iTunes. I'd guess I'm not the only person in this digital age that can say, \"I like my iPod Touch just fine but I loathe iTunes.\" The thing about Apple that really bugs me is that iTunes is proprietary. If you want to download and manage content, you have to do it through iTunes, period. And, I simply find iTunes a bloated, annoying nightmare. Having been up front about this, I am admitting that the iPad tablet is the standard by which all others aspire to. I get it, and I concede the point. But, I will not own one because I refuse to be tethered to iTunes, not ever again. (Please, hold back on the vitriolic feedback from those who can't imagine someone not supporting the great Apple. It's not a personal attack on you.)Kindling ...So, moving on, I resolved that all other products were fair game. I looked at, researched, Googled, and generally poured over just about every other tablet, including e-readers, until my head nearly exploded. Back and forth, comparing specs, reading reviews ... ugh. Then one day, I just had a moment of impetuousness and ordered a Kindle Fire. Right up until the day before I clicked \"Place Order\", I still had no definitive idea what to do. I reckon, in a moment of clarity, I realized the answers to a simple question ... \"What are you going to use it for most?\"The answers in order were 1) reading books and magazines, 2) streaming video, 3) minimal amounts browsing, email and social networking, and, 4) listening to music.Full disclosure in mind, part deux: I'm already an Amazon Prime subscriber, an avid online consumer and a big fan of Amazon. Big. My annual $79 Prime membership easily pays for itself in shipping and convenience and, although the content doesn't match Netflix, Prime does include many thousands of movies and TV shows which can be streamed \"for free\". I stream a good deal of content under the umbrella of my Prime membership already, and I love it.Early on in my research, someone suggested the Kindle Fire but, after looking at it with a full blown tablet in mind, I dismissed it because it was comparatively slim on internal memory (8GB) and wasn't 3G. (It's Wi-Fi only.) I quickly said \"Meh\" ... and moved on. But, someone had said in a review that at $199, the Kindle Fire was almost an impulse buy at its low price, and that is certainly true. In fact, an iPad cost substantially more than twice that and so do a lot of other full blown tabs. A tweaked out iPad ... three times as much. You can get a decent lap top for that kind of scratch!My wife has owned a first generation Nook for over a year now and she loves it and reads on it every day. Nice size, and in a nice case, kind of sexy. (Also true for the wife, I might add.) I narrowed it down to wanting a 7\" device pretty easily. Although, I really didn't consider the Nook Color because as a Prime member ... well, why would I? Prime has its Kindle benefits, too.Yes, well, so I pulled the trigger on a Fire, and here's my blather on the \"points of interest\".Addressing My Own Criteria First ...As An e-Reader - Fabulous. At my age, it's wonderful to be able to size the font to my own needs. And, although it's not as \"booky\" as e-ink (like the display on my wife's Nook), you do have options of black on white, white on black, or my favorite, brown on tan. With the brightness toned back, it's very easy on the eyes during long reads. Also unlike her Nook, you can read in portrait or landscape orientation, and of course, it will self-adjust accordingly. It comes loaded with a comprehensive Oxford Dictionary which offers a really wonderful service; see a word you aren't familiar with and you can long touch the word which will immediately bring up the dictionary entry of it. Now that's something you can't do with paper.Images look rich because the screen is backlit and uses \"in plane switching\" (IPS) technology, the same technology that my best monitor offers, the one I use for professional photo editing. This means it looks great at almost any angle of view.Magazines look fabulous, too. The Fire offers a PAGE view and a TEXT view. In page, you see the entire original magazine page, and you can pinch to zoom in, but on a 7\" screen, it's not really very practical. In text, you get to bypass all the ads, still see the images in the articles, and adjust your font to taste. Hit the \"like\" button for me. That's a terrific feature.The Fire is fairly heavy in the hand, heavier than the wife's Nook, but I just am not bothered by that. I parked it in a RooCASE Dual View Multi-angle Leather Folio Case Cover ($25) which easily allows you to prop the device up in either orientation. It acts equally well as a stand or for lap support and it looks and feels great in addition to being protective.No buttons to turn pages. You just touch the right or left edge of the screen, or sweep a finger across it in whichever direction you want to go. One friend told me, \"Yeah, sorry, I like paper.\" That's fine, and I get it. Old habits die hard. As for me, the thing I most dislike about books is having to hold the damn book open (e.g. ... a thick paperback) which, as you get older, becomes more tiring on the evermore arthritic hands. Further, real books certainly do look great on a shelf, where they gather dust, and take up space ... a lot of space if you are a real an addict.As A Personal Streaming Video Player - Fabulous.  Wi-Fi required. (Of course, you can store movies on the device, but that's a little silly. Six or so movies would eat up your onboard storage. But, if you do that, you could view them without Wi-Fi.) The aforementioned IPS technology makes for a beautiful visual experience. The player buffers quickly and streams super smoothly with no glitching, at least on my home Wi-Fi network and everywhere else I've used it. The LCD screen is bright enough that I actually like to dial the brightness back substantially (which also extends battery life). One could listen to the little built-in speakers for audio, but in this age of ear buds, I'm not sure why you would unless it was your only choice.  The standard 3.5mm stereo audio output will take any headphone with a compatible male jack, or could just as easily be run to your home stereo amplifier and listened to on the \"big system\" with little more than a trip to Radio Shack (or Amazon) for the right cable / adapters and an available auxiliary input on your home stereo system.I've watched everything from vintage Rocky And Bullwinkle to Joss Whedon's Dollhouse while sitting comfortably at my desk, in my big leather office chair, audio connected to my head courtesy of Bose headphones, even whilst sipping a wee dram of Irish whiskey ... and it all looks great. Needless to say, it interfaces seamlessly with Amazon Prime Instant Video, but YouTube is just as stable.As A Browser / Email Utility - Great. Wi-Fi required. Amazon Silk, the browser that comes with the Fire is fast and smooth and easy on the eye. I like it very much. As for email, I was able to configure it for my Google Gmail account in about five seconds flat. To be fair, while it's nice to be able to check your email and respond and have all your contacts on board and all that, I really don't much care about it. Sometimes I just don't want to be reached, and while using it as a reader or video player I'd prefer to escape the world and its immediate connectivity. So goes it with Facebook and similar networking, too. Although the app and interface for Facebook on the Fire is quite nice, it isn't a deal maker for me. I already have a 3G phone that does all that. (I pay a minimum fee of $30 a month for 5GB of \"data\" access on my Droid, and use about a tenth of a gig, which tells you how much I want to be browsing and emailing when I'm not in my office or my home workstation.)As A Music Player - Great. Wi-Fi not required to access files on the device, but is required to use Pandora or similar cloud based services. You can listen to music while reading if you so choose. Again, the built-in speakers are adequate, but don't expect mind-blowing bass response. In fact, except for the lack of substantial volume, (it is, after all, a  \"personal space\" device) it sounds every bit as good or better than the first CD boombox I ever heard, which was a hell of a step up from a cassette tape boombox. Anyone remember those? Of course, headphones, earbuds, or output to an external stereo system would be a preferable audio experience.More To Consider ...Charging - You can use the device normally while charging with the supplied AC charger, but not while connected to a computer via USB where is it being recognized as a storage device, even though it is charging while connected there. I really appreciate being able to use it while charging; both places where I read most often, my desk and my recliner, are AC outlet friendly. Incidentally, it does NOT ship with a USB 2.0 / micro B connector cable, but if you have a smart phone, you probably already have one.Internal Memory - Yes, 8 gigs (under 7 after the space the OS hogs) is small by today's standards. Amazon is banking on the cloud, and giving away 5GB of cloud storage right out of the gate. Additional space is dirt cheap if you need more. The Fire offers two side by side, on- screen buttons: CLOUD and DEVICE. You can choose content from either when in wireless range. You can easily manage your content, swapping stuff to and fro using your Amazon account (It's the Manage Your Kindle link). But, this is NOT iTunes, baby. You can also manage and back up content by plugging your Fire into your computer via USB and dragging and dropping into and out of folders at will. Take that, iPad. That was a big one for me.Yes, I know ... we've become digital collectors. More is gooder. Our devices have become our digital junk rooms. Some of you have 240 GB of space on your music players and feel compelled to carry 20,000 mp3 files around with you everywhere you go.  Book addicts, I ask you, are you going to have to carry 10,000 books on your device? I mean, after you've totally enjoyed Cold Mountain, do you really need to carry it with you as if at any moment you might need to suddenly reread it on impulse?  In my own case, I lean more toward non-fiction which includes a good deal of \"how to\" content, some of it reference material. Even at that, I couldn't imagine myself needing to carry thousands of books with me. Realistically, even on a long vacation where Wi-Fi wasn't available, I think 6+GB of storage would provide all the space I would need to read and enjoy some music. All I would have to do would be to prepare for the trip by managing the content I intended to take along.Whispernet - The Kindle Fire uses Whispernet to sync all your compatible devices.[sic] ... \"Whispernet is accessible without any monthly fee or wireless subscription, although fees can be incurred for the delivery of periodicals and other content when roaming internationally beyond the customer's home country. Through a service called \"Whispersync,\" customers can synchronize reading progress, bookmarks and other information across Kindle hardware devices and other mobile devices.\"  -- WikipediaWhat's that mean? Well, even if you don't have a Kindle, Amazon has developed software for a broad variety of platforms including Windows, Mac, iOS, Blackberry, Android and so on. For instance, I had Kindle For PC on my home computer, even before ordering my Fire, for reading a few free books. Whispersync sees to it that when I quit reading on one device I will be able to open and continue reading at the same spot on any other device.  Pretty smooth.Common Complaints - Having read through a great many reviews and message boards about the Kindle Fire before (and moreso after) I purchased one, I saw a some recurring beefs from consumers, both Kindle Owners and non-owners in the Anti-Kindle camp. My thoughts and observations:Clunky Interface ... Some complain that the interface itself is sort of awkward and \"clunky\". The main carousel stores your recently accessed content using large icons in the chronological order you accessed them. (You sweep through the icons the same way you sweep through your albums on an iPod Touch or iPhone.) Customer feedback has been serious enough about the lack of customization that at the time of this writing, Amazon has already announced that in a few weeks a seamless, wireless upgrade via Whispernet will be uploaded to everyone's Fire.  Most of you, if buying a Fire in the future, will never know the original issue existed, if it was a problem at all. Also, this announcement from Amazon is good news to me, as I know that they will continue to make improvements to the OS and interface and upload upgrades automatically. It will just keep getting' better. (UPDATE: Just hours after uploading my review the aforementioned upgrade was delivered and, praise glory, you now have the option upon long touching an item in the carousel to \"remove from carousel\". This allows for us to really clean up the carousel and customize it to our liking.)Not Responsive Enough ... This is, in my opinion, quite true. There are moments when you tap and nothing happens, and you must tap again, and again. The device seems \"selectively problematic\". I find no troubles while reading books, scrolling page to next page. The carousel can be troublesome, sometimes reluctant to lock onto an icon. Double tapping is often ineffective, requiring subsequent taps and faster or slower intervals, or harder pressure to be effective. I have considered the possibility that I just have to get used to the feel of it, but it's been a while now, and I'm still noticing the problem.My most frustrating moments come with \"graphic novels\". The Fire is touted as offering an amazing experience with comics, and comes with an app for reading them. There are many fine comics available, including free content ... and so, as a fellow who was once a kid who loved comics, I downloaded a half dozen or so free titles. Once I got the feel for navigating ... (double tapping the first frame of a page zooms in and then sweeping left advances you to the next frame, a wonderful concept in theory) the experience began to improve. However, the double tapping at the beginning of each page was simply terrible with regard to sensitivity, just awful. That kind of frustration simply kills one's immersion in the story and swaps it out for higher blood pressure.I'm not sure whether this is an app issue, an OS issue or a hardware issue. All I know is it's probably my one serious complaint about the device. Again, the previously stated, newest upgrade is said to include an improved responsiveness. I sincerely hope that is true.Smallish Keyboard ... I'm inclined to agree; I'd like to see the pop-up, on-screen keyboard have larger keys. It still feels cramped to me, and on a 7\" screen, I can't imagine a reason not to utilize the majority of the space.Wi-Fi Only ... Just speaking for myself, I don't need 3G or 4G to read books. I have a Droid phone for all the other stuff. In my case, why spend extra money for that?Too Few Apps ... While it's true that there are not yet a huge number of apps for the Fire, I'm not too concerned about it. I found a free note pad utility and some other small things that seemed useful, and I'm not a gamer at all.  There is a toggle in SETTINGS to allow installation of apps from unknown sources, but I haven't been too eager to fill the device with stuff I probably won't use anyway.No Camera or Microphone ... I have a Droid phone for that. And, at $199, I don't think you can whine too awful much.No USB 2.0/3.0, HDMI, or Other Outputs ... All true. And, at $199, I don't think you can whine too awful much.All That \"Amazon Stuff\" ... I showed my new Fire to a friend while in the company of a young, computer techie stranger, and I mentioned it was not a full blown tablet. The young fellow rolled his eyes in disgust and made it clear that, in his expert opinion, it was a completely inferior device and waste of money, that it was a joke compared to iPad, and that you are forced into \"all that Amazon stuff\". Hmmm, how curious. I explained to him that I loved Amazon, was a Prime member who found it a tremendous value, that I didn't expect it to be a fully functional tablet, didn't need 3G, and that it was exactly what I was looking for. Then, I reminded him that he was perfectly OK with being tethered to the proprietary behemoth known as iTunes, so what was the problem? (The answer is ... he suffers from IT'S-NOT-AN-iPAD-SO-IT'S-CRAP syndrome.)Too Little Memory ... I'll have to admit, I'd have liked to see a 16 GB device for a little more, but as I stated early in the review, I came to terms with it. Amazon was adamant about keeping the price under $200, and with that came sacrifices. Fair enough. I'm over it.  One observant Kindle advocate on a message board addressed the memory complaint of another poster as follows: \"If you really must have more memory, you can buy two of them and still spend less than an iPad costs.\" Indeed.Poor Battery Life ... This issue is the subject of much Internet fodder. So, some reality checking is in order. It's a backlit screen, and a small device, which means it contains a relatively small battery. One cannot expect the kind of battery life one gets with an e-ink reader. Remember that with Wi-Fi on, the device is constantly searching for a network, sucking juice. Remember that the brighter the screen, the more battery it eats. The first day, on the first charge, with Wi-Fi continuously on and the screen dialed up, I got just a few hours of charge. (After a few charges, the battery breaks in and improves.) And now, I am getting exactly what Amazon claims, about eight hours, give or take. Guess what I do? Yep, keep the Wi-Fi off if I don't need it and dial the brightness back considerably ... actually, I prefer it dialed back; I think it reduces eye strain. By the way, on a full charge, I can easily watch five to six hours of streaming video, for whatever that's worth.Poor Substitute For An iPad ... Apples and oranges are both fruits, but you can't substitute one for the other. Duh, it's not a full blown tablet. It's an e-reader with extras. It's a hundred and ninety-nine bucks, for cripe's sake.The Down Side ...Did you think I couldn't find at least a few things that bug me?Smudges ... Like my Droid, the screen is glass and it does take fingerprint smudges to the next level. I'm over it. I just pack a little microfiber cloth and when it bugs me, I wipe it clean.PDFs ... I was hopeful with regards to PDF format because I have a few eBooks that are in that format, as well as a good many User Guides / Owners Manuals for everything from high end cameras to electronic appliances. This is where a 10\" screen would be a benefit. Pinch zooming and dragging the document around is a pain in the ... oops. Then again, I should have expected such ... it's a 7\" screen. My bad.The Price ...It's a hundred and ninety-nine bucks, for cripe's sake!!  Keep that in mind, please.In conclusion ...I think it best to consider the Kindle Fire an e-reader \"friend with benefits\". I'm not the first to say or admit it will never be an iPad killer. Please refer back to the \"apples and oranges\" section when addressing that concept. Oh, and did I mention ...

I had no idea, except that I was saving my swagbucks up for one, and the night before I had figured out how long it would take. To at least February, I figured. Now I do not have a mobile phone that has the fancy bells and whistles on it, so I did not have experience with something like this before. I am used to using a computer but that is a whole different concept. We generate our own electric so during the times of low sun we have to be very frugal with our power use. At night, I was using little book lights to read with. That was the main reason I wanted a Kindle Fire, as I saw that it lights up. I had the feeling it would work well for me.I was one of those people who said I liked holding a physical book in my hands. I said I liked having my books to slip in my purse or carry around the house so when I took a break I could read. Well, I do all of those same things with my Kindle! I actually look forward to getting off my computer every night to read! The fact that you can change the brightness of the light has been a big plus for me. I am at an age when my eyesight isn't the best, even with my glasses. So to adjust the font or the brightness of it is so simple. Depending on how my eyes feel that night, I can make the font larger or the light dimmer, whatever I need. Used to be I'd have to stop reading due to the eye strain.......not anymore!When we first got it, my Kindle was connected to my husband's Amazon account because he ordered it. It was very simple to switch to my account. At first I had a little difficulty with the connection as it would not take my password, then all of a sudden, it was connected. So I would say to have patience with that issue as it may just need to be put in a few times for some unknown reason. It was no big deal though.I cannot get over how fast the books download to the kindle! I am used to the slow satellite connection on the computer, so now I feel spoiled. I seem to be able to read books so much faster on it (maybe because I can see!). It is easy to use and gives me so much enjoyment. Plus, I love all those old public domain books I can now read for free. I probably would have never seen any of them.My friend from Facebook (who put the Kindle in my head to begin with) wants one badly, and she asked me what were the three things I liked about my Kindle. And what three things I didn't like about it. I had to really think to find what I did not like. All I could come up with was that I had to charge the battery every  morning. I love everything about it! The price included! It is surprising to me that it has such a low price.Yes, the Kindle Fire has changed my reading habits for the better!", "Date": "December 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great value and reliable Gateway to all your Media", "Author": "Kippoe \"Kipp Poe Speicher\"", "ReviewID": "RLFP1973B3V5P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm very impressed with the Kindle FIre, I was so thrilled when i heard about the price of it. Since 2009 I have been a True Kindle fan, it has changed my life of the way I read, and now we have the Kindle Fire that will also change the way I listen to music and watch films, and TV programing.Lets start with the video. Wow Hulu+ looks and works great on this, I have it on my PS3 also and it is really buggy on the PS3 but on the Kindle no problems at all. Great picture and sound and easy to navigate. Netflix seems to run very well also other than every once in a while you hear a slight click in the audio. As for Amazon Streaming video it is where this Machine really shines. With a free month of Prime you get plenty of films and TV shows to watch for Free. With a click of the button within seconds you have the movie in amazing clarity and sound in the palm of your hand. Super Troopers was the first movie i watched and was a lot of fun, nice to be able to stop it at any point and then start it right back up where you left off. A nice feature is having it in your carousel so all you have to do is press on it to resume the playback. Side loading video from you own collection is very easy also just plug in the USB to you computer just drag and drop.Music: What can I say but yes i'm in heaven with Amazon and their cloud service I think it was April when they announced  the whole cloud service for music and then they offered unlimited cloud service and thats all it took. I have an obsession for music and have a failing hard drive with over 200 Gigs of music from my collection. So since May I have been uploading my entire music collection to Amazon Cloud and now with a Wifi connection I have all the music at my finger tips with the Kindle Fire. If i'm going to be on the road I can easily hit a button and zoom the music is downloaded to the Fire.Yes it is a dream come true. The ease of just popping on over to the store while listing to the music is all right there.Apps: Along with Amazon's mention of the cloud service they also gave us an app store with a FREE app of the day that I usually start my day checking out and purchasing since the opening just to have plenty of Apps to go with the then rumored Kindle Tablet. Well the day is here and I have plenty of Apps to play with on the Fire. Games, utilities, art programs. they all run great on the Kindle Fire. I also have a Dell Streak tablet and the apps on it are so so sometimes it works other times it just sits there. The Kindle Fire always boots them up and your on your way.Web: It is nice to sit on the couch or at the kitchen table and surf the web, It seems very quick and easy to me I enjoy it just sometime I forget the ability is there right on the Fire.Books: Well here we go back in 2009 i purchased my first Kindle 2 and instantly became a true addict to reading again. Having Dyslexia reading has always been so hard and it took me forever to read a Dead Tree book but then the Kindle came out with the ability to adjust the type size and the line spacing and it was like being reborn I was able to finally read without using my finger following each and every word. Now with the Fire not only do you have the ability to adjust the txt, We also get to be immersed in full color graphics and photos. Reading on the Fire is also a lot of fun with a tap of the finger you can read the definition of a word with in seconds. If thats not enough you can link it right to Google of Wikipedia and explore more.I just love going to the book shelf section and enjoying all the cover art of the books. Your done with a book you are just a tap away from browsing the Amazon Kindle store. The ease of syncing up across all of you Kindle's is just another amazing way Amazon has changed the way we read and enjoy all other forms of media. Sure there a few flaws but it all can be fixed in a firmware update. I hope they put the Twitter posting capability in the reading app into the Fire OS along with the ability to see popular highlights. But those are a few minor things.I hear from others that the battery life is not up to what the iPad offers? I have no problems with the battery life, consider you can buy two Kindle Fires and still save a $100 over the iPad price and then get 14 hours of battery life. I love my eInk display but the Fire is also another great way to read and have all your media at your finger tips.", "Date": "November 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire - Not an iPad killer but well worth taking a look", "Author": "Norman White \"Social Engineer\"", "ReviewID": "R2JO5YXNNTHC1F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My son loves using my iPad so much and I can't get any time with it for myself unless he's asleep or not with me when I was trying to use it so we decided to purchase a tablet for him.We weren't looking to spend anything close to what an iPad costs so we started looking at the $100.00 price point.Originally, we had purchased the Nextbook Next2 book reader/tablet at $95.00.The product was presented as primarily a book reader with tablet capabilities.  I have to say that for a book reader, the Next2 is fantastic.  It does exactly what you need it to do.  As a tablet?  It fails miserably.  Very slow, not very user friendly, the screen is either navigated by touch or by stylus but either one will get you an accidental tap on something and you're navigated away from what you want.  The reason we purchased it was as a gift for my 5 year old son for his birthday.  He would rather have had an iPad as he wouldn't leave mine alone.  So we figured for $100.00, if something happened to it, we wouldn't be all that disappointed.  Overall, the device was definitely not what we were looking for.  I returned it within a week after we gave it to him and hhgregg (where I purchased it) refunded it with no issues.We looked at other tablets online and tried to stay around the $100.00 price point but everything we looked at we didn't have a live device to try before we bought and I wasn't about to start buying devices only to return them a few days later.We finally decided that we trusted Amazon and their products and return policy and we already had a Kindle and were satisfied with that, so we bit the bullet and paid the $200.00 for the Fire and placed the order.It was delivered 2nd day for free as we are Amazon Prime members.  I opened the package (a small box) to find a second box inside.This is the actual Kindle Fire product box.  It's small, very well made and packed very nicely so as to protect the device.I opened the box and pulled out the Fire and turned it on with the small on/sleep button (later on the location and sensitivity of the button).  I found the device was already charged to about 75% and was ready for me to put in my Amazon account information.  Now, I would like to make a warning statement here.  If you are ordering the Fire online, make sure you check mark that the device is a gift and it's for someone else other than you (meaning not your Amazon account).  The reason behind this is that there have been reports of a few (sorry I don't have exact numbers) cases where the package was delivered but when the box was opened it was missing.  A few days later, large amounts of music, videos, books, etc were charged to that account.  I'm sure the individuals and Amazon worked out what happened and things turned out ok as I've heard similar accounts of fraud were handle quickly and efficiently.Once the device was setup with my Amazon account information, it started to load my pre-purchased music, books, videos, etc that I had selected.  The time zone and time was correct including the date.  It was very intuitive to use and the overall feel was similar enough to the iPad that my wife, and son were able to use it with minimal instruction.Let me explain right now that this device was not created as an iPad killer nor if you ask me it will be.  The largest thing that it has going for it over the iPad and other tablets/readers is the size, integration and price point.  The interface I feel was designed to feel like a series of book shelves.  When you want to use something from those shelves, you use it and when you're done with it, it goes back on the shelf.The shelf theme is prevalent all through the interface of the Fire.  The `categories' are:-Newsstand-Books-Music-Video-Docs-Apps-WebYou can choose either items that are stored on the `Amazon Cloud' or on the device itself.Also on each category page is the option to go to the Amazon store.The titles within each category can also be sorted.-Newsstand:  By Recent or by title-Books:  By author, recent or title-Music:  By Playlist, artists, albums or songs-Video: By either Movies or TV and either by Recent or name in either of the sub categories-Docs: By recent or title-Apps:  By recent or Title-Web:  Obviously this is the only one that you can't sort however; there is a bookmark feature or a `favorites' feature that you can utilize as you would on your computer.Now, I'd like to tell you about the two things I mentioned earlier.  The power/sleep button and the account issue.First, the button.  The button is located on the bottom middle of the device.  The button is located so if you're holding the device wrong, you'll end up putting the device in sleep mode.  It's more of a nuisance thing, but still, not the most convenient thing.  My personal opinion is that they should have put it on the top of the device near an edge similar to the the location of the button on the iPad.The account information that is loaded on the device is a plus and a minus in that you don't need to enter your Amazon account password whenever you make a purchase of a book, movie, tv show, music or app.  It's charged to your account and becomes ready for download immediately.  Unfortunately I haven't seen a way to disable this, but I'm going to be getting in contact with Amazon support and see what I can find out.The battery of the Fire lasts.  My son has used it for several days both before he goes to school and after he get's home and it's lasted about 4 days of fairly decent use.  The battery charges fairly quickly and the only downside of the device in that respect is that it does get warm while charging.Videos are crisp and clear and the speakers on it are more than adequate in a home setting.  With the earphone jack it's a nice little device to listen to music while you're sitting in a book store or Starbucks or your favorite coffee house.I'd say if you're debating over getting either the Fire or the iPad (or another tablet), stop by a Best Buy or WalMart and take a look at it.  If you're not dead set on having the full functionality of the iPad but at less than half the price, you'd be best off getting the Kindle Fire.  Like I said earlier, it's not an iPad killer and it wasn't really meant to be, it's Amazon's first foray into the the tablet arena.Some things I'd like to see integrated into future versions of the Fire are:-Removable or upgradeable memory-3G (either paid or free)-Shift the power button to the top-Ability to disable saved account password (if it's not available now and I just haven't found it)Other than that, I don't think there's much that I'd add to it.  It's fairly light and well put together.The Amazon App Store is well put together and has many apps that are both free and paid apps.  Many of them are cross platform (on both the Android platform as well as the iOS).The speed of downloads and the speed of streaming does depend on the wi-fi connection that you have, so please keep that in mind.", "Date": "December 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire vs. Apple iPad 2", "Author": "J. A May \"Andy\"", "ReviewID": "REYN77YM8HPMA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For our anniversary my wife bought me a Kindle Fire and I bought her an Apple iPad 2.  We have been using them for several weeks and the comparison is interesting.  The Kindle cost $200 and the iPad 2 over $700, so what are the differences?  The Kindle Fire does not have a camera or microphone, so no skype.  It does not have 3G either.  These are not a problem for me, but may be important to some.Set up for the Kindle Fire was very easy.  I connected to our home WiFi on the first try, then connected to my home email on the first try, very easy.  Unfortunately, I was unable to transfer my Outlook contacts to the Kindle.  I contacted support and they said this feature was not available.  Hopefully, they will fix this oversight. The Kindle email program is fine, but I will need my contacts and the ability to synchronize them with my other computers.  The Kindle web browser is very good and very fast, not better than the ipad 2, but just as good.  The Kindle Fire works seamlessly with the Amazon Cloud and Amazon.com, it is easy to buy or borrow books, movies and TV shows.  There are lots of apps and games, but I haven't used them much yet.The ipad 2 setup was difficult and my wife had to take it to an Apple store to get everything working, but once she did get everything set up, it worked fine and she got her contacts synchronized with her iphone and Microsoft Outlook, a major advantage.  It works with Apples icloud OK.  She likes the fact that the ipad 2 is larger, I prefer the smaller size of the Kindle, so this is a matter of personal choice.  Battery life is longer on the Kindle.That is about all we know right now.  Obviously, the Kindle is much cheaper and the Apple's additional functionality may not be worth the $500 difference to everyone.", "Date": "December 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Do not know what people are expecting....", "Author": "Shannon Johnson \"chi town girl\"", "ReviewID": "RUOY6DY5R1J0U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I went to look at the one star reviews to see if anyone was having any troubles with their Fire yet, as it is a new product.

Well....a Kindle is a READER - I believe everything extra on the Fire is a complete bonus.  I do prefer to read books on my original Kindle as it is easier on the eyes, but I have downloaded Angry Birds (addicting game btw), watched movies on Netflix, surfed the web, set up contacts in address book and have just essentially played around on it.  I bought the Belkin case because the recommended Kindle case did get a lot of bad reviews.  And the Belkin case works great.  Obviously, people did not read the specs on the Fire before they bought it if they are returning it after a day because of things that were obviously not included on it.I love my Kindle Fire, and the Kindle family.

Others (negative ones, especially) focus on what the Fire isn't, or should be (in the writers' opinions), or on Amazon's shipping, or on customer relations. My comments are focused on  the functionality I wanted out of a unit like this, the ability of the Kindle Fire to deliver, and a few tips and tricks I've learned that have improved my user experience.Firstly, my rating would be 4.5 stars if fractions were possible. I really just love the device. Here's why.What I wanted:  I don't have another tablet, or even a smart phone. I still have what's now called a Kindle Keyboard, and love that for reading. For computing, I have a laptop. I had a 3+ year-old iTouch (pre-camera) that I also have enjoyed and used the bejeezus out of. For awhile, I've wanted something like the iTouch but larger, since using it is like looking and poking at a half-deck of cards. I wanted something to play music, watch Netflix, surf, look at my photos, check and send e-mail or Facebook updates, and sometimes review or make small edits to Word and Excel files - not compose heavily (that's what the laptop is for). If it could play Bejewelled and maybe a couple of other very simple games, even better. (I am not a big gamer.) I have wi-fi at home, and there are plenty of places I frequent that have it as well, so needing a 3G data plan wasn't a priority for me, either.Now, I am not knocking the iPad. It seems like a great device, and everyone I know who has one adores it. But for what simple things I wanted done, even the smallest, wi-fi-only iPad seemed pricy. And other Android tablets also seemed either too costly, too confusing, or too buggy, from reviews I read and from hands-on trials.When I heard about the Kindle Fire, I was interested, and read all I could about it. I was already an Amazon Prime member, so the ability to stream free video seemed nice enough (although Amazon's selection pool is still comparatively shallow). When I heard they allowed an app to stream Netflix, I ordered right away. I'm truly not an early adopter of devices, but Amazon and the Kindle have always done things well for me.What the Fire does:  It does everything I want out of a device, and more. Using my laptop, I uploaded just under 5 gigs of my iTunes library to Amazon's free cloud (the online cloud program walks you right through this, and even searches your computer for music). I've read complaints about the speakers on the Fire, but I think they're awfully, awfully good, better than my laptop speakers, even. The speakers are both on one short side of the unit. The stereo separation isn't quite what you'd get from having them on opposite sides, but you can definitely hear the stereo if you play a mono and a stereo file back to back. Anyway, they're certainly more than good enough for me.I transferred loads of photos to the Fire, using the USB connector that I had on hand from the Kindle Keyboard. Transferring files is a cinch, if you're used to using external devices with your computer, such as a flash drive. The Fire doesn't come with a USB connector, and if you don't have files to transfer, you can probably get along without one, but I've found it nice to do. They display sharp and crisp.Watching videos - Amazon's or Netflix's - is a true joy. The picture is just spectacular, the sound very good (see above), the downloading and buffering (at least on the connections I've tried) fast and invisible. Amazon also seems to be adding movies and shows to the free Prime library, so that's nice, too. The Netflix app also works flawlessly for me, although I've read other reviews that say the picture can sometimes lag the sound.Shortly after I got my Fire, an app called Documents to Go was the free app of the day, and I got it. (I should add two things: the Kindle Fire is clearly made to help you buy stuff, and the App store features a free app of the day, which for me has now become a daily ritual to check.) It allows me to read and edit Word, Excel, and Powerpoint files. With this, the Kindle Fire is now everything I wanted and more. Granted, typing on the Kindle's virtual keyboard, even in landscape format, is nothing like using a real keyboard, but you can go into the unit's settings and turn off things like Auto Capitalization and Auto Correction, and that helps. (There's still an auto suggest feature that doesn't seem to be able to be turned off, and it's annoying; a get-around, when you're using a word that it tries to \"fix,\" is to tap the first word on the left of the auto suggest line at the top of the virtual keyboard, which is always the word you typed, and it will accept it. I hope that a future update, or future versions of Fire, will let auto-suggest be turned off fully.) These same writing observations apply to the Kindle's built-in e-mail app, which checks the accounts I most use, and from which I can read, manage, and reply to messages. (If you want to manage e-mail from an Outlook account or Exchange server, I've heard you have to buy a more detailed app, but since I have just Gmail and Hotmail, this hasn't applied to me.)For games and social networking: I found my Bejewelled, and also Solitaire and Spider Solitaire, and I guess I'm pretty set. I'm not a game person, remember. The pre-loaded Facebook app uses the mobile Facebook setting, which gives me everything I need from it.You'll notice I have said nothing about the Kindle Fire's e-reading. I've looked at a few books on the unit, and actually have decided not to use it for that. There's nothing wrong with it that I've found, but I guess I prefer paper or e-ink to pleasure reading on a backlit screen.Other observations or tips:(1) The screen:  As just mentioned, the Fire is backlit, and it's bright. Very bright. In the settings I turned the brightness all the way down, and it's still lit up more than I need. As for the screen: \"fingerprint magnet\" doesn't begin to describe it. I guess I'll accept having to wipe it off all the time for the scratch-resistance and sturdiness that the gorilla glass offers, though.(2) The Power Button: There are no buttons except for the on-off switch. Many people have complained about the switch being on the \"bottom\" and so being inadvertently hit. I didn't find this to be much of a problem, at first just turning it upside down, and then getting a cover. With the cover, the button is completely recessed. A cover also helps prop it up when I'm watching movies, and just in general makes it easier to hold - it's too narrow for both hands, as I've seen people hold iPads, and it's just a tad too wide on its own to hold comfortably with one hand for long. Otherwise, the size is perfect, and the Fire very portable.(3) User interface: In the first few days, the touchscreen had widely varying responses - sometimes needing several pushes to register, and other times being too sensitive. I've found that, after two weeks of use, this now has largely cleared up. Perhaps the tablet has subconsciously trained me, or perhaps there have been some hidden software updates. I do know I saw an almost immediate improvement after de-registering and then re-registering the device (a tip I read somewhere). Be aware that if you do this, you'll have to re-download or re-transfer all your personal content, and re-do any customized settings, including saved web sites. All your music and apps, free and purchased, will still be in your \"cloud,\" however, for you to add back.(4) Web browsing: the Kindle Fire plays Flash animations, which my iTouch didn't, so I can finally see everything on a page that's there. Yes, I know Flash is on its way out, but plenty of pages still have it, and I don't like to miss things. I've seen, and experienced, that Silk wasn't as fast as some initial claims, but I tried another fix I read about - going into the browser settings and unchecking the \"Accelerate page loading\" box - and I can attest that this speeds up the browser to as fast as any other browser I've used, including Chrome on my laptop.(5) Apps:  I read reviewer complaints about the lack of apps for the Fire, compared to other Android devices or the app-happy iPads and iTouches. I have very simple demands, though (more simple than usual, I think), and so have found everything I need. On occasion, some apps have crashed and the system goes back to the home screen. I haven't experienced this enough to grind my teeth, but did want to note it.(6) The Carousel: On the home screen is the famous (infamous?) carousel, which consists of images of the books and apps used, \"stacked\" in the order of use. Below are \"shelves\" for icons you choose as your Favorites. You can add Favorites by long-pressing icons and selecting. You can also re-arrange Favorite icons by long-pressing them and finger-dragging them around. I find that I mostly ignore the Carousel, and just scroll down to the Favorites, but I would bet that, with all the complaints about it, the ability to turn the Carousel off becomes a future feature.Summary:  I was looking for a basic entertainment device to meet a few specialized interests, and in the Kindle Fire, I found that and more. Is it a full \"tablet\"? Beats me. All I know is, it's now my go-to device for almost everything I do electronically or online outside of work, and I am a fantastically satisfied customer. Only a few performance or customization improvements would make it a hearty five stars for me - not bad for a first release version of a device, I think.**EDITED 2/18/12Since writing the above, I've received two through-the-air updates to the Kindle Fire's operating system. I'm happy to report that almost all of the minor issues noted above -- in particular, the touch responsiveness of the screen, and the characteristics of the home screen Carousel -- have been fixed or improved. I've upgraded by rating from 4 to 5 stars, because this is just a fantastic device, and just keeps getting better.", "Date": "November 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Perfect combination of price and value", "Author": "H. sahay \"gadget junkie\"", "ReviewID": "R29TU3EA646KEP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I will keep it short.This device just works.It is not super fast or super sensitive or an ipad killer or whatever.

The only reason I wanted one in the first place was so I could purchase my textbooks for college in e format and not have to lug them around with me to every class, or to store them forever on a shelf. Textbooks have little to no resale value to its beneficial to keep them from taking up space in my small apartment. After doing a ridiculous amount of research, I learned that the Fire is the only e-reader that allows you to read textbooks. The Nook does not. Now, the Nook tablet might but probably only in PDF format, and then the reading features would not all be available. With the Kindle Fire, most textbooks are available in Kindle form allowing you to highlight (awesome for college students) as as well as look up the words you don't understand. But like I said, these features are not available if the book is in PDF format. Also, there is no camera...but I don't plan on taking pictures with my kindle so for me its a money saving loss. The kindle uses Android technology and has little to no lag at all. The only time I have ever noticed it slow down is when I'm listening to music and trying to run more than a handful of apps at the same time. Netfix streams like a dream. No, the quality is not HD, but then again I have a laptop or TV if I want blu-ray quality. Another money saving loss.I have my 10 favorite CDs, the entire 90 issue Walking Dead collection, 3 textbooks, 4 novels, and about 10 apps. I still have more than 4.5 GB left of space on the device itself. I don't see me running out of space anytime soon. Next term will be much more convenient and fun. I recommend the Kindle Fire for College students especially. If you are one of those students who hates using used books, this is the best way to go to save money, shipping time, and space on the shelf. With all the extra features included, you have things to entertain yourself between classes, or killing time at a bus stop.I give it 5 stars for making my life so much easier when it comes to homework and studying.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Pretty good.

Because I use Amazon's services a great deal, getting the fire was a no brainer. But I was hesitant based on some of the reviews I've read.I took a hard look at how I was using my current crop of devices prior to making this purchase. I basically use them for email, web browsing, games, reading books, shopping,videos and music. I am a content consumer not a content creator. So all of the additional capabilities of the ipad are not utilized by me. I also hesitate taking the Ipad with me anywhere for fear of breaking\\losing a $700 item. I am much less likely to worry about that with a $199 tablet.I purchased the Kindle Fire 12 days ago. The size is perfect. I can hold it and read comfortably with one hand. I dont care what the negative reviews state, for me the browser seems faster on the Fire than the ipad and I can watch videos on sites that support flash. The screen resolution is great for watching movies. The power button is in an annoying spot but I haven't had issues yet accidentally shutting it off. The volume controls are horrible. With only a virtual slide that is hidden in the settings, its too many clicks to get to the volume controls. A simple software update could place the volume control on the main taskbar (still virtual, but much easier to access). I still prefer reading on my 3rd Gen Kindle with E-ink than the LCD screen. Its lighter and just less eye strain. But I still read a portion of the time on the Kindle Fire. Here is an example. My mother had surgery and there were endless hours sitting at the hospital. I brought the Kindle Fire, pulled in a few games, movies, and two books and was entertained for hours without a wi-fi connection and could toggle between game playing,videos and reading. I kept the tablet in my jacket when I wasnt using it. I would have never brought the ipad to the hospital or had the option to throw it in my jacket.Shopping and access to Amazon Prime's videos are really where the device shines. The resolution isn't as good as the Ipad's but its close, and quite frankly, its good enough for me. The app store isn't on par with apples yet, but they have a pretty good selection and if the fire takes off that will change very quickly.When I got down to the heart of it, for what I actually use these devices for, the Kindle Fire is a cheap alternative to an Ipad that has all of the functionality that I want at less than a third of the price. Im not doing my taxes, writing a novel or working on complex spreadsheets with these things (I dont think most people are). I never use the ipad's camera ,the quality is horrible and where am I dragging this thing to take pictures. I have a tiny digital camera with 5x the resolution of the ipad.Hands down the ipad is far superior from a technology standpoint. But the fire is the perfect portable device I can throw in my jacket at an affordable price. I'm having some fun with it.

In my defense, Apple was here first :) I am writing this because I have had the pleasure of watching my 80 year old father purchase and use this device.  As stated in my title, this Machine seems more suited to entertainment at this point, although I'm sure there are and will be some productivity uses as developers build for it.What is really exciting here is ease of use, both with the device itself and interface with the cloud drive feature.  The registration process was a breeze and it comes out of the box ready to roll.  The icons are limited and that is good.  My father has mostly picked them up in two days.  It is really nice to see him play with the thing and not be worried about Windows crashes and the like.  The size is very nice as is the weight.  It is light to hold but feels very well put together.  The screen is bright and reasonably high contrast.  My dad has a rather pathetic wireless setup and he was able to get a movie streaming from Amazon Prime in only 15-20 seconds. The streaming was smooth and without interruption while I was watching.  Purchases on the device are easy as well.  Obviously we will be looking for a greater diversity of Apps to appear over time. Also, while the Newstand feature is cool, I hope there will be some free apps like the IOS USA Today. Right now it seems to only be available for a price on the Fire.The only glitch so far is that the Fire didn't like my dads router security protocol, which was WEP. A quick change to WPS and we were good to go.The Fire will have limitations for some, but it sells for a great price, it's easy to use and it's fun!

I always felt the iPad was way overpriced for the what I want to use it for (portability, e-reader, play games, web browsing).  I was excited to hear that Amazon was releasing the fire and pre-ordered it on the first day.  It has been more than a week since I used it and I believe Amazon hit a home run with the KF(Kindle Fire).  I am mainly comparing with the nook because that is it's main competitor.  Here is a list of what I like and what needs improvement:What I like:Price.  The $199 price is awesome.  Everything you get on this device is worth more than $199.  Considering that Amazon is selling this at a loss is a win for the consumer.  You are getting the most bang for your buck from this device.Design.  I can understand BN wanting to create a unique look to the nook but in my opinion, the nook tablet looks ugly.  I prefer the kindle fire with the minimalist design.  The nook is bulky compared to KF.  I agree with some people's comment that the nook looks like a toy.Apps.  Much more apps on Amazon than BN.  I really want to see multimedia apps on the nook color but it is very limited.  I like the free apps every day on Amazon.  Many more programs and games on Amazon.Memory.  More than 1GB of usable space on KF over nook tablet.  I am glad I decided to go with KF over the nook tablet.  Yes, you can add a SD card on the nook but that increases power consumption and add more cost to the device.  Also internal memory is a lot faster than SD cards.  When I used the nook color, I never went over the 8GB and I really did not need the SD card.  With cloud storage and tight integration with the KF, you will get a lot more space on it.  BN made a big mistake by only allowing 1GB of user space on the nook tablet.-Much better music player.  The music player is a lot better that the nook.  Very easy to navigate, download music.  I put my music collection in the cloud and can download any songs I want to the KF.-KF has a much better interface that the nook color.  The top bar is always visible for all your content.  It is smartly design to work in either vertical or horizontal layout.  I like that at any time I can click on the home button on the bottom to go back to the main page.-The screen is beautiful.  Very clear.  The videos do pop on the display.  The problem with the nook color is the flickering display.  I understand the nook tablet also has the same problem.  I can easily read text on the KF and the games look very sharp on it.-Performance.  The dual core really helps with web page rendering, video playback and with games.  I always believe devices like this are a one app device.  It is not like a laptop where I am using several applications at the same time.  I mainly use one app at a time so the 512mb of ram is perfect for that.Books and e-Magazines.  I prefer the KF over the nook with e-magazines.  It has a better zoom function (text layout) that I can switch to over the magazine layout.  All the books I purchased for my Kindle 3 showed up on the Kindle Fire.  I like the night display so I do not have to use a reader light.Some issues to fix:-The touch panel interface needs to be calibrated.  I think in the next update, they should put in a setting to calibrate the touch interface.  Sometimes you have to press a couple times for the KF to register your input.-The silk web browser is not really that fast.  I tried it out but I do not see any difference in speed between the android browser on the nook and the silk browser.  What I did do is downloaded the Dolphin web browser on the KF.  Very fast, more features and the interface allows you to use the full screen of the KF. [The dolphin browser HD is 3rd party so you need to allow 3rd party apps on the KF in the settings].-The carousel on the main page should go away or allow the user to clear the history.  I never use it.  I also like to show off the KF to people but do not want to show what I am looking at or reading.  You should be able to hide it or clear the history.-Buttons.  I do miss having actual buttons on the device to control the volume.  The power button placement I read on other reviews can be fixed by turning the device so the power button is on top.  I also like doing that so my headphone jack is not hitting my leg while I listen to music while reading books.Overall, I think with some tweaking from Amazon with an OS update, the Kindle Fire is only to get better.  I remember when the nook color got better when they release the 3rd update to it.

Set up was so easy, it came already registered and recognized me when I turned it on. I did miss the Apple packaging though as the Kindle Fire just fell out of the box. Still it's about what's inside.Over the last week, it has become my go to device to slip into my purse instead of the iPad 2 and Kindle 2nd gen. It straddles both functions, and if you're like me who is tired of carrying a heavy purse due to the many devices I have to tote, it is a good alternative. Good, not great. If I knew I was just going to read a novel I'd prefer the e-ink Kindle. So before leaving home, if I knew I was just going to browse and type emails or play a game or an e-instrument, or edit pics or movies I would carry the iPad 2. If I am just running out of the house and may stop by a coffee shop or catch a moment here and there to do random stuff, including reading I would reach for the Kindle Fire. At home, it makes a better bathroom reader than iPad 2 as it is less slippery with it's rubberized back and size and it's lighter to hold up in bed. On the couch, I mostly prefer iPad 2.What I love:--Crystal clear screen - reads just like an iPhone 4/ 4S--Size - the lightness makes it easy to carry and easy to hold in one hand to read, with the iPad 2 I always have to rest it on my lap and the screen isn't as nice as the Kindle Fire. However, the Kindle Fire starts to get heavy after I've read a few pages and I miss the lightness of the e-Ink Kindle.--Colors - are gorgeous on Kindle Fire, it's really pretty and watching TV shows/movies is great. I don't miss the larger screen of the iPad 2 when watching shows on this.--Android apps can play on Kindle Fire - If you're not too much into games this works just fine--Amazon Cloud - Stores all my books and music and I can stream it over wireless.--Prime videos stream free - I could not do this over iPad 2 and since I canceled Netflix I like having Prime video access--Library books can be borrowed - this process is seamless as the books I download from my library appear on all my Kindle devices if I upload them on any one of them including the Fire.What I miss (over iPad 2, earlier Kindles):e-Ink - Reading Kindle Fire is easier on eyes than iPad 2 but still not as great as e-Ink. So if you read a lot and mostly black and white books then an e-Ink device may still be the best solution.Too small for magazines /comics - Some of my interactive magazine apps are not available for Kindle, plus it's harder to read magazines on Kindle. Same goes for comics, pinch and zoom also does not work with the comics which is a miss as it's difficult to read small print of some comics.Calendar syncing - Kindle Fire is mainly a media consumption device, and the calendar etc is not integrated like iPad 2Unavailability of some apps - Although I was surprised at the many apps Kindle Fire supports I do miss some media apps like ABC player to watch my favorite shows. Not sure if this is due to the Android platform or Kindle Fire specially restricts some TV channel apps.What Amazon needs to fix:Touch responsiveness - I miss the response of my Apple devices. Sometimes it is too responsive and I accidentally kept going to links or at other times it feels too slow.Slow browser - The Silk browser is not as fast as they promised. In fact, it's slower than my iPad 2 or iPhone 4. Plus it feels a little clunkier to browse.Sound - The sound from Kindle Fire is too tinny, I know it's small but my iPhone packs a much better punch than this thing.Bluetooth connectivity - My bluetooth sound docks will not work with Kindle Fire like with iPad 2. This is a miss as I have to use this thing with headphones. As the Kindle Fire is intended for media consumption, this would have been a nice feature to have.What would be nice to have:SD card slot, Camera - but that can push up the costs so I am fine without them as long as they fix other things.Overall, I think Kindle Fire beats the Nook Color hollow, and offers a nice, viable option to the iPad 2 depending on how you use your device. If you want it primarily for gaming and browsing, iPad or another Android tablet may be a better option. However, for casual browsing, reading and playing word oriented games, listening to music, watching videos, it is a nice alternative at a great price point. Don't buy a cover or a plastic shield, it really doesn't need it as long as you don't abuse it and will increase the weight.", "Date": "November 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Everything I wanted", "Author": "vrod", "ReviewID": "R298V0YA9XSTLI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Kindle Fire does everything I want it do and everything it is supposed to do as advertised.

It's definitely worth the price.", "Date": "November 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "4 *and a Half* Stars- Truly a Great Buy", "Author": "Rob L.", "ReviewID": "R17X9N2X6QF9E8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First, let me start off by saying this: this tablet is made for media consumption and entertainment, NOT creation (such as words documents, PowerPoints, etc.). Also, you will not be able to find a better tablet for $200, or even $300. This is an excellent tablet for the price. It actually costs Amazon $201.70 to produce, and yet they sell it to their customers for $199. I rate the Kindle Fire 4 1/2 stars out of 5. The missing half star comes from the choppiness of the OS that is running on the Fire. I will begin my review by stating the flaws of the KIndle Fire.THE OPERATING SYSTEMThis is one of the only flaws that I see in the Fire. The OS looks nice, has excellent features, and s easy to navigate and understand. However, the responsiveness of it is not great. Sometimes, you'll push a button or do a gesture and nothing will happen, and you'll have to do the same thing again to get it to do what you want. Also, when you tilt that screen sideways, the OS does not do a smooth flip like iOS does, instead it just \"pops\" up and loads-- it looks pretty cheesy. My final complaint: on the home screen of your  Kindle Fire, it shows all of the recent history. This is fine for some people, but others may want some privacy. So far, I have not figured out a way to delete certain things of the history display, nor turn it off.Those are the only flaws I see in the Kindle Fire's OS, and much of that is correctable by a software update, which will be likely to come. And personally, the responsiveness and sometimes the choppiness does not bother me very much, as the Fire has a small amount of RAM for a tablet and the unit ONLY COSTS $200.OTHER SMALL FLAWSThe Power Button- The power button is located in an awkward spot on the Kindle. It is easy to accidentally hit and put your device into sleep mode, or turn it completely off. I believe that once you get familiar with holding the Kindle, it will not be an issue. But this seems to be a common irritation for newbies with this device, including myself. I do know that if you get a case for your Kindle Fire, this flaw is eliminated because the exterior of the case rises past the bottom of the Fire, which would make accidentally hitting the power button difficult.The Silk Web Browser- Amazon hyped us all up for this extremely fast web browser. Well, it isn't fast at all in comparison to other devices when used with the stock settings. The stock settings include plugins, accelerated page loading, and optimization for desktop view. A plugin that is used in this Web Browser is Adobe Flash, which undoubtedly slows your device down. Adobe Flash is meant for either much more powerful tablets or an actual computer, not a phone or mini-tablet. Flash also consumes your battery life like crazy. Do te following to make your Silk Web Browser ACTUALLY very fast: open up the Browser, hit the menu button at the bottom of the screen, hit the Settings button, and then find the following options:Enable plug-ins: offAccelerate page loading: UncheckedDesktop or mobile view: MobileBam. You now have a fast Web Browser.COMMON PROBLEMS I HAVE SEEN COMPLAINTS ABOUTNot being Able to Delete the Stock Applications That Come with the Device- Many people are upset that they cannot delete the stock apps that are on the Fire. To do this, simply click on the app, install it, and then click on it again and select \"Remove from Device\". You will no longer have that app on your device.Slow Browser- I already explained that up above. It is the user's fault if they decide to load Web pages optimized for real computers with 20\" monitors on their Kindle that only has a 7\" screen and limited hardware.Power Button- Just be careful when holding your Kindle or get a case (the case, as said above, would make hitting the power button on accident almost impossible).Now, time to go into the good things of this device!PLEASING-TO-LOOK-AT OSWhen I played with the demo Fire at Target, I loved the way the OS looked and functioned, minus the sometimes-annoying lagg. It is incredibly easy to navigate and learn, it is easy to use 95% of the time, and it looks incredible.FREE CLOUD STORAGEThis device does only have 8 GB, and 6 GB are available to the user (2 GB is taken by the OS). This, mixed with the Cloud's 5 GBs of free storage is plenty for me. This is, in fact, a Kindle, and if you are buying this because you want to store your top 10 favorite movies on it, then go buy a mobile DVD player. Kindles are meant for entertainment, but at the same time they are not meant to fill up with movies. They are meant to fill up with books, (and in the Fire's case) music, magazines, apps, and the occasional movie. The 6 GB storage on the Fire is plenty if you are looking to store a couple hundred songs, a ton of books, 50 apps, and a couple magazines and a movie-- which is exactly what I want. Plus, you can store movies in the Cloud before you go on a trip, and you can download them whenever you have wifi.THE PRICEThe price is outstanding. $199 for a tablet of this quality is unheard of. It definitely is not an iPad killer, simply because the iPad costs 3x as much as the Fire does.OVERALLThis tablet is great for you if you are interested in books, music, magazines, movies, web browsing, and email, and the occasional game. With Amazon Prime, you have access to thousands of movies, TV shows, and books, and you get free 2-Day shipping. Also, if you have a Netflix and/or Hulu account, then this is the ultimate movie-streaming device. The apps that are included in the app store are not enormous in number, but there are good apps, and a decent amount of them. The Amazon music player is excellent and easy to use. Finally, the Cloud storage gives you plenty of free room-- you can even upgrade to 20 GB of Cloud storage for only $20 a year.Once software updates are released to fix the lagg and choppiness of the OS, I will change my rating to 5 stars. I hope you all have a happy Thanksgiving, and enjoy your Kindle fire!

It does everything Amazon claims. I find it to be very easy to use /User friendly. From basic things like adjusting the screen brightness or adding wi-fi connections to adjusting font size, screen color, font style and borders for books are all just a screen tap away. The web browser is impressively fast (those reviewing it as okay or slow need to fix there wi-fi connection) and accommodates all my web browsing needs. You can store multiple wi-fi connection points and it will automatically connect soon as you are in range. My neighbors and I both have wi-fi networks and I can go from my house to theirs with out loosing connection.I was highly impressed with the video playback and streaming quality.The video playback is brilliant and smooth. The screen size is more than adequate to watch a full movie and enjoy it in vibrant rich color. You can take advantage of streaming tons of movies and shows from amazon prime (i like using amazon prime personally even though I have netflix) or download and stream from netflix or hulu.Book reading is enjoyable with several custom features to cater to your personal reading preferences. Reading e-comics on it are another enjoyable experience with the ability to just flip through page by page or read it with animated frame by frame scrolling. The kindle with its *case still only weighs as much as a small book. (My *case purchased by roocase doubles as a multi angled stand for easy reading and general use).I don't understand why people are complaining about where the power button is, I don't see the problem.One: even if you do bump it, that only turns the screen off. It doesn't turn the kindle off completely.Two: the screen has 360 degree turn  radius so if you think it should be on the top, turn it upside down and the screen flips over. Problem solved!!!Three: if it was placed where others suggest, someone else would complain that it should be on the bottom. They had to place it some where so they did. Get over it!!!The main page has fast access to all its program functions. I like the custom favorite list at the bottom (which resembles a book shelf) which allows you to arrange all your favorite apps websites and even songs and videos downloaded or streamed in any order you wish for easy access to the things you like the most. I like that it isn't bulky or cumbersome to carry around. It is slim, light weight, able to be carried in a coat or hoodie pocket. And it puts off very little heat.I will conclude with this. The kindle fire is an excellent product that lives up to its claims and at a price that is a steal for even the most thrifty of shoppers.

Now there are multiple e-ink devices, at reasonable prices that can do the same and more. However, if you are a night reader, with a spouse, or significant other, then you have experienced trying to get a proper reading light, keeping it charged, and hoping it did not fall off. And oh, by the way...you were going to spend $10-20 for it. The fire solves the problem for the night reader, by adjusting the brightness it is perfect for the wee hours when sleep eludes. Probably a bargain just for that and the brilliant color. But...it does all of those other neat things, too. It seems that comparing a reading device with access to all of the Amazon content to an IPAD or other tablet device is missing the point entirely. If that is what you want - buy that and don't mess with the Fire. I understand the poor reviews from folks who have technical problems or WiFi connection problems out of the box.

I'm an old timer and just got the Kindle Fire as my first E-reader.  I'm really thrilled with it, and if you're looking for a very nice gift for a retired person who doesn't yet have an E-reader; or even someone who already has an E-ink Kindle; this could be it.I've had my eye on a Kindle for a long time, but was waiting for a color version.  As a 6-year Amazon Prime member, the wait was obviously for one from Amazon.  Being on a small fixed income, I wasn't ready to give up going to the thrift shop and picking up a few books for a couple of bucks in favor of slightly-reduced prices on new books via the Kindle.  However, with the Kindle, I have a handy reading device on which I've already downloaded a few free books. Today I made my first purchase, a ninety-nine cent deal of the day which looks very intriguing.  I've also borrowed a new book I wanted; but considered too expensive; from the Amazon Kindle library.It was amazing to me, upon clicking \"music\"; where I expected only to find the few music downloads purchased from Amazon.com; to find that all the music I've downloaded to my PC from CD's was already available on the Kindle, and my PC wasn't even on. As the sound quality is less than stellar, and there's no Bluetooth with which to connect it to my bluetooth-enabled hearing aids, I'll stick to my PC and Ipod for listening to music.  I don't know yet whether downloaded movies have closed captioning -- a must for me even with excellent speakers.Though it's certainly easier to use Facebook on the PC, the Kindle will work on it for a fast login while out of town or from a local wi-fi eatery on those all-too-frequent days when my DSL line is down.  It will be so much easier than lugging a laptop around.I do look forward to playing games on the Kindle, but the main reason for purchasing it was as a book reader, and being able to download a book instantly is well, gratifying. I enjoy Prime for getting books in two days.  This is right now!The screen is easier on the eyes than a PC screen, and very comfortable for reading in bed.  My husband loves that I can now read in bed without turning on the bright overhead light.Having not used touch screens before, I'm still feeling my way around, and will be reading much more of the excellent Managing Kindle manual on Amazon.com. The on/off button at the bottom of the device drove me crazy at first, as in just holding the Kindle to read I accidentally turned the Kindle off about every 30 seconds.  Fortunately it can be turned upside down and the text turns with it.  This completely solves the problem of the on/off button by putting it at the \"top\" of the device where your finger doesn't accidentally travel.Oh, another reason to get this for grandma is that the font can be enlarged to make it much easier to read for folks with impaired vision, which a lot of us elders have.  The default size is fine for now, but in a few years...I'm not saying this wouldn't be a good gift for younger people too (well maybe not teens; who would would probably prefer the much-more-expensive Ipad) but for people who love to read, those who don't have unlimited room to store bulky books, or who like being able to get books inexpensively and instantly, this is a life changer. It's an E-reader with delightful bonuses.

I almost never order the first model of anything because I want someone else to get the kinks out of it first. I opened the box. It was charged enough for me to start using it right away and it was already registered to my account. Its quick intuitive interface allowed me to sign onto my home network and my cloud drive was instantly available. I am an Amazon girl and a Prime member, which makes the Fire even better. Shopping is a breeze, although I have supplemented my shopping on the Fire with my laptop. I find that it's easier to edit my cart on my laptop than on the Fire. Streaming is as fast as my Acer netbook so I can take advantage of all the free Prime content out there. The sound isn't quite as good, but haven't done earbuds yet, just speakers. Reading is wonderful. I personally like reading a backlit screen, but I have my first Kindle if I ever need e-ink instead. Of course backlit means less battery life - a tradeoff I am willing to make.The touchscreen is very responsive, but it did take me a few minutes to figure out all the right places on the screen. Of course, I didn't read the user's guide so I see it as a very user-friendly interface indeed when a few minutes of experimentation takes you wherever you need navigate on a brand new device. I wanted the Fire mostly because of magazines and children's books. The screen is small, but I don't mind going to text mode to read the articles. I just love magazines and I wanted to be able to experience the \"feel\" of the layout. I can do that on the Fire and most of the illustrations zoom nicely so I can look at those too. You can read the magazine without going to text mode, but I just find it easier and more satisfying to switch back and forth as I progress through the articles. The Android OS makes everything work so efficiently - facebook, Google, Yahoo, web searches. While not as efficient as my laptop, it is much better than my phone, which does a pretty good job for a phone. So...I am having crazy, wicked fun with this device.

I am an ardent iPhone and MacPro user. My fiance vastly prefers his iPad to this device, while I strongly prefer the Kindle.I purchased this device primarily for:- Reading books- Light web browsing (reading recipes and blogs, not intensive video watching or commenting on blogs)- Reading large documentsI do not play games.  I did not intend to watch videos on the Kindle, but because of the free Prime videos, I do sometimes watch movies.  My fiance uses his iPad as a computer SUBSTITUTE (he does not have a home computer), whereas I use my Kindle as a computer SUPPLEMENT (I have a laptop which functions very well, is new, etc).The iPad is better in some regards.  If you play games, you will want an iPad.  The screen size on the iPad is obviously larger, but I wanted something I could set in my purse and the Kindle is MUCH easier to carry around all day.  If you are going to spend most of your time watching movies, you will probably prefer an iPad (I would say the Kindle's screen misses this by maybe an inch). In addition, if you want to do computer-style web browsing, get an iPad.  The screen on the Kindle sometimes glitches and it is simply not as smooth as Apple's technology.  In addition, I cannot imagine having my music library on the Kindle as it is just not well-organized.However, despite this, the Kindle is the clear winner for me, for the following reasons:(1) Free Amazon Content: I use this so much more than I thought I would.  With Amazon Prime, there are great benefits. It's nice to not have to buy a bunch of stuff for the device having just bought an expensive device.(2) Better reading experience: No one has ever liked iBooks.  Amazon's library and prices are vastly superior. In addition, the reading view on the Kindle is much better and more closely resembles an actual book.  Loading from Amazon onto the iPad is a royal pain, so if you want Amazon books, this is a serious dealbreaker.(3)Price: For what I was going to do with the tablet, I could not justify the iPad price tag, especially considering my investment in my macbookpro and my iPhone.  This was probably the deal breaker, with the free Amazon content as a close second.(4) Portability: I am 5'2 and I have trouble carrying a lot of \"stuff\" (ergo the switch to ebooks).  I can definitely feel my fiance's iPad when it's in my purse, whereas the Kindle is more like having an extra wallet, if not lighter.  This was hugely important to me after a back injury last spring and anyone considering the iPad should consider the size strongly.While I don't think the Kindle is for everyone, and it does have flaws, it is the best non-iPad on the market.  The price and portability are extremely good, making up for some of its shortcomings.  While I am glad I have my iPhone and my MacBookPro in addition to this device, it is increasingly my go-to for web browsing and email.  In addition, it is an excellent reading device and fun for watching Amazon's free videos.

Cimicata", "ReviewID": "R2CJI276LPL4JU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got the Kindle Fire less than a week ago as an early birthday gift from my wife and I've been enjoying it immensely since first opening the box. Before I even unnboxed it my wife unregistered it (it came with her Amazon account info). It was already charged (about 65%), started right up, connected with wifi no problem and registered it with my Amazon account all in about 2-3 minutes. All the Amazon apps I have on my phone were also right there in my Kindle cloud and ready to be installed immediately. This is my first Kindle (my wife has a Kindle e-reader).A few tips for those just receiving their KF: There is no signature required on delivery so try to make sure you are home when it is delivered because it comes in a box that says \"Kindle Fire\" right on the box with no additional exterior wrapping, so if you live in an area where you worry about your mail/deliveries being pilfered, beware. The second tip is that I noticed that the KF would not update its system files to 6.3 until it was fully charged and only then would it download the update, so if you are wondering why your KF does not automatically update itself like it is supposed to, try charging it fully first.The display is amazingly good and the colors and resolution are terrific in my opinion. The only adjustment I've made to it is to turn down the brightness at night to be easier on the eyes. Another really great feature is the ability to change fonts and font sizes on the fly so sometimes I read without my glasses, something only those who wear glasses to read might appreciate.Apps I have on my tiny 3.1 inch phone look completely different, much more detailed and in vibrant colors. Games like Angry Birds also play much more smoothly and quickly without any glitches.Although I am a pretty fair hacker (I have my Stone Age Motorola Backflip rooted and running Cyanogenmod 7), I did not and probably will not root the KF or install an alternate OS or launcher. I really like the carousel and the KF Android modified system is good enough for my needs. I even have remote access to my computer and can play any files on it through my kindle using a free app named Team Viewer available at the Amazon app store.For those who just absolutely, positively have to have Google Play (Andriod Market) apps on the KF but don't want to root the KF for whatever reason (it voids the warranty is one good reason), that was pretty easy as well and most, though not all, run just fine on the KF (excluding widgets). To accomplish that easily and quickly I just installed a free Google Play app on my phone named File Expert, used it to backup the apps I wanted from my phone as .apk files (just a few clicks necessary), then copied the apk files from my phone to a folder on my desktop computer. Just a suggestion, but I also suggest installing Dropbox on your android phone as well before doing this. Also, install one of the free file explorers on your KF (I used ES File Explorer, available on Amazon app store for free) so you can find the files once you transfer them to the KF.Then I connected my KF to my computer (using the micro USB from my phone)and copied and pasted the apk files from my computer desktop folder to a folder called Android Apps I made on my KF with ES File Explorer. After pasting simply go to that folder on your KF in ES File Explorer and click on the apk files and presto, they are installed. Now I have my Giants, Yankees and NFL apps that I can't live without on my KF and am a happy camper.Note that this only has to be done once because after you install Dropbox on your KF in the future all you have to do to get your apk files there is to upload the apk to Dropbox to make it available on your KF. Alternately, you can also (though I haven't tried this) email the apk files to your kindle and just click on them to install them.So far I have found the Amazon experience with Prime to be excellent and will probably subscribe to Prime when my free 30 trial is up. The book deals to Prime members, borrowing rights and videos available seem to be worth it. I would be interesting in hearing from others, however, as to whether Netflix (for movies and videos) or Hulu are better deals.", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "the best e-reader on the market", "Author": "Maximo92f", "ReviewID": "R3TNOY8IZ952TX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are reviewing this as an e-reader you have to give the Kindle Fire 5 stars.

This is an e-reader with lots of extras, such as a nice web browser, app device, and a first rate Amazon, Netflix, and Hulu ,etc streaming device. The Kindle Fire is fast, smooth,and overall very responsive. The virtual controls prevent accidental tapping of controls while reading, watching video, listening to music etc. The size makes it easy to use one handed though it is much weightier than the original Kindles. The back lit screen makes reading in all light conditions easy though it does have a glossy screen so reading outdoors is a little more difficult than an original Kindle, one place the original still rules the roost. I do wish the power button was on top instead of the bottom but that seems to be my only complaint so far.  With Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, and Rahpsody passes the Kindle Fire delivers tons of entertainment when connected to wifi  and tons of book reading and games offline.

They're similar tablets, but different, IMHO. The Vtab has a larger screen, and accepts micro SD cards (where I've inserted the largest card it'll accept - 32 GB). It has a camera, which I've had no reason to use. It does take adequate pictures, but who really needs the ability to take pictures with their tablet?Along with the larger screen, memory card, camera, and other features of the Vtab, comes additional weight. The Vtab specs state the \"gross\" weight is 2.5 LBS, vs Fire's 14.6 OUNCES, which does end up being significant over time. I'm recovering from a stroke, resulting in left-side weakness (for the time being), and I really do notice the extra size and weight of the Vtab. For me, it was tiring to try and hold the larger, heavier Vtab with one hand, even for a short while, whereas my Kindle Fire, with the narrower screen and lighter weight, fits quite nicely in one hand - even my weaker hand. My Fire fits in my bag more easily, even with its case.I disagree with those who criticize the lack of an external memory card slot. My understanding of Amazon's lack of any external memory slot is because the intent is to draw files and apps from the Cloud, rather than storing them on a memory card or internal memory. Frankly, I now prefer having no memory card slot. My Vtab has a micro SD card slot. With the Vtab, I was constantly juggling/moving apps and files between the SD card and the internal memory, because I was receiving \"memory card is full\" alerts far too often for my liking. 32 GB fills up surprisingly fast, and I'm not interested in spending my time deciding what files/apps should stay or go, and whether to put them on the SD card or the internal memory. I like the simplicity of no external memory with my Fire, and so far, haven't missed it.I used to carry both the Vtab and the Fire with me when I'm out and about, thinking I might want, or need, both. But after just a few weeks of owning the Fire, I'm finding myself taking just the Fire. So far, I haven't found myself wishing I'd taken the Vtab instead.I think the Kindle Fire was/is a great purchase for me. I like my Vtab, but I also like my Kindle Fire. I tried both, and like both.

No, it's mine. My Kindle Fire is her favorite, absolute favorite device in the whole house.It used to be when she would wake up, I was the first thing she would look for, not so anymore. She stumbles out of the bedroom, all blurry eyed and makes a bee line to where the Kindle is charging.No \"good morning mom\" - nothing. I am chopped liver in comparison - I might as well be that ratty old stuffed animal in the back of the closet. hmmm I hope that's a stuffed animal....She knows how to maneuver the screen so that she can pull up Netflix or any one of her favorite game apps. She learned it more quickly than I did! My Tech Savvy little tot even figured out how to order an entire season of Blue's Clues. Apparently there is no \"parental lock\" to prevent greedy little fingers from dipping into the app \"pot\"on the Kindle Fire. Maybe slightly genius on their part.The one thing that I must commend Amazon on is the pure durability of the product. My child has smeared banana on it, spilled hot chocolate all over it, dropped in on the kitchen floor, and it's still perfect. My only complaint is that the battery does not last long enough. Of course for the average use I am sure it is just fine...my kid is a power user!Aside from the Netflix app, Amazon offers some great apps for kids, especially free ones. We are a big fan of free at this house!Prior to receiving the Kindle Fire, I looked into getting her a portable DVD player. Okay, I'm not proud but there are times when it comes in handy! Such as when we go grocery shopping. She will sit so delightfully in the cart, while I meander through a store, provided she has the tablet in her hands. The portable DVD players ranged from around $60 - $120 and all they do is play DVD's. The Fire is $199 and I can load it with educational games, something I would prefer her to do over watching videos.Of course when I can pry it from her sticky little fingers, I can actually use it to go online and do whatever I want.

The Kindle Fire is not an iPad killer, it's a very different device. If you know this and are aware of the Kindle Fire's strengths you will be more than happy with it, as I am. I used to read almost exclusively on the Kindle app on my iPad but always found it to be too awkward and heavy to hold one handed comfortably for long periods of time,  and the resolution of the text on the iPad is not great.With the Kindle Fire, the smaller size and the crisper text is fantastic for reading. I use it as my main e reader and it's almost perfect for that in my opinion. If you don't like reading off of lcd screens you probably won't like it as a reading device. I'd recommend one of Amazon's e ink Kindles if that is the case. If you want a smaller and lighter device than the iPad to read on this is much better in my opinion. Although I bought it primarily for reading, I've been impressed with the quality of the Amazon streaming movies and the daily free apps they feature in their App store. They give you a free month of Amazon Prime so you can try out the free movie selection and a free loaner book.

It's not necessarily buggy, but it's definitely not perfect--and that's ok. I think people who are used to iOS are the ones who have the biggest issues with usability of the software because in general, Android is not quite as snappy as iOS and people assume that means something is wrong.All of the issues and complaints people have with the Fire are easily fixed via software updates. For instance, B&N; properly updated the first gen nook within a couple of months of its release which fixed touch screen sensitivity issues and also provided a better overall UI experience (both common complaints with the Fire). Buying the first generation of any device is still a slight gamble, but software updates are able to fix so many things now that a lot of the simple problems in the UI will easily be resolved soon (and if not we, always have the option to root).", "Date": "December 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Kindle fire", "Author": "Mark Celusniak", "ReviewID": "R32JWP63Z9VD65", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Despite the many complaints around the web and papers about the fire, it's just fine.

I was actually on the verge of considering an iPad purchase in October when I thought to look online and see if by any slim chance Amazon was considering a tablet (apparently I'd been out of the rumor-loop!).  Was THRILLED to see one was about to be released and I ordered mine quickly on the day of the announcement.  And then WAITED along with everyone else for a very long month to pass.I have an iPad at work, for work use, and a friend cautioned me that surely if I spent much time with an iPad I would want one of them for personal use instead of a Kindle Fire - there was no way (in his mind) the two could stand up next to each other, right?WRONG - the Fire truly is a miniature iPad, and I say that as a user of both.  With a few exceptions, I haven't yet found anything that I can do on the iPad that I can't do on my Fire.  YES, there are some apps available on iPad that aren't available on the Fire - but so far none that have rocked my world by not being able to do it on the Fire.I've had mine since release date, so I'm about a month in on using it every single day.  Here's a synopsis of my thoughts/feelings about it, with an emphasis on some of the recent press-criticism:SPEED:  Yes, the iPad browser is faster, but I don't find the Silk browser to be slow by ANYBODY'S definition.  The rudimentary browswer on the Kindle 3 was mind-numbingly slow - on the Fire it is excellent, as fast as I could want.  I don't wait for pages to load at all.  It is just so convenient to pick up and check my email real quick, or navigate to a site I just saw an ad for on TV.  Trying to do that on the K3 was an exercise in frustration and patience.  Doing such simple tablet-tasks on the Fire is a dream.TOUCH SENSITIVITY:  Here I have found some bugs, but apparently so has Amazon and a promised update in the next week or so should fix it.  I find I sometimes have to touch something several times to get it to activate, though not always and not consistently in one app or another.  In some apps the touch control is downright sensitive, requiring only a very light touch (such as the Mahjong game I play endlessly on the Fire).PRIVACY:  Recent press has had a field day with the fact that anyone picking up my Fire can instantly see whatever I've been doing, as every book, app, webpage, etc shows on the carousel for all to see.  I never really thought about this being a problem, but I am looking forward to a promised update that will apparently allow me to limit what rides on the carousel (I will limit it to just books, if that is an option).BATTERY LIFE:  Call me crazy, but I think Amazon did something about this shortly after the release.  When I first got it I could use it for only about 4 hours before it needed charging!  I got crazy about making sure the wifi was always off unless I was actually using it, but that seemed to only modestly improve the battery life.  But after several weeks with the device \"something\" seemed to have changed, and now battery life is past the promised 8 hours, particularly if I'm careful about not keeping the wifi turned on 24/7.  If you are a K3 owner I'm sure you're accustomed to your K3 going week or weeks without a charge needed, but remember we're talking COLOR and CAPABLE of so much more here.  My iPad at work seems to only last about a day if I keep it on, too.  I've just gotten in the habit of plugging the Fire in first thing in the morning.  It recharges quickly - no more than an hour for a recharge.HOME BUTTON?  I don't understand the criticism about this AT ALL.  Yes, the ipad has a single home button on the front of the unit, and on the Fire you have to touch the little HOME icon to get home....  And?  Seriously, people?POWER BUTTON.  The power button the Fire is basically in the same location as on previous Kindles... so what's the issue here?  I've read people complaining about turning it off accidentally?  I have my Fire in a cover and I literally can't imagine how I might accidentally turn it off.OVERALL, I am EXCESSIVELY PLEASED with my Fire.  Some people criticize it for it's size compared to the iPad, but for me the size is a plus - it makes it very portable, very easy to stick in my purse or jacket, even in a full leather cover, to take with me to those places like a doctor's office or ANY place you might find yourself having to wait a while.  Much more transportable than the iPad.  I'm so glad I didn't spring for the iPad at more than twice the cost.... there's so little difference in functionality that it's just not worth it.  Granted, I am primarily a READER and not a consumer of media and such.  I've barely played with those functions on the Fire, except for the music side.  But the Fire is a definite leap forward for Amazon.  I love it, I recommend it to everyone I know and at work (I'm in the I.T. department) there are at least a half dozen of us who all have Fires now.

I have been more than pleased with these Kfs and I have been recommending them to my friends. Instead of looking at a $500 price tag (iPad,) the KF at $199 is wonderful and I love all the  books, apps, movies, TV shows, periodicals and other perks.

I teach online classes and had no problem even accessing that on the KF. I have made Ebay purchases and of course Amazon purchases and can see little difference from using my Apple computer. I think the KF is awesome and I have not regretted my decision one bit. I'm guessing my grandson will love it as well, I took my KF to an activity where there would be lots of grade and middle school kids and everyone who played with it was impressed and was asking lots of questions as to where they could buy one and how much it cost.

Purchasing music on my Kindle has replaced iTunes in my life (full disclosure, I didn't love iTunes to start with)--Great integration with the Kindle Store - Having shopped using my K3, the Fire experience is much easier to peruse offerings with.--Prime streaming video works beautifully.  As a stereotypically demanding consumer I'd love more offerings for Prime Streaming, but what is offered met my needs well enough that I canceled Netflix.--Comixology app is a very intuitive way to interact with comics.  I haven't read any graphic novels or comics in years, but I sampled a few of the free offerings in this service and the panel zoom feature was amazing.  I do wish the purchases in the Comics app were tied to my Amazon account (instead of a 3rd party account).--The Silk browser has actually handled everything I've thrown at it so far, better than my iPhone.  I haven't encountered any issues at all with it, and it seems responsive to me.Cons:--I wish Amazon comics/graphic novel integrated with (or had features of) the Comixology app.  I purchased The Watchmen from the Kindle store and some of the text was difficult to read without the ability to zoom into panels.--I would like hard buttons for volume controls.--I wish the Amazon App store was more inclusive of the Android Marketplace.  There are several apps that I would like that exist on the iPhone App Store and teh Android Marketplace but not in the Amazon store.Conclusion: I received my Fire on launch day and I'm still happy with it.  I use it as a mobile web browser/email reader more than an ebook reader.

When I purchased it, and yes, I own it, unlike some people who feel free to review it poorly without actually using it, I understood it would not be an iPad 2, which costs much, much more.  I knew it wouldn't provide me with free 3G, or even the opportunity to subscribe to a 3G plan.  I knew it's onboard storage was limited, so understood I'd need to manage what I kept downloaded to my Fire.I'm delighted.  For the price, it meets my relatively limited needs perfectly.  I've experienced none of the issues I read about in the press.  And as far as usability, I really wish the trade press would stop citing the person who released a study (his name is Neilson I think, though not *the Neilson, which does much more respectable surveys) which is based on a sample of four.  Yes, four people.I'm a sample of one, and 100% of this sample has had no difficulty using this delightful device.

It is standard Amazon frustration-free packaging; just pull a tabbie on the end and it pops open with zero problems. Inside the box you'll find the Fire itself, an AC adapter, and a little cardboard cut-out that explains extremely basic setup.PHYSICAL IMPRESSIONSThe Fire is heavier than I expected, but fits in the hand well. It's relatively thick compared to, say, an iPhone or iPad, but I barely notice it even though I've used many other devices. The Fire does lack both physical volume buttons and a home button, but I've not yet been annoyed by their absence after almost a month of constant use.SETUPSetup takes approximately 10 minutes at the most. Find a Wifi network, enter your credentials for your Amazon account, and you're ready to go. All digital purchases will be listed, ready to be downloaded for offline enjoyment at any time, and your one-month trial of Amazon Prime will start immediately.INTERFACEThe interface is one heck of a lot easier to use than some of the others out there. Amazon has reduced the number of steps it takes to get to whatever it is you want to get back to, whether that be Fruit Ninja, the last season of Pushing Daisies, or flicking through your current read. All of the latest items are at the front of the carousel, prominently placed on the home page of the Kindle, and you can bookmark any of them underneath the carousel for easy access.The Cloud access for any media is also easily set up. There are two views for any sub-category of content (listed across the top of the device -- Books, Video, Docs, etc): Device and Cloud. Items under the Device sub-category have been downloaded to the device for offline enjoyment. Items in the Cloud sub-category are stores on Amazon's servers to be downloaded when you have a wifi connection and want to enjoy them.The Silk browser was widely touted by Amazon, but I have not had much opportunity to use it, as my usage patterns have been mostly in the direction of video and books. Other reviewers can give a much more comprehensive review, but I have found through my occasional usage that it tends to be more speedy than the iPad was, though not enough to be truly noticable.READING EXPERIENCEThe reading experience on the Fire is much better than I expected it to be. Reading on other backlit devices has been frustrating -- the devices were either too small (iPhone) or too big (iPad) for it to be comfortable. The 7\" screen of the Fire fits a good middle point, at just large enough to be comparable to a hardcover book. The backlighting is a downside, but not everyone finds it difficult on the eyes. For me, if I keep reading sessions under two hours, I have zero problems.VIDEONetflix looks fantastic on the device, and Amazon Prime gives a fantastic expansion of Netflix's offerings. If you're into older TV shows or things like that, Amazon Prime tends to have more seasons than Netflix. I've found it worth the payment, but do use the month trial to see how it works for you.APPSApps range from fantastic to a little buggy. Frequently they go on sale, and one each day is offered for free that is usually pay-only. Games that require a lot of graphics usage generally run fine, but occasionally run into hiccups. Apps like Read It Later that allow you to pull content from the internet and such have not seemed to give me any problems, nor has Netflix. Facebook is built in, but I have chosen not to use it, because...well, do I really need another Facebook box?OVERVIEWAll in all, I wound up keeping the Fire as my sole tablet solution. If it fits your usage patterns -- which is to say, mostly consuming content -- then it's a fantastic little device that's going to run you less money than most competitors. If you're looking for something more advanced, pass over the Fire and look at the other options on the market.", "Date": "December 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Antenna warning/customer service warning", "Author": "H.

I watched  a movie. I browsed the web.  I downloaded a game.  I relished the lightweight sleek design.Then I moved to a room that was more than ten feet from my wireless router.  My Kindle fire became just an overpriced reader, because the connection (at 15 feet!) was so tenuous that nothing that needed an internet signal could be used.All the hours spent on discussion boards, all the attempts at resets and reboots and moving of the router... ...all to no avail.  My call to customer service was equally as frustrating.  The CS rep was clearly working from a script and, since Amazon's script didn't include any acknowledgement that there could be a design flaw (which MANY frustrated buyers have reported in hindsight, I now see...) having to do with the antenna, I was simply told, in the end, \"Thank you for letting us know.  We will report your issue to the development department.\"  No offer to replace.  No suggestion of what to do, at all.  The implication seemed to be that I should be content with the ten foot reception range.Really, Amazon?  Really?

I purchased the Kindle Touch and then the Fire.  I didn't buy the Fire for anything other than really being able to read in the dark without an extrnal light and it's ability to read comics.  I am impressed with how it surfs the web, as I've used that feature about 2 times.  I love the Fire for what I bought it for, the night reading is excellent because it's backlit.  It syncs really fast, much faster than the Touch.  I couldn't be happier with my Fire.  To cover all my bases, I have the Kindle Touch for daytime reading, Fire for nightime and graphic novels, and getting a Nook Tablet for all the other graphic novels I can't get on the Fire.My only complaint about the Fire, I have some trouble holding it, it's slick and if you get too close on the edges you either bring up the menu or turn the page when you don't want too.  To fix this I've ordered a new case for it so I have something else to hold onto and won't be touching things I shouldn't by accident.  And it's a little heavy, but compared to the Kindle Touch everything is heavy.  Once I have a case for it that I can hold to read, this problem will be fixed.

It's Amazon's way of competing with the iPad.No, this isn't an iPad killer, but it wasn't designed to be an iPad killer.  Let me put it this way, the iPad has been been designed for productivity and multimedia.  This device is designed just for multimedia, with most of the focus on reading.Compared to the iPad, this has a similar store structure but much more streamlined.  With Amazon Prime (you get a month trial instantly, $79.99/yr) you get so many options for \"free\".  That's under $7/mo, you get thousands of books, shows, and movies right on the device.  I've never been a fan of subscriptions, but if you like reading it's pretty awesome.  The free movies/shows may not compete with Netflix by a long shot, but I've got to admit I was blown away by the selection.  It's really easy to find free content for subscribers and it feels like shopping for books/shows/movies without the cost, it's all bundled into your subscription.Even more amazing, I had gotten a game for free as a promotion on my phone.  That game remained in my account and I could install it right on my Kindle Fire.  That was a nice, unexpected, treat.This is also a device I'd feel safe giving my to Mom or Grandparents.  It's just easy to use, I've toyed around with the nook tablet and it just doesn't have that same ease of use.  The Kindle Fire reminds me of a book, the way it should be, and that makes it so much more pleasant to use.  This is Android but it doesn't feel like Android, it doesn't feel like a whole new \"PC\" experience, it feels like the next generation of a book.

I have never had an e-reader, never a tablet of any kind, and I have never even used my cell phone for texting or email.I was pretty much an idiot when it came to this sort of product, so I spent a few weeks researching. In the beginning of my research, I even had to look up what 3G meant! I looked at the Nook, the Samsung Galaxy, and even considered an Ipad. I was torn because I mainly wanted the convenience of having tons of books in a small device, yet I have a small business and also need to be able to check email when I travel (which is seldom).I chose the Kindle Fire over the Nook, mainly because I am already an Amazon Prime member and I like shopping Amazon. I chose the Fire over the other Kindles for the email feature, the color graphics, and all the other extras that I may or may not use. (Even though reviews on techno sites recommend other products w/the E-ink screen for those whose main purpose is reading.) I chose the Kindle Fire over the Galaxy Tab because of price point. And although I knew the Fire wouldn't have all the features of the Ipad, I chose the Kindle because I didn't want to pay for an Ipad, especially when I don't really need one.So I just received the Kindle Fire a few hours ago. With the device came a charging cord, and a small instruction card showing how to charge and turn on the device. The actual manual is on the Kindle. Knowing I was going to order a Kindle, I had already purchased several Kindle books that were stored on the Cloud server. When I turned on the Kindle, my wi-fi connection was listed, so I clicked to connect it. Then it confirmed my name (without me entering it), and registered the product for me. Then when I clicked on the book tab, all my Kindle books that I had ordered were already there! Yes I expected them to be, but I still thought it was pretty cool.I used it while it was charging because I couldn't make myself wait. (It seemed to be done charging after about an hour.) I just played around with it and easily found how to set the type size larger, and the color to sepia which is a little easier on my eyes. And by adjusting the brightness the screen looks just like a book page to me, despite the comparisons saying that the lighted screen is harder on the eyes. I don't have the E-ink to compare this to, but I can say that I am very pleasantly surprised at the readability of the screen. It is WAY better than my laptop screen.I have already set my email up and it works like a charm. The on screen keyboard is surprisingly doable. I don't have the standard gmail, yahoo, etc email. I use one from my ISP in my little town, and it works just fine on the Kindle. My biggest surprise was how easy it is to browse the internet. You can google anything, I didn't realize how simple that would be. Some sites can be hard to read, but that's ok, I don't plan to use this for a computer. I was very happy with the Weather.com app though. Very readable and easier to use than the regular site on my laptop, because it's minus all the crap. On the Kindle, you just punch in any location, and you get quick, clear info that you can customize.I don't think I'll watch movies much on this, (why would I, when I have a great big Samsung tv?). But it's a nice feature that I may find useful on long trips.All in all this magical little rectangle is great. There are apps that were not really selling points for me, but after browsing them I can see possibilities!I only have one negative so far. When I am reading a book page, I find it difficult to get the little 'home' icon to pop up so I can get out. I have figured out what I am Supposed to do, it just doesn't seem to work very well. Maybe there are other ways to get off of a book page and back to the menu, but for now I am blaming my own lack of 'finger-finesse', and hope that I will get better at this soon. All in all I am very happy with this and look forward to spending a lot of time using it.12/9/11 Addition: One day later and as expected, the last paragraph above shows my lack of finesse, rather than anything wrong with the touch screen. I am already getting a lot better at making the Home icon to appear.", "Date": "December 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "love my kindle fire", "Author": "B.

Plumey", "ReviewID": "RQWVWKCX44BQF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was very hesitant to buy the Kindle Fire. I was a happy nook Color owner and still own an Apple iPad. I didn't need a high end tablet, since I already had one. What I wanted was a high quality LCD reading device that made it easy to get to content, primarily books but not limited to them. The nook Color worked just fine but I am very much tied to the Amazon store. My wife has a kindle (2nd generation) and we've purchased hundreds of books from Amazon. Getting these books onto my nook Color involved rooting, modding, and otherwise customizing the nook Color.It was a major pain in the rear.Enter the Kindle Fire.So far, I have immensely enjoyed the Kindle Fire. I turned on the device, registered, and was prompted to download an update (no pc required). After updating, I saw that several of my recently purchased books were already sitting in the carousel. That's exactly what I was looking for. No rooting, modding, and hacking my way to my Kindle books. It's not a perfect device but it works very well for what I do with it: read books, surf the web occasionally, and play just a few games.Hardware:The device is very well built and feels solid. I feel like there could be a slightly wider bevel around the screen but it's not uncomfortable to hold. The screen is fantastic, but even at its lowest brightness it is still a little too bright for blackout bed reading. To get around that I installed an app called Screen Filter which lowers the brightness of text just a little bit more. The speakers are not that great but the headphone jack produces very good sound. I've played a few CPU-intensive games and they all seem to work great--much better than on the nook Color, which is expected given the Kindle Fire's hardware. Some reviews have complained that there are no hardware buttons on the device. I can see their point, but I don't change the volume on the device often enough to need a dedicated button. I would like to see a home button that also acts as a launcher to an app switcher. Right now, switching between reading a book, the browser, or an app takes too many taps.Software:There are a few rough edges that Amazon needs to smoothe out but, overall, the software on the Kindle Fire is very good for a first release. In fact, Amazon have already put out two updates since I bought the Kindle Fire.  The reading app is missing some key features, such as page numbers and the sharing features, but I'm sure they'll come soon enough. Page turns are smooth except when not connected to a wireless network. For some reason, and this may just be my impression, the animation stutters a bit when I'm not connected. I've already used the built-in feedback app on the Kindle Fire to report this.My biggest complaint about the Kindle Fire software, is the carousel. Amazon meant well but it's not executed very well. There's no way to filter out content or even to manually hide items from the carousel. It was meant to be a quick way to access recent content, and in a sense that's true, but it also shows all of the cloud content purchased on your account. So if you share an account with your spouse, you will see all of your spouse's purchases in the carousel. I think a software update that allows you to control what the content displays will go a long way to making it more useful.So, overall, I am very happy with my purchase. I would recommend the Kindle Fire to anyone who wants an LCD reading device that can also handle music, video, the web, and simple apps.

I have a chronic condition that makes holding books painful, so the last few years I haven't really been able to read as much as I would like. In high school I would weekly bring home a tall stack of books. When I found the kindle app for my iphone I was super excited. It worked but I missed the larger page size. So I got a 2nd generation kindle. I loved the size but had 2 drawbacks. One, I missed having a touchscreen as sadly my phone had me spoiler. Two, as much as I loved the e-ink, I needed to be able yo read without a light. Enter the Fire. I had been seriously considering an ipad but mentally I couldn't justify the price for what I was going to use it for. And that was a key point for me. The Fire was able to do all that I needed it to do anlod more with a price that I felt was reasonable considering its features. Now I'm able to again enjoy an activity that I dearly loveplus be able to do additional things. I have a horrible memory so it's helpful to be reading but then pop over to a web page to look something up, order something, or check on pending items. Being able to stream or download videos is really nice. I haven't played any games or used any apps other than Pandora.Now I will also say that I know the Fire isn't perfect. The touchscreen can be a little off as to where I was trying to select. The autocorrect can be weirder than the iphone on some of its suggestions and I really didn't think that was possible. No external volume control is frustrating. It weighs more than you would think for the size but it's just a matter of propping it up rather than just holding it.Overall it lives up to all my expectations. I don't feel that it's trying to go feature to feature with the ipad. Amazon has been upfront as to what features the Fire has and I feel that it does those things really well. For me it was a matter of deciding what was I really going to use it for, how often, and was the price justified based on the answers to the previous two questions. For me the Fire has all the features I was looking for and had a price that was reasonable for those features.", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "It's Good...

The fire lives up to its expectations.There are a few things I've noticed.- It will fit in a jacket pocket. Or a trouser pocket. Try doing that with that tablet that starts with an 'I' and rhymes with 'sad' :)- You NEED to have a credit card on file with Amazon, even if you're just getting free stuff. Even if you just use gift cards, you still need a CC on file.- YouTube works. Flash works. Google Music works.- It's very, very easy to purchase books / music / apps. Sometimes TOO easy. Tap one button and it automatically downloads and charges your credit card on file. This can be a problem if you download the wrong item, or too many items by mistake. This can probably be worked around by using a prepaid debit card for the file, and gift cards for purchases.- You can buy (or get) from the Amazon website, or right on the Fire. Purchases from the website go straight to the cloud. Purchases on the Fire are automatically downloaded.- If you get everything directly from Amazon the Fire works wonderfully. You'll never need to plug the Fire into a computer at all. You can remote manage it from any browser, and it will update your Fire even if it's 200 miles away :)- You CAN sideload music, books, and apps. There's no cable included so you need to get a MICRO USB cable to connect to a computer. It's smaller than the Mini-USB that's been around for a few years.- Sideloading eBooks: Watch the file format of the ebook. Mobi files give the best results, with text flow, resizing, and remembering your place. TXT and XLS files will open in another program on the Fire (like Office). This program will NOT remember your place on TXT files, so this can be an issue if you're reading a novel-length file.When downloading a file from the Silk browser, the Fire won't be able to read it until you move it out of the 'downloads' folder. This is probably the only time you'd need to connect the Fire to a computer.

I've had a subscription for Nat Geo for some time on my Kindle keyboard, but when I saw it on the Fire, I was amazed.

Purchased the KF for my wife and daughter. My wife is a dedicated Kindle owner and our seven year old loves the iPad. I hoped that the Kindle Fire would relieve some of the demand on the iPad and provide an alternative to the \"lights on in the bedroom\" requirement for wife's nighttime reading. I knew that it wouldn't equal the functionality of the iPad but hoped that it might give us up to 80% of the functionality at 40% (or less) of the price. Long story short, the KF is great!Though it's clear that the KF isn't a substitute for the iPad, it's a great complement. Some pros and cons.() Set Up. What a joy! Sixty seconds to take the KF out of the box. Thirty minutes to give it a full charge. Three minutes to configure it with my wife's Amazon account already assigned to the device. Another 60 seconds to test the wifi with our home network and my portable wifi hotspot. Done. An hour or two to add apps from the Amazon Android store and get acquainted. Purposely avoided sideloading and rooting though I'm quite familiar with the procedure. It's my wife's KF and I don't want to spend time managing it in addition to the other five computers/tablets/smartphones in the household.() Form Factor. The screen is half the size of the iPad. Makes for more \"scoping\" on many web pages but the KF also weighs 30% less than the iPad, fits easily in my wife's purse, slides easily into my briefcase without special accommodations, and is considerably easier for my daughter to handle. Far superior to our smartphones for handling email and almost as easy to carry around. Heavy compared to my wife's beloved Kindle but just takes a bit of \"getting used to.\"() Wifi Only Constaints. The many complaints about the absence of 3G support don't affect us. I have a 4G/LTE mobile hotspot that I need for my laptop, iPad, and sometimes for my Android smartphone when I travel. The mobile hotspot (which Verizon now calls a \"Jet Pack\") links flawlessly with the KF when our home wifi network is unavailable. If unlimited access to the internet is a priority, tethering to a smartphone or hotspot works like a charm. And in our case, it provides much, much better performance than 3G for up to five devices at a time. No need (or desire) for still another overpriced data plan for the KF when I already pay for cell-based internet access on other devices.() Performance. I strongly suspect that many of the complaints about performance can be traced to wifi router and internet access issues in home networks. In our case, our up-to-date router and cable-based broadband connection is reliable, easy to access, and very, very fast. Same story for the mobile hotspot. The KF found (and continues to find) available networks easily from day one.A very minor \"con\" is the responsiveness of the Carousel. A number of reviewers have noted unpredictability and \"jumpiness\" in using the carousel. I suspect that stems from relying on quick \"swipes\" rather than deliberate touching of the stacked apps. The designers may have erred in encouraging swiping with the carousel metaphor in the UI.Web performance is a bit puzzling. Some pages load very quickly; others appear to hang. Still experimenting with the Silk browser \"acceleration\" to determine whether that is a factor. On the whole, I'd give the iPad a higher score for web browsing the support for Flash on some websites is a definite plus for the KF.() The Bookcase User Interface. With the last 6.2.1 OS update users can remove items from the Carousel. I can understand why early adopters found the inability to clear the Carousel was frustrating and the option to remove items is welcome. But I would still prefer an \"opt in\" rather than an \"opt out\" option to place items on the Carousel. I find that about 80% of the time I end up deleting apps I've recently used from the carousel. I'd much rather be proactive about keeping them than deleting them.I do miss the greater customization available in many Android devices but frankly, the rigid constraints of the KF's user interface are really no worse than those imposed on the iPad. Just different. I haven't explored rooting the KF but I suspect that those who long for greater UI customization may find it a worthwhile option. Just keep in mind that \"rooting\" opens the door to more involved system administration tasks and requires at least a rudimentary understanding of how the Android OS works.() Parental Control. A hot button issue for many folks. Even with the initial updates weaknesses remain. But frankly, the KF is superior to the iPad in some ways on this score. I've added an app (Kids Place) that effectively provides a sandbox for my daughter's apps. Once she opens \"Kids Place\" on the favorites shelf her apps are readily available and she cannot access the other apps and content on the KF. No such feature exists for the iPad. None. Nada. Apple's \"workaround\" is a simple one. Buy your kid another iPad. I was frankly surprised to see that the KF is miles ahead of Apple on this score.The features can be improved, of course. I know of no way to categorize and segregate content such as books for my daughter. And if web access is provided within Kids Place, there is no way (I've found) to restrict that access to particular web sites. But the features available (including control over \"1-Click\" purchases) go a long way toward providing a safe environment for my daughter (and my bank account.)() Hardware Issues. Yes, the power button is in the wrong place and simply flipping the device is a PITA workaround that fails to deal with the problem adequately. Likewise the placement of the headphone jack is problematic. I suspect that cramming components into the device trumped usability issues. The speaker is terrible. Should not be news to anyone accustomed to this device class. Good news is that speakers or headphones make up for the native audio inadequacy. I have a pair of iHome speakers purchased from Amazon for the iPad that provide great sound for less than $50. A set of Sennheiser PX100-II portable headphones, also from Amazon complete the audio package.() Overall Assessment. Would I trade my iPad for the KF? Of course not. But I wouldn't trade my laptop for the iPad, either. If you want virtually unlimited functionality, you pay for it in terms of portability and purchase price.If I didn't have the iPad would I purchase a KF instead? Probably not. But that's because the iPad (despite some important limitations) has replaced a small notebook I've used for air travel. The KF can't quite take its place in terms of functionality or local storage. I do quite a bit of content creation on the iPad and a companion bluetooth keyboard. That's simply impossible on the KF. Those with less demanding requirements may draw a different conclusion.Finally, would I replace the KF with an iPad as a second tablet in the family? Absolutely NOT. At 40% of the price of a wifi only iPad, it is a GREAT alternative. For books and movies it's an excellent personal device, nearly the equal of the iPad. What it lacks in content creation functionality and the oft-cited massive number of iPad apps, it more than compensates for in terms of portability and overall quality.Others may see the KF as an option for the new tablet user. I see it as an excellent companion for an iPad in a multi-user household.", "Date": "January 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Exceeds expectations, and expectations were high!", "Author": "c'mon man", "ReviewID": "R1BAG2ND1QMZ6Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am 15, just so you know somewhat who is talking to you.

Let's get to the review. . .Pre-Kindle era:As soon as this was announced, I knew this had very much potential to steal my heart. I am a heavy amazon user, and have been a fan of the site for awhile. I like reading books, so I've flirted with the idea of getting the Kindle 3G, but couldn't convince myself that I wanted a device just for reading books, since I also enjoy movies, tv, games, web browsing, etc. I asked for this for Christmas as soon as it came out basically, up to Christmas day I had read numerous reviews, mainly from this site specifically. There are obviously a lot of not so great reviews. But there are a lot more good reviews then bad, so this didn't worry me too much. Now my review. . .Expectations (and how they were/were not fulfilled):E-Books- my expectations on this were fairly low, because I assumed that reading large portions of a book on this would be fairly uncomfortable due to the fact that it is a normal computer screen. It wasn't a big deal because I was only a moderate reader anyway. My expectations were far exceeded because I have found that the screen is extremely comfortable to look at even for long durations (for my eyes, that is). I am currently reading the Bio of Steve Jobs and have enjoyed the experience very much due to the comfort and convenience.Movies/TV- I figured it would be pretty good for watching movies and tv. I thought it'd not necassarily be awe-inspiring, but good. Well in this it also exceeded expectations, as the quality of the screen is EXCELLENT and watching episodes of 24 has been extremely gratifying.Movie/TV selection (VIA AMAZON PRIME)- This TV and movie selection exceeded and did not meet my expectations, respectively. The TV series that are on this I find very numerous and plentiful. Which I find with great delight. The free movies however, tend to be old or insignificant, many I find that I do not even know because they're so. . . I don't know, insignificant. But it does have very cheap rentals which I love, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, which just came out, is only $2 dollars to rent for two days, which I am very happy with. So as you can see, this exceeded and fell below my expectations at the same time. But overall I am happy.Games- the game selection is great, as I expected. Many a game have I downloaded and enjoyed so far. The app selection overall is pretty nice.Web browsing- Web browsing is simple and nice. Starts out a little slower but the browser was designed to learn, and that's what it does, it gets faster every time you use it. So pleased here.Conclusion- Overall, it exceeded my already high expectations, and honestly I couldn't be much happier with this!I am a very techy teenager and love my smartphones and tablets, this one is a keeper.", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Five stars in consideration of its price", "Author": "LisaMaine \"Lynette in Wisconsin\"", "ReviewID": "RHZJ9L9BWYKYP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Kindle Fire is never going to replace your laptop, even when traveling; it's just too limited for that.

After reading a lot of wailing about how hard it is to get the Fire to connect to WiFi I was very nearly scared off. Thank goodness I gave it a try. I didn't even HAVE a WiFi setup in my home. So I read and read and read till I determined what I thought would best serve my needs (the Netgear WNDR3700v2)Ordered it from Amazon, and with trepidation began setting it up. It was so easy to do, even for a 66 yr old non techie like me. Then my next hold my breath moment was turning on the Kindle Fire, because I thought for sure it would be a real hassle to get the thing to recognize the WiFi. HA and HA again! The first thing I saw was the connection, and a request to enter my password. TA DAH!!Registered the new Fire, and voila, there were all my books (I have a 3G keyboard Kindle too). What fun then to browse the App store and choose some fun fun fun games and applications. Then I settled in to do what I most wanted the Fire for anyway....free movies through Amazon Prime. Never would pay for Showtime to see the few things on there I was interested in (The Tudors) but I can watch all the episodes for free now!BTW, if you aren't a Prime member already I just want to say it is SO worth the price. The savings on shipping alone are worth the membership, if you ever mail things to friends and family in another part of the US. Example: I just mailed 3 Christmas gifts to family about 1200 miles from me. Cost was $45.56. HELLO...Prime membership is $79/yr. If Amazon offered homemade cookies etc, I could have saved that $45.56! But really, I probably mail things 6-7 times a year directly from Amazon to family in Florida. Ka-Ching. Then there is all the postage I DON'T HAVE TO PAY on things I order that are not small items, like furnace filters, a vacuum sweeper, etc. Ok, sorry for the digression, this is supposed to be about the Fire.Colors are stunning, device is beautiful, sound quality is very good, and I am thrilled with my purchase. It is just right for me, but I can understand that for those who need/want more power in a tablet, the iPad may be the only thing that satisfies. To wind up, it was easy to get set up, things are working perfectly so far, and I am a happy happy camper.", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "A couple of tips for new users", "Author": "Local Resident", "ReviewID": "RDXYCXD1MMHF5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After 3 weeks I can say that my Kindle Fire does everything I expected very well - media consumption (mostly books and magazines for me)and checking email, a few news sites and Google.  I don't have an iPad or another Kindle so I can't compare them.  I do have a Pandigital Novel bought early in 2011 at Costco for a similar price to the Fire.  The Pandigital Novel (you can check it out here on Amazon) offers similar features to the Fire but for epub books - but is significantly inferior.  I find the Fire to have a much more readable screen, much better touch response and more intuitive (like Apple devices) to use.  As many have said, the Fire isn't an iPad but is much better than other $200 devices.A couple of tips:It is very easy to inadvertently touch the on-off button on the bottom of the device when holding it in your hand or resting it on something.  Simply turn the device upside down with the button at the top.  Everything (except for the initial screen saver) flips over and you can continue to read without accidently turning off the Fire.Unlike my Apple and Samsung smartphones, the Fire charges very slowly or not at all on a normal low powered computer USB port. (Probably the bigger Fire screen needs more power.)  The included plug in charger works fine - takes a couple of hours at most.  The plug in  and car micro USB chargers from my Samsung also work overnight.  If you are used to charging your devices from your laptop USB ports, you will need to pack a charger if travelling with your Fire.  I'm getting more than the advertised 8 hours use per charge but I have the brightness set lower than default.", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Give it a Chance!", "Author": "B.

An hour into charging, I decided to turn it on & show it to my hubby, who bought it for me as an early Christmas gift. The touch screen response was awful and it took many tries to enter my WiFi pass code. The carousel was out of control. And then I saw that it was trying to update the software. Once I actually let the update happen (all of 2 minutes, maybe), the KF worked like a charm, and it has worked wonderfully ever since.I had been reading the reviews (mostly good, but a few complaints) and I wasn't sure what to expect. I found that it was easy to set up and use. The only setting up was connecting to my WiFi connection, because it arrived with my account settings loaded. Awesome!I consider myself somewhat tech savvy and I can troubleshoot some complicated things. The KF just works - my books, apps, music & videos download just fine. My purchases work. The picture is AMAZING! I can view docs and pictures. The carousel is fine.To me, the Silk browser works great! I don't have patience when the internet takes a long time, so I would have noticed lag times. I've done searches, online banking, downloads, etc. No issues. Web pages load very quickly, even the first time. Syncing is quick, as with the Kindle.I can't imagine it not working once the update is finished, almost right out of the box, as some have stated. Did those who complain & return the KF allow it to charge and update properly? I'm sure defective machines are made, but it just worked for me.

My husband MUST order TWO more LOL!", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "My first week with the kindle fire", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R146F3U1K0OXL8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ok a little background first. When I first heard about the kindle fire I was pretty excited about it's possibilities, but I held off on preordering because I'm kind of a techie guy and I wanted to get my hands on the device and see if it fits right for me. I was also on the fence for a whole year as far as needing a tablet in my life at all. I was impressed with the ipad, acer iconia, and, toshiba thrive but I wasn't willing to pay $300 to $500 for something I was only going to use to check my email, browse the web, and some light gaming. My fear was that it would be collecting dust eventually.So, after my pros and cons, I'm going to put up something that I didn't see that often in a review or description: a normal day of usage with this device. I'm hoping it will help someone in their decision.PROS:Size and weight - I questioned the size and form factor at first because I was focused on getting an 8 to 10 inch tablet. But once I had it in my hands it felt surprisingly comfortable to hold and even more important, it fit into my pocket without anyone noticing it there. I loved that.Content organization - It's extremely easy to get to where I want to go. Navigation of the device made it easy to show off to my friends interested in knowing more about it and when I needed to do something, I didn't have to take a lot of time remembering where it was. It was always right in front of me.Email - I liked the convinience of checking all my emails at once in my email client. That's one of my main uses for opening my laptop at home nowadays. Now, I barely opened it this week. More on that later.Amazon Prime - Streaming videos and watching videos was a BIG deciding factor for me. Before I purchased the fire I bought season 1 of Avatar the Last Air Bender on amazon and stored it in the cloud. The moment I registered my device (bought it in best buy), it was available to me. I loved storing my songs in the cloud and the ease of access to that content really made me fall in love with this device. And also, 6.5 gigs of space was plenty for me. I downloaded an album, 4 episodes of avatar, and a 2 hour movie, and still had roughly 4 gigs left. Management is the key because they won't stay on there.Android Workarounds - This is a huge pro for me too. Although amazon has locked down the content, because it's android, there's always a workaround. The ability to sideload apps either by email or usb has made me fall in love with this device AGAIN. I have games Cordy and even the great Shadowgun running on my fire, and I didn't even root it yet. This really opens up the possibilities for what I will do with my fire in the future.CONS:Weight - At times it does feel a little heavy, esspecially when reading. I'd hold it in one hand and have to switch sometimes. And that weight can get to you at times when it's in your pocket.Touch sensitivity - When going through the recent items, I sometimes have to go to it multiple times in order to select it. And when I get there the touch doesn't always register the first time. That gets annoying.Glare - When it's in direct sunlight, it's pretty tough to see the screen.Power button - Many people has said this in other reviews and I agree, the placement of the power button makes it cut off sometimes accidentally. You should be mindful of that.App selection - There are some apps I wish amazon had in their app store that are in google's app store. If I can side load it, it should be available. Also, updates to apps don't come at the same frequency as google. That's bothereome.BOTH PRO AND CON:Ease of shopping - I'm sure that was the main goal with this device and they've done a great job with that. I've spent so much money at amazon since I've got this device, from apps to music to videos. So, I have to be VERY careful when it comes to that. It's an impulse shopper's worst nightmare. Lol!!!So, as you can see, after a week of usage, the pros outweigh the cons, thus why I gave it 5 stars. It you're looking for content consumption, this is the device for you. I really wanted to know if I could live my life without opening my personal laptop. And since I've uploaded a lot of my music and content to the cloud, I barely use it now. And for my lifestyle, THAT is what I wanted and needed in a tablet. Missing accomplished. :)So here is my typical day of usage with the kindle fire. I hope this gives a good picture of seeing if it fits in your life:I wake up and after my workout, I check the weather channel app on my fire to see what to wear. As I'm ironing I either listen to music or watch a video on it. Once I'm done, and I'm eating breakfast, I'm reading the news in the pulse reader app, checking my email, and then downloading whatever stuff I need from the cloud for that day. Most likely an episode of avatar to watch while I'm sitting in traffic.I get in my car and listen to some music tracks I stored on my device. I get to work, and since I have computers there, I don't use it much outside of playing a game when I have to go to the bathroom for a while, which my coworkers won't know, since it fits into my pocket so conviently. Then, on my lunch break, while I'm eating, I'm reading a book or reading a comic book I downloaded for the comixology app.After finishing out the work day, sure enough I run into traffic. So, as I sit, I watch an episode of avatar on my fire. I get home I plop on my couch, turn on netflix on my ps3, and watch something. As I'm doing that, on my fire I'm checking my email, checking my facebook, and looking up more info on my fire or other things (yeah I do all that while netflix is on...lol). Then I take a quick look at the weather for tommorow as I head to bed. Before I go to sleep, I get in a quick round of shadowgun. Then, I go to sleep. The end. :)Lastly..this entire review was written on my kindle fire...;) Yeah, the typing is cool too...lol!", "Date": "November 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "At $199 you are practically stealing this", "Author": "James Burns", "ReviewID": "R2DDZT6NE26VCD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is not a souped up e-reader, its a high quality Android tablet.

It is a gorgeous device. All of my Kindle content was there waiting for me as soon as I opened it up, as well as my music that I've purchased from Amazon. The Kindle Fire came with a courtesy charge, so I was able to start using it as soon as I took it out of the box.I also have an iPad, and use an iPhone. Learning the Android interface is somewhat of a challenge, but it's not that much different. Mainly the keyboard input is what I've noticed the most, along with the App store being totally different from what I'm accustomed to. The touchscreen is slightly less responsive or sensitive than the screen on my Apple devices, but it is not something most people would notice.Speaking of Apple products, Apple will not allow users to watch Amazon Prime Instant Videos on iPads. This irritates me to no end, and is one of the main reasons I bought the Kindle Fire (even though I didn't \"need\" it).fyi for users of old Kindles who upgrade: the highlight and share function is not as easy to use on the Kindle Fire, if you like to highlight passages and tweet them.  When I am doing serious heavy duty reading, I will stick with my old Kindle, because I highlight passages like it's my job, and I don't like the way the highlighter works in Kindle Fire. I'm sure I'll get used to it after a while, but it's really awkward for now.I do think this device is worth every penny of the $200 I paid for it.PS: The pulse app that shows up front and center when you open the Kindle Fire, is very similar to Flipboard on the iPad.

I am posting this on our iPad 2 while my wife is reading on the Fire.  Browsing is comparable.  I do not notice any slower web page browsing on the fire.  I timed the cnn home page on each device after the browser cache was cleared and he iPad 2 loads in 5.2 seconds and the fire loads it in 5.8 seconds.  However while there is still some minor rendering being done on the iPad page, on the Fire the page renders all at once, rather instantly.  The  Pinch to zoom is smooth on both devices.  There were a couple of aps on my droid that I wanted on the kindle (Dropbox, etc.) so I sideloaded them which took less than 5 minutes... The kindle fire is way less locked than I expected!  Magazines are smooth and books are smooth.  I have no idea what people are talking about, unless they are leaving 10 or so aps running... That's why anyone experienced with android uses Advanced Task Killer periodically.I use a 4g mifi for the iPad and the Fire.  Why pay for 3g/4g on every device?I would like an SD slot on the Fire.

I'm an Amazon Prime subscriber and I uploaded my music to the Amazon cloud several months ago and use it daily to listen to my music(usually via web browser on my work PC and during runs on my phone). I watch Amazon Prime streaming videos occasionally on my Roku and I'm always reading some Kindle book using the Kindle app on either the iPad or my phone. I'm also cheap, and I consider my iPad to be a luxury item that is a nice to have rather than a need to have.So after reading my bio, you probably think I'm the perfect person for this device because I use a lot of Amazon services. I felt this way too so it was a no brainer purchase for me since my wife and I do battle for iPad usage from time to time.Web Browsing(Fire=C iPad=B) - My biggest complaint about the iPad 2 is the web browsing experience. I often find myself going upstairs to use my PC rather than deal with slow load times of the iPad. I was very excited about Silk but have been disappointed thus far. For some websites like wikipedia it seems to be extremely fast, but for more obscure websites it crawls. That being said, there is no noticeable difference between iPad and the Fire in terms of speed, but I rate the iPad higher because of its screen size. The extra couple of inches makes a big positive difference for your overall web browsing experience.Kindle(Fire=A iPad=C) - While I felt the screen size was too small for web browsing, I find the smaller size better for reading since it's a little easier on the eyes. Holding the tablet itself is better for reading as well. While the Kindle app is crippled on the iPad since you can't buy books inside the app, you can still get them onto the iPad pretty easily so I don't consider that a major advantage of the Fire.Amazon Cloud Music(Fire=A iPad=D) - You can listen to Amazon Cloud Music on the iPad via Safari Mobile browser but that is not ideal. With the Fire the integration is what you'd expect. That being said, listening to music on the iPad or Fire is not something I do or plan to do very often, if at all. I use my phone for that.Videos(Fire=B iPad=B-) - I'm not comparing the Amazon service like I did with music because you can't get Amazon Prime videos to stream on the iPad. However, you can stream Netflix and Hulu on either device. With the iPad you have access to iTunes, though I think you have to download videos to the iPad rather than stream, which is why I give the Fire the slight edge here. Note that my lack of knowledge on this is because it's another thing I rarely do on a tablet.Apps(Fire=C iPad=B) - I'm a little disappointed by the Fire making you use their appstore, because compared to Google's Android Marketplace it is lacking in a lot of useful apps. For example, I can't find a decent Google Reader client on the Amazon App Store yet, and this is one of the main things I use the iPad for. I realize that there is a way to hack the device and side load apps, but this isn't something most people can do.Hardware(Fire=C iPad=B+) - For the most part I'm fine with the Fire but like many others I'm frustrated with the lack of a hardware volume control. It makes my desire to listen to music and watch videos dwindle to nothing. I'm sure Amazon will not make this mistake again. Otherwise I like the device, it looks good and I especially like the rubberized backing. I also like that the Fire uses a non-proprietary charging device by charging with microUSB. One less charger to pack while traveling. The iPad's charger is clunky and the connector is extremely awkward, probably its worst feature.OS(Fire=C iPad=B) - Both OS's are very simple and easy to navigate and use. Unfortunately I have to give the iPad the upper hand here because of the bugginess of the Fire. It has a lag issue where often you can't tell if you physically missed the button press or if the Fire just didn't get the button press because of lag. You'll often find yourself pressing a link or button 3 or 4 times before it actually goes where you want it to go. Another problem I have with Fire is the lack of Swype. If you ask me, the iPad is not an input device. The keyboard makes me feel like I'm on a 1920's typewriter. I consider Swype to be one of the huge advantages that Android has over IOS and Amazon failed to support it for the Fire. I hope they will consider getting this in the appstore. Outside of these issues though, I find the OS to be simple and easy to use, even simpler than iOS and that's a good thing.Battery(Fire=A iPad=A) - With either device I've never worried about the battery life. I usually charge both devices overnight every other day or so. The fact that it's never something I think about is why I give both an 'A' even though the iPad has a longer advertised battery life.Overall(Fire=B iPad=A-) - All things considered I like the Fire a lot but it still has some growing up to do. The lack of a volume button is mind boggling and Silk has been a letdown. My other complaints regarding bugginess will probably be fixed in future software updates and the appstore will undoubtedly become more robust in the near future. If you are mostly a Kindle reader and price is a big consideration for you, I don't hesitate to recommend the Fire. That being said, if money is no object and you have $499, go with the iPad.***UPDATE(12/23/2011)***Since this review Amazon has released two firmware updates just as I suspected they would. I have to say, many things have been improved thanks to these updates. The responsiveness has been drastically improved and Silk seems to be much better as well, at this point I would say it is faster than iPad 2. For people receiving this as a Christmas gift I'm sure they will not face the disappointments that we early adopters have.Another thing that I did was 'sideload' some essential apps(google reader). This was a very simple process, you do not have to root the device nor do you even need to connect the Kindle to your home computer. Just google for the .apk file and away you go. There are a few repositories of apks that make this process very very simple.As of now, the only glaring dislike is the lack of a volume button which unfortunately cannot be remedied.My overall score for these device changes as follows. Fire A- and iPad 2 A-. Considering the price these are equal devices. If the Fire were to cost $499 I would expect it to be a much more capable device than the iPad 2 is because there is that much value in the current $199 price.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "KUDOS TO THE SILK TEAM!!

The thing that has impressed me MOST about this device is the browsing speed. The Silk browser is unbelievably fast, I have not seen pages load so fast on my laptop, iPad, or any other device I have used. My impression was that the cache stored in the cloud would only be for Amazon or static web pages that don't change often. So I tried browsing through Yahoo news (which is updated probably every few minutes or hourly), and this baby FLIES!! Pages load in less than a second, unbelievable and completely awesome!! If the screen were slightly bigger, this would have been the only device I would have every browsed on. Shopping on Amazon is WAY faster on the Fire. Sorry if I'm going on and on about this, but I am truly blown away by the browser, that's the highlight of this device for me so far.Other than that, the device feels and holds great. The screen is not as smooth as the iPad or the Xoom, the finger slides a little slower on this glass compared to those devices.

The Fire doesn't have this or that, or do this or that like this tablet does or that tablet. Folks, it is a Kindle! And what is a Kindle? A Kindle is an e-reader. If you want a friggin' camera and you want thousands and thousands of apps that you'll use once and then never touch again, then go buy yourself a tablet for $500 or more. You're going to pay extra for all the other things and the question is, \"Will you really use the other stuff?\" Seriously, think about all the bells and whistles you pay extra money to have and then think about how much of it you really use. Not piddled around with once or twice, but actually really use. The Fire is a fantastic e-reader and the fact that it's color, supports apps, video, music, and the Internet is all bonus! It isn't trying to be an iPad and it doesn't need to be. It's just a more advanced e-reader. That's it. Give it a rest.The Kindle Fire is a great device. I absolutely love it.  I bought it at launch and have waited for almost a year to review it because I wanted to give a fair review. I hate it when a person reviews an electronic the same day they get it. Of course it's going to be good the first day you have it. You're excited. It's new. But will you still love it six months from now? I've had mine since it first came out and I use it everyday. I use it to read, use apps, and view the Internet, and my kids use it to play games. It gets plenty of use and the battery life is great, The Kindle has never lagged while using it to watch videos. The color is great. The books download so fast. It's a great device. My daughter just purchased one because she loves mine so much.Why didn't I give it five stars? I didn't give it five stars because like any electronic device, it isn't perfect. It does not use the e-ink technology of the other Kindles so you do get glare when reading...but you can read at night because the screen is lit. So, it's a trade off. Also, there are two ways to turn the page. One way is to simply drag your finger from left to right or vice-versa to turn the page. This method works well. The other way is to tap the far left or right side of the screen and sometimes that doesn't work. Other times while holding the device my thumb will touch the side and turn the page when I didn't want it to turn. Minor complaint. Another is that the speakers could be louder. That would probably be my biggest complaint. If you are going to add a feature, do it and do it right, otherwise just leave the feature off. The speakers on the Kindle Fire are not super...they aren't horrible...but not super either. Yes, as other reviewers have mentioned, having the power button on the bottom can be a pain. Sometimes when I am reading the Fire will shut off because I accidently pressed the power button with my thumb or palm. Yes, you can turn the Kindle upside down to rectify this trivial nuisance...but we shouldn't really have to do that, should we?

Mackley \"mysterychick\"", "ReviewID": "R3NN3OZSGYX8K0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My Kindle Fire arrived a few days after the product release date, but I waited until now to write the review. What can I say, the past seven months with this great little device has changed my life. Or at least the way I consume media and use social media. I ordered one for both me and my husand. (he's a guy who said he didn't need a stupid tablet) Neither one of us has put the Kindle Fire down since it arrived.No, it is not an iPad. But that's not what this device is intended to be. It is a nice, reasonably priced device for consuming media. I've found it to be reliable and enjoyable. I purchased the Amazon Prime and found it to be worth the price. I made that back in what I saved on shipping Christmas gifts.1. Books - Great reader. Super fast and easy as ever to buy books from Amazon. There is an almost endless supply of free e-books of classics and new authors, plus you can borrow from libraries and there is an Amazon Prime lending library for those who purchase prime. It features newer books tht stay on your device until you borrow another one and they are \"returned.\"  I find that books that feature multiple color images are much better when they apps instead of just pictures of the book. Love how kids' books work on here, especially things like the Charlie Brown Christmas App and Peter Rabit. Still, it is a lit screen and not as easy on the eyes and the e-ink reader.2. Graphic novels and comics - one of the reasons I wanted a Kindle Fire, this feature works well, even with a small screen. There were some glitches in reading the graphic novels at first, but an update took care of it. I have read graphic novels purchased through Amazon and through the ree Comixology App. Because of the size of the screen, they use a guided reading process that highlights and enlarges parts of the screen, but it works fine.3. Apps - Kindle Fire offers a free app of the day and there are some delightful things in there. But whether they are free of paid apps, I find the apps available in the Kindle App store work just fine. I use the Facebook, Twitter and several game apps and I think they work fine. I've enjoyed using the touch screen for drawing programs. I do most of my social media from my Kindle now.4. Video. The Amazon Prime video selection is pretty good. A lot of my favorite TV shows and movies as well some gems like old episodes of Julia Child. The video playback is smooth and I've never had any problems.5. Web - for the most part the web is super fast. The Silk browser really moves and I've seldoom found a site that doesn't work well. Pinch and zoom makes it easy to move in on what you need. Pictures and videos display very well.6. Magazines - the Kindle Newsstand feature intrigued me. I am not a huge fan of the magazines that are just color pictures of the magazine like Rachael Ray. They can be problematic to read. Magazines that have apps work wonderfully well. Bon Appetit is especially well done. But I hate that I have to have a paper suscription to use the app. The whole idea was to go paperless. Do check the description of the magazine. Some like National Geographic limit e-editions to only one image per article. Really? The photos are kind of the point, people.  Also be careful with enhanced books and make sure they are designed for the Kindle. Some are only optomized for an iPad. Learned that the hard way.7. Music - Music plays smoothly from my Amazon cloud. Though I'm still more apt to use an MP3 player.8. Documents - document transfer was pretty easy using the e-mail address that Amazon supplies.There is no camera - but I prefer to use the camera with my phone for snapping photos, though I guess this is a drawback if you wanted to video chat on your Kindle. I'd just use my phone.No USB port, so you will have to e-mail documents and images to yourself if you want to move them to a computer.All in all, very satisfied.", "Date": "June 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "The Kindle Tablet Fact & Fiction", "Author": "Nathaniel Reynolds", "ReviewID": "RJ340SSOQN0WI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the Kindle to use to replace my phone as my primary news reader.  Below are my honest opinions, take them as you may.My first impression upon opening the box was marvelous.  The 7\" tablet is as small as I hoped it would be but the weight seemed to be on the heavy side.  Given the specs and performance I attribute the weight to the battery.  Good thinking on Amazon's part, there is a 1/2\" or so bezel all around the screen that can (will) be used for a grip.  The moment I turned it on I was pretty excited.  I am an android fanboy and knew what to expect but the Carousel launcher was shockingly underwhelming.  As you start loading media your kindle's launch screen will literally be polluted (60% of the screen is used) with the cover of every thing  (websites visited, album covers, magazines, books, etc.).  Your favorites are down below and you have to finger down to see them all.  This Kindle is mine but my wife and kids will be using it and for the sake of easier navigation I had to replace the Carousel.Once the interface was a bit more customizable as to minimize the family's learning curve we all were able to really enjoy using the Kindle.  I appreciate the thought that went into the media applications.The second absolutely essential app I downloaded was a file manager.  I know this is a Kindle review but most of these apps empower you to be able to access Windows shares, are available in the Amazon App Store and free.  After I loaded some media I found that I really really enjoy using the default MP3 application.  The interface is clean, easy to navigate quickly, the sound quality is outstanding and can run in the background (ie. browsing the web and listening to your collection).  There is no EQ and the sound volume is relatively low compared to my phone (not really a negative but noteworthy).I haven't bought a book or magazine so have no comment.  I have really intended my Kindle to be a tablet and to utilize apps.Pandora & XiiaLive are both able to play in the background.  YouTube open in the browser is not.  I have to keep the browser active on the YouTube tab otherwise playback ceases.  Multitasking has not been enabled on the Kindle.  Kind of strange right?  When you navigate away from the Silk browser, which is great by the way, it acts as if it was closed so whatever you were looking at, working on, submitting, etc. is gone.  This reason is why, for all the greatness of the Kindle, it is not a five star product.Video support is straight forwardly limited to MP4.  Kind of a bummer here but not a deal killer and not a reason, for me, to rate the Kindle lower than four stars.The Settings mini screen is easily accessed by pressing the gear in the top-right hand side of the screen.  WiFi has worked absolutely flawless.  Volume and Brightness are easily accessible here.  There is no hardware volume rocker and can only be controlled by software.Overall,ConsCarousel and no customizationNo multitasking (mainly negatively impacts the browser)Lack of video codec support (no multitasking so you still can't utilize the OS to select which program to use to open a video file)Amazon has the accessory market locked upProsYou can easily sideload appsYou can easily load a new launcher over CarouselYou can easily download your own media from a network shareThe included apps, especially AmazonMP3, are good (gallery seems quirky)Eventually the Kindle feels less like a Kindle and more like your Kindle.

It will force you to manage your movies if you are taking it on trips and stuff like that.Multi-Touch screen only supports 2 touches. This only matters if you are going to play action games (imagine going left [1] while running [2] and trying to tap a jump button [3]) that require 3 or more touches.There are way fewer apps for the KindleHaving said all that, the Kindle is 40% the price of the iPad. If you want to use it to read books around the house and occasionally surf the web for articles or to check the weather or something, this is awesome. It also resides in the Amazon ecosystem so purchasing books is super easy. If you'd like to also bring it along to watch a movie on a plane or something like that, it is good too, but you'd have to setup the movies you want to see before doing it because it won't hold nearly as many movies as the iPad.If you need cell access, want to get a lot of apps, play lots and lots of games that are more action type games rather than card games and such, or don't care about the price as much and don't mind buying books on amazon.com then reading them with the iPad reader app, then the iPad is probably for you.We have been very pleased with the Kindle. For most web use that is more complex where the Kindle doesn't do the trick, I'd rather just stand up and go to the kitchen to use a laptop and have a keyboard/mouse than slightly upgrade to an iPad and still struggle. My wife and I are going to also buy a traditional Kindle, so we'll both be able to read at the same time, and have the benefit of the super-long battery life and \"in the sun\" readability of the eInk for trips to the beach and all that.

I never dreamed to ever see such a thing. When I was a kid (pre WWII) my uncle and I built a crystal radio from a crystal we found in a mine dump. Boy's Life magazine had the instructions. He went off to war (he did come back) and that radio was my prize possession. We had no other news source during the War years in the Ozarks. I eventually became an electronic engineer due to that radio. Even so I never dreamed of such a thing as the Fire...What can I say that hasn't been said already.  The cloud is awesome. What a great concept! I used the cloud music uploader to upload my favorite music (Devotchka) to the cloud. Neat..I have a Kindle 3. All my books were available from the cloud for the Fire.. WOW, again.... The Fire is a gateway to a vast computer built by Amazon...So I guess I will retire the Kindle 3. The fire is much easier to read books with the back lit screen.. Netflix and Amazon prime movies are beyond counting... I love movies ever since I saw my first one in 1946..It was fun figuring out how the Fire operates. It is very intuitive. I always read the instructions after the fact, more fun that way.The Fire was delivered within 24 hours (how do they do that?).The Fire case is slick, hard, and heavy to hold. A cover is very necessary. Many on Amazon. I chose the Poetic TM (cheap 9.95). It works fine and makes the Fire much easier to hold.Oh one little item: when you connect to an outside network (like in a restruant) and you enter the password. You notice that the enter key on keyboard is missing. Just slide the password up and you will see a save button.The touch screen takes a little getting use to with my big fingers especially the keyboard. I do like the way the keyboard handles the caps and numbers. Otherwise the Fire is a BIG WINNER!Humm, I am rethinking the Kindle 3 I have. It is easier to read in bed than the Fire. The Fire is a bit heavy and hard to hold. With the cloud I can move books between the two. Plus, when I fall asleep and drop the Kindle, don't have to worry about damage as with the Fire.IF AMAZON DOESN'T HAVE IT, THEN I DON'T NEED IT.Wouldn't it be neat to order a car from Amazon (Hint, Hint).", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "I like it for what it is...", "Author": "pbw7970", "ReviewID": "R2C6FCYADHAOF8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had the kindle fire since February 2012. I bought it at a brick-and-mortar store because I went there to compare it to the ipad hands-on. Once I chose it, over spending the additional $$ for an ipad, I decided not to wait. I did buy the  additional \"Fair Trade\" warranty from Amazon.Anyway, I like it for what it is.I expected to access flash-player content on the Web. I can.I expected to be able to read books on work breaks or while waiting at appointments. I have. I was not craving lots of newspapers or magazines. I really enjoy having two or three books with me without carrying two or three paperbacks around. Borrowing books from my local library has been a big savings plus! My service-worker salary doesn't always leave $$ to buy several books at a time. I have only had one incident of missing pages from an Amazon book.I expected to play one or two of my favorite games. I do. I can play others on my iphone. Only once (just yesterday) have I had real problems downloading an app from the Android Market. I got an error message saying my device was not registered. The Amazon Customer Service representative chatted me through the solustion in just a minute or two. (Reboot. DUH!)I expected to listen to a little music sometimes while I read. I have. The music seems \"fuller\" with  earphones (my iphone earphones work), but the \"volume\" control in the main menu does not seem to effcet the volume of playback. I am not really tech savy so, I not have figured out how to or if I can adjust the playback volume. I still like it for what it is.I realize it is a device built around Amazon content and that's okay by me. I realize, too that the Android Market does not have as much content as itunes.I sometimes wish for a bigger memory for available apps but I think that would probably increase the price of the device. I think the Cloud allows for downloading content to the device and deleting content from it without losing it all together when memory space becomes limited. I wish it were a little lighter weight, but I believe that would be a price-driver, too. I just use my cover as a stand. I like it for what it is and I liked the price!In conclusion: if you like to read books; like music but are not addicted to itunes; are not a big-time gamer; and can live without a gazillion apps this is a device worth buying!I did eventually find the right \"view\" selection to adjust the volume of music playback.", "Date": "April 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Refurbished Kindle Fire", "Author": "CMC", "ReviewID": "R2C3586QHOWF84", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the refurbished Kindle Fire for $30 less because I wasn't sure how much I'd use it.

I did not buy the Fire right away because I was unsure if it would fit my lifestyle. I loved my Kindle e-readers because I wanted something I could read books with - and the Kindle e-readers excel amazingly at that. However, I gave in to my desire to try out a tablet and I am satisfied with the Kindle Fire.First and foremost, the Kindle Fire is not an iPad and shouldn't really be compared to it in most cases. The Fire is best compared to B&N;'s Nook Tablet. I did consider buying the Nook Tablet, however I am a loyal Amazon customer and already have a good deal of Amazon content and it made the best sense to buy the Fire over the Nook Tablet. Where the Fire should be compared to the iPad is what you expect from your tablet. I wanted something small with access to the internet and my Kindle books and something I could stream my netflix movies from. I don't need 3G since I am always around WiFi so for my lifestyle, the Kindle Fire is my best option. The price was perfect for what I expected to receive. Of course I could buy an iPad for $500+ and love how beautiful it is, but my reality is that the iPad is too big and too expensive to justify purchasing.The Fire is, in my opinion, sleek and beautifully designed - when I look at the Fire I see it is ready for me to use it. Some people have complained about the lack of buttons - like a volume button or a home screen button, but that is not a detraction for me. I have also read about the power button being placed where it is easy to accidentally turn off - this is not a problem for me because I use my Fire in landscape 99% of the time. However I would like to see the power button moved on later models since that seems to be the running consensus.The picture quality is beautiful, I constantly remind myself I am looking at something on a 7 inch screen and it looks better than my new laptop's screen. I have had a great experience with the touchscreen - it is responsive and not too sensitive where I annoy myself with constant mistakes. I have noticed that some people prefer to have a tablet with more storage than the 8 gigs (or 6 gigs user assessable) the Fire offers, however with the Amazon cloud I do not look at that number and shudder. All of my Amazon content will always be safely stored on the cloud so it is not an issue for me. I will say that I would like to see an sd card option, like the Nook Tablet. I think it would be easier to side load user content that is not from Amazon.The Silk browser was a little slow at first, but I couldn't tell if it was the Fire or my WiFi (I have notoriously wacky WiFi sometimes). Over a week after purchase, however, I feel the browser has caught up with me and understands what I am looking for and anticipates my browsing. I love that I can use tabbed browsing and go back and forth between screens often. The layout of the home screen is very functional and I have had no problems with the carousel or the \"book case\" of favorite apps.Speaking of apps, I know there is complaint that Amazon has yet to deliver substantial applications to run on the Fire, however for me - all I need are simple apps - a calculator, angry birds, some news apps and netflix. Hopefully, the app department grows as the Amazon Fire community grows. Apple did not have all their current apps right away - so the apps will grow as the user-base grows.My complaints are that the email app is not up to par with what I expect, so I just log onto my gmail account using the silk browser. Also, the photo app is abysmal - however I do not need to use it so I am not too disappointed. But Amazon should ensure that all programs that come pre-installed on the Fire are 1. easy to use 2. runs well and 3. do not suck.I love my Kindle Fire, it has everything I need in a tablet - internet browsing, email, my amazon content, and netflix. Before buying any tablet, be it the Fire the iPad or any of the other droid tablets, think about what you want to use it for. Do you really want to spend over $200 on something just to check facebook and email or watch videos?

If they would applied a modicum of effort and quit trying to make it into something it is not, they would have seen how great the Kindle Fire really is.This was in response to their 'complaints'.1) There is a brightness control in the system settings. With a little effort you would have found it. Its so bright you can use the Fire in broad daylight.2) Calendar? There's a calendar app. Only takes a second to find it.3) Amazon monopoly? Notta. There's a workaround. Do a google search for what you want, email it to yourself, upload to device from email. About two minutes worth of effort.4) Not enough storage? Did you even read the owners manual that was included? As a Kindle Fire owner, you have free and unlimited access to the cloud. No need to store anything. Plenty of room to store what you use on a regular basis.5. Only available to US residents? Again, didn't do your research did you. It is available to everyone. Example: UK residents can purchase these and any apps they might not have immediate access too can be uploaded via a workaround.6) The Fire is lightning fast as long as you don't bog it down with a bunch of unnecessary crap. Utilize the free cloud access. This also helps with the stuff you are hoarding on your laptop. Upload it via the Fire to the Cloud and delete it from your laptop. Come to think of it, this is probably the first time in a few weeks I've used my laptop...7)There is a keyboard with a micro usb for about $50, well worth it. Another reason I haven't used my laptop lately.Don't think of the Kindle Fire as a notepad or an IPad that is lacking, as it is not either or those nor is it trying to be.The Kindle Fire is an E-Reader with a whole lot of bells and whistles.

Mitchell", "ReviewID": "R10HMNUU689XRQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First a bit of background: I am a 26 year old college student. I am definitely \"tech savvy\" but not part of the popular crowd when it comes to choosing devices. I have always been reluctant with this whole touch based interface that phones and computers are using today. I have never owned a smartphone of any kind, nor have I ever owned a tablet. I have used a friends Droid and I have actually picked up an iPad before so I am not completely ignorant to these new popular devices. I own a LG cosmos and its just fine for me. I have a bitchin desktop at home for everything else.Since mid November I was addicted to watching movies and reading reviews about the fire. I was promised one for christmas and I was really excited to see how it would stand against all the hype and all the bad reviews. I never expected it to be just like an iPad. I expected the Fire to be a glorified e-reader that was capable of handling other types of media. I don't understand why everyone would want to compare it to an iPad because I always thought that an iPad was a complete waste of money. I mean, come on, if you really want to spend that kind of money for a device why not get a damn laptop? That just seems more functional and practical to me.After about two weeks with the Fire I can say that it has honestly surpassed my expectations. For the money this thing can do A LOT. For all the people complaining that it is not a productivity device: I would take a second look at the appstore. I am a mechanical drafting and machining student and this thing has apps like autodesk sketchbook and autocad ws that are perfect for storing and editing drawings. You can easily manage and view online documents with the default office app, and there's even \"cloud briefcase\" apps like evernote, sugarsync, and others. So, I have no idea what people are complaining about in that area. As a college student this works for me. And I have over 100 pdfs of manuals and textbooks at my fingertips all out of my own private collection!!!!As for the slow balky interface and web browser? I do not mind waiting literally 2 seconds for a page to load. The touch screen seems just as responsive as any other device I've used with the same interface (ipad, droid). Sometimes the screen can respond to my finger being really close and I accidently select something I didn't want to but I got used to that very quick. I have thick fingers and I have never had a problem. If you seriously want to complain about that then get yourself a stylus, son. And dolphin browser is available with golauncher described in the next paragraph.For those who do not like the standard background and UI, you can allow 3rd party apps and install golauncher. (right now my home screen resembles ice cream sandwich) And you can do that WITHOUT ROOTING!!!!!!! And with that you can create widgets and have up to 9 screens and 3 task bars. The golauncher apk file is free from their website and you can even download golauncher widgets too! I have a shortcut placed right above the home button which allows me to switch back to the old interface and access my books and documents and amazon video. So there's the answer to that complaint.For those who do not like that there is no external volume controls....: COME ON! is it really that hard to move your finger over a couple inches, tap the bar and slide the volume to the desired level? you are able to control the volume when watching video right on the screen as well. So to those who are whining about that: Stop you lazy bastards...As for the complaint about 1 click purchasing and the lack of parental controls? You parents do realize that you are PARENTS, right? Teach your kid about money and dont give a $200 dollar device to a kid who doesn't understand that it comes with some responsibility. And I believe that you can edit your 1-click purchase options on your amazon account preferences. Just turn it off or get your kid his own bank account connected to their fire. It's like when parents complain about their kids seeing something on TV that is inappropriate: watch your kid, dude. Don't blame others for your own bad parenting.For the complaint that it has no camera or mic? Do you really need that? Maybe those hipsters that like to skype at the local starbucks do, but I sure think its unnecessary. I have a camera on my phone, anyways. And the fact that there's no 3G network? \"Oh no! I can't constantly check my facebook status!\" Yeah that doesn't matter to me.And finally to address the complaint of the power button: I HAVE NEVER ACCIDENTLY TURNED THE FIRE OFF. You do know that to turn it off you need to hold down that button. Pressing it will simply put it into standby mode and pressing it again will bring it back to exactly what you were doing. So that is settled.Bottom Line: (Good, Bad, and yes Ugly)-Good: Great HD video, productive apps, beautiful screen, good size and weight, Games run awesome (namely plants vs zombies and worms), music and net radio apps work GREAT, great for reading books/pdfs/docs/txt, changable interface (for those that are smart enough), and the best part: its only $200!!!!-Bad: Doesn't have every app I wanted (spotify, google skymap and others), Battery life is kind of sucky (I charge it on average once a day), the backing seems like it gets marred and scratched easily so get yourself a case (marware lightweight is good), and lastly you cant do EVERYTHING on it like emulators and better games without rooting it and voiding the warranty. But just give amazon some time to build the appstore and everything will be there I am sure.-Ugly: I have one question for the designer of this tablet. If the best way to view videos on the fire is in landscape, then why did you choose to put both speakers at the top of the device? Seems really strange to me that they are not on one of the longer sides of the fire. Its better to watch videos with headphones because of this. And the speakers are not really that loud so they work better with computer speakers or plugged into a system of sorts.So that's my review...Seems like most of the complaints are inane or easily fixed so all-in-all this is a great buy!For those who think the iPad is better? You are probably right, but its like comparing a lexus to a lamborghini. They are both nice but one is more practical for everyday use. Do yourself a favor and save your money and get yourself a Kindle Fire.", "Date": "January 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "KINDLE FIRE - LISTEN 2 ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Author": "JesusIsLord", "ReviewID": "RNOBIJ6IYHNAU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "5 STARS FOLKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!First of all, I have read probably 50% of all the reviews posted for the Kindle Fire and said ok, now it's time for me to speak up. I hope you find this review to be helpful. Wanna hear it? here it go:I was given the Kindle Fire for Christmas and mind you, wasn't that hip to the hype surrounding it. Everyone was talking about how nice it is and how it's comparable to an Ipad but I hadn't did any personal research on it until now. Nevertheless, I was soooooooo excited when I got it because this is my first E-Reader/Tablet so I was anxious to dive right in.I opened it and immediately liked the face of it. Nice, slick and clear. It does not come with an instructional. Amazon provides both manual & video instructionals via their website (which are very helpful) and there's also a \"Kindle Fire User's Guide\" on the device. Also on the device, You can go to \"Quick Settings\" and then go to \"Customer Feedback and Support\" to get further help. NOW TO THE SPECIFICS:SETUP/REGISTRATION: My setup was not that easy because the very first thing it asks you to do is to choose a wifi network (Internet Connection) to connect to and I do not have wifi at my home. So I chose the option to setup later and proceeded to register my Kindle but I needed wifi to do that as well. I was however, able to bypass all of that to get to the main screen just to see what was what but again, was limited to what I could do without a wifi connection.WIFI: This is actually the only thing that I dislike about the product. 90% of the Kindle's functions center around wifi. As irritating as this is, I have a feeling that Amazon is preparing us for what is to come concerning technology. Everything will probably be Wifi centered. Moving on, this can get a bit frustrating at times because when I'm trying to play games, read a magazine, or some other things, I keep seeing a message come up saying \"No Internet Connection\". So I called Customer Service (a number I retrieved from Amazon's website) and they informed me that I need to either contact my Internet Service Provider (For me is Comcast)or simply go to Target or Best Buy and purchase a router for my home. In the meantime, going to a \"hotspot\" such as Star Bucks or McDonald's would be the only way to retrieve wifi. That is what I did and have been doing until I resolve this issue. I mainly go to Star Bucks, both stand alone and one's located in Barnes & Noble and it connects just fine.SCREEN GLARE: I have seen reviews about people complaining about a glare and I have not experienced that at all. I think the screen is perfect and whatever I am doing, I see it very clear and there is no glare.POWER BUTTON: People have complained about the location of the power button on the Kindle Fire and folks, don't believe the hype. I hit the button one time and it just shuts the \"screen\" down, not the whole device. Before it completely goes off, it will ask you \"are you sure you want to shut down\" so if you press the power button by mistake, it will not power off. Once I realized that, I became conscience of how I held it and it's been smooth sailing ever since. It also is rotatable, you turn it sideways and upside down to avoid hitting the power button by mistake.FUNCTIONS: So far I have downloaded some apps, games, and magazines and everything works just fine. I have no problems at all concerning it's functions. People have said that it freezes up and you have to tap it repeatedly before it moves. I have not had these problems. I'm able to nagivate very well on my Kindle Fire.MUSIC TRANSFER: I am a music lover so I was hoping and praying I could transfer my music from my home computer to my Kindle Fire via a USB cord and thank God I could. Now the Kindle Fire does not come with a USB cord but I happen to have a Sprint Evo and the USB/Charger I use for that is interusable with the Fire. So I was able to transfer my music to my Fire and it sounds awesome. Love it!CUSTOMER SERVICE: I have called Amazon's customer service to help me when I was trying to connect to wifi and download some apps and they were SUPER! Patient, kind, and very helpful. Thank you Amazon!KINDLE FIRE VS IPAD: Ok ya'll listen to me. TWO TOTALLY DIFFERENT DEVICES! I have seen and handled an Ipad and now the Kindle Fire. The Kindle Fire is designed to be an E-Reader with Tablet bonuses. If you go to various websites, you will see that it comes up under the E-Reader's section, not necessarily the Tablet section. Comparing The Fire to an Ipad I feel is not fair because people are being misled of people saying how the Fire is better but it depends on what you will use it for. It's like comparing a cell phone to a lap top. On most cell phones these days, you have the bonus of internet, camera, USB connections, apps, etc BUT it's primary use is to be used as a phone, not a lap top. Likewise with the Kindle Fire. You have the bonus of all these other additions, but it's primary use is as an E-Reader. The Ipad is something that does over and beyond right now because it is taking the place of desktop computers so it's functions are more durable and sustainable. The Kindle Fire is a wonderful device doing everything it should be doing AS AN E-READER.Overall, I really enjoy my Kindle Fire and can't imagine life without it. I hope this review has inspired you for the better. It's all about preference folks. I'm not going to sit here and tell you this beats an Ipad or any other tablet because everyone wants something for various reasons. I love to read, go on youtube, twitter, play games and listen to music. With The Kindle Fire, I feel my mission is accomplished.

I debated on purchasing this or a basic iPad 2, but could not seem to justify the more than double the price difference for the iPad. I am glad I chose the Kindle.The color screen is amazing, and it is small enough to slip in my purse and take everywhere. The only con I have (and this is not enough to care about, for me) is the weight of it. Though looking relatively small, I think it weighs more than it should - but again, this is not enough of a deterant to me to keep me from owning it and recommending it to others.Also, the amount of free things - from books to games, is incredible! I find myself looking for new books daily, as they change that rapidly. Things you get free one day, will cost the next, and vice versa. A very nice treat for those that love to shop for the fun of it! You can also get a featured daily app for free - many of which I have got (usually games), and a few I have passed on, but I always check. Plus, checking out a top book for free from Amazon (one per month) is a great added bonus! I also recommend getting a Prime membership because you have access to all kinds of tv shows and movies for free.I have tried various free games (ones that are free because of paid ads that come up every once-in-awhile), and a few I have been so addicted to that I purchased the paid version. Gem Miner, Angry Birds, etc. I have also tried several books that I loved and would have probably never found the author if not for the free starters, and subsequently purchased the 'paid' books by the authors.I did find that for myself, however, it is easier for me to navigate the Fire using a stylus with a soft rubber-type end on it (about the size of your fingertip). I have thought a few times about getting a screen protector because of all the finger & stylus marks that I notice when it is shut off on 'black screen', but a small screen-cleaning cloth I already had works perfectly and takes just a second to wipe it off to look like new. I did buy a soft silcone-type holder that was made for the Fire, and I never take it off.All in all, I think everything (except weight), price included, is a WIN-WIN for everyone!", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good value for money", "Author": "BG \"BG\"", "ReviewID": "RSHS5ZO33JKM8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I already have an Ipad 2 but my kids use that most of the times from books to games. My wife uses it for skype. So I get really little time to use it so I decided I wanted another tablet but not so expensive as an Ipad. Before I went in to the buying mentality I decided I am not getting an Ipad equivalent as I know You get what you pay for. Kindle fire received a lot of attention and decided to give it a try mainly because it was only $199.The screen looks excellent. There seems to be some quirks on the touch screen especially when you try to touch on the apps. But I wish amazon soon would release that update they ve promised that would fix all of those issues. I turned off one click buying option right when I registered so didnt have much of a security problem. It clocked out the next day and asked me to re login to buy anything from the amazon store.The speakers on these things are the highlight. Even Ipad doesnt have good speakers or music reproduction.Apps. I downloaded splashtop HD which runs flawlessly to control your mac or windows laptop/desktop. Netflix works flawlessly and so does facebook. ES file browser app not only shows and works with all your network shares but it can download anything from an FTP server as well. 49% of app developers said they are interested in developing apps for Kindle Fire before Nov 14. Imagine that percentage now after KF is now ranked only next to Ipad in the units sold.Havent had a problem with browsing. Most websites are pretty good especially those that have flash. There is a lot of complaint out there saying that the silk browser is not as quick as they claim. But it becomes faster ONLY after it learns your usage pattern.Other android tablets (Although KF is a heavily modified android). I considered Acer Iconia, Asus transformer and Toshiba thrive. All of them have microphone, camera, bluetooth and GPS. Camera and microphone becomes relevant for me only when using Skype or Gtalk. Both have horrible apps on android that negates the use of the camera on them. Skype on Ipad 2 on the other hand looks and feels awesome. So without VOIP not working so great on those tablets that have a camera and microphone, KF was the obvious choice for me. Also most importantly KF is $50-200 lower than those.Bottom line: For the price you pay you feel as if you've stiffed amazon royally (My brain knows its not true but my user experience says otherwise).", "Date": "December 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "A great tablet for the money", "Author": "richie hsiu", "ReviewID": "R28JOZSX5TFS2X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did some research on the Kindle Fire for a few months and even hesitated to purchase it on the initial introduction back in Novermber.

The touch screen is responding fast and GUI interface is simple to use and I am really impressed with the qulity of this small tablet.

I have bought every generation since, including most recently the Touch (more of that later).  I didn't get the Fire initially because I wasn't sure about the backlit screen.  Then there were so many negative reviews  especially ones from long time Kindle users and (like me) fans, that I decided - sight unseen - against ordering a Fire. It took me until the week before Christmas to take a look at the  the Fire and try it out as a potential gift for someone.  The feel of it in hand, the really nice resolution screen and the price decided me to buy it as a gift. I did try it out when I got it home as I didn't want to give it as a gift if so many of the negative reviews were right.  After 24 hours I am keeping this one and getting another for my friend.  I am NOT letting this one go... I fell in love with the thing!As stated, I read all of the negative reviews and (on short acquaintance with the Fire) here are some initial \"debunks\".  Its a long review, but I am making an attempt at addressing the most frequently heard complaints that initially influenced me against the Fire.Firstly, it is not an iPad and if you expect it to be you will be disappointed. I do have an ipad and will most likely still use it for surfiing, movies etc.I am a light sleeper and do a lot of reading (on and off) throught the night.  I travel a lot and this means taking a booklight as well as all the other detritus business travel demands. Anyone who has ever relied on a booklight knows that even the best of them (I have a great little Brookstone rechargeable number) dim pretty fast if you read for any length of time.  There is nothing more annoying than struggling to read by a quickly dimming booklight! I have an iPad 2 and discarded the Kindle app on it because I found the backlit screen too tiring on the eyes, even though it fulfilled my desire to be able to read after dark without a booklight.  As the backlit screen was the thing I wanted - and didn't want - with the Fire, lets start with the backlit screen.Backlit screen. It is the thing I am most struggling to get used to.  The 3 color options help. I saw in some negative reviews the complaint that it was too bright and \"lit up the room\".  So did both my little booklight and the iPad. My husband (lucky soul!) is a very heavy sleeper but nevertheless I still think he deserves a dark room to sleep in! The white is VERY bright and I would agree that in a dark room it does light up the room.  The sepia is less bright, but for some reason is a little annnoying after a while and still very  bright.  I found the white on black to be very comfortable to read in the dark and it definitely doesn't light up the room. I did find that changing the typeface (serif seems easier on the eye with the white on black), the size and the line spacing made the black on white a pretty comfortable read in a darkened room.  I am thinking I may end up using that setting all the time, but there is a reflective tendency on the black background that I found made reading in a lighted room with this color combo less then satisfactory. So far I am switching to the black on white for daytime or \"lighted room\" reading. I do find it MUCH easier in daylight than the iPad, which frankly is unusable in bright daylight for any purpose whatsoever (IMO). The settings on the Fire are so easy to change, this may sound like a hassle but really isn't.  All that said, I have dimmed the brightness setting all the way down for reading and (although this may be a \"nit\") the last 3rd of the brightness slider doesn't dim it any further.  I would like it to dim a little more but as I said, its probably a niggle and is entirely liveable with.  A final comment on this, when you read book descriptions and reviews on the Fire, the grey background is almost like the eInk display... so why not a black or dark grey on grey option in the settings?\"Stutter\" when browsing.  Yes, I did notice this.  It was a little annoying.  Slow down the scrolling a little and it goes away.  I find that fast scrolling on the iPad gives you that \"checkerboard\" screen which is just as annoying so I discounted this as an issue (at least for me).Non-responsiveness of screen.  I have done a lot on it so far and haven't noticed this.  One thing I didn't like with the Touch was that it was TOO responsive, sometimes jumping pages ahead with one accidental too-heavy touch.  In fact, altogether I found navigating the Touch clunky and I never felt I was really in control of it.  It was either zooming off somewhere I didn't want to go or seeming too difficult to get somewhere that was easy on the previous Kindle keyboard models.Security.  A prevalent security related complaint was that (if ordered from Amazon) the Fire ships registered to your account so if it goes astray during shipping anyone has full access to your Amazon account. This is the case with all Kindles and has been from the beginning, but with access to more than just reading material I get why this is an issue. Another complaint was that if lost or stolen, your account is accessible through the device BUT (1) you can in fact password it (Menu -> tools (gear icon) -> security) and (2) you can order it disconnected from you account by marking it as a gift.  Another common security related complaint was its unsuitability for kids (the price making it otherwise attractive), again because it is attached to your account and therefore credit card.  Some found Amazon's suggestion to set up a separate (small credit limit) account for the kid's Fire unacceptable, but I really can't see why that is such non-starter.  Others complained about the carousel showing the last thing you accessed as being potentially embarrassing and (again) potentially unsuitable for kids.  Like anything else...  if you are looking at material you want to keep to yourself, keep the device to yourself too... just as you would a book, magazine or video that you don't want the world (or your kids) to know you have. Another point on the \"most recent\" in the carousel is that at least YOU can see what the kids were looking at on the device. Frankly the whole kid thing seems more like a parenting issue than a device issue, but maybe thats just me.Position of the power button.  Yes its on the bottom...  another standard with later Kindles.  It is an awkward spot and since it is a \"press\" and not a \"slide\" (as with previous Kindles including the latest models) I get this could be an issue.  The easiest solution is to just turn the darn thing upside down. The screen reorients and now the power button is at the top.  (OK I know the power jack is still right next to it, but really...  you are plugging in WHILE doing something so critical that a power-off in error is an issue?)Reading magazines.  I agree with other reviewers.  They look good but if you want to read the text you can't do that without zooming or going to text mode.  Neither enhance the \"magazine\" look and feel and I would say this is the biggest negative I have so far.  All the pictures of the Fire show magazines using the entire screen, so not sure if this is intentionally misleading or there is a setting somewhere.  If there is I couldn't find it.Video.  I think it is  a little small for watching movies etc.  It would probably be fine on a plane if you want to only bring one device while travelling. The resolution is great though and speed of streaming seemed just fine, I experienced no lag (as reported by other reviewers). In fact I experience more lag with Netflix or Youtube on my iPad.Email, Games, Browsing.  To be fair I intend to keep using my iPad for these things so can't really comment.  Tried them and they seem fine but I likely won't be using the Fire for these things very often if at all.Books.  I REALLY LIKE the \"bookshelf\" look and feel.  My \"style\" with the Kindle is to keep samples on the device, browse the samples to see what mood I am in for my next book and buy if I like the sample. I currently have about 150 samples on my Touch and now my new Fire. Being able to browse the covers and the easy access to the book description and reviews makes this a much more streamlined experience. This improved experience was the first (and so far the main) thing that sold me on the Fire.  Looking up book descriptions and reviews was always a clunky experience on the eInk versions, marginally better on the Touch (at least you can scroll the reviews) but the Fire's experience in this area is MUCH better.  I used to categorize my samples and that was a nice feature which some have complained is lacking on the Fire.  I initially thought so too, but the ease of scrolling through a \"bookshelf\" with color book covers and easy access to book description makes it a non-issue now I am used to it.Weight, heat etc.  It is a great size.  I have small hands and can still hold it one-handed.  It is a LITTLE heavy, especially compared to the eInk versions.  In my opinion the Touch (which initially I thought was VERY sleek & slim) is actually a little too small and light.  So far, for downloading and reading books, and I did not find the Fire got hot or even warm for those functions. It is VERY fast downloading books and movies.  It downloaded a movie much faster than my Ipad.Overall I really like this device.  It won't replace your ipad or android tablet, but as a Kindle user and someone who will use the device mainly for reading and browsing Amazon content, I would recommend the Fire.  Overall (and by an increasingly large margin as I use it more) I MUCH prefer it to the Touch.  5 stars because it may not be perfect (what is?) but I fell for it anyway and believe if you set your expectations appropriately you won't be disappointed.", "Date": "December 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Just an ordinary 72 year old", "Author": "Tinker Belle", "ReviewID": "R3U1MHSAG0TAZV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am definitely not a technical person but I do enjoy reading.

No. does it cost less than half of the Wi-Fi iPad? Yes. Does it do 90% of what the average user does with their iPad? Yes.Pros- Smaller than iPad. Obviously a user preference but since I already have an iPad, nice to have something that's a bit smaller and easier to carry with me.- Well built - I was surprised at the build on this device as I was expecting something more...plastic, like the previous Kindles. It has a nice weight to it and feels very solid- Screen - very nice, good resolution- Touch-screen - I have not experience some of the negatives others have reported. I find the touch screen to be very responsive and works well. I also do like the lay-out of the screens...no offence to my iPad, but actually kind of a boring interface compared to the Kindle. User preference again.- Amazon prime - streaming of free content is great. Rent/buy movies & TV (download or stream)- Book reader - no big difference overall to Kindle app on other devices or iBooks for a reading experience. Maybe just a user prerence on devide size when you're, say, reading in bed.- Droid based app store. Al the major apps are here. Have my netflix, hulu, etc. alrfeady loaded. While not as many apps as iTunes, that's more a Droid issue but all the major ones are hereCons- No 3G. But remember, this is a $200 device as compared to $500-600 wi-fi iPad. I would guess that eventually they will release a 3G / 4G version, but keep in mind you would also need a data plan.- A little less \"work\" friendly perhaps. I use my iPad at work with various apps from Word to GoToMeetings. Again, this is not as much as power-packed device as the iPad. But again, not meant to be.So, to conclude...I love my iPad...and really like this one as well.

I have Amazon Prime and an Audible subscription, plus a mail subscription to Netflix.  I do NOT own a smart phone.  I read a lot, especially newspapers and books.  I tend to research something pretty thoroughly before making a purchase.Now my take on the Kindle Fire:This device is perfect for me.  As a Prime Member I can access a lot of shows and movies that I like, such as BBC TV shows.  The Fire also gives me access to tons of news sites whenever I'm at the coffee shop, library, or community center. It lets me read my email; I've even worked on a couple documents I had up on Google, albeit rather slowly. I've never had a problem connecting to the WiFi hotspots at various locations around town.  I'm able to read a book in the car at night while traveling with my spouse.  I use the Kindle 2 or 3 during daylight & sync it to the Fire or just note my position and pick up from there on the Fire.I love that the screen is bright and, usually, I can adjust the reading content to a size that works for me.I'm not so psyched about the carousel.  I can take it or leave it.The responsiveness of the touchscreen sometimes seems too sensitive; other times not sensitive enough.  You have to use a very light touch most of the time but sometimes you have touch the screen several times to get a response.I've been happy with the Android apps I've gotten from Amazon.  They work well and I don't worry about malware.  I tried one third-party app suggested by other Fire owners but had to reboot the device as it seemed to mess up the WiFi connection.  I wish Amazon had a larger selection of utility apps but I'm sure that will come.  I'm particularly happy with the ReadItLater app--it's very useful for gathering content to read offline when you can't connect to WiFi.  The app store seems very heavy on games.The Fire is perfect for me as I don't own a smart phone and was not expecting it to be a smaller version of the IPad.  I understood what I was getting for the price and am very happy.  I think consumers who know themselves pretty well will be satisfied if they decide to purchase the Fire.  Based on reading some of the postings at the Kindle forum, though, some buyers didn't do much homework before purchasing.Consumer, know thyself!(I normally try to be more organized and focused in my reviews but I think the other reviews have already covered most of the technical aspects.  This is just my off-the-cuff reaction to the Fire after almost a month of use.)Update 12-29-11:I have to say I'm using my Fire much, much more that I thought I would when I bought it.  As an Audible member, I love that I can easily find and listen to my NYT subscription without booting up my laptop.  I use the Sleepy Time Lite app every night to drift into dreamland.  I watch Prime videos (usually BBC TV episodes) or listen to an audiobook at lunch or while getting ready for bed.  I use the news apps to keep up with news all over the US & world, especially the cities where I have relatives.  I also keep a few albums in the MP3 player & play them while working in the kitchen or at the library.  I'm astounded at how much I've come to rely on my Fire in such a short time.I also should point out the a New York Times article today mentioned that apps from Amazon & Apple are thoroughly tested for malware, which isn't true at other app stores.

The books and mags are automatically stored in the cloud and on your device so you can take with you to read anywhere(no WIFI needed)!  They take up little to no space on the device and are beautiful in color.  With limited space on the device, however, I can only load so many movies and music.

This works in the home using your PC as a server.  I think Drop box works anywhere you go(its server storage is expensive however at $100 per year; first 2GB are free). The free 2GB anywhere server streaming is an acceptable stop-gap for me.  It was bogus of Amazon to suggest you could store and stream music, movies and pics directly from the Amazon Cloud. You can't stream movies or pics! Bad advertising cost you 1 point rating Amazon. You should fix this or allow for more storage on the device.

Hersl", "ReviewID": "R2BRYP8T2LDHRY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I must admit that I was pretty frustrated the first day that I began using this product.  I even went as far as calling customer service and getting a return label, but I decided to give it a chance and it has begun to grow on me.  I think most of the frustration with the touch screen and navigation comes from people not taking a few days to get used to the way the touch screen responds and learning the various menus.  Yes, the touch screen isn't as responsive as an ipad--this product is less than half the price, so I can deal with that.  The browser honestly works best with mobile sites as it is pretty easy to fat finger a lot of the links and buttons on normal sites without zooming way in.  Videos look great and load fairly quickly.  Books look good and were easy to read for a few hours--not as easy as e-ink, but I like how you can use the fire to read in the dark.  Swiping to turn pages may take a minute to get used to but wasn't that big of an issue for me.  The magazines that I bought (Runner's World, Maxim, and Consumer Reports) all looked good and were easy to navigate and read once you used the text mode for articles.  Some of the print in the regular page display for magazines was hard to pick up because of the 7 inch screen but it is easy to zoom in on the pages.  The speakers are adequate--they work well enough that a few people can watch a movie on it with the speakers turned all the way up and hear everything.  One of the major advantages that I see in this product is that it feels very sturdy--the screen seems like it will hold up to scratches well and it has handled minor drops and bumps without any damage so far.  This is important to me because I travel a lot and spend a lot of time living in semi-outdoor/remote areas for work and the fire is perfect  to load a few TV episodes or a movie and some books to take along with me and not have to worry about babying the device so much.  I would really have liked more storage or an SD card slot, but the device is only advertised as having 8 GB of storage so you know what you're getting when you buy it.  The kindle fire does everything I would expect it to do for $199.  I am happy with my purchase, and would recommend this to someone who is looking for an inexpensive product that they can use to consume media, do light browsing, and use all the usual apps like angry birds and words with friends.  If you need all the features that an ipad or a xoom has, then buy one of those products, otherwise you will be happy with the kindle.

The display is beautiful, it's intuitive to use and navigate, all my books from my other Kindle popped right up, and I generally spend a rather absurd amount of time on it every day!  I really like that it has a lock function to lock the orientation of the screen - that's really useful when I'm lying down reading and holding it at some goofy angle....which I do often.  Also, in general I've had excellent experiences with Amazon's customer service, so I feel really good about buying another product from them.That said, there are a few things that I wish were different about it. First, it doesn't have text to speech like the other Kindle models.  Honestly, I never used that function all that often on my other Kindle, but I was really glad I had it when I did use it.  Since I have an older model as well as the Fire, it really isn't a big deal to me personally cause I can just sync up to where I left off in my book and use the other kindle for text to speech if I really want to.  Second, the power button is located at the bottom of the tablet.  Most of the time it really doesn't matter cause the orientation of the screen shifts to however you're holding it.  But there are a few apps that don't rotate so I find myself accidentally hitting the power button sometimes when I don't mean to.  Also, the power cord should really be longer.  I've connected mine to a little 6 ft extension cord so I can use it plugged in without feeling like I'm the neighborhood dog stuck on the short leash.  The only other complaint that I have is that I haven't found a way to organize my books into folders like I could do on my older Kindle.  Being a really anal type A person, I miss my nice neat folders!  :-)None of the concerns listed above are annoying enough for me to give the Kindle Fire less than a 5 star rating.  If there was an option for 4.5 stars I might have picked that one, but since there wasn't, it's a 5 in my book!I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading.  If you're just looking for a cool gadget to play with, there might be a better fit for you - something with a camera like an itouch or ipad (although you'll spend a lot more!) But I don't care a flip about the lack of a camera, so the Kindle Fire is a perfect fit for me and I'll sing its praises gladly!", "Date": "December 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "It's perfect for me", "Author": "L. Helton", "ReviewID": "R2O8K9K4TTGFAC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had the Fire for about 2 weeks without any problems. I ordered it from Amazon and it came before it was estimated to come. It does say Kindle fire on the package, but mine said it on either side and the font wasn't that big, but it does say it, and I wish it didn't.My Fire came pre-registered, so all of my books and info were already loaded. All of my books transferred over. I know some reviews said that some of their books wouldn't transfer, but I had no problem with that. I didn't have to do an update on it, which I know some reviewers said they had to.I have an M-edge case from my previous Kindle keyboard and it fits my Fire perfectly, so I'm keeping it and saving some money. Because there is a little bit of case that comes off the bottom of the Fire, the power button isn't easily pushed. In fact, I haven't accidentally turned it off once due to it being in the case.I agree with the other reviews that I do not really care for the carousel. I tested my internet speed by googling the word \"dog\" and the google page came up on the carousel. That was not something I would need to reference back to at a later time. But when I got back on my Fire later, that icon was gone. I didn't delete it, since apparently there is no way to, so for some reason it fell off, which I was thankful for. Even though the carousel has some issues that need to be resolved, I usually don't refer to it. I click on the tabs at the top to access my material (books, apps, web, etc.).I have not had a problem with using the internet in regards to speed. I've used my Fire to browse the internet in my apartment and in two other homes with a wi-fi connection. I'm not sure how it will respond on a network with several users, but with the small networks I have used, I've had absolutely no problems.I've also had no problems with the touch screen. Some people said it wouldn't respond, but mine has never done that.Another complaint has been that there is no external volume control. You have to control the volume on the touch screen in the top right hand corner. It would be nice to have external volume, but you can access the volume control at all times on the touch screen. So this also hasn't been a problem for me.I love my kindle and it is a great value for the price. I live on one income and didn't want to pay the price for an iPad, so this was a perfect device for me. They do need to add more apps, but for a website that doesn't have an app (CNN, Google), I'm able to simply go to the website and access all the info I need. I've also never had a problem with zooming on a website or going from Portrait to Landscape mode. I know others have had problems, but I haven't; but I've gone to highly popular websites on it (Pinterest, Google, CNN, etc.)", "Date": "December 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not a computer, not a ipad, But the best of both worlds to me.", "Author": "Mark Goodwin \"Mark E.

The web integration is flawless. You can make bookmarks and sites you visit show up in opening screen at boot. Boot time is about 8 to 10 seconds including using the password. According to amazon you can add Your own music and video to it but keep in mind you are dealing with 8 gigs. When playing video from say CBS, the video is small as my iPod touch. If you blow up the video it becomes distorted. If you use the netflix app it is stunning. Full screen, no problem loading, very nice. I am a prime member so I have access to lots of video. Good site navigation, what a surprise, amazon is the home page.  I look forward to getting the stylus and the case without the case this item will not leave my home. All my books are here and it takes 3 to 4 seconds to download one. There is no point to download all.

I've had the Kindle Fire for a few weeks now. Let me tell you about my experience. The elements that work are incredible. By comparison, what doesn't work well, is beyond annoying.First, the KindleFire is not an iPad. It was not intended to be. What the Fire does incredibly well is provide reading material and viewing material in an intuitive, easy to access, portable format. I waited to buy an ereader until there was a color screen associated with Amazon's breadth of library. I wanted to be able to see color illustrations and photographs as I read. The Fire provides this extremely well.Newspapers vary by provider. The electronic version of the NY Times has all the words, but is very dry. I miss the breadth of photos and all the colorful ads. The mobile version of the NY Times is actually a much richer experience. In contrast, the Salt Lake Trib offers many photos, but still no fun ads. Magazine format also seems to vary by provider. Some are awkward and do not expand sufficiently. While these are not Fire issues per se, they diminsh the KindleFire experience.Listening to music while reading is a relaxing experience. Bluetooth access for external speakers would have been nice.Viewing Videos is lovely. There seems to be some video memory issue that cause the screen to lockup when you do extended browsing on an app like Netflix. Again, Bluetooth would have been nice for ease of access to external speakers when viewing a movie. A PRIME subscription provides a grand viewing library for no additional cost.Email, including Exchange interface with an app, is easy to quickly access. Email presentation is colorful and sending email is equally easy.Now for annoying.I almost wish there wasn't a browser. The browser is clumsy and awkward. WEB page content frequently misaligns. Links are unresponsive. Completing an on-line form, or purchase, is irritating enough to cause me to shut down the Fire and use my desktop computer. It's the browser component that causes my 4/5 rating. Without the archaic browser interface (if you are old enough, think of Prodigy or AOL on its worst day), my rating would have been 5+", "Date": "December 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "The fire is the bomb", "Author": "Nancy \"nance12020\"", "ReviewID": "RXDY3W1ZRLBLT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own an IPad and  a iPod  but when the fire came out I wanted one, because of its size and the prime benefits.

The Fire is easy to hold and has magnificent color, I love my IPad but I watch Buffy the vampire Slayer on the fire with headphones on and get absorbed in the video. It never snags or messes up during a movie and the seven inch screen is great for viewing and easy to hold. I use my Kindle fire alot I use my IPad but it is heavy to hold for to long so I use each of them for different things. The larger screen on the iPad is great for some things and the seven inch great for others. If you can not bring yourself to spend  five six hundred on a tablet the Kindle Fire will  do many of the things you wanted the iPad for. I am glad I have both and do not like to compare them because they are two totally different items but for the dollar you can not beat the  Fire and I have used and trusted amazon for years and years I  trust amazon and love the benefits Prime offers, the shipping and handling is great in itself but than add on Buffy's  entire collection for free viewing and I am sold.

Cleary", "ReviewID": "R2W23R1HSX834N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let me start this by saying the people comparing this to an iPad are either here for the sole purpose of talking up their iPad, or are just misunderstanding the intended audience of the Kindle Fire.Ignoring the price point would be silly, as the price point should give some indication as to what to expect from the Fire. It is NOT a full blown tablet, nor do I believe it was intended to be. This is clearly a e-reader/tablet hybrid designed to mix a little bit of both worlds for a funcational tablet to serve the masses.People are also complaining about things that with a little bit of reading they would have realized a lot sooner. The product clearly states it is wi-fi only. So that fact you are putting 'OMG NO 3G' as a con and acting surprised either leads me to believe you are here to just talk down on the Kindle, or you lack the intelligence to actually read product specifications before making a purchase.With that rant out of there, here are my thoughts on the Kindle Fire:Pros:Display is clear and crisp. I thoroughly enjoy watching videos on this device. It's just the right size to make it practical when traveling and moving about without being awkward.The build design and quality of the build is great. A lot of people have complained about the button being on the bottom and accidentally hitting it. This has not been a problem for me, as I am aware the button is on the bottom and thus I do not hit it, even accidentally.The OS is responsive and fast. Sure there are some occasional hiccups, but this stuff will get ironed out as more updates are released. It's current state is fully operable for me and I have not had any problems with the functions of the OS.Because the screen is so crips and clear, it makes reading on it quite pleasant. Sure, reading on bright white background with black text could certainly irritate your eyes after a while. Fortunately you can adjust the background and text color. I personally like the black w/ white text. I have read for an extended period without eye strain. The beige is also nice and quite comforting. It looks like you are reading paper, albeit illuminated paper.Cons:This isn't a problem for me, because I quickly found instructions online to enable sideloading of apps, and if you are saavy enough you can root the Kindle Fire and get native Google apps functionin on the Kindle (Gmail, etc.) But it would be nice if the Kindle Fire supported more apps or worked with Google on getting support in for their native apps on this device. Not everyone is fluent with technology and may not be comfortable with sideloading apps and certainly not rooting their device.External volume rocker or buttons would be nice.HDMI port would be nice.All things considered (price, target audience, etc) I don't really have any other issues with the Fire, and adding in things like a HDMI port or GPS would increase build costs which would then force Amazon to raise the price. Would I pay $50 more if it had the above features? Probably. But some wouldn't. Amazon is just about losing money on the Fire as is (banking on Fire users investing in Amazon Prime, etc. to make up the dollars).", "Date": "November 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Bang-for-your-buck!", "Author": "KreeH", "ReviewID": "RWTW3WAX4MM1D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the Kindle Fire for my wife as a gift, but I have ended up playing with it over the past few days.

The seven inch tablet size seems perfect for me. It offers a much larger viewing area over my Samsung Charge cell phone, yet it can fit in a large vest pocket. The high resolution screen is bright and it's much larger viewing area  allows native viewing of non-mobile webpages without excessive zooming. The screen keyboard is a perfect size allowing error free thumb typing and the response time for selecting applications, web browsing(the new silk browser is very fast!), reading is very snappy. Build quality seems good. It has a solid feel in your hands. The backside is some kind of rubbery plastic, non-slip material. I bought a protective case, but it hasn't been delivered yet.A side benefit is I can easily share Amazon apps between the Fire and our Android cell phones.Feature wise, I don't mind it not having a camera, GPS, or sd slot, but it would of been nice if Amazon had included a blue tooth capability.

After thoroughly reading the product description and becoming as familiar with the fire as possible so I can be aware of the things it was capable of doing, I decided it would be a good fit for me.This is my first tablet so I'm unfamiliar with them in general and I also don't have the web on my phone and don't have apps available so I'm pretty new to the tablet/app world. I've had my kindle for a few days and I have played with every feature it has to offer. If you are thinking about buying one, and are one of those delusional people who think this is going to replace an ipad or other devices, get your head out of your butt and fully read the product description.That being said, I really love my kindle fire. I was able to easily connect to my wifi, the update went off without a hitch and I was pleasantly surprised at the display. It is very lovely! Rich in color and detail. It had all of my books already loaded onto it, and just like everyone has said so far, everything that you've read, games you play etc is front and center for everyone to see. This isn't a huge problem, unless you have some... interesting items in your library. There are also subcategories at the top you can click on that will bring up only books, only apps, only music, etc. I found the touch to be sensitive enough that you don't have to press too hard on the screen, but not too sensitive. The web browser loaded pretty quickly, Netflix videos and hulu tv shows weren't interrupted by loading pages, and when scrolling down the page I didn't find it \"catching\" or anything like that. As long as the page is fully loaded scrolling has been pretty smooth. I didn't find typing on the keypad to be too difficult, but I do have slender fingers. Men might have a problem with this, but it just takes some time to get used to. I have found the storage to be sufficient, and I really like using the cloud. With the help of Amazon uploader, I was able to upload my entire itunes library to my cloud and I've downloaded a select few albums to my actual device. Playing games like angry birds, fruit ninja and others are pleasant. The graphics are great, the color is vibrant and there aren't any issues with it lagging.Things I don't like about the fire: the charging cord is short, just about the length as my cell phone's charging cord. If you are the kind of person who gets a headache from too much computer time, this device will bring on a headache.  Although you can turn the brightness of the screen down, it's not the same as e-ink but I've found that holding it at a particluar angle cuts down on the eye strain. The only other negative thing for me, is the fact that viewing magazines on the kindle is frustrating. It's difficult to read and magazines have so many size notes that it's frustrating to take the time to read them with the kindle.

The navigation buttons will fail to register the first time until the device figures out what you are doing.  And the device will produce some lag when when scrolling through menus slowly.  That being said, these are minor annoyances and the overall device still looks and feels like a premium device regardless.  I just hope the final polish on the OS experience is fixed with an OS or firmware update down the road.-The silk web browser is not what it is advertised to be.  Amazon promised very fast browsing through the silk web browser and that was an aspect of the device that I very much looked forward to, but I found it very disappointing.  I've played around with iPhones and iPads and I imagine many people have laid their hands on a demo tablet at some point and used the web browser of those devices.  The Kindle Fire experience just doesn't add up to what the Apple counterparts are capable of doing in terms of web browsing.  And I'll be the first to say that I'm really not impressed with Apple's browsing experience on the iPad and iPhone either.  I think the bottom line is that if a web site isn't designed to run on your device and it's heavy flash and interactive web site, it will fail to produce a good experience on any device except a powerful laptop or computer.  Overall, everyone in the device market fails at producing a good browsing experience on a tablet - unfortunately, Amazon fails a bit more with a browser that constantly lags, takes forever to load, and does not have the power to zoom quickly in and out of web pages and navigate through heavy flash interactive sites.  Hopefully, the Amazon Web Services team can dream up and develop some great technology to blast through web sites with ease, but until then, I'm not holding my breath on what is advertised by Amazon in this area.-The Kindle Fire is a little too heavy for my taste.  You'd never expect it by looking at the small device, but holy cats is this thing heavy.  And that's really just the issue in general: if you have used an e-ink kindle, you want this kindle to be equally as light as other Kindles and there's just this huge difference of expectation when you first hold the device.  When you are engrossed in content, in becomes less of an issue.  After hours of use, however, I find myself wanting to take a break from holding it and I wish it wasn't an impediment to longer sessions with the device.-The backlit screen isn't ideal for reading.  I still use my e-ink kindle for heavy reading and still think it's easier on the eyes and a more solid reading experience.  But with the Kindle Fire, I can listen to music and read at the same time if I'm reading more casual material and I like having that feature.-No HDMI output so that I can watch all of my Amazon video content on my tv.Negatives out of the way, let's move on the good stuff:-The Kindle Fire screen and OS design is beautiful.  The screen never scratches and is super easy to clean up finger marks with a soft cloth. Content like movies, apps, comic books, magazines, etc. look gorgeous on this device.  And the OS is amazingly simple and intuitive to use.  The only drawback is the volume control and battery life gauge become annoying pain points because these controls are always nested in another menu in the device.  In terms of the OS, Amazon should make it easier for users to get access to these two control points.  As a user, I am always adjusting the volume and I like to check how much battery life is left so I can decide whether I need to recharge the device or not.  The little battery icon in the upper right hand corner is just not descriptive enough to let me know when I'm really running low.-Integration with Amazon digital products is incredible.  This is by and large the most impressive feat of this device: the ability to bring all of my Amazon digital content in one place for consumption.  When you get your Kindle Fire, all of the content you've bought from Amazon (music, apps, videos, books, etc.) is stored to the Amazon cloud for easy access and consumption.  You can download any of your purchases from Amazon's cloud to your device at any time and the process is as simple as clicking an icon.  The biggest area of improvement for Amazon here is the ability to store videos from your Prime Amazon Instant Video collection.  The drawback here is that if you want to download any movies or tv shows to your device so that you can watch them on the go, you have to buy the products from the Amazon Instant Video store, which is difficult value proposition from Amazon when I can just get all that content from Hulu or Netflix.  If Amazon wants to remain competitive, they need to offer downloads to all of their instant streaming content and add more of the selection to that Prime service.  I'd be willing to pay more on my Prime subscription if Amazon had all the content that Hulu and Netflix had and I could download it to my Kindle Fire.  The second that happens, it's goodbye Hulu and goodbye Netflix.Other than the video store, the media base of the device runs beautifully. I can read books while listening to my favorite music. Apps execute and look amazing on the device.  Magazines, comic books, and children's books are great, and I expect the functionality in this area to grow and evolve so much more with the launch of this device.I could understand why reviewers might not capitalize Amazon digital integration on this device if they are not Amazon customers and if they don't want to be tied down to one device for their purchases of digital content, but let's not kid ourselves: this device is designed for Amazon customers to consume Amazon retail products from Amazon built stores.  If you love Amazon, you will love this device.  If you are heavily invested in another product from other competitors, you might be disappointed with the device because you probably have never thought of Amazon as a place to shop for digital goods.  This device will change that, but it is also an impossible sell for fanboys of other devices and companies.  I am biased to be an Amazon customer because their digital ecosystem is way more affordable than Apple.  If you're not tied down to a budget with a family, and you can afford Apple products, then you are wasting your time reading this review because you already know this device doesn't fit your needs.  Even if it did, you're probably spending time measuring the nanoseconds it takes to load and run Ninja Fruit on the iPad vs Kindle Fire to try and justify the investment you've made with Apple.  Whatever floats your boat.  I happen to have a lot of Amazon digital content and the Kindle Fire brings it all together into one device and makes it amazingly convenient to consume.  That's my primary use for the Kindle Fire and I love it for that reason alone.-The storefront for each media store is a wonderful experience.  Everything that you'd expect out of the Amazon shopping experience is built into this device and whether you are shopping for apps, books, or videos, the process of finding great content is amazingly simple and easy.  Even the payments and checkout process for buying goods gets out of the way of the device experience so that you can avoid annoyingly long click sessions to ultimately buy what you want with one click (the Kindle Fire is enabled by default with 1-Click purchase settings, but if you don't like that, you can change it).-Applications designed for the Kindle Fire or Android run flawlessly.  This is an area where I hope to see more development, and it's only a matter of time before a drove of developers cash in their Android SDK skills and put them to good use on the Kindle Fire.  The Kindle Fire brings the micro-application market to the mainstream with the Kindle Fire's price point, and when something is designed for Android or the Kindle Fire it works very well.  The Amazon application really is the first case in point, which virtually brings the entire Amazon storefront (digital and physical goods) to the Kindle Fire in a browse experience that works really well for tablets, and in my opinion easily beats the browse experience that I would get by trying to shop Amazon website through any tablet based browser.  Now, I just want to see more high caliber content in Amazon's app store.And that's about my two cents on the Kindle Fire.  If you're looking for a tablet experience that's a fantastic value for a great price, then look no further.

It keeps me focused on my workouts (cardio) and makes the time go by faster. I have always either bought my own books or end up borrowing books from the local library. I've been contemplating on getting myself a Kindle since I've always loved the feeling of paper in my hand and moving from one page to another.I am glad I made my switch to the Kindle Fire. Buying books is easy and fast and I don't have to wait for it to be delivered to my house. I don't need to park my car to pick up my books from the library and it's convenient for me.Upon receiving my Kindle, I was surprised by the weight. The size is perfect, it is a bit heavier than I expected but it's not a bad thing. The packaging was perfect and I didn't get the Kindle Fire plastered on the box like other reviewers have mentioned. Mine was a simple Amazon packaging in a nice Kindle box.Connection to WiFi was easy. It does not support ad-hoc or peer-to-peer internet connection as I was unable to connect it to my smartphone tethering - again, not a big deal. I have wireless connection at home and am able to get wifi connection at work. I download my books to my device and it's available to read without any wifi connection - perfect for the gym.I don't see any downside to it.

Well America...listen up...the Kindle Fire is it! The 7 in screen is a perfect size for everything I want to do. I have been an Amazon customer for many years and was already sold on the whole cloud thing but the addition of Prime and the integration with the Kindle Fire is sweet. I have my entire iTunes library in the cloud now and have downloaded loads of books and movies and just love my Kindle Fire. The set up was so quick. When I power it on and see see my name listed and understand that all of my cloud content from years of Android smart phone use was there waiting for me I must say I felt very valued as a customer. Amazon really gets it when it comes to service. Several times a week I get emails from Amazon telling me about the latest Kindle book special on sale or the $1.99 movie deal of the day. When was the last time Apple did that for you? Here's the bottom line. The Kindle Fire is not an iPad killer but you know what? It doesn't need to be.

(Yay, early Christmas!)I have a Velocity Cruz - 7\" screen with regular Android OS, but as with many of the non Apple or mainline tablets, there was no way to access the Android market and most of the Amazon apps I purchased wouldn't run on it. I mainly used the Cruz to read on a Kindle app, and to play lame games. I have a smartphone that was maxed on space with Amazon apps, as well.The great things about the Kindle Fire are that everything I use or want runs smoothly and fast on this tablet. While I am fairly tech savvy, I found that the skin over the Android OS is actually better for the 'uneducated' tech person - it is fairly common sense, and the ease of use. I had to read my whole Cruz manual in order to get it to do functions that should have been common sense. Not so with Fire - I spent about 10 minutes orienting myself on it last night and had all my stuff loaded and up on it and spent the rest of the night having fun! (I struggled with the Lending Library but that was me and NOT the Fire - I kept doing the wrong thing!)I know others are complaining about the lack of gmail, etc. I have those on my Google smartphone, so it's not a problem for me. I also know that the internet browser is extremely fast so I actually got my Gmail that way faster than my phone could bring up the app this morning.I have not had any problem with WiFi signal (always a major issue for the Cruz), and am super happy with the ability to dim the backlighting, etc.While I understand some of the complaints on here, I don't find these faults of a new system. I find that people expect too much or don't understand what they are buying. Before he ordered this, my husband had me do several days of research on the Kindle pages and FAQs to make sure that it would do what I wanted it to do. I did, and I am super happy with the product - the Cruz went bye-bye this morning! While this may not be the Apple killer, for the price point I am happy. I do pictures with a digital point and shoot or my phone, so the lack of camera doesn't bother me, and there is a way to 'side load' content if I choose to. However, I am pretty happy getting my content onto the Cloud, and anytime I travel the destination usually has WiFi (unless we go somewhere tech free on purpose anyway!)While I'm sorry that some people aren't happy with the Fire, I am perfectly happy with mine. Best advice - read the info before you buy so that if it's not going to do what you want, then don't buy it and become unhappy!Amazon has really hit it out of the ballpark. I'm not worried about 3G (or 4G or whatever it becomes tomorrow) because it kills battery power, and I am happy with the size and weight (it weighs less than the same sized Cruz).

The kindle fire is for the most part everything that is advertised with a few caveats.  I like the design but would like to have had a volume control button since going through the menu to change the volume is more steps than necessary.  The screen is crisp and looks on par with video for the category and netflix and prime videos look good.  However, it sometimes takes too long to register a tap or to zoom in and out.  My overall impression was the the whole experience was a bit sluggish from starting up apps or moving from one step to the next.  The browser is not as fast as advertised though I understand that there needs to be more users to figure out what sites are visited most often to be optimized.  Still, heavy data sites take too long to load.  Flash video is a fine addition but that too takes long to buffer and the quality is not very good with too much jaggedness.  My overall opinion is that the interface needs refinement.  It lacks fluidity going from one screen to another.  I bought this tablet with the hope of utilizing it to read pdf files and mostly media consumption but the limitations from the screen size to the amount of memory, even with the cloud just don't fit my lifestyle.  And one thing that just might be annoying to me is the fact that the tablet is slippery and I have a tough time holding onto it with one hand.

Dickstein", "ReviewID": "RD8S7OYUQX4VP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's very simple. If you want an ipad and you can afford it. Go with the ipad. You are not going to be satisfied with the Fire. If you think the Fire can replace your obsession for an ipad, you're forever going to look at the Kindle Fire like the Honda Civic you bought when you had a shot to get a BMW. However, if you don't want to spend $500 on a basic ipad and rather spend around $200, the Fire is definitely a device you should look into.I look at this not as a pro and con post, because my cons are not necessarily cons to you. I look at this as a matter of WANTS and NEEDS. I will list the features that the Kindle Fire does and does not have, things it does well and things it does poorly. At the end, if you have a giant list of \"needs\" in the section where the Fire is missing, then definitely look at other options for tablets. However, if most of the things the Fire are missing are \"wants\" or \"don't needs\" for you, then this tablet might be the right answer.Exterior - First thing you notice about the Fire is it's sleek all black design. The tablet is not too heavy or too thick for you to keep in one hand. Unlike the ipad, it doesn't get too hot after a long period of usage. No camera, no mic, so you won't be able to skype using the device.Display - Currently the Fire only offers a 7 inch display. It is anti reflective and it feels durable. I have no issues with a 7 inch screen but some people might prefer a larger screen to watch videos on.Storage/Cloud - You get a quick sense that Amazon is pushing their cloud drive with the way they set up the Fire storage. Only 8 GBs of storage (probably around 7 GBs with the OS) and no SD card slot for expansion. Their Cloud system is very integrated with the device. Everything you upload to their cloud system pops up on the Fire instantly. The issue with that is you will need a wi-fi connection when you want to access your contents. This situation might make it difficult to use if you travel a lot and won't have many easily accessible wi-fi spots.Interface - This was an area of concern for me. I wouldn't say I am an Apple \"fanboy\", but I am definitely a big fan of their tablet and iphone interface. The Fire's interface was good, but not great. The apps, music, videos, web were all easy to access, and it's response time is pretty quick compared to some of the other tablet at it's price point like the HP touchpad.Apps - The other concern was the lack of apps for the kindle store. And it seems like Fire definitely is losing the battle here. Half the apps I would have liked on my tablet like mint, bank of America, integrated Facebook and twitter, and yelp are all currently missing from the Fire. To get to facebook or twitter, the best option currently is to access it through the browser.E-Reader - Like the ipad, I can't read on the Fire due to it's backlight. Hurts my eyes way too much if I stare at it for a long period of time. I'm glad I kept my Kindle 3 around. If the backlight doesn't bother you too much, then this is a pretty good e-reader. The page turns respond to your touch well, and you can skip chapters and sections pretty quickly. Amazon also gives you the option of borrowing 1 book per month, which is pretty cool for people who want to try some books for free.MP3/Video - Another aspect that I was worried about. But it plays music and video very well. If you have Amazon Prime (which I highly recommend), you can stream TV shows and Movies very easily with the Fire. The videos are in good quality, the sound from the speakers are loud and clear. The only issue I had was that there wasn't an easy way to turn up or down the volume while watching a video.Amazon is actually taking a $10 loss with every Kindle Fire sold. This is because they are banking of the Fire users to spend some extra money on the extra Amazon features like cloud and amazon prime to fully utilize the Fire and help Amazon turn an overall profit on the Fire.Sure, the Fire is definitely going to lack the \"cool\" factor that the ipad brings. With the ipad, you can be that \"cool\" guy at the airport or the \"cool\" guy walking around with the ipad. But if you just want a tablet to check e-mails and surf the web with, and don't really want to spend $500 or more on an ipad, the Kindle Fire is definitely the right tablet for you.", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent product, awesome when price factored in", "Author": "A. Robinson", "ReviewID": "R1P9UOZ15YB4EQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am writing as a veteran iPad user who will never give that up.  There was no issue of comparison in my mind because 1) Amazon has never called the Fire a tablet!  (Be clear on that, people!  This seems to be escaping WAY too many reviewers.)  2) I am not looking to replace the iPad (I use it for much more than just watching media and playing games; it is my mini-office), so weighing them against each other is useless.  I mention only because I want it understood that as a user of the $800 version of Apple's product, I have high standards and expectations.  I know what is possible from a handheld device such as this.  And forgetting the low price point for a moment, the Kindle Fire rocks all by itself.a) The screen has amazing resolution, and the movie and videos I have watched so far were highly satisfactory.  Memory seems sufficient also, so no pauses or skips in streaming.  Viewing experience is very good, or as good as it can be on a 7\" screen.b) The Silk browser operates extremely well, and if its performance improves through repeated usage as suggested, I can only imagine better things ahead.c) Sound quality through headphones is outstanding, with no less clarity than my iPod.d) Email app is very easy to navigate, and far nicer than many cellphones.e) Unit as a whole is extremely intuitive for anyone who has handled a tablet or similar device. The menu bar is right there when one wants it and tucks nicely away as if it knows automatically when it is not wanted.f) App store is adequate for me.  Not having had an Android phone (I am a Blackberry fan), I have not been spoiled with all the Android world can offer. So any limitations from Amazon's app store would not bother me much, and from what I have read, may not bother anyone with the technical knowledge to load their apps in themselves.  I understand much customization is possible with this device.  Even if not, one can certainly guess that the app offerings will continue to expand.WHY I WILL NOT BE KEEPING IT FOR MY OWN USE BUT HOPE HUBBY WILL WANT ITEssentially, what I was looking for was an eReader with some bells and whistles.  I like my Nook, but am disenchanted with B&N;'s pricing structure and Nook product marketing.  I also enjoy listening to music when I read (especially matching the age of the music to the historical setting of the book where possible - I am strange that way LOL!), and I thought it would be fun in between chapters to check my e-mail or Facebook with the device already in my hand.  While the Fire is not marketed as an e-reader, one could reasonably think that, bearing the Kindle name, it would still offer this as a primary and well-developed feature.  Forget reading in direct sunlight, I can't even read clearly in my office with distant fluorescent lighting.  Of course, it would be COMPLETELY unrealistic to suppose that a gorgeous, sturdy, full-color screen would also facilitate a stellar, glare-free reading experience, and I was prepared for that in advance. I just wanted to see for myself exactly where my point of compromise would be, and now I know.  My Kindle Touch 3G has already been ordered.  (Bless Amazon and their six-month no-interest financing policy, to say nothing of their return policy!)Now it IS time to discuss price.  Not a tablet per se - perhaps a large screen smartphone on steroids - however you want to classify it, the Fire is an absolute gem at $200.  Had Amazon not taken the business gamble of selling these devices at a loss, it would still be tempting at $350-400. For the non-Apple addict, or for iPad users who may not feel they get their money's worth from their tablet, purchasing this is a no-brainer. After all, you don't have to have a Cadillac to get around in style and comfort, and this is a terrific product for any media consumer.

It is easy and fun to use and I find that I love browsing the web and watching movies. The wifi works really well for me in places with a good connection (obviously it does not work well when the wifi is bad, just like a laptop).I think the keyboard is the best touchscreen keyboard I have ever used. I have an iPhone and I think this is laid out much better. I love that's the autocorrect gives many suggestions and there is the ability to store words. Also, it is great that you can hold down any of the top keys and get numbers without having to always switch to the symbols page.The device feels sturdy and I love the texture of the back. Overall it feels like a really well made product.As others have said, at times the screen can be a bit unresponsive. I don't find this to happen when typing only when trying to exit out of a youtube video. It is a valid complaint but overall it does not bug me much if I have to click something twice.I am going on a long plane ride next week and I cant wait ti fill to fill with movie for the trip.Overall I am a very proud Fire owner and truly recommend it for anyone looking for a small Internet and entertainment device.----My partner surprised me with a Fire today knowing how badly I wanted one and it has been a joy. It is just as intuitive as expected and feels very solid. I was impressed by the speed of the browser and the ability to watch embedded video.

If you actually took the time to read up on this device, watch explanations of it, or research at all you would know what it is designed for and what it excels at. The problem is, many of the people giving negative reviews of the Kindle Fire DIDN'T do that. Or it's also the case that their problems with it are foolish or idiotic.Let me spell out for you what this device is for:1. If you want to watch netflix on the go, this device is amazing.2. If you want to play some games or let your kids play games, this device is amazing.3. If you want to listen to music around the house or in coffee shops (wifi hotspots), this device is amazing.4. If you want to rent movies/buy movies from amazon instant, this device is amazing.5. If you want a portable tablet, this device is amazing.6. If you want to quickly check email, facebook, or twitter. This device is amazing.7. If you want to watch things like youtube videos, this device is amazing.8. If you want to have an e-reader you can hold in one hand with good quality, this device is amazing.Things it's not designed for:1. Heavy internet use.2. Android marketplace.3. Customization4. Storing lots of music and movies \"On the device\" (uses cloud storage)5. Media creation (no mic, cameras, etc)You MUST understand these things before buying it. The negative reviews usually fall under 3 categories of people: 1. The technologically illiterate who didn't research before buying. 2. The android/android market fan boys who are angry for no reason. Or 3. The Apple fan boys comparing it to their Ipad's.Let me tell you, this device is amazign for what it is supposed to do. I love it. I play some games, watch a movie or tv show, check my facebook, watch youtube videos, read a book, and I'm happy. This is what it is made for. It doesn't replace a laptop, it's an extra media device. It doesn't kill an Ipad either, because it's not supposed to. It's $199, and for that price it's basically a no brainer if you have netflix and a no brainer period if you don't already have a tablet. $199 is like nothing.

It learns what you like and makes recommendations like the amazon website itself. It come w/prime for a month, making it like netflix. It is super responsive--those who say different befuddle me. What are they doing differently from me? Its an ANDROID--HELLO! While some apps offend me with mediocrity (try the weather channel app on the fire, then the iPad; where's the eagle feather on angry birds, or birdday) this gives you freedom to make this device your own.I use the web on the fire almost exclusively. I only pick up my laptop when I have to--the last website I had to do that do was autozone.com. I couldn't pick my car without finishing on a blank green screen.Battery is awesome. It blows a laptop away, and runs a close race with other tablets. Gave to a pack of kids to play angry birds and 6 hours later they gave up, not the fire.Cons: I had some stern conversations with my daughter about buying something, and I still help her get to the prime movies. They really need to fix that.I wish it did epubs. Amazon likely wont allow that. My religious literature is epub and wont be on the amazon store, so my iPad does that well. It lands in ibooks and allows highlighting, notes, etc.I wish it was Multi person friendly. The latest update is a large step toward that but I really need a pin or password on buying stuff.So in closing I gave it 5 stars because the nextbook and (b)lackberry playbooks, well, suck.

It's not a perfect tablet, but I hope a future update will address what I feel are the most annoying issues, i.e., the carousel of recently viewed apps/items. Although I've already taken care of this minor annoyance by side-loading the Ice Cream Sandwich Launcher App, no rooting required.On the Kindle Fire video playback is very good (although I do have a good internet connection, up to 6.0 Mbps) I've viewed videos via Amazon VOD, Netflix, and Hulu Plus Apps, video streaming is smooth and crisp with very little buffering during playback and I can adjust the volume control during video playback without significant difficulty.Where the Kindle Fire really shines, in my opinion, is during game playing, my favorites games so far are Angry Birds, Cut the Rope, and Random Mahjong, the graphics are beautiful, and the touch screen is very responsive, which makes playing games a whole lot of fun!A couple days ago, I install the Skifta App and I can now stream mp3 files from my network-attached storage device, desktop and laptop computers, and I've had no problem with Wi-Fi connectivity and/or weak signal strength. While reading for long periods of time (2-3 hours) I do prefer the E-Ink display of my Kindle Keyboard, but reading eBooks on the Kindle Fire is still a good experience.I am surprise at how much I enjoy accessing my email accounts with the Kindle Fire. Overall, the Fire has met all of my expectations; I wanted a small tablet that would fit in a purse, with quick and easy access to eBooks, music, video, and games, at a great price point, and the Kindle Fire delivers.Admittedly, my review may be influence by my frequent use of Amazon's ecosystem, as a Prime member, I make numerous purchases each year from Amazon; I buy eBooks, music, videos, electronics, and lots of other stuff.

I have always preferred the Amazon ecosystem (Movies, TV Shows, Books) over Apples because it is just simpler to purchase or rent the content from any browser (or buy a season pass) and have, for example, the TV show just show up in our TiVo's Now Playing List.  All the content I have purchased is always available from the cloud without having to have lots of local storage to store and backup the content.  Apple is trying to catch up with iCloud but it still doesn't work with Movies and iCloud is still a little cumbersome and confusing to get it setup and working/syncing correctly among multiple devices (which is unlike Apple in most areas but is reminiscent of the MobileMe issues).  Then when Amazon added the free content for Amazon Prime members (which I was already), it was great but not available on any mobile devices.  Enter Kindle Fire which is a great device and perfect size for content consumption making it the perfect device to sit right in between the iPhone and Mac Laptop.  You can do just enough work to occasionally leave the Mac Laptop home--or use LogMeIn to access your computers left at home and you can really do anything!  And the bigger 7\" screen is much better for watching a movie or reading a book/magazine than on the iPhone!  So the iPhone is always with me and either the Kindle Fire or MacBook Air is brought along depending on the main purpose of the trip (Work=MBA and Fun-Kindle Fire).  Either way all my Amazon content is always available in the cloud.

It is an amazing tablet device that will do almost all the things a bigger and more powerful tablet can do at a fraction of the cost! I have had the fire for about a week now and have had all sorts of tech devices from droids, iphones, ipads, and nook color even! i am very happy with my purchase of the kindle fire for many reasons:1) the fire has great build quality. The screen is clear and crisp and there are absolutely no nuances or flaws about the way the device looks! Many times I am able to find a flaw in a tech device (nook color i'm looking at you with the horrible screen refresh rate) but i can't find one with the fire!2) Amazon services! If you are a prime member you will love this device. Movies and TV shows stream beautifully and shopping is seamless and easy. Not to mention the vast amount of applications in amazon's own app store.3) Device is for the most part fluid, smooth, and promising. Browsing works well, and reading books and magazines is a joy! I know many reviewers put a negative on the screen size, but text view and pinch to zoom make magazine reading easy!4) Cost!!! It is a no brainer at $199. For that amount you can buy one and have a lot of money left over for apps and accessories. This was a problem in the past when i bought expensive devices (ahem Ipad) and found myself feeling guilty and not wanting to buy any apps since i dropped so much $$ on the device itself!Even though i gave this five stars, i do have some negatives that I am sure will be worked on with a software update or over time:1) Glitchy performance does happen from time to time. Yes I have had a few force closes as well as occasional hiccups on the main user interface. Sometimes touching an icon once doesn't do the trick, and a second tap is needed. It is aggravating, but i am almost sure is easy to patch with an update.2) Silk Browser - now although the browser works well, it is not as fast as Amazon has hyped it up to be, but i will give it the benefit of the doubt since I realize that SIlk is suppose to gather data relevant to users over time. I will update this review maybe a month from now and see if i notice any speed changes. It is still rather zippy, but i do think ipad and other tablets have the upper hand. Very curious to see what happens with time and with all the data amazon is storing for split browsing capabilities.3) screen brightness - again almost positive this will be patched with a software update since the same thing happened with my old nook color. It does not dim down enough! Even at the lowest setting, the brightness can still light up a dark room! This is not the best experience when reading something right before bed! I like to dim the screen down as low as possible so that it doesn't affect the eyes as much while reading with the lights off. Just a little nitpick thing of mine, but I am sure it can be fixed.All in all if you are looking for a wonderful \"consumption\" device at a great price then look no further! If you are a prime member and a user of amazon's services you will love having the fire with it's whisper sync capabilities and the ease of use it offers to amazon customers. No this is not an Ipad, not even close, and was never meant to be one! it is not the greatest \"productivity\" device, but it can do almost all of what the ipad can do in a smaller more affordable package that works seamlessly with the services of one of the greatest companies we have come to know.", "Date": "November 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire is on Fire", "Author": "Randy", "ReviewID": "R3VX2OZOL5HQPB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Purchased the Kindle Fire for my wife last night and she loves it. Before I continue with the review I want to say the we already own the first generation iPad.  I know comparing the two is like comparing apples to oranges but after 24 hours with the Kindle Fire I would take it over the iPad any day. I hear some of the complaints that it only has 8GB of hard drive space or it only has 512MB but it didn't affect my decision to buy it instead of buying the Nook tablet. There are some key items that make the Kindle Fire the logical choice over the Nook Tablet.1. Amazon Cloud Storage (5GB Free) but unlimited storage for all digital items you purchase from Amazon2. Amazon Cloud Music player3. Amazon Music is in MP3 format so you never have to convert from AAC to MP3 as with Apples proprietary format4. Reads Word, PowerPoint, Excel and PDF documents.  You can even email yourself your docs to view on the Kindle. You get a Kindle email account (jdoe@kindle.com) that you email your documents to and then you SYNC your Kindle Fire to the cloud and it downloads the attachments.5. Amazon is like your one stop shopping location.  You can buy anything from Amazon.The only thing that really irritated me was when my wife attempted to buy a subscription to a magazine it would not allow us to download it to the Kindle Fire because the Fire had an update.  In order to update the Fire I had to go to my computer and download it. I then had to connect my Kindle Fire to the computer via USB (USB cable does not come with the Fire).  It just happens that the same connector on my myTouch 4G phone is the same for the Kindle Fire so it was easy to connect to the computer.  I'm not sure why Amazon doesn't allow the update to be downloaded straight from the Internet to the Kindle.  Maybe in future updates this will be allowed.Hope this helps those trying to decide between the Fire and Nook.", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Exactly what I expected", "Author": "K.

I read a couple of negative reviews to see what people were saying... wifi issues... book lending through Overdrive.... they seemed to amount to people who did not know what they were doing.  I opened up the box, turned it on and went through the startup, inputing my wifi passcode etc.  It connected and immediately updated itself.  No problems.  I was off and running.  I immediately borrowed a book from Amazon and took in a couple of trial subscriptions.  Book reading was what I expected it to be, like a kindle.  I encountered no issues.  I then read an issue of Discover and was happy to see that I could toggle between the text view and publication view (to see the published form), great!  I was also happy to see that Puffle Launch was free on the Amazon market on Saturday, my kids loved it!  I was also able to utilize Amazon's cloud and play the music that I previously upload from my home computer to the service.  I made a playlist of X-mas music and set it on a bookshelf on the Kindle homescreen and can just click it and have it play through my stereo (connected via the headphone jack).  My kids also had me buy the old Super Friends with the Legion of Doom, so we streamed this to the Kindle flawlessly.As far as email.  I did set up my Gmail account to read it, but to be honest I have an Android phone and mainly use my phone for this task.  For true productivity (word processing etc.) I use my home computer, a PC.This is a great entertainment device, books, magazines, music, movies, apps.  That's exactly what I bought it for!So why 5 stars?  Content is still in some way priced to high to allow for unfettered consumption. For example the NY Times is too pricey at $20/month.  For $7.99 a month I'll get the Times electronically but for $20 a month I'll look to free content on the web, NY Times headlines, CNN, MSNBC, USA Today etc.....  Amazon, exert a little influence on them, perhaps a special deal for Prime members?  The same goes for Amazon's video service, it needs more current offerings for $1.99, too many are at $3.99.  For that amount, I'll drive to Redbox.  If you want be to buy a lot of content, decrease prices.

I've had my Fire since November 15th and it's been completely hassle free.  It took me longer to open the box than to actually set it up and the box was easy to open.  I have tried all the facets that were advertised to come with the product and they all work fine. Which leads me to my next comment, why do people expect that they, and they alone, might expect to receive options with their Fire that are clearly not in the description, such as a camera, microphone, 3G, etc.  I personally always read and understand clearly what I am supposed to get with my product and I am not disappointed. Actually, it's much more than I anticipated. So far, I have not spent a lot of money on books, I've been downloading mostly free books and  ninety nine cent'ers but I did happily take advantage of the Lending Library and quickly read through my prize. The free Prime movies stream effortlessly on my home wifi and the books I chose to download are on my device, in literally seconds, never more than a minute.

I did *not* want or expect a tablet, and thus was not interested in the features which are not present on this device. If you want a _tablet_, then I would recommend getting an iPad.UNWRAPPINGThe box contains mainly two pieces: the device and the charging cable. The device is pre-registered to your account, however it requires an initial sync to download all the content. I received mine on 11/16, which is when a lot of people also received theirs. I easily connected it to my Wi-Fi, but when it came to synchronizing everything, the Amazon servers seemed overloaded and that entire process took around 30-45 minutes, during which time I couldn't do much on the device other than browsing. That being said, I expect the experience to be very smooth once the rush dies down.SOFTWARE EXPERIENCEThe software is very minimalistic (which I consider a positive). The global settings can be accessed from the top of the screen, and the contextual options are accessed through the bottom. The home screen contains tabs for the main functionality (reviewed below), the carousel and the favorites. The carousel animation is smooth, although I found the value of its existence rather limited. I've read on other reviews that people are worried about the privacy aspects of having everything you've accessed recently  available and not editable, but personally that doesn't bother me. I just haven't used it. The integration with the Amazon Store is extremely smooth - every page contains a link to the store, drilled down into the specific area you were exploring (books, movies, apps etc.). In order to make this experience smooth, 1-click purchases get enabled, which does make it challenging if you want children to use this device, or if you're sharing the device. From a security perspective, you can add a passcode on the lock screen (which I strongly recommend), but that's about it. As far as typing goes, the keyboard is probably on par with other tablet devices out there, but I found the auto-correct being less complete than I'm used to, but I probably just got spoiled with my WP7.HARDWAREThe device is a little heavier than I'd like, and it's definitely not as polished as the other Kindles. That being said, it's a nice size, and fits nicely in your hands. It's lighter than the iPad, so you can actually hold it like a book. The controls (power button, headphones & USB port) are on the bottom, and while some people mentioned turning off the device accidentally, I've never had that happened. I credit that to the cover, which has one of the \"hooks\" next to the button, thus making it harder to hit accidentally. The battery is what I would expect - for my usage, I have charged it once in three days. Personally, as long as the device lasts more than one day, it doesn't bother me. Obviously the charge time will not last as long as the eInk Kindles.BOOKSThis is the primary reason I got this: I read a lot of non-fiction books, which previously looked horrible on the eInk Kindle. Doing a side-by-side comparison with the iPad, the Fire is easier to read. For reading a book for a few hours (2-3) at a time, the Fire works out great. If you typically read books for longer period of times, it will most likely strain your eyes, so get one of the eInk Kindles. I have not yet read outside in direct sunlight, but I suspect it will have some issues. Purchasing books is very easy, accessing them is intuitive, flipping through the pages is smooth, highlighting & notes can easily be added, and your latest location is synchronized across all your Kindle devices/applications. Technical books & PDFs look great, and you can easily pinch zoom to get better clarity.MAGAZINESThe selection of magazines on Amazon is pretty large, and again, they make it very easy to subscribe. You get one 14-day trial, and most of the subscriptions are between $1.49-$4.99 per month. Due to the screen size, the books \"look\" better on the iPad, but I didn't find that readability is affected since I can easily pinch zoom and read the article. The only thing I found missing is that you cannot add notes to magazines, which is something supported on books.MOVIESPrime membership gives you free *streaming* to a lot of movies and shows. Purchasing will give you local movies for offline viewing. I watched a couple of HD movies, which was very smooth. I expect with time the library will grow in size.APPSNot all Android apps are supported on the Fire (yet). There's a pretty wide selection of apps & games, which can easily be purchased and installed as expected. The apps that are pre-loaded cannot be removed, and they include Facebook, Email, IMDB, Weather. The built-in Email app supports most providers (Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail etc.), as well as general POP3 & IMAP. Exchange is not supported yet, but you can get the Enhanced Email app for free which does have it. Apps can be pinned just like books on the home screen.BROWSINGThe browser is pretty simple as well. It would be nice to be able to hide the top bar, but again you can pinch zoom. Some people have complained about the loading time for pages, but I haven't noticed that as an issue, although I have not compared it side-by-side with an iPad.

I wanted a dedicated eBook reader.  Though I have a Kindle app on my iPad, I wanted this to supplement my use of electronic technology.Like any other tablet, this device has the capabilities to run applications, surf the web, play MP3s and run electronic books.  For the price, size and capabilities, this dual core processor tablet is a great value.OperationI charged my Kindle Fire immediately upon receiving it.  Set up was extremely simple.  First of all, being a WIFI only device, connecting to my home network was seamless and simple.  Next, synching my Kindle Books with the device from the Cloud made the transition from an iPad to my Kindle Fire easy.  Subjectively, the download time seemed faster when downloading my books.This is an entirely touch screen device with the exception of the power button.  Navigation through the operating system is quite simple.  I would have appreciated a mechanical home button, but the touch screen is so responsive that it is not necessary.The onscreen keyboard is a standard QWERTY keyboard.  There is an autocorrect function like many Smartphones and Tablets.  Operation is identical and no complicated gestures are necessary to learn.A menu system allows complete customization of features, including password security.  It is intuitive for those already familiar with eBooks or Smartphones.  I never needed to refer to the user manual.Being a touchscreen, the advantage is having a screen that functions in any environment - sunny, ambient light or total darkness.  Contrast and detail is excellent.  Your only tradeoff with the other Kindle devices is battery life.In my use, I have not needed to synchronize this device with a laptop/desktop, unlike the iPad/iPhone.  This is the major advantage over the Apple line of products, which requires synchronizing with iTunes for EVERY device.  Set up of the Kindle Fire took virtually 10\" for me (apart from charging it).Parental controlLike every other device these days, if your child will be accessing it, you want parental control.  This allows complete control of content and internet access.Battery lifeBattery life is similar to an iPad which is about 8 hours without WIFI.  I run brightness at 25% to make it last a little longer.ApplicationsThe library of applications is not as extensive as the iTune store, but there are more than enough applications to keep you busy.  It is not my objective to run apps so my experience on this device is limited.Kindle booksWith the Cloud, all books are available.  Additionally, it serves as an e-reader for documents and PDF files by forwarding documents to your Kindle specific account.  Navigation through a text is simple and is touch screen operated.  Highlighting, taking notes, and bookmarks make this as efficient as a hard copy.  The beauty of the device is the ability to have WhisperSync which synchronizes your changes through all devices (i.e. Kindle for iPad/Mac/iPhone, Kindle Fire, etc).Amazon PrimeI am an Amazon Prime subscriber and the ability to access movies on the Fire is a big plus.  There are a lot of movies to choose from.  It also allows the user to check out books from a multitude of titles for free (one book per month limit).  Surfing on the web, such as the Amazon web site, allows for a seamless transition between an eBook reader/multimedia operation and making electronic purchases.MP3sThe Cloud saves all music purchases and does not count against the free storage limit.  This is another advantage of the Kindle Fire over other similar devices.Sound qualityFor a multimedia device, this is acceptable from built in speakers but not great.  The headphone capabilities make it function well.Image qualityImage quality of the screen is excellent for movies, texts and internet.Ideal usersStudentsMobile professionalsMobile usersVirtually anyoneOverallThis device is a winner, hands down.  For the price, capabilities and functionality, I look forward to the Kindle Fire 2.", "Date": "August 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Both the Kindle Fire and Amazon Customer Service are 5 Stars", "Author": "Angela Streiff", "ReviewID": "R18YWADRS16W8J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had my Kindle Fire since November 2011, and decided after many months of use to finally create a review for it. Not only have I used it this long, but I also just had to work with Amazon Kindle Customer Service for the first time, and can now go into detail about my experience with them.To begin, I love my Kindle Fire. I use it almost every day for many different things. I surf the internet on it constantly, buy and listen to MP3s, play lots of application games, check the weather and shop on websites sites like Amazon, Woot!, eBay, Newegg and every other kind you can think of. I've paid my bills online using my Kindle Fire, watched YouTube videos, posted on online message boards and comparison shopped hotel rates. I have a beast of a laptop, that's super powerful I can take with me when I travel, but I never do. My Fire does everything would need it too, and so I just take it.The Fire has quickly become my main MP3 player, since I can easily buy music and download it right to the Kindle in just seconds. Any speakers using a 3.5mm jack with work with the Kindle, so even basic computer speakers can be plugged right into the Kindle Fire's earphone jack to play music. I have downloaded apps like Pandora and IHeartRadio, which stream live radio stations and also user created radio stations right over the Kindle Fire.When my son was in the ER a few weeks back, we had a terrible long wait to see the doctor (hours). The hospital had open wifi, so I pulled out my Kindle Fire, launched the Netflix app and logged in. He was able to sit and watch episodes of Sponge Bob while laying on the doctors office examining table waiting for him.Over the last 8 months, the number of times I have found a use for my Kindle Fire has been endless.The glass on the screen has held up beautifully. I am so-so about getting around to putting my Kindle in it's case, so sometimes it was protected, sometimes is wasn't. But it never broke, cracked, chipped or scratched. The touch screen remained very responsive and everything always loaded up quickly and without problems. The 7\" design is perfect for caring around in a bag or purse, but still large enough to see everything on the screen well. I work every day on computers that cost thousands of dollars, but I'm still very enamored with my Kindle Fire, and would not trade it for an iPad. It's not the same thing, as they are very different devices, priced different, different OS and even different in size.When it comes to the price for what you get, it's outstanding. This is a three hundred dollar device with a two hundred dollar price tag. It just does so much and works so well, and has held up without issues that the price seems like a steal.***Amazon Kindle Customer Service***My recent experience with Amazon Kindle Customer Service is what lead me to finally decide it was time to do a review on the Fire. After 8 months of daily usage, I finally had one problem. Last week I was playing music from my Kindle Fire through a speaker dock that was made for the Fire. After a little over an hour of playing music, the speaker started sounding a bit staticy. I detached my Kindle from the dock and found it a bit warm. At that time there seemed to be no problems, and I used the Fire all week. Yesterday I was cleaning in my home and placed the Kindle back into the speaker dock to again play music from it. After about and hour and a half of playing music, the speaker started sounding as though the music was skipping. I went over to again pull my Kindle out of the speaker dock and found the screen frozen and pixelated. I held the power button down on the Fire for a long time, to do a \"hard reset\" so it would shut down. After powering off, it never came back on again. The back of the Kindle Fire was warm, and it seemed as though something inside had overheated and caused the device to stop working.After trying most of the day to get my Kindle to begin working again, I finally called Amazon Kindle Customer Service. I spoke with a very helpful rep who after hearing what all I had done to try and get the Kindle to power back on, deemed the unit dead and informed me she would be sending out a brand new replacement unit, at no cost. I had never bought any protection plan for it or anything like that. This was just how great Amazon Customer Service was. I've paid for service plans for other electronics with other stores, that in the end just flaked out on me as soon as I needed any sort of help. Amazon on the other hand, went above and beyond to help me. Knowing I can get customer service help like that makes all the difference in the world when I'm deciding what company to buy something from. It's an outstanding device and the customer support that comes with it is stellar.

I really didn't want an electronic device to read from - I'm old fashioned & like carting a paper book around, holding it in one hand folded back, flipping back and forth to re-read pages if I needed. I went kicking & screaming until I realized that I don't have anymore space in the house for my favorite books! So I caved and after some extensive research, I bought a Kindle Fire and a pretty pink leather case from Amazon.com - The options were good and the price was right - and it was in color!  I received it in no time flat already programed & ready to start loading it up with books.  I was pleasantly surprised with the feel, weight, size and convenience of reading that I explored it's other uses too.  I like that fact that I can e-mail docs to my kindle like recipe .pdfs or play games the way I do on my iPhone - Go Angry Birds.  I had to wait for HBO Go negotiations for Kindle to complete in June, but now that it's here, I love it - as long as I have internet connection!Here is what I didn't like so much about it ... maybe something to review for upgrades - next generations...It's too easy to accidentally press the power button on the bottom end and I can't count how many times I tried to shut down while I was in the middle of something. I lost all my bookmarks to A Song of Ice and Fire once - that was bad.The power cable connection is very tiny - seems flimsy and also is next to the power button.And while I have WiFi at home -  sometimes I get a weak to no connection (at no fault to the Kindle), it's nice to plug in to the hub to watch movies or surf the Internets.Oh and I still need to research this, but I like to know page numbers rather than a percentage (is there a setting?)I can overlook all that - the good out weighs the negative", "Date": "August 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "A wonderful surprise!", "Author": "Denise", "ReviewID": "RQY9G032WTAN6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, i NEVER thought I would want a Kindle because I LOVE my books and I love the whole experience of reading...turning the page, using a bookmark, etc. On Christmas morning, my brother surprised each of us with a Kindle Fire.

(The charging cord, not the Kindle itself.) I said at that time I would have rated the Kindle Fire a strong four stars (rather than my initial two) were it not for the problems. Since that time, Amazon has offered to replace the original charging unit. Since all I can expect any company to do is stand by its product, which Amazon did, I am giving the Fire its four stars for being a good value and doing what I need it to do.Here are some things I really like about the Fire. It is an e-reader with tablet functionality, and if that is what you need it works very well. I can carry a mountain of books and documents between offices without killing myself, which I personally love. The size is absolutely perfect for easy access to my email and calendar- small enough to be easily portable, but large enough to be read. (Yes, I can use email and calendar on my phone, but goodness it can be hard to read if you have to do much of it.) I am not super tech-savvy and was easily able to set up my wireless connection at work and home. Overall, I find the features accessible and easy to use. Yes, the Kindle Fire is designed to deliver Amazon content, and you need to realize that; but their content (aside from Android apps of course) is generally not designed to favor one operating system over another so you can use it with a wide variety of devices without trouble. I like that since I also have both PC and Apple products at home. Plus, if you are using it for carrying around books and documents, there is a fair amount of storage on the device for that type of stuff and you can always store Amazon content in the cloud. Some folks have complained that you \"need\" Prime membership, but I haven't found that to be the case.

I've had it a little over a month now, so I've had time to use it.  I resisted the idea of an e-reader.

I like watching my progress as I move the bookmark along the pages.  I don't think ALL the new electronic devises are necessarily \"progress\" and I lumped e-readers into the \"not for me\" category.  However, that was before I owned the Kindle Fire.  Oh, my!I visited my parents last week.  Normally, I have LOTS of time to read while we sit and visit. I usually run out of things to read - and it's not long before I'm reduced to scrounging around mom's house looking for anything in print... advertising circulars, cereal boxes, old newspapers ANYTHING.  But with my Kindle Fire, I had a whole library of books - most of them free downloads, including some of the old classics I hadn't managed to read yet.  I downloaded them before beginning the trip (as 79 yr-old mom doesn't have wireless Internet). I could manage the text size to make reading so much easier... my eyes aren't what they used to be!  I'd forgotten how effortless reading could be when I didn't struggle with tiny print!I've downloaded a free version of the Bible - and can have access to it whenever I want... no more forgetting to bring it along or regrets when I don't have the room in my luggage for my big volume.

I would only borrow books or buy very inexpensive ones, same for movies, as it seems awfully expensive to have a movie you can only see on a 7 inch screen. The thing I also compare this too is our son got a leapfrog leappad and while about 70 dollars less, once you buy the accessories and the games, I have way more invested in his toy that this..and if someone said they were wondering about buying one or the other, I would side on buying the kindle.

I've vacillated between the various brands (Android Vs. iPad) and just couldn't justify the cost vs. features I would actually USE on a consistent basis to justify the investment. I primarily use my laptop along with my EVO phone. I also read a lot, but still prefer the old fashioned paper model known as a book. My husband then declared he wanted a tablet to surf the web and watch movies; I was on a mission to find the right one.I didn't need a tablet with a ton of fancy, and very unlikely to be used features, but one that focuses on the important features (web & movies) I want. It was imperative that the device DO THEM WELL.When Amazon's Gold Box deal offered reconditioned Kindle Fires @ $139.99 I decided to join the tablet crowd by ordering one.  I was slightly concerned because essentially \"reconditioned\" means used and perhaps even defective, but at least I could return it within 30 days if there were any problems.  Right out of the box, this Kindle has been outstanding.The one thing I did do before it was delivered was to go to YouTube and watch various Kindle Fire tutorials that demonstrated the basics of how to turn it on, navigate through the features, and how to use the controls. Once I took it out of the box (looking spanking brand new), I had a basic understanding of how it worked.  I pushed the button, swiped the screen with my finger, and it was ready to go. Since I watched the tutorials, I knew how to get it connected to my home wifi without a hitch. There is, however, a user manual located in the Kindle that's easy to access. We were also easily able to connect to public wifi.I downloaded a few free books and I found the text to be easy to read. Another nice feature is having a dictionary preloaded .  If I happen to come across a word that I do not know the definition, I simply hold my finger down on the word and the definition pops right up on the screen. I have to admit, that's one nice feature if your reading something that contains challenging vocabulary.  I read a few children's books using this Kindle and though I thought that this is a unique way to expose children to books, I don't think it will ever replace a nice picture BOOK.The picture is clear and razor sharp; the touch screen responsive, and the colors vibrant.If you have an Android phone, you will find the operating system in the Kindle Fire familiar as well as the formatting.  My husband uses a Samsung Epic and being the non-tech man he is, he was able to learn to navigate through the features and download aps with ease.  He's been able to do exactly what he wanted: websurf and watch movies on a portable device.  Granted, it's a Kindle so it is set up to encourage consumption of Amazon products, but that's not an issue for him.My recommendation is that before you purchase any tablet, be clear about how you intend to use it. If you plan on using your tablet beyond basic personal use, perhaps Kindle Fire isn't for you. Also understand that the screen is seven inches and is on the small end of tablet size spectrum.  If you want access to hundreds, or even thousands of aps (though Amazon is getting more everyday), Kindle Fire may not be the appropriate tablet for you.  It operates exclusively on wifi and 3G internet access is not an option. This Kindle is also small on storage, but you do get free Amazon Cloud storage with your purchase.Overall, I'm very happy and satisfied", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazon and Kindle Fire Exceeds expectations", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RZFBVAOHSNJTK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been interested in obtaining a device for some time primarily for reading.  My wife has an IPAD and I have an iPhone, both with Kindle software on them.  The IPAD is a bit heavy, and the iphone's screen is to small. So do I wait for Apple to come out with a smaller version of the IPAD or buy an e-reader?  Sure it would be nice to have one single device to do all the functions I need, but seriously, I like my iPhone for the purposes it services, but it is not a great reader.  I purchased my first Kindle (Keyboard) for my mom this past Christmas.  I liked the functionality, but for me, I did not really like the black and white screen.  I wanted a similar reading device that had color and some multimedia capabilities.I ordered my Kindle online from the Amazon store. I tried Prime a couple or years ago, and decided to sign back up for it last fall, in order to get streaming videos on my DVD Player (after Netflix made some of the stupidest marketing moves I have ever seen).  So when I ordered my KF, I also got free two day shipping.  That was a lie. I had it in my hands 23 hours later. Thanks Amazon.After reading some of the negative reviews, I was concerned about both technical functionality, design and usability. The Fire exceeds my expectations on all three.  I am clearly impressed with Kindle's software, and ease of use.  Could I complain about little things like the on off button location, lack of wireless sync, etc.?  Sure. But I am not going to, for one simple reason.  PRICE.  The IPAD 2 is $200 more expensive.  The IPAD 3 is $300 more.  There are some Android tablets that may have the from factor for a similar cost, but I had an Android phone once and was clearly not impressed.  Understanding that Kindle uses Android, the user interface differences is what clearly sets it apart form Android devices.I consider my self more of a techie than others. I have been a longtime user of Apple products, and appreciate their products and their business.  I have also seen Apple make business decisions that are designed to increase their market share at the expense of end user functionality (e.g. Adobe Flash). Netflix has stymied me on how a great company could become so mediocre.  Amazon has made mistakes as well (i.e I remember first time I tried to cancel my prime trial).

The Kindle Fire is NOT an Android tablet or iPad.  Yes, it does run on a modified version of Android, but it's specs are more similar to a smart phone.  If you expect it to fill the role of a full tablet, you might be seriously dissapointed.  Instead, think of it as an evolution of the original Kindle.  The Kindle Fire exists to allow users easier access to their Amazon content and a TON of awesome extra features.  With that out of the way, I'll talk about my experience with the Kindle Fire.I've bee using mine for about two weeks now and I'm extremely satisfied.  First of all, the $200.00 price tag is just wonderful.  I fully expected to get a slightly more powerful Kindle with a color screen, but I wound up with a device that does everything I want it to and more.  The Amazon app store is pretty large, so you aren't likely to be dissapointed with the selection.  The Kindle elements are all there, too.  You can read books (of course), magazines, comic books, and newspapers with extreme ease.  You can watch movies and television shows in high definitition with great sound thanks to the Fire's two speakers.Those are the Fire's real strong points.  It does plenty of other things, but not as well as a true tablet.  In the end, you're paying $200.00 for the iPod Touch version of the iPad.

In reality, that is a completely unfair comparison. The Kindle Fire is...well... a Kindle! It does what all the other Kindles can do but also, so so much more. It is by no means the best tablet on the market, that honor still belongs to the iPad 2--but I'd say that the Kindle fire is the best \"android\" tablet out there. Even though it is a highly customized build, the Fire still runs an alteration of android. So it's almost comical that the Kindle Fire is the best android tablet, and Amazon isn't even really trying to make a dent in the tablet market--just make a hybrid of an e-reader and a tablet, since the iPad isn't very fun to read books on.Paired with a good anti-glare screen protector (I recommend the one from Acase) to compensate for the overly glossy screen, the Kindle Fire is my ideal device for reading on. Because I've had such a great experience with this kindle--it's my first kindle--I'm really tempted to buy one of the other kindles!

All of these were acquired in search of the best kind of portability for my growing library of Kindle books.  I was pleased when I first discovered the Kindle app for my iPhone because it let me read pretty much anywhere.  This was good enough until I bought an iPad for reasons other than reading and began using the Kindle app on that platform as well.  Then I became frustrated.  The iPhone screen seemed cramped and the iPad was too large to carry around.  It was much like going back to the laptop as far as reading was concerned.The Kindle Fire was an answer to my dilemma.  It is the size of a paperback and fits into the pocket of my jacket--leaving my hands free for Jersey-style conversation.  It suffices as a notepad and I have even found a few useful apps.  It doesn't matter very much to me as a game platform nor as a device for movie-watching.  It's mostly about reading books as far as I am concerned.  It works well for that.There are just a few negatives.  The lack of 3G/4G connectivity is an inconvenience.  I'd like to be able to get a new book anytime the way I can on my iPhone--and I'd be willing to pay extra for this.  I really don't like scrounging around for wireless access every time I visit a new place.  It makes me feel like that new kid who wanders around the neighborhood bleating \"Will anybody play with me?\"  Ugh.Of course I'd like more memory and a faster processor.  And the Kindle Fire clearly was not designed by Apple.  It's too thick, feels \"plastic\" in the hand, and its off/sleep button is awkwardly located.  But it also wasn't priced by Apple.  For what I want from it most--a cheap, portable way to read books--it is just fine.  Just as I don't fault a paperback when it lacks the heft, sturdiness, and scent of a quality hardback, I can't fault the Kindle Fire for not being an iPhone or iPad.So the Kindle Fire gets high marks from me.

I love the smell of old books, the looks of a grand-old book-self and a trip to my local library. Thus it took me loner to get converted to a concept of an e-reader. I bought Kindle Fire with a lot of reservation.I thought, \"Well! It is only $199, and so how much can I go wrong? Besides, I am buying it on Amazon. So, I can always return it.\"However, when I got the gadget and started learning how to use it, I realized there is nothing to learn. It is all very intuitive. I liked it.Although, holding a cold Kindle was very different than holding a well-bound Charles Dickens classic-book! So, I spent a bit more money and got a cover for my Kindle. Now, it felt a little better, and handled more like a book. Well, not exactly, but kind of.As far as functionality is concerned, it is excellent. Reading on it is different. If you read a lot, perhaps the older e-ink version is better for you. But if you are like me: reading a classic and checking my mail same time, you are better-off with this puppy. It buys and brings the books from the Cloud to your lap in an instant and in a frictionless manner. Since this happens on Amazon, I am ok with the security and privacy of my transaction. Well, it is better than most of its class.One aspect of Kindle has changed my reading habits. I can check the dictionary without breaking my reading, my imagery, and my thought-process. I just have to touch the word a little longer, pops the meaning, I see and proceed ahead: online, real-time.

Here are my evaluations: Setup: I got this as a Christmas gift, and it was very easy to set up, I had to \"de\" register my mom (She bought it on her profile) which was not hard I signed her out and setup my profile/email. I received an email verifying it. Books/Graphic Novels: I was determined to buy this myself; however I ended up getting surprised with it for Christmas so I had four books in my wish list I wanted on my kindle fire. The first one I got I read straight through. I loved the fact you could make the font bigger or smaller and change the color of the page; I changed it to the manila color. After I sped through the first book I bought, I moved on to a comic book I had bought. I was pleasantly surprised you could zoom in panel to panel to read it. The only thing I have a complaint about is using the dictionary that comes with the kindle you can't search for the word you can type in a word but it won't give you the definition. Here's an example, you type in clock it will bring up wherever the word clock is used in a definition but not the actual definition. The Cloud: I had actually used the cloud before I got the kindle so I knew how it worked and how much space was on it, however I was shocked to see how fast the response time is when you put something on the cloud from your computer (like music) to when you see it on your kindle. Music: Many people have been comparing this to the Ipad? I am not sure if they did this to the new nook tablet or if they are just signaling out the kindle fire. The reason I brought this up is because there have been comments about Amazon wanting you to only use music you buy from them blah blah blah, that's not really the case yes you can't transfer music from iTunes to the cloud however you can transfer music from ITunes to your computers media player and then up load it to the cloud. Issue resolved. Video: I have yet to watch a movie on the kindle fire, but I believe it would be enjoyable. I have watched TV shows on the fire, I had some I had downloaded before I got the fire on my cloud (Missed TV episodes) that I watched on my computer and then on the fire; besides the obvious size issue of computer monitors to the fire I enjoyed watching it. I actually bought a season pass to a TV show so all the episodes go straight into my fire. As far as trying to watch them holding the fire I don't think that would work, I have a case that can be stood up sideways so I can watch my TV shows. Back to the I pad comparison the videos I've bought on ITunes can't be put on the fire, at least I haven't figured out a way, but I don't want to pay $1000 for an  Ipad and Ipad accessories so this is a pleasant alternative. Newsstand: I have yet to buy a newspaper/magazine, I've browsed through the choices and I haven't found any I can't live without. Free Trial Membership to Amazon Prime: The Products I bought from Amazon did not have a faster shipping time it was normal to me. I did however consider renewing the membership because I was able to stream TV shows for free and of course the Lending library where you can \"borrow\" kindle books. But as I read through the terms and conditions Amazon put in they have the right to take out those services so I couldn't bring myself to pay $75 for a service that \"may\" be taken away in the future. Apps that come with the kindle: I don't know what a lot of the apps that come with fire are, like Pandora, Pulse, and Audible. I did find the other apps helpful, when I uploaded my email all my contacts got put in the contacts app; I didn't have to do it. The Facebook app is awesome, just an easy way to get on FB. I wish twitter had an app like FB though. Other Apps: Notable apps that I use every day: 1.) PG Calculator: easy to use and it was free. 2.) Roller Lite: Basically its skee ball, so much fun! 3.) Words with friends: I never played this on FB but I love it on the Fire. 4.) Bubble Wrap: I got this because I thought it would get a laugh out of the kids, it's CRAZY how much the kids love this. 5.) Comics App: I wasn't sure I'd like this app only because I prefer normal comics to digital. I was wrong, this app rules! There's an option to either have to go to the full page after you read it or before you read it so you can observe the art. I opted for before but found myself going back after I read it. 6.) Photo Gallery: This is one that came with the fire, but I waited to do it down here, because you don't get a cord to connect to you computer, you have to buy one separately. 7.) Quick office: Right now all I have is the free one, but I am planning on getting the one that costs $14.99. This app is amazing! I'm a writer so to have an app that can read your document to you is very helpful. Docs: This section of the kindle fire is used for reading documents; you can't fix them if there's a mis-spelled word. Amazon gives you a kindle email, usually it's just the first part of your current email, it is a really neat way for Amazon to use the kindle/cloud. The only thing that bugged me was that I used it once and the doc went straight to my kindle. I did not like this option.Overall: I love the kindle fire! I would not trade it for an Ipad.

Our oldest daughter who is in college thought she needed an IPad, but that wasn't in the budget so when we heard about the Kindle Fire we read up on it and decided to get her one.  We ordered it the first day it was available.  While reading up on it both my husband and I decided we wanted one too and so ended up ordering each other one for Christmas.All three of us have been using our new Kindles a lot from the day we opened up gifts and don't have any complaints at all.  We have used it for surfing the web, reading books, watching movies, and playing apps and everything works great.  The Web browsing works just as fast as my brand new laptop computer so I don't know why others are complaining about speed--unless you have a poor wi-fi system to begin with--it's not the Kindle Fire's problem.  Facebook works great too.My husband and I have been using Kindles since they came out several years ago and we both enjoy reading with the new Kindle just as much.  From what I can tell the only downfall as far as reading is battery life.  We take our kindles camping to read and can't charge them easily so we appreciate the longer battery life of the older Kindle's.  Fortunately we still have the older versions so will probably continue using them for that purpose only.As far as a lack of apps, I found plenty of great apps on Amazon.  Granted, there are a few missing, but most of those are already on my phone so I don't consider this to be a big issue--same with the lack of camera.  I already have a phone with a camera so I don't need another anyway.My daughter rented movies from Amazon to pass the time on our 12 hour trip home after Christmas vacation and she loved using her Kindle to watch movies.I also think the menus are great--easy to figure out and nice to use once you do.  And there is literally no real set-up needed once you put in your amazon account information so I was on the Kindle fire and using it in less than 10 minutes.So, my advice would be read about the Kindle Fire before you buy one.  The website describes everything about the device--it's not fair to trash it in a review because you were a poorly informed consumer when all the information is available for you before you buy it.  If the fire doesn't have all the features you want, then save your money and buy something else. However, if you do your research and know what the Kindle Fire offers and don't need more then don't hesitate to order one--they are great little tablets.", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "It's Awesome", "Author": "S.

I refuse to pay laptop prices for the stripped down functionality of the high-end tablets out there, so I was cautiously optimistic when I saw the Kindle Fire come out.  I gave it some time and read all of the industry and consumer feedback I could before finally deciding to take the plunge.  I'm glad I did.Yes, there are annoyances with it.  It is a first generation product, and it does not cost as much as the high-end.  I am not coming into this as an iPad user who is looking for a cheaper iPad; rather, I'm looking for something that I can read books, watch video, listen to music, do some light-weight email and browse the web in a first-class fashion.  I don't need a lot of storage, I might want a video for a flight or something but I don't need to put my huge MP3 collection on it all at once.  The Kindle Fire meets all of those needs quite well.  Here are my overall impressions:Look/FeelKindle gets an A+ here.  It is strikingly beautiful, the screen resolution is outstanding.  The responsiveness of the operating system is good.ControlsKindle gets a B+, maybe an A here.  I am torn because the lack of a physical volume control is somewhat of a pain, but I am also an ex-Zune user and it has the same issue (though the Zune has a physical button to immediately bring up the on-screen controls for volume and track).  So the times that I need to turn the volume down fast, I grumble having to make 2-3 taps to get to the volume control.  However, when I'm watching a video or reading I am really glad the thing isn't littered with buttons so I can hold it however I please and not change things.User InterfaceI heard lots of complains about it not having the normal Android interface.  I've got very few issues with Amazon's interface (and I find Androids to be a less than useful clone of Apple's less than useful interface).  Kindle's interface is speedy and responsive.  It keeps with the book heritage and presents you with a bookshelf that shows you your recent activity in landscape mode or recent activity plus a favorites shelf in portrait mode.  What is missing?  The ability to organize things and create folders (or shelves, or whatever the UI guys decide to call it).  At this early juncture in my experience, it is a limiting factor but not bad.  As I acquire more \"stuff\" on my Kindle and on Amazon's cloud service, I see it being more and more of an issue.Amazon Cloud vs Storage SpaceI really like the cloud service idea.  I wasn't too sure how I'd feel...as a senior leader in an enterprise IT product organization, I sometimes feel as though I will turn a little green and need to leave the room in a hurry when I hear \"cloud\" being thrown around.  But the concept really gels on the Kindle.  I was able to put my complete (and extensive/large) MP3 collection on Amazon's service after purchasing the $20/yr upgrade to the first tier of Cloud Drive which includes UNLIMITED music storage (an awesome option).  I couldn't dream of having all my music available like this before, so this has been great.  I've begun to really adopt the Amazon service model and I like it.That being said, the omission of an SD card slot will be the deal killer for a lot of people.  Some, like myself, can live with the absence and work around it easily enough, but if you are one who wants to have everything with you all the time it just ices the whole thing down.  I realize it was important to meet the price point, but I fully expect Amazon to give into pressure and add a slot to the next generation Kindle (even if the price jumps a bit, I think it'd be OK).  If you are around wifi most of the time like I am, it isn't as big of a deal.SizeI find the size perfect.  The ipad is just too big for me...more like a wanna-be laptop than a tablet.  Phones are too small, but the 7\" screen here is just right.  Big enough to enjoy videos, small enough to be portable.  I have bad eyesight and require fairly strong prescription glasses to get by, and I don't have any issue reading print on the Kindle Fire.  The size does provide some challenges on very small links on web pages, but this can easily be worked around by pinch-zooming the link and tapping it...a fair trade-off for the very few times I've encountered this (plus, this issue is more about idiot web designers who put \"cute\" above \"useful\" in their design priorities and less about the Kindle or its size).Web BrowsingI find the browser to be about 95% \"there\" as a complete and polished product.  It renders almost all of the sites I have visited perfectly.  It has a good tabbed browsing interface, options to load tabs in the background or foreground when you open them, it is easy to open links in new tabs, the bookmarks interface is decent (note to Amazon: please quit blanking out the URL field when the user hits \"next\" on the keyboard...highly annoying!).  As a heavy tabs user, I've found it to be a bit limited in the number of open tabs it supports...I keep running into \"too many tabs open\" and this is forcing a change of my browsing habits in a way I consider a negative.However, after years of seeing only a few browsers ever do a good job of being useful, I applaud Amazon for Silk.  It isn't 100% yet, but it must have been a monumental effort to get as far as they did in time for market.  This is a make-or-break feature and they did it.  It is a solid and sound design and the complaints I have about it really are either device limitations (tab limits due to memory I presume) or obvious bugs I have faith will be fixed before long.  As a long-time software developer, I have sympathy for the guys working hard on this feature and applaud what they have accomplished.SummaryI love this thing.  It has its limitations and bugs, but considering the cost is only a little more than a simple copy of Windows 7 (which has many more bugs!) I'm quite happy.  It fits the needs I outlined in the beginning, and fits them in a surprisingly good way.  I figured one measure of it would be how quickly I felt like I needed to root it and install the Android app store.  In my younger days, I'd have probably done that first thing but as I've aged I have come to the point I just want things to work.  I want computers to enable the things I do as opposed to \"be\" the thing I do.  I don't feel constrained by the Amazon app store yet.  I don't feel I want to root it, although I do wish it had Google Apps available.Buy it!

But if anything it just reminds me that I like the Kindle should take a break and let it and me recharge.But the price is good, and for what this geek toy/device does, it will bring much joy, entertainment, many reading adventures and is highly worth the price and the little bit of learning curve involved in using it.

I was contemplating buying a tablet for streaming videos and searching the web when Amazon came out with the Kindle Fire. I decided to try it out at Best Buy and really liked the easiness of it. I'm really glad I decided to buy this over a tablet because tablets are so expensive and frankly I couldn't afford a 3G network monthly anyway. So, the Kindle Fire was a perfect fit for me. I absolutely love reading books on it and I really thought I would miss reading an actual paperback/hardcover book. I think this is the best purchase I have made in a very long time. If you want the luxury of streaming your netflix or hulu+ videos and having a device for storing books then this is what you want. I have an iPod touch, so I already knew what to expect from an iPad and might have purchased one if I was willing to spend $500 or more on a tablet. I'm really glad I went with the Kindle Fire over an iPad because the kindle was everything I wanted in a tablet. I commute on a train to work every day and it is so much easier to hold a kindle over a book. I don't feel the strain on my neck or in my hands from having to hold it, but I would if I had an actual book with me. I find no difficulty in holding it and turning the pages. I'm waiting for Amazon Prime to have better access to movies and TV before I buy a membership, but I'm glad I could try it out for a month. If I couldn't rent books from a library using my kindle, I would probably consider having the membership for the books only. I love that they have daily deals! They offer some really great books at a great price! I know some people complain that the price of the ebooks are more than the actual book, but if you consider shipping prices and the waiting period I think it balances out and works in favor of the ebook version.", "Date": "December 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Needs more apps...", "Author": "Brandon", "ReviewID": "R70Z3UUS2DU1X", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Don't do a whole lot of reviews, but I'm hoping I can help everyone who wants a little more functionality out of their Fire (also hoping Amazon reads these reviews and listens to the recommendations).

I depend on apps like Dropbox to keep all my files synced so that I can access them anywhere. This is especially important on devices that do not have SD or USB capabilities. I have a Samsung Tab 10.1, and got the Fire because of its small size and portability. I incorrectly assumed that the Android-based OS would support all of the apps offered in the Android Market. I think Amazon has a hit here if they can either #1 - make all of the apps available in Android Market available on the Fire, or #2 - allow Fire owners to download apps from the Android Market that are not offered in the Amazon Market.

This disclaimer is necessary to not upset ipad fan club. This is not meant to compare Fire with any other mobile device in the market. To surmise my findings in one sentence - it's not very often that you get more than what you paid for. That's Kindle Fire for you.  How much more? It's up to every one to decide after reading this post. In my opinion Fire hits that sweet spot of providing you with adequate features with superior performance at a very very affordable price. It's no wonder Fire is flying off the shelf since its launch.I received the Fire in my mail after a month long wait time. I had placed an order on Amazon, immediately after the product announcement basically trusting the good reviews from analysts. Right from the time I opened the box I was hooked. Fire comes in a cardboard box with perforated edge that tears without help from scissors, there are no sticky tapes any where outside or inside the box. I was off and running in less than 5 minutes. The interface is intuitive and easy. It has its own quirks, but they don't  rob you of your quality time.First off, let's get out of our way some well documented and commented on 'lack of features of Fire'. They are, absence of any buttons other than power button. Not having  a button even for controlling volume is kind of annoying. The power button is at the bottom together with micro USB  port and a jack for headphones. Because of the unusual placement of power button, it's possible that Fire goes to sleep by holding it in your lap. But bringing it back to life is easy enough - sliding the switch on the screen like an apple device. The Fire is not exactly light and because of its very thin edges it's hard to hold it in a hand for a long period of time without touching the screen and without slipping through your hands. I would recommend Amazon to provide grooves or impressions/dents on the edges to make it easier to hold.Fire does not have a microphone, neither does it have a camera. So for all those skype fans this could be a serious issue.Now on to the best part.I have used the Fire so far to do almost all my online activities like reading my emails from various personal accounts, using social networks like facebook, twitter, linkedin, watching videos on youtube, carrying out banking, investing functions, listening to local radio channels and Pandora, downloading books and apps from Amazon, watching HD quality movies from Amazon, sending documents to kindle over an email. Without a doubt,  I am extremely happy and pleasantly surprised at its ease of use. The Fire boots remarkably fast, downloads web content at great speed, shows crystal clear images and videos. The screen rolls at a very fast pace showing the power of dual core processor, virtual keyboard is sensitive and fun to operate.The sound quality is acceptable and volume is loud enough for a noisy room. Streaming videos of movies and TV episodes works super fast and quality of the display is awesome.Now for the things I wish the Fire had -. I watch educational videos on you tube all the time. I really wanted  to download them to Fire, so I could watch them when I want and where I want, which according to my knowledge is not possible today. The Silk browser does not have any plug-ins that could perform this task. So you are back to downloading videos to your pc and then uploading them to Fire.Another missing feature is the absence of folder structure. The content is automatically classified and stored in different sections like video, audio, books, magazines etc, but you can't access those from any other section that the menu at the top. The folder structure like windows explorer doesn't exist in Fire today. This prevents you from organizing your content in your own way.Now for the quirks I found a little bit annoying. When you are watching youtube video in full screen mode and want to adjust volume, the only way you could make the volume adjustment bar to appear is to tilt Fire at an angle (sometimes but not always clicking the small arrow at the bottom displays settings. Why only sometimes is something I need to figure out). When Kindle senses that it needs to go to a portrait mode from a landscape mode or vice versa, it displays the settings at that time. Once you adjust the volume, the video restarts from the beginning and not from where you left it before adjusting the volume. I am sure, there must be some work around, but I haven't found that yet.Another important feature I think is important to mention is uploading of documents to Kindle. It could be done in two ways. One by connecting your other device like PC that hosts the document or by sending the document as an attachment to an email to your kindle email address. This email address is automatically assigned to you when you register the Fire. Getting the doc uploaded through this email address is something you need to get used to.As for the kindle applications. Although Kindle's ecosystem is still limited, it is expected to grow very fast. So far I could find all applications that I wanted like Facebook, Pandora, Radio streaming, Weather and most importantly Angry Birds - yeh!", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire  Review", "Author": "E.

It is truely fantastic and I would recommend it to anyone! That said, we both have android phones and love them. We are not anti-apple, we simply prefer android. When we read about the kindle fire coming out we were both very excited as we are also, like most, amazon fans. The idea of an e-reader/tablet that accesses Amazon's eco system sounds really great plus it runs on Android operating system. So this Christmas we got a Kindle fire and a Motorola xoom. If you're a prime member and/or you only want a tablet to access amazon content plus an e-mail or two and maybe surf the web a little, then you will like the fire. Here's my thoughts as far as comparing the fire to any android tablet. It doesn't compare. The kindle fire is an e-reader with some tablet features, offering more convienence, that's all. It is a great device and it runs very smooth, however, if you're looking for a full featured tablet, keep saving your money and don't buy the fire. The kindle fire does not access the andoid market so if you purchased an app on you phone, you have to pay for it again in the kindle market. The motorola xoom we got went to the android market and showed the purchases i made from my phone and allowed me to download them to my xoom tablet without extra charge. Though the fire runs android OS, Amazon's user interface is very smooth but totally different and will take a little getting use to. The bottom line is...the kindle fire is another great amazon product and has a very intensional use.

Priest", "ReviewID": "R289130X3XIN38", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The news is full of gibberish comparing the Kindle Fire to the Apple iPad.  Why?  These products are not designed to compete other than the fact that they are both essentially tablets.  Amazon and Apple are targeting two different markets, and I believe that was Amazon's intent from the beginning.  Every time a new tablet device is introduced it seems like the world has to compare it to the iPad whether it's designed as a competitive product or not, and that doesn't make sense.  I own and use an iPad2 daily for business and personal purposes; the iPad has replaced the notebook computer I used to lug about in meetings, when traveling, etc.  It's an excellent tool that I keep at hand all the time.  It will perform most all of the same functions as the Kindle Fire as well as the functions I need for business purposes.I purchased the Fire as a media device for use at home:  my household uses it daily to read books, to listen to music, to watch video and to play games.  It replaced an iPod Touch, actually.  It's a very convenient way to browse the web, check email and so on.  We use the internet heavily, and the Fire is an excellent portable household portal for our needs.  The Fire compliments the iPad in my home by making these services available on an additional device, or becomes the primary portable device when I'm away from home with my iPad.If I was pressed to find fault with the device, I would have to say that the power button on the bottom of the tablet is sometimes a bit difficult to find.  Since ours is in a leather case, we don't have any issue with inadvertently turning it off like some have reported. I would also like a some more flexibility in organizing the apps/books/media on the main screen.  For the initial release of a brand new product, I'd say it's pretty rock-solid compared to the other technologies I've reviewed in the past.  I understand an update will be coming out within the next 2 weeks, and though I don't know what that will contain just yet, it does speak to Amazon's commitment to the product.Some have complained about the ease with which apps and books are purchased using Amazon's store, making it possible for children to make unsupervised purchases.  Personally, I have no problems with this and appreciate it... this device is a physical extension of Amazon's massive media marketplace and users know that before they purchase the Fire.  Entering a complex password each time I make a purchase can be difficult, particularly when you're in a hurry or on the move.  Only adults use the device in my household, and if children do get access, they do so only when they are supervised.  Would I buy the Fire for a child to use?  No, or not likely. In my opinion this is not a child's toy and parents who purchase them for their children should understand these and accept these risks up front.  If Amazon were to implement a series of parental controls and other \"child safety\" features in order to appease this minority I would hope they would do so with a master control to either enable or disable the feature, as it seems unjust to punish the majority for the errors in judgement of the minority.I would definitely recommend the Fire as an excellent alternative to other Reader devices.  This device has a wealth of features that make it a wonderful personal media device.  The strength of Amazon and the wealth of media they offer makes the device makes it a winner.  Buyers who are looking at this device as a desktop/notebook replacement should rethink their strategy and look at other devices that are more appropriate.

Herein I think lies the problem for most critics. It does everything I want/need it to do and more. Some of the negative comments are just plain petty. Fingers too fat? How is that the Fire's fault? Problem easily solved: by a cheap stylus. For those of you expecting it to do everything an iPad does: be my guest and go out and spend $500+ dollars on an iPad. For watching movies, surfing the net, shopping, reading--I really like it. I have a regular Kindle and LOVE it. I would say the reading experience is different, not necessarily worse. One advantage is that the Fire is backlit, which the regular Fire is not. Sure, there is the glare, but an anti-glare screen can fix that. You say, well gee: you already have me buying two things! This is getting expensive. I bought a stylus, anti glare film, and a case and spent $30 total. The only minor critique I have is the apps. BUT, I also realize it is a new product and more apps will appear as the demand increases, which I believe it will.

It does not do some things more expensive tablets do (like that one from the fruit people) but my guess is that it will do what 90% of you want it to do. If you understand that and what you want is a less expensive portable entertainment device the Fire is a very good choice.First of all, I was already committed to the Amazon system with a Kindle and Amazon MP3 so having a tablet tied to those only made sense. Unsurprisingly the Fire works very well with that cloud system. The sound is ok through the speakers and I bought an inexpensive set of headphones (Sony over ear) and they work very well. Amazon prime gives you  excellent access to movies and TV and for me the size of the tablet works well for viewing. It is not like I am viewing them from 10 feet away. I hold the Fire on my lap and the picture is good to very good. If I want HD, any tablet is insufficient so the screen size is not a big deal for me. I like being able to carry the Fire in a pocket.So far the internet experience is good. The browser feels plenty fast and pretty responsive. Again, this is a smaller tablet so some sites do not fit as well as others, but I mostly read so that is not a big deal. For Twitter, email Facebook etc it works well. If you are used to doing that stuff on your phone, you can do it better on the Fire.  There is some occasional delay in the touch screen that hopefully will be remedied in later updates. The controls are intuitive and easy to understand. So far the memory seems more than sufficient, although this is clearly a device meant to rely on the cloud for most of the storage. Given that WiFi is becoming ubiquitous that should not be a big issue.The apps are limited in the sense that they do not have all of the millions of apps available for Android but there are many many apps available and again probably 90-95% of what you actually want or need. This is really not a business device and I cannot imagine using it for much word processing or spreadsheet. It is ok but not great for email. My guess is that the app selection will improve but most of you will not miss what is not there. It certainly works well for Angry birds and be aware that if you have kids you will be constantly debating whose turn it is to use it.As an ereader this is very good. The selection of books is of course excellent and the screen is easy to read. I honestly prefer my old kindle type style a bit for pure reading but the Fire is still quite good and very clear. I have plowed through about 2000 pages already with no complaints.I have played with other tablets and admittedly they can do a bit more than the Fire, but they do so at a higher cost and most of what they can do, I likely would not use much.  Again there are compromises at this price and screen size is one of them. Try to compare this side by side with other choices before you buy. This is vastly more portable than larger tablets and that mattered to me.As a relatively inexpensive entertainment device this is an excellent choice. Yes, by buying this now you kind of commit to the Amazon \"environment\" and if you want freedom there may be other tablets out there you will prefer but you will pay about double what this costs.

The Fire is living up to my expectations and is one of the best purchases I've made this year.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I had to purchase the Sprint mobile broadband card with 3G/4G which is $50/mo.  The positive to that is my company pays for my cell phone so I'm ok with paying for wireless service.Second, people should lower their expectations and stop comparing the Kindle Fire to the iPad.

Yes screen does freeze up every now and then and yes having fat fingers sometimes cause unit to be un-responsive. Having the case also might have something to do with freezing up for that second or two, because of the heat build-up. Even though i knew about the privacy issue with someone knowing what's on your unit i didn't think it would bother me...but it does. But not enough for me to not want this Fire. Plus as i watched the morning new today (12/13/11) i seen where Amazon is going to send out an update on these very issues within the next 2 wks. Way to go Amazon. So buying a new items which hasn't been tested on the open market is the rish that we make. So until Amazon send out updates i'm going to continue to enjoy my Fire. The cost of the unit, plus the willingness of Amazon to correct known issues makes me a very satisfied customer.

As for the power button, I put my fire in a case and have no problem with that at all.I have no regrets making this purchase, my husband actually wants one now too!

I have a Honda Accord that cost me about $22k.  Do you see me writing up reviews about how it just doesn't hold up to the $66,000 Mercedes SUV?Please.  What is wrong with people?If someone is such a little hipster that they can't hold any electronic appliance without comparing it to an Apple product that costs three times as much, perhaps they shouldn't dirty their little hands.  I just got through being told how I was a fool to buy my little toshiba laptop instead of a macbook.... only to find out that the guy had paid THREE TIMES AS MUCH for his mac book.  Sorry, but I can't afford to be that cool if the one that costs 75% less does the same job.Believe it or not, I actually HAVE and iPad.  (eeekkk!!)I like it, but it is just a bit too big for what I need.  I read a lot and I have an infant.  So, for me to rock a baby to sleep and read means I need a paperback, or something I can hold in on hand and turn the pages with my thumb.  -> Kindle.Can't do it with an iPad.  Sorry Mac fans, but i need my ipad to be smaller, there's no App for that.I also carry around a ton of junk wherever I go and my kindle actually fits in my back pocket.  (yep, it does).  I keep my books on it.  I read on the bus, on BART, at the Caffe, wheverver I have to wait.  Pulling it out of my back pocket is a one-handed maneuver.I used to use my phone to read on, but now I've got the Fire.Maybe a Nook would work too, probably, but I've used the nook and the Fire is a bit better.  I'd say that it is fare to compare the Nook to the Fire, but anyone comparing the Fire to an iPad is someone who's already biased towards the iPad.  No person with a actual clue about reality would compare the two unless they were making a point that the Fire could probably take care of 80% of what people actually do on their iPads.In fact, the only \"threat\" that the Fire ever held towards the iPad was that most iPad users actually would have been satisfied with a much more basic tablet, therefore the iPad absorbed many sales that it shouldn't have had in the first place, but gained only due to the fact that there was no product to cover that market sector.Now, just to get off the iPad irritation, I also want to point out that some people have kids.  I have 3.  They break stuff constantly.  They love to delete things.I've already had one iPad disaster, I'm not going to have another.  With that little kindle, I pop a movie in and hand it to my 5yr old and she can drive it with no problem.  My 3yr old has already tossed it down a flight of stairs -not a scratch.  She left it outside all day in the son - no problem.  I've sat on it a number of times (back pocket).  So far the thing is a rock.  And if it breaks, seriously, it isn't all that big a deal.  When that iPad got fried, all my pics that hadn't been sycned up were hosed.  I lost a ton of crap (yes, my own fault, but think about it.  I didn't have an option to leave them unsupervised, and now I do.)If you're going to get a table for $199, there is simply nothing on the market that is remotely close to this.  period.  nothing.It isn't perfect.  There's all sorts of crap that I'd like to change, but for $199, it rocks.There is nothing even close to the capabilities for that price.  nothing.  not even close.And, if you do have $600.... think about exactly what you \"need\" before you drop it all on an iPad.", "Date": "December 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Turn it 180 Degrees", "Author": "William Sutton", "ReviewID": "R1FW37ORDXE08H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you find the on/off button location annoying, just hold your Fire so it's on top.

The Kindle Fire was my answer to that.  I have had the device since it came out and have noticed a few negatives (thus the 4-star rating) such as the loss of catagorizing my books on the device which the Kindle 3 did well.  I was also assuming that the Kindle Fire, being an Android device, would allow any Android app to run on it, especially unhappy that I can not use my Google Calendar with it.  I am still hoping that Amazon will rectify this--please!!!  With that said, I still will not part with this new Kindle.  The touch screen is great and I do not miss the page turn buttons of the K3.  I did not expect the device to match what a $300-500 device can do but was pleasantly surprised by its abilities.  It's user friendly and Amazon has the BEST backup support of any company I have delt with and I did call them a few times with miscellaneous questions about the Kindle Fire.

I am already beginning to acquire an extensive library of apps, and I have over 300 books already on my Kindle account. I don't always know the name of the book or app I want to access, and I can't imagine trying to scroll through over 300 books to find a new mystery to read or through loads of apps to find a game to play! I hope that Amazon considers adding this feature in the near future.My second issue is that I'm finding many of the apps in the app store don't actually work on the Fire, maybe because they're designed for Android devices and are just not compatable with the Fire. I heard that Amazon is being very choosy about which apps they allow to be developed for the Fire. Let us decide!

It is really something all it's own. I have an iPhone which takes the bulk of my daily tech use, but I really liked the idea of being able to read on the bus. The books from the library, along with my purse, umbrella, lunch bag, phone, etc was just getting to be way to much. I don't buy books, don't see the point since the library is up the street, so I've looked for something to borrow digital copies and I already have Amazon Prime, Netflix and Hulu Plus for my Roku. So to have that all combined in one smaller (in relation) device is perfect for me. I can access the video streaming when working out, I've got the E-reader for the bus commute and a few other extras, apps and web browsing, that my daughter will love and leave my iPhone alone.This device is for the inbetweeners. I liked the look/display of the iPad/tablets but I don't see myself using half of the items available to me through any of those products, I was an early adopter of the netbook, so until I'm ready to make the leap to the next thing, I'll stick with that. Plus it's far to large for what I want. I also want something a little more then just an E-reader, some web browsing, streaming movies and TV ocassionaly, and the ablilty to look at magazines in color.Yes, the Amazon App Store isn't as complete as the full Android Marketplace.Yes it's not expandable, I believe they did this on purpose to get people to use the cloud, which I think is brilliant and I can't wait to test it out and play with it. This device is the perfect entry into that.Yes, the carousel is a little annoying in that is shows every single thing you touch, ugh wish I could simply delete the ones I don't want on it, but this is super minor.Yes, it's heavy in comparison to the E-readers out there, but again that's not what it is, so don't expect that.Yes, there isn't 3g connection, but if your phone has a hotspot or tethering you're golden.Yes, there isn't any access to the Overdrive app, but you've got the kindle books available through the public library directly and the amazon lending library.Yes, the speakers aren't the greatest, but that's why you've got headphones.Overall, if you're looking for a simple, easy to access device, that isn't going to break your budget, this is it. you'll get a little of everything. It was super easy to set-up and I haven't had that many hiccups. As with all new tech it'll take some getting used to.

A lot of that tends to go around some time (too bad there isn't an inoculation for it).The browser works well but I don't see any particular acceleration as billed by Amazon but I expect the Amazon acceleration servers were HEAVILY taxed yesterday.As for cloud drive, I am still playing with it and how it interacts with the 'Fire.  Seems to accept all the MP3's and MOBI's I put on it without problem.  I think there are caching and refreshing issues with regards to names (or possibly names are buried inside MP3) so renaming the cloud file doesn't always seem to change the filename on the 'Fire.Overall I am VERY PLEASED and now have two more on order..... added 11/27/2011Now at 4 and one more on order.

You can go on the web, download apps, games, books, documents, movies, videos, music.My initial reaction upon receiving it was the weight.  It's not heavy, but it was much more than I anticipated.  It weighed about a size of a medium paperback book to me.  I wasn't expecting that since the previous versions of the kindle have been extremely light and thin.  It's about 19cm x 12cm x 1cm; slightly smaller than a playbook.Once I turned it on it was like heaven!  The color, the features, is absolutely amazing.  The screen is shiny like the iPad so there is some glare; unlike the commercials for kindle, you cannot bring this one to the beach and read it under the sun.The kindle is set up with a main screen, which gives you your most recent apps/documents/books you were on.  Then there are sub screens for Newsstand, books, apps, video, music and the web. Each of these sub screens are set up differently.  There is also a search option, where you can search for anything in your kindle or the web.For Storage - You can either save it on your kindle or the cloud.  You are given 5GB free space and after that there is a charge.Books - It's set up just like the iBook application in the iPad.  You can choose to see it by Grid or List View and filter by Author, Most recent or Title.  It will tell you what % of the book you have already read and you can also bookmark pages.  It is identical to the iBook application except that you can change font sizes and types.Apps - It uses the Amazon App Store as its source so if you already have an android device it should be seamless.  It automatically pops up in your cloud.  If you already owned tablet compatible apps you can just download them onto your fire.Videos - If you have Amazon Prime, you can stream TV shows and movies.  You can also purchase movies and TV series to download on your kindle or stream.  (If you download, you can watch them when you are not connected to Wifi)You also have the option of downloading a Netflix app or a Hulu App if you don't want to purchase Amazon Prime.Music - You can either transfer MP3 files directly into your kindle or upload to the cloud.  In order to upload to the cloud, you need to download the Cloud MP3 uploader. It manages the Music by Artist, Song, Genre.Web - Accessing the internet on the kindle fire was always a question mark, since we didn't know what we were expecting.  It looks like its using a Google chrome like program, where it has tabs and remembers the recent sites you've been on.  You can add bookmarks and manage your pages.  The speed was fast.  I was able to go on facebook and go on a few websites at the same time and was fast as my computer would be.Transferring files - It's a breeze!  You can just connect your kindle to your computer via USB and just drag and drop.  I was able to transfer 400 books, 20 MP3's, and 15 pdf files within 15-20 minutes.  You can manage your files from your kindle or your computer.When you transfer files into your kindle by computer, you are transferring to your kindle and not the cloud.Pros:-It's a kindle!-Lending Library - you can borrow a book a month for free from their library.-Amazon App Store - if you have an android phone/tablet you can download onto your kindle automatically (if its compatible)-It's $199 for a tablet-Fast processor.  Can view websites and run apps like any other computer or tablet.-Easy to transfer from your computer.Cons:-Can't find a versatile cover (iPad and Prior Kindle's have covers which help with battery save/turn off when covered function)-WiFi Only.  Cant access the cloud all the time-Volume is not high enough to listen to music from afar.-No Camera so can't take pictures and upload. (Also have not found a screen capture ability built in)Overall the speed of the maneuvering within the kindle is very fast and easy.  It has all the features a tablet would have except it does not have a camera.  I think it's under valued for what it does for you.  I definitely think it will be a big competitor in the tablet market because of what it can do for the price ticket of $199.", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Digging it a LOT so far", "Author": "Robert Montanez", "ReviewID": "R2SUBCWGI9IIIK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Get one, it's a no-brainer. I'll tell you why I bought one:  I own an iPad but find it is too heavy to read books on for extended periods, so I decided to get a dedicated e-reader. This is not my first Kindle,  I used to own a second-generation Kindle, and loved it before I sold it on e-Bay to buy the iPad. Another reason is I long ago bought into the Amazon ecosystem. I've been an Amazon Prime user and Kindle book reader (using their apps) for about 4-5 years. If you buy their books, movies, music, apps, etc., then for $199 the Fire is an attractive choice.Can it do all the things larger tablets with more features like the iPad can do (it has no camera, microphone, GPS)? No, but that's what my older iPad is for, I got the Fire to be my e-reader and consumer of content. Is it limited by a lack of apps in Amazon's App store and the locked down, skinned version of Android ? Yes, but all the major apps you will likely use are there (e-mail, browser, Netflix, Hulu+, Pandora, Comixology, Pulse RSS reader, etc.) and you know somebody is going to root/hack this thing, which will make it even more useful for those that are into those things.A few quirky design things I don't like:- the power button is in a dumb place and there is no physical volume button (can adjust sound only via software),- the speakers are small, tinny, and also in a stupid place (when watching a movie and placing the Fire in horizontal mode, the speakers are positioned on the left, which obviates all stereo separation).- The top carousel interface is stupid and lists everything! Every app you run, book you read, music album you listen to and web site you browse which gives you no privacy and is overly sensitive to scrolling making it hard to choose anything (it's an obvious bad interface design that will need to be fixed with a software update).Overall I've had it for three days and I'm really digging it. Buying and downloading books, movies, music, apps is seamless and easier to do than on any other tablet or device (yes, even easier than the vaunted Apple app store) and it's all stored in the cloud (which means I can also get at most of my stuff via the use of apps or a web browser on my Mac, iPad, and iPhone). Amazon really has this one-click commerce/store stuff figured out and the device is at the right price point to be really disruptive to the marketplace. A LOT of stuff is included if you get the Amazon prime membership, too.

Still, I feel that things happen very responsively, just with a lower framerate.  But this still bugs some people that I've shown the Fire to. - Since the CPU and other hardware is slightly lower-end than other much-more-expensive tablets, you'll probably encounter a small number of games and apps that don't perform as well, but so far I haven't found any that I personally use.  It's still impressively fast for the price point. - There's only so much space on this thing (~6GB usable), so don't expect to load it up with tons of movies and large files before going on a long vacation with no internet.

The Fire came today - right on time, I might add - and met (even succeeded) all of my expectations. I, unlike other reviewers who may have been disappointed with the device, was expecting a great, advanced eReader - and that's exactly what I got.I look at it this way - I got my Kindle 3G for $189. It's a great eReader, but I was getting tired of always searching for a booklight, even if it was better for my eyes.

I'm giving it 4 stars (I would probably give it 4.5 if I could) because the first one we received probably had some 'bug' as it wouldn't connect to the internet.  It was easy to ship back and they replaced it immediately though.  We use the Fire for Netflix, internet browsing, books, games, and educational uses (flashcard apps etc.) I think some would want a camera like the Ipad does- but I'll be honest, the camera on the 'pad' is nothing great.

Anthony \"Bookworm\"", "ReviewID": "R3RG0IFM33NQZ2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My boyfriend got me the Kindle Fire for Christmas this past year.  I had always told him I didn't want a Kindle because I love having hard copies of all of my books - I love the smell of books, turning the pages, and basically everything that comes with \"real\" books.  (total book nerd).  With that being said, I'm IN LOVE with my Kindle Fire.  I can surf the web, update my Facebook page, play games, watch Netflix and do some awesome things on it.It did take me a month or so of having it before actually reading a book on the device, but I must say it's not as annoying as I thought it would be to read a book on an electronic device.  I can adjust the screen color so it's not a stark white background (I chose a slightly yellowed color) which makes the pages easier to read and puts less strain on my eyes.  My one complaint about reading books on the Kindle Fire is that the page numbers do not show up correctly so there's no way to tell how many pages you've read in a day (something that I always like to know when I'm engrossed in a book).  I really enjoy the fact that there are so many free books available to download to the Kindle Fire, especially since many of them are fairly current releases.  Having a Prime membership definitely enhances your Kindle Fire because you can rent a book a month from the kindle library and you can watch amazon instant streaming shows for free on your device.I will say the browser on the Kindle Fire is not exactly the best- every time I go to use the web or load my facebook app it sort of freezes my Kindle Fire for about a minute, then returns it to the home screen and I have to load the browser or facebook app again and even then it freezes for about another minute before asking if I'd like to load my previous tabs or not.  I'm not sure why this glitch continues to occur, but hopefully it will be fixed with future updates.All in all it's an incredible device for the price.

Basically, Amazon used Google's free platform, took everything about Google out of it (screwing Google), then turned around to monetize it solely for themselves. This isn't a culture that I like to support, and it is the biggest reason I will sell my Fire in the next 6 months.- Some 3rd party apps can be installed, but even to do this it is a pain. It takes time to search online to find the work-arounds to even get some common apps, like the Nook app to read B&N; purchases.- Doesn't come with a cord to connect to a computer. Quality cords start at about $10 [EDIT: see the comments for a quality cord that is about $5]. I've bought two lower-end cords and both will disconnect randomly.- *Both* speakers are on one end of the device, which makes watching video without headphones a one-sided audio experience (video is always in landscape mode)- The Fire is too thick/heavy to hold comfortably with one hand for a long period of time- Occasionally the screen and power button are glitchy. For instance, the device sometimes senses motion when there was none, and sometimes the device turns on immediately after I turn it offNeutral- The Fire should continue be viewed as an Amazon-integrated, not a regular tablet. It was engineered to tightly fit with Amazon content and not serve many other purposes. For example, it doesn't even come with a basic text editor, and the only free text editor I've found in the Amazon app store is buggy.In summary: the bad outweigh the good at this point. The tablet is now only on par with many other good tablets, and Amazon closes the user off from outside resources. Only because I've already got my Fire will I keep it for awhile longer... I'll sell it as soon as Apple brings out a smaller tablet or when Google comes out with their Nexus tablet.

I have read and reread the reviews for the Fire, and hesitated to spend the money to buy another reader.  Well, a few weeks ago, tax refund in hand, I purchased the Fire, and I have had my nose in it ever since.  People have said on the reviews that it is a reader, not an Ipad.  Well, I find that not to be entirely true.  I can read books, play games ad nauseum, check my email, surf the net, and send and receive documents.  I can correspond on FB and Twitter as well.  What's not to love?  It is as close to a mini laptop as you can get.  Will I eventually get an Ipad?  Maybe.  I have been extremely pleased with my Fire.  Well worth the money.  I take it everywhere.  Waiting at the doc's office?  Pull out your Kindle and the 2-hour wait flies.  The battery does not stay charged as long as the former Kindle does, but the Fire does so much more that it takes more out of the charge when in use.  Take your charger cord with you when you are on the go and plug in to an outlet at your bakery restaurant of choice, bagel and coffee in the one hand and Fire in the other.  I just love mine.  So so glad I finally clicked the purchase button and quit thinking about it.The only down side that I can find is that reading books on the Fire is not as friendly on the eyes.  Much easier to read on the older Kindle.  Other than that, I am in heaven.Oh, and purchase a stylus for your Fire.  Easier to hit the buttons.And the main selling point for me was that I can watch NetFlix on it.  No more dragging the laptop around the house to where I want to watch, or going to a certain tv to watch NetFlix.  Go anywhere with your KF, and as long as you can get internet access, you are watching shows/ movies in ten seconds.  Now, I am finally getting my money's worth out of my NF monthly charges.

This wins hands down! I wanted, first and foremost, a quality screen for reading and the ability to run few apps like eBay, Pandora etc.  I was not looking for an iPad or a straight out computer, since I already have a handy little netbook.  I wanted something to fit into my purse and a touchscreen; due to joint pain, keyboards are not always my friends :).I didn't want a device with a camera, gps etc.. I have my android phone and a nice digital camera.  I also didn't need to have an expansion slot for a micro sd card, since I intend to stay pretty loyal to Amazon content for my Kindle and I keep on top of what I have on my device. Books download so quickly, it is simple to remove old ones and add new ones.Reading on the Kindle fire is great.  I have read 3 books so far, and find that reading for a couple of hours at a time is not a strain for my 40+ year old eyes.The Kindle is also not very heavy if you hold it in your hand to read, but I recommend a case to make it easier.  I have my Kindle in a zip around roocase and that makes it very easy to stand up in front of me to read, email etc..As soon as I turned it on, I was in love with this device.  It detected my home wi-fi within seconds and I have had no trouble with it at all. Downloads are so swift, it's amazing. The Silk browser is everything it was described to be. I have watched a few streaming tv shows and it went perfectly.As for app selection, the Amazon app store is great.  I have installed a couple non Amazon apps, and that process was very easy.  I considered rooting the Kindle, but I don't want to give up all of the benefits of Amazon streaming etc.. I will stick to rooting my phone, and keeping the Kindle just as it is.The speakers are very nice, in my opinion.  My husband, who is the musician in the family, was impressed with the sound.  He watched several youtube videos and was pleasantly surprised.  His only comment was, \"needs more bass\", but he says that about every system :).I have sent several documents to my Kindle and they display perfectly.  I find more things to do with it every day. It's just a handy little gadget and very easy to use.If you are looking for a device that looks great, works great and is very intuitive, this is it.

I had planned to get one for Christmas but I was so concerned about some of the reviews I waited...I find now there was no need! Here are some of the issues I worried about for no reason.1) The Kindle Fire comes registered and in a Kindle Box so is a high theft item. I can believe why this would be the case however, you can order the Kindle to ship unregistered and in a plain amazon box. I did this, choose saver free shipping and had it in my hands in 4 days with no issues.2) Everything you have been doing recently is on the carousel and can not be removed...this is just not so. To remove an item from your carousel simple touch and hold and you are given the option to remove or add the item to favorites. This seemed like bad programing to me but I don't look at or read things I am concerned about being seen so was a minor issue for me it pointed to shortsighted design. I am happy to say there are no worries.3) Shopping is unsecured...also untrue. Simple go into account admin and set restrictions, this is nice for young people and you can limit internet access all together if needed.4)This one makes be laugh a bit. \"The power button and charging cord plug in at the bottom and this gets in the way.\" Ummmm....\"There is no spoon...\" The kindle screen shifts to orient down depending on how you hold it. So....why not just turn your kindle so the button is on top?5) Some others claimed the Kindle gets too hot, mine does not, or that the touch screen is not as nice or intuitive as an ipad.

Comparing the two is much like comparing apples (har) and oranges.  I say this because I've noticed that most iPad fans really like what makes the iPad stand out in the field of tablets.  That said, I was interested in an iPad but absolutely did NOT want to pay the premium price (Full Disclosure: I am an Apple fan and have a MacBook and an iPhone and love them both dearly).  What I did want was something similar, with similar functionality, perhaps smaller and at a much more affordable price.  In that regard, the Kindle Fire is exactly what the doctor ordered.It does not replace my iPhone, as I still use that when out of the house and other functionalities.  It does, however, make reading on a device SO much more attractive.  The reader function (my primary reason in wanting the Fire) is great; I love reading books on my Fire and the ease of acquiring new things to read is a VERY handy feature.  Reading blogs is also nicer on my Kindle for much the same reason.  I haven't watched a lot of movies on mine, but my husband has on his and he loves it for that.  I haven't played a lot of games either, but then I'm not a big gamer.  I did play a round or two of Angry Birds though and was impressed with how \"cushy\" the large screen felt during gameplay.I do wish there was a slot for an SD card or something, to improve upon the storage options.  However, there are things you can store in Amazon's cloud which means I haven't even come close to running out of room yet.  I also wish the Fire had come with a cable that allowed me to connect to my laptop.  I plan to go buy one as soon as the holidays are over but in the meantime, the lack of it grates on my nerves.I also feel the Fire needs a case or something.  The device itself is a good size and not overly heavy or anything.  But I do find myself wishing for something else to \"hold onto\".  I guess it's the vestiges of someone who is used to reading physical books.  Again, this is something I plan to purchase after the holidays.Battery life is definitely sufficient.  Seeing as how I use it mostly to read books, I only need to charge it about once a week or so.  I've been very pleased with the battery life, considering the features.Again, if you really want an iPad, you should just get an iPad.

I've been in the market for a tablet device for quite some time, but nothing really stuck out to me as what I really wanted. I have a nook color that I loaded up with stock android, which was great, but after a while I grew tired of the stock interface, it just really doesn't make sense for a tablet device. Then came along the Kindle fire. I really like what Amazon has done with it's custom interface, it works well for a tablet device, I have quick access to just about everything that I could possibly want to do with my tablet across the top of the launcher, if I want to read a book, boom there it is just tap on \"Books.\" I really like that depending on what section I am in, aka books, apps, I can quickly access the respective stores to purchase more content, and also I think it is a nice touch that I can quickly switch between content on my device and also be able to see what is stored in the cloud. For once I am using my device for consuming content, instead of being on a constant search of making my interface look different, I am getting in doing what I want and getting out.The Kindle Fire is not perfect though, it has some issues with lag, if you will, or lack of responsiveness, especially when in an app and trying to hit the back button, it seems all to often, it doesn't respond, and I find myself hitting the back button several times before it finally gives me the option to exit a game, not really a deal breaker, hopefully this can be addressed in a future software update. But, I will say that the Kindle fire handles games with out a hick-up.

I didn't buy the iPad because it was so far out of my price range, I had to put it on the 'perhaps someday' list.  Not so with the Fire, and truth be told I'm not usually an early adopter of technology.The Kindle Fire is a well designed entertainment tool.  But more than that, when you download apps it becomes valuable tool for all purposes.  For instance, I now have a balance tool, a money conversion tool, a kitchen timer, game console, and instant weather.  You can also download a virus application!  Some tools are free, and some for a small fee.  Not every application for android works on the Fire, just be aware of that.The only things I would improve are...  1:  Battery life as good as my Kindle Reader (2 weeks vs 8 hrs)  2:  WhisperNet for getting content no matter where you areThe pros are how fast content loads and installs, and how fast the screen responds to a light touch - but that is also a con because it's too easy to activate an unwanted page when scrolling pages in web mode, and then you have to arrow back to the screen that you were reading.  But when you go back to the previous page, it restores to the top of the page rather then where you were... very irritating.The cons are quickly outweighed by how I can read, watch streaming movies, answer emails and connect to a WiFi network quickly, all in the dark!You can do all the swipe, pinch, push, and expand motions on most all pages just like on an iPad or smart phone, and when reading a book you swipe to turn the page.  The screen contrast is good for reading, but I still prefer my v2 kindle best for that function because it has a longer battery life.  Reading outside, the Fire does have some screen glare, but as long as you are in a shady area it's not as bad as all that.

I think the help section leaves a lot to be desired. It leaves out basic information like how to remove something from the device.All in all I am very pleased with my Fire. And so is my hubby who swore he didn't see any reason for them 3 months ago!", "Date": "November 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "For $200, This Thing Is Brilliant", "Author": "Dana Sciandra", "ReviewID": "R3RVEWH3LNY2K4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wrote a comprehensive breakdown and first impressions of the Kindle Fire on my website when it was first announced back in September. Well, the day has finally come and mine has arrived!I am also planning to do a full video review and hands-on demo in the coming days, but just wanted to post a quick review now that my newest toy is finally in my hands.First impressions \"out-of-the-box\" is that it is a VERY solidly constructed device, that feels great in the hand and has a really nice weight to it. I have already begun to play around with:Streaming Video: Smooth, no stutters, very crisp and clear. I tested on Amazon Instant Video and Netflix. The display is quite beautiful, packing more pixels-per-square-inch than the iPad.Apps: Limited due to availability through the Amazon Appstore (and not the Google Market), however there are thousands of apps available that are optimized for the Fire...which is what Amazon wanted, in order to ensure the best customer experience (not dissimilar to what Apple does). I haven't had any trouble finding most of my favorites (i.e. Evernote, Pandora, Politico, Comixology, RSS Readers etc). I also side-loaded and installed the Spotify apk, since it is currently not available in Amazon's Appstore...yet.Music: I have been using and recommending Amazon's Cloud Player for a long time, therefore as soon as I turned on my Fire, I had access to the thousands of songs I already had stored in Amazon's cloud. All streaming perfectly and clearly, displaying the album art and other listening options. The ability to download your music directly onto the device is clearly displayed and a snap to do, but I doubt that I will do that, since I can simply stream all of my music and let Amazon do the storage heavy-lifting it for me.Books: Looks great and shopping for books is SO much nicer / easier than on the previous Kindle's monochromatic display, but when it comes to reading, nothing can beat my 2nd generation Kindle and E-Ink display...I'm just not a fan of back-lit displays when reading a book. Therefore I do not plan to read many books on the Fire unless I'm reading in bed as the girlfriend sleeps. :)The new Silk Browser: Disappointingly a little choppy in places, especially when using pinch-to-zoom or scrolling on pages with a lot of images; however according to Amazon, this will improve as more and more people are using the Silk Browser and it learns predictive surfing (in which Amazon cache's and pre-loads pages on their farm of servers). Basically, as more people use it, the faster it will get. It's not a bad experience by any means, just currently not as smooth as on my iPad, which I have become accustomed to. However, in the days since I have received my Fire, I have noticed the Silk Browser getting faster and faster when it comes to loading the pages of websites that I frequent often.During the next few days, I will be spending a lot of time with the device in order to take it through some trials, data-loads and \"real world\" usage before giving my final word; which will come shortly in a comprehensive video.I also stated in my original 'First Impressions' write-up that I did in September, that I do not plan to compare the Fire directly to the iPad, as they are entirely different devices, that appeal to different people. There are simply those (millions) who will never pay over $500 for a tablet, but who want to enter the tablet market...for those people, Amazon just became your new best friend.Frankly, you sound like an idiot if you think a $200 device can be compared to a $500 - $800 device. And for $200 - and judging from my initial time with it - the Kindle Fire is absolutely BRILLIANT when you compare that low price point against what it is capable of.", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire: Exactly What I Hoped", "Author": "Peter Hesse", "ReviewID": "RVC7ZQEJUQAGP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There have been a number of reviews of the Kindle Fire, many of them less than stellar. Too many of the reviews focus on how the Kindle Fire is not an iPad. It isn't trying to be. It's not a pure Android tablet either. While I don't love everything about it, it is exactly what I was hoping it would be--a personal entertainment and internet device that could almost fit in my pocket.There is a lot to say about the Kindle Fire, but if I wanted to sum it up, I would simply say this: It is worth the price as an entertainment and internet device. Unsurprisingly, it provides the best experience when you're using Amazon's media services including MP3/cloud player, Instant Video, Appstore for Android, and Kindle. It is almost a no brainer for someone that is an Amazon Prime member.Read on, then, for my initial reactions to the Kindle Fire:I will note up front that I was an early adopter of the Kindle; when my Kindle Fire arrived it was named \"Peter's 5th Kindle\" if that gives you any clue. And the Kindle Fire is not a Kindle. It shares the name alone. No LCD screen, no matter what the contrast or resolution, will ever compare to an e-Ink screen in terms of readability for extended periods of time. The Kindle Fire can download my books, and I can read them (and just might, for short stretches) - but I will always prefer the e-Ink Kindle for reading._Hardware_At just a little smaller (in dimensions) but thicker and heavier than my second-generation e-Ink Kindle, it fits in my hand nicely. The simple design will likely not win any awards, but the rubberized back feels good in the hand. The heft of the device is just right; it feels solid, without needing to be propped up or held with two hands like an iPad. My main issue with the hardware is the decision to put two speakers on the same side of the device (top in portrait mode, left in landscape). So when you're watching a movie, all the sound is coming out of the left side. In other words, you really want headphones. The battery life is as advertised, lasting more than a day in standby, or 7-8 hours of heavy use without needing a charge._Display_With a display of 1024x600, it has the same number of pixels as my 10-inch netbook in a smaller space. The resolution is not quite as good as the iPhone 4's retina display, but it is better than most other tablet devices I've seen including the iPad. You end up with very readable text and very sharp images on a smaller screen. Brightness is easily adjusted so you can trade readability for battery life and the flick of a finger._Interface_Amazon has skinned this device with a launcher that is very Amazon focused. You can see the main home screen in the picture; There's a search field, a menu across the top to get to the main uses of the device, and then a bookshelf motif. The top shelf has the list of most recent applications which were used; below that are your shelves for favorites. The coverflow-style scrolling is smooth and the performance is generally OK. It does lag a bit when you rotate from portrait to landscape, or switch pages (from Books to Apps to Music for example). Overall, though, the interface is very useful, and hides much of the \"Android\" from this Android-based device._Books_As I stated above; the Kindle Fire screen doesn't compare to an e-Ink screen, but it's a completely usable interface to Kindle books. The best kinds of books on this device are interactive children's books, often made available as apps. (See the Dr. Seuss book apps such as [...] for example.) Oh, and if you are an Amazon Prime member, you get to borrow one book for free every month from the Kindle Owner's Lending Libary - a nice perk including over 100 New York Times Best Sellers._Magazines_Yes, the screen is a little small for full magazines. However, the display resolution is just about good enough, and a little pinching here and there makes anything readable. And you can always display the magazine in text-only e-Ink Kindle style, to improve the readability at a sacrifice of layout. I didn't check out newspapers, because, well, I have internet access._Apps_Perhaps the greatest current shortfall of this device is the application selection. While many common apps are available in the Amazon Appstore for Android, not all are - most obviously, any of Google's applications including GMail, YouTube, and the Android Market. It is possible to \"sideload\" many other Android applications which are not available through Amazon's marketplace, but that involves steps probably too complicated for {insert non-techie person here}. If the apps you run are in the Amazon Appstore, all will be well, but if not, you may end up with some disappointment. For example, neither the official Twitter application or Tweetdeck are available through the Amazon Appstore for the Kindle Fire._Web Browsing_The Amazon Silk Web Browser is fine. I can't say it seems amazingly faster than any other web browser, but I have pretty fast internet connectivity at home and at work. This is likely an extensive beta test for Silk being available on other platforms, especially ones with cellular connections rather than wifi. Given the privacy tradeoffs, I'd prefer the ability to default to a different browser which currently isn't supported. For now, I've unchecked the \"Accelerate Web Browsing\" button and I'm hoping for the best._Music_Since the Amazon MP3 store became available, I've been using it as an alternative to iTunes because it provided DRM-free copies of music. Once the Amazon Cloud Player service became available, to store my MP3s and stream them to my Android phone, I've had my music collection uploaded to Amazon's cloud. Put simply, this device makes it simple to access all that music. Your 8GB of local storage becomes essentially unlimited for music if you use Amazon's cloud storage._Video_Amazon Prime Membership includes access to something like 10,000 free streaming videos, which is nice. The Amazon Appstore also has a brand-new Kindle Fire-optimized Netflix app, for those that are Netflix subscribers. Both of those work great for streaming video. Renting and purchasing videos from Amazon's video store is super-easy and makes Amazon's entire library of over 100,000 video options available to you. Rented and purchased videos can be downloaded to the device for offline viewing, unlike Netflix and Amazon Prime Streaming videos. Uploading your own videos to the Kindle Fire via USB is also an option, but not as easy. Uploaded videos appear in the Gallery app (not the Videos tab) and basically only the H.263 and H.264 formats are supported._Email_The device comes with a built-in email application. The email application is fairly functional, but very bare bones. I believe there are some bugs in the email application currently (for example, I can't get it to stop checking my email), but those will likely be resolved over time._Keyboard_As a touchscreen only device, it has a software keyboard that appears when it is needed. It's a pretty good keyboard interface, and combined with the fact that device fits well in my hands, typing with two thumbs seems easier to me than it does on an iPod Touch or iPhone. The keyboard does a pretty good job with auto-correction and auto-suggestion, but undoubtedly some Kindle Fire screenshots will appear on [...] before long.-------------------SummaryWow, so that was a lot more than I expected to write about a device I've owned for a little over 24 hours. In summary, at $200 it is a good value for the price, especially if you are (or are considering becoming) an Amazon Prime member. The next version of the Kindle Fire will likely be more powerful, more flexible, and more capable - but for this year I still think it's a decent investment.Who should buy it:- People could use a device which is smaller than a laptop but larger than a phone for web browsing, using basic Android apps, checking email, and consuming media like books, music, magazines, and video.- People who are invested in the Amazon ecosystem of services (including Amazon Prime, Kindle, MP3/Cloud Player, Instant Video, and Appstore).- People who have wireless (wifi) internet access everywhere they plan to use the device.Who should not buy it:- People who want a tablet which is basically functional enough to replace a computer.- People who want a device with a camera, microphone, bluetooth, GPS, or cellular network access.- People who do not have wireless (wifi) internet access everywhere they plan to use the device.- People who are Apple fanboys. :)", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Perfect tablet for *PRACTICAL* usage!", "Author": "GoldenTiger", "ReviewID": "RD9TRPMW07AIY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just received my two ordered Kindle Fire tablets, and am quite pleased.PROS:-UI is very snappy and responsive-Size is perfect for one-handed portrait reading or two-handed landscape web browsing and typing.-Screen is extremely high quality thanks to the IPS display, with flawless viewing angles and excellent color.-Setup was dead simple: enter router/wifi settings, automatic update of software done by the Fire, then enter Amazon password and you're off!-The software integrates your content as well as Amazon's in a great, pleasant-to-use fashion.-Weight is very light.-Web browser has tabs, making browsing multiple pages with some the background easy!-Software is rock-solid stable... no crashes, errors, or glitches in around 7-8 straight hours of use today while setting it up and exploring what it has to offer.-There is already a root mod available on XDA.-1024x600 resolution has better DPI (dots per inch) than the iPad, and looks fantastic on a 7\" screen.-Battery life is strong... 20% left after fully charging and having used it for about 7 and a half hours nearly straight once fully charged with mixed web browsing, gaming, and video watching through Prime streaming.CONS:-The rubberized backing is very slippery at first, but after using it for several hours now it seems to be becoming more \"grippy\" and not sliding from my hands. I have a case on order which hopefully will alleviate any remaining issues at that point.-Screen size is a scrap small at times for web browsing, though in general I prefer it to my 10\" Asus Transformer for most tasks.-\"Frustration-free\" packaging requires you to tear it to open... very strange!-Audio quality from built-in speakers lacks bass; however, this is expected for a tablet, and overall the quality is better than I expected.------------Overall, I'm very impressed. I was keeping my expectations relatively low due to the somewhat mediocre previews, but I am encountering none of the quibbles they had with it. Perhaps the day-1 software update I mentioned above is partly to thank for that, but the shipping units are great.To touch on the storage \"issue\" people keep bringing up... in all practicality, it's not an issue at all. Considering a video encoded for these sizes of screens is about 800mb to 1gb and is 1hr 45m to two hours long, even if you're taking a round-the-world plane ride you can fit 4-5 movies, hundreds of songs, and hundreds of books all on local storage. If your plane were to have wifi access you could browse the web as well. Barring that rare circumstance, for virtually everyone else it is plenty to be able to carry that amount of content with you and access the web through your cell phone.I really can't stress enough how well Amazon's team pulled this off: the Kindle Fire user interface is extremely intuitive and well-designed. I am a programmer by trade and build my own PC's, and find it fine. A relative of mine who is a computer neophyte found it fairly easy to use, with little guidance needed from me as she played around with her Fire.The bottom line is, this thing does and performs 90-95% of what any other tablet could. Price aside, even though it's extremely inexpensive for a tablet at $200, it is a fantastic product. Sure, it lacks rarely-used features such as a \"front-facing camera\" for video chat, and can't hold fifty hours of video, but... truth be told, do you really need to be able to video chat off of your tablet? Do you really need to have multiple, non-stop days worth of content on your tablet to watch at one time? Considering the streaming video and the overall capability to store a few movies plus hundreds of songs plus hundreds of books plus your apps/games, I'm really having trouble thinking of a scenario you could \"run out\" of content other than being stranded on a desert island for a month. The Kindle Fire does everything virtually all users, with few exceptions, could want or need, and at a fraction of the price. Heck, with the current price point you could buy this tablet/reader PLUS an Asus Transformer on sale or other similar 10\" tablet, all for around the same pricing as the base iPad 2 model ($499 + tax/shipping, Apple stuff rarely goes on sale).RATING: 5/5", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Perfect for a person who has never had a tablet!", "Author": "Katie", "ReviewID": "R2J32JJRL48ADP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm horrible at reviewing things but I'm going to give my first impression of the Kindle Fire. I find the home screen very user friendly and bright and colorful. Streaming video has done pretty well the only reason I can't say great is because our internet has been spotty here the past few days. Graphics are super clean. Web browser is pretty quick in comparison to my iPhone. Facebook mobile app is very similar to what I'm used to. One thing I thought was strange was viewing videos on facebook. You have to download the video before it will let you watch instead of stream. In some ways that is nice because the video is flawless, but it concerns me about getting tripped up with these virus videos. I haven't really tried to read on it yet because I'm too busy playing with the apps and news sites. There are plenty of decent Fire approved Android apps, many free or inexpensive. I found one news app that has all the newspaper websites from all over the country and I love that one! Just like any tablet/smartphone the keyboard can be tricky but the predictive text format is helpful and will take some getting used to. It's much better than the iphone predicted text because it will give you suggestions instead of just pick some crazy word. Battery life seems to be that similar to my iPhone so it will not last a whole day if you are playing on/reading it constantly. Buying content is easy and quick using the one-click payment method. Apps, books, video, are instantly sent to the device. I know some people are tempted to take data/files outside of the amazon realm but it seems like more trouble than it's worth. I'm a avid Amazon user and have had a Kindle 2 for the past 2 years so I already have an extensive digital library of free classics and other books I haven't gotten around to read.

I am an avid Apple user and purchase a lot of content from the Apple iTunes Store as well as a lot of content from Amazon and their cloud services.  As such I feel that I can speak on a great deal when comparing the two content ecosystems, which is really what you are buying into when you get an iPhone/iPad or a Kindle Fire.For starters the Kindle Fire is a very clean looking device.  If you had ever used a Blackberry PlayBook (and why would you have as that was a terrible product) then you will have a great sense as to how the Kindle Fire looks.  However, that is where the similarities stop.  The software driving the Fire is really the killer app.Pros:Amazon content at your fingertips:  This cannot be understated...Amazon's Kindle Fire allows you to consume Amazon content with an ease not seen prior.  Not even Apple's online store and suite of devices can compare to the ease of use and content delivery/acquisition that the Fire brings to the table.  Everything from navigating around the various book, music, video and app stores to uploading your content to Amazon's cloud music player is remarkably simple and organic feeling. When I use my Fire I feel like I have all of my Amazon content right in front of me.\"Android\" software: The kernel might be Android but this is basically the Amazon OS.  While quirky in some areas the OS is very polished and items like the favorites board and the carousel work fantastic.  For the most part the unit is very responsive; however, it certainly could have benefitted from 1GB of RAM as opposed to the chosen 512MB.Form Factor: I owned the iPad 1 and currently own an iPad 2 and for what I want to do (i.e. read books, watch the occasional videos and browse the web) I have to say that the 7\" screen is an ideal size for portability and comfort.  Is web browsing a bit awkward?  Yeah, but the tradeoff is well worth being able to easily hold the unit in one hand and read without feeling like my arm was going to fall off after 10 minutes of use.Cons:Sluggish (sometimes) Performance: Given that the Fire has a dual core processor there really should be no lag when turning pages in a book or moving from each screen, but occasionally there is.  I feel that this is more of a software optimization problem as opposed to a hardware issue and am looking forward to seeing Amazon evolve their OS.Storage: This is the single greatest weakness of the Kindle Fire.  It only has 6.54 GB of usable storage space.  Granted, Amazon allows access to an infinite amount of content from the cloud but given that I have easily a 200GB video library on Amazon Video On Demand and a 65GB music collection stored in Amazon's Cloud Music player I would love the ability to have more local access to my content when out of Wi-Fi range or when I am traveling.  I am sure this will grow with future iterations of the Kindle Fire but really, 6.54GB of usable space is not enough, even for a casual user (and I am not a casual user).Weight: This is more of a gripe than a real detriment but for a 7\" tablet the weight is a little more than what I expected.  It is not heavy, as I mentioned in the Pros that it is certainly light enough not to cause strain when handling with one arm, but I would like to see Amazon put the Kindle Fire on a slight diet for the inevitable second generation machine.Overall: When you take into account all that the Kindle Fire does at the low price of $199 then this should be a no brainer so long as you are willing to use Amazon's services and utilize their cloud storage.  Even Apple fans will find a home for the Kindle Fire and Android fans...there has not been a better \"Android\" tablet yet.

I'd been thinking of getting a tablet, so when the fire was announced I was one of the first in line to pre-order.  The price was right for my budget and I already knew that I loved my older kindle - perfect!  I received my fire yesterday and I'm quite pleased.  It was a bit heavier than I anticipated it being, but after using it for a few hours last night this ended up not bothering me like I thought it would.  If you've ever played with a Droid tablet of any sort then you'll already be pretty familiar with most of the functionality.  I found it quite intuitive.  The screen is bright and the touch screen is responsive and easy to use.  I've had no trouble with the keyboard.  Downloading my music from the Cloud was seamless and easy.  Watching videos is fast, easy, and the picture quality is great.  The web seems very fast.  Ok, so it doesn't have a camera, but I own a digital camera and a phone that has a camera.  I wasn't planning on running around taking pictures with my kindle so this doesn't bother me at all, even though I know this would probably be a deal breaker for some users.  The lack of a SD slot doesn't bother me either.  To me, putting things on the Cloud via my computer in my free 5GB of space and then pulling them onto my device that way is just as easy (or easier) than other transfer methods.Text-to-speech seems to have been omitted from the fire, and that kind of disappoints me because I occasionally like to turn that on and have it read to me when my eyes get tired, etc.  It isn't the end of the world for me that it isn't available on the fire, but I mention it in case this is a deal breaker for anyone out there reading this.  That said, I've still got my old kindle so if I want that feature I'll just pull out the 2nd generation, sync it up, and bypass the fire's shortcoming.  I imagine I'll probably still use the 2nd generation for outside reading situations as well, but I haven't tested the fire outside yet so I cannot say for sure.Overall this is exactly what I wanted.

Amazon clearly states, that the Kindle Fire is Wi-Fi only. For those that are complaining about their purchase because the Kindle Fire does not have 3g or 4g access, the only one to blame in that regard, is the person who made the purchase, without understanding what was being purchased.As to weight, the Kindle Fire weighs less than a pound. I don't understand the ire many seem to have about the Kindle Fire being too heavy.I received my Kindle Fire on November 15th. I immediately connected to Wi-Fi at work, and the Kindle Fire proceeded to download the update on the original charge without any problems. After installing the update, I fully charged the Kindle Fire before testing it out.The screen - It is nice. I haven't had an issue with glare, as some others have. I have not spotted any screen bleeding, or any other abnormalities with the screen.The touch screen - It is not consistent, in regards to launching an app or using the device. Many times, I have had to touch the screen more than once (sometimes 2 and 3 times), to get the Kindle Fire to respond. While the aforementioned doesn't occur every time, it happens enough to be more than noticeable. I don't know if it is a software or hardware issue. If I had to put a percentage on the ongoing occurrence, it would be approximately 20 - 25%.Wi-fi - I haven't had any problems with the Kindle Fire not connecting (or staying connected) to my home or work network. I haven't experienced any(movie)buffering issues at home, but I have experienced some at work, while on lunch.Battery - Thus far, my mixed use battery life has been consistent. It has been anywhere from 6.5 hrs to 7.25 hrs. Charging time has been less than 4hrs, when charging from 15% or just under.Storage - Available use is just over 6gigs out of the box. I don't see a need to load my Kindle Fire down with a lot of my personal music files, as I make use of Pandora. I also don't purchase movies to watch on the Kindle Fire. If I do purchase a movie, I get the physical movie to watch on my plasma t.v. As such, the lack of a 16gb+ Kindle Fire device is not an issue for me.Reading - Eye strain hasn't been an issue thus far. While I still use my Kindle 3g for reading, I do find myself going to the Kindle Fire more and more.  Font display has been crisp and consistent. The lack of text to speech feature is not an issue for me, given the archaic manner of the Kindle 3g. If the Kindle Fire had the feature available and it had the voice quality of Siri, I could see myself making use of it. At this point in time, the feature or lack thereof, is merely a preference.Internet - While Silk is not blazing fast, I have noticed that it has gotten faster and faster, as it learns more about my preferred usage habits. Sometimes, pages load almost instantly, and at other times, it takes 2 - 3 seconds. In the grand scheme of things, 2 -3 seconds is not a big deal, at least for me. If a few seconds extra loading time is what some reviewers call \"sluggish,\" then maybe their expectations are too perfect for imperfect world me. If the issue is more than a few seconds loading time, I haven't experienced what others have.Sound - Listening to music via Pandora has been more than adequate. I haven't had a need to readjust the volume to a higher level. With movies, I have found the sound quality and volume to be much less at the same level. Even with the volume turned up, it has been hard to hear many times. If I connect my Bose headphones, the sound quality and level is fine. In fact, I have had to turn the level down a few times. In my opinion, one should not have to rely on headphones, in order to make proper use of movie viewing. If you are looking to be \"blown away\" by the sound of the Kindle Fire, you are going to be disappointed.Keyboard - It is very responsive. I haven't had any problems with it, save my getting used to the layout, versus being use to my IPHONE.Carousel - While I don't mind the look and intent of the carousel feature, I would like to see a software update from Amazon, that gave the user the ability to turn off the feature, or the ability to categorize book, movie, and document sections of the Kindle Fire.App selection - I would like to see more app availability. Hopefully, it will increase. I haven't loaded many apps on my Kindle Fire. The ones I have loaded, have worked without any problems.Overall, I am happy with my purchase. While the Kindle Fire does have some \"bugs\" to work out, I think it has made a solid opening debut.

After several years of wrestling trying to install non-standard apps like Weight Watchers Mobile and others, I have finally purchased a REAL ANDROID - Samsung Tab3 8.0\".  See my review on this device, and it will all become crystal clear!http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/?ie=UTF8&ref;_=ya_your_reviews&sort;_by=MostRecentReviewI received my Kindle Fire exactly ONE day after the product release.  Very impressive.  Within the first 24 hours, I discovered that there was a problem with the power switch (the only moving part on the whole device.) For some unknown reason, the device sometimes would not go on, - totally unpredictable failure.  I went through all of the hoops of reset, shut down, reset ... but I could not duplicate the problem.  It was as if it had a mind of its own. I figured that I must have been doing something wrong ... but it really seems as though the design was idiot proof ... therefore I should be safe.Well, after a day or so, on Thursday, 11/17/2011, I sent an email to tech support.  Within hours I received a reply suggesting I call them at my convenience because they thought they might have to replace the unit.  On Friday, 11/18/2011, I called Amazon tech support.  I waited all of two minutes to speak to a rep.  After explaining my difficulty she told me that she was shipping a new Kindle Fire immediately.  I would have 30 days to return the old one.  She sent me a link to the shipping label, which I printed.  Today, 1 day later, I received the new device via FEDEX Saturday Delivery.  I synched my device to the cloud to save my bookmarks, and de-registered the device.  The new device appears to work perfectly.What can I say?  There will always be hardware issues now and then, and I was just unlucky enough to get the odd device that was faulty.  However, AMAZON SERVICE IS AMAZing!  How can you fault a company that responds this way.As for the device itself, I am totally enamored with it. Sure, it doesn't have a camera like the iPad, but it was a conscious decision on my part that that was not a deal-killer.  I just don't need that.  It doesn't have the memory of the iPad, but it is supported by the \"cloud\" if you should need memory. Accessing your books from the cloud is seamless - a slight downloading delay and that's it. 3G/4G cellular might have been nice, but there are enough WI-FI hot spots that I don't envision this being an issue.The screen on the KF is crisp, clear and vivid.  It is glossy, so I don't know what it is going to be like reading in sunlight.  I don't think that will be an issue.  The font and background of books is the same as the monochrome Kindle, and is very easy on the eyes.  Whatever Amazon did on the original Kindles has been preserved in the KF.Navigation through menus and screens will take a little while to get used to, but it seems to be intuitive enough.If I were to highlight any issue, it would be touch typing on the virtual keyboard.  I think my fingertips are just too big.  I'm getting used to it, but I have to watch to be sure I am not hitting adjacent keys.  There are a few special characters that I would include on the alpha layer of the keyboard since they are used fairly often.  The period (.) and comma (,) are the only ones there.  I would also include the slash (/), \"at\" sign (@), and the colon (:), since these are often used in URLs.  Thoughtfully though, if you are transitioning between different KB layers, another line appears on top of the KB with a variety of special characters.There is an auto-correction option that you can select for common typo and mispellings, but I must warn you that it is very INSISTENT.  I was typing one word and it kept forcing its interpretation (another word) on me.  I either would have had to return to the options and turn off the auto-correct function, or just find another word to say what I wished.  Most auto-correct functions allow you to backspace over the correction and your subsequent entry will be accepted.  I think there may be updates in the future, and things like this are easily correctable.I guess I could go on and on.  The bottom line is that if I were faced with the decision to buy a tablet today, again, I would do exactly what I have done.  You just have to understand your requirements, and whether another $300 for a basic iPad is really worth it. The Android operating system looks like it is gaining very substantial industry acceptance, and is likely to be a serious contender in eating into Apples market share.  That means that more and more apps will be developed for the Kindle Fire in the very near future.One note, and I admit I am blowing my own horn:  When I bought my Kindle 3G/WiFI a few months ago (lost it), I played with the \"experimental browser.\"  I wrote at that time that Amazon really needed a touch screen because the browser was just impossible to use with the 5-way navigation button.  I am not that conceited that I would suggest that they listened to me ... but it does please me that they came to the same conclusion that I did.************ Edit/Update 3/10/2013******It has now been a year and a half since I purchased the KF.  While I am still content with it, I am no longer ecstatic.  A few flaws have surfaced in this time period:1.  The virtual keyboard is generally too small for adult fingers.  I find that I am backspacing over and over again to correct typos.2.  The Gorilla glass screen, while almost indestructible, is near impossible to use in sunlight --- sitting by the pool, etc.3.  AND THE MOST IMPORTANT --- the Android system used by this device is NOT STANDARD, and apps that are written for Android, and work on my smartphone, often do not work on the KF.  I could go on forever listing them, but one which I depend upon a lot is Weight Watchers Mobile (tm).  There are others as well, and I am finding that providers just aren't all that eager to create versions for the KF.  Market share?  Difficulty in maintaining them?  Whatever! This is the biggest shortcoming of this device.  When the time comes to replace it, I will probably go for something else that is standard.  It will never be an iPad or Windows device for my own personal reasons/prejudices, but you can be sure that Android standardization will be a major consideration.", "Date": "November 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Why are there any bad reviews ?", "Author": "Ms Lulubelle \"Lulubelle\"", "ReviewID": "R3LU3L0KXV33VN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Yes, if you compare it to a I-Pad, I'm sure it comes up a little short.

I bought two at exactly the same time and the issue I have is that they cannot be charged any longer.  The port looks fine but it will not charge when plugged in.

I'm really disappointed in the fact that they both tore up at the same time with the same issue and shortly after the warranty expired-I find that hard to believe that it could be a coincidence that both wouldnhave the same issue.

Also my children are entertained with the games and apps that I have downloaded especially for those long waits in the doctor's office or in a long car ride. The only thing I would recommend is a case/cover if you are going to allow kids to play as well. There are so many books available that I was flabergasted with my choices and I am still trying to catch up on all my reading! I also love that there is a lot of children's books available for the Kindle as well! I can multitask with my Kindle as I could never before - email, Facebook, reading, learning and so much more! The only down side is the battery, and it only seems to have a problem when it picks up the wi-fi signal while I am trying to read. It usually lasts a good six hours or so with the wi-fi connected and I am reading continuously. (which I can easily do).

It works fine and I passed along my old Kindle to my daughter. I have used the kindle fire while travelling in Europe, mostly for checking email on the go, and storing needed documents. I got the very useful app for editing or creating MS Office documents - Office Suite Pro, for only $0.99.The pros are the low price, small, but workable format, low weight, fairly rapid startup from power off. Amazon advantages are a free month or so of Prime Access (more free content and express delivery) and Audible recorded books - unfortunately, I was too busy to take advantage of that. Amazon provides free apps on a daily basis, some of which are worth getting.If you already have kindle content (ebooks and such) you have easy access - most tablets also have Kindle Reader apps.The cons are - well, really not much. Like any WIFI only device, it may not always be convenient while on the go, unless you hang out at libraries, Cafes etc., so I couldn't always sync Kindle Fire with my Laptop data (via drop box). If you have WIFI where you live or visit, you are ready to go. A cell phone option for Europe would be expensive (and only needed for a couple weeks). Another desirable option would be to sync files through a cable or USB port, which would have been practical. Consider a different tablet with USB (more and more available) if this is vital. They keyboard use useable but takes getting used to. It was much easier to type for Yahoo Mail with the dedicated app, compared to using the browser for web mail.The Kindle Fire offers a lot in a small inexpensive package, especially if you are more interested in content (ebooks, videos, music)", "Date": "August 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire", "Author": "Pamela Snyder \"proof/editor\"", "ReviewID": "R1H5P6QUFN0Z2L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Kindle Fire has been the best $199 I have spent in a very long time.

Since authors and my business associates are now using color pictures to augment their work, I would have very much enjoyed seeing their offerings in color, but it's not practical using the Fire's short battery life (4-6 hours tops with the wi-fi turned off and the backlight turned low). Color displays on the Fire are very attractive, but I primarily use the Kindle for reading books, trying to read a full-size novel without a recharge is nearly impossible. I often read 2-3 books in one sitting when travelling overseas, I won't be able to do so with the Fire.2. Glare. Reading outside is not an option. The Fire is fine indoors when tilted away from overhead lights.4. Cover - you have to buy your own, and it is necessary to have one.5. USB connection - Again, you have to purchase your own, or use one made for another device. The Fire only comes with an electrical connection.6. Transferring books or ARCs from other venders - not happening without a USB connection. You have to manually transfer .mobi books via USB from your computer.7. On/off switch. It's about the size of a large pinhead, difficult to find and push. If you have large fingers, it's best to use your fingernail or the tip of a pen.8. Scrolling: Finding books via the carousel is a bit tricky. When scrolling, the Fire is so sensitive you often zip past it, or download a book or document unintentionally.9. Highlighting - Difficult. It takes a very steady hand, or you will generally find that you highlighted a word or sentence either above or below your original objective. A little wiggle of your finger will inadvertently turn the page.Comments made by other Fire users on my previous (deleted - now revised) review not only mentioned I was less than intelligent (stupid) by not fully researching the Fire before purchase, but strenuously suggested I return the Fire and the additional products I bought to go with it.

Arrived back in April as promised!!! Took it out, did all the necessary registering, and I have been reading ever since. I really like this Kindle. I researched it and others for several years, and read many reviews from other web sites, gadget websites, etc. I was satisfied that a large % of reviews were positive, and favored the Kindle Fire. I finally decided to treat myself. This is really a nice e-reader. I have dl many free books,and bought maybe 1-3. I have plenty on my wish list waiting to be purchased, and a small amount in my \"cloud\" waiting to be read. I was going to go for the regular e-reader a few years back, but when the Fire came out I really liked looking at the color display. I can adjust the background color on the book pages, which is nice. I use off white. Seems to be softer on the eyes. The features on the Kindle are user friendly. I am not using it as a music gadget,(although the music thru Pandora sounds great, but don't use much)nor a reader for small children. I don't use it for typing, or pdf files etc. It is a simple way to read books and house them as well. They go where I go. The screen is very responsive when flipping thru to look for a book to read or play a game. Speaking of which, I did download a few games and word puzzles - again, great response. Love Hangman! Don't do apps yet. Fiddle with Pandora and whatever else came with the Kindle. Did download a Bible app and I tried to read it outside of the home until I realized Wi-Fi is needed. Other than that Wi-Fi works great in my home. Don't go to fastfood places,or coffeeshops. Haven't tried any airports - not sure if I would - they might take my Kindle. Most times I read with the Kindle plugged in. I am interested in getting several newspaper and magazine subscriptions, however, I am not totally sold on the idea. I just can't imagine getting the same viewing quality on an e-reader vs. just holding them. We will see. Love the Kindle. Recommend it as a great e-reader.

While it certainly isn't a full blown Android tablet, it does have some key features.  With Prime, we also get some free on-demand video from Amazon Instant Video, and some free books.Pros include:*Use of Amazon's AppStore for Android to download hundreds of apps like Netflix, Games, etc.*Easy to read adjustable screen*Reads many file types and can be used in conjunction with cloud servers such as box.com and Amazon Cloud*Full Color Display*Full Web Browser*Thin and appealing design*Free movies (with Prime)*Free books (with prime)Cons include:*cannot access some Android functionality like launchers, background changes, etc.*some apps are not -yet- supported, such as Google +, Gmail, etc.*no Google Play access*Wi-Fi onlyOverall, the Kindle fire has earned a 4 out of 5 because it lacks support for some things that I have come to associate with all Android devices and they do not support Google-apps.  There is no camera, and other features are missing so it is not a full-blown Android tablet.

The Nook does have some differences I wish the fire had.  Nook has more memory (via memory card upgrade) and battery lasts much longer.  But the Fire is much lighter in weight, better looking and by far has more Apps, books, and much easier access to music and easier music player.  The Nook keeps putting books on pre-order that I can get immediately on other sites (funny for a book store), their music player just stinks and there is very little music to choose from.  Everything on your computer must be sideloaded to the Nook where it is seamlessly added to the Fire even when you buy it using your PC.  For a real Geek the Nook may be a breeze to use.

I have always felt that there was no real need for me to own a tablet, because I own a laptop, smartphone, PS3, etc. What could I do on tablet that these other devices couldn't already do?I was initially interested in the Kindle Fire when it was announced and released, mainly because if I ever was to change my mind about tablets, $199 for one seemed a lot more financially sensible than upwards of $400 for a certain Apple product. Still, I never truly considered purchasing a Kindle Fire, or Nook Tablet, for that matter, until the day I saw Amazon selling the Kindle Fire for $139.00 as an Amazon Warehouse Deals special. In all honesty, my purchase of this Kindle Fire was mainly an impulse buy.But this impulse buy turned out to be an exceptional decision on my part. I am extremely satisfied with the Kindle Fire. I find the smaller overall size than most tablets and the 7\" screen to be perfect, and in many ways better than its larger counterparts. The Fire is easy to hold and using it is a breeze. The screen is perfect for reading, web browsing, streaming videos, etc. I have watched free content from the Prime Instant Video Service and my own movies as well, and even my Standard Definition movies look spectacular. The touch screen and keyboard work quite well and are responsive. The web browser is fast and easy to use. Battery life is excellent: I was at 44% and streamed a 2.5 hour movie from the Prime service; I still had 15% battery left to play Angry Birds and check Facebook.Overall, the Kindle Fire is a well-built, responsive tablet with a great size, great form-factor, great screen, and an enjoyable user experience. All of these good points, when combined with the Prime Instant Video service and the Kindle Owner's Lender Library, make the Kindle Fire one of, if not, the best tablet options for those looking to avoid a huge price tag while still getting an excellent and capable device.", "Date": "May 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "kindle fire", "Author": "chas", "ReviewID": "R3QO6R2ZZA4HQM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had it about a month now super easy to use.

At first I was hesitant to buy it because of the poor reviews but decided to give it a try, you can always return it. However, I found that the issues that these individuals had were fixed when I bought my Kindle. As soon I turned on my Kindle it had already updated to the 6.2 version which fixed all of the mentioned issues that those who gave the product a poor review would have known if they had given it a chance. Amazon quickly fixed the problems that users were complaining about but in many of the reviews I read the individuals only gave it a day before they returned it.  All technology is going to have its bugs and issues but you don't know if you don't try it. That's why I chose to wait until I used my Kindle Fire for a while before I wrote this review.So what is so great about the Kindle Fire?-Easy to use-Small, compact, light-Comfortable reading, doesn't strain eyes(Definitely lighter than my 3-4 hundred page books!)-Fast browsing-Good variety of free/cheap apps-Great for exercise machines-Great for traveling-Prime Membership Available(I especially like the lending library)-Cheap and large variety of books at your fingertipsI mainly use my Kindle Fire for reading, entertainment(apps, music), and excercise. I read a lot and the Kindle Fire along with Amazon Prime is perfect for me. It allows me to read a free book once a month and in between I can purchase books to read at a MUCH cheaper price than hard copy books and I don't have to wait for them to be shipped. The lending library does have a large variety of books to choose from. For someone who goes through books so quickly its nice to have such a large such selection of books at your fingertips.However, I have found one negative aspect of my Kindle Fire which is that the battery life is not nearly what it is supposed to be. This is the ONLY reason why I gave it for four stars and not five. The battery only lasts a few hours and I have asked friends if the same is true for them and they all said yes. However, this is a minor issue for me because I don't take my Kindle on the go to often and if I do I make sure it is fully charged.All in all I am satisfied with my purchase and think it is worth it.

I am an Android enthusiast and thought it would be a great little tablet to have. However , I started rationalizing that there were other tablets out there that I could pick up used or for 50 dollars more that would maybe get me a lot more tablet. Then I noticed that Amazon is now selling this model refurbished for 169 dollars. Refurbished means same device (mine is near mint, no blems, nada), same warranty, factory wiped/restored, and all new packaging. Only real difference? No quick start manual. I can live with that. As a prime member I paid the 4 bucks for the next day delivery. No worries. No regrets.All of the hardware limitations lamented by others (storage capacity/lack of sd card, no BT) are mostly mitigated by the 169 dollar price point, but the hardware pluses become even better: dual core processor, great screen (IPS), form factor is great, build quality is great. Software? It works. It's not ICS, but who cares? I know I could flash a custom ROM (I am an XDA lurker...My cell phone changes ROMs almost as much as I change underwear), but then I would lose easy access to Amazon Instant Video. The Amazon stock launcher isn't sexy, but it works. I am not getting the advertized battery life, but then that would be a device first if I did.I could see gearheads who like tinkering with gizmos passing on this, but for people who want something that just works and is affordable (but not cheesy)then I would pick up one of these refurbished Kindle Fires.And when the next iteration of the KF emerges?

It is more of a media tablet than a full function one - which is why Amazon can sell them for hundreds of dollars less than the other tablets. If you're looking for a tablet computer, this is probably not the device for you. If you're looking for something small enough to fit in a purse to use to read, play games, listen to music, web browse, and watch video then the Kindle Fire is just what you're looking for.Pros:-Good battery life (have had to charge it a couple times, but since I am not using it constantly, I can't tell you how long it last)-The color and sound are great for watching video. Obviously, if you're streaming from the internet, it may lag depending on how fast your internet is.-Great selection of apps (many that are free). There are apps for just about every age group. My two year old loves some of the free apps I've downloaded for him.-I really enjoy listening to music on my Fire. It's so much easier than dragging around my laptop or dealing with headphones for my MP3 player if I want to listen to music around the house.-Children's picture books - I love regular books for around the house so that my son can look at them on his own, but having them on the Fire is so convenient to occupy him in the doctor's office, while waiting on food at a restaurant, etc. There are also apps that let you read the book on your own, read with help, and have it read to you.-The internet browser is easy to use and is just as fast as the one on my laptop. You can have multiple tabs on the browser. Since the screen is fairly small, you will have to zoom and scroll around more than on the laptop/desktop.-Very user friendlyCons:-While the Kindle Fire is better for reading in low light/dark situations, I much prefer the E Ink display from the regular Kindle. Reading on the Fire is like reading on the computer screen, and the E Ink is a lot easier on the eyes.Other comments:-A lot of reviews complain about the carousel of recent items that takes up most of the screen. This doesn't bother me because the most recent apps are the ones I use the most anyway. If there's something on there that you don't want, you just tap and hold your finger there until the option menu comes up and you can remove it from teh carousel or the device. I don't really like that every book you have purchsed for the Kindle shows up in the carousel whether you've downloaded it to the device.-A lot of reviews also mentioned the lack of security. I can see how the initial security might be a problem since it comes registered to your account, but once the Kindle Fire is in your hands, you can add a password to be able to unlock the device. You can also add a password that is required to make purchases from Amazon. Just say that it's for a gift so that it's not registered to any account when you order it and initial security won't be a problem.Overall, I highly recommend the Kindle Fire. For what it is, it's a great product.

As somebody who is a technology geek, I'm hard to please on the mobile device front; I can always find problems that would completely remove the value of a product.

Let me give you a quick rundown.Great wi-fi speed.So easy to use, you can be a pro in minutes.Speedy downloaded(and a bundle of awesome free downloads!)Amazing display quality(crisp, clean, bright, what more could you want?)Sound quality makes it feel like you're standing at the concert/actually in the movie.Easy to navigate/customize your Kindle Fire.Compact; a lot of power in a small devicePortable; way more so than an iPad, or other larger tablets(can fit in a medium coat pocket.)And that is only some of them! If I had waited even two more hours to write this review, I would have another paragraph of upsides to add to this review. The only downside I can think of is that if you want to download an app - even a free one - from the app store that came on your Kindle, they will require you put in a credit card number, and a billing address. If you're a teenager like me, and don't have a credit card, I found a loophole(go to the amazon store, and search for your app - make sure its for the Kindle! Download it from there.) That is easy to use.All in all, if you're thinking about buying a a tablet for yourself or a loved one, for whatever reason, I suggest the Kindle Fire. It's fast, colorful, and best if all, affordable.

The best advice that I could give anyone when using this is to always used the tool bar where the BOOK/NEWSTAND/APPS etc are located. From there click on what you want to download. To purchase the items you need to click store from the area that you want to purchase (BOOKS/NEWSTAND/APPS) which would be on your top right side.  This will give you all the items that are for free or have a purchase price. If you use the WEB on the tool bar it will not download to your Kindle until you purchase it from the store.

I'm not a super techy person and this review will not be either.What I love about the kindle fire:-It's not a notebook, but meets all my needs: email, facebook, general surfing, and of course reading.-It's easy to navigate, no rocket scientist needed to operate. :)-It's a great size for my handbag and generally toting around.-It's been great entertainment for my 5yo when we're out. Think doc appointments, long car rides, ect. Games are much more fun than on my phone, children's books in color, and the awesome plus of stored movies.-The unlimited cloud storage is amazing. I love not having to be concerned with how much storage I have left when making a purchase.-Access to Amazon for purchaing books, or anything else for that matter, is really easy. Almost to easy....What I dislike about the kindle fire:-As far as I can tell there is no way to organize my books into folders like I did on my kindle keyboard. By having everything organized it was easy to find the book I was looking for, where now I have to search. If anyone knows of a way to do this, please leave me a comment!-I was really looking forward to getting magazines on the fire, but I'm not really impressed with this aspect. When you exit out of your mag, the fire doesn't automatically hold your page like in a book so I end up having to find where I left off. Just a small annoyance...The color is great, but of course you have to zoom in on each page to read the text, just like when viewing a web page.-My biggest problem with the fire is using the keyboard. It's sensitive so there are lots of typos. The word auto-correct is a bit strange in that after you click the word you want it also puts a space after it automatically. I hit space myself which causes it to put a period and start a new sentance with a capitol letter. So there's a lot of back spacing to correct that. I'm not sure if that all makes sense or not...I'll just say it's less frustrating to type on my phone than the fire. It's fine for a sentance or two but not much more.I would definitely purchase the kindle fire again. With all it's able to do it is almost like having another notebook in the house.

The only thing I would change is that there are no page numbers!  No matter, the Kindle automatically remembers where you left off and tells you what percentage of the book you've read.  No more wrist strain from holding the book open.  The dictionary app that comes with it is kind of useless and hard to manage because you can't just search a word and click.  You actually have to flip through it to find the word!  I also love the relationship Amazon has with Kindle.  It is very well integrated.

That being said normally I am an avid reader at first I was a little hesitant on reading on the KF. It felt odd not to be able to feel the book and the pages in my hand. That sounds kinda odd but if you are a reader you know what I'm talking about. After a bit I got used to reading on the KF it became natural. A really neat feature is that you can touch the word in a book and the definition pops up that's pretty useful because I don't have to turn my laptop and google the word which distracts me from my reading. Also besides reading the App Store has so many fun Apps to play like Angry Birds, Cut the Rope, Where's My Water, etc.  I like to watch netflix movies on my KF and it's great for that purpose. The browser is quick, fast, and easy to use. Don't listen to all those people saying there are so many bugs because there aren't. Also finally if you were worried about having to buy books on the KF you don't need to because there's a big supply of free books, and you can rent library books from the comfort of your home.", "Date": "January 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire", "Author": "Rob Parker", "ReviewID": "R3LCJMPEBH98T8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife loves her Kindle Fire, says it's the best gift I ever got her.

I was never one who thought I would get an e-reader for the simple reason that I love the feeling of a good book in my hands, and reading it on a screen just didn't seem very special. I did some research on it anyway and realized this thing might be pretty neat. It was like a cheaper version of an iPad. I figured it would be way easier when traveling, and the fact that I could get on the internet and buy apps really sold me on it, so i asked for it for Christmas. I was pretty excited and was not looking forward to the week and a half wait until I could play with it. Then, to my surprise, it came early. I ordered it December 25th...It came December 28th. That made my day. Needless to say, I tore into the box and immediatley began paying with it. I haven't stopped since. I have barely used any other electronic since. As an AVID youtube watcher, I watch all my videos through it, I am constantly downloading new free apps (I am so pleased with the selection of good free ones) and I even do my homework on it since the internet is so fast. I get my email through it and download pictures onto it (and the speed of my Fire is still going strong.) The only thing I might ever say negativley, is that the screen will freeze up (very rarely), in which case I just push the sleep button on and off and it works like new. It also dies pretty quickly, but that's no problem. I REALLY love this product and would happily recommend it to anyone.

I immediately downloaded many free books and a few apps for my little toddler to play with. He now has a virtual aquarium and feeds his fish daily. I use an anatomy app, drawing app, music app, weather app, and a few other informational or mind-bending apps.This reader is perfect for reading, movies, listening to streaming music, surfing the web or checking email. We got Netflix on it right away, and can watch whatever we want. In bed we prop it up on a pillow for viewing. It is so lightweight and the perfect size, it is easy to use sitting on an airplane or lying down.One very nice thing I noticed when I opened the box is that it was packaged completely with molded cardboard. No hard clamshell plastic or styrofoam! I was thrilled. I threw everything into the recycle bin!The unit got to the house in about 10 days. The sound quality is excellent. The color screen is vibrant. The glass on the screen cleans perfectly with the swipe of a shirt sleeve (not at all like the glass on a pair of glasses or a computer screen--much easier to clean). It has a rubber boot of sorts, and while we have never dropped it, I'm sure the rubber would help. It does need charging more often than a plain reader - the movie streaming tends to pull battery quicker. We don't mind though. The benefits far outweigh a charge every 10 hours.Overall this was the perfect purchase.

(Good option over VRead/LeapPad/iXl)", "Author": "Jersey Bricks \"BrIcKs\"", "ReviewID": "R3UYEPSWWW4KYV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First i want to say that i purchased a Fire for my 6 year old daughter and my two year old that just turned three.  Most people thought i was crazy to buy this for them because of the possible learning curve. The reason why i chose this for them is because every other option didn't make sense price wise.  They both had LeapPads and V-Readers.  The Vreaders stopped functioning with only a year of use.  Both Leap Pad and VReaders require you to buy cartridges, which can easily become alot pricier than the Fire.  I noticed that my three year old loved playing with my smartphone(Droid Bionic), a lot more than playing with the V-Readers/LeapPad.  Ipads were out of the question, too expensive to trust in the hands of a toddler. So i took the plunge on the Fires.  VERY PLEASED.  Just think about it, with the Fire your child has LOTS of inexpensive and FREE apps to choose from.  I set up both Kindles the night before Christmas and added tons of learning apps.  I also added a couple drawing, reading, and cartoon apps.  The two year old has no problem navigating her Kindle, which amazes me.  She even watches some of her favorite shows using my Netflix account.  Simple interface even for a toddler.  Best purchase i've made for my girls.  Out of all of the Christmas presents they have received, they use the Fires every day.The only negatives are the one-step buying system. My account notifies me anytime a purchase is made through my Amazon account.  The six year old bought a .99 cent app one day, but i was able to be refunded because i caught it within the 15 minute window.  I explained to both of my girls the difference between FREE and PAID apps, and that has seemed to work so far.If you are considering buying a kids learning device for your child, i highly recommend the Kindle Fire.  It just makes sense considering the price of the other kid targeted products which suck you into buying cartridges.  I would also like to state that my girls received Fisher Price iXLs for Christmas.  They played with those things for a couple of hours and went right back to their Fires.

They will not be readers until they do. It is so nice to have a common interest with the teens. I think I would like to purchase another kindle for more adult reading and save this one as reference for them. I haven't figured out yet how to completely delete a book from my devise.

It's a great and enjoyable little device, very useful for various purposes - but not without flaws. I hope this review may help you decide if KF is the right choice for you.1) SCREEN. It's just beautiful! Nice, sharp picture, great resolution, beautiful colors, fast response. And it's 7\" - IMHO the best compromise between mobility and usability. Glare? Well, what can I say... it's quite bad, as with any other tablet out there. It is virtually unusable in the direct sunlight.2) SPEED. It's way faster than I expected from a device in that price range. Animations, zooming in-out, videos... all work smooth and nice.3) SIZE. With 7\" screen, and not too thick frame around it, I'd say it has just the right dimensions - big enough for a pretty comfortable use, and still small enough to be able to always carry it around with you without a need for a big bag.4) BATTERY. Well, again, as with most tablets out there today, battery life is not KF's strong point either. It will serve you for several hours of intensive use at best. But that's the price you have to pay today for that nice, colorful, shiny back-lit screen and a fast enough processor.5) PRICE. Unbeatable on the market today. Amazon does not make money from selling Kindle Fire itself, but from what they hope you will buy from Amazon store to use on it - books, videos, comics, applications, ... That's why the price is so low.5) OVERALL LOOK AND FEEL. In a single word - great, for both hardware and software. Especially for the price.6) NON-US USERS. Ouch! This is where Kindle fails pretty bad. Non US users will still be able to purchase books and videos, but they can forget about applications. Not even free applications can be downloaded from Amazon App Store without a US credit card! Don't know why Amazon made such a decision, maybe it has something to do with legal reasons... but I am sure there is a way to overcome that and I hope Amazon will address this soon. Until then, KF will stay far less popular outside US than it could be.7) READING PDFs. Though AZW or mobi format is still much more comfortable, reading PDFs with Kindle Fire is a way better experience then with any other 6\" e-ink Kindle. With the device in landscape mode, most A4 documents will be pretty fine to read - that additional 1\" alone make a lot of difference... plus it is much easier and faster to scroll and zoom in/out when needed.8) READING COMICS. Pretty nice. Colors, easy and fast zoom in and out makes comic reading... well, maybe not perfect, but still a pretty enjoyable experience.9) COMPARISON TO OTHER KINDLES. The decision to use a standard capacitive touch screen is what makes Fire completely different from other Kindles, and puts it among tablets rather than e-readers. Is it a good or a bad thing? Well, depends on what you want to use it for. E.g. unlike other Kindles, you can watch videos and play games on your Fire just fine. It has a back-lit screen, so you can read from it in the dark without external source of light. Any screen operation is a way, way faster than with any other Kindle. And not to forget - it has colors! On the other hand, reading from any other Kindle that uses slow e-ink screen instead, feels way closer to reading from paper - has much, much less glare, and can be used to read in bright sunlight. E-ink also consumes so little battery that it can literary be used for a month without a need to recharge. Plus, a 6\" e-ink Kindle is much cheaper even than Kindle Fire!But when it comes to reading there is still one very important area where Kindle Fire does a much better job than any 6\" e-ink Kindle - reading PDFs! (I know, there is Kindle DX out there that handles PDFs quite well, but IMHO it is too large and too expensive to be considered an appropriate alternative).All in all, I am quite happy with my Kindle Fire. Good job with this one, Amazon. If you know what you want to use it for, are aware of it's pros and cons for that purpose, and are still considering whether you should get yourself one - I'd say: go for it.

Unfortunately for me, all of my classes this semester require me to read something, or several things, for every single meeting. There's also almost always an assignment attached to the readings, and we are supposed to bring these readings with us to class. I noticed a classmate had one of the older versions of the Kindle and figured, hey, why not? However, I saw the potential in the Fire to double as a tablet PC of sorts... and I couldn't have chosen better.I have an android phone, and the functionality for both my phone and the Kindle Fire is spectacular. For books, you can tap the edge of the screen to turn pages just like you would an old-school Kindle, which is a nice feature because I hate having to \"flip the page\" with my finger every time. Also, there's the option to highlight text which, while a little tricky, is very nifty- especially because 6 of my books that I've downloaded are for my classes. Typing \"long ways\" is somewhat clumsy, but that's hardly anything to complain about. If I want to type something longer than a couple of paragraphs, I'd just use my laptop. The web browser is very quick, and downloads the documents my teachers post for us to read/ bring to class very simple. Once the document is downloaded, obviously, it's accessible without connection to a wi-fi network. Besides the ease of use, the display itself is simply gorgeous. Watching videos, even if it's just on YouTube, is a sight to behold.One of the greatest features of this, and the other Kindle devices, is the Cloud drive. I already have an app for this on my phone, but it is even more useful for the Fire. For anyone who doesn't know, any music or books that you have uploaded (or downloaded) onto your cloud drive are accessible instantly with connection to wi-fi or, if you prefer, you can download them from the Cloud onto the device itself for access without wi-fi connection. Better yet, all Amazon purchases take up no space whatsoever! So, if you look at the free space on the cloud and think 5GB is not enough, it's actually (potentially) unlimited space.tl; dr? This thing is worth every penny. I literally made the decision to purchase the Fire in under 20 minutes after deliberation with some friends, and I am completely pleased.

What are my complaints about this Kindle Fire? Nothing that's worth mentioning here. I have yet bought a device that comes out of the box being perfect. NEVER!!!! And I have plenty believe me. I must say that my expectations were very low before I bought this fire. After I played with it the first day, I was very impressed with this device. Navigating the device is just as smooth as an Ipad. My Samsung Galaxy sucks very bad in comparison. I must admit that I have yet to utilize it for reading digital books.

It really bugs me to read bad reviews by people who obviously did not take the time to read the specifications of this tablet before purchasing.  They can't understand why it doesn't work overseas or why it doesn't have 3g capability and why it can't do the same as a laptop or notebook or the sound doesn't have a physical control on the outside of the unit.....read, people and educate yourself before buying.  I purchased this at our local Best Buy so I could play with it to see if it was worth it.....That was all part of the research process too. If I needed to return it, then I could just take it back there and not hassle with shipping.My husband has owned an iPad since December 2010 and it is fun to play on but he needs it for work so I didn't get to use it much.  I wouldn't even compare the iPad and Kindle fire because they are not meant to be one in the same.

It wasn't designed to be an iPad junior, it isn't marketed as an iPad junior and it will never BE an iPad junior.Now that that's over the truth. This is one hell of a little device. It is not only great for reading but it does all the things I normally do on the 'net (read mail and check the weather - I know, I know - pretty mundane). AND it does them well. It's fast and responsive. I have to admit the built-in browser (Silk) simply isn't what Amazon cracked it up to be but it does the job and there are alternatives in the app store if you just can't stand it. Since I'm always in a wi-fi hotspot I do not miss having access to a 3G network. The app store is kinda limited compared to others but that is relative. Do you really need over 50,000 apps (or whatever the number is now)? I personally feel Amazon did a pretty good job of overlaying their take on Android. This is my first experience with any kind of Android op system and I don't have a problem with it. I've seen a bunch of websites where you can learn to 'root' the Fire if you are so inclined but imho why mess with a good thing? It is what it is and it is good just as it is out of the box.Oh yeah - then there's the price. If you find a better tablet for the price please let me know. I am so pleased with mine I already got another one for a friend. I feel that if you get one and give it a chance, without constantly comparing it to a device costing at least 3 times as much, you will be very pleased. (And yes I do have an iPad but the Fire is quickly becoming my 'go-to' device for quick access).Is the Fire perfect? Heck no. It is still a little 'touchy' on the home screen (way to easy to scroll over what you want to stop on) and the browser needs work. Apparently the Amazon version of Android isn't the greatest (that's for you to decide) but that will probably improve with future firmware updates from Amazon. And some people seem to have a little harder time reading on a back-lit screen as opposed to an e-ink screen. But all in all I love my Fire and wouldn't hesitate to get another if something drastic happened to it.If you need/want a tablet and don't have one why not give the Fire a try? It's a very good little device and, as always, Amazon is the very best about refunds and returns if you don't like it.

A lot of people have been writing bad reviews because for lack of better words, it's not an Ipad. They're right. This isn't an Ipad. It's a Kindle, but has more than JUST reading on it. I originally wanted just a Kindle, but I'm really glad I got a Fire.Not only can I read books (Which I've already read 3- I'm not much of a reader, but this makes it more fun), but I also have the ability to use the internet, play games (As far as apps), listen to music. The storage on the Cloud is super convenient for all these things. A lot of people hate that they have to go through Amazon to do everything. Again, it's a Kindle. An AMAZON KINDLE. It's just like having to go to the Apple store to do things with anything \"apple\" related. If you're not wanting to use this for reading primarily, then go get a different tablet. If you don't like amazon, go get a different tablet. I love the Fire and personally wouldn't feel the need to have anything -more- than it has to offerMy ONLY complains:- The touchcreen works great. It's got a great picture on it. the only down fall is the backlit part of it (As with any tablet). Again, I've read q bit on it, and while you can change the background of whatever book you're reading, its still like reading off a computer monitor. After a while, my eyes would hurt and I'd have to set it down for a few before I picked it back up. I would also recommend getting a screen protector that is matted so that it reduces some of the glare. I'm not worried about the screen getting scratched, as it's made from a really good glass, but the glare can get annoying if you're reading.- The weight. It's pretty heavy for an e-reader. Now, I've never had an e-reader or tablet, but after a while, it gets pretty heavy to simply hold. I typically rest it on my legs, or on some other surface to give my wrists a break. I bought a case for it, which helps a bit.Overall, I'd give it a 9 out of 10. I haven't had really any glitches on it so far. It's frozen up on me two times at the most, but it doesn't take more than 1-2 minutes to restart it, so to me, it's not that big of a deal. And again, as long as I've had it, it's only 2 times. It's still a new product. Amazon is doing a great job at getting feedback about it, and like any electronics piece, it will have updates to run more smoothly.

I love that they have a free app a day.One of the negative things reviews have said is about the power button being on the bottom... well you can just turn the kindle fire around so the power button is on top, it's really not a big deal. I do that when I'm reading so I don't accidentally hit it, although even with the power button on the bottom I have never accidentally hit it.The ONLY negative thing I have personally encountered with the Fire is sometimes the wifi will shut off and I'll have to reconnect. Also, when I had my dad at my house on his Kindle Fire and my brother on his laptop and we were all using the Wifi, it would seem to kick us off the internet sometimes.

I need to start by saying that I am glad that I got the kindle for Christmas. I have a regular kindle with keypad and we have a tablet plus any other electronic device that people may want so when the kindle option was presented to me I wasnt really wanting one. I was surprised at Christmas with it and I do like it. There are some things that I do hate with it however.I love the graphs on the fire. I could not ask for better graphics, content or speed when downloading. My daughter has all her music on it (contempary christian and children tunes like the chipmonks). I have amazon music on my palm pixi phone but was not able to \"sync\" it to the fire and ended up purchasing same songs again. The volume level is fine with me but my daughter plugs it into a separate \"music bullet type of device\" and jams out to music in her room. The movie selection is great! I definietely recommend becoming a \"prime\" customer. It is small enough that I can keep it in my purse and she can watch shows/movies when we travel. We havent really used our portable dvd player in the car since we got the fire.I love the books the same as I did with my keypad kindle but I love that I can see it at night, without an exteral light, while I am in bed at night. It may hurt some people's eye to read that way but mine have been good so far (knock on wood!). I HATE that it does not have the \"read out loud\" option on fire, like it does on my other kindle. I used that feature A LOT and miss it on the fire!! My daughter wanted it to read one of her books out loud to her just the other day and I had to explain that the fire doesnt do that like my other one. It is a shame that I have better graphics and a touch screen that is perfect for my preschooler but she can only have books read to her in the app books! There need to be more apps for read out loud children books since that feature was eliminated from the normal book part of the fire.The apps are great too! I am not big into online games and apps therefore I do not have much to compare to... but the ones that I play the most are great! And I have found many educational apps for my child. I am happy with the app store/amazon store selections.Sometimes the web takes a while to load (but I am using a mobile hot spot from my phone and downloading elaborate sites) and other times it loads quickly... once loaded the web is great. We go to sites like \"bearville.com\" and play online games. It is definitely not like playing on a lap top or desk top but... it works. (It doesnt work on our tablet - would love to hear how it works on various tablets, just to end my curiosity)It is a little awkward to hold. I think it is a bit heavy (not as heavy as a zoom) but a shock from the thin and light keypad kindle. I am constantly turning it off while reading! The placement of the power button is rediculous! I graze over it all the time while holding my fire in the bed at night and my daughter turns it off when she holds it against her stomach. It is very annoying. Plus it doesnt  seem to keep a charge very long -- or it defected and turns itself off all the time.So I am verrrrrry disappointed that it doesnt read that books outloud, almost outraged about it really. It seems like it was left out for greed... so that people will have to purchase read out loud apps.

I purchased it as a trial. It is not perfect, but it is a great device that does many things very well, and  I will happily keep it. I will only review some of the features of this device as I have used them so far:- The wi-fi reception is really good wherever there is a consistent signal. I have seen no difference with my laptop (MacBook).- The touch screen is very responsive. Does it register every single tap? No, but it does most of the time, and I don't find it horribly inconvenient to have to repeat my taps every now and then.- I really like it as an e-reader. I also own a 3rd generation Kindle, and in general the Fire compares very well. True, it is heavier and has more glare. Unfortunately, I do a lot more reading in bed than on the beach, and for that I prefer having a backlight. I love the color and font settings, the dictionary function and the quick links to the web (Wikipedia) to find out more about some words. On the down side, the Fire does not allow changing the default dictionary or organizing books in folders, very useful features in earlier Kindles. This should be improved in a future update.- I think that Amazon advertisement overstates the case about the web browser, raising expectations to unreasonably high levels. Still, web browsing is quite fast and enjoyable (again, where there is a good signal). Flash audios and videos work very well, and the speed of access to many mobile sites (access to these can be set as a default) is actually impressive. The pinch-to-zoom feature works flawlessly, and it helps if you want to make sure you tap on the right hypertext link.- I am not a big game player, but I do test-play games I download for my kids. Of course, the quality of games is variable, but I have never found the Fire to be limiting in any way, and the controls are usually very responsive. Incidentally, I have not had any issues with my kids (seven and nine) using the Fire to purchase anything without my permission, but if they ever did, it would absolutely not be the Fire's or Amazon's fault, but my own. I sympathize with many other reviewers that have expressed this simple notion before. I will also add that the Fire is extremely useful in road trips with children.- Video playing is very good. The screen is relatively small, and I would always use anything bigger if available (a laptop, a desktop, a TV set), but it is still a perfectly enjoyable experience to stream a movie to the Fire.- Audio is a lot better than I thought. When listening to music, headphones or earphones are best for high quality sound, but I find the built-in speakers quite satisfactory if background noise is not too high. And the size of the Fire makes it possible to go around the house or to do yard chores while listening to your favorite music or radio show. The on-screen volume controls work perfectly fine, and I don't find the lack of volume control buttons to be a problem. Streaming from the cloud works very well.- The location of the power button seems to upset a lot of people. In a month of frequent use, I have hit the power button three times. I got an on-screen message asking me whether I was sure I wanted to shut down the Fire, which I declined. I understand that different people have different ways to hold a device like this one, but this is clearly not an unsolvable problem. And if you are buying any protective case, it will be more difficult to hit that button.- The battery life is acceptable, but not great. Depending on use, I found it to be between 6 and 10 hours. It seems to charge in 2-3 hours. I think there is room for improvement here in future versions.Overall, a very solid device that I can recommend to anybody as an e-reader, web-browsing device (only over wi-fi!), music player and game player.", "Date": "January 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire - Love It!", "Author": "gandg22", "ReviewID": "R21BURN250QAB5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Prior to purchasing it - I researched just about everything there was to read about it - both the pros and the cons.

It is frustrating and I hope that Amazon figures this out and offers a patch.Other than the periodic freeze it does work great, with nice crisp color, fast load times; it does take some thinking to find certain items and get to them but for the most part I am glad about the purchase; and it allows me to use my other kindle or laptop while my husband uses the FIRE and in rare cases he will be using the laptop and I need to access the web at the same time. He only uses the web but is unhappy with the size and awkwardness of a laptop and hates the touch pad on a laptop so the FIRE is a blessing for him.

LOVE that I can download Netflix; discovered \"Breaking Bad\" and got hooked, barely taking a break between episodes.  Love playing Words with Friends on it.  Easy.  Love that it is easy to hold and that I can use it late at night with earphones and not disturb my partner as I gobble up \"Breaking Bad\" all night long.  Colors are bright; screen display is good. The touch keypad is pretty functional, but can get a little tough to manipulate if you prefer to type with your thumbs on it horizontally, as I do.  I use my regular Kindle for books, so I won't be bothering much with the Fire for that.One really annoying aspect is that the volume is not loud enough even at its loudest, and no, I am not hard of hearing.  I have to use the earphones even when it shouldn't be necessary because I get much better sound through them. I hope they can figure that out.  Also, it would be helpful to have an external volume button so you don't have to interrupt what you are watching to go in, tap the Volume bar and try to raise the audio.  Won't matter.  It won't go very high, anyway, so I turn it down only when I use the earphones.  Which is pretty much most of the time.  Another little wrinkle is that the touch screen does not always work easily.  I have had to tap several times to bring up the page I want, but it does eventually work.I have AOL e-mail, and I find it is not always easy to access it or to send messages.  In fact, several e-mails that I sent out were never received and they never showed up in my \"Sent\" box.  So I don't know what is happening there.  Could be AOL, I don't know.  It has not been the most reliable lately.Overall, I think it is a great alternative to the $500 iPad, but I do think that, if I wanted to spend the money, I might actually prefer that.

This is because the Kindle Fire does not have 3G. This is not important to me though because often using internet with 3G can be very pricey. But, if 3G is important to you in a tablet, you should not purchase this tablet.Cameras: The Kindle Fire lacks a camera. So that means no Skype, video chatting, or taking pictures with it.Microphone: This also doesn't allow you to send voice messages or video chat.So if you don't want to spend a fortune, don't care if it doesn't have 3G, and don't care if it doesn't have a camera or microphone, then this is the tablet for you!", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very Nice!", "Author": "Mick", "ReviewID": "R3QX5UCF4QMC0P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "No complaints at all.

So far so good. I have toyed around with it for about 3 hours here and there. Only negative thing that I have to say about the Fire so far is that it doesn't have Parental Controls or Parental Block. I would like to block inappropriate material while web surfing. I have contacted Amazon today 12/20/11 and was told that at this moment they do not have that option but they are working on software and updates for the Kindle Fire. Needless to say I am very disappointed. However I have found an app for a \"kid safe lock\"; it only shows downloaded books and games on that particular app screen. The web is password protected and I have done some research via google and to limit web access it states to just cut the wi-fi off which is another solution. Hope this helps parents of younger children like myself. All in all, I believe my daughter will be very happy come Christmas morning. :) By the way this is my first review but I feel very strongly about monitoring what children view on the internet/web, so I wrote this because I was not informed when I made this purchase.

Me I wanted no contract,no hidden costs, I wanted a device for what i needed. That is where the Kindle Fire shines. If everyone goes by the flaws of a product, than you might as well get rid of all your device's!

I have not yet tried to install any apps from other sources, although I understand that the option exists.My main complaints are basically the same that have been expressed by many others about sometimes sluggish performance or locking up. Also, the Fire is a bit heavy for its size and would definitely be more convenient to hold unsupported if it  were a few ounces lighter.  One design choice that I am not happy about is the decision to make the default vertical orientation with the power button, headphone and usb port on the bottom of the device. Most apps seem to support rotating the device. 180 degrees, but that is not always the case. Sometimes I'll have earbuds in the headphone jack and/or charging the device while using an app that I want to view holding the device vertically, so having the ports on the bottom is not ideal.

I don't have an android phone or any other touchpad device, so I'd assume a lot of the other more negative reviews come from people who've had more experience with apps, etc., and find things missing in the Fire that I wouldn't notice or expect of it. But it does what I ask of it.  The interface was something I didn't so much learn how to use but just understood. It accesses Netflix, hulu+ and Prime videos easily. (In fact, with the recent *horrible* changes to Xbox's Netflix and hulu+ interfaces, I find myself preferring my Fire for streaming). It's much better than I expected to read with, and I enjoy Pulse very much. I've purchased just a couple apps: solitaire; a notepad; Accuweather; etc. I find games lure me away from reading, so I'm going to keep those at a minimum. As accessories, I'd bought an Arkon Portable Fold-Up Stand for my keyboard Kindle, and found that it re-poses and works beautifully, holding my Fire upright on my desk - I'd recommend this simple stand to anyone. A capacitative pen keeps the glass clean and glossy.  So, at this point, I am well satisfied with the value and performance of the Fire. If I had to come up with something negative, forgiving it the fact that I really need something with which to hold it more comfortably while reading in a chair...

Colors are just amazing; the speed is lightning fast compared to other similar tablets I've had, such as the Pandigital Novel 7 with Kindle.

And the reading of periodical samples and books is just fantastic.  I ordered the CaseCrown Ace Flip Case in the Campfire Brown to go with it based on the five star reviews I looked at for the product line.  Appears they are both made for each other. I would recommend Fire to anyone who's looking for a work of art that's practically ready to go right out of the box, with very easy navigation, intuitive icons and straight forward instructions.  Speaking of which, Amazon has done superb job on the easy of use instructions they have on their Web site.  I love the way they have it split into sections, such as starting out with Fire, reading with Fire, etc., etc.  I also joined Prime - I think for the money, for someone like me, who orders stuff from Amazon all the time and just love to read, it's an excellent deal.  And I can have my wife added to the program - all you have to do is send an \"invitation\" to the party you want to use your Prime account.  They sign up with their own Amazon account and they have use of all the Prime privileges you got yourself.  Again, a good deal.

Silk is really smooth, and pretty fast. It's much nicer than using my phone to surf the net. The more I have used the browser Silk, the fast it becomes (like it knows where I am going to go next) For those who have complained about it, I'm not sure what your  doing, but mine is great. Another reviewer said it may be the wifi you're using...I would agree!Movies: on both Amazon & NetflixQuality is decent. But what do you expect, its wifi, on a 7\" screen. Its not going to be like your home LED/LCD/Plasma TV. Its portable! If you are planning on using this as your TV set, then think again.The UI is smooth, there are a few things that could be better like the scrolling on the home screen...slightly too sensitive for my taste, but It's fine for me.Reading on it will not be something I will not be doing for an extended period. I will use my 3g kindle for that. If just to read for a short time, it will do. Backlighting tends to hurt my eyes after a while.Amazon App Store for the Kindle Fire is somewhat lacking, but its brand new, and amazon has put a lot of restrictions on what apps are available for the Fire. As time goes on, their will be MANY more apps available...Being a prime member for 4+ years, It's another item that I will be keeping, and when their 3g version comes out, I will be buying that as well (though hoping for some sort of trade-in).If you're a amazon prime member, I can't see why you wouldn't purchase one.....it's only $200!

I considered several other tablets/eReaders (iPad, Nook, Sony eReaders and a host of other lesser known brands) before finally deciding to go with the Kindle.My main purpose of wanting an eReader/Tablet was to read. That's it. Personally, if I need to check email or Facebook on the go, I have a smartphone for that. Anything more serious can be done with a laptop. I'm an avid reader but finding a physical bookstore has become nearly impossible so the idea of a tablet that easily connects to the internet to download books seemed ideal. While 2-day shipping is great, 30 second digital transfers are even better.The Kindle Fire excels at being an eReader. The design is sleek and fits perfectly in one hand. For me, this was the single factor that took the iPad out of the running. The iPad is enormous (and expensive for just reading) compared to the Kindle Fire. With the Kindle Fire, the pages turn seamlessly with a light swipe anywhere on the screen and going back and forth between different screens is equally as easy.You can change the text, dim or brighten the screen and make changes to the background. One thing that I loved about this compared to the others was how easy it is on the eyes. After 3-4 hours of staring at it, my eyes don't hurt and there are no strange lingering images after looking away.So far, I have had no glitches or instances where it freezes or becomes unusable. I use my Kindle Fire at least 5-6 days a week usually for 3-4 hours at a time. The battery stays charged with 3-4 hour use for about 3 days with wifi on and about 4 days with wifi off.WhisperNet is great. Books transfer seamlessly with the wifi on and it's so fast. I also have the Kindle app on my iPhone and so far, it's been really good about picking up on the exact page from one device to the other. Of course, there is not a 3G or 4G wifi option but finding a wireless connection is not difficult thus this wasn't a deal breaker for me. WhisperNet does not work with books not purchased though Amazon aka if you download a book from somewhere other than the kindle bookstore, you can't read it between your devices.On a short plane ride, I purchased movies for my six month old nephew to watch during the flight. Although this wasn't the intended purpose I was pleasantly surprised at how great the colors and motion came though. The Kindle stayed charged through about 3.5 hours of constant video play while waiting for boarding, during the flight and on the drive from the airport to our destination. I began reading that evening and after an additional 20 minutes, the 15% battery life warning came up.On the few occasions that I have used the internet, it's been better than expected but not flawless. Connecting to various wifi networks is easy. Purchasing books is problem-free of course.  Using other websites such as Google and going to links through it has been quick. Depending on the site, it may time some time to load so if patience is a challenge for you and internet use is extremely important another tablet such as the Nexus 7 may be a better fit.Again, the Kindle Fire, from my experience is designed as an eReader with internet, video and various other capabilities. Its ultimate purpose is for reading and it does an outstanding job at this. I would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting a tablet for this purpose.", "Date": "August 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love my Kindle Fire", "Author": "Baby RN", "ReviewID": "R12JEMSWBKXQHN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I do love my Kindle Fire!

I love my iPhone but if I had to choose between my iPad, (top of the line) or my Kindle Fire I would select my Kindle Fire.I love movies and this is what I use my iPad and my Kindle Fire for the most.  One cannot view all types of movies on an iPad because the software on the iPad device does not support flash a necessary component of many videos. I own many Amazon Instand Videos which are stored in my online Amazon Library.  They cannot be used on the iPad. The best part of buying movies from Amazon and not iTunes is that you can download your movies or watch them by streaming.  I do both.  I may download a movie watch it and then delete it on my Kindle Fire.  It is still available in my online Amazon library waiting for the next viewing.  I actually have paid a little more for some movies on Amazon because I can stream or store or both.  If I buy movies from iTunes I have to download them on my PC and they bloat up my computer's storage.  I also watch Netflix on my Kindle Fire. Nice picture.  I think the Kindle Fire is sturdier then my iPad.  I use my Kindle Fire every day when I use my treadmill.  The picture is clear and the straming is perfect.

Medlin", "ReviewID": "R2YAWK6BN3S6YN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Kindle Fire is an excellent tablet for the price.  I purchased a refurbished Kindle Fire when it was the Gold Box deal of the day for $139 and have been very happy with it overall with a few small caveats.Should you buy a refurbished Kindle Fire?  I highly recommend it.  You get the same 1 year warranty as a new one, and I honestly could not tell that mine was refurbished.  When it arrived it was packaged as if it was new and there were no signs of use whatsoever - it looked brand new, and has worked perfectly ever since!Pros:+ Inexpensive+ Excellent, intuitive user interface+ Nice high resolution IPS display+ Performance - applications, media, and web browsing are fast+ Tight integration with Amazon media services (video, music, books, etc.)+ Minimalist designCons:- Some applications in the Amazon App Store are not available for the Kindle Fire- Besides music, Amazon Cloud Drive is not fully integrated into the OS- No \"advanced features\" such as GPS, bluetooth, or wireless 3G (honestly, you can't really expect these at such a low price point)Design:The design is minimalist - the only thing on the front of the tablet is the display.  There is only 1 button (the power button) on the bottom of the tablet next to the micro-usb charging port.  There is a headphone jack on the other side of the micro-usb port.  There are two small speakers on the top of the device, but are barely noticeable as they are incorporated into the bezel. The back is made out of rubberized plastic which feels soft in your hands and is not slippery.Hardware:If you are reading this review you have probably already looked at the specifications - I won't rehash the processor speed, RAM, storage space, etc.  I will say that the processor and RAM are more than adequate for anything that I have done - applications load quickly and run well, videos and music play without any problems, and web browsing with the silk browser is fast.  I was worried that the 8Gb of storage (about 6Gb user available) on the device would not be enough, but since essentially everything but your applications is in the cloud, I have not even come close to maxing out the available storage.User Interface:I have plenty of experience with both Android and iOS devices. Before buying the Kindle Fire I was skeptical about the heavily modified android OS it uses. It turns out I was pleasantly surprised.  The \"home screen\" is much different than most android devices.  At the top there is a search bar and tabs for all of the Amazon services (newsstand, books, music, video, docs, apps, and web).  Underneath that is a carousel of recently used apps, and at the bottom are your favorites - these can be applications, specific web pages, books - pretty much anything you use often and want to put there. This works well as the web, applications, and all Amazon services are just one touch away.  The only downside to this is that there are no widgets unlike other android devices.  However, if you really like the typical Android OS home screen with widgets, you can install (via \"side loading\") a launcher (for example ADW.launcher EX is known to work well) that will create the typical home screen and allow widgets.Amazon Products & Services:The Kindle Fire OS was clearly designed to be integrated with all of Amazon's digital content. Any books, magazines, music, videos, or applications that you have purchased are available to you from the cloud and synced or streamed to your device seamlessly.  The built in applications for reading books or magazines, listening to music, and watching video work very well and are easy to use.If you have an Amazon Prime account there are thousands of TV shows and movies to watch for free and books that you can borrow for free each month.  Any music you have bought from the Amazon's MP3 music store will appear on your device automatically. Any music you have bought through other services can be uploaded to your Cloud Drive and will then be playable from the Kindle Fire.  You get 5Gb of free storage space (the things you buy from Amazon do not count towards your 5Gb limit).  You can pay to get a larger cloud drive if necessary (20Gb is only $20/year) - if you go to any paid version of the cloud drive you get unlimited music storage (i.e. none of your music counts against your storage limit).One thing that I was disappointed with is that non-music files in your cloud drive are not easily accessible.  Unlike music, which shows up immediately under the music tab in the OS, documents, pictures, videos, etc.that you have uploaded are not accessible except through the browser - no different than on your PC. I don't understand why the rest of the cloud drive is not integrated into the OS - perhaps it will be at some point, all it would take is a software update. There is a way to send documents via email to your Kindle Fire or through a new application that can be installed on your computer found here: www.amazon.com/sendtokindle/pc or www.amazon.com/sendtokindle/mac.Applications:Since the Amazon App Store was launched it has come a long way in catching up to the apps available in the Google Play market.  Now, almost all of the major apps are available in both locations.  The Kindle Fire's built in web browser and email application work quite well.  I enjoy the \"reading view\" mode in the browser - it reformats the website's text into a kindle like format for easier reading without all of the extraneous sidebars, ads, etc. Unfortunately there is no built in calendar application, although you can buy 3rd party applications, such as CalenGoo, that will work.One of the most disappointing things I have come across using the Kindle Fire is that even though most applications are available in the Amazon App Store, some of them are not available for the Kindle Fire. For example some of the apps I use: Dropbox, Business Calendar, WeatherBug Elite, and FlightTrack are not currently supported by the Kindle Fire.  I assume this may be due to the fact that the Kindle Fire does not have some of the services built into the stock Android OS such as location or Google calendar services, but I am not sure.  Some apps, such as Dropbox, are not supported by the Amazon App store for the Kindle Fire but actually work fine if they are \"side loaded\" but others will crash or not install if you attempt to install them outside of the Amazon App Store.  I imagine as time goes on this will improve as more app developers create Kindle Fire versions of their apps.Summary:If you already have an Amazon Prime membership or plan to get one, you cannot go wrong with this tablet.  It is an excellent, fast, well designed tablet for using Amazon services.  Most major Android apps are available and work great, but some applications are not supported by the Kindle Fire even though they are available to other devices in the Amazon App Store.", "Date": "June 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire vs Apple iPad", "Author": "Jeremy Petrillo", "ReviewID": "R19VK2PJXEM0TF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love the kindle fire!!

Once I received the item I was sooo excited to let the good times roll. Immediately, upon powering this unit on and getting familiar with the interface I was a bit depressed. The carousel was not something I would call intuitive AT ALL. This was a major deal-breaker for me.The reason? Well I bought two Kindle Fires for the same account (one for my wife and one for myself). I was immediately disappointed because there was no way to remove books, apps, internet WebPages, etc from the carousel. This was a HUGE problem because I read hard-core horror, and the wife reads twilight, and other novels that do not interest me. When I would show off this bad boy, people would say, \"Oh, you read twilight huh\"?Needless to say it was a bit of an embarrassment. Anyhow, they recently came out with a few updates that fixed this problem. Prior to this, I would have rated the Kindle fire on a two star basis, due to the lack of customization.Now onto the most recent review.....Since the release of the two updates, this unit has been stellar with a few caveats. I like the interface of this device. I am a simplistic person, and do not like clicking/touching several screens just to get a program/app to open. I favor the book shelf due to adding my favorite apps and books-stored in a convenient place for easy retrieval.The carousel is still okay. It is nice that I can remove and add items, but it really is a slight embarrassment. This isn't the case for most, as some I have read enjoy the carousel. Either way, it appears it's a preference whether or not you enjoy this feature.Next, I would like to cover what I feel is lacking for this device. First, if you have more than one device on your account, both devices will receive the exact same items you purchase and/or download. This is not a major deal-breaker seeing now you are able to remove these items from the device. Nonetheless, it is still irritating to have my wife say, \"Oh, I see you bought ANOTHER interesting book I would NEVER read again.\" Those of you who have been married for quite some time understand my dilemma...lolSecond, the lack of customization is a bit irritating. Unlike my Samsung Epic, I cannot download half the apps that I feel are useful. In other words, like my bank app to check my accounts, or make my car payments are NOT available (yes I know I can root this device, but I shouldn't have too). This is a bit perplexing which brings me to my third and final complaint.It appears Amazon wants you to buy this device so they can take control of you. They basically tell you what you can and cannot purchase. It would be nice if this was like any other android device where there really are no limitations of what apps you can and cannot download. For me, this is irritating.I know there are ways around this, and I am sure if I looked hard enough I can get the apps on the device that I want. But why go through all the trouble when Amazon clearly wants to control your device?Anyhow, all in all I love this device. For 200.00 you can beat this. I have never experienced problems with the Wi-Fi, nor the browser. In fact, the browser seems to work flawlessly on mine and my wife's unit. We have never lost a connection and have had only a few problems with apps that force-close. Amazons selection (aside from my complaints) are great. I enjoy Amazon instant video, the movies looks great. The speakers are okay, but I can hear them with no problem. Downloading items could not be any easier, and the book selection is superb.Even though I started with complaints, I feel this is a 4 star unit. This is in no way a comparison to the Ipad and I wish people would stop comparing it to Apples technology. This is an EREADER with a few perks. I am a hardcore reader and go through a book about every 5-6 days. This unit satisfies my craving, and the internet and apps are a bonus and a nice way to take a break from reading. I would recommend this product; after my babbling, 4 stars still stands.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Forget the iPad, get this!", "Author": "Robert Simione II \"Robert\"", "ReviewID": "R17839APJPTIQK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "On almost every measure, the Kindle Fire is just as good as the iPad, so when you consider the price, the iPad looks like a ridiculous purchase when you can get a Kindle Fire.

The 3G/4G connections sound nice until you look at the bill for that service. You would have to switch to one of the more expensive cell phone service providers, usually with a contract, and the 3G/4G service can easily cost 70-100 dollars a month.

Harford \"Student09\"", "ReviewID": "R2U6N2ER39W9LO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For anyone that wants to consume content - watch videos/TV shows, play games, check Facebook, read e-books, listen to music, etc. the Kindle Fire is the perfect addition to your life.  It's small and light enough to carry in your purse , yet the screen is big enough for you to truly enjoy e-books, videos, TV shows, and movies on.  Especially if you find yourself always or almost always within a wi-fi zone (home, work, etc.)  Having all of your stuff immediately available on this device ensures that you will never be bored again!  I keep mine in my bag and carry it with me everywhere so that I can whip it out and read a book, watch a show, play a game, do light internet browsing or shopping, etc.I'll echo what some of my fellow reviewers have already stated: The Kindle Fire is NOT iPad, nor is it meant to be.  It is an e-reader that also happens to have additional features, hence the apps, wi-fi, music, etc.  It has a bright screen with vibrant colors.  I'm able to comfortably read books both inside AND outside in direct sunlight by adjusting the screen brightness with no worries, strain or eye fatigue.The price point is just right for Kindle Fire.  I definitely recommend grabbing one.  Since I received mine, I've found myself not just playing games and watching TV shows, but actually reading more.  I've also found it very helpful for GRE prep.  It's much easier to carry around Kindle Fire and a small notebook for studying than it is to lug around a huge print book everywhere I go!If you get a Kindle, I recommend getting a screen protector and a case - you can grab these on Amazon no problem.  The protector will keep the screen from getting scratched/covered in fingerprints, and if you get a case that converts to a stand, you will be able to prob up Kindle in landscape, which is very helpful for watching videos.  I have CaseCrown Bold Standby Case (Blue) for Amazon Kindle Fire TabletAnyway, if you fit the profile I described above, don't hesitate to grab a Kindle Fire.  My husband and I waited a couple months before we got ours and now neither of us can figure out how we lived without Kindle!", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Detailed Review: I am very happy with my purchase.", "Author": "Kori", "ReviewID": "R3OI0HBLTN7MA3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have now owned my Kindle Fire for three months and feel that I can write a through review on the product.First I would like to state that the main purpose for purchasing the Kindle Fire was to be able to read e-textbooks on the device as well as watch TV shows or Movies during my down time at my University. The Fire has done everything that I have wanted it to do and I absolutely love it. Below, I will go into details about the things that stood out to me the most and things that I had questions about before buying my Fire.Size: I see the fire as being a 'baby' media tablet and for that, it is the perfect size. I do a lot of walking around campus and wanted to cut the weight of my book bag. Buying the Fire allowed me to switch all my books to e-textbooks. Now I really only carry the Fire (which is very light weight), a few notebooks, a pen, and on occasion my netbook. Having to walk such far distances across the campus, this has been an amazing lifesaver! The Fire is big enough without being too big for me to consider extremely portable.Watching TV/Movies: I have tested this feature out a lot and I have to say I have not had one complaint about the picture or the size of the video and I have a 63 inch TV at home. It's great for watching a show in between classes; which I do frequently. Having Amazon Prime (which I upgraded to after purchasing the Fire) has really come in handy and saved me a lot of money!Sound: With headphones (which is what I predominately use) the audio is great! I find that majority of the time, I barley have to have the volume above half. However when watching a TV Show or Movie, since the speakers are only at the top and you watch shows/movies in landscape format, all your audio comes from one side; this makes it sound a little weird. So if you're getting it to watch things without headphones, I would recommend getting some sort of external speakers.Games/Apps: I have been getting the daily free app from the amazon app store on my android phone for a while before buying the fire. I was pleased to know that those apps also work on the Fire. I downloaded and installed a few games and love how the graphics look. So far I have not had any trouble with apps freezing or shutting down or anything. I have been very pleased in that department. There is a small downside however, if the game you're playing uses the touch interface a lot, you will have a lot of fingerprints and smudges over the screen. For that, I recommend getting screen cloth as I find I use one often since touch the screen a lot.Comics: Reading comics on the fire is pretty awesome. There's a program called \"comics x\" which allow you to read the whole comic page, or read panel by panel using the swipe feature to get to the next panel. The downside is that some of the comics aren't always programed properly so sometimes it may go back one panel before moving on to the next; sometimes this can get frustrating.Books: I have never had a kindle before so I can comment as to how the reading is compared to others. But I did have one of the older Kobo readers. I find that I like reading on the Fire much better compared to that. In High School, I did a lot of reading on laptops so I am used to the screen. But if you have a hard time reading on the computer, I think you may find an issue reading on the Fire. My suggestion would be to find a best buy that carries one or a friend and try it out first.Textbooks: The biggest reason I purchased my Fire! So far, I have not bought a textbook through the amazon service; they don't carry the ones I need for my classes. But I have purchased my textbooks (and yes Pearson textbooks) through a website called coursesmart.com. They now have a non-downloadable Kindle Fire app so this helped me in making my decision; knowing that I could purchase and view my textbooks on the Fire. After having both hardcover textbooks and e-textbooks, I have to say that I really prefer having the e-textbooks. It's more affordable, lightweight, convenient for my lifestyle (I can read my e-textbook anywhere; including my cell phone), and eco-friendly! You're able to increase the font size and zoom in and even bring the diagrams and photos in the book to full screen. I thought the 7 inch screen would make reading textbooks difficult, but I haven't had any problems with it. Amazon really integrated the use of textbooks and their functions very well.(I also afforded my Fire, its case, and the protection plan by selling in all of my old textbooks to amazon!)The Cloud: I enjoy being able to stream my music straight from the cloud. It makes it really convenient instead of having to upload it from my computer. Also, songs that you buy through amazon will automatically be on there. A downside to the cloud is that pictures that you upload to the cloud are not visible on the Fire through an app or anything. You actually have to go through the web and go to the cloud. It's also important to know that you can't download the pictures from the cloud onto the Fire. If you try, it says that it is not supported... a little bit of a bummer.Internet: I haven't had any problems with the internet even though I have read some reviews stating that it was very slow. I have found that depending on your internet connection and what website you're view, you will rarely have a problem. Sites that seem to be visited a lot (ie. facbook) tend to load much quicker than ones that many Fire users probably don't visit. However, I haven't found it to be a problem and I am used to a hard wired cable internet connection at home.Other: The Fire does come with a wall plug for charging and I have found that even using it daily and keeping it on its 'sleep' mode, I don't have to charge all that often. I usually try to charge it at least once to twice a week however since I don't bring my charger to school and I don't want it dying on me there; it should be noted that while at school I usually watch between 6-8 hours on the Fire mostly streaming TV shows but occasionally reading my e-textbooks. It is also something to note that the cable needed to connect your Fire to your computer DOES NOT come with the Fire. Luckily I had one at home from my android phone, however this may be an extra expense you need to consider.Overall, I have been enjoying my Fire. Though its biggest downside is that it doesn't have the capabilities for me to add it to my cell network so it could have 3G or even 4G service; it only has wifi capabilities. When I first discovered that there were no 3G or 4G connection capabilities, I almost held off on purchasing the Fire. But I felt that its pros outweighed the cons that I would face with the connection issues. Usually most places now offer free wifi, however you will run into those that don't which honestly has made me a bit annoyed.Technically, I gave the Fire 4 1/2 stars. Only being able to connect where there's wifi, to me, is hindering on what should be a small media tablet. But for the price, if you can do without 3G/4G, then I would say its something that should be added to your technology collection. Sorry for such a long review, but I hope it was thorough enough and helped answer some of your questions before buying the Kindle Fire.UPDATE: I realize that I forgot to mention something important about the Kindle Fire.Screen: It hasn't come up for me very often, but the screen on the Fire has a lot of glare and can be a bit annoying to use out in direct sunlight or in a room where there is a light right above or behind you.Speakers: As I mostly use headphones with the Kindle Fire, this doesn't bother me, however the speakers can be very soft (especially when in a larger or non-silent room) even when turned up on both the system and with whatever your watching/listening to. However, if you have a good pair of headphones and don't mind wearing them (mine are from Creative) then it's not a bad flaw.", "Date": "March 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great electronic toy", "Author": "Chucky69", "ReviewID": "R3JMH9YVB7KIZD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After reading a few reviews where buyers had their Kindle Fires stolen and their credit cards charged up (because the Fires come with all your data pre-loaded), I went to Best Buy where I bought mine. I fiddled with the display model for about a minute and liked it enough to grab one. Unfortunately the darn \"protective\" cases are almost a quarter of what the Fire costs.But I've already loaded it with apps, videos, a few pictures, songs, and some books and it really is a fine big boy toy.Let me start with what I love about it:The price!Decent battery life.Outstanding display.Has a passcode lock feature.Decent browsing speed.Plenty of apps to choose from.The screen's keypad is better than my iPhone's (bigger if not better)Will probably take the place of my laptop on trips.Reading comics on it is awesome.Netflix and Amazon's Instant Video look great.Did I mention THE PRICE??Here's what I'm not so happy about:The touchscreen, probably depending more on the application than the screen itself, has (a couple of times) not wanted to honor touch. All I had to do was go back to the homescreen and then back into the app and things were good to go.Despite the larger keypad (when it appears), it's still not quite as great as I thought it would be. I still have to be careful what letters I touch. It does have the auto-complete word thing which helps a lot.Not as many apps as the iPhone/iPad but there's usually something out there that can compete with the Apple's version.I heard people complain about the scrolling speed but it gets better after you upgrade the software, which was a piece of cake to do. Even before the upgrade it wasn't all that bad.It's a little picky about what kind of user videos it plays but I haven't had too many problems with that. It plays Firefox's converted videos (off of YouTube) just fine. They're in MP4 format.The audio isn't as powerful as my laptop or iPhone but it is definitely loud enough. I use Skull Candy earbuds and maxing it out would be a little uncomfortable for me. (UPDATE 3/7/12: I don't know what happened before but I was listening to the audio in an office setting and it is outstanding.)BOTTOM LINE:Very happy with the purchase. As soon as the Kindle Fire 2 comes out (hopefully with 3G) and maybe a tad bigger screen, I'll give this one to my daughter and buy the new one.

I am sure there are more apps that I could install, but so far everything that I want or think I need has been available--including Angry Birds. There are still features I haven't used, such as the Cloud, but as time goes on I expect the Fire will handle them seemlessly. The only thing I find even a bit disappointing is a rather narrow selection of free media on Prime. The hype with Prime was there were thousands of free video and text available.

Having said that, I think the KF is a nice piece of hardware for those of us who live and breath Amazon and have a Prime membership.

I have access to Facebook, games, movies both on Amazon and Netflix, and my music in a package that easily slips into my robe or my back pocket when I'm wearing my jeans. Of course, it is slower than my iPad and there's no GPS or camera. But that's what I have my iPad for. The KF is perfect for web surfing in bed or on the couch. If fits perfectly in one hand. Amazon needs to release more updates to help with smoothing out the browser. But for those who want to speed it up, you can do so by TURNING OFF the Silk Browser Acceleration feature and choosing \"ON DEMAND\" for plug ins. Pages seem to load 10 to 20% faster. Anandtech recently confirmed the slower load times on his site with the Silk Browser enabled.PROS:1) 7 inch size fits in palm and larger pant pockets2) Very nice IPS Display with very good contrast3) Great $199 entry level pricing4) Nice Amazon Eco-System Integration for shopping, books, movies, music and apps5) Decent battery life at about 6 hours6) Nice build qualityCONS:1) 512 MB RAM is too little and will slow apps down at times2) 8 GB strorage a bit thin even considering cloud storage3) Browser is slow with default setting (See above to change 2 settings to speed things up.)4) A little bit on the heavy side vs. the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7+ for example5) Power button misplacementAll things considered, you are getting the KF slightly below cost and you get 80% of the function of any of the $500 full featured tablets.

We were looking at the Samsung tablets but they are really expensive & we feel that for her use, the Kindle is everything she needed & more!  We could not be happier with the Kindle Fire.Kindle Fire Leather Cover by Marware, Black  (the case comes in 5 colors)", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Lightin it up with the Kindle Fire", "Author": "Grady Anderson", "ReviewID": "R2V1Q8QWAP23RL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off, let me just say that I love my Kindle Fire. I got it for Christmas, and the moment i got it out of the box, I was hooked. I highly recommend one of these to anybody looking for the features that they would normally use on any other tablet.To answer the first question, no, this is not meant to tear down the iPad's market. At the same time, I wouldn't say that this isn't a strong competitor to the iPad. For most people, an iPad has so many features that people don't even need, let alone want. I know for a fact that the Kindle can do everything I would want from an iPad, and perform it all at basically the same level. I browse the internet, play some games, read a book, maybe check my email, and then im done, not using a whole bunch of fancy gadgets for $500. The iPad may have a bigger app store, but i would expect that with growing popularity of the Kindle, it will start receiving some attention on the marketplace and have quite a selection of it's own.Now for the features of the Fire itself. First off, it has a 7\" screen which has spectacular colors. Out of the box, it is very simple, it comes with a little slide out cardboard handout with some simple instructions, the power cable, and the kindle, and your ready to go. Pretty simple setup. As for the problem people have been having with the power button, I cannot relate to them because honestly it hasn't gotten in my way at all. For people with bigger hands though, I could understand this being a minor setback. When on the fire, no matter what application you're in or what song your listening to, there is always a little setting toolbar at the top of the screen where you can locate volume, brightness, etc. It is kind of hard navigating to, but since it's part of the software, there may be an update to put some of this in a more manageable location. Also with the power button at the bottom is the micro USB slot where you connect your kindle to the charger, and the headphone jack. Besides the power button, there are no other physical buttons located on the Fire.Shopping on the kindle is a breeze. Right out of the box, the kindle comes with an amazon shopping app which is really handy. Some people complain that if somebody were to get a hold of the Kindle, your credit card can be charged because of the 1 click shopping on there. I believe there is a way to set a code so that you have to type in a password each time you buy something. For those who are concerned, here's my advice to you:1.) Set a passcode for you kindle to access it, if somebody does get a hold of it, they're going to have to sit and play with a passcode for a long time.2.) Set the passcode for the one click shopping.3.) The most simple one of all would be, don't lose your kindle and take good care of your $200 piece of equipment.The Kindle Fire also comes with a free month of Amazon prime membership. Be sure to use this a lot, so that you can get a good idea of whether or not you make the decision to buy it later. For me I did not, because the Fire has a netflix app with streaming, and I just so happen to have netflix.Other than that, I'm not going to write an hour long review about the features of the device. My advice to you if your edgy on whether to get one or not is to go try one out at Best Buy. Take my word for it, you won't be disappointed.Also, remember, since the Fire is so cheap, (Amazon actually loses money when they manufacture them) remember that a lot of movies you might have downloaded will NOT work with the Fire. It is purposely set up this way. The Fire is an AMAZON consumption device, so if you are buying one to add all your movies to or books from another marketplace, you will be severely disappointed. ONLY buy this product if you are new to the tablet market, and are willing to buy from amazon.That's just my review on the Fire. There's thousands more out there and you can form your own opinion from them. One thing to remember from negative reviews on the Fire though is that a lot of old issues have been solved due to firmware updates. A lot of issues people had when they first bought the fire are resolved. Now go out and buy your kindle!*NOTE: IF YOU ORDER THE KINDLE FROM AMAZON.COM, YOUR KINDLE WILL ARRIVE IN THE BOX PRE-REGISTERED TO YOUR AMAZON.COM ACCOUNT. IT WILL HAVE YOUR CREDIT CARD AND ALL INFORMATION ON YOUR KINDLE WHILE IT IS SHIPPING.

And anything I don't know, the owner's manual is already downloaded on the device for you.  My friend bought me an Amazon gift card, which I loaded to my account.  So I've been buying things with my device and my gift card is automatically being used until it runs out, instead of my credit card being charged.  I LOVE that it knows to use my gift card without me having to prompt it each time I make a purchase.I purchased 2 books before I figured out how to check out free books from the library.  I'm also loving the Prime trial membership.  I've downloaded about 3 shows.  I will definitely become a member of Amazon Prime.Even though its very easy to make purchases, I also like how you can immediately cancel an order without ever being charged.I honestly thought that by it not being a 3G device, not accessing the internet would be a hassle for me but it isn't.  Because I don't have Wifi where I work, I simply download what I can at home as far as books or movies to the device, and that way, when I bring it to work, I can do what I want without needing a Wifi connection.", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Can not use in all United States areas", "Author": "Susan Book", "ReviewID": "RYUAWSRR2XLEX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We have loved our Kindle for the past two years.

To be honest, my pre-purchase motivation was that this tablet was $500 less than a loaded IPad 2 and I just didn't feel the larger screen, camera and memory slot were worth the $500.  Crossing my fingers, I went to my local Staples and bought myself the Fire.I've barely set it down since then.  When streaming video, the image is crisp and clear, frankly it's better than on my admittedly aged television.  I've had no connectivity issues at all with the Fire.  I've also not had any issues with the placement of the power button, but that might be because I have mine in a case that leaves that button recessed.My wish for the next generation Fire is an external audio control and a memory slot and 3G or 4G, so I can use it when I am not near a WiFi.  I'm sure more and more apps will be added.  For the money, the Fire simply cannot be beat.  Easy to use, reliable, fits right in my purse.

After playing with it for a day I've kind of concluded that if I were just reading books, I would prefer my earlier Kindle (a Kindle keyboard). It's easier on the eyes, readable in bright light, stays charged longer, has a night light for reading in bed (built into the cover), but it sure isn't as pretty as the new one. I've kind of concluded that for magazine subscriptions, the Fire would be much preferred. It's really good for something like National Geographic where the pictures are such an important part of the content. Also, with Prime, there's a pretty good selection of videos available for free, including some excellent older movies and a variety of TV shows and series. The video quality seems really good but you need high speed Wi-Fi if you really want it to work well. Fortunately, we got that when we installed Comcast last summer. The Fire should also handle internet videos like U-Tube pretty well, although I haven't tried that. I also haven't tried the Amazon lending library or member to member loans.Surfing on the Fire seems pretty quick and the included browser has worked well so far. The only problem is that a 'busy' web page on the seven inch screen is sometimes virtually unreadable, at least for my aging eyes. I think there's a way to zoom effectively to areas of particular interest but haven't really played with that much yet either. Turning the Fire on it's side and scrolling in landscape mode helps considerably.All in all, I\"m happy with it, though I still have a lot to learn. I have both Kindles registered to the same account and will probably use both quite a lot. I might even loan the older one to my girlfriend if I find a book for it that she would particularly like. I think I'll probably also keep the Prime membership. It should save close to half its price just in shipping costs so that will mean the other things only cost about five bucks a month. That's about a third of what my Netflix membership costs, so it seems a good deal to me.I would strongly recommend buying a case for your Fire since it comes with virtually no protection for the screen, although I've read that it's pretty scratch resistant.

Most of my music is not purchased on iTunes, so I had no trouble with this at all.

So recently, I started looking at the Android tablets and really liked the Kindle Fire.  I just wanted this to surf the web, watch Netflix, etc. at home when my family was using the computer.So I ordered it from Amazon and then started reading some negative reviews.  \"Uh-oh,\" I thought.  Had I made the wrong decision?  I had researched the Fire and another tablet I was interested in and decided on the Fire.I got the Fire the other day and from the moment I turned it on, I loved it!  Wireless setup was a piece of cake!  Found my wireless instantly, put in my password and it was up and running.  Automatically prompted me to download apps I had already downloaded for my phone from the Amazon Appstore, so that was nice.I liked the size of the Fire when I tested it at the store.  I had tried a 10\" and, surprisingly, I felt it was too big.  The touch screen works great.  A few times I had to touch something twice, but I have long fingernails so I'm not sure if my finger just hadn't made contact.  I have the same problem with my phone.I realized a lot of the negative reviews were issues that I didn't care about.  \"There's no app for Gmail\" - just set up your Gmail with the e-mail app.  Looks the same as my Android phone. \"There's no app for You Tube\" - I really don't care about You Tube, but the Fire came with You Tube bookmarked on the browser, so I tested it and it worked fine.  Everyone has become so dependent on these \"apps\" - guess what you have a web browser and an internet connection, look it up the \"old-fashioned way\" LOL.  \"There's no 3G connection\" - don't care, I just want to use it at home anyway with my wireless.  I have an Android phone if I want to look up something on the go.  \"There's no USB cable to connect it to my computer\" - well I didn't read in the specs that said it was included.I never had a previous Kindle, I am more of an audiobook person, but I realized this would be great for my daughter, as she has to read 20 minutes a night for school and she has almost has gone through her library of books.  She has also taken a liking to the Fire, so it looks like I will be sharing it with her...Overall, I am very happy with my purchase.  For me, it is great.  I did research it and my advice to anybody would be to go to a retailer and try it out along with some other tablets to make your decision.  Yes, it is tied into Amazon, but what would you expect with a product MADE by Amazon?  I like Amazon, so it was a plus for me.", "Date": "December 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent Product", "Author": "Kate Fredericks \"Kate\"", "ReviewID": "R1QXSWAEFQJQ5L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I waited until I had my Kindle Fire for two weeks, using it frequently before reviewing it for Amazon.com. I can say, with full certainty that I LOVE LOVE LOVE the Kindle Fire. I'll talk about the good things first. When I first signed on, much to my surprise, ALL of the books from my regular Kindle were sitting on the bookshelf, waiting to be opened! I love the shelf set up, all apps, books, magazines, newspapers, on-demand movie stores (such as Netflix, or Amazon's own store), are filed on the top shelf. You need only to flip through them to get to what you want. So easy, a 5-yr-old could manage it. If you have apps or watch a lot of movies, or are reading a particular book, that you want singled out, you just move them down to the lower selves and store them - much easier to get to them because you WILL start filling up that file quickly. I like the fact that the storage is in the Cloud, rather than on the device, which saves a lot of memory. I signed up for Netflix, got the one month free, expecting to dislike the smaller screen, being used to big flat screens. Not so. At night, when my husband is sleeping, I just put it up on my chest, plug in my earphones and can either watch a movie or one of the many television shows available. The picture was crystal clear and up close, it didn't both me at all. I got it with one month free Prime, which was nice because right now, I'm doing a lot of Christmas shopping and I can go in and buy single items an pay no shipping and get the product in 2 - 5 days (they say 2 - 3, but it took one of my products 5 business days). If you already own an Android phone, you will be proficient with the Kindle Fire in a half hour. The colors are just spectacular, whether reading a magazine, or watching Netflix. I am very impressed with the sharpness of the colors. It MIGHT spoil you from using your regular Kindle because you get very used to simply touching the screen to do everything. My husband is having an issue with that, which, of course, I laughed at. I thought I would want the bigger Ipad at $500 because I figured a 7 inch screen would not make me happy. Not so. I find that at 14 ounces, and being small enough to slip into my purse or pocket is VERY convenient and screen size has not been an issue with me at all. The screen is VERY touchy - which I put in the positive category, because once you get used to it, and you will, you will like having a quickly reactive touch screen. In the beginning, it might cause you some issues, but as I said you WILL get used to it and be glad to have it as sensitive as it is.Now for the cons, which I hope they fix (they say they are planning to) in the upcoming months. I have found that loading my books and movies are a little slow, because it's pulling it from the Cloud. For most people, including me, there's no particular hurry, but I just thought I'd mention it. The screen is very shiny - not like my regular Kindle I bought 6 months ago, so if you plan on reading out in the sun, I'd take the regular Kindle rather than the Fire. However, they have sort of fixed this problem by allowing you to set the lighting from low to high. You'll need HIGH lighting to read in the sun - so it's not impossible, just not as good. If you plan on doing a lot of reading and watching movies, I highly suggest you get one of the covers that adjusts the Fire so it can sit up at various angles. My husband bought one for $4.00, which used velcro and could be adjusted to many places. I got a more expensive (but purple) cover, which only gives me one position. I will be buying the $4.00 cover - which I can do now and not pay any shipping :-). You WILL want to get a cover for your fire, because the screen is easily smeared and also, you will need a stylus or else buy a big box of electronic cleaner. I wish the battery life was longer on the Fire - The Nook claims a battery life of 10 or so hours. The Fire is 8 hours (in total usage). So be sure, if you go on long trips, to keep that battery charger handy. And if you are on a road trip, a car charger is a must. My car has a plug in - so I can just bring my regular charger and, well, plug it in. This should be a standard on ALL cars in the future, but I digress. Some people have reported freezing problems, neither my husband nor I have had one moment's worth of problems with our Fires. Also, I find I cannot cut and paste or \"share\" in the Facebook app - but I think that's an issue with the Android app and Facebook and not the Fire. However, it DOES limit me, because I do a lot of sharing when I am on Facebook. The app is terrible - and they (Android and FB) need to get together and make it much more versatile!!!! There is also no 3G or 4G connectibility with the Fire (or Nook), you need WIRELESS internet to download your things, but if you just do that before you leave (download whatever it is you want to do), you should be OK. We don't have 3 or 4G availability where we live, so it's not an issue for us. Also, I don't remember the memory space available, but the Nook's is quite a bit more. However, the Fire, using the Cloud, I think cancels that problem out.So, which device is best? I can't remember which day, but USAToday had a Fire vs. Nook 2-page article recently which I read. The author used both and rated them. According to him, the Fire edged out the Nook for a variety of reasons. Evidently, there are now 6,000 Android apps available (although the Fire can only access a fraction of these which is also supposed to be fixed in the next few months), whereas the Nook only has 1,000 apps available. According to this author, Android should have 10,000 apps available soon, and so, he feels the Fire will be a better tablet to invest in for this reason alone. Also, the Kindle is $50 cheaper - another very nice feature! Oh, and just FYI to Amazon - I sold two Kindles to my Cell Phone representative yesterday - do I get a commission? Can't hurt to ask.Ultimately, I have to say that I am totally infatuated with my Kindle and it goes everywhere with me.

NO !!* It's hard to read in the sun (Umm, it tells you its NOT e-ink)  THE ONE STAR REVIEWS ARE QUITE FUNNY....

Thought there was an issue with passwords but looks like you can set one.========We've had the Fire a few days now which is long enough to give you our first impressions.  First what its not. It's not an iPad so don't buy it thinking it will be. It's not 3g so be prepared to find wireless wherever you go.Now for what it is. It's a great little entertainment device.  You can read materials, watch movies and surf the web. You can also email and read documents.  It's also $200 which we whittled down to $20 when we bought it using our Amazon card points so we think it's a great bargain.It's a good size and display is very clear.  The touchscreen is very responsive and it's fast.  I've been particularly surprised at how fast it is.  Web surfing is easy and we love the way you can enlarge the text/pictures on screen.  We've seen that before but we never had a device that would do it. Most web sites load immediately.Downloads are relatively quick and glitch free.  Setup was super easy.  The device practically registered itself. It's also easy to transfer.  We bought it for someone else.  When we got ready to switch it over, we just unregistered it from me and registered it to the other person.  So simple.Sound is decent.  We wish it had volume button but we can live with the onscreen volume control.  You definitely need a cover for it.Since we weren't looking for all the extras (Bluetooth, GPS, Webcam) this works just fine for us.  We can facebook,surf, download music and other entertainment on this handy device that only cost us $20.  Very satisfying. Like one reviewer said, Amazon looked at what many people really use these tablets for and built it fit that spot.

Wells", "ReviewID": "R18VXBC0PNY08B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "**Please Note** This review is being written on the Kindle Fire.I was looking for 3 things from the Kindle fire - the ability to read books, watch movies and utilize apps on one device - especially on long trips.  This device does all three perfectly thus far.  I also now have the ability to surf the web with a wireless connection (which is superior to 3G if you own up to date equipment).  I have skimmed several negative reviews and wanted to address some of the fallacy contained in them, while also noting some slight supporting software problems that will hopefully be addressed in future app releases.WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY:  There is nothing wrong with the kindle's wireless connectivity.  If you are having problems connecting I bet you you are running a 'B' band router in your home.  You probably got this router free from your cable provider.  There are 3 different types of band routers 'B', 'G',  and 'N'.  Running a 'B' router is the technological equivalent to running a beta Max machine on your TV.  It is old technology that is not produced anymore.  I would upgrade to a 'N' Band router because lets face it - technology gets old fast- so you should always buy the best available.  I purchased an cisco-Linksys 2000n series last year and it improved the wireless connectivity in my home immensely.  The newer version of the one I purchased is the linksys 2500N according to Amazon.com.DELETING THINGS FROM YOUR KINDLE: If you are a previous kindle user you already know this but if want to delete a download permanently from your kindle, you need to delete it from your kindle library on amazon.com.  Then it will be deleted off all your devices ie your phone with your amazon app, your computer, etc.  Although it is an extra step, this allows you to cross share withe different devices.  If also provides you with a backup and allows you to retain materials that you want to keep but you don't want sitting on your device taking up room. Could it hurt if the fire had a more customizable home screen?  No certainly not. However, the setup is consistant with the previous kindle models so I won't downgrade it for that.SOFTWARE GLITCHES OF NOTE:  I have the amazon app on my android phone and it seems to work better on the phone.  There doesn't appear to be any definative way to to toggle the menu screen on the Fire. I had to click around to get it to come up - not sure how I did it.Also, this is a complaint about the Android keyboard - stop forcing your auto complete on me!  By all means suggest a correction -  but quit doing it for me automatically.

I watched a little Netflix and was very impressed. I played with my Mother's new Ipad this weekend and the picture quality was marginally better on the Ipad but I prefer the Fire on absolutely every other level. When you compare price the Fire is hands down winner. When you compare book selection, music selection and price of content the Fire wins without even competition for the Apple store.

Messinger", "ReviewID": "R1I38OBM7OUC76", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "--Update 1/4/2012----------------------------After using the Kindle Fire for several weeks now and after the first Update I have to say the device speed has improved and the touchscreen seems to be more responsive.  I've also gotten used to the keyboard and my missed presses has dropped.  I'd bump the scroe to a 3.5 given the new software update and maybe even 4 after the next promised update that is meant to adress more issues.---------------------------------------------I've been using the Kindle Fire pretty consistently for a week.  Here is a brief summary of what's good and what's bad with the device.THE BAD-Touch screen accuracy / responsivenessBeing used to the iphone and having tried my gf's ipad the Kindle Fire really doesn't have the touch screen down yet.  I find myself constantly hitting the wrong letters on the keyboard and trying to move forward the time in a youtube video is almost impossible.The lack of a physical home button causes all sorts of frustration.  The worst example is when reading an e-book.  If you want to bring up the home button you have to press and hold for a perfect amount of time.  If you hold too long it thinks you're trying to highlight a word.  If you don't hold long enough the home screen doesnt' come up.  If you move your finger ever so slightly by accident it thinks you're trying to turn the page.  It can take me 3-4 attempts to press and hold in just the right way to bring up the home button.  Very frustrating!-Brightness SettingsThe kindle fire doesn't seem to automatically adjust brightness based on your current lighting situation like the iphone or ipad does.  Worse yet when I'm using it at nighttime it's VERY bright.  I've turned down the brightness to the lowest settings and even at that setting it's far too bright.  I hope they fix this with a software patch soon.-SpeedGiven it's a dual core cpu I'm a bit surprised at how sluggish the device can feel.  Running websites with flash can really bring the fire to a halt.-WeightThe size is just right but I'm a bit surprised at how heavy it feels.THE GOOD-Price-Custom UI interface-Integration with Amazon-The CloudIt's so great to upload all the songs from all of my MP3's to amazon's could and then have access to them all on my fire.-AndroidI love not having to deal with Itunes.  Being able to connect my device to a pc and simply drag and drop files is very nice.In summary I feel like for $199 the fire is a no brainer for someone wanting a tablet.  However since this is Amazon's firs go at a tablet and considering all of the negatives i've encountered I'm still considering returning it and waiting for the second version.  Amazon didn't really nail the kindle until the kindle keyboard in my opinion so I hope they get out an improved version of the fire in a year or so.", "Date": "November 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great First Impression", "Author": "MsKishaRenee", "ReviewID": "R3ATZ3Y7WYDME7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My Kindle Fire was delivered over the weekend and I really love it. I think it's just a really fun, simple, sleek, and cool device! This is my first tablet-like experience and I am really impressed. I still love my laptop and I thought the iPad was too expensive so when I heard Amazon was introducing the Kindle Fire, I thought this would be a perfect way to introduce me to the world of touchscreens. I don't need a lot of bells and whistles at this point so this device provides everything I need. I think it's a great device for entertainment. The setup was fast and simple. Once the setup was complete, it loaded with all of my books which I purchased on Amazon via my Kindle 3. My music was also there that I've stored on the cloud. Basically, the device comes loaded with Amazon content that you've previously purchased. The apps are cool...they have a large selection of useful and fun free apps. Web browsing is fast...I quickly loaded all of my favorite sites. Only one local news site loads a little differently than I expected and I haven't been able to watch a youtube video yet but I've successfully watched other videos. I watched one of my favorite episodes online with impressive clarity and sound and I also watched a video from a blog site. It's a little heavier than my Kindle 3 and I'd like to get a screen protector to deal with the fingerprints! I think the Kindle 3 or previous Kindles are better for reading since they have a longer battery life and a display that is suited especially for reading. The Kindle Fire is highly portable. The touch screen is very responsive and typing is easy. You can charge it while in use but it's easy just to charge it while you're asleep.

It still fits in my jacket pocket, though I have taken to carrying it in my back blue jean pocket as the weather has been warm here lately, and like my previous Kindle, this one goes with me everywhere. I have also owned both an iPad and a 10.1 Galaxy Tab for application development, but I never took to carrying them in my day-to-day due to their size.If Amazon takes some time to polish the software a little more, it would really improve the experience, but at $200 I find that I'm quick to forgive the idiosyncrasies.

The recent upgrade to the operating system has fixed many of the touch screen issues and I have had few problems with connectivity through my home WiFi or through hot spots away from home. My home router is not new, it is only 802.11g. Most new routers are 802.11n and most complaints seem to be with connecting to routers with this new standard.REVIEW UPDATE 12/11/2011: I've had the Fire for a little over three weeks now and I have downgraded it from five stars to three.  My two biggest complaints are with the WiFi and with the touchscreen. The battery life could be better but so far it has been less of an annoyance than the first two.I had no trouble setting up the WiFi when I first received the Fire. It easily recognized my WiFi modem and the many other hotspots available in and around my apartment building. The problem is that unless I am within a few feet of my router the Fire cannot get/maintain a strong enough signal to stay connected. I would attribute this to the multiple other competing nearby hotspots, and the thick walls and large rooms of my apartment, however I own other WiFi enabled devices (Blackberry Bold, Logitech Squeezebox) that do not share the Fire's connectivity problem. Both my Blackberry and Squeezebox are able to receive and hold my WiFi signal in distant rooms that the Fire cannot. Also, the Fire's WiFi signal strength seems to be strongest when the device is held vertically with the speakers at the top. Holding the Fire horizontally often causes the signal to be dropped.The touchscreen is schizophrenic. Sometimes it works perfectly. Sometimes it doesn't work at all. The icons on the home screen may need to be tapped repeatedly in order to open an app.The adjustment for brightness may or may not slide easily from left to right. Re-opening the Wireless Networking menu to re-set the dropped WiFi signal may take one tap or eight. It can be maddening.I understand a major software update is forthcoming from Amazon within the next two weeks. It remains to be seen if these problems can be resolved through software or if the device hardware is the problem.ORIGINAL REVIEW 11/16/2011: I've had the Fire for about 24 hours now and no, it's not perfect, but it's plenty good.1) The set up is fast, straight forward and intuitive. I still haven't had to refer to the instruction guide.2) There are a zillion apps to download, many of them free.3) The touch screen works better with some apps than others. Ditto the keyboard.4) Some apps take practically no time to install, others (Conde Nast magazines in particular)take longer than forever.5) The keyboard, though small, is responsive, and I have been able to type fairly quickly and without too many mistakes. I haven't had to resort to loud cursing or gnashing of my teeth while typing.Some negatives:1) It would have been nice to have 3G in addition to the WiFi! Hope you're listening Amazon!2) This morning the device ran completely out of juice about 5 minutes after the battery meter showed that it had 1/4 of its reserves left. I am hoping that this is because I hadn't charged the Fire sufficiently when I first received it.3) The screen view should move easily from vertical to horizontal as you tilt the device. Sometimes this does not work at all (New Yorker Magazine). Also there was a short-lived episode where the screen revolved almost crazily, completely counter to the way I was moving the Fire. I was installing an app when this happened. It hasn't happened since.4) I find the Fire quite heavy in my hand.5) Reading is not as pleasant as on the non-color screen Kindle, however the screen can be adjusted for brightness.If the only thing you want to do with a Kindle is read books, stick with the non-color screen Kindle. If you want a device that has internet access, email access, runs a multitude of apps, plays music and video and only costs $199, the Fire is a great choice.", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wow", "Author": "G. M. Matthews", "ReviewID": "R23YO0092TUMFZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got it today. Had it up and running in about 15 minutes. It came fully charged. It knew who I was (guess that's a Kindle thing). The screen is great. The size is great. It's a bit heavy. It's very easy to hold as it's covered except for the screen in rubber, which was a very smart move IMO. Movies look great. There are lots of apps (not everything I use - SugarSync, hear me?). It's easy enough to use my mom can figure it out (she'll likely get one for Christmas). The Web browsing with the cloud enabled is snappy, not quite a computer with a full caching browser, but sooooooo much better than an iPhone (which I also have). Rotation is instant. Sound is quite good and has a very stereo sound so there is likely some sound enhancement going on. Volume is not great, though, but the speakers are small, just like an iPhone. Loud enough for personal use, but not enough to fill any room. Headphones will likely fix that.For reading a book, the size is much better than an iPad, which is too big for holding for long periods. This is much better. Still a bit too heavy, but the size is a good compromise. I have been reading Kindle books on my iPhone, and will likely now use the Kindle Fire almost all the time. It's just the right size. Battery life we will see. Been using it constantly for 3 hours, and battery is down to about 45%, but for much of that time I had the brightness at default, which is actually a lot too much for indoor use.Web pages are a bit smaller than optimal, but multitouch responds instantly. It doesn't focus in on a column you tap in a Web page as an iDevice would, but simply zooms where you tap and you might then have to recenter on waht you want. But it's quick, and I had no trouble getting a view that was great. Rotation and Web pages look much better, but the title and menu bars take up too much room, and haven't found how to turn them off if that's possible. If you could see the full screen, it would be fine.Of-axis viewing on the screen seems very good. Colors are very good. Brightness is more than I want on max, but I won't use it outside much so YMMV.Truly overall, it's a great device. Even if there were no more apps (not likely), I'd be happy with the purchase. At least Evernote is there (I use that ALL the time now). Very good compromise for usability/size/cost. Amazon will likely sell a zillion of these, and rightly so.I'm amazon centric, living out in the stick and liking the part about UPS bringing anything I want to my door. And being that, am already a Prime member so can use those services on the Fire which really will add.Minuses will of course be what if I don't have an Internet connection, what happens when I fill it up and want more space. But for the price, it's good. Now, if there were a microSD slot, that would be truly wonderful.

But this KINDLE FIRE has been put together in a way that ALL ages can participate, and while there is still much for us to learn; the rewards are immediate. The visuals are clear, the games are fun and we used the older Kindles to read, and this FIRE makes reading even easier, and more fun with the color graphics as well. Now, my only problem is getting him AWAY from the Kindle Fire, so he will do some of his daily chores!

After I connected to WiFi, it immediately downloaded the latest software update, so I didn't have any of the negative experiences that earlier users had.Pros:*Sharp screen - videos play very nicely and the speakers are surprisingly good. I had expected the small speakers to be tinny, but they are not.*Free month of Prime - I've already watched part of the first episode of Downton Abbey and was very impressed by the quick load time and playback*Websites load very quickly and pages turn quickly - I know this had been an issue prior to the update, but it is not an issue after the update*Apps - Lots of great apps for free or minimal price, especially silly time wasting and addictive games. I might be regretting that I downloaded Fruit Ninja as I'll never get work done again*Size - the size is perfect. I thought I might have been more interested in a larger screen, but this one is perfect and easy to hold.*Books - it's great to see my library with covers and be able to pull items from the cloud as I would like to read them. I didn't like the white background/black text for reading and turned it to tan/black text and now it's perfect. Very easy on the eyes.*Music - I didn't think I would use this device for music, but it's great to be able to pull items from the Cloud. I will probably be listening to music through the Kindle after all.  And again, the speakers are surprisingly good.*TV/Movies - I have a few movies/tv shows in my cloud and had no trouble clicking and watching them instantly on my FireSome folks have complained that they bump the power switch on the bottom, but  I have not experienced this problem.  Other reviewers have suggested flipping it upside down if this does happen (power on the top), so I have no worries.There are a few cons but they seem very manageable.Cons:*Weight - I was surprised by the heft compared to my e-ink Kindle (2nd generation).  However, I have a case with a stand and use it to prop the Fire while I read.*Shiny Screen - The glossy screen is very impressive looking, however, in the florescent lights of my work, the reflection on the screen was a bit annoying.  I'm not sure if there is anything that can be done and I assume all tablets have this issue.  It's obvious that the Fire will be terrible for pool side reading, but that's why I have my e-ink display.I've had my Fire for 2 days now and am really enjoying it.

The smaller size makes this a great portable device.  Performace, especially with videos, is awesome.  Book reading is better than I thought it would be, but I still prefer e-ink for extended reading (just my personal preference).  I have tried several magazines and find those to be very enjoyable and readable on the fire.  The web browser is very functional, although some pages obviously will look better on a larger screen.

I did so for a variety of reasons.But first, let me talk about why I bought the Fire in the first place.I'd been looking for a 7\" tablet for some time now. I feel that the iPad is too big, too heavy, and too expensive, $499 for the base Wi-Fi only model. I read a lot of books and use the traditional Kindle 3G. I had hoped the Kindle Fire (yes I know it's not e-ink) would have been an adequate reading experience on the LCD and an adequate tablet experience (though limited by no Bluetooth; no camera/mic for Skype) so I could use one device for reading and web stuff. I thought the size, the promised capabilities, and the $199 price were a winning combination.At first, it was.Setting up the Kindle Fire was very easy--except for connecting to my Wi-Fi, which was easily fixed by restarting my home router. Using the built in email app to tap into my Gmail and my contacts worked seamlessly, though I found it odd that a calendar app was not native to the device as well. I was unable to use Exchange to get my work email because my company only supports BlackBerry, iPhone, and iPad. Something I could live with.The Fire app selection is limited but fine as I'm not a big gamer and just love to play Scrabble with friends. My 6-year-old daughter loves \"Cut the Rope\" and \"Angry Birds\"--both available as well. I was also pleasantly surprised that Amazon allowed a Netflix app, which of course competes with the streaming movies and TV shows from Amazon Prime.But unfortunately, streaming video was where my real problem started.I noticed a popping noise on the headphones and the speakers during streaming from Netflix, Amazon Prime, and YouTube. To its credit, Amazon customer service was extremely accommodating. When all the attempted fixes didn't work, Amazon sent me another Fire.The replacement Fire didn't have the popping sound on the audio and I was happy--figuring as an early adopter there are bugs and I'd just gotten a clunker.Unfortunately, I discovered that the on/off switch didn't turn the Fire back on after prolonged non-use. I had to hold the switch for 20 seconds--basically hard restarting everytime I wanted to turn the device back on. Again, to its credit Amazon tried to work with me on some fixes. When they didn't work, Amazon sent me a second replacement.When I got the second replacement, the on/off switch worked, but this second replacement device experienced the same popping audio problem during streaming video as the first one did.So I figured three strikes and you're out.I returned the device, the case I bought, and was refunded my app purchases.This experience won't turn me off to Amazon. I like reading on my Kindle 3G--and despite some the complaints around the web, I find the books to be reasonably priced. I also appreciated Amazon's flexibility and their final solution of a full refund. I truely hope Amazon can fix the issues with the Kindle Fire. Maybe the new software update in a couple weeks will do the trick.

For not so tech savvy people I would say they will be happy with the product, but for people that like technology I feel they will be let down in more then one way.  To name a few things I was disappointed in.1. The touch screen ability seems off, I read several reviews myself about people having to hit certain items twice or even more to get it to recognize, for me it took on average three times hitting the home button for it to do something.2. Web Browsing at most was mediocre, it took some time to load a page and the quality of the image just seem blurred.  Almost like when someone is trying to increase the size of the picture and the image becomes blurry.  My iPhone looks completely better and it's only 3.5 inches.3.  Apps, since I have an iPhone this can be biased but the Kindle is based off the Android system and there is simply no apps of any great venture, and the ones that are available crash constantly and perform at a subpar level.  It raises the question of why even have an option for apps when there isn't much to offer.  It's like having a coffee store offer only two items for sales complete waste!I was hoping Amazon would deliver but that is simply not the case, I guess you get what you pay for.

Pruitt Jr.", "ReviewID": "R1YZKGWH296Q1H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First let me preface my review with an observation. Most of the negative reactions I've seen for the Fire come from either Apple fans, or people that were expecting something quite difference than what Amazon said they were making. This tablet is marketed as a Kindle, and with good reason. Built from the ground up for content consumption. Amazon's created a top down experience for selling and delivering their digital content all on one device. That content definitely includes apps, but this isn't marketed as an iPad replacement. You'll note that the only time Apple even mentions the iPad in their description is in regards to the device's screen.That being said, I'm loving mine. I upgraded from what's now being called a Kindle Keyboard. I wasn't sure how much I was going to enjoy the transition to color LCD from eink. I really like the later's battery life and how gentle it is on the eyes. Though I've found that with the light text on black setting it doesn't bother me at all. In fact it's probably easier on my eyes reading at night than my little table lamp was with the previous Kindle. The battery life is a big concession, but I can deal with just another device I need to charge on my nightstand before I go to bed.The UI is a pretty severe overhaul of Android, though it does look rather familiar from time to time. I wasn't sure how I'd react to there only being a power button, but in practice I really like every control being easily accessibly just on the touch screen.I was already getting my books through Amazon, as well at TV series to keep up with a handful of current shows. The Netflix app also works great, and it's easier to manage my queue on the Fire than it is my Roku even.It's rapidly becoming my portable entertainment device of choice.", "Date": "December 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "From iPad to Kindle", "Author": "J.

I had it shipped to me unregistered. You are given the option to register at time of checkout or after you receive it. After receiving it, and before I gave it to her, I registered it in her name with a prepaid credit card ($10) and her email address, so she could get started right away with adding free apps and books. She also bought a few apps and a couple books...all with the $10 prepaid card. I am a prime member and sent her an invitation to the kindle lending library. If you are a prime member, you can send 4 invites to share your prime membership benefits with people living at your same address. My daughter is currently reading the latest Seeker book, on her Kindle Fire, on loan from our public library and one of the Dandi Daley Mackall Starlight Rescue Series books on loan from Amazon. I will be giving her an amazon gift card to add to her account at Christmas. She is loving!!!! her Kindle Fire. I am loving that she has absolutely no access to my account!!! There's a lot of love here!I agree with others who are posting that there are many faults. I have spent a considerable amount of time just figuring out all the fixes and possibilities. I do want to say that the [help] button at the top right of my Amazon page, the one right next to [my account] button became my best friend for a couple days. I also called the amazon customer support when I thought the only way to register my daughter's kindle fire was through my account. It was customer support that suggested the prepaid credit card. For younger children who may not have an email account, you can start a second email account in your name using one of the free email services, just for this purpose. This all sounds like a lot of hassle, but in my case, it was definitely worth all the time spent working out the details.If you are wanting to share one Kindle Fire with your entire family, there may be some inconvenience. You may have to disable the 1-click buying after each purchase, at least until Amazon can come up with an update in SW solution to the \"no password required for purchases\" problem. Or use my suggestion above and only use a prepaid card on your Kindle account. I have made two erroneous purchases myself and was able to cancel them right away. I think this may have to be done within a certain time period, though.Sorry for the lengthy review, but I feel I need to stress a few more points:1. When completing checkout, make sure you check the \"gift\" box even if it is not a gift. This will ensure that your Kindle Fire will come in a regular Amazon box. Not one labeled Kindle Fire on all sides for the world to see.2. Make sure it is not preregistered! Both times I went through checkout, I was given the option to register at time of purchase or wait till I received it.3. Use the help button!! I found that most of my issues were easily cleared up this way.4. If you contact customer service and get someone who does not seem willing to help, call again. You will probably get someone new every time. Even though I had a positive experience with CS, I see by the reviews that this is not always the case.5. Don't forget to check your apps store every day for the free paid app featured that day. I am enjoying about 4 I downloaded this way.My daughter and I are enjoying: 1) Netflix; 2) game apps (all my apps have been free), we play WordsWithFriends with family and friends who live far away; 3) Local public library books; 4. free classics from Amazon for Kindle, my favorites are Jane Austin, my daughter's favorites are Jack London; 5.

All of my work must be done at a computer, and any tablet--even an iPad--won't help me with that.  I already owned two traditional Kindles for serious reading and well knew that the LED screen on the Fire would be good only for shorter reading periods and magazines.  I have an iPhone, and so e-mail and web browsing on the Fire would be superfluous.And so, why would I even purchase a Fire in the first place? Well. . . price.  When Amazon promised a tablet computer so inexpensive that I could buy two for the price of an i-Pad yet still have $100 left over for content, I jumped at the chance.  Also, I was excited about being able to use my Amazon Prime membership to stream free videos right to the small device, something I cannot do with my iPhone.My point in all of this is that much of my disappointment in the Fire is my own fault.  I bought the wrong device for only one reason--Amazon Prime Free Streaming Videos--and now that feature has stopped working.Overall, in my limited contact with the Fire, I find it to be a solid bargain at the price when I consider only its technical aspects.  On the other hand, when I evaluate functionality, it really has little.  As an e-Reader, it can't compare to my original e-ink Kindle.  As a tablet computer, its interface is fragmented.  It feels as if different design departments created each of the tabs (Books, Video, Apps, Music, Newsstand) without ever consulting one another.  Each tab feels like a different environment.  Also, the carousel on the Home screen does a poor job of providing quick access and takes up too much space at the same time.  Just because I used something last (a particular book, a website, a song, etc.) doesn't mean that I want it next.  The carousel forces me to scroll endlessly to any app that hasn't been used in a while. I would prefer a home screen that I can organize without being dominated by the showy but pointless carousel (This criticism may be a personal quirk, as I find the cover flow feature of Apple's iPod just as showy and pointless.  Give me a straight forward alphabetized list anytime).E-mail was a problem for me too.  While I was easily able to set up my Gmail account, getting the Kindle Fire to work with a Microsoft Exchange server was a major hassle (Amazon is upfront about this and promises native support in the future). I could find only one third-party app for Exchange mail in the Amazon App Store, and it still wouldn't work (I have been told that in general, Android has problems handling Exchange mail).  Eventually, one of our IT support guys got it working by going outside the Amazon store and grabbing an app known to work with our mail servers.  I'm usually able to solve my own technical issues, but this one was well beyond me.My biggest disappointment--as I alluded above--is in the Amazon Prime Free Streaming Videos.  Lately, I have lost that ability to stream for free; instead, only a purchase button and a \"Learn More About Amazon Prime\" link appear.  I sign in repeatedly, and yet the free streaming button will not appear.  When the service worked (for four days), it was great.  Now that it doesn't, my Kindle Fire usually sits unused and unloved.In short, the device has potential.  It's sized right, powerful, and priced right.  Unfortunately, the OS feels clunky and unrefined and key features have already stopped working for me.  I feel like a beta tester, and perhaps that is exactly what first generation buyers are.I successfully talked myself out of buying an iPad for two years.  Had I known in September what I know now about the Kindle Fire, I would have talked myself out of it as well.

I have had no problems using Google Maps or checking my email on it via the Web, the video is flawless, even Netflix looks great on it. My favorite part is the magazines.

I completely understand that this is not intended to be the main function of the device, but I wanted to try it out anyway.I was able to easily upload a .mp4 file by connecting the Kindle Fire to my computer (using a cable I got with a regular Kindle, since the Fire didn't ship with one) and dragging the file into the Video folder. I initially had difficulty locating the file on the Fire. I thought it would be in the Video section, but it turned out that \"side\"-loaded content ends up in the \"Gallery\" (Apps ---> Gallery). When I found the file and played it, the video playback was good, but there were occasional \"skips\" in the audio (small bleeps).I think the device is probably fine if you want to exclusively buy and play Amazon content. However, if you buy this as I did, thinking it would be a good way to get a cheap portable video player with a nice 7 inch screen, you will probably come to the same conclusion as I did.These are the negatives as I see them:a) Only .mp4 and .vp8 files are supported. If you want to play your .avi files you will have to convert them to .mp4...a time consuming process.b) The Kindle ships with 8 GB memory, but only about 6 GB is usable as storage. I know this is because the Fire is supposed to be more of a \"cloud\" device, but the memory is inadequate for storing your own content.c) There is no SD slot, nor does there appear to be a way to connect a USB thumb drive to the Kindle Fire to play content on the drive.d) The Fire should ship with a USB computer connection cable.e) The video playback of my own content was passable, but nothing to write home about.I'm returning mine...I'll wait for the price to come down on a tablet that allows me more freedom to play and use my own content.", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "kindle fire", "Author": "mom-mom", "ReviewID": "R24X4GKB60BL4T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "great product everything I have been looking for in one compact package.I have been using and discovering  just what all theFIRE is about since it dropped into my mailbox yesterday.

Cole", "ReviewID": "R888M34KHEU94", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had my fire for roughly 24 hours now and have been playing around with it for much of that time. In short, I love the device, However, there are small things that do get annoying. This is my first tablet of any kind so please note that I am really trying to not compare it to anything else.Lets start off with opening the box. No instruction booklet other than a few printed words on a piece of cardboard paper that basically tells you to charge your kindle fire. Eco friendly box, if that matters to you but I am not here to review the box lol.First off, my kindle fire was locked solid when I pulled it out of the box. It would not boot any further than the words flashing on the screen \"Kindle Fire\". With no instruction booklet, I could not find how to try and reset the device. No pinholes that I could see for a hard reset and no reset button. After about 20 minutes or so of fiddling and charging and having no luck, I am one of those that CS is my LAST resort, so I fiddled more and posted in the forums here and someone mentioned holding the button down for 20 seconds to get it to reset. That did the trick. It booted up, I went through the first few steps and put in my password for my network and it immediately found an update and downloaded it and everything was great.Now, unlike any other tablet or phone, this does not have 3g or 4g so this is going to rely on how good YOUR internet connection is and how good your wifi connection is. You are going to have to be realistic here. If your internet is slow and or your wifi is not very good, your probably not going to be very happy with this device. Streaming movies, tv shows, youtube videos, all takes a good amount of bandwidth and without that, that takes a lot away from what this device does pretty well. I have watched several tv shows/movies from amazon (I have been a prime member for a while now) and never had a hiccup once while playing them. I did have some issues with YouTube videos as some would play and some would give an error but most of the time, the error would pop up if you were trying to skip ahead in the video. Video quality is going to rely on your internet speed and wifi. My video quality has been excellent so far with no real issues.I upload a bunch of my music into the cloud weeks before the kindle fire released and playing them from the cloud has been painless and effortless. Sound quality out of the stereo speakers are good and at full volume there is little to no distortion. With that said, it is not a \"room filling\" sound. Its loud, you can hear it, but its not going to ever make you think you are being surrounded by it. Now, if I compare this to the tv shows and movies I watched, I felt it was much better. To me the tv shows/movies are not as loud and harder to hear what the people are saying. Now, Im in my mid 40's, my hearing is not nearly as good as what it once was and I do have constant ringing in my ears so that does need to be taken into consideration. Sound quality through the headphone jack is also very good and for watching tv or movies, that is the way to go for me. One thing to note, you can listen to your music and push the button and have it turn off the screen while your music continues to play, that is a nice touch.Reading books on it, I think I still prefer my regular kindle e-ink. Brightness changes can help but overall its still back lit and may cause people some headaches. Now with that said, I am also a big comic book fan. The comic book reader you can download from the store is pretty nice and I like the way it lets you read the panes one at a time. There are some annoying things about it but thats really for the app owner and not the kindle fire itself.Viewing web pages has been fairly easy. Sometimes its a little slow loading but I would not call it overly slow. I have a netbook here that would make people cringe while waiting for a web page to load lol. Navigation on these web pages with pinch and zoom is something that people are going to have to get used to. It is a 7inch screen after all, so trying to load an entire web page and read it all at once is not going to be possible without pinching and zooming in. Once you get the hang of it though, its not really to bad to get used to.Things that annoy me on the kindle fire:Sometimes for no reason that I can find, it is just slow when you tap on an icon and wait for a response and other times its almost instant.The screen is absolutely beautiful! keep a towl with the device at all times for cleaning as it will show every tap, every slide, every finger print, dust, hair, whatever that touches the device!Surprisingly, it seems a little heavy for its size. Not sure its an annoyance but figured I would throw that in there.The carrousel is very annoying. Every single thing you do is thrown up in there and well, I havent figured out a way to remove them without them wanting to remove the application to.The other annoying thing is that even though my kindle books are showing on there, they are not downloaded to the device and it wont let me remove them either. These last two could be that I just haven't found the way to do it yet. Lets hope that is the case.Ok, Overall I give this device 4 out of 5 stars. I am taking a full star away for the device coming to me in a locked state! For what the device is, it does it pretty darn well. It will suit my needs perfectly! Buyer beware though. With all the different things to buy in the app stores, you could go through lots of money in no time flat. They made it very easy for you to click and buy and get it quickly!

Of course, the Fire goes beyond the original Kindle, but what it can do, it can do extremely well. I really cannot understand how people give bad reviews to a product simply because they haven't received it when they wanted it. I can guarantee that those people will enjoy the Fire just as much as someone who received it on its launch date.

The integrated Amazon Cloud within the Kindle and Music functions is awesome. It all flows seemlessly.  I'm not certain what a negative may be for the Fire. Of course, one can complain that it could of used cameras, and greater internal memory, but again, what is the purpose of the Fire? It isn't here to compete directly head on with the iPad or Xoom.

I don't think I can say anything that hasn't been covered in at least 100 reviews already, so I'll try to keep this brief.  I got this primarily for video and reading comics.The good:-My wife and I have Amazon Prime, and I've been very happy with the quality of the streaming that comes through.  Buffering is excellent, no skips or lagging problems, even on our low tier DSL.-Battery life is good.  I have watched two full movies on it before needing to charge, and that was after performing setup and downloading a couple of things.  It would be great if it lasted as long as my wife's Kindle Touch, but doing more battery intense functions uses more battery.  Nature of the beast.  Recharges are quick, so it's not been out of commission long.-As I mentioned, I wanted to read comics on the Fire.  While it doesn't support my existing cbr or cbz files, there are apps that will read them, and I bought ComiCat.  I don't want to review the app, but it works great.  At first, a 7\" screen seems a little small for a full page, but really, it's not all that straining.  It's kind of like reading digest or ashcan size comics.  I've read 10 or so on it so far, and haven't needed to use a zoom or rotate the screen to make the view larger.-Putting files on was a snap.  I plugged it in, copied what I wanted, and done.-Games work great.  As an entertainment device, the ability to easily find and load some diversions is a must.  Graphics appear crisp, and colors are bright.-Oh yeah, and it's an e-reader.  I haven't done as much with that, but it works ok.  I don't mind reading on a screen, so the backlit screen doesn't bother me as opposed to the eInk readers.  Page turns like reading a microfilm, and I like being able to choose the font style and size.The bad:-The carousel isn't a very intuitive organizational system.  As many complaints as this feature has gotten, I anticipate that this will be a software update fix.-A micro USB to USB with AC adapter would have been preferred to the miro USB to AC that came with it.  My HTC Trophy came with one, so I've been using that to communicate with my PC.-The Silk browser is a little sluggish, but speaking as someone who lived in the days of 56K modems and early LAN speeds, it's not all that bad.  My Windows Phone is faster, but again, it's not like you're waiting for more than a few seconds longer than on anything else.  If you're doing something (like trying to buy concert tickets) where those seconds might matter, I'd suggest using something else.  However, if you're just browsing, it works at an acceptable speed.-It is a little heavy for reading one handed.  Truth be told, I don't read books one handed, anyway.  It's a very minor complaint though, and I felt that it should be mentioned.The skinny:I was nervous that I wouldn't like it, because there had been a couple of negative articles that were written, which were then quoted ad nauseum by various news agencies.  Those pieces are utter trash.  I'm sure that Apple paid well for those hit pieces, because that's all they are.  I've not had any problem with one click purchases (because they're turned off, and that's not hard to do).  Typing?  Easy.  I have not had any problems with so-called \"sausage fingers,\" but if a tech reviewer wants to try typing with the kielbasa he had for lunch, that's his prerogative.  If I don't want the power button on the bottom, I turn it around. The screen rotates, problem solved.  That's a bogus complaint, especially coming from folks who want to turn around and buy a product from a company that once told users that they were holding their phones wrong because they were holding them like ...phones.  No external volume?  Big whoop.  Volume is still easy to change, and I use headphones anyway.  It's easy to remove anything you don't want on the carousel from the carousel, so that's another weak complaint.  If you want to show off your Kindle Fire to someone, take anything you don't want them to know you read/view/do off first.  Look, if you want to buy an iPad, go buy an iPad.  Do everyone a favor and skip the step where you buy the Kindle Fire, review it poorly, and then spend an extra $300 so you can play Angry Birds on a device that starts with a vowel.  However, if you want a great little device that will let you watch movies, read books or comics, play games, and surf the web, for less than a house payment, this is for you.

For $199 you're not getting a $700 tablet. There is no camera, microphone, Bluetooth, GPS, or 3G data service. It's a simple, wifi-only Internet tablet, quite rugged, solid and heavier than you expect. It includes software for music, video, Web browsing, email, Facebook, etc. Many Android apps are compatible and the Amazon appstore is included.* It's designed to work with Amazon services, especially music and video, and it does that very well. Everything in your Amazon media library is available. While it uses Android software under the hood, everything you see is Amazon-focused. If you like movies and you're an Amazon Prime member, this is for you. There's a very good Amazon shopping app, too.* While you can read books on it, the Fire bears little resemblance to the e-reader Kindles. Don't think of it as an e-reader.* It's quite fast and usually smooth. Don't be fooled by the trash talk from iPad owners trying to justify having spent four times as much. But also don't be fooled by Amazon's claim that the Silk browser is magic. The Web is still as bumpy and unreliable as it is on your computer (or the iPad).Supposedly Amazon loses a few dollars on every one of these, planning to make it up in e-commerce sales. To get the price under $199, some nice-to-haves were trimmed. If it had Bluetooth, you could have wireless headphones and a keyboard. If it had a microphone and a camera, you could make Skype calls. But it doesn't. It also doesn't have any Google-branded software like G+, Maps, Gmail, Google Books, Google Market, etc.It's not locked down. You can easily enable third-party software sources and, with a bit of searching, find and install Android software like the Nook reader, Dolphin Web browser, Dropbox, and even a replacement launcher to make it look exactly like a Samsung Galaxy Tab 7. But you don't need any of that to get a lot of value out of the device.The biggest head-scratcher is lack of any access to your Amazon cloud drive's personal folders. Only items you've purchased from Amazon seem to be there. You can attach the Fire to a computer if you have a USB micro B cable and copy data that way.

Bottomline, the Kindle Fire is a steal for the price!", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "For me it wasn't if the Fire does enough but do I really need the Touch instead", "Author": "Akoni", "ReviewID": "R284IK3RDTEHG0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Most of the reviews of the Fire seem to be concerned whether it can do enough. My needs are much different. I travel for a living and always by air. I carry a laptop, smartphone, and a matchbook sized mp3 player. I'm not trying to replace any of those with the Fire. I need a device that will replace my reading material and expand my entertainment options without adding any bulk to what I carry. I'll soon be on my third year of being an Amazon Prime member so my choices quickly narrowed down to the Fire or the Touch.I received my Fire on 11/15. I was on a trip from RDU to SEA on 11/16. Before I left I purchased several books and started a few trial subscriptions to a few magazines. I loaded four movies I converted to mp4 using Handbrake. I also signed up for GoGo inflight internet (I've been allowed to expense it but hadn't got around to because I don't like pulling out my laptop and it seems too wasteful for my Android phone.)Reading books with the Fire isn't as nice as on my gf's Kindle 3. My flight started at mid-day and the screen was good enough. As day turned into night the advantages of e-ink becomes exaggerated because, even with the display brightness turned down, any screen that is backlit makes you feel your staring into a bright light. I didn't realize how much e-ink crushes IPS displays when it is too dark or lighted.On the trip to SEA I watched `Resurrecting the Champ'. I rarely watch movies on airplanes because I don't pull my laptop out inflight and I don't like the video screens on the back of the seats. This is a huge upside for having a Fire. I still have 3 more movies I can watch.Since my company is footing the $40 for GoGo I give it a try. I didn't realize GoGo was so slow. I managed to have patience enough to read NY Times, NPR and ESPN. (FB doesn't seem like the Silk browser.) In the end I use it more for Google Voice which I use to text my gf while I'm still airborne. In the air Internet isn't an advantage but that's not the fault of the Fire. I wouldn't have bought a tablet without an html browser but now that I've had it a week I realize it's no longer a huge plus. I think I'm prejudiced against web browsing on mobile devices because I prefer a keyboard and mouse.Now that I've had the Fire for over a week and have taken a cross country trip with it, was the Fire the right choice? Yeah. IPS isn't as nice as e-ink for reading. To make it worse, the format of e-magazines isn't intended for a 7 inch screen. I'll be cancelling all the magazines except for the Reader's Digest. (Wired is decent but it is free with my mail subscription.) What makes it worth it is that the Fire is a multimedia device. 8 gigs are plenty for my needs in the air. If I didn't have the 8 gigs on my mp3 player I might have felt more crunched for storage space. At home I use the Amazon Cloud Player and my premium Spotify subscription. Spotify is the only app I've side loaded so far.Lastly, I almost returned the Fire because I didn't realize it couldn't use the charger I use for my phone, mp3 player, and BT headset. I didn't want to carry a power brick with me. It turns out there are smaller options than the one provided by Amazon. I bought a foldaway charger w/2 usb ports that was marketed as an iPad charger for $17. It turns out this charger charges my electronics faster than the one I was carrying so I'm happy again.", "Date": "November 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "It's 200 bucks well spent.", "Author": "swtrader", "ReviewID": "RQO4MZZYKD778", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a couple of 'old' Kindles.

I did a lot of research before I bought it, so I'm not going to complain about anything that is missing (such as an SD card slot). If you want a table with a camera or built in 3G, look elsewhere. I've had it for two days now and have found it to be a great device for reading, surfing the internet, watching videos, and playing games. To me, it's the perfect size for reading, since it's about the size of a paperback book and I can hold it with one hand. I don't read outdoors, I read indoors, and I like the fact that I don't have to hunt for a well-lit spot to read with the Fire. I have hundreds of books in epub format, and I have just found out how easy it is to convert those to mobi with Calibre and then transfer them to the Fire. It's also very easy to sideload apps to the Fire, with no rooting required. I had no trouble sideloading Google Earth and Google Maps. I have been pleasantly surprised at how fast the Silk browser is. Pages load much, much faster than they do on my iPhone 4, when connected to the same wi-fi. And, I find it quite easy to read text on ordinary web pages in landscape mode. That was kind of a surprise; I had expected the text to be too small.

For those that dinged it for the slow browser and it being a clunky reader, I can't comment on that yet as I really haven't put it through its paces.Full disclosure, I've got iTouches and Color Nooks and an Android tablet.  We purchased two Kindle Fires with the intent of them being Christmas presents for the kids.  The free (albeit limited) selection of streaming videos for Amazon Prime members was something that interested us and that we thought the kids would love, so the first thing we tried was that.  The next thing was to preload some of the apps the kids got used to, so on went Angry Birds and Cut the Rope and Plants vs. Zombies.  Imagine our concern when my wife and I absolutely FAILED to be prompted for a password to authorize the purchase.  Now, this restriction is in place by default on the Apple devices and on the Color Nooks, it was quickly and easily found in Settings - Shop where you had the option to prompt for a password before making purchases.  On the Kindles?  I found something called \"Parental Controls\" that APPEARED to be similar, as well as something that would disable in-app purchases.  I activated those options (which prompted me for my password, btw) and rebooted the devices, went to buy something else expecting a password prompt only to be disappointed again.  And to be fair, I guess I can't say that this is a problem on the KINDLE but rather on the Kindle FIRE. The old readers had the option to prompt for a password, which was easily found in a Settings menu.  But on the Fire, not only do these options fail to do what you'd expect, but you can also make your way through Help screens so you can also email Amazon for clarification and have them fail to answer the question as to what the heck they actually DO do.Oh, it's all to do with 1-Click?  OK, let me turn that off.  Good.  Done.  Try to purchase on the Fire...getting an error.  That's something at least.  1-Click is disabled.  So, we'll have to purchase content on the PC.  A little annoying, but better than having the kids drop thousands on uncontrolled purchases.  So, purchase that app......which cannot be put into a shopping cart and HAS to be purchased via 1-Click.  <SIGH> Fine!  Turn it on and buy it then download to the device.  OK, OK...done.  Now let me see if purchases on the device are still restricted...NOPE!!!!  FINE!!  Let me go turn off 1-Click for Kindle purchases.  Well, I can add a card or update an expiration date, but no way can I turn it off.  ARRRGGGHHHHH!!!!!!Wait...what's this?  An option on the Kindle Fire to turn 1-Click On or Off.  Well, that has to be the ticket, so let's turn that off on both devices and reboot them, then give it another shot.  Rassum-frassum!!  Good thing I didn't have any easy access to brick walls at the time because I'd have put my head through them.As with others less generous and knocking off another star in the rating, I had a similar experience with Customer Support that they'll pass this along as a product enhancement. Customer Support needs a little help in that the default options send you replies from an address that cannot be replied to, so you have to either send a new message or see if dealing with them on the phone is as fun as swallowing razor blades.  C'mon, Amazon.  Did you not include any parents in your testing of these things?  Did it never occur to you that there might be users with the self-control of a 2nd grader...because the user IS a 2nd grader?  If the iPad wasn't 3 or 4 times as much as the Fire, that would have been the purchase to make.  They already know the interface from their iTouches and I know that the purchases require a password.  For the Fire, if I have a question, I can look in the \"comprehensive\" 23-page User Manual (which includes the cover page and table of contents).  When the User Manual for the e-ink readers is over 120 pages, how can you consider this to be a helpful tool?!?It's touch and go as to whether or not we'll be keeping these or returning them. Hopefully, the kids will not try our patience and make purchases on their own, but if they do, Amazon will be getting a lot of requests to return the items. For the price and in smaller hands, it's a marginally better option than an iPad.  I still can't get over the fact that I need to enter my password umpteen times on the PC when making purchases or checking orders, but don't need to do anything on the device to authorize the same.", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "wow.", "Author": "Storylover", "ReviewID": "R3G7NF57NC43SW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Yes, this is. Frankly. Wonderful.  Ignore any thought of resistance, for it is futile.  I have seen the future of tablets, and it is the Fire.  Get this now, you will only be sorry for that sad time before you had one.  Stupendous.  I'm typing this review on one now at 1 am.  Can't stop using it, don't want to stop.  Simply perfect.**UpdateIt is now 9 AM.  I stayed up another hour after that review just enjoying the tablet.  Now, I am paying for it, as I am tired.  But I am still grinning ear to ear.  Here is my breakdown:Form factor: It is smaller than my ipad (obviously) and sort of fits a different need.  I love my ipad, and I need to be honest about that.  But my Fire feels different somehow--and it is something more portable yet with plenty of screen space.  The ipad is thin and light, but still notebook sized, so you cant stuff it in your pocket.  The Fire can fit in the pocket of men's dress slacks, and can fit in the inside pocket of one of my coats.  Granted, it isn't really comfortable there, but you can do it.  Kinda nifty.  Yet still big enough to enjoy movies and TV show easily.e-reader:It's a kindle, so it is great at e-reading. Small quibble--where is the text to speech?? I don't use it that often, but I do like it.  Hopefully there will be some accomodation of this with software updates or in future Fires.  Not a deal breaker for me, but my wife is sad.  I love the ability to change fonts as well.  Nice.Browsing:Silk is fast, and is pretty easy to use.  It is a tabbed browser, which I like, and has a pretty easy to use bookmark system.  To me it feels like a very sensible, elegantly simple browsing solution.Apps:I downloaded hulu plus, netflix, and angry birds right off the bat just to put it through its paces. Netflix and hulu run flawlessly.  Pandora runs very smoothly and I love using it.  It is easy to listen to pandora while reading, which I love. Currently, there is no support HBO Go that I can find.  Hopefully that will change.Interface:Easy, intuitive, beautiful.  Enough said.Down sides:1. No itunes support.  I know, I know, but let's face it.  People use itunes, and I wish that it were available on the kindle fire.  I bet Apple will be addressing this.  Let the free market prevail.2. No HBO Go app as far as I can tell.3. I have to go to work today instead of playing with my Kindle Fire all day.  Boo.Value and summary:5 stars for value, 5 stars for the interface, 5 stars for its feel in my hand.  It feels solid, substantial, but not too heavy.  This is a smooth, slick, solid feeling, beautiful, well designed, easy to use tablet, and I paid under $200 for it.  Really pretty fantastic.  I am already an Amazon Prime member, so I'm used to the Amazon video library, and of course, it works well.  My kids haven't seen this yet, but I can already tell there will be a fight to see who gets to use it!  It isn't going to replace my ipad, but it is going to do things for me that my ipad can't, size wise.  And ultimately, all my little quibbles about what apps are available are silenced by the fact that this works SO WELL and cost SO LITTLE.

Here is my problem...I haven't been able to get it to see a single book since I've gotten it. My other kindle is SO easy to use. I simply input all my books into Calibre and change them all to TXT format and then upload to my Kindle. This new one I have done that and placed them in the \"Books\" folder. NONE of them showed up. So I thought hm... let's try PDF format. NOPE, still didn't show up. So I emailed them to ask if there was a trick to it and they told me I only showed one book being bought from Amazon. Not the 500 something I told him was in there. Then he's kind enough to tell me all the different formats it reads and of course TXT and PDF are listed. So I think again hmm.. maybe they need to be in the document folder instead, so I delete them all and put them int he document folder. Again no dice. SO obviously this thing only reads the books you buy from Amazon. No wonder they are selling it at a loss there is no choice but to pay them for books since it won't read anything else. I will be sticking to my old kindle and sending this stupid thing back.UPDATE~ I must give Amazon props, they called me after I placed a bad review to try to help, although their Kindle specialists had no idea how to do anything with any books that weren't purchased from them. Here is what I have figured out. Books can not be in a folder. With converter software they are automatically put into a folder with the book cover. You have to convert them then rename them so the cover is the same name as the book and then drag and drop them into the kindle book folder from the folders they are automatically placed in. Some books are locked or something for copyrighting and those books will not show up in the new kindle when you try to copy them from your old kindle. Maybe Kindle specialists will read this so they will know for those of us that already own an extensive book library. Just a bit more work and time to get books onto the new kindle.

After much head scratching I went to Google to find out the problem.  Evidently, Kindle won't allow you to log into any Google acct (google+, and so forth) because they're competition.

I'm one of them. This device has great potential, but it just won't connect to the internet through many people's wifi routers. Because of this, I give the KF a 1 star rating. Currently, the only way I can use it is by going to a semi-local Starbucks.You can also do a Google search for \"Kindle Fire router\" and find a LARGE number of people online posing questions about the issues they're having getting their Kindle Fire connected to the internet through their Wifi routers. This is a systemic problem that really needs some publicity so Amazon will see it as a real issue that needs to be addressed.EDIT: After 4 solid days and nights, spending every spare minute I had reading hundreds of forum posts, reviews, web sites and more, and trying numerous \"fixes\" to gain connectivity between the KF and our router, I was finally able to get it to work by resetting our router back to the factory default settings. Once I did that, the KF miraculously connected to the internet and worked. {and the angels began singing in the background}And now, after a week of using the KF, adding apps, setting up email, watching a show through Netflix and other assorted fun, I felt it was important to come back and revise my one star rating of this product to a 4 star rating. It would have gotten a 5 star rating if it hadn't been so darned picky about the routers it connects to and the settings on those routers. However, the resetting of our router back to the factory default settings did the trick for us (my husband has a KF too) and now we're both happy campers with our KF. I'm just glad I was persistent with my attempts to fix the problem instead of doing what my husband wanted me to do within the first hour of router troubles: \"Send the **** things back to Amazon!\"For those of you who are having router troubles, you might try these potential fixes:1. Enter the correct wifi password/passkey/passphrase and make sure its less than 15 characters long and does not contain any special characters2. Try setting your wifi access with a static IP address (I tried it and it still doesn't connect properly)3. Enter the MAC address of the KF if your router uses MAC addressing for part of its security4. SSID should be less than 10 characters, again with no special characters5. Kindle is currently on version 6.1 or version 6.2 (we received ours with the current version)6. Reboot router7. Rebooted KF8. Completely turn off router firewall and see if that helps9. After a BRIEF success with changing router channels, I then tried all channels, 1-11, and had no additional success.10. Be sure your router's SSID is broadcasted to the public (some people have posted it doesn't work if it's not a broadcasted SSID)11. Change wifi security settings from WPA2 to WPA or vice versa12. Updated the firmware on your router to the current release.13.

I ordered the 1st Gen. Kindle Fire for my daughter as a birthday present in May of 2013 and as of yet I have had no issues or problems with the device. My daughter loves her Kindle and would spend all day every day playing games and watching videos if I didn't set time limits on her activities.Kindle Free Time: One aspect that I particularly like about Kindle's is the Kindle Free Time; parents can decide which types of content their children are allowed to view; whether or not to block the internet, email, or video content; and can manually choose which apps or books their children are allowed to view- furthermore, if you have more than one child you can create profiles for each child and choose the type of content allowed for each child. For example, you can choose that one child has access to videos while another child may not have access to the web. Also, with Free Time parents can set time limits for each activity- such as playing games or watching videos- and can set a limit for the total time a child can spend on the Kindle each day; set daily goals (for educational apps, books, etc.); or block access to entertainment types of apps until educational goals are reached. Also, there is an option to block all access during certain times- perhaps from 8 pm- 8 am so kids can't sneak in a little extra play time at 3 am! Kindle Free Time is available on both the Kindle Fire 1st generation as well as the Kindle Fire HD.Appearances: The edges of the 1st generation are not as rounded as the edges of the 2nd generation; which I actually prefer to the rounded edge of the newer Kindle (that is just my personal preference, some people may prefer the rounded edges.) The 1st generation has a full-color touch screen, and the color actually looks really good- the 2nd generation is HD, so the color is better on the newer version, but I have no problems with watching movies or videos on the 1st generation as the colors are vibrant and rich. In a nutshell, the color is great on the 1st generation and even better on the Kindle Fire HD. The 1st generation is sleek and easy to hold in one hand, and it is much, much lighter than a lot of other tablets- specifically the iPad. There is some glare when you are in direct sunlight, but nowhere near as bad as with the iPad, so I can use my Kindle outside.Content: The content is the same for the 1st generation and the Fire HD; you get access to millions of books, songs, videos, and apps. If you have Amazon Prime (which I highly suggest because it is awesome!) you can borrow one free book per month; I take advantage of this a lot! Both versions have free Cloud storage, so if you download a book on one Kindle you can access the book from another Kindle. For example, I use my Amazon account for my Kindle as well as my son's and my daughter's so I can read a book I purchased on my son's Kindle by downloading the book from the Cloud.Sound: The sound on the 1st generation is very clear, and the speakers are actually much louder (and better) than those of my iPhone. I was really very pleasantly surprised by the clarity of the sound on the 1st generation. I compared the sound to that of the Kindle Fire HD and found the quality to be very similar, but the HD is marginally better.Battery: Depending on how you use your Kindle- the brightness, the number of apps you have running, or whether or not you have WiFi enabled- the battery life will vary. However, I have found that the battery life generally lasts for about 6 hours if you are watching videos or playing games, and about 8 hours if you are reading- again, that time will vary depending on your settings. The Fire HD battery life is significantly better- about 12 hours of mixed use and about 16 hours of reading time. One thing you should be aware of, Kindle's don't come with a wall charger; you will have to use the USB port to charge your Kindle. I don't like plugging my Kindle in to my computer to charge, so I use a spare converter from my iPhone charger which works perfectly (the detachable white piece that you can plug in to the wall), but the USB charger works well when I want to charge my Kindle in the car a charger. If you are using your Kindle while it is charging it will not charge very quickly, so I try to avoid using mine while it is charging. The time it takes for the Kindle to fully charge- from 0%-100%- can take about 4 hours. Personally, I think this is too long; so, if there were one thing I could change it would be the length of time it takes to charge. However, this seems to be the case with both the 1st generation and the Fire HD.Additional features: Both work well with Gmail, Yahoo, and Outlook, as well as Facebook; so using social media or email should not be an issue with either version. As another reviewer previously stated, the 1st generation does not support Flash so you may encounter issues with certain types of video. However, this has not been an issue for me personally as of yet. Perhaps the most important difference would be the speed. The Kindle Fire HD is faster than the 1st generation; the 1st generation isn't particularly slow- the Fire HD is just that fast. The 1st generation is 8GB- which was more than enough for my daughter, but not enough for me- and the Fire HD is 16GB.Overall: The 1st generation and the Kindle Fire HD are both great products, but I certainly prefer the HD. The Fire HD does not cost much more than the 1st generation and the upgrades (faster, better sound, more memory, better picture and battery) are well worth the additional price, so I would recommend the HD in almost all circumstances. If you are on a budget the Kindle Fire 1st Generation is still a great buy, but with the additional $30 off right now the Fire HD is only $119- which is the exact same price as the 1st generation, so there is really no reason not to upgrade at this point!I apologize for the length of this review, but I wanted to be thorough and address as many issues as possible. If anyone has any questions for me please feel free to leave me a comment and I would be happy to help you; I hope this information helps!Update: I forgot to mention that the Kindle Fire HD has a camera, and the 1st generation does not. The picture quality with the HD is quite good.", "Date": "May 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "\"But when she was good...\"", "Author": "bill flanagan", "ReviewID": "R14IUOO73SYD5L", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Product: 4 StarsUSB Connector: 0 StarsAmazon Customer Service: Black hole.This was my wife's first tablet. It was a snap to set up and worked well. It was ridiculously easy for a person more interested in content than technology to become even more of an avid Amazon customer than she had been before. We recommended it to our friends and relatives, at least 3 of whom immediately bought it as well. In fact we had 2 at one time. I traded mine for an older iPad 1 with a slightly damaged but usable first generation iPad; In the time I had it, I liked it. Unlike the Kindle Fire, I can still charge it and gets used daily.Amazon did a great job integrating Google's Android OS into their customer universe. Although it's a pretty old version of the android OS at this point, it does its job. In this case, Amazon built on something that worked and, for their customers, made it better. Good job.IF ONLY Google had designed the stupid USB power connector that now serves as a hinge to let the USB cord swing like a pendulum beneath it. Maybe we would be posting the previously deserved 5 star review rather than this 1 star tear.I'll probably be considered an ingrate for having a product a long time and then have it stop at the end of its useful life. The small crack on the screen of my now VERY old iPad is the only thing wrong wit hit. It holds a charge for days and still works with the older 4.x apps that we have on it. When it stops being useful as it is, it will be retired to my bedside as an alarm clock.What really makes me mad is that the Amazon Kindle Fire that has no cracks and a battery that still holds a charge, in theory, will probably never be used again. The USB connector on this unit broke, just like the one this unit was sent to us as a replacement for.The Amazon rep had the nerve to say that the USB problem, one we have lived with for along time now, playing with the USB for an eternity until the little lightning bolt tells us that it is charging, was something they had really not heard of as a problem.Amazon, if you can make flying delivery drones or hire flying moneys as stand-ins until then, why can't you stand behind your defective product? This was clearly a work-in-progress that allowed you to better know the market and develop the latest HDX which, by all accounts is rated as good as if not better than an iPad.We bought weeks after the product announcement. From what we read in the press, Amazon would sell at a loss if needed just to continue to grow their dominance in the book, music, and video markets.By saying we read books on this device, Amazon should know that we are, like many other reader, literate enough to read the scores of posting on the web about the problems with their charging port. It is a PRODUCT DEFECT and not a an issue of owner negligence. Our car still has a gas cap after 11 years. If it falls off, we can order an easy to install replacement on Amazon for it .Look at YouTube: there are so many videos explaining how to replace the USB port that it's almost funny. The glitch is that you need to know how to micro-solder at least 4 contacts onto the circuit board that is secured with a few dozen screws in the bowels of the device. The screws, I can handle. But spending $10 to $15 on Amazon for a replacement micro USB socket then dedicating a weekend to getting it in place is not in the cards.One online repair firm charges $39.50 to do it. They claim replacement isn't the problem: in their experience many of their repairs came back to them not because of the quality of their connection but because there never was any mechanical stability in the first place and have to improvise to glue or solder on additional stiffeners to keep it from recurring.When I called Amazon, after telling me that this was a rare if not unheard of problem that is just part of having a consumer electronic product, they quickly offered to sell me a new more recent device for around $120.This isn't customer service. This is inventory management: the unit they offered to sell for that price was the previous generation product an not the current one generating rave reviews. Using people dumb enough to buy a first generation product as the dumping ground for left over previous year devices isn't a sign of respect for people who just want to continue to want to buy stuff from Amazon.I am really sorry, Amazon. I know this review will be discounted as just another crank selling sour grapes. I just had to say something after my recent call. I don't like to be told that what I read and experience is new and unique or gleaned from the yammerings of other malcontents.Grow up and deal with us as client and not as rubes. Tell your service people not to use their own experience to justify why our problem is unique (\"I have the same model and I've never had a problem with it...\"). At least give them a script to read that doesn't make people with legitimate issues feel that we're wrong about what we know.*** This review was NOT written on my Kindle Fire...

Then, it happened.  Just like the thousands of others who have posted this same issue on tons of other forums; it stopped charging.  The charging port no longer works. The device works fine, but now I cannot charge it so I cannot get to any of my downloaded content or use it and there is nothing to be done.I have NEVER written a review of anything before, and I do a fair amount of internet shopping.  I certainly rely on other's reviews so I appreciate those who take the time to write them.  Don't buy a 1st generation Kindle Fire.  If you are lucky, it will last you a year.  Ours is out of warranty, so Amazon will do nothing but give us a discount on purchasing the same exact issue.  I'm not too keen to spend even more money to end up with the same problem.  If you Google this issue, pages upon pages come up on this topic. Some people are on the 4th or 5th Kindle and every one replaced because the units will no longer charge. They are lucky, theirs was under warranty.  I don't know if the Fire II has this same issue, I'm reading mixed reviews on that.

I've had it almost 8 months now and can say I'm quite frustrated with it.  I am an avid reader and own around 3000 e-books, so I was frankly stunned to find that there is no way for me to sort my books by genre on this device.  This is the first e-book reader I've seen that didn't have an option to make collections, folders, or otherwise sort your book collection.  When I go into my Kindle on the amazon site there isn't a way to sort by genre there either!  Finding books is a nightmare unless you have the ability to remember the title and author of every book you own.  This device would probably be great for the casual reader who only reads a few books a year, but isn't for someone like me who reads hundreds.  I can't even go back to my old reader because I gave it to my brother.  For now I'm making do with it but if this issue isn't addressed I will not be buying another amazon device when I have the money to upgrade again.  Not being able to sort my books is a deal breaker for me.I'm also frustrated with the audio player.  I have many audiobooks in mp3 format.  I am able to put them on the device and listen to them; but there is no way to make a bookmark.

Aside from the fact that the Fire does not take photos, I am easily able to surf the web and use it as a replacement for my tab device. The electronic books are impossible to put down once you start reading them. There is something about the page format that is compelling to the reader and encourages you to keep reading. I am not certain why this is. You will have to be careful to turn the device off completely when not in use; otherwise, the batteries will run down quickly. Unlike my wife's original Kindle, this device does not have network access and can only be used with wi-fi. This trait is fine when you have easy access to wi-fi -- but, not so good if you are using it in a more remote location. I can also say that, when opening up web pages in the browser, the font is very small and can sometimes be difficult for older eyes to read. Enlarging the font or the page is possible, but then the page does not comfortably fit onto the screen.

I had explored my brother's iPad and thought it was amazing.  I assumed the Kindle Fire could not compete due to the price difference - $199 vs. $500+?  There was no way the Kindle Fire was capable of anything other than a touch screen book in color.  I was so wrong!  It can do almost everything the iPad can, and I prefer the size and setup.  It's an amazing value.  Books.Movies.Magazines.Music.Art.Audiobooks.Apps.Games.Music Videos.Docs.Pictures.Web.Email.EVERYTHING.  I can get all Microsoft applications, samples of books containing the first few chapters and workout videos.  I find something new everyday!  It is as user friendly as an iPad and iPhone, and can perform all the functions I usually use on my laptop (which I use maybe 1-2 times per week).  I am loving the fact that I do not have to lug my heavy laptop everywhere!  The battery life is amazing too.

I have a shell case that is adorable, water-resistant, and the front also acts as a stand (helpful when watching movies or TV).  My sister has a Kate Spade case, which is so cute.  The screen protectors are a must have to keep the screen fresh and clear - many make it easier to read outside without a glare.ALSO, the Kindle Support is unbelievably helpful!  I had so many questions in the beginning, and the guide either successfully answered them or pointed me in the right direction.  The response time is extremely fast as well.  Could not ask for better customer service!!This is a product you want to own.  Its lightweight and thin exterior make it easy to hold and carry, and its speed and capabilities are comparable to that of an iPad at less than half the price.

In class, they tell us what page numbers to read and I have to go to the index to search for the term or page number that is associated with the location in the book, make a bookmark for that page, and then go and do the same of the last page I'm supposed to read (example: pages 256-287, bookmark 256 so I know where to start and then bookmark pg 287 so I know where to stop). It's not a deal breaker by any means but it is tedious and time consuming when I could just start reading and not have to deal with all of that.

There are a few flaws in the product, but it is overall a very good buy.My first problem is that my fingers are very fat and I have a very hard time using the built in keyboard.  Unfortunately, the Kindle Fire will not accept any exterior keyboard so I find that when I have to type ANYTHING, it is excruciatingly difficult to get it right without multiple do overs.  I am getting a stylus which will help, but the lack of a usable keyboard is a real drag.The Kindle Fire is very easy to use and very intuitive, so you almost don't have to use any instructions in order to use the device effectively.  The one drawback that I had with the MP3 music is that much of it that is sold on Amazon is not the original tunes and it is easy to mistake a knockoff for the real item.  I still have not found a way to exclude the duplicate fakes and just surf the real songs, so I just have to be extremely careful that I do not select a fake.  Secondly, if you do get a tune that you do not want, it is almost impossible to get rid of it.  It will stay stored in the Cloud and will remain there unless you contact Amazon itself to get it removed.  What a hassle!You can read books for free at the rate of one a month, one at a time.  If you are a voracious reader, this is entirely too little.  I would like to download more than one book at a time but cannot unless I buy the book.  Since I frequently have two or three books going simultaneously in real life, the restriction to only one at a time is a bit off putting.  If you read less frequently, then this is not much of a problem.  I do plan on using the Kindle Fire to read my magazine subscriptions which will save on all the paper and need to recycle magazines that I have finished.  Hooray!There are a lot of free things available including apps, books, music and videos which can keep one entertained forever.  If you do decide to purchase items, having the convenience of a one click  purchase is sooooooo niiiicccceee.  Highly recommended.Before using the Kindle Fire, get a case to protect it against bumps and bruises.  Also, get a screen protector to cut down on fingerprints and make the screen easy to clean.  Lastly, if you use the Kindle away from your Wi Fi source very much, like in the car, invest in a charger to keep the Kindle going (reading, games, videos, et al).  Nothing will bum you out more than to come to a key point in the game and the Kindle shuts down because there is no more battery power available.  Is this any way to treat my superhero avatar?  It does recharge fairly rapidly, so that is a bonus.I hope my review will provide useful information prior to your buy.  I like the Kindle a lot, in spite of a glitch or two.

It's a decent size and the colors are terrific too.

You have all seen this before, but let me reiterate, the Kindle Fire is not, nor was it ever designed to be, an \"I-pad killer.\" Quite simply, it is an entertainment device which for those who are Amazon users, provides one of the best experiences you could ask for on an entertainment device. One of the only cons I could find with this device is the lack of a microphone and no camera/forward facing camera for pictures or Skype related activities, however for only 199$ you won't find me complaining.Experience: I have owned this device for close to a year now as of 6/27/12 without so much as a hiccup, this is a very solid and well manufactured device.", "Date": "June 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best money I have ever spent!", "Author": "BMcCraw", "ReviewID": "RRCPJS9OUKIMC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had a Kindle since they first came out a few years ago, so upgrading to the Fire was a \"no-brainer\".

Why spend more on a iPad or some other high-end tablet? The Kindle Fire isn't perfect, but for the price it can't be beat, plus you get a vast library of Kindle books and videos.Here are my pros and cons:Pros1. Cost2. Plays Videos without a hiccup as long as you have a good high-speed wireless internet connection.3. Vast library at Amazon, better if you have a Prime Membership account.4. Font is easy to read on the Kindle Fire, making a reading a book easy on the eyes.Cons.1. Weight - While at first it doesn't feel to bad, it starts feeling a little heavy after a hour worth of reading. No big deal, either build up your muscles or take a break for a bit.2. I notice when looking for videos that the screen will do a very small pixel dance, but thankfully it doesn't do that when reading or watching videos.3. Book reading, watching videos and maybe very light gaming on it is the only thing you can do, but as I stated if you want more then you should be looking else where.I do think the pros diffidently outweigh the cons.

I tried to recreate some of the complaints and found now.  I can only think that the ones that bought the Fire thinking they were getting an Ipad were disappointed.  I love technology but, I'm not willing to pay over $300.00 for anything, I waited and when I was able to snag a $30.00 off coupon from Amazon Local I jumped on this deal and bought my fire.  It's everything I need while away from my Laptop, yes my smart phone does a lot but there are limits, and here is where my fire comes in. I'm able to play my games, Word with Friends, Scramble, Anger Birds, etc. with no problem.  I even went to Amazon Prime Video (which I can download for free) to see how the Fire perform while watching a movie and I have no complaints.  I can't tell you what a Ipad can do, I only imagine much more, but I must say the Fire does exactly what I need. Take it from one that wants more for her money, you will not go wrong with the Kindle Fire.  For those that complained that a Micro USB wasn't included, if you have a HTC, Samsung, Kindle, Motorola H17, etc you can use the same micro USB or buy one for under $3.00 Amazon.

I received it back about a week and a half ago and have been using it avidly. I've started reading more because of the Fire, I just wish books weren't so expensive for it.Being an Amazon Prime member allows you to borrow 1 free book every month so that is pretty nice, although if you do enjoy reading a lot, it's not very much. I ended up finishing the book I borrowed in about 3-4 hours so that was kind of sad. You can also borrow books from your public library for free, but there's generally a very long wait list for the popular books. PDF files of books are also available for download online at some sites if you look for it. It's very simple to transfer files onto the Kindle as long as you have a micro usb cord. You just plug it into the computer and then drag files over into the appropriate folder.I really do not like the carousel at all. After almost every time I use my device, I end up removing the tabs from carousel. I don't like how it covers more than half the screen. I would have rather had the favorites list do that. One of the other things that I dislike a lot is that there is no physical home screen button. It gets very annoying to have to tap the bar at the bottom of the screen because sometimes I have to tap it 5 times before it registers while I'm in some apps. Also, the web browsing, it always shows the recent history list, or opens the last previous page you went to. Is there way to remove that?The no physical volume control button doesn't bother me that much since I have my sound off for most of the time. I do mainly use the Fire for reading. Netflix is pretty nice on this though. It's easier than watching it on a laptop if I'm in bed. I can just turn it off and put it under my pillow and won't even notice it is there. I don't try to listen to music on this, I have my phone for that.There's quite a few apps available on the Fire, I don't use many of them though. I do light gaming on it. The free app of the day is really nice. I end up just downloading it and removing it if I don't like it, but it's always fun testing new stuff out. The email app isn't that bad, I actually prefer it to my phone's email app. The size of the Fire is pretty nice as well, I can hold it like I would a cell phone with 2 hands as I would texting, I would send an email instead.I don't mind that there is no camera, I don't need one. If I wanted to video chat, I would use my laptop since I can type as well. It would be sort of awkward holding the Fire, or any tablet to video chat and take pictures. There is no microphone. I would like one, even though I actually don't need it. It would just be nice for an app that I have so I don't have to plug in my headset every time to use it.I don't really know how long the battery life is. I feel like it is shorter than the 7-8 hours it said if you go on the internet or do anything else at all besides reading or watching things that were pre-loaded onto it. Is there a way to view battery percentage without going though settings and viewing device? That would be nice. I have had no problems with the charger as some people have been.For 139 dollars, I think it's a great device. It fulfills all my needs and doesn't have any extra things that I wouldn't end up using. A SD slot would be convenient, but it's not necessary for me, I don't have a reason to be putting that much stuff on it in the first place. PDF files are like 5mb/file? Movies are about less than 1gb each, so at one time, you could put 4 movies on it, and it's not like you would be watching those movies over and over again unless they are your favorite so you could just swap it out every time you have a chance to charge your device.I would not want to spend 200 dollars on this device though. For 200 dollars, you could get so much more, especially now. Due to the Kindle Fire's price, the price of other tablets have dropped greatly. I would pay more for the Fire if it had better specs. It has no camera SD slot, microphone, HDMI, or bluetooth, which some 200 - 250$ tablets do have, so I feel like if I were going to be paying that same price for a device without all of those things, the Kindle Fire should at least have more storage, built in memory, and a better battery life than those other devices.I love my Kindle Fire, I do. It's a great device, and for 139 dollars, it's completely worth it. It would be a great idea for parents who have younger children who like watching videos on it in restaurants or car rides because it is cheaper, and you don't have to be afraid of damaging a 500 dollar device.So my final thoughts are: buy this device if it is on sale! Refurbished comes packaged as a new one would, and it still has a 1 year warranty. Also, it's from Amazon themselves. Pretty awesome. :)P.S. So the no physical home key actually might be better in some cases for some people. I used to babysit a boy who loved watching things on the iPad, but he also loved pressing the button and would freak out every time he pressed the button since the video turned off. And if you blocked the button, he got very upset, so he would get upset either way.", "Date": "June 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "7 year old LOVES!!!", "Author": "L.

I thought that I wouldn't like it much. Because I already have a laptop and an iPod touch, I wondered what use I could put my Fire to.The next day, my laptop fan failed. I was watching a TV show I was in to, and I simply HAD to know what happened next. My iPod's screen seemed a bit unwieldy for watching videos, and it does get a bit irksome, watching something on a small screen that is meant for a large one. So I turned to my Fire. I discovered that media is simply superb on this device. I watched movies on it nearly hourly, while I had Prime. Also, the speakers make it nice for just playing music. Photos really burn with the Fire. It has a very vibrant screen. For a while there, it was my primary computer like device. I had an online class, and I did all of my daily work and turned it in with my Fire. Worked pretty well with the accounting site... Then, I started to read again- stupid teenage phases. I read now, from early afternoon to late in the morning. While not good for me, I suppose, it has helped me rediscover the joy in reading. I have been very surprised at how wonderful my  Kindle is. I've found a few minor kinks, of course- setting my own static IP address(which worked out eventually), no bluetooth, and eventual eye irritation from reading for so long on an LCD screen. However, the Fire has been a very useful product so far. I am now even considering doling out my hard earned cash to buy an E- Ink Kindle. Not set on which one yet, but that is beside the point. I would recommend the Fire to anyone that asked.

The $199 Kindle Fire is perfect for watching videos on Youtube, checking personal email and browsing the internet including shopping on Amazon! This is all that I do. I don't wish to use my work laptop because big brother is watching. It's a light very portable & fast device which I can carry in my briefcase, and never leave in my hotel room.

I highly recommend Targus Vuscape leather case $29 which allows 3 viewing angles and is best made case to fit Kindle Fire.I tested 5 cases in all.

I use it mostly as a tablet and it is awesome.  People have complained that there was no alarm, calendar or calculator included, however I have not found this to be a problem as there are free apps for all of those and they work great.  The web browsing is great and it is very fast.  I love all the alerts that it gives me when I have a new email.  I have downloaded several magazines and I have been very impressed with them and how nicely they look on the fire.  I have also have downloaded several books as well and although the fire gets a little heavy after awhile I find the e-reader is great as well.  It plays movies well and the screen is clear.  The only thing I haven't really used is the music player as I have my ipod for that.  The only real drawback is that there is only 8G of memory, there isn't a model with more available and you can't expand the memory as there is no SD card slot.  I only have 1G of memory left and I've only had my fire for 2 weeks.  I currently have 60 apps, 5 magazines, 4 books and no music or videos downloaded to the fire, so it's not like it takes a whole lot to use up the memory.  The nice thing is that you can store some of the items you don't use very often on the cloud to free up some space.  Since I am not really into music or videos I think that the memory issue won't be too much of a problem for me.

I love that I can read or watch movies/tv shows; the versatility is really, really nice.  I was a Kindle Touch owner and I am currently an Android owner, so the Kindle Fire was perfect for me.  I chose this over an iPad because of the cost and the size, mostly.  I've had mine for about two months and I use it for hours every day.  It is very, very easy to use; very user-friendly.  The size and weight of it is just right for a \"tablet\"; it isn't too bulky and it fits nicely in my bags.  Please keep in mind that this is NOT a tablet, really, and that it should not be compared to the iPad.The reading function is great; I've had no problems with it.  I read a lot.  This is the feature I use the most.Being able to browse the internet is fabulous, however, wi-fi is required which is sometimes inconvenient.  The browser is really fast; and it seems pretty flawless to me so far.The battery life is so-so; I can read for hours before I have to charge it.  For me, it works.  I can read during the day and charge it at night.  I've never run into the issue where my battery was dying while I was using it.  For some, though, especially if you're using the video/internet part of it, there will probably be an issue with the battery life.  I have watched videos/movies on it and it does drain the battery quickly... maybe two movies before a recharge.  I've never tested this, though.The quality of the video is great.  I've had no issues with any buffering or anything.  Playback from videos and movies has been very smooth... even the media streamed from Amazon.  I downloaded the MX Player app (the .apk) to use to watch movies and TV shows that I put on using my usb cable; it works very, very well.The biggest issue for me is memory.  There is very little memory for movies or anything, but I imagine that is so that we will use Amazon to stream video content. It isn't very conducive if you want to load it with movies/TV shows for a trip or anything. It would be nice to a usb port and have the ability to play video content off of a flash drive. (Maybe on a future version?) The second issue is that sometimes the screen is hard to see outside in the daylight.  I tried watching a TV show and I had to give up because I just couldn't see it.  It isn't a huge issue for me since I don't normally use it while I'm outside, but it was kind of a bummer.I don't have a screen protector, but I did get a nice cover for it (Kindle Fire Lightweight MicroShell Folio Cover by Marware).  I'm very happy with it.The Kindle Fire itself is a great product which could use some improvements.  I'm sure they will come out with a better version which will address all of the customer complaints, but, considering the price, it is a really great value. Overall, I'm very pleased with it.I did have to contact customer service to have a new one shipped to me after two weeks.  I was on the internet and the Kindle locked up while browsing. I pressed the button on the bottom to turn the screen off and after I did that I couldn't use it again; it must have locked up permanently.  I haven't had that issue with the replacement, but I did hear that other people had the same issue.  It isn't overly common, but it has happened.  I was without it for two days, but it didn't bother me all that much.

This feature reduces the interval between battery recharges, but I have yet to 'run out' during any reading session.

I am thankful this does not happen very often.I recommend, for future kindles, an improved (more obedient) operating system.The speakers are not great, but they are OK.

While this is nice, you have to remember that \"you get what you pay for.\" In Amazon's case, you get a few extra benefits, such as a lower price on the digital content.I like the Kindle Fire. I give it only four stars because of the issues with its operating system. I would give it five stars if these issues were fixed.I think the large amount of electronic content available at Amazon.com, plus the reasonable prices, puts Amazon in the winning category.

For those of you who are outside the United Status and are in the process of evaluating Kindle as one of your tablet options, this could be of some help to you:Kindle Fire Limitations (esp. when viewed from an international destination)  Amazon's marketplace is the default marketplace for Kindle Fire and de-facto market place for you that I am aware of. Google Play does not work (have tried it, but the app fails).  Multimedia Subscription: The music and video rental market is expanding rapidly in the U.S. With Amazon Prime membership, Kindle Fire offers excellent benefits if you are a movie or music buff. However, if you are outside of the United States, its usually not easy (will explain how to get around these limitations in the next section).  Hardware Limitations: On the down side, some users would miss camera and mic support. It is understandable that it does not have telephony support, but a mic and camera would have made Kindle a real winner. But, hey, for the price you are paying, you can't complain much.  Kindle also does not have support sd-card and thus, expanding the disk space is a concern for some. Amazon cloud is a practical way of extending the disk space, but for those outside the United States where bandwidth could be a premium, with most ISPs moving towards offering limited bandwidth, this option is also not viable (opex wise).  App download: Not only can you not rent movies and music from Amazon, you cannot also download apps (even free ones) from Amazon Market place if you are outside the United States. This is the most serious limitation for many in India and single handedly eliminates all the advantages we have highlighted thus far.  In my opinion, Amazon should have a followed a more liberal policy towards international customers and allowed apps to be downloaded freely - much like Google Play.Overcoming the limitations:  Use U.S credit card and Address: For those who are lucky enough to have a friend or cousin in the U.S and be able to convince them to rent their credit card, this is the easiest option. Simply update the shipping address and the U.S credit card details on Amazon. This alone will enable you to download 100s of free software and free videos from Amazon's marketplace.  Note: you can still buy your Kindle using International credit card, post which you can update your 1-click address using the u.s address/credit card option I mentioned above. Your phoren cousin does not have to shell out a dime if you manage to download only free apps and videos.  Sideload Apps:  For those of you who do not have a Phoren cousin, worry not, there are numerous public market places from where you can download the APK files into Kindle. GetJar, Android Central etc are good web sites from where you can download Android compatible apps.  Using this option, I was able to download Facebook, Linked in, Adobe Flash, PDF, Angry birds and most other apps for free.  Note: About 10% of the apps have incompatibility problem, but most others work perfectly well.  Swype, Google Play, Google Drive are some of the useful apps I have not had success so far.  Disk Space: You can use your laptop as your extended hard drive. In order to do so, you can download numerous utilities that extends your Kindle Fire as a HTTP or FTP server. One such app I can recommend is Aico File Manager, which acts a file manager + unzip tool + ftp+http server.  Note: Google Drive is not compatible with Kindle Fire as of this writing. You can download Dropbox or Amazon Cloud Drive and use the free space available to extend storage.  Microphone: I am sure you would have guessed it now. Use a standard 4 pin microphone + earphone jack that comes with your mobile, voila, you now have voice input. So, several utilities such as Vlingo, Skype, Tango etc can be at your service. Suddenly, you Kindle Fire is also your Voip Phone.  Note: I have not tried this option yet, but will try it and provide an update on my experience.If you are a semi  techie and do not mind exploring the brave world of tablets/mobile, Kindle Fire can be a very good bet at an incredibly low price.For content consumption of all kinds such as browsing, ebooks, music listening, photos, videos, office documents, email etc, Kindle Fire gets a huge thumbs up. I have experienced this to be both practical and simple to use.  There are thousands of blogs and articles that would help you to jump start your journey. I have added a few links here below for your reference.On the other hand, if you are not venturesome, but are looking for something beyond Ebooks, Kindle Fire is not something that you should look at.", "Date": "May 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Birthday gift", "Author": "Jeanette Mackay \"nette53932\"", "ReviewID": "R237RH9IE40P49", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My husband loves his Kindle Fire!!

It looks and operates like a new one. It's my first kindle device and I am very happy with it. Didn't take long to figure out how to operate, even for an ol' guy like me.Connected to my wireless without a hitch. Does data transfers from my computer with the usb cable that I purchased separately. I use the Calibre software to store my book collection on my pc and can then transfer it to and from the Fire. One thing I wish it had was the text to speech function that other Kindles have. It can read audio books out loud but not any book like some of the other Kindles can. Why they left this function off the Fire is not clear to me. I have seen some apps that say they can do this for the Fire but I haven't tried them. I think this should be an application that should be native to the Fire. Maybe this will change in the future as I see quite a few people that list this as a reason for deciding which Kindle model to purchase.Setting up my e-mail account with hotmail was easy. Pretty much just had to type in my username and password and it did the rest by connecting to hotmail and downloading all the configuration details needed for it to run on the Fire.Getting my contacts into the Fire took a few more steps. Basically you have to convert you contact files into to V-card format and then tranfer them via usb cable to the Fire. Then you open the e-mail app on the Fire and search the device for v-cards. I think this is one area that could be simplified in the future. It wasn't to difficult for me but some people may have a harder time figuring out how to convert their contacts to v-cards and getting them to the Kindle.The battery life, like most electronic devices depends on what you're doing on it. When I first got it I was using all the functions on it quite heavily to test it out. Watching movies, surfing the web, checking e-mail, receiving books wirelessly and I think in about a little over 4 hours it was getting close to needing a charge. I'm not a heavy user of all these functions but I wanted to know the battery's ability. I did purchase a car charger separately because of this testing of the battery. I think, let's say you had to spend the day at jury duty and took your Fire with you. If you used it moderately heavy I think you might not make it through the day with it without a charge. Now if your just using it to read and only turn on the wireless when needed you would make it through the day easily and this is the area I fall into but heavy users be prepared for a charge.Overall I'm thrilled with the device though. Bought it mainly for reading but it's nice to have the connectivity function. It's great to be reading a book and be able to search the web from a page I'm reading, and of course the definition of a word on the page ability by touching your finger to it is like something out of science fiction. If somebody told you 20 or 30 years ago that you could get a definition to a word by touching it on the page, well you would have looked at them like they had 3 heads!My reason for not giving the Fire 5 stars is simple. To me 5 stars denotes perfection. Is the Kindle Fire a great device? Yes! Is it perfect? No! (I'm not comparing it to the ipad either.) If you tell somebody what they built is perfect where is the motivation for doing anything more to it? There are some tweaks and improvements that can be made to it. Will it ever be perfect? Probably not, but I think striving for perfection should be our goal in personal life and business. And if we don't achieve perfection we continue to try and we don't get upset that we haven't, because by striving for perfection, even if you don't reach it, what you get is something that is really really good!!!", "Date": "May 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "should have bought one sooner", "Author": "Karin", "ReviewID": "R145TLL9X1FSGF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great and well-priced product.

In fact, I was so sold on it, I decided it would be fun to get back into reading and I ordered one too!!!I have had mine for about 2 months now...  It is super easy to use.  Books download with-in a few seconds.  I love that I can \"browse\" through Amazon's wonderful library in the comfort of my own home.  It's great to be able to read reviews on each book before purchasing. Super cool to be able to see \"inside\" of each book too!

Battery life is good and recharge is quick.The Cons:  One major drawback is that the Android Market is inaccessible by default, so I can't load some favorite apps.

I felt better buying android knowing that I would have a company like Amazon standing behind it. I've had my Kindle Since it came out, November 16, 2011, I think. Today I had my first bit of trouble. The battery is not recognized and will not hold a charge. It took less than 20 minutes VIA chat to have my issue sorted out and a new Kindle on the way. Amazon is great and will stand behind there products. The kindle is great for reading, casual web browsing, and playing games. I love the fact that the browser has flash so I can have the full experience of the web on my tablet. The battery life (Before my Malfunction) is decent. I usually have to charge every 2 days so I can't complain. The screen is very bright and vibrant and great for watching tv and movies on Netflix. Over time, the apps have improved for the Kindle and it just keeps getting better and better. I definitely reccomend that you get one if you are thinking about it. Its great for people who want to try a tablet but Don't want to drop $500 on an iPad. I really didn't find myself missing cameras. I have an iPod and an iPhone that both have cameras so I really didn't see it necessary to have a camera.

Result, I do!!!!  I debated between getting a Kindle Fire and an Ipad.  I couldn't justify spending over $500 on an Ipad when I spent $199 on my Kindle Fire and I got a great deal at Walmart for it.  In February, Walmart had a great special for $199 for a Kindle Fire and you would get a $50 Walmart Gift Card for it too.  I used it to get a wireless router for our apartment.  My Fire is great.  It was already charged and immediately found my wireless router after I set the router up and I was ready to go.  I have a Kindle Keyboard w/3G already and love that and it is great to use with my Kindle Fire.  I love browsing the web.  It is fast.  I have downloaded numerous tv series to my Kindle and it is great to watch from.  Love the free apps.  Love the books.  Just finished the Hunger Games Trilogy.  My kids and I fight over who gets to play Angry Birds on my Kindle Fire.  I have had read some negative reviews but I haven't come across any with my Kindle Fire and I thoroughly enjoy using it.  For anyone who is still sitting on the fence and debating about getting a tablet (like I had been) you won't regret it.  I am not much of an Apple user so I am not familiar with all the apps Apple has but Amazon has plenty of apps for the Kindle Fire and there are sooo many free books you can get on your Kindle.

I waited for while to give a good workout to the device before writing this review.The things I like about the Fire are as follows: It is affordable and functional. It logs onto available wi-fi networks quickly and has really good battery life. The touch screen is very sensitive and made of guerrilla glass. The browser is quick but may take a little getting used to. It can load flash powered websites even if epileptic at times. Video playback is good for Neflix, Amazon Prime Instant Video and other supported video formats. Pandora streaming is good and tons of other useful apps are quickly becoming available for the Fire. Most of these apps are either free or as cheap as $0.99.Now for the things that I do not like but hope that Amazon can change or improve in future models: There is no text to speech and no blue tooth support. There is no expandable micro flash card support. Side loading personal video files can be problematic as many formats are not supported. 8GB is really very limiting for a device that has no expandable storage. Access to cloud storage is not readily available as it depends on availability of wi-fi hot spots which can be spotty at best. Next generation should include an optional 3G model at a different price point and a 10.1\" deluxe version. The speaker is tiny and barely audible even in quiet room. The kindle is too thick and heavy for a 7\" tablet. Next version should spot a thinner bezel.The e-reader on the Fire is not as good as Kindle For PC and the rendition of character can be distracting. Not sure why Amazon is not able to present a more robust reader for the Fire. The carousel catalog system can become unwieldy pretty quickly and abetter system of organizing books is needed.Overall Kindle Fire makes a good entry level android tablet despite it's limitations.", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "I love my Kindle Fire!", "Author": "astevens2", "ReviewID": "R3DLOTS7SGFH11", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent product for traveling entertainment or just relaxing w/o having to take the laptop.

The Kindle Fire fits that bill to a tee. Had it synced with my content at Amazon and with the same content as with my other Kindle in a mere hour. The only reason it took that long is because, unbeknownst to me, my wireless had died on my modem. Otherwise, I'd 'eve been up and synced in less than five minutes. I couldn't wait to get home from work in the morning and try some digital content from the Amazon Prime store.

I use my Fire daily, I'm a college student and have some of my textbooks on the device and it reduces the load in my backpack considerably.  I also connect to the college Wi-Fi system and check email, Facebook, Twitter, etc. from anywhere on campus.

I've installed a new router, but it still won't work, probably because I'm the one doing these installations. When I first set the Kindles up, (mine and my son's) they worked fine on Christmas Eve. A day later they wouldn't work, so I'm not sure what happened.  As long as there is a connection to the Internet, they work like a gem and they are so much fun to download movies onto and especially books.I'm having someone to come in to re-install the router and hopefully that will settle the problem.

Wilson \"M Wilson\"", "ReviewID": "R1DP5INAKQ4MQ5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had my Kindle Fire since Christmas, and I love it.  Because I had a Kindle 3G before, the backlit screen of the Kindle Fire was a bit difficult to get used to.  It is an excellent source of videos and movies, and has absolutely zero lag time with no buffering.  I thought this might be due to my high speed internet connection, but I have checked the WiFI connection in local coffee shops as well as the WiFi in hotels and have had no trouble.  There are tons of Apps to choose from so I don't feel I am missing out on the Android Market experience.  For awhile, however, whenever I read an eBook I went back to my old Kindle 3G, because the pearl ink technology is so easy on the eyes and I could read for a longer period of time.  I have since transferred all of my reading loyalty solely to my Kindle Fire, because turning pages are so fast and downloading is just as fast.  I really miss having the 3G and wish the Fire had this capability, though I understand a monthly charge would be included.  I would just like to be able to use ALL of my apps and view rented movies without being tied to a WiFi network.Also, I would like to see more accessories for the Fire.  I bought tablet cases with keyboards for my children and really would love to have one for my Kindle, but they are not compatible.  It would also be nice to have a docking station with speakers (something like the iPod has) for viewing movies and videos.I have no doubt that Amazon will provide more accessories in the future.  All in all, I have no complaints.  I take my Fire everywhere!!!UPDATE:  There is one particular feature that the Kindle 3G has that I miss very much on the Kindle Fire and that is the Kindle 3G's ability to show the Book Description of books that have already been downloaded.  When I look through my Kindle Fire's library for something to read, I have tons of books and I don't always remember what they are about or why I downloaded them in the first place.  I do not just download one or two books to read.  I download a ton of books to read if they are on the free list and I think I will one day read them.  For books I pay top dollar for, I generally read right away, so this feature is not necessary for those.  I'm certainly not going to send back my Kindle Fire because it is missing this feature, but it would really be nice for Amazon to add it to the next generation...and while they are at it an expandible drive would be nice as well.  Hint, hint.", "Date": "March 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wasn't a big fan of the Kindle before, but the Fire is awesome", "Author": "Carol Abbott", "ReviewID": "R30Y002XMYJ98M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I will admit.  I wasn't a huge fan of the earlier Kindle devices.  While I could see the practical uses, I never felt comfortable holding one or reading one.  It didn't feel like holding a real book, there was no backlight, and the odd delays with page turning were distracting.  However, with a greater variety of uses and the inclusion of Amazon Prime Streaming, I decided to give the Fire a go.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It exceeded my expectations on all accounts.As a Reader:While I do still prefer physical books in many respects, I have grown to like the Fire as a replacement for hard copies.  Using the touch screen to turn the page feels more like a real book, the weight is comfortable and feels like a book, and the backlit screen and options make reading easy in any lighting.  As a migraine sufferer, I really appreciate the invert option for all black pages with white lettering as well.  I can actually read books on most bad days now since the white that bothers me is minimalised.  The selection is quite nice as well.  My local bookstores, for instance, rarely carry whole sagas at any one time, but with Amazon that is rarely a problem. Not to mention the physical shelving space it saves.  The interface is quite easy as well.  The device has prebuilt sections for everything and choosing an owned title to read requires simple tap.  Buying is also easy.  Simply search, tap, confirm, and the title will download.I haven't personally used the device for magazines yet.  I'm not a huge reader of those and all that I do read are on physical subscription through membership discount card programs.  I've had no reason to use that yet.  I do enjoy the comic portion though.  I don't use it a lot, but it is perfectly sized and easy to use then read much like books.APPS:This is the perfect device for many apps, especially game apps.  I've used a phone for several apps such as Angry Birds, but the size of the screen and finicky nature of the screens was always a problem. Not so with the Fire. I've downloaded quite a few titles and have spent hours with many different games, including those that utilise the tilt function of the device.  It is responsive and easy to use.  And if you happen to be a prime member, it seems you can get a free app every so often (might be daily, but I don't check every day I have to admit).  It's a nice incentive on top of everything else and easily helps the Fire become a great device for trips or even breaks at school/work.Video:This was the tipping point for me.  I hate watching things on my computer monitor.  Just don't like it.  So I rarely used the prime streaming service.  With the Fire supporting that service, it was what ultimately tipped my decision for purchasing this device.  And it is awesome.  Granted, WIFI can be touchy at times, but the screen is a nice size and the speakers/headphones give quality sound.  The selection is astounding and the ability to watch on the go is a huge plus.  Again, it is easy to use the service, though I have not purchased any content and only used the streaming abilities.  The interface is quite nice and, if you buy a nice cover, you can set the screen at a good viewing angle without holding it.  The quality is great and the portability is absolutely fantastic, especially if many places around you have WIFI.  Streaming alone is a huge advantage for the Fire, but if you purchase a lot of online content, or even rent, this device might be the best portable device on the market.OVERALL:I have used three of its major functions quite a bit.  The reader is the best out there, the selection of apps is varied, and the video service is astounding.  As someone who wasn't a fan of the Kindle before, I highly recommend this device to anyone that has balked at the less \"book like\" feel of the old kindles and would easily recommend it just on the video and apps functions alone.

I know that this has been compared with the Apple Ipad; however, I do not own one so I will omit any reference of contrast to other products.The product arrived very quickly and was ready to go right out of the box. The screen sharpness and clarity is exceptional. The Kindle Fire is also exceptionally fast. I do not have any lag when I am maneuvering around between books, apps and so on.I am a graduate student and do a sufficient amount of reading, often in PDF format. I loved the Cloud storage where I can download the PDF on Cloud and then send it to my Kindle. If I no longer need the resource on the Kindle, I just delete it and it is still located in my Cloud drive.I thought it might take me a while to adjust to reading in paper format versus an electronic screen, but I was surprised this was not the case. I also love the dictionary feature. As I am reading an article, I might not know the definition of a technical term, which is needed for full comprehension of an essay. It takes me a second to tap on the word and the definition is available. For me, this is a HUGE timesaver. I am often one to use the highlight feature and love this function.There is a good variety of apps that are available. Granted, I am not one to play a ton of games, but the ones I have downloaded I enjoyed. There is also a sufficient amount of games that are free; this is a plus!In terms of free books, most books available are older books. One must also understand that there are copyright issues regarding this factor. The books that are available are plentiful and there are some wonderful classics. With Amazon Prime, you also get one newer book rental per month. I have also purchased books and this quickly accomplished without hassle. Anyone that uses Amazon on a regular basis knows the book selection is comparable to other stores that are solely dedicated to books (i.e. Barnes and Noble).The internet feature is fantastic on the Kindle Fire! Very complex websites are instantaneously viewable immediately and the picture quality is exceptional. I love the social networking and email features as this also serves as a communication device.Therefore, in conclusion, I am 110% satisfied with my Kindle Fire purchase. In fact, my 14-year-old son loves it so much that I will be purchasing one for him within the next week. If I am going to spend $500 ($200 each, plus warranties for both) within a five week time span on any product, then without a doubt, this is testament to just how much I am satisfied with this product.Bravo to Amazon for this amazing product!", "Date": "February 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "no need for a personal laptop on business trips", "Author": "Steve", "ReviewID": "R3J411IFTIZY6O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this system does it all = my Kindle DX books; the new CPT America movie; the first season of The Big Bang theory; Office Pro for Word transferable files; music to fall asleep to or to enjoy while I lose myself in the latest fiction book; and apps - nvr been a big app guy, but Kindle Fire makes it easy!", "Date": "February 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Purchase to Date!", "Author": "Cecilia", "ReviewID": "R2KGJLWL6PDKTR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am so thrilled with my Amazon Fire.

I couldn't put it down, so... I purchased one right there on the spot. I've been reading books, watching movies, listening to music and since I have Amazon Prime I can stream all of this from the comfort of my home or where wireless internet is available. The battery life is pretty good as well. So, far my only complaint is that internal storage is only 8GB. It would be nice if it was more, but I'm okay with it. My son loves it as well. When he's playing some of the educational games, angry birds or reading the books I have to wait my turn. LOL! It's great as an educational tool as well. I'm able to create/edit/view Word, PowerPoint and Excel (with the purchase of a $15.99 application... Quick Office Pro) documents which is very helpful to me when going into meetings.

In fact I have a hard time trying to get him to put it up, he wants to play with it from morning to night. I was also happy to find not just fun games for him, but educational apps as well. I would recommend the Kindle Fire for everyone from young to old. Its easy to operate and very fast, the size and quality are great. I dressed it up with a skin and case to protect it from drops and scratches, and you cant beat the price. In fact just 3 weeks after i purchased his, I also bought another for myself.

My friends and I had all received e-readers as gifts that year, and they were instantly envious. Theirs might have been in color, with a couple of flashy features stuck in there, but they were nowhere near the functionality and dependability of the Kindle. I read tons of books on it without ever having an issue, and it left me wondering what would be next in the Kindle world.Needless to say, this year I got the Kindle Fire.Effortlessly, it has exceeded my expectations. I have played around with different tablets and e-readers before, but never has something caught and held my attention like the fire does. It is literally flawless.The Kindle Fire does EVERYTHING. You can check your e-mail, surf the web, read books, watch movies, stream television shows, listen to music, play games -- all from a 7\" screen. Not only does it do all of that with the most beautiful, vivid picture -- but it does it FAST.If you are trying to make the decision on buying a tablet or e-reader, you really do not need to look further than the fire. Try comparing prices with the features they offer, and you'll be amazed at how far $200 can get you with the Kindle Fire. The only other thing close to comparing is the Ipad, and that's about $300 more than the Fire (and you'll be surprised at how similar).Last but not least, if you're a parent -- BUY THE PROTECTION PLAN! It's around $45 from Amazon, but definitely worth it. It covers the Kindle against EVERYTHING, even ACCIDENTS, for two years. If you're like I am and  a little skeptical on letting your child anywhere near your expensive electronics (or hold your breath and stand behind them while they're doing so!) with the protection plan you can rest easy. I had no idea how many awesome apps and books there are for kids on the kindle, but I'm glad I found them. My daughter, who is six, fell in love with the kindle just as I did. The best thing about it is that there are parental controls you can set; so you don't need to worry about unauthorized purchases or bad sites popping up on your device. If you have a young child, download the Zoodles app as well -- it's free & absolutely wonderful.So, what are you waiting for?! BUY YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND. Or, if you're really generous -- buy your best friend a Kindle Fire!

I take it to the gym with me to watch free movies/tv shows while on the treadmill which makes the time fly (no commercials). Now my 2 year old has taken it over to watch all the free Prime family movies. I even love reading books on it. I've been introduced to several authors that I probably would not have purchased, but via the Prime free books, I read them and loved it. I am a believer :)  This is a wonderful product and for the price, the quality of the video and the convenience of having so much media at your fingertips is awesome.  We have a hotspot hub, so I can take it with me and still have access to the free streaming video when we travel, however, I have purchased several items to download to the device as well.

You don't have access to the Android Market (but it's easy to sideload apps), no microphone or camera (the lack of a mic is one of my small complaints), a somewhat lackluster email client (which you can ignore for one you download from Amazon) and no Bluetooth.What you do get is a fast, capable 7\" tablet that gives you quite a bit!At the start, it's an e-reader.  The e-book reader is very similar to the Android app, but with a few more display options.  A 7\" screen is perfect for reading books on.  Add in fantastic video capabilities and a dual core processor that handles games very well, and it's hard to be disappointed.  It's quite a treat to game on the Fire compared to a phone due to the larger, higher resolution screen.Don't compare it to an iPad.  At less than half the price, you are getting less.  For a power user, you might feel limited at first, but you will soon find that any limitations to Android are very few.My only real complaints are with the apps.  Being a 7\" screen, some run as a tablet app, some run as a huge hi-res phone app, and some run half way in between.  It's far from a deal breaker, however.  The Fire is popular enough that a standard will be found eventually, just as 10\" tablets took some time getting their footing in the display and features of their apps.Overall, I *love* my Kindle Fire and highly recommend it.", "Date": "February 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Have bought 6 Kindles", "Author": "NanaB24", "ReviewID": "R2P2QWMZ1B7OQ1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Last Christmas I purchased 2 Kindles for my grown daughters.

I bought the Kindle Fire at the end of January for the purpose of upgrading from the Kindle 3G. I am an Amazon Prime member and you have to be crazy to use an Ipad with all the free content you get from Amazon. Even the content you pay for is very low in price. As for the device, I had a little trouble setting up my email because the instructions Amazon provides for those using Verizon email is a little outdated. However, all you need to do is find the settings you use for your everyday email and apply them to the email app provided by Amazon. So,if your email is POP3 or SMTP you should have no problem. Also, another minor problem was that the charger supplied was defective after a few charges but Amazon support replaced it for free. While waiting for the new charger the charger for my Kindle 3G worked as well. So, it was not a problem after all. Amazon support is excellent and very responsive. After trying all aspects, it works great. The reader is excellent with back lighting which allows you to read in the dark if you would like. I haven't had a problem with glare but I rarely read outside. The music is fine but I play very little music on the Fire. The video is great. It plays very well and I have been catching up on old Cheers episodes for free. Web surfing is fine. I am able to run interactive stock charts when I review market action at night. I no longer have to sit up at my desk in the late hours to plan for the next day action. Shopping at Amazon is made even more convenient. There are drawbacks such as the screen being too small to update documents or anything you want to be productive but I never intended to do this stuff with any tablet because even a 10\" is too small. The screen size can be made larger by using the device in landscape mode. So, I found the smaller screen size not to be a problem when watching videos or surfing the web. The reader is bigger than the other kindles that usually have a 6\" screen so that's improved. Loading documents was never a problem and the battery life is fine as long as you turn off wireless when you don't need to use it. One last mention about the limited space. There are two modes you can run the Fire with when dealing with content. You can connect to the cloud when playing videos or music so you never have to download the content to the device. Then there is the device mode where you do download content to the device like books, videos, and music. Amazon made it possible to use content without using up space on your device so it's not entirely necessary for the extended memory expansion slot.

I primarily use it for reading or surfing the web while in bed. I no longer have to worry about keeping my husband awake because the lights are on and I want to read. I'm not a big apps person, but I do have a few games on there for my kids. It keeps them entertained when we are stuck in waiting rooms.

After using it for a while, I don't think you can beat what the Fire offers for the price. I work on a computer all day, so I wanted a handheld device I could use to keep up with social networking, web searches, and email that didn't require sitting at anything resembling a desk.When I got it, I wasn't sure I would enjoy using it for reading. I love print books and didn't know if I could make the transition. The brightness of the screen took a little getting used to (and tinkering with the settings) but now I read for long stretches on it comfortably. Some reviewers have complained that the KF sucks up money because you have to buy all the content for it. Yes, Amazon does make it REALLY easy to make purchases but I've had all the content I can keep up with between the Kindle books available for checkout through my library and the awesome selection of free books and apps available from Amazon. In the 2 months I've had my Fire, I've only spent about $6, not counting the Prime subscription.Talking about Prime: I enjoyed my free month so much I subscribed. For only about $6.50 a month, I've got one free book a month through the Kindle Owners Lending Library, free shipping on all kind of products, and streaming video that I can watch on my TV as well as my Fire.Some people have said the Fire is too heavy, but I haven't found it to be any heavier than a hardback book. It's small enough I can toss it in my purse and always have something handy to read. I also haven't experienced any issues with wifi connectivity anywhere I've taken it. Since I stream, rather than download, videos it's storage space is more than adequate. The sound quality and loudness of the speakers has been fine. Battery life is pretty good too. Of course, who wouldn't want a battery that could stand up to high intensity use and not need to be recharged more than once a month but I don't find the 2 or 3 times a week I have to charge it to be at all unreasonable. I've read a bunch of posts complaining about the web browser but I haven't found it to be particularly slow(and I have the cheapest, slowest DSL available). The software updates that Amazon has pushed out have helped with touchscreen responsiveness. Amazon has also worked to increase security by giving the option to password protect wifi access (it's always been an option to lock the device overall).In future updates, I'd like to see an option to password protect one-click purchasing added. If I should want to lend my Fire to someone, it would lose a lot of functionality if they couldn't go online because the wifi was blocked. I'd also like to see Amazon add the ability to create folders or lists options for organizing books.  Right now, my collection is pretty small so it's not an issue although I could see it becoming annoying if I had hundreds of books to go through.I'm thoroughly satisfied with the Kindle Fire and have found it to be a great value for the price.", "Date": "February 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "I JUST LOVE IT SOOOOOOOO MUCH!!!", "Author": "Paula A.

I can check my email at work without having to use my work computer.  I bought stylus pens to use with it as I could not get my fingers in the right place on the screen half the time.  I also do Swagbucks so I can view videos all day with little effort and the battery lasts longer than if I am using my laptop to view those videos.  Swagbucks actually paid for my Kindle so I am a happy camper...The silk browser is fast and I have no issues with that.  It takes a little getting use to the way you view web sites it is not the same as on a laptop or desktop.  I found Pixel of Ink on Facebook so I have many free books.

I read all the reviews and I looked at a friends device but she just bought the fire and had not even registered it so just saw the splash screen.  I was leaning strong to the iPad 2 for a bit there but I don't need the camera stuff and the size just puts me off when thinking of sticking that into my laptop bag.  So I finally when with my guy feeling to get the Kindle Fire.  I'm sure it is just because it is new and my kids don't have 30 village games growing crops but it is way faster at everything than our iPad.  Personal email in fast, work email is fast, web is fast, news stories load fast, Facebook is fast....  And for reading books I think I like it.  I was concerned going away from the eInk and figured I would travel with both devices but I don't think that will be the case at all.

I'm not sure if this is Amazon's or Google's choice as to why we can't register the device on the Android Market but it's annoying and there are no Google apps on Amazon's market. -Glare: I knew this going into the purchase that the regular Kindle devices would be much better for reading so this is relatively minor but it is definitely a disadvantage for reading more than a minute or two.[2] There a few more things I would ask for but for $200 I cannot complain (consider any smart phone user's phone costs $400 + without a contract or discount).  What I find it useful for and like about it: -Battery Life: I've been very impressed with the battery life, I don't really use it a lot at this point, but considering when I do use it and how often it needs to be charged in-between, it has been better than I expected. -Function: This area has been great, it took a little getting used to from using iPod and an Android phone, but the interface works well and I will probably look to spend more time customizing it if I start using it more and find it annoying, but the interface over  and the carousel and favorites work great for now. -Portability (duh): I find that I leave it on the counter between my kitchen and living room so I have easy access and sometimes bring it to the bedroom.  It's great for picking it up and looking at something quickly or checking email.  I have used it between commercials or while talking on the phone, I leave my computers in sleep mode often so now I don't even bother turning them on for quick things anymore because I just use the Fire for it. -Quality: I know some people have had issues but I've not had any freezing or problems with the Fire(I don't pretend like it should work the equivalent of a $1,500+ computer either though).[3] Other miscellaneous impressions/notes: -It was charged right out of the Box (it was registered to the person who bought it as a gift for me but that took about two minutes to fix and change over to me. -Worked great and had it connected to wifi within a minute of opening it. -No problems with holding it or the weight, I'm 6'1\" though so I'm not sure how it scales down.

I debated a long time before choosing an e-reader.  When Amazon added the ability to read library books on the Kindle, I decided to take the plunge.  If I planned on doing nothing else but reading books, I would have chosen the Kindle touch, but I decided to opt for the Fire, and I'm glad I did.ProsEven with the screen brightness turned way down, I can read in the dark without additional light.Kindle books download lightning fast, once I learned to press sync.e-mail was easy to set-up.  I can now read my mail without booting up the computer.Movies stream flawlessly, and I could even read the subtitles on the little screen because the resolution is very crisp.Tech support is swift and responsive. This is a real plus in my opinion.ConsHeavier than Kindle touch, but a cover helps that by making it easier to hold and balance. (I chose the Marware Jurni and have been pleased with it.)Direct lighting causes glare on the screen, but adjusting the angle helps.Some reviews complained about slow screen response, but one day after receiving my Kindle, it downloaded a software update which improved this.  I do notice sometimes I have to tap more than once, but I don't know if this is the Kindle or me.  I did buy the Amazon basic stylus and that has helped considerably with typing on the screen and minimizing finger marks.Battery life is decent.  I was able to stream an almost three hour movie on a single charge.  If all I do is read, I have the screen brightness low and the battery lasts a lot longer.  It also seems to charge in a reasonable time.In the most recent issue, subscribers to Cooking Light in print were offered a free app to download the magazine onto the Kindle.  I was surprised how good the magazine looked and how readable it was on the small screen.In conclusion, I decided that I was a real Kindle convert, when I reached for the top right corner of the Kindle to turn the page.

I was amazed at the color, sound and just plain wonderfulness of the Kindle Fire.  I am finding more and more uses for it all the time and I enjoy it so much.  I have to watch my budget, though, because I want to download everything.  I've never had a tablet or android-type phone before so all of this is new to me.

What I needed was a fast and responsive ereader that I could use to view PDF files. The Kindle Fire does all that, and more. I have an Android Phone so between the Fire and my Phone I feel as if I have what people with iPads and iPhones have without selling out to Apple products. One of the first things I did was download the Amazon market app to my phone so when I log into my Amazon account on my computer I can actually see and deliver even apps to my Fire and/or My Phone if I choose to.Reading PDFs is as quick and effective as reading 7\" sheets of paper. Being able to read my school text on my fire, then pull it up on my phone and it auto sync to the last page I was on is also perfectly efficient. I hardly feel the need to surf the net on my fire (again, it's not meant to be a a replacement for my 15\" laptop or 27\" monitor but I've pulled up youtube to show someone a movie trailer which I used to use my phone for. And after having Amazon Prime for one month I think $79 a year is completely worth it.I did the research, I picked the Kindle Fire for specific reasons and it's lived up to everything I expected of it and more. I have a laptop with a digital camera so I don't need mobile computing or a device to do video chat. I have a phone so I don't need any-where-internet and now I have the kindle Fire that bridges the gap between the two.", "Date": "January 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Works great and Cheap", "Author": "M.

The size was a big reason I bought it, then price, and then just because I really, really like Kindle.I want to be able to carry a tablet in my purse, not my briefcase, and the size of the Fire is perfect for this. As others have pointed out, it can't really be meaningfully compared to the iPad, because they really are different devices with fairly different ecosystems. But for what I want a tablet for, the Fire is perfect.I use it mostly for reading, productivity purposes, and for quickly accessing the web and email. I can do this from my smartphone, but I prefer when possible to use my Fire because the screen is bigger. I rarely play games. I don't stream movies or TV too much, except when I'm in the kitchen cooking since we don't have cable in the kitchen. Note: you do need a high-bandwidth connection for the best experience. We have 20mb cable and it streams flawlessly, but it didn't work at all well when we had a slow DSL connection. I know there are faster DSL connections than we had and I imagine that would work fine too. I do wish Amazon would make the bandwidth requirements more visible so buyers would know up front what they need.I agree with other reviews I've read, that the screen/keyboard is sometimes too sensitive and other times not sensitive enough. It's also inaccurate at times, but I mainly use it in portrait mode, where the keyboard is smaller. I do find that a capacitive pen helps.I don't listen to music on it, I prefer my iPod for that.I check out the free app every day, and have gotten some really good ones. Most of the time the app is a game, but not always. It's a nice little surprise every day.And, the Fire just works. You turn it on and go. I've had it for 2 months and I use it multiple times in a day and I've never had it freeze, shut down, anything like that. It just WORKS. I can troubleshoot things--I do it all the time--but that's really boring and I just want to turn something on had have it go. The Fire does that. Well done, Amazon!Much as I love and use this device I only gave it 4 stars because of the things I'd like to see that aren't there:1. Better battery life. Since I use it so much I charge it at least 1x/day, and often 2x. My Kindle Keyboard I charge every 3 weeks. I don't expect the same battery life from a device like the Fire, but 48 hours would be really nice. If I were taking a long plane ride (like 15 hours to New Zealand), I would take my Kindle Keyboard because the Fire wouldn't have enough battery life.2. Storage card slots. Would be really, really nice to be able to change out tunes, movies, transfer photos, etc. by switching cards. Plus 8gb memory isn't very much if you want to carry movies around with you.3. No easy way to back up work you've done. Several of the apps have the capability of emailing a document to yourself, but still, a card slot would be a useful thing to have.4. Would be nice to be able to purchase external accessories like batteries, keyboards and storage devices that would extend the usefulness of the Kindle.Overall, though, I really like the Fire, it's right up there with my iPod as one of the best things I've ever done for myself.", "Date": "January 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome!", "Author": "Sally", "ReviewID": "R2K92NYXSQRYVD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Awesome!
