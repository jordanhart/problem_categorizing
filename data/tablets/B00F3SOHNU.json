{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Better Than Expected", "Author": "Anfro", "ReviewID": "R3T4NP8MHRA7T6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this Tablet for over a week now and have to say that I am blown out of the water by its performance and what you can do with it! To be fair, there were a few laggy areas when I first got it (day after launch) but those have since been cleaned up by 2 samsung updates. This thing is smokin fast now. I don't really use the \"My Magazine\" app that people are complaining about so I don't have an opinion on that one. But everything else that I use it for is amazing. I really enjoy the web browser that came with it too. I never use chrome or dolphin now.So far what has really blown me away is the split screen where you can have two apps open at the same time side by side. I really love this and do it often. Normally when I split, I have the tablet in portrait mode and have youtube in the top windowpane and the internet browser in the bottom windowpane. But on top of that in each windowpane can have multiple apps that you can switch with independently. I also love the fact you can have a windowed app (select few) that you can move around on the screen while you do others things. For example, I have my bank app up and want to figure out my finances for the next 2 weeks so I use the Spen to open a windowed version of the calculator and just start crankin away. It's awesome!Honestly I don't use the Spen that much for drawing and didn't really buy it for that. I bought it for the beefy specs, build quality, and high resolution screen and have not been disappointed one bit. It is nice to take a screen capture and be able to write notes directly on it though.One thing I think a lot of people are not taking advantage of is an app that comes pre-installed called \"WatchON\". It is a samsung app that uses the IR blaster as a universal remote control for all your devices that use a remote. In the tutorial you set up your tv model the cable you use, the make of the cable box, and voila you have a powerhouse remote experience. Let me tell you I use this every day now. So I open the app to the \"guide\" section and it shows everything that is on tv like your cable box guide. You then select what you want and it changes it on your tv! It's just nice to have a channel on and just peruse though the guide and select what you want without dealing with the cable box guide. You can star your favorite channels and switch between them with ease.  Volume up,down, source, and many other options at your fingertips. I also have my AV receiver that I use for sound set up and it knows to use that for the volume, the channel for the cable box, and the power for the tv. Brilliant! On top of all of that, if you have a newer tv with WIFI direct you can click a button to connect the tablet with the tv and choose to watch whatever is on the tv on the tablet! I was blown away when I stumbled upon that feature! Alert: this app is awesome on football days when you want to switch through the many games that are on at the same time!I'm rambling on here but also you can mirror your tablet to your tv (with wifi direct) and it shows what you see on your tablet on your tv. I played the new Madden game on it and it was flawless.All in all this is a great tablet and I am very happy with my decision even though it was about $100 more than I wanted to spend. It is worth it though. The software you get with this compared to a clean android experience makes it worth it.  I really think if i went to a nexus device from this I would miss all the features and Spen abilities. That is how I know the extras are worth it.I will update this review as things change for the better or worse but right now I am thrilled :)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update 1: Well, I have had this tablet for just over 3 weeks now and it has successfully integrated itself in my daily life :) I thought it would be odd for a while considering I came from the HP Touchpad with android installed. The HP touch pad has a more square aspect ratio (like the ipads) whereas the Note 2014 is more \"Wide Screen\". I am happy to say that I am totally comfortable with the Note 2014 after just 3 weeks. :) I even use it in portrait mode mostly and it feels natural and great. Over all I still love this tablet and it is performing very well.I've been through 3 over-the-air updates from Samsung and it gets faster and faster with each one. The only problem I had with the tablet was that it took a second or two to wake from sleep via the power button. The 3rd update seems to have fixed this mostly but there still are times where it will take a second...one Mississippi...there we go :) But honestly its not that bad. I use the MoKo case for it that I got on Amazon. It has the smart cover that wakes it upon opening so I don't notice a delay that much if there is one. Other than that I am still very happy with this tablet. I'm glad i did my research and waited for this one.Something I didn't really touch on in the original review are the speakers. They are very nice and I love that there are two of them for stereo. They sound very good as well. The HP Touchpad had some pretty good speakers (shockingly) and I feel this tablet is on par which is good and above average in my opinion.In conclusion, I am still very happy with my purchase even taking in account its price. I knew I needed at least 32GB internal storage so it was $600 or nothing :) Keep the questions coming and I will try to answer them as quickly as possible. Later!", "Date": "October 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "This tablet is not for everyone, but those it is for will be blown away", "Author": "J. Bush", "ReviewID": "R3G0A2Q146EVPY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This tablet has entirely streamlined my educational, professional, and personal productivity.  I will preface this by saying I chose this tablet (as my very first tablet of any kind) after 5 WEEKS of research and hours and hours of reading the manual, watching video of reviews, unboxing, customization, how-to's, tips and tricks, and specific software guides. I had the nexus 10 in my amazon shopping cart when I first came across this tablet.  I will nowhere in this review compare this to an apple device- I have never and will never own one- personal preference, I wholeheartedly believe iOS is sufficient or ideal for a lot of people's use, just not ever going to be for mine.  As background, I am in an international DVM program whose laptop just crashed and all 600+gigs of my life were backed up but now only floating in cyberspace so my requirements were a little heady for a tablet-a) deal with extensive editing and review of PDFs, PPTs, DOCs,  XLXS, etc  14-17hrs a day (terms range from 21-24 credits, 4-5hrs of lecture straight, 3-4 hrs of lab with no access to outlet in many labs).  Also when I say edit I don't just mean take notes on I also mean incorporate text, figures, etc from textbooks, websites, and other documents.b) Be a textbook reader and rarely a e-book reader (novels for fun!)  Need to access my extensive kindle library, plus some google books and a few Elsevier/pageburst textbooks. Also this needs to be something I am comfortable and accepting of to literally study off of, enough to give up my previous preferring to only study off of paper/actual printed out notesc) Allow for flawless email, web chat, skype video and text, some web browsing, and file transfer... all on an absolutely horrible school wireless and LAN setup, unpredictable power availability, etc.d) Streaming and downloading of podcasts, video, MRI, CT, radiographs, and ECG'se) Be portable to the clinic and the farms for patient-side transcription, recording, etcf) Get me through the 5-6hr flight and all the airport time!g) Occasionally watch videos/listen to things for funh) Most importantly, due to a dominant hand injury, multiple surgeries, and continued required hand therapy/rehab, I am currently able to write again but not to type with that hand.  I therefore wanted a tablet that was stylus intensive- not just for notes, but for navigation, etc.  THIS is what made me give up that wonderful squeaky clean android OS of the nexus 10! (I still thing that is probably the best thing for people that want an android tablet but don't NEED a stylus) So my tablet arrived flawless and flawlessly.  The display is beautiful, if anything the screen is too bright- I'm aware my eyes are light sensitive so this won't match with the majority of people but if I do turn my brightness on at all I don't believe I've ever gone above 15%, though I'm sure there will be some case videos poorly and darkly shot that I may need to in the future.i) at least temporarily, replace my laptop and download and have as much of my backed up laptop files as possibleThe tablet was quickly populated with the apps from my HTC phone and google account.  The account set up for everything was quick and easy.  The initial 2 updates were completed with no adverse signs. Navigation was great, no lag, and I quickly cleared out the stock widgets, set up my panes, and then went into settings.... I activated Developer options and did some customization and disabling there, but most of the disabling I did in app manager, device, and controls.  There are very helpful guides out there if you're not sure which apps are safe to disable as well as a \"Guide: Longer Battery Life- How You're Being Robbed on XDA that takes you step by step in maximizing your tablet.  It was not created at the time when I cleaned up mine but it would've helped greatly!Here is the gist.  The tablet comes crammed full of software and capabilities that I don't need or want.  The My Magazine app, a lot of the touchwiz stuff, the eye movement sensors(smart screen), the hand gesture stuff, reading mode, voice control, motions/palm motions, all of that is just a constant battery drain and I will never use them.  They were disabled and the vibration feedback for everything was also turned off.Battery Report:  This tablet was shipped within the US twice, and was brought internationally on a plan 4 days later.  It was accidently left on the ENTIRE time for about 8 days with six apps up on standby.  It arrived with 18% battery left.  I use it for 15-17hours a day and end up having to charge it 2-3hrs per about ever 24hr period to get it back to 100.  I can use it while it is charging and it will still positively charge during use.USE FOR A STUDENT:  It has replaced textbooks, laptop, printer, scanner, and painstakenly editing and customizing notes and making documents for me.  Disclaimer: as someone who used to be able to type 130+ words per minute, I'll make perfectly clear, if you prefer to type and plan on typing a LOT tablet touchscreen keyboards SUCK.  This is a fact of life.  You can get used to them, you can get proficient at them, but you'll still probably hate it and you're going to need a physical keyboard case/add on if you do a lot of typing of documents or emails.  Now, this tablet is made for a stylus.  This is not just a peculiarly edged simple piece of plastic that you can buy for just about any touchscreen device and kind of use as a writing device.  This is the s-pen, a WACOM and this device and stylus is designed to maximize the experience so you are writing or drawing digitally with an experience just like on paper.  Examples- the harder you press the more solid and thicker your pencil/pen/brush/highlighter/calligraphy/etc line.  The button on the stylus brings up air command which can be super helpful and it also allows quick screen shots. The stylus allows for fine website navigation that allows you to open drop down windows etc as mouse would.  It also offers things a real pen/pencil cant- selective erasing, and selection for drag/drop/copy/paste of ANYTHING to ANYWHERE.  You're typing notes and see a great figure and text on a website, you can freehand or rectangular circle what you want and put it into your document. Then you can resize/edit.  It's great.  I've been using the Snote app for everything thus far, I have made short futile attempts with Lecture Notes and Evernote but I couldn't really get anywhere.  I'm not going to give up on then, I just need to research them more to see if I can eventually get them to do what I want and then I can compare them to Snote.USE FOR A PROFESSIONAL: So far, this has been wonderful.  I can seamlessly take notes, look up references, voice record my exam findings, and awkwardly as only a tablet is, take video and pictures of patient's during an exam for later review. (Extremely helpful during lameness and neuro exams for the file).  Collaborative documents through Polaris office and google drive is exceptional- as fast as a laptop and more portable, and better screen size than a smartphone. It runs better than the school computers for running presentations off of onto projectors.  I can also have students I tutor digitally sign- literally our weekly sheets and submit them via email with one step- completely negating the awesome printer and scanner I brought down here.USE FOR A CONSUMER:  I find this tablet beautiful for watching movies and videos and the sound is great.  In a classroom of 50 people chatting between classes I have no problem hearing the speakers among the hub but there are completely valid reports that even cranked the sound might get lost a little if you're in a very loud close crowd.  Sound improves with earbuds but the initial audio set up app (basically a hearing test and then a customized audio scheme for you) was startling when it compared the stock/base line settings to what it came up with for ME.USE FOR AN ARTIST: I'm still learning and adapting, I'll never turn to this instead of actual physical art supplies and paper but it is fun and I can really see myself doing more digital than before.  It has been especially nice for graphic design, photoshopping, etc.USE AS A LEFTY: no issues except see below for one thing that affects both right and left handers...ISSUES:  1) One day after about a week of ownership, my battery was in the upper 80's, I was taking some notes and about 2hrs later I looked at the status bar and it was 29%.  I went into Battery in Settings, and the s-pen interface was responsible for 80% of the battery use.  I shut down and then restarted and it's never happened again.  Similarly the Android OS did the same thing at a later instance but again it was a one time thing and in both cases the battery recharged speedily after and stayed charged.2) Snote- I have had weird episodes where an import fails, or it force closes itself repeatedly when I try to rename or change the cover of one particular document.  After this erratic behavior occurred twice in three days and completely clearing and restarting Snote from scratch (everything backed up and replaced on my Samsung account) to no avail, I did a factory reset.  The last \u00be of my ownership have seen no such problems any more.  I will warn you that if you wipe out S note and you start from scratch in it and re-transfer all your SNote files back in, if you have a lot of really big files, it can take a really long time to re-populate.3) The menu/return and physical home button- occasionally based on the desk I'm at, if my arm isn't supported and my wrist is resting fully on the edge of the tablet, these buttons will get pressed while I'm writing.  Its purely an annoyance and doesn't affect the writing or do anything but I definitely have to reposition if I find I'm getting lazy on holding my wrist up at these desks.Wrap up: I only use in landscape, it's just like writing on a portrait piece of paper except you can also zoom.  I got used to writing on the tablet and the tiny stylus very quickly but there are compatible Samsung styli of various widths and sizes out there as well. I thought about waiting for the new 12.2 whose screen is literally a full piece of paper landscape, but I realized this is perfect for me and more portable than the 12.2 will be (this thing can just squeeze into one of the pockets on one of my lab coats.  I was planning on having to use the Nova launcher to avoid any lag but truly, this tablet was a speed demon already and I eventually got Nova solely for the customization ability and cleaner interface.  It allows me to avoid more things I don't use and I didn't lose ANY of the software I do.Bottom line, RESEARCH! PREPARE! And there will STILL BE A LEARNING CURVE! But it will be based on discovering unexpected cool features instead of on frustration).  If you won't heavily use the stylus, don't spend the money on this tablet.  If you're just curious if you could \"get into a stylus\" try one out first but prepare first so you can use it to the full advantage while you're there.  Also, I came from NO tablet and no Samsung/Note experience and there are changes between the previous model and this.  You don't actually lose much but things are moved around and different.  Don't be scared to optimize it, I'm not talking rooting, though adventurous forays into that terrain have finally arrived as well. In conclusion I love it, it has made things so much more efficient for me, I get a lot DONE with it and it's basically all I have to carry around.  I purchased the 32gig tablet plus a 64gig Sandisk XC which installed and worked like a charm. There are annoyances that come up but any issue I have had I have been able to fix. I have everything safely backed up on Carbonite and there's a million ways to sync all of your accounts if you chose (note some of this may be unnecessary or frequency can be dialed back too)It performs and looks beautiful and I am still learning.EDIT: FLASH PLAYER: This tablet absolutely supports flash. Youtube and embedded flash worked right out of the box, however, to watch my amazon video's etc, I just downloaded the following file- I cannot post the actual link but it's a drop box file. Install this and make sure flash is enabled in your browser settings/plugins and it will work in the stock browser, Dolphin, and Mozilla. Some people also recommend having your browser set to View Desktop site.Edit 12/15/2014: Please see my comment under product question- \"Can you use amazon prime video on the galaxy 10.1 2014 ed? asked by Judith C.

I just wanna say that this now support multiple users!! This is awesome and I'm so glad Samsung came through with this feature.Pros--Screen- Wonderful color representation and clarity, Eye candy.-S-pen- such a nice stylus, works like a pen, a tablet and stylus really belong together like this!-Speakers- Beautiful sound, surprisingly clear and crisp, just a pleasure to listen to. (watched the avengers a couple clicks below highest volume and it was definitely adequate)-Speed- One of the quickest tablets I've used, it has recently gotten an update that increases the speed of touch-wiz getting rid of any previous stuttering. The gpu in this is a beast capable of a lot of things that some of the next gen chips can't do like directx 11 and full Gpu computation.-Sturdiness- Feels very well built, haven't had any problem, although plastic it is very sturdy and doesn't \"feel\" plastic. The faux leather back is quite nice, and a welcome change of pace however it is just molded plastic I'll say so you don't get mislead.-Battery Life- This will have enough juice to power a heavy user through the whole day. I have done a test on 25% brightness with WiFi on continuously. In this condition it lasts 10hrs and 43minutes approximately. This was under heavy network usage, and the usage was about 4hrs of video, 1hr of gaming, 2hrs of drawing, 2hrs of web surfing and about the last 2 hours buying and installing stuff. This was with power-saving mode on I believe.S-pen air command functions:-Action memo- take a quick note and link the information your wrote to something.-Pen Window- Basically, an overlaying window that is surprisingly reminiscent of windows on, well..., windows. (Works with only seven apps currently though)-Screen write- Take a screen shot and write on it, not sure what it's good for. Maybe to annotate a website or an E book.-S Finder- Search your content, and the web for whatever your looking for. (draw a symbol and search it, or an equation, although it might not always know what kind of equation you want it to be.)-Scrapbooker- Basically collect content from the web, or anywhere and throw it all in one place for you to have easy access to.Cons--Touch-wiz is definitely not as easy to use as stock Android, once you get used to it though it isn't at all bad.(edit: I have really begun to like this version of touch-wiz, it has some things reminiscent of stock android but gives it a new spin, but it might not be for everyone)-Expensive, but worth it if you are going to use the features.-Cannot record 4k video, honestly 4k isn't going to be mainstream for awhile and it's not something that is missed as this can record 1080P which is very high quality.-The packaging was weird hah, was very secure though.-Not sure what else to put as i can't honestly think of anything else that is troublesome.(i will update though as i have further use of the tablet)If you have any questions please comment.", "Date": "October 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Loving it!  Here's a few tips... (Follow-up)", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"richlife\"", "ReviewID": "R3E3LTQOYH9KQW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Update 1/11/2014:  I just want to add a tip that someone gave me in a comment to another Note 10.1 2014 review. In the review that follows, I complain that Android is not really conducive to developing and editing spreadsheets, That's true ( .for me at least), but the tip was to work spreadsheets with the tablet in portrait position rather than landscape. That really does help.Update 12/3/2013:  First of all, I've downgraded my rating to 4 stars -- for the same reasons many have commented on.  I just don't find the problems to be as large or as tedious of some do and I get a lot more benefits from my Note 10.1 than I have issues, so I would really say a 4+.The biggest issue is that the Note hand writing translation is not anywhere near perfect and does actually have a few naughty problems that will at times slow you down.  I find you need to learn how to \"write\" on the note.  For example, it has difficulty between my \"i\", \"l\", \"/\", and even \"'\" or \",\".  As I get more meticulous the better the result.  My \"tt\" is done with three strokes, not four.  The Note seems to have learned how to handle that.  (Good!)  Stray spaces or overwrites tend to happen and mostly surprise me and require correction.  But at times the Note just correctly interprets the same input.  (Strange!)So for me who uses the Note to communicate with others (not just to take notes for myself) and who tends to perfectionism on spelling and punctuation, there IS a certain amount of frustration and correction that I shouldn't have to do.  (I should point out that 45 years ago in college, I learned to print FAST because I couldn't read my own writing when it came time to review/study.  I haven't tested Note with my writing, but frankly, I shudder.)So why a 4-star review?  I love it.  With some minimal correcting, I generally get what I want properly entered with the s-pen and I feel no need for a real keyboard despite being an excellent typist.  I MUCH prefer the s-pen over poking the screen keyboard.  Those who complain about lag, even with TouchWiz, clearly are not getting all the Samsung updates or may have other issues.  (Incidently, as a new Samsung user, I LIKE TouchWiz and have not felt a need to replace it.  I also just got a new Samsung Galaxy S4 and naturally there is almost no learning curve.)  Despite TouchWiz, Android 4.3 is simple Android 4.3.  Don't bother me with complaints otherwise.The screen is great, the size is perfect for me (where the Nexus 7 was just too small), the feel is good and after 3 weeks I still don't understand why people complain so vehemently about accidentally pressing fixed button or soft keys.  Some adaptability in life is a good thing.  I won't say that accidental key presses have not happened, but no more than using my 6 year old laptop (still getting occasional use).The speakers puke, but that's why I bought a Logitech Bluetooth Speaker for my Nexus 7.  I use my devices for music access, not for quality sound.  You need to find your own sound quality.  A photographer or a smartphone owner may not want to use the onboard camera, but it is definitely useful at times with reasonable results.My other use for a Note is for woodworking design.  The is no replacement for Sketchup -- that's the only software for which I need to find an Adroid option.  However, some limited use of the S-note and Sketchpad have been very promising and hand drawings are basically how I start everything and sometimes the only thing I use.I'm a retired programmer/project manager and now have only an irregular need for a full computer system though I have been dependent on a PC and then a laptop for more than 30 years until 3 weeks ago.  My laptop still suffices when needed, but I've hardly used it at all since getting the Note.  My biggest issue is with the extensive spreadsheets that I would like to be able to use, edit and update on the Note.  Spreadsheets in general are not well supported by the Note software (or any other Android software that I have found). Spreadsheets are not pure text input and Samsung or someone else should provide a \"Cell Based\" input means that doesn't cover half the visible spreadsheet with an input area.  So there is some spreadsheet utility, but at this point, I still must go to the laptop for major updates.I don't see that as particularly a Samsung problem although they could (and should) certainly provide the solution.  The Android spreadsheet software is just lacking for advanced work.  Most of the FUNCTION is there, but as I said, the interface is weak.  This typically would only affect me about 3 - 4 times a year.  My spreadsheets have 10 years of development and use in them for budget management.  I can still see my results (including the graphical analysis) and do limited inputs with what is available on Android.So this spreadsheet limitation is the ONE item that prevents ME from COMPLETELY replacing a Windows based computer with the Note 10.1.  It may not work for others, others may feel more limited, it may be necessary to adapt to new software and techniques (cloud usage) but I am very satisfied with the Note.  Improved S-pen software and a good spreadsheet interface, would complete my requirements.I've never been an Apple user though in my technical days did involve early Macs.  I'm in the camp that the the iPad bigots should \"get over it\".  If you like your device, fine.  It's not better than mine for my purposes -- I like to be able to manage my own device.(It suddenly strikes me to say that MY usage has almost NOTHING to do with media entertainment.  Interesting!)(Begin original thoughts:)It's hard to add any to the good reviews that have already been made, so mostly I'll first recommend that you read the first 5 - 8 reviews under the default \"Most Helpful First\" sort.  At the end of this preliminary review, I'll add the many suggestions I collected from reading ALL the reviews and comments -- that should help some of you who are new or still trying to learn.  And I strongly recommend that anyone watch the 48 minute YouTube review that I have posted as a comment.  There is more good information and orientation in that video than you'll find in maybe any other.Despite some dissenters on this idea, I'm using the Note 10.1 as a replacement for my venerable Win7 on Sony VAIO laptop.  The laptop is beginning to show it's age and wear after 6 years.  Still runs better than my wife's new Lenovo Twist with Win8.  I've been using a Nexus 7 for the past year and this Note is much nicer.So related to this laptop replacement, one question I have up front is whether any of those who rate this tablet at 5 or 4 either have or plan to get a bluetooth keyboard to use with it.  At this point, I'm not in a rush, but as a typist, a keyboard CAN be nice.  For me, the keyboard would stay in my living room like my laptop does -- I definitely will use the Note and stylus for portability and convenience. (Edit:  You can get a keyboard, but I now don't think it is necessary.)The most difficult concern with this tablet is it's complexity (I've commented about this in a number of other reviews).  After that concern, there is a nice \"feature\" that got in the way -- once you follow the introductory setup, if you already have had a tablet, the Note will go out to Google and/or Samsung and start downloading your configuration and apps.  Nice (it took several hours to get all mine from my Nexus 7) but interferes with getting the new updates from Samsung.As others said, there are currently three updates which eliminate the lag and add multi-tasking.  If your new Note is clean, you will have no issues with doing a factory reset after getting those updates as some recommend.  But if you spent hours getting your apps in place, you probably won't want to start again from scratch after a factory reset.  Despite that (wanting to be sure I had the best possible performance) I decided to do the factory reset -- after all it was just a matter or waiting for all those downloads again as I hadn't really done any special customization.In the end, I found that doing the factory reset didn't seem to provide any better performance for me -- it was great before and after with no lag.  I suspect that those who did get an improvement had not downloaded all 3 updates before they did a reset.  Can anyone confirm or deny that?  (Edit:  Max posted agreement with this.  Thanks, Max.)So now I'm into seriously configuring this thing.  Since the Nexus 7 doesn't have a memory card slot, all my apps were downloaded into the Note main storage.  Any suggestions on what and how to best transfer stuff to the 64 Gig microchip?  I assume some apps will run better from main storage?  I plan to put all my data, music and pics on the microchip.I'm not having problems or lag with Touchwiz, but I'll try another launcher and post about that later.  (Edit:  Not sure now that I will actually bother -- TouchWiz is fine for me.)So that's my preliminary rating based on the fact that everything I've done and tried out has gone well and the device itself appears to be in perfect condition.  I'll edit this in a couple of weeks to update my experience, but up front, I TOTALLY disagree with the review that complained extensively about the poor build quality.  Sure it's plastic, but the fit and finish is great.  NOTHING appears to be loose or vibrates.I also want to comment about the experience I had with Amazon on the shipping.  UPS completely screwed it up and reported the tablet as delivered on time even though I never saw it.  The first Amazon CSR seemed to get things all taken care up, but I didn't get any followup.  After I called back AGAIN, the support team worked together to first of all ensure I got to someone who would take care of the problem and each person involved took responsibility to see that the handoffs were completed properly.  Not ideal, but I got my Note 10.1 with only a small delay.___________Ok, these are the suggestions I gleaned from the reviews and comments of others.  Feel free to use or not as you choose -- these items are copied as found from different people so they are a bit disjointed and redundant:NOTE: There is an UPDATE from Samsung dated November 1 that adds MULTI-USER and resolves most of the sluggishness issues. Go to Settings/General/About Device/Software Update to get it. Mine did not automatically update.If you continue to have issues, you should do a factory reset after installing the newest update for the device. To check for updates manually, go to about device in options.Before you start using the device, I highly suggest doing a factory reset after you've updated to the latest firmware.If you are still complaining about lag, I would recommend downloaded a custom launcher like Nova Launcher.NOVA is good, but I've always liked Apex better.  With Apex, I turned on \"Tablet UI\" mode, which makes it look like stock Android (no bottom bar, no dock, app drawer icon in upper right, square-outline tablet animation for panning desktop, etc). I love stock Android so for me, Apex in tablet-UI mode is great.After getting rid of Touchwiz (for shame Samsung) and putting Nova Launcher Prime on it, it ran great.Cons: Samsung overlays android with their system touchwiz. It has its good but it has its bad like major Memory hog. I'd recommend using one of the launchers such as nova launcher for a more customization of an experienceUSB Host is one of the most undernoticed features of Androids and is in my opinion one of the best features compared to iPad lines. What this means you get a USB Host cable also otherwise called OTG (On the Go) cables and plug in your USB thumb drive or other USB devices and the device recognizes it. Another much ignored feature is the TV-out (via MHL A/V link). Unfortunately the 7\" does not support it whereas 8in and 10.1 in supports it. You can connect Galaxy devices to a TV to make it truly a fantastic computer if the device supports MHL. Throw in a Bluetooth keyboard and it is awesome.Google Music (Awesome, I have now upto 10,000 songs halfway through Google's 20K Limit)For flash capabilities, I use a web browser called Dolphin Browser, there are others out there for flash capabilities, but i prefer Dolphin for its speed and stability. After installing Dolphin browser which allows flash player to be enabled, I've essentially turned this tablet into a laptop in terms of internet web browsing capabilities. To allow the Dolphin Browser to have its Flash option work, you must download an Android 4.0's version of flash on the tablet, anyone version will do. Google Android flash player archives and proceed to the Adobe site. Flash has no longer made anymore updates for android devices, therefore you must do it this way. Go to dolphin browser, hit menu, hit settings, turn on flash. And now you have flash capabilities on your Dolphin browser, no other browser has flash capability as of now. I must tell you it is a pleasure to watch Amazon prime videos using the dolphin browser, and at the same time multi-task with another browser like chrome to read stuff on the internet or use S Note on the right side while watching a video for class on the left side.LAG ISSUES CAN BE IMPROVED, READ HERE:  -------------Turn on developer options by tapping \"build number\" found in the \"about\" section within options 7 times. Once developer options are turned on, scroll down to window animation transition animation, animator duration and turn each one off. You will notice no more lag for scrolling and exiting apps.To solve the home button issue where there is lag, go to S voice. Once in S voice, hit the menu button which is located left of the home button. Choose the option to \"not initiate S voice by double tapping the home button\". You will notice considerable changes in speed of the home button to wake up the screen, however it won't be snappy until there is an update.In addition, the more apps you have on your device, the more cache data your device will accumulate. Just like your web browser, you should remove your app cache data once a day or every few days to save up space. I suggest AVG memory and cache cleaner, or clean master.  -------------Tips to extend battery life, go to the wifi options and select to turn wi-fi off when device is asleep. In addition, turn off GPS located by networks in the network location options, turn on GPS only for location.-The Touchwiz gallery app is TERRIBLE, it draws thumbnails every time you open the app, so if you have lots of photos, it hangs/lags sot bad that it can render the device unusable.[I use QuickPic and it handles everything fine](For people that dont have 4K+ photos you will still likely need to disable weather/buddy tagging, dropbox photo displaying, Google+ photo syncing/displaying, Facebook photo syncing/sharing and clear the app cache for the gallery to get decent performance from the stock gallery)??? If you have the Galaxy Note phone, transitioning to this tablet is super easy in that the user interface is practically the same. And once you link your Google account, it automatically downloads all compatible apps to your device for you. You'll still need to download Amazon apps individually- but you'll need to allow downloads from \"unknown sources\" to get them.I will say there are some things you won't discover right away; settings that are buried in other menus and menus that you discover in apps after days of using them.Many application features are difficult to discover. Always press the menu button, just in case!Turn off the news/home button association by pressing the menu button while the news is on screen. You'll see the option to turn it off there.The S-Note can go into what I'd call \"Note-Only\" mode, meaning neither menu bar nor tool bar shows, only the 100% pure note, so you can literally use it just like using a regular note.(After going into the edit mode) With 3 fingers tab on the screen holding onto it for about 1 second and then release, and it will go into that note-only mode, and write freely without having to worry about accidentally touching a menu button, and then tabbing with 3 fingers on the screen twice will exit you out of that mode (back to the regular edit mode).I've only had it a few days and the first thing I did was download Nova Launcher, program it to \"remote\" my TV and to prevent possible lag went into \"Settings\", \"General\", \"About Device\", tapped \"Build Number\" 7 x's. This opens the \"Developer Options\" tab, then under \"Drawing\" turned OFF \"Transition Animation Scale\". You can go to YouTube and watch this tutorial presented by TheDigitalDigest. Great series of helpful tutorials for tablet neophytesTo learn more about the Note 10.1 2014 Edition, here is a link to a YouTube video on Samsung Mobile's page:[...] .  [Even better to me, this is the long, thorough review that shows almost everything there is to know:  [...] .]", "Date": "November 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Why I returned my Ipad air and purchased the Note 2013 Edition", "Author": "Mark H. Weiss", "ReviewID": "R1UR3PZTN5YPWK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It was a very difficult decision to return my iPad Air and order the Note 2014 Edition.  There are plenty of reviews that address the functions of the and features of the Note 2014 Edition, what I will address the key areas that  made me move off the Apple platform.For background I have been an iPad user since the beginning, I have loved the design, function and application portfolio of the platform.  What I have not liked was the closed environment of of IOS, I find it frustrating to run all my content thru iTunes and the difficulty and sometimes inability to move content from the iPad to other platforms.(Yes I know about Dropbox and cloud services but that still requires additional steps and still doesn't enable certain content to be easily moved))  It is incredibly easy to sideload content to and from the Android platform enabling me to share my content across all of my android devices.Aspect Ratio - I read a lot of printed materials (newspapers/magazines) on my tablet,  initially I favored the 4:3 aspect ration of the  thinking that it enabled me to read the text of a full page without expanding.  Even though (in landscape) the 16:9 ratio on the Samsung is not is wide it turns out to be wide enough and better fits the length of display required for both newspapers and magazines.Expanded Storage -  In the current release of Android you have the capability of running applications off of the MicroSD card effectively expanding main memory.  Note in early release of android you could only store content on the microsd.  I was always very frustrated at the cost that Apple charged you for storage-  For an additional $45 I have been able to expand my 32gb congfig to 96gb - note- you'll want to use a micro SD card the read/writes ar 30mgps like the Ultra series from SanDisk.Printing - This is a definite strength of the iPAd/IOS platform.  The print function is built into the operating system enabling you to print natively.  Printing on the Note is a bit kluge and requires third party apps like cloud print, HPePrint and others. than on Android Applications -  It is no surprise that more iPad applications are optimized for the larger screen.  Android still seems to be a phone based operating system that works on larger devices.  From the aesthetic perspective this in not a problem for me, video content from Netflix, HBOGO, Xfinity and Youtube look just as good on the Samsung Note and the did the iPad Air.  I get less wowed that my weather widget doesn't jump off the screen.  However one of my favorite magazine applications Newsstand does not run in Android.  This is that app that consolidates electronic versions of the print magazine you subscribe to.  Currently note of the publishers of the magazines I subscribe to have a native android app.  All of the aggregation apps like Plus or Zino would require a second subscription which I am not willing to do.  Big negative for me.S-Pen -  This is a key reason to purchase the Note.  I love to take down phone numbers and have them immediately published to my contacts file or to-do to my to-do list.  Using the S-Pen with the multi-taking capability is incredible, it enables you to asclosely as possible emulate what you can do on a powerful laptop.  Major feature/capabilities advantage for the note.Swift-Key/Swipe - This is the best way to input onto a virtual keyboard.  I hated typing on my iPad after sywping on my Samsung Phone. Swiftkey is an even better implementation along with it allowing you to resize and relocate the keyboard.  Major advantage for the Note.So to net it out, they are both great tablets but the ability to expand storage (cheaply), easily move content to and from the platform, multi tasking, swyping and the S-Pen made the decision easier for me.", "Date": "November 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "SUBSTANCE and INGENUITY- Not Just \"AIR\"  ---now has MULTI-USER !", "Author": "anzicco", "ReviewID": "RI1ECL1ST763L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been using the new Galaxy Note10.1- 2014 now for about three weeks ever since I traded in my aging iOS device, an iPad 3.I am blown away by the beautiful Ultra HD display which far exceeds any clarity and color of any tablet I have seen!  Blows retina away!The S Pen let's me be \"naturally\" creative as I would with a pencil on paper, as it responds well and handles almost flawless to transcribe what I write as text into typed text from taking notes, to searching in the URL box, to the new ingenious Twitter application that let's me write or draw tweets! The ability to open multi windows is a great new experience from the decaying stagnant features on my old tablet. Not only can you open two apps and work between them at the same time, but you can also open two windows with the same app such as 2 websites or 2 emails... and you can even draw another window, or 2, or 3 on top of those windows to watch youtube or bring up a calculator and more!The one gripe I have is because of its advanced specs, some of the software, especially touchwiz related items, does not seem to be optimized for these higher specs and tend not to run as smoothly as they do on the S4 or Tab3. There are also some game apps that falter or slow down for some reason (like Simpson's Tapped Out) when they work fine on my other Galaxy products. I don't know if they just haven't been updated for android 4.3 which is standard on this device or if they just can't keep up with the tablet's specs. I hope Samsung releases an update to speed up these issues, and that Kit Kat 4.4 is planned for this monster of a tablet soon!I highly recommend this tablet. Samsung makes it easier to switch from other formats such as Apple's iOS to android than some of the other manufacturers that just give you vanilla android.I made the switch earlier this year when the S4 was released and it was a lot easier than I thought it would be...I did not lose functionality or choices of productive apps, but actually gained a lot more and also can customize my device to reflect my taste, not some hot shot designer in an IvEry tower telling me the way my device should look and function.  You can also expand this device's storage by an additional 64GB with a micro SD card!HIGHLY RECOMMEND this tablet for anyone who likes to be creative or productive and enjoys the freedom to have the additional input that the S Pen provides!********************NOTE: There is an UPDATE from Samsung dated November 1 that adds MULTI-USER and resolves most of the sluggishness issues.

That being said, having an Android device, especially a Note 10.1 2014 has its benefits:-Customization of home screens with android widgets (see google).-Air View, Smart Scroll (leave off when not using to save battery), Smart Stay (leave off when not using to save battery).-Micro SD card for external storage up to 64 gigabytes.-Downloadable music, video, document files right off the internet that gets saved to your device(external or internal) and easily accessible through the general video, gallery and document apps on the device.-Ability to download third party apps not found on the google play store, such as paid apps. (Does not require your device to be \"jailbroken\" like the iPhone/iPad.-much more benefits,Note: If you buy the Note 10.1 2014 you get over $600 in perks. This means $25 google play store money, $50 for Samsung hub to download entertainment, 2 years of 50gb of Dropbox storage free, 3 months of Hulu Plus free, Audible for 3 months free and several more other offers.Before you start using the device, I highly suggest doing a factory reset after you've updated to the latest firmware.Comparing this tablet to the newly released iPad Air, this tablet is much for capable in terms of multitasking and performance. iPad Air has 1gb of RAM, whereas the Note 10.1 2014 has 3gb of RAM. There is a noticeable difference in better performance speed in running apps and graphic \"smoothness\" compared to other tablets out there like like iPad 4 (not sure about ipad Air). More importantly, this extra RAM allows the Note 10.1 2014 to multi-task very well and I am referring to the \"multi-window option\" which allows split screen between two apps (Apple does not have this on the iPad) so you can operate different apps side by side at the same time. In terms of screen real estate, they are about the same however the note does have much more pixels (see specifications). The note is longer but shorter, while the iPad is taller, but not as long. The reason one may buy this tablet is for the S pen feature and its highly customized interface.No other tablet in the market has an S-pen that is advanced than the normal pens you use for touch screens. The S Pen has a button and when clicked on, it initiates air command which lets to choose options to take notes,save portions of the screen, write on a screen shot taken, etc (read all about air command). The accuracy of the Samsung screens is much more accurate in terms of pointing at words with your finger and especially your S-pen on the Note 10.1 2014 which is shown by research, if you google Samsung screen accuracy.For flash capabilities, I use a web browser called Dolphin Browser, there are others out there for flash capabilities, but i prefer Dolphin for its speed and stability. After installing Dolphin browser which allows flash player to be enabled, I've essentially turned this tablet into a laptop in terms of internet web browsing capabilities.

Great case, with auto sleep/wake when opening or closing flaps and a great feel/look.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Downfall for this tablet (currently), hopefully an update to fix will be out soon.Known issue of slight lag in the interface/home button while browsing around:Touchwiz is known to cause this issue(the interface program for Samsung Galaxy Series).LAG ISSUES CAN BE IMPROVED, READ HERE:Turn on developer options by tapping \"build number\" found in the \"about\" section within options 7 times. Once developer options are turned on, scroll down to window animation transition animation, animator duration and turn each one off.

Just like your web browser, you should remove your app cache data once a day or every few days to save up space. I suggest AVG memory and cache cleaner, or clean master. Also I highly suggest you install an anti-virus software like AVG on your Note 10.1 2014.Tips to extend battery life, go to the wifi options and select to turn wi-fi off when device is asleep. In addition, turn off GPS located by networks in the network location options, turn on GPS only for location. I suggest if you do get a defective Note 10.1 2014, return it for another one.But hey, for the innovative features you get on this tablet and especially the high customization you get it is worth it in my opinion. iPad's and iPhones have been nearly the same every year after each years new release.A good tablet contender would be the Surface 2 in terms of pricing, which is actually cheaper right now, but does not include a type cover.The pro's to the Surface 2 would be an almost identical Office Suite, the RT version of a windows 8 desktop and tiles, close feel to a laptop and built in flash player.The Con's would be a very limited HD screen, that is about 208 PPI, low market share and only 100,000 Apps on the windows store.In my opinion using the type cover with the Surface 2 would be almost like using a small laptop, which I personally think takes away from the term of what a tablet actually is. I might as well use my small laptop with windows 7 installed to do my office work. I dont plan to replace my laptop with a tablet. However if you rather have a tablet-like experience with something you are very familiar like windows, then the Surface 2 may be the way to go.", "Date": "November 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Finally, a tablet that thinks with you and not for you.", "Author": "Beantown Reviewer", "ReviewID": "R1F623L69UAQEZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been holding off on jumping into the tablet game as every tablet out there was just another vehicle for access to entertainment and \"intuitive\" decimation of information (which I think mostly means without human thought or involvement).  While entertainment is great, my tvs, phones and laptops had that covered.  I'd been holding out for a device that could do something those others didn't already have covered.  A device that combined time - tested methods (handwriting commits things to memory like typing or finger tapping can't) with modern information and productivity.  This tablet is that and so much more.As a researcher, I need something that can handle hours of reading and annotations, mind breaks into magazines and Web searches and space to customize as my needs change.  No other tablet offers that level of flexibility.  This tablet does it beautifully (literally the screen is awesome and the function is unparalleled).  It's worth every penny.  The battery life is great, in the few days I've had it, I've had no problem going 2 days without a charge.  It's very comfortable to use in both viewing orientations.  And,  if you download the manual, you'll realize how unlimited the capabilities are.  The S pen is awesome as well and there has been no learning curve to convert it to text.  I use it all the time and haven't found areas of incompatibility.Basically if you've been looking for a device to think with you and not for you, that truly adds to your tech abilities instead of replicating what you already have, buy this tablet.", "Date": "October 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best right now", "Author": "Neteru1920", "ReviewID": "R20K38MRU6LHDZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So I'm sort of a technology junkie so I have iPad and iPad mini, nexus 7 and a galaxy note 8, surface pro(which is a pc not a tablet) and I have to say the Galaxy Note10.1 (2014)is my go to tablet right now. I really needed a solution where I can take notes grab articles from the web and multitask.

I was looking for something that I could bring around that would have access to all of my documents and data (google drive) and also something to take notes with in class. This thing is perfect. I have all my books in PDF form so Im bringing around this little guy in my backpack instead of 200 pounds worth of paper. Reading with this thing is a delight, the screen is nice and sharp. Whenever I want to make notes I can do so right in the PDF viewing app, and can review my notes later when studying for tests.Also the stylus is perfect. I'm 8 weeks into classes and already gone through 3 notebooks worth of scrap paper from solving physics problems and such for my classes. (No homework is actually collected, but if you don't do it you'll fail - so its all \"scrap\" paper essentially) With this tablet I can solve problems on the screen and save them for later if I want to study the material. Everything is nice and organized as opposed to my notebooks.In addition to that you have all the normal tablet functions and such yada yada, but hey this isn't a tablet that you'd buy because it can do tablet things.

Save your money and time.  I purchased this tablet with the hopes of using it as a desktop replacement - and using with a keyboard and/or mouse. Any/all Bluetooth devices drop on this tablet.  I have upgraded it to version 4.3 .  Doing a search on the internet reveals this is a systemic issue for the 2014 model. When calling Samsung tech support, they claim not to know it is an issue - however, they will tell you it is a software issue and to 'wait for the update.'  They cannot provide any time for the update...and aren't the ones publishing it.  Too bad - this thing is a nice product otherwise.  I will comment that my Bluetooth devices work well with my Galaxy S4 and other Android Devices.**UPDATE **After speaking with Samsung customer service, they continue to deny there is a problem with the 2014 units.  However, per the customer service rep, Samsung pulled their planned Bluetooth keyboard (he saw it in Beta) - and commented it was quite unusual for Samsung not to have released a keyboard by now.  I published a negative review on the Samsung website about this issue - only to have it pulled from the site.  Shame Shame Samsung for releasing a product with a defect like NO reliable Bluetooth for key'd & mouse. I also am not sure I can attribute this is an Android issue - I have other 4.3 devices *namely a 7\" Nexus tablet* running 4.3.  And that unit works GREAT with various Bluetooth keyboards + mice.

But the fact is the Note 10.1 2014 is the best tablet yet from Samsung, with advanced specs and a state-of-the-art stylus that make this device a worthy competitor to Apple's iPad Air.The biggest selling point of the Note 10.1 2014 is its advanced stylus, called \"S Pen\", which should benefit those who handwrite and draw a lot.  The 10.1-inch touch-screen doubles as a Wacom digitizer board that senses pen pressure and displays pen stroke thickness accordingly.  The S Pen also \"talks\" to the Note tablet: if you hold the tip of the S Pen close to the screen, the Note will sense its presence and automatically disables the touch-screen, so your hands won't accidentally touch it while you are writing or drawing.The S Pen has a fine-point tip that allows precise interaction with the screen.  The tip is  replaceable if it gets dull over time (search Amazon for \"S Pen nib\").  The tip is short and thin, but the end of the tip is round, not sharp.  The Note tablet has a pen holder at the corner for docking your S Pen, so you won't lose it so easily.Samsung doesn't offer a comparable, pen-less version of the Note 10.1 2014.  The other  10\" tablets from Samsung, Galaxy Tab 10.1 and Nexus 10, both have less advanced specs compared to the Note 10.1 2014.  Wait for the rumored upcoming release of Nexus 10 2013 edition, which may have better specs such as the latest Android OS 4.4, if you want just a vanilla 10\" tablet.  Or, if you prefer iOS, get an iPad Air.S Pen is obviously for those who draw and/or write notes a lot.  But if your notes consist mainly of text and you mainly type your notes, then probably any tablet or device will do.  If you need handwriting recognition for text, there are already apps with such ability made for regular tablets, so you don't necessarily need the S Pen.  Rather, the Note and its S Pen are best for people who HAVE to handwrite and draw.  They are for those whose note-taking involves a mixture of words, symbols, and drawings, or any type of activity that necessitates handwriting or drawing.For instance, the S Pen would be useful for students who take notes in class, professionals who make quick visual notes, or anyone who needs to jot down any info that isn't only text.  Useful scenarios for the S Pen include designers who need make some quick drawings, mathematicians writing down equations, writers of East Asian languages who may find it more convenient to handwrite than using complex input methods, or anyone who needs to make a lot of handwritten annotations on pictures, documents, etc.The S Pen's handwriting recognition for text is supported system-wide.  Wherever the regular keyboard pops up, once you take out the S Pen from its holder, the Note immediately changes the keyboard to a writing pad that recognizes your writing.  This only works if you specify the default Samsung keyboard in system settings.  If you install and use third-party keyboard apps, this will not work.The S Pen's handwriting recognition for SHAPES, however, is supported only in a few apps.  By \"shape recognition\", I mean the Note will turn your rough drawing of a square, circle, or any recognizable shape into a perfectly drawn shape.  This results in neater and more presentable notes.Three bundled apps are able to recognize hand-drawn shapes.  \"Polaris Office 5\" is able to recognize simple 2-dimensional shapes only: squares, triangles, stars, etc.  \"S Finder\" is able to search for symbols you have written in your notes, but sadly this only works for 5 symbols: star, circle, heart, question mark, and smiley face.  \"S Note\" is a powerful app that links to your Evernote or Samsung account.  It recognizes 2-dimensional and cubic shapes more accurately, and also lets you edit them more easily.S Note is a richly featured app that recognizes handwritten text of all languages, shapes, and mathematical formulas.  It lets you tranform (and undo transforming) handwritten words to real text that can be copied and pasted elsewhere.  It lets you transform (and undo transforming) handwritten mathematical formulas into PNG image of properly-typefaced formulas.  It lets you resize any part of your note when you run out of room on a page.  You can change colors of any object.  You can even adjust the thickness of the pen strokes already written.  You can use the eraser to erase any portion of your note, down to individual pen strokes.  You can also choose different pen styles: ball-point pen, pencil, caligraphy brush, hi-lighter.  You can customize pen color, thickness, and even set pen presets.  And of course, there is S Pen's ability to sense pen pressure and draw thickness accordingly.  Every action is undoable or redoable.  Most importantly, the plethora of features work really WELL.Needless to say, Samsung did a great job with S Note, which really shows off the S Pen's capability beautifully.  This will probably be the most used app for many who buy the Note 10.1 2014.  As I said, all notes are linked to your Evernote account.  If you use the Evernote app to view or edit your S Note creations, you will be taken automatically to the S Note app.But the excellent S Note lacks one good feature that only \"Action Memo\" has.  Action Memo is another bundled app for note-taking, but it is a much more primitive compared to S Note.  While it recognizes handwriting, it does not transform.  Handwriting stays as is.  It lacks many advanced editing features found in S Note as well.  But Action Memo has the unique ability to perform actions on your handwriting, such as adding your handwritten name and phone number to your contacts, sending an email address directly to a new email composition, sending an address to the map app, or sending a search word to a browser's search field.  Of course, you could just open up the individual contacts, email, map, and browser app and make your entry there.  Hence, this feature's usefulness is somewhat suspect.  Other than this lone capability of Action Memo, I think most of you would use S Note most often instead.The S Pen costs thirty dollars should you need to replace it.  Make sure you get the one specifically for the Note 10.1 2014 tablet, so it will fit into the pen holder.  Do not buy the one for the Note smartphones, nor the one for last year's Note 10.1.  Samsung's website shows that only the black S Pen is available (part# ET-PP600SBEGUJ).  Hence, owners of the white edition of Note 10.1 2014 need to make sure they don't lose their white S Pen.The S Pen itself has a button that launches the \"Air Command\" menu, which lets you launch any of 5 apps: Action Memo, Scrapbooker, Screen Write, S Finder, and Pen Window.  Sadly, S Note is not among them, and the Air Command menu is not customizable.Scrapbooker lets you free-hand \"lasso\" any image on the screen and save it to the \"Scrapbook\" app.  This is essentially just a screen-capturing function that also lets you cut out only the part you want.\"Screen Write\" lets you capture a screen and write on the image afterwards.  The bonus in doing so is that words written in this manner are SEARCHABLE by S Finder, provided that your writing is legible enough for recognition, and that the words are written on solid backgrounds with color that contrasts nicely with font colors, so that recognition is more likely.You can screen-capture the traditional way by pressing the Home and Power button simultaneously.  Captures are saved in the \"Gallery\" app, where you can add writings to the pictures.  But writings made in this manner are NOT SEARCHABLE by S Finder.  Apparently, words are not \"indexed\" here, thus making them not searchable.S Finder is the \"global search\" function of the Note 10.1.  It searches contacts, visited webpages, note content, help content, handwriting created in S Note, Action Memo, and Screen Write, and online content via Google as well.  As I mentioned, it also searches for five symbols: star, circle, heart, question mark, and smiley face.  You are supposed to use these symbols to tag your items, allowing them to be searched more easily.  But as I said, 5 symbols are just too limited to be useful for such a purpose.\"Pen Window\" is a multi-tasking, multi-window feature.  It opens up a small window, lets you choose another app (which must be one of the built-in apps such as Calculator, browser, etc.) which will then open up in a smaller window on top of your current app.More useful is the ACTUAL multi-window feature, which works like this: you open up a tab on the left of the screen, choose an app (which must also be one of the built-in apps), and it will run SIDE BY SIDE with your current app.  You can share info between the two apps by dragging and dropping, if both apps allow it.  This is useful when, for instance, you are composing a document in Polaris Office and you need to drag a picture from the Gallery app to the document.The Note 10.1 2014 has voice recognition as well.  Whenever the Samsung keyboard or writing pad appear, there is a button for voice command, which functions for any language you select.  It works pretty well also.  Technology has advanced to the point where voice recognition works pretty well for everyday vocabulary.  Of course, you may not want to do this in a crowded environment where other people can hear everything word you enter.  You may want to turn off the keyboard tapping sound as well, which also helps to conserve power.Regarding battery power, the Note 10.1 2014 has a few features that drain power and may even overheat the CPU.  I installed the third-party app Android Tuner to monitor the CPU's temperature.  One day, I was shocked to see that it went up to 70-80\u00b0C, which is too hot even for desktop CPUs.  I turned off the Note's \"palm gestures\" and \"smart screen\" features and the temperature went right back to a normal 30-40\u00b0C.  \"Palm gestures\" let you take screen captures or pause video playback by moving your palm in specific ways, and they don't always work.  \"Smart screen\" is supposed to let you motion your eyes to perform certain basic tasks, but again it doesn't work reliably.  Better to turn these features off to save battery AND the CPU.---COMPARISON WITH IPAD AIRChoosing between a Samsung tablet and an iPad may come down to whether you are a bigger fan of Android or iOS.  In terms of apps, both operating systems offer many of the same apps in their respective ecosystem.  There are some notable differences in OS features, however.Android lets you enhance the home screen with \"widgets\", such as stock market ticker, weather tracker, news headlines listing, etc.  Both Android and iOS let you install third-party apps to enhance your home screen appearance.Both Android and iOS let you install third-party keyboard apps.  iOS comes with East Asian keyboards with handwriting recognition.  Android doesn't, so you need to get third-party apps for that.Many Android devices come with a microSD card slot so you can add extra storage.  With iOS devices, the only way you can get extra storage is to pay a hundred dollar more to get the model with more storage.The micro-USB port on many Android devices can connect to external USB hard drive with the necessary cable.  The micro-USB port on iOS devices cannot connect to anything other than iOS accessories.Former iOS users who are new to Android may be disappointed that Android doesn't have the ability to let you tap on the top of the screen to return you to the top of the page.  You have finger-scroll all the way up.Also, Android does not have audio notification for sent email, the way the iOS email app does (the \"swoosh\" sound).Here are some comparisons specific to the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 and iPad Air:In terms of looks, the Note 10.1 2014 has a shiny, silvery outer edge that makes the device look quite cheap, and a faux leather back cover that looks even cheaper.  iPad Air has a sleek, clean look, and an aluminum body that is beautiful to the eyes and great to the touch as well.  Both devices are the lightest 10\" tablets available, weighing slightly over a pound each.A blessing for some but an annoyance for others, the screen of the Note 10.1 2014 is wider and shorter than iPad Air's due to its 16:10 aspect ratio as is the case for many Android tablets, while all iPads are in 4:3 aspect ratio.  A wider 16:10 screen benefits those who watch movies and TV shows, since most of today's shows are shot in wide-screen.  A 4:3 screen is better for photographs and reading, since 4:3 is the common aspect ratio for photography, and a printed page (typically letter size 8.5\" by 11\") is also close to 4:3.Both the Note 10.1 2014 and iPad Air display in very high resolutions that exceed 1080p HD resolution: 2560x1600 for the Note, and 2048x1536 for iPad Air.  They enable the shooting and viewing of high-quality and detailed videos and photos.The Note 10.1 2014 supports the latest Wi-fi 802.11 \"ac\" protocol in addition to a/b/g/n protocols, while the iPad Air only supports a/b/g/n.  \"ac\" supports greater frequency, range, and data rates.  But routers that support \"ac\" are currently more expensive.The Note comes with 8MP rear and 2MP front cameras.  Both allow you to shoot videos at 1080p or lower, at 16:9 or 4:3 aspect ratio.  You can shoot stills in 16:9 or 4:3 ratio as well.  The rear camera also has LED flash.  The camera app also lets you set a timer.  In comparison, iPad Air has 5MP rear and 1.2MP front cameras.  The rear camera only shoot videos at a fixed 1080p 16:9 format, and the front front camera at a fixed 720p 16:9 format.  Both cameras only shoot stills in 4:3 format.  There is also no LED flash nor timer.Some iOS devices do have LED flash, like iPhone and iPod Touch.  In iOS 7, the LED flash doubles as a flashlight as well.  Note's LED flash is just a flash.The speakers on the Note is noticeably louder than the iPad Air's, but you need to adjust the audio with an equalizer app to get better sound quality.  With headphones on, both devices have similar audio quality.The Note has two speakers on the left and eight sides, both pointing away from you instead of towards you.  You may need to cup your hands around the speakers to redirect the sound towards you, sort of like cupping your hands around your ears to listen better.", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "An Interesting Twist of Events", "Author": "Blake", "ReviewID": "R1LI7MI8O59X8O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As a self-proclaimed \"Apple\" guy, I was very skeptical of getting a Samsung product. I am so used to operating Apple's products such as my Macbook and iPhone, but all things considered, the iPad is basically a larger iPhone, and I wanted to mix things up a bit. Therefore, I took a huge chance on the Galaxy Note. At first, operating the tablet was difficult because the operating system was so foreign to me. That being said, it did not take long at all for me to get used to this device and its absolutely outstanding features.The speech recognition works incredibly well when searching the tablet or verbally inputing text. Also, one of the main features of this tablet, the S pen, makes this tablet easier to understand thanks to the Air view features which, when hovering over certain icons with the S pen, gives a useful and brief description of the icon on the screen. The S pen also allows artistic users to write/draw personal notes and artworks, as well as write to input text.  The battery life lasts for a while and does not take as long to charge as other tablets that I have had experiences with (i.e. the Nexus 7 and Apple iPad). The multi-window feature makes multitasking simple, and the accessibility options make the tablet's operations more personal and convenient to each user's standards. And of course, Samsung's \"Smart Screen\" features only further increase the convenience of this tablet. Why take the time to pause a video when you can just look away? If you are, for instance, reading with a tablet, the screen timeout may beat you before you can flip to the next page, but with Smart Screen, all a user has to do is continue to look at the screen for it to stay active. Various motions and voice commands also make this tablet wonderful to navigate. Don't feel like hitting the snooze button on your tablet's alarm? Just say \"snooze\" or \"stop.\" Samsung has integrated so many useful features into this tablet.While the Note 2014 edition packs a punch with its features, fear not- It also has wonderful aesthetics.  The packs are made of a sturdy plastic material with a leather-bound look.  The screen images are typically extremely clear and almost lifelike.I personally worry about storage often due to my love of music, pictures, and applications. I purchased the 32GB Note 2014 edition, but should I run out of storage space, it is comforting to know that I can easily remedy this issue by inserting a micro-sd card into my Note.With all of these wonderful aspects in mind, I have found a few minor flaws with the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 edition.  On a few occasions, my tablet has briefly frozen or randomly returned me to the home screen. Also, integrating my music, photos, and contacts from my computer was a bit of a hassle at times, and it took me some time to finally get everything settled. Those flaws being said, I could almost always Google any questions or issues that I had to find a solution. If I could go back, I would undoubtedly purchase the Note over an iPad. It just has too many amazing features and characteristics that put other tablets to shame.", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best tablet out there", "Author": "JC", "ReviewID": "RKLI0QZKRLE8H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is currently the best tablet on the market. But I would say you need to be a little bit higher than a novice to get the most out of this tablet. If you want a tablet to surf the web and play Angry Birds, this tablet is NOT for you.The multitasking abilities is just unmatched, no tablet comes close, it will be interesting to see what the Surface 2 looks like but the Windows tablets are pretty far behind in terms of app development etc.The digitizer (SPen) experience is again unmatched, sure you can buy a stylus for the iPad, but it doesn't have the same experience.NOW, for all those people complaining about lag. The unit doesn't lag much for me other than the magazine app which has a lot of visuals it needs to load and when your in this app you should be just browsing slowly anyway.If you are still complaining about lag, I would recommend downloaded a custom launcher like Nova Launcher. This tablet SCREAMS with the Nova Launcher, the best thing is you DO NOT lose any functionality with the Nova Launcher even though your not using Touchwhiz. For example the multiwindow side bar is still there when you use NOVA along with the Air Command features. All still work, only thing that doesn't show up is the swipe up feature to get into my magazine.Overall, no tablet comes close, the Ipad is easier to learn out of the box, where as this tablet may require a few tweaks but overall the features available on this machine, coupled with the impressive hardware and beautiful screen makes this tablet well worth it.Update 10/18/13I just discovered another feature, the tablet has an IR blaster at the top of it so you can use it as a remote control for your TV or digital box. It comes with a great WatchOn Samsung app which is great, you can actively look to see what is on right now in a guide and then click the show on your tablet and the tablet automatically changes the channel on your TV, even works with older non HD style TVs, this is a really nice feature.", "Date": "October 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Productivity bar none", "Author": "Radim S", "ReviewID": "R11T8CAU4JCF4T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am laughing when I hear people say iPad is helping their productivity.

The resolution is just amazing.  At a  2560x1600 the resolution is the single biggest improvement over previous generation which was just 1280x800.  I was blown away with the resolution.Compared to previous model, size has reduced a bit, weight decreased a bit, and memory of 3GB is so good. Battery has bumped up to 8220 mAh. There is no other tablet on the market with such an integrated S Pen system, and for this alone this is a terrific buy. If you are someone who has to take notes on a frequent basis, the 10.1\" 2014 edition is a great buy. If you browse TV shows, you tube videos on a regular basis this is again awesome. If you are not into lot of note taking, you should not consider this. This model's cousin the Tab 3 series is apt for regular use. Again I did not use the last generation for its low resolution. This model trumps it all. My only wish is the weight and price could have been even lower. At 1.26 lbs it is not the lowest in the market. With iPAD air at only 1 lbs, it is sure to have competition. But I am a fan of Android and the use of back button, and I like the Samsung series for that reason.64 GB SD card is awesome! With prices plummeting for 64 GB cards, it is a great boon. Put all your music, books, photos on the SD card and you have a powerful computer in hand always! I personally use the 64 GB microSD card on my mobile devices. Get this mobileUltra (SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 6 Memory Card with SD Adapter - Retail Packaging.I tested OTG capability and it is great to have a external USB support.  USB Host is one of the most undernoticed features of Androids and is in my opinion one of the best features compared to iPad lines. What this means you get a USB Host cable also otherwise called OTG (On the Go) cables and plug in your USB thumb drive or other USB devices and the device recognizes it. I have used it with Alfa AWUS036H for a wireless project with Android PCAP Capture from reputable Kismet wireless.  Another much ignored feature is the TV-out (via MHL A/V link). Unfortunately the 7\" does not support it whereas 8in and 10.1 in supports it. You can connect Galaxy devices to a TV to make it truly a fantastic computer if the device supports MHL. Throw in a Bluetooth keyboard and it is awesome. Leo Laporte's TwIT TV which is Internet based show has one full episode in Know How on covering this topic. GPS was spot on and I tried multiple GPS apps. It was bright outdoors (had to crank the brightness all the way up). I personally use Navigon from Garmin and have downloaded several apps.I tried following apps and they just worked awesome. A tablet is only as good as the apps you have and how productive it makes you. It's almost like the camera/lens analogy in the DSLR space. What good it is to have a great DSLR body if you have no good lens? Same with Tablet body and apps you have.WolframAlpha (I can go on for hours praising this.

I do a lot of reading and really wanted the resolution and either device would have been fine. Honestly if it wouldn't have been for the hardware issues of the 701 I probably would have ended up with it, and I will probably end up getting a bluetooth keyboard for when fast entry is required.First let me say that I am not your normal tablet user. I don't just surf facebook, the web, and play games, although I do those things I use my tablet as a business tool as well. I create weekly reports, my email load is much higher then most, it is my organizer of my thoughts (evernote rocks!), my source for research and reading most things with Kindle, Olivetree, and various other sources. So with that said I was very leery to step away from a tablet with a keyboard, and that is still on the fence. But I will update as time goes on.Now about this tablet....I want to address all these reviews that are complaining about \"lag\". I guess I would really question what version of the tablet they were using. I have about 250 apps installed with things like email, facebook, evernote, calendar syncing all the time and I have only seen one stutter which was caused by a software update in the background while I was trying out s-note. Otherwise this tablet absolutely crushes my daily tasks. I would say if you get one of these the first thing you should do is make sure it has the latest updates which is done simply from the tablet with little fuss by going to Settings -> General tab -> about device -> Update. Most of the time the device will automatically update itself. I am currently running build JSS15J.P600UEUBMK1 and it is really smooth.My Tablet is and 32 Gig model with an added 64gig MicroSD in the slot (Sandisk Extreme 80mb/s)Reasons I chose this tablet1) Microsd expansion can actually be used to store applications and data (thank you samsung) unlike most other android distros. This is the one thing that keeps me from buying a Nexus device. I do not like the push to fixed internal storage, have we learned nothing over the past decades of technology. No, online storage is not an option that can replace a fast sd card. Yes the 701 has the expansion however it can only be used for data (music, videos, misc files etc.) the 701 will not allow you to move apps and app data over to the SD unless the app is specifically programmed for it (unless you root the tablet which voids the warranty). This may not be an issue for you but it is for me..2) Performance - both tablets have staggering performance but the Note comes out a little ahead.3) SPEN - this could be more of a gimic then a useful tool time will tell however the fact that I can capture and scrapbook the screen or websites or whatever I want is extremely handy when trying to communicate with people. This opens up so many possibilities. The key will be to recognize/learn about those functions and use them, otherwise you might as well forget about the SPEN4) Size - for a 10\" tablet this thing is really a compact, thin, and light package. It make my TF300 feel like the original Compaq \"portable computer\" for those who are old enough to remember that (Kids google it) and battery life seems to be as good as my tf300 so far... I have only had about 24 hours with the device and the first day is always extreme use due to the install and setup procedures.5) Multitasking - Android has always been able to do this, but it's multi-use was limited by the interface. Samsung has figured out a way to implement this in a way that works very well. Most people may not use this but as a power user I appreciate the possibilities.6) 3 gigs of RAM - this means that this tablet will not be outdated within a few months. Plus for multitasking I can see that this will probably be needed.7) standard charge port - this one always annoyed me with the TF300T. Manufacturers TAKE NOTE (ha) standardize your power connections. I understand it is more difficult for the transformer line however there are ways they could have made the port more standard. I grew tired of not being able to charge my tablet when I was away from home. The Note 10.1 2014 model has gone back to a standard style micro usb charge port. The stock charger is a 2Amp rate charger and most Micro USB chargers these days are 1Amp chargers which will charge the device at half speed however it will charge. With my Asus I was out of luck if I ran out of charge.Here are my impressions of this tablet.- Speed - OMG Wow... coming from a TF300 the Note 10.1 finally feels like a tablet that keeps up with my pace. It's fast those who complain about stuttering I would be interested to know what they are referring to.- Screen - The brightness is amazing even in full sunlight. The clarity, resolution, and colors are stunning. I cannot imagine how we could ever get a better picture then this. There are no signs of pixelation anywhere the text for reading books or websites if simply as clear as I have ever seen. NOTE: BE WARNED.... this screen will suddenly make you want to  upgrade all you computer screens and TV's the crystal clear text will spoil you.- Battery - Yesterday I got about 7 1/2 hours of heavy use of downloading(gigs of data), installing, and copying data to my tablet. (That's actual screen on time according to the battery monitor) I have no doubt that I will get 10 hours of reading at moderate brightness levels.-S PEN- I was not expecting it to be quite this useful. I have no doubt this will re-invent how I use my tablet and take notes. I use Photoshop Touch a lot and it is SO MUCH BETTER WITH A PEN!!  The screen capture / scrapbooking functions are awesome. Note taking is responsive and useful. Handwriting to text, well... the jury is out.. I can type twice as fast as I can write so I'm not sure how useful this will be, after all I have had a keyboard in my hands for... Let's just say a lot of years.- Touch WIZ - I heard a lot of bad things about this, and it's not as bad as I thought. I may(will) replace this in the future, I do like stock android. I will probably root this device eventually, because I can never let \"well enough\" alone LOL. But that is not because of some performance need. Has more to do with the bloatware which brings me to my next point.- Software - This is a mixed bag. all the spen software is mostly well designed and fully functional. The latest version of Polaris Office is included which I am eager to try out. KNOX is crap (look it up if you don't know what it is) this is probably the single reason I will choose to root in the future. WatchOn, Samsung's IR remote software seems like a good idea, but it is designed for non techie's. It is very limited in its selection of devices, why not allow you to custom select and program buttons. If you don't know what rooting is and don't customize your devices then you probably won't care about these apps. Honestly, they don't seem to take away from performance, but I am too much of a control freak to allows these apps to run on my hardware. YMMV- Design - for a 10\" tablet it is small very thin. This gives me the feeling that this thing is fragile. That's not reality, as the Note is built very well with no flex. But I am going to be nervous in transport until I get the case and screen protectors that I ordered. This is one concern I never had with the TF300T since I had the keyboard from day one which makes it self protecting.Summary - The most awesome screen I have every held in my hands. Comparing it to my wife's Nexus 7 (new version) I think the colors are actually better on the Note 10.1 (but that is subjective). Performance is simply awesome. Having 96gigs (32 internal + 64 microsd)of usable storage is great. I will still probably get a Bluetooth keyboard as I do a lot of text entry. But the onscreen keyboard is one of the best (not close to tactile though). Very happy with the purchase.Amazon Warehouse Deals - I purchased this from Amazon Warehouse Deals.  The description on amazon said that there are scratches on the device and the packaging is messed up. Honestly there were no scratches, and the only sign of packaging damage was tape over the factory seals. For a savings of over $100 from retail I am extremely pleased with the purchase. But I guess that depends on the back story of the tablet.", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "A tablet packing a huge Punch!", "Author": "David Cave", "ReviewID": "R3TS4S3VLDBN3V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am pleasantly surprised by how smooth this tablet performs after booting up and installing three updates and especially after reading all the negative reviews about this tablet.

The note just seems to be eons ahead of the ipad which seems more intent on media consumption. I think they are both great tablets but the note is better value for money in my opinion. The expandable memory and ir blaster which the note has further extends the difference in function between the note and most other tablets.Using the note heavily for the last few days I would recommend it to anyone who is in the market for a new tablet!", "Date": "December 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Go paperless with Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition (32GB, White)", "Author": "D. Pennie", "ReviewID": "RWBKPGQW7VOQ4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Update 5/6/2014:I have now had the Note for 5 months. I have been using it almost daily, especially in my work life. Samsung has finally pushed out the KitKat firmware update and all my lag-type issues are now gone! I am THRILLED. I knew it being a new product when I purchased it that there would be some issues to work out. Samsung has come through like I hoped they would. I have left the rest of my review as it was originally. However, please note, I would not want to give it 4.5 stars any longer. Samsung's amazing product and it's follow-through with firmware updating has definitely earned it a full 5 star rating!Original review:I have had my Note 10.1 2014 for two weeks now and it is everything that I wanted it to be, and more. I had been waiting to buy a tablet, because I wanted one that would help me go paperless. I didn't want one just to surf the web, watch video, or to do all the things on it that I can already do on my smart phone. I wanted more from a tablet, and specifically that was paperless ability. If that is what you want in a tablet, this is the one for you, too.Other key requirements for me were multitasking ability and stylus usability. The multitasking works pretty well. I'm a huge picture-in-picture fan, and now I can do it on my tablet. Phenomenal! There is no better stylus than one that is fully integrated into your tablet like the SPen is with the Note(s). You can use the stylus instead of typing on the (horrible like all others) tablet keyboard, to write instead of type and have your writing converted to text. This is by far my favorite thing about the Note. I *hate* using tablet keyboards, and now I don't have to!Note taking:I take all my notes for meetings, calendar entries, phone call messages, everything that I would have previously used a pen and paper for, now on my Note 10.1. It has required a lot of trial and error to figure out what app I wanted to use the most, which worked best for my needs.Learning curve for the device:I have been spending a lot more time on Android forums, specific to the Note 10.1 2014, finding out features I was not figuring out on my own. I watched a lot of youtube tutorial videos when deciding on whether to get the note, and knew there were features used in those videos that I could not figure out. There is a learning curve with this device. You have to be willing to put in some effort to really get everything out of it.Not pure Android:I also used forums to discuss changes that have occurred since updating the tablet upon arrival (Android 4.3, Kernel 3.4.39-2040736). Some features are lost or glitched after updating the device, and while that sounds bad, it hasn't been a huge issue. The awesome Ripple Effect that was present on the default lock screen when I first got the Note is now gone and no longer an available feature. This is a disappointment, because it was a neat feature that, simply put, made the display look amazing when unlocking the screen. Obviously, this is just cosmetic. Another issue I'm having is with unsetting a default that I accidentally set. When you navigate web pages or apps sometimes you're prompted to use another app, say for viewing a photo outside your browser for example. The Note will ask you if you want to \"always\" use the app you choose or if you want to use the app \"just once\". I found out the hard way that \"just once\" is the better option, because if you choose \"always\" for an app, that can cause some issues that no \"Default app cleaner\" app can fix. This is also not a huge issue, because in my situation it's causing another cosmetic detail issue (I can't change which app I use to crop wallpaper or lockscreen wallpaper photos now), but it is still a minor annoyance and could cause other more irritating issues had I not learned the lesson quickly and on a minor thing. All of these things are software update bugs that should or will probably be worked out over time.Other things related to this not being pure Android is the relative slow loading speeds. I wouldn't call the device 'laggy', but there is a noticeable delay whenever you try to load anything. And I do mean anything. It's the norm, and a lack of delay is the rare exception. These days, this is not something people tolerate well. I have been using computers for almost 20 years, and have experience with days when systems were *extremely* slow. I think I have more patience for a slower system that others do, which is part of the reason why I went ahead with this device. I knew and expected it to be a little slower. You should too, or you might find yourself a little irritated. It isn't an extreme thing, but it is noticeable.These issues are always a risk you run when you get away from pure Android. If you have any concerns about software bugs like this causing you too much frustration, you should consider a Nexus or an iPad, as they are 'pure OS' experiences. This is Android with the Samsung software slapped on top of it. There's going to be a few bugs along the way. Not to mention it just came out two months ago. As an IT professional, I should have known not to update so quickly after getting the device, but also I am more tolerant, because my expectations are rational.Overall:If I could give the Note 10.1 2014 a half a star less, making it 4.5 stars, I would purely for the slower functioning and glitchy updates, but I went into the purchase expecting those things, and for that reason I gave it a full 5 stars, because it is meeting all my expectations and exceeding them in other areas.

I've been using the S Notes to take hand written notes and have been excited to see how well it looks like actual hand writing. I can also write very small and the tablet will still recognize what I write. It pretty much mimics the paper and pen very well. The only down side with this is that I take notes with tablet while it's in a horizontal orientation. Thus, I have to scroll down once I fill up the screen. This is not a big problem since S Notes uses a program that will only recognize the stylus for writing so you can use your finger to easily scroll down the page while taking notes.The Tablet keeps up with your writing very well. It also can sense pressure.I've looked at the Windows 8 tablets like Surface Pro 2 and Thinkpad Tablet 2. They also come with a stylus and take notes very well. However, they both cost over a thousand dollars. They are worth every penny though since OneNotes is pretty much the best note taking application on the market and has it's full features only for Windows computers. However, I wasn't willing to spend that much on a machine I would use primarily to take notes on so a Galaxy 10.1 is a great deal for me.I've also rooted the device and disabled all the junk apps Samsung preinstalled it with. This has made the tablet run much faster. I've made sure to disable all the \"KNOX\" apps too.Battery life is pretty much amazing. It will last a whole day no doubt. If you don't get the case for it, the tablet doesn't do a good job of gripping to the surface you place it on. Even with the fake leather material on that back it still can slide off a surface that is at an incline. Easy fix if you just buy a case that has better friction.I've heard that a Galaxy note 12.2 edition is coming out next year, so you might want to hold off buying this if you want an even bigger screen, one that actually is the size of a piece of paper. This would be great to take notes on. Like I said, scrolling for me is not a problem with the 10.1 though.Design wise this thing is pretty nice. Even though it's mostly plastic, this allows for the tablet to be lighter.The people who complain about that lag are sort of right. It doesn't lag much but a few rare times I will see some stuttering. For people who complain about exiting apps being too slow, go to S Voice, go into Settings, and uncheck the box \"Open via home key.\" Closing apps is slow because samsung is waiting for a double press on the homekey so that it can open S Voice. Once you disable that function exiting apps will be fast.I'll update in a few months to see how well this tablet does.Edit (after a few months)SNotes sucks, it lags and crashes. I've found a much better app, LectureNotes. Pretty much the same as SNOTES, but doesn't crash, and is supported heavily by the developer.The two touch buttons on the bottom of the screen is a real pain since you can accidentally touch them while writing. Solution? When using LectureNotes, rotate the tablet upside-down so that the you can't touch the buttons.Battery is still fantastic, a good pro for this device.Still using it heavily as a note taking device, has not failed. The pen has also still lasted me, no problems thus far.The 12.2 note did come out, go check it out on amazon and see if you should get it.Love this tablet to death, looks great.

I'm a college student and was looking for something to replace my aging laptop. I was originally looking for some sort of ultrabook or 2-in-1 laptop, but I finally thought that a tablet might suit my needs better, seeing as I already had a full desktop in my room.I wanted something that I could use for notetaking in class, writing reports, and general web stuff (Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, etc). Looking through all the options out there, I finally narrowed it down to getting an iPad Air, Surface 2, or this Note tablet. They all had their respective pros and cons, but I finally settled on the Note. It seemed perfect for what I needed it for. It has the S-Pen for taking notes, and since it was a Galaxy like my SIII phone, I was already very familiar with its features and app selection. It also comes installed with Polaris Office, which would allow me to work on office documents. Now I'll begin to touch on some various aspects of the device in detail, and say whether they are a strength or weakness of the device:Pros:-DISPLAY: The screen is 2560x1600, which is a 16:10 aspect ratio. It's brilliant and looks just as great as the Retina displays on the iPad. Not much more to say.-SOUND: There aren't many devices out there that have double speakers for stereo anymore, so this was great to see on the Note. Everything sounds clear and loud, from games, to music, to Netflix movies.-PERFORMANCE: This device has dual quad-core processors. One to run low-performance applications, and one to help run more demanding ones. It also has 3GB of RAM, which I don't think I've ever seen in any other mobile device. The Note seems to do just fine on every game I've thrown at it, even the highly-detailed 3D ones. The processors really help with the tablets multi-tasking as well. You can run two apps side-by-side on the screen, and even open up more with the Pen Window feature, and it handles it all pretty well.-ACCESSORIES: My favorite part of the Note is definitely the S-Pen. I've taken a lot of notes with it over the past couple of weeks, and it's just as easy to do as using traditional pen and paper. Except that I don't have to worry about sharpening a pencil or running out of ink of course! The S Note program that comes preinstalled on the device is wonderful. Every note you take can be exported and stored by Google Drive, or you can save them as PDFs. Or you can have the program turn every bit of handwriting into normal text, which it does remarkably well assuming your writing is somewhat legible. I should note that while the pen is great for taking notes, it doesn't beat out using a keyboard for writing longer documents like essays. For that you'll probably want a bluetooth keyboard, or an adapter to plug a USB keyboard into it.Cons:-UI: This is a rather minor weakness of the product. The default UI on the device is Samsung's TouchWiz. While it's nice to use if you're used to it on your Samsung phone or other device, it isn't known for being the most snappy of launchers. So straight out of the box, even after the initial firmware updates, there was still some of the dreaded \"S Lag\" present. The interface wasn't as quick or smooth as it should have been given the amount of power this device has. But never fear, for there is a very easy solution to this! And that solution is using a 3rd party launcher. I personally use Nova Launcher, and eventually bought the Prime version after using it for awhile. The S Lag virtually disappears, and the Note performs as smoothly as it always should have.-BATTERY: Okay, the battery life isn't really bad per se, but it is definitely worse than most iPad products I've seen. Even with fairly light use, you're going to want to charge it overnight if you plan on using it the next day. That isn't really a problem for me, as I always charge my devices at night anyways. What is more of a problem, however, is how slow the Note charges. Unlike the Note 3, the Note 10.1 does not have a USB 3.0 charging port. This really limits the rate that the battery is replenished. For example, one day I was using the tablet pretty heavily and by the evening it was down to around 10% charge. I wanted to watch a Netflix show before bed, so I connected it to its charger so I didn't have to worry about it dying on me in the middle of the show. But even with the charger connected, I guess the processor was working hard enough playing my HD video that the battery was *still* draining. Not really a huge issue I'd say, since I rarely have the charge get that low during an average day of use, but it was still surprising to me.Conclusion:Sorry if the review seems a little fanboyish and perhaps long-winded. But I seriously am loving this tablet so far. It fits my needs perfectly, and I'm so glad that I went with the Note over the competition. It is pretty pricey, but it's not really any worse than the high-end iOS or Windows tablets out there. I don't see how you could go wrong with it.P.S.

This year I decided to save my Christmas and birthday money to buy one. So I came to this.The tablet came 90% charged, which was really surprising to me. I never had any device come more than 50% charged. Upon using the device I noticed the screen turning on was slow. I believe Samsung made this as design, and I'm sure there is a way around it if you dig deeper into the system after you root it, but I rather not go that deep.Clicking the home button had a delay when exiting apps. This is because of the S-voice and the magazine feature. Disabling them made it a whole lot faster. But I ended up freezing those applications after I rooted the device, which made the tablet even faster in return.After rooting the device and freezing all the bloatware that it comes with the tablet became a lot smoother and faster. There was no more of that unsmooth pattern unlock which made you mess up, no more battery draining, no more random speed drops, etc... It just became the tablet it should be. I considered returning it before I rooted it because of the performance issue. But now it's not a problem. (Did you know Amazon bans for too many returns? I prefer to keep my returns low.)But of course when you root your device you will void your warranty, which is pretty stupid. They should allow rooting since their the ones that slow down the tablets by putting junk software on it that no one uses. Totally worth it though!One problem is if you have a Anker portable charger. The tablet will not charge on the 2A port, only the 1A port. Unsure why. My Android phone works fine on both ports. If you use the tablet on the 2A port then it will start randomly clicking on the screen somehow. Luckily it's not a phone as it tried to make an emergency call on an application!The screen itself is a fingerprint magnet. Prepare to clean it often. Very often.

I can't give it 5 because it is not perfect.  I spent 4 months doing research, reading, and watching tons of reviews. I had tried to find reviews that were not biased one way or the other towards Apple or Samsung.  The other tablet I was considering was an IPad Air. If you read a review from a magazine that gets big advertising dollars from either of these guys who are they going to choose? I am familiar with Apple as I own a MacBook Pro, an Ipod touch 5th generation, Apple Tv too, and used to use an IPhone.  I have several Android tablets and a Window 8 tablet too.Which tablet you buy really depends on what you want to use it for.  The IPad Air is a nice tablet.  It has a great display, it is fast, and thin.  Apple apps run very fluid.  Apple has an advantage here since they are the only company who makes their tablet they can more easily optimize the software to hardware. Also developers often design apps with ios in mind first but that is changing. I have noticed that a lot of my ios apps run smoother than the same ones on Android but that gap has really closed.  An IPad is easier to learn than Android.  If you are looking for something to watch videos, browse the Internet,  and check emails it is great. It comes preloaded with Iworks now so you can get a little work done too.Now for the note which is the one I ultimately bought.  I wanted something that I could take notes with and do simple photo edits with. There is more of a learning curve with using the note but it is worth it.  The pen is a great feature.  It is great for note taking, drawing, and comes in handy for photo edits too. I have the 32 gb version with a 64 gb micro sd card installed.  This is not an option with an IPad.  Samsung let's you store apps on the card too.  I loaded photos onto the tablet with a card reader,  did some minor edits, transferred the pics to the external sd card and then copied them to a usb flash drive. You can not do that with an iPad.  Wacom does make a Bluetooth pen for the iPad that works fairly well but not nearly as well as the one on the note. Plus it cost around $100.  A big complaint of the note is there is lag when going from one app to another. It has not been a big deal for me most of the lag is due to the Touchwiz interface that Samsung uses.  However you can make some adjustments like disabling animations or you use a different app launcher like Nova, Apex, or Action which are very straightforward and fast and most of your lag issues will go away. I didn't see that much lag on Touchwiz to be honest but Samsung is trying to do a lot of things with it and a lot of programs run in the background that take up ram. When I loaded another launcher the speed did improve.  I really love the things I am able to do with this thing. You have a lot more freedom using the note vs. an Ipad. Apple IOS is going to be more consistent because Apple is the only company that uses it.  Many companies use Android and they all add there own touches to it that is going make Android less consistent from device to device.It came down to features for the money.  I don't like the Apple gouge factor.  $100 for each increment of storage with no option to add any on your own. A 64 gb card is $37 on Amazon and when they fill up you can just get another one.  I pads will not recognize flash drives and will not let you transfer data to a flash drive or sd card. You can view photos with a card reader but that is all. $100 more for the Bluetooth Wacom pen when a better one is included on the note.  Apple charges a premium price for their tablet and doesn't even offer a camera with a flash.  Then there is the planned obsolescence. I experienced this with my Iphone after 2 years there were a lot of apps that would not run on it. On my MacBook I loaded programs on it and then upgraded to the next os and they no longer worked. I would get messages that power dvd programs were not longer supported. I had to look for updates or redownload programs through the app store. People using the first iPad can't use many of the current apps from the app store. My wife has an Asus transformer several years old that has no problems running most apps. It has been my experience that Apple designs products according to what they think is best for me. For example Apple thinks that I don't need flash so they pretty much ended support for it on many products. They decided I didn't need an optical drive anymore (my MacBook was the last one with a dvd drive included). Of course I can purchase additional storage in ICloud or buy an external drive. Samsung tries to listen to their customers and design products that give them every feature that they want. Maybe even too much so.  If there was a tablet made in the U.S. I would buy it.  At least Samsung does 90% of there work in South Korea rather than shipping 90% of their manufacturing to China and calling themselves an American company. I have a Dell Venue 11 Pro I didn't include it in this review because it is in a different price category and runs a full desktop operating system so I didn't want to compare it with the other two.

As I said, spent about two months with this galaxy note 2014 and haven't been disappointed,  but I do have some nit picking for folks looking to purchase should be aware off. First off, my chief annoyance is with the internal gyroscope.  If you have a flip detachable keyboarded case that have magnetic backplate and strips, there no way to use the drop down menu android users are accustom using as the gyroscope is extremely sensitive to anything magnetic and will lock the drop down menu until the tablet is removed from the case. There's no way to turn this off or disable it, plus I read overtime it can permanently damage the gyroscope so please take this into consideration when purchasing a flip case for this tablet. Next is this Samsung My Magazine app that built into the menu button, when navigating the home screen using the menu button WHICH SHOULD bring up the menu screen only to be redirected the My Magazine app, which I mind you cannot be turned off or disabled. My last annoyance is with a great number of app that can't or won't allow for landscape mode or run on the tablet seeing as they were built for smartphones and the tablet option was an add on. Its the same OS platform built android,  how in the heck an app works for one and not the other mind you this is a developer issue. Google controls the platform,  they need to encourage developers to cross build for the android both smartphone and tablet equally.  Now that this is out of the way,  let's get back to the reason I bought the galaxy note 2014. My computer motherboard was faulty and was in need of repair and if your like me everything is done on your computer. So I toiled through online reviews to find a tablet to replace my computer if only temporary with maybe similar accessible features to get through day to day use and top specs hence the galaxy note 2014 tab. It uses Firefox, Pulse news feed, Skype, YouTube, and a host of other apps I use on my tiny 4.2 inch Samsung nexus and places onto a 10.1 inch screen eliminating the constant eye strain and occasional tapping on in app ad's that have no barring to me whatsoever.  I use all these apps on my PC as well, so this was a win-win-win for me. The interface runs smooth with no hitches or hiccups, all apps open within one second upon tapping on them, and the setup is what you'd expect from an Android device. All the 10.1 screen real state does make a difference when using smartphone apps vs tablet apps. This tablet has handled everything I through at it with relative easy and after a day of moderate use I still have just over a half battery charge left to work with. If you're waiting on the new galaxy note or tab pro 12.1 or 8.7, the galaxy note 2014 has the exact same hardware specs pound for pound,  the only difference is the new tab pro run android 4.4 allowing 4 on screen open apps at once, while the galaxy note 2014 runs android 4.3 allow 2 open apps on screen at once if that a big deal too you. Kitkat 4.4 for the 2014 will be out sometime in April after the Samsung galaxy 5 phone is released,  so unless you really need kitkat 4.4 immediately, I'd say get the 2014 as all these 2014 Samsung tablets are the same. If you don't believe me,  checkout the other written and video reviews on the new Samsung tab pro 12.1. With that said, you can also root the 2014 to run a custom 4.4 unofficial kitkat rom with all the kitkat goodness.

The following points are for the replacement I got, which is great![FIRST! Before you set everything up the way you want it, I recommend you install the 2 firmware updates](As of 10-19-13)Pros-Amazing, bright screen-Fast!-Great multitasking capability-Application partition seams much larger so you can install TONS of apps(can move some to microSD if needed as well)-Battery life(I get a solid 9-12+ hours)[5-6 of heavy use with high screen brightness]-Battery charge time[5 hours from completely dead to %100](My Galaxy Tab 10.1 took about 6.5 hours and my Asus TF700T takes about 6)-Using the S-Pen is more responsive than previous Note products, and very accurate-Current Software[Android 4.3](This does mean, there may be kinks to work out)-Lightweight/small for a 10.1 inch screen[significantly smaller than my Galaxy Tab 10.1 and my TF700T] This makes it much easier to hold and use for extended periods of time-A non-proprietary charging/data port[MicroUSB](YAY!!! So nice to not carry multiple chargers)-Speakers sound better than ANY other tablet speakers I have heard, including all iPads, and they're loud[This is still not going to output sound good enough for casual music/videos](Being side-mounted helps hearing them when it's lying flat)-Cameras are good, not awesome, but works in a pinch, or for video calls[Equal to the camera quality of a Galaxy S 3]-The faux leather back feels nice and the tablet feels more solid than previous Samsung devices with no creeking/flexing or movement-Expandable memory through MicroSD card slotCons[mostly nit-picking]-Wish it had the Snapdragon 800 that the Note 3 has[Would solve the terrible gallery performance]-Wish it had the same updated Camera app as the Note 3-Some software still needs time to get better-High res screen sometimes means while surfing the web and in some apps, my finger is too big to make a selection so I have to use the S-pen even though I have average sized fingers-Lack of accessories[Samsung should have a few accessories made for this by the time they release it IMO]-Having the capacitive back/menu buttons is inconvenient when using the tablet in portrait mode-The Touchwiz gallery app is TERRIBLE, it draws thumbnails every time you open the app, so if you have lots of photos, it hangs/lags sotyhty bad that it can render the device unusable.[I use QuickPic and it handles everything fine](For people that dont have 4K+ photos you will still likely need to disable weather/buddy tagging, dropbox photo displaying, Google+ photo syncing/displaying, Facebook photo syncing/sharing and clear the app cache for the gallery to get decent performance from the stock gallery)-I wish the battery charging was faster[It may get a little better with time as I have only charged it a few times]-I wish it had the USB 3.0 port that the Note 3has, but file x-fers aren't too bad-I wish it had a full USB port, and perhaps, a microHDMI so I didn't have to use donglesOverallLike I have stated, this is the best tablet I have ever owned, among several.

I have an iPad 2 for work but wife has the iPad 3 so better comparison.I've owned the following tablets:Lenovo Android 1st GenSamsung Galaxy Tab 1st GenMotorola XoomNexus 7Apple iPad 2 and 3Amazon Kindle Fire 1st GenWe as a company changed over to Google Apps 4 years ago and I find it an excellent platform that surpasses anything Microsoft puts out in total.  Cross functional with Microsoft Apps as they have refined the software and works very well for business users, unless you need a heavy graphics type software.That being said, this tablet is by FAR the best tablet I've used, in the short period of time that I have been testing it.I take a lot of notes in business meetings, and I am also a heavy Evernote user/Google Drive user.This tablet integrates beautifully with Evernote.  The S Note feature alone makes this tablet a winner for those that prefer to write notes during meetings and not look like a fool banging away on an iPad screen which can really be distracting especially if you have one on one meetings with a client.The Pen itself is extremely comfortable to handle, it writes smoothly, and if you choose, converting to text is VERY accurate, and I really do have Chicken Scratch like handwriting.  That said, it's not flawless, but pretty damned close.The hardware is excellent, it's buttery smooth when moving from screen to screen, and app to app.  Not sure how others complain of lag, but then again, I've only had it for 7 days so maybe it bogs down over time.  Thus far, that's not been the case.It's very light...can easily hold in one hand although it's not designed or meant to be used that way.I used QuickOffice Pro HD, Polaris that it comes with, as well as Google Drive for all my word processing, PPT, and Excel needs.  All of these will work just fine for the average business user.The colors on the device are FAR superior to my iPads 2 and 3...I read somewhere that someone felt the colors were muted or not that bright but I suspect the user had the brightness turned WAY down because this just blows away my iPads.  My wife, a long time Apple Loyalist, agrees with me that this tablet is brighter and just looks better when looking at movies, internet videos, etc.We looked at pictures, the exact same pictures, on both the iPad and Galaxy Note 10.1 and no question that while the iPad does look great, this tablet is just better overall.  We looked at them over and over and while to the average user you might not care or notice, I did.Now, I too am invested in the Apple Ecosystem...We have an Apple TV and a lot of movies and music purchased that we access.I also have company issued iPad.  I use the Apple TV and airplay to do wireless presentations, and it works great.However, I always laugh when Apple tries to tout their App Store as so much far superior in content than Android.  Yeah, if you need a lot of fart apps, and apps that don't really mean a whole lot to the AVERAGE user, than sure.  But overall, all the major apps, companies that have apps, have one for both Apple and Android at this point.  So that's just a stupid useless comparison based solely on numbers.The experience of using this Note vs Apple is where there is the major difference.  The Note for me just feels better when using it.  I feel like I'm using a professional device for a true professional.  I can see where with students, this would be even better, with the variety of note taking capability that the S-Pen offers.S-Note, Action Memo, Scrap Booking features are just excellent for anyone that needs to take notes.  And the AutoDesk Sketchbook app is fantastic, although I will probably use it less than others because I'm not an artist.  My daughter used it and drew beautiful pictures and now she's constantly asking for me to use it.Another feature I like is the WatchON app that came with it.  I control by TV and Directv receiver with it, but the content it offers is excellent...tracking my favorite programs and easily recording or even watching them if the service is available is a snap.I watched for about 30 minutes Prometheus on this and it was flawless.Apple is a great product...no question, but really, at the end of the day, it's more an entertainment device than that for a serious professional.  I'm sure you can try, like I did with the keyboards and various apps to make it a professional device, and it can be customized if you'd like, especially if you're 100% invested in the Apple Ecosystem, but I didn't want to be married to one.I have the Galaxy Note 3 for my phone as well, so I have both Android for work, and Apple for play.If you are a professional who finds they need a tablet for note taking, multi tasking, or a student that needs notes for classes or artistry, this is the tablet for you.  If you want a tablet to just watch movies and videos, or listen strictly to music and play games on, I'd recommend the iPad.This 10.1 2014 edition is sleek, fast, multi functional, has the min SD card slot as well for that extra storage, can handle all the movies I through at it, and looks fantastic..feels great in the hand, much lighter than any Android tablet I've had in the past except maybe the Nexus 7...I'll be testing it over the next 3 weeks to make sure it still performs as it should..but for now, very little to complain about.PROS:LightFast ProcessorPen Ability far superior to othersResponsiveProfessional look and build qualityBuilt in Speakers are loud and clear..better than many tablets on marketColors are beautifulBoot time less than 30 seconds.CONS:ExpensiveWish Pen had an alert like Note 3 to let you know if you left it outPen feels almost too light (doesn't affect performance)Not a whole lot of accessories for it.EDIT... UPGRADE TO 5 STARS. WHY?Battery life is outstanding.  I'm getting well over a full day of really heavy use. That's constant email, note taking, browsing, Pandora and podcasts running in background. I don't do video games so cannot comment on that but for heavy business use I'm unplugging at 530am,reading WSJ and NY Times, watching video highlights on ESPN, checking emails for hours, typing emails, and taking notes during calls.  My screen is on more than half the time and by time I plug in at 11pm I'm still at 25% battery left.I also watched movie for 2 hours on flight and under same circumstances still had 15% left.Brightness is at about 50% and wifi constantly on.  Fantastic battery life.UPDATE :  BIG UPDATEWell, I'm frustrated now after having this for a couple months.What's happening?  For whatever reason, I need to reboot the tablet every single day.  I can feel it get VERY hot in back, and then, the clock stops working and it starts to lag.I did a full factory reset and that worked..for 2 days...and it started all over again.  And I did not have apps reinstalled on it.  So it's NOT an app issue.I don't know what is happening but this has become so frustrating now.Everything else I stand by, but how the hell can you give this a high rating when this continues to happen with no fix?", "Date": "November 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "AMAZINGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG FAST", "Author": "Carter \"O.C.\"", "ReviewID": "R25CJUYY2PUUI8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros: This tablet is really beautiful...

Let down by poor hardware (sd card reader is inoperable*) and suboptimal UI decisions.[*Update 2 February 2014 - in the past month or so the SD card reader seems to be reading the card that is in there properly.  However, I have not tried swapping it over]DiscussionI have a complex relationship w my note. When I first received it, its apparent heavy reliance or Wifi was a big turn off. I want the device primarily as a mobile sketchpad where I don't need to be tethered to the net. I would also like to get work stuff (reviewing and drafting documents) done on it. Overall I am happy with the tablet despite its failings. I do not propose to focus on its strengths other than to say overall I've rated it 4 stars and the more I use it the more I like it.  Rather, let me list some of the issues I have faced with the tablet in my first week of use.If there is lag, I haven't noticed it.  In sketch if you sweep the s pen around the screen (with a small nib)  the pen will be 1-2cm behind the pen tip. As you slow down it catches up.  When sweeping slowly the follow distance is 2-3mm.  The only lag which I think might be of practical importance is the page turn lag in the S pen, but I haven't had a chance to take notes in meetings with it yet.Issues with note 10.1Many application features are difficult to discover.  Always press the menu button, just in case!It is good to be able to take hard written notes w/out them being converted into text (conversion takes too long, particularly if correcting mistakes).  The handwriting recognition is not good enough - at least fed my writing (this was handwritten, but subsequently heavily edited, \"fed\" is just there for a feel of the errors (for)).  The virtual keyboard is bad for characters like ' \" () because each time you want one of these characters it requires 3 key presses (symbol keyboard, symbol, alpha keyboard buttons).  This is a very serious problem for me. These are commonly used glyphs. It makes me wonder whether this software is used by actual people before being released. Also of concern is the lack of arrow keys or the virtual keyboard. I assume the designers decided you could just tap the screen with your s pen.  This is an exercise in frustration.  Hunting the screen for the right tap spot is much harder than hitting the arrow keys a couple of times. Autocorrect generally works well - but sometimes quite poorly. No easy way to correct a bad autocorrect.  The hardware buttons are not good. I hit them too often, esp using the device flat on a table. Turning the device upside down doesn't quite solve the issue because you obscure the light sensor and the screen goes dim.  Using handwriting is slow compared to typing on the virtual keyboard.  That, in turn, is slow compared to typing on a proper keyboard. On the upside there's something therapeutic about writing your notes.  I have turned off the button on the S Pen because I kept pressing it accidentally when writing.The S Note application uses a weird page size - apparently you're supposed to keep adding these tiny pages (note taking size is roughly equivalent to card file cards).  When you turn the tablet from landscape to portrait mode, you just get the small card across the width, rather than a full portrait screen to do your note taking on.  [Edit: use a portrait template when creating a new note - thanks Eddard - an example of press the menu button I mention above] Export to text is not available(!) (it exports image files or pdfs, you can also share the text by email) - you can get the text by selecting it and copying it to the clipboard though.  Turning a page takes a tediously long time (although still only a second or two).  Annoying because it is presumably deliberately included for effect.Polaris office was woeful the last time I tried it. It looks like the new version has improved dramatically.  I haven't used it extensively though.It is hard to get a soft touch with s pen.  I would like to be able to configure the pressure curve for the s pen but this seems to be impossible.  Light pressure seems better in Clover paint than in  Galaxy sketch.The device doesn't come with an epub reader installed (?!)I have bad SD card issues*[see note above] - apparently a known issue w/ Samsung tablets - google \"SD card unexpectedly removed\". I have tried it with 2 SD cards now. It corrupted the first one. The second one is new and it will not read the card or even recognise that a card has been inserted. Yes, I have tried reformatting it - to within an inch of its life. It makes no difference.  The SD card reader is inoperable. The sd card is readable if connected via a card reader and a usb otg cable.My usb ethernet dongle does not work when connected by a usb otg cable.  Despite having wired internet available it insists on wireless.The Knox system looks interesting. I may use it but it is more designed to allow you corporate IT staff to quarantine data. Eg. I'd actually like to be able to move files from the Knox container to the public one, but I can't. Rather I have to email the file to myself, using up my data allowance.  What I really want is a per-file or per-directory encryption system.  If the SD card reader worked I could apparently use that as an encrypted container <sigh>.  There are only a handful of apps available for use in the Knox container.ConclusionDespite the very annoying failure of the sd card reader* my general impression of the device is very favorable.  I am a little concerned that it will either tie me to online services or lock my data in weird formats.  That said I am reasonably confident that I will be able to keep my data free.", "Date": "November 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just like the Galaxy Note Phone... only BETTER!", "Author": "Tara \"peacefulseraph\"", "ReviewID": "R23RMZS2E9RZ0X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I finally got my Galaxy Note tablet home and, wow- the product is amazing!

And once you link your Google account, it automatically downloads all compatible apps to your device for you. You'll still need to download Amazon apps individually- but you'll need to allow downloads from \"unknown sources\" to get them. Some anti virus programs (like Mcafee, Webroot, and Kaspersky) will make a big fuss over this- but if you want, there's a new feature that allows you to make a \"one time download\" without changing security settings permanently.With programs like Sketchbook Pro out there, I can't imagine that anyone could get bored with their s-pens.

I can't even think about the same on Kindle as the interface seems slow and unresponsive, it's improved quite a bit with Kindle HDX but there is still ways to go.For watching movies I prefer Kindle HDX 8.9 as it's the lightest of the three and has the best resolution and streaming is pretty seamless. The sound is perhaps the best of all devices but if you're using headphones it doesn't matter. Galaxy Note and iPad make the Chromecast streaming pretty seamless unlike the Kindle HDX, so if you're using your tablet to watch a movie on another screen keep that in mind.When you're holding the tablet the weight really makes a difference and for this reason I like to read books on my Kindle HDX 8.9. Although, nothing beats the Kindle Paperwhite for reading novels.Another thing about Galaxy Tab is that it's convenient to have a pen right on the tablet. The pen offers many point and click functions, but I just wish they were a little more user friendly and unobstrusive, so far I prefer to use my finger unless I am using a specific app that requires the pen. I was excited about the feature that turns handwriting to typed text but in reality it has a learning curve and is still not very intuitive. Right now I don't see an advantage over iPad if you're using a good stylus.If you're considering how to decide between iPad and Galaxy, the first thing you have to consider is the eco-system. If you've been using an Android phone the transition to Galaxy Note is seamless. But if you're an iPhone owner you may find the Android interface not as user friendly as it's not as simple and intuitive but offers more flexibility. If you have many apps that you love and use on iOS for example the Garage Band or iMovie then you may want to buy the iPad - these apps are now free with iPad Air.The other thing to consider is storage and importing files. The Galaxy Note allows you to put in a mini SD card to expand storage. That makes also it very convenient to access files on the Galaxy. However, with Dropbox and direct streaming from many sites the need for expanded storage is diminished. There are also now many products out there that function that don't need WiFi to create a network expand storage on the iPad.The Kindle HDX has a closed eco-system that does not allow any outside apps like Nook, iBooks in books or music from iTunes. I am especially frustrated by not being able to read my magazines in one place as there are separate apps required for each magazine. iPad's newstand integrates all magazine apps for one seamless experience. Kindle HDX is most useful if you have more content from Amazon. But it's cheaper and has a pretty decent email interface and a free Office app so it can be used as a multi-purpose device. It also has a send to Kindle feature that allows you to \"print\" any doc to your Kindle. I love that feature.Overall, the Galaxy Note is a very useful device with the most features of all three and is the most flexible. However, I use it the least. My main tablet usage is surfing the internet, reading magazines/newspapers, watching movies/TV, editing photos and the iPad is still my go-to device due to it's shape, speed, and app eco-system. Kindle HDX is next for it's video-viewing and all the content I have from Amazon. Samsung Galaxy Note though versatile is not my go-to device for any one thing - so it loses out. However, it comes the closest to a PC replacement if I did more office work on my tablet so I still like having it around especially when I travel.The Galaxy Note came with a ton of freebies like Google Play and Samsung Store credit, expanded Dropbox for 2 years, Boingo membership for one year, Businessweek subscription for a year, Hulu Plus membership for 3 months which was very nice. No other device offered all these freebies so if they're still being offered when you buy the tablet, factor that into the cost.", "Date": "February 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "another winner", "Author": "Mary F. Hazlett \"mhazlett\"", "ReviewID": "RNWTISJADT3FG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned every Samsung Note tablet/phone except the first Note phone.  So you can say i love the Note serries.  I have also owned nearly every Samsung tablet, many  Kindles, Nooks, and have the Ipad 2 and had the ipad mini (first mini).  So, i'm well rounded.  To think i went into technology kicking and screaming in the early 2000's!This tablet is awesome.  I've definitely note explored all of the features yet on it because at the present time i also own the Note 8 and my phone is the Note 3.  I've also for the first time learned how to sync my SNotes with Evernote; that may sound basic, but i didn't know how to do it and now someone at Best Buy spent time with me helping me learn.I own the Note series because I like Android -- for those who say that there are many more choices in the apple app stores i say how many apps does one really need?  Everything i look for is available in the Play store.The multi window function is great, although i don't make use of it as  often as those who work might.  I retired a few years ago. I buy the series because of the S pen.  I keep a journal, and enjoy handwriting it.  I love keeping one on papeer, but when i am traveling without my large backpack/messenger bag, i can handwrite on this.  I also use the SNote function to keep a grocery list on my phone.  I save all kinds of things in Scrapbook, such as tips from a great source called Dripler (in the Google Play store).  I also like the fact that when i do my banking, i can, using the Spen, bring up a calculator on the check page to do my checkbook balancing.This baby comes with a lot of perks.  Off the bat i received a credit for $25 in the Play store, $50 in the Samsung Hub store, free magazines from Zinio (i don't get the crredit because i already have the app -- by the way, many public libraries have Zinio -- magazines -- available for checkout and unlike books, when a magazine is checked out, you keep the magazine), a 3-month Audible trial for audio books in Amazon (again, because i already have an account, i am not eligible), and 50G of free dropbox storage.  And, a free 3month trial of the NYTimes. Samsung says these freebies are worth $600.I'm not wild about the price, but if i held off for a while, the price would come down.  I thought and thought about whether to get this new 10.1 2014 Note since i currently have and use the Note 8, as well as my phone.  I also use my ipad, but because it is in a leather keyboard folio, it is heavy to cart around if i just want to lighten my load.  Yes, i can remove it from the folio.  But an advantage of android is the Swype feature -- being able to slide my fingers from letter to letter on the keyboard.  It is easier than the hunt and peck typing method on the on-screen keyboard of the ipad.  I do have several portable keyboards, but the one i'm currently using when i want a keyboard is an excellent one by Brookstone.  I have the one with the little shelf which can hold a device on it.  But because the keyboard can be removed, i can simply slide this slim full-size keyboard in my bag if i want to.  The whole thing is lighter than my keyboard folio for the ipad.  Many small bluetooth keyboards are weird -- when i type on them foreign symbols pop up and i have to select what i want, slowing down the typing.  I'm a good typist, and the brrokstone is simply a regular but lighthweighth keyboard.I highly recommend this tablet. It is fun, good for professionals, comes with great features and lots of 3-month expensive freebies, and it has -- oh yeah -- an expandable memory, unlike the fruit tablets. That is also a big selling point.  I have all of my music on a micro card and can simply put the card into the Note series.You can't go wrong.

If 1/2 stars were possible, then I'd give it 4.5 because of the high price tag. I work in academia and run my own research lab. I have to attend various meetings and many other functions that require a lot of thoughts to be thrown around, saved, and eventually have to follow-up on them. I've owned a Galaxy Tab 10.1 (first generation), Google Nexus 10, and Apple iPad 3, trying to be patient with the Note series until it matured and wasn't yet sold on the idea of the S-Pen let alone a generic stylus. Well, it has matured and has the muscle behind it. The S-Pen feature is what separates this tablet apart from the aforementioned tablets, as they all were simply media consumption devices and had no further usefulness beyond checking email and watching videos. I'm not a game player, so I really don't care for this aspect. The built-in Samsung apps are very basic and don't offer a great experience. Thus, I felt compelled to look beyond the Sammie ecosystem. Thus, I downloaded a free Android app called, \"Papyrus,\" paid for a few premium features costing around $3 each, and I have never looked back. Note-taking with this app complements the capabilities of the S-Pen very well. The pen is sensitive and responsive enough to feel like natural hand writing -- granted, it is not absolutely perfect, but for what it's worth, it is great. The Papyrus app does what it's supposed to without being too gimmicky and cute like other writing apps.Pros:1. Quickly, easily, and accurately write down important notes and save or convey/share those thoughts to others.2. Mirror my tablet on an HD television screen in a meeting room and write everything so people can collaborate / review in real time.3. Export or share notes in various formats (PDF, PNG, JPG) via email, SMS, and the usual set of sharing mediums.4. With #3 above, I find it very useful to MMS my notes, as it reduces the need for typing a full-blown message. Anyone with a tablet knows that typing stinks, no matter what brand you have. Steve Jobs was completely wrong about the utility of the stylus!5. S-Pen is very accurate and responsive. You can also lay your palm on the screen while writing and there's no \"background\" pickup. It can be accessed easily and stored discretely.6. Tablet has the hardware specs capable of handling what I need to do -- use productivity apps, watch videos/movies on the plane, and a whole lot more!7. Did I mention that the screen resolution is awesome? Well, it's awesome!Cons:PriceBuilt-in Samsung S-Pen apps still weak -- find yourself some other Android appsIf you are serious about being productive at work while also being able to enjoy \"intense\" multimedia, then this device will not let you down.

The response of the screen with her fingers or pen are spot on and lets her do exactly what it is she wants to do.

If/when I get the apps straightened out and IF that improves, I will come back and update my review to five stars.This is a lightning fast tablet.  Graphics are exceptional.  Keyboard, swipe and voice commands outstanding.I had narrowed it down to either Samsung Galaxy Note 2014 or the new iPad Air.  The Note 2014 won out for me for several reasons.  1) it has SD card capability built in rather than having to buy a usb peripheral  2) cost is pretty much the same  3)  since my pcs are currently Windows and my smart phone Android,  I didnt want to have to deal with yetanother operating system and/or set of apps.12/05/2013 - brief update - I have been using this for a month now and I absolutely love it!!  I was able to straighten out the apps and have had no further issues.  I will say though that some of the apps could use some tweaking so they can take full advantage of this tablets capabilities.  I have updated to a five star review for this new \"toy\" :-)", "Date": "November 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "BLUETOOTH CONNECTION ISSUE WITH ANDROID 4.3", "Author": "Laptop charger comment", "ReviewID": "R32Y68JBXMAVMQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have been using the tablet for a while and it is one of the best tablet out there for student. I'm in my last  semester in college and this one has been doing a fantastic job for taking note in class.The tablet however has some flaw associated with it. The Samsung bloatware does slow the tablet down at times and it can be improved by disabling Samsung native apps.However, one big concern is that the Android 4.3 version came pre-installed on the tablet is showing some sort of problem with the Bluetooth connection. XDA Android forum and other Android forums have pointed out that the Bluetooth constantly and briefly disconnect from time to time if WIFI is on, especially with Bluetooth keyboard and mouse. This issue can be fixed by simply download one of the two apps from Google Play Store: Bluetooth Keep Alive or Bluetooth Keep Active. This seems to have fixed the issue. However, you may expect the bluetooth to drop 2 - 3 times at the beginning. After that, the bluetooth drop occurs less frequently about once every fiffteen minutes (I don't know why, it just does). It is expected that Android 4.4 will resolve this issue (At least I hope so)I'm typing this review on a MiniSuit leather case keyboard and the connection drops once every 10 minutes or so. LOLI talked to Samsung rep on the phone and they suggested a series of possible reasons/solution for this issue:1. \"Your keyboard may not be compatible with Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014\". If this is the case then MiniSuit is lying about their leather case product that are being sold on Amazon. I highly doubt this.2. \"You may need to use Samsung Generic Bluetooth keyboard\". I asked the rep to tell me which Samsung keyboard is compatible with this tablet. He said hold on a minute and then apologize that the note 10.1 2014 does not have compatible bluetooth keyboard. Well, at least he was being honest as I double checked on Samsung site and there wasn't any that are suggested for 2014 edition.3. \"You may need to reset the tablet\". Fortunately, I was able to factory reset the tablet and tried if it fixed my issue. This still doesn't fix my problem.4. \"We will take note of this issue, please wait for the next OTA update to roll out and hopefully it will fix your issue\". Well, I can see where this is going.Overall, the tablet is a solid 3/5. I took off 1 star for the fact that the tablet is loaded with Samsung Bloatware and it does slow down the tablet at times. Even the Magazine application (Samsung integrated) suffers. I took off another star because of the bluetooth issue. This device is hitting hard on student as we want to use it as a desktop replacement. The inability of having a sturdy bluetooth connection really set Samsung one inch behind other tablets comparable to it.I have an iPad Air and it does not have the same issue. Hopefully Samsung will step up in their game in the near future.", "Date": "December 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "After Upgrades and Factory Reset, the Tablet is Not as Bad as it Seems", "Author": "Lago \"Lagoboss\"", "ReviewID": "R2TK6W44XBJ7NI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "[Edit 10/27/2013]After I began to edit the review, I thought it would be best to reopen the packed box and retest the tablet.  To my shock, it was amazingly fast compared to last Friday 10/25/2013.  Why?  I think that the two software updates that the tablet received needed a factory reset to actually take advantage of the updates.After the factory reset, the tablet is much more stable and is quicker than the 2012/2013 model.  Moving forward, I will retract my first review and expand it.  I want to thank those that participated in the discussion; their feedback and suggestions helped me to give this tablet another try.This review will be broken up to various sections.  They include: applicability of technical specs, applicability of software features, Samsung perks, UI, physical attributes, and the upgrading process.Applicability of Technical Specs:2560X1600 Screen:This screen is very bright, brilliant, and sharp.  It's actually one of the best screens I have ever seen on a tablet.  It actually blows the N8000s screen away.  Its very easy on the eyes while browsing the internet, reading a book or watching a movie.4 core 1.9 GHz Processing Power with 3gb of ram:The tablet can handle close to any application that is thrown at it.  After the updates and factory reset, S Note imported the entire 56 page pdf while the N8013 was still importing slide 17 of 56.  While playing graphically intense games, the tablet is smooth as butter.  When switching between apps and screens, the tablet does so rapidly with no lag.8220 mAh Battery:The original N8013 had around a 7000 mAh Battery and use to last all day.  However the increased processing speed and screen capabilities may draw excess power from the 2014 note's 8220 mAh battery.  So far, the Note 2014 has decent battery life.  The screen has been on for 7 hours and 43 minutes.  While the screen was on, I was taking notes with Lecture Notes for about 4-5 hours.  I spent about 30 minutes using Handy Scanner, an app that takes photos of documents and imports them into pdf files.  Also, I sent a lot of emails and uploaded a lot of files to to my Google Drive.  the brightness level of the screen was about 20% which is really bright in a lit room.  The battery is at 14%.  I got up at 6:00 am and started using it.  It is now 9:26pmRear 8 MP Camera:The camera is an upgrade over the 5MP camera on the N8013, however because the screen has a really good resolution, it seems to make the picture seem worse than it is.  I have this effect on my desktop computer with two monitors, bad pictures look better on the screen with the poorer resolution.  Anyhow, objectively, the camera is just like the ones from last year's cell phones.  The added flash is nice to have because a lot of tablets seem to leave this essential feature out.Capacity:Either you have the 16 GB or the 32 GB version; I'm pretty sure you know the benefits of both.  However its important to note that the 32 GB version leaves around 25 GB of actual space to use.  With the N8013, I never filled up the flash drive despite having close to 1000 songs, 200+ photos, and a years worth of lecture notes and document files.  However, usage patterns do vary; if you are the type of person that likes large games, then you could certainly get the 32 GB model of the device and then store extra content on a 64GB micro SD card.Applicability of Software Features:S Note:The main critical point of the 1st edition of this review revolved around S Note and the lag; S Note and the slow performance are the main reasons that I bought the tablet; the initial experiences ruined this tablet for me.  However, THE FACTORY RESET CLEARED UP ALL OF THE LAG/INSTABILITY IN S NOTE AND SYSTEM WIDE.S Note has a new interface that really contrasts with previous versions of S Note.  Shape and Formula Match have been separated from the main tool bar and included under the heading transform, the icon that resembles the cloud.On first thought, this seems innovative, however compared to the old version of Shape Match, this process can be counter productive.  For instance, on the old version, one could just select the shape match tool and then draw the shape.  If unhappy with the shape, the user could simply press the undo arrow and try again.  However, on the new version, you must write the text first and then transform it into a shape or text via the selection tool.  If you make a mistake, you must press undo and fix the thing that you were trying to transform.  This feature is annoying and counter productive in my opinion.  I frequently take Cornell notes where you draw a line down the middle of the paper, closer to the left side of the sheet.  With the new set up, I have two extra steps, I have to draw a line and then draw a free form or rectangular box around the imperfect line that I drew just to turn it into a straight line...As far as having Wolfram Alpha solve equations directly through S Note, some users have reported that its imbedded in the keyboard some where.Concerning old .snb files, the tablet does not support them on the fly, but it CAN convert them to the new format.  After the factory reset, the tablet is quicker and more stable at converting the .snb files; there have been no crashes during conversion.First glance, the previews to notebooks are gone on the new version of S Note.  The previews to the notes have been replaced with realistic looking book covers.  If you once depended on looking at the note in order to easily find it, think again; to get a preview, you must drag the icon down towards the bottom of the screen.There are more advanced templates available on the device; they actually look pretty nice.  Instead of calling home made templates \"templates,\" the device has a feature to import a photo to be used as a background for notes; this is better than nothing.As far as sync accounts within S Note, Google Drive seems to be missing as an option.  If there is a way to add it, please someone respond so that I can edit this.  In the mean time, I will look for a solution.  Currently on the 2014 model, Sync options include the Samsung Account and Evernote.Writing with the new S pen seems smoother and better, however that's due to the increased friction.  The increased friction seems to slow down writing a little, but an after market pen or more use may rectify this problem.[Edit: S Note Conversion/Import/Export File Sizes and Time to CompleteIF the relationship between file size and import/export/conversion time is linear, these results should be able to be generalized to your hypothetical 50,000KB files.My test file was a 16,314 KB pdf. To import the file, it took 197 seconds; this substantially quicker than the N8013. For your hypothetical file of 50,000 KB, the import would take around 10 minutes or 603.78 seconds IF the relationship is linear.This same 16,314KB pdf translated into a 59.74MB .spd S Note file once it was imported without any annotations. It took 40 seconds to export this file to a pdf document. For your hypothetical file of 50,000 KB, the pdf export should be around 122 seconds or 2 minutes.As far as converting .snb files to the new .spd format, the relationship seems to be 2 and a half minutes/80,000KB .snb file.]Multiview:Multiview is still here on the 2014 note.  Its useful but it doesn't use the same intuitive methods as the N8013 does.  Simply tapping on the icon for Multiview does not launch it along side another window, you must drag it over.I as well as other users initially reported that there is no pin window feature.  Upon further exploration, this is not true.  It is accessible from the Air View window; you must draw a space for the application and then select from the limited supply of apps including; calculator, alarm, You Tube, contacts, ChatOn, Hangouts, and internet.  In my opinion, this is counter productive in comparison to the old simple pin window button.Browser:The default browser has trouble with saving .ppt and .doc formats.  I went to blackboard and tried to download a .ppt for viewing and Polaris 5 wouldn't open it.  Using the Blackboard app rectified this occurrence.  I have not tested with Chrome yet.Polaris Office:Polaris Offcice is a great alternative to Microsoft Office for editing or creating documents on the fly.  I mainly use Polaris for converting powerpoints to pdf so that they can be imported to S note.  Polaris 5 can also be used for direct pdf and powerpoint annotations; this method does not seem to support palm rejection, but it's still very useful for those that follow slides, type notes on slides and do light annotations to the slides.Watch On:This is a great TV guide like application.  The bonus is that it uses the built in IR blaster.  This is a cool feature if you are missing the remote or want to impress friends.My Magazine:This is a great media hub for news.  If you follow world news, you can have a great deal of information in this one app.Sketchbook For Galaxy/ Photoshop Touch:Sketchbook For Galaxy is a great alternative to the missing Photoshop touch.  The sketchbook app provides an experience even closer to the real Photoshop desktop app.Samsung Perks:[Retrieved 10/27/2013 12:50 Central Time]\"Get a $50 credit for music, movies and TV shows through Samsung Hub and a $25 credit for games and apps through the Google Play(tm) Store. New Hulu Plus users get a 3-month trial and new Boingo users get mobile Wi-Fi access for 12 months. Also, new Audible users get 3 free audiobooks and new Zinio members get a 2-month subscription to 3 digital magazines. New BusinessWeek+ Tablet App users can also enjoy a 1-year free subscription, and new NYTimes.com + Tablet App users get a 12-week free subscription. All that, plus up to 50GB of Dropbox space--yours for 2 years from the time you set up the app.\"These perks speak for themselves :]User Interface:The tablet's user interface seems counterproductive in comparison to the more simple nature of the first edition.  There are some things that touchwiz does better and some things that it does worse.  All I can say is that the settings section is very confusing.  For example, Samsung even hid the developer options; they can only be unhidden by tapping the build # a number of times...Coming from the N8013's simplistic nature can be kind of harsh, but it is certainly doable.  Read the user guide or google the answers to your confusion.Physical Attributes:The tablet aesthetically is really nice on the eyes.  I always thought that the original N8013 was a little homely.  I'm not sure why the \"pleather\" (plastic leather) look has people complaining.  I think it looks nice.I do not like the capacitive buttons nor the home button on the bezel.  It becomes cumbersome to hold  the tablet in portrait mode; sometimes your hand may hit one of the capacitive buttons or it may be awkward to intentionally use them while the device is in portrait mode.  I have always found the softkeys that rotate with the screen better.  In addition, I don't like the feel of the home button, it seems like it may degrade over time; in my opinion, the less physical buttons, the better.  The iPhone, iPad, and iPod  home buttons of earlier generations seem more sturdy than button on the 2014 note; this may not be true, it's just a subjective thought.The S Pen tip certainly feels better on the screen compared to last year's model.  In addition, the S Pen seems even more comfortable to write with despite its skinny nature.  Another bonus is that it doesn't require a special rotation to get the S Pen into the stylus holder slot.Concerning weight and thinness, the tablet does look cooler than the previous edition, but if you are highly protective of the device and put it in a case, all of that really doesn't matter.The shift from Samsung's special usb cable is really nice.  Now, the tablet can interact with the USB cables that our smart phones have been using for years!Upgrade Experience:There are a lot of things that the tablet does that are similar to the N8000s, however there are a lot of things that are different.  There will be a learning curve and importing your old notes to the new note is not as straightforward as it could be.  However, the improved processing speed and screen are very compelling reasons to get this tablet.As of now, I officially recommend this tablet to new users or people that upgrade from a previous generation note.Again, I must reiterate  that after the factory reset, the tablet is much more stable and is quicker than the 2012/2013 model.  Moving forward, I want to thank those that participated in the discussion because their feedback and suggestions helped me to give this tablet another try.BEFORE BASHING THE TABLET AND INITIATING A RETURN PROCESS, TRY A FACTORY RESET AFTER THE UPDATES; I learned my lesson lol", "Date": "October 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Better productivity than its \"I\" brand competitor.", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"wolverine331\"", "ReviewID": "R3P1DOB0TH1WUJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this one used from Amazon....awesome no issues at all.

The tablet's backlight went out after it suffered a short drop from a counter onto the floor. (Surprising, as it had a case, was inside my bag, and landed on a carpeted floor.) Anyway, my experience was this: contacted Samsung, opened a repair ticket. After a couple days of no response, tried to send an email provided with my ticket. It bounced back. Tried to locate a Samsung service center, none near me (and I'm in LA). Forget calling. Looked up the nearest smart phone/tablet repair place. Took it to UbreakiFix. The guy behind the counter looked at it, took it in back, came back out, went on the computer, told me \"we can't get replacement parts for this, not even on eBay\". Forget that place. Being somewhat savvy with technology, I ordered a smart phone repair toolkit from Amazon. Found no guides online for how to open this thing, so I mustered up the courage to dive right in. I slowly pried off the back pseudo-leather plastic cover with the plastic wedge tool (never use metal tools, or you'll ruin the outside). There are clips all around the outer edge that unsnap if you pry the cover up high enough. There is also glue between the snaps, so be warned. The whole plastic back comes off in one piece, along with the cover for the rear camera/flash. From here, if you view any \"teardown\" videos for the original Note 10.1, it's quite similar. I opened and disconnected the two main connections that cross the battery (the biggest component inside). I then reseated them in their housing and closed the clips. Viola! My backlight works again, confirming my suspicions that the drop caused a connection inside to loosen. I snapped the back cover on again, no glue, so it's not quite as tight as before, but with the case back on, you can't tell. I hope this helps anyone looking to disassemble their tablet!

I had own a Toshiba Thrive tablet prior to this and that was great but of course new technology is available and so much is out there!

I choose them (wasn\u2019t hard because I already own a Samsung Camera EK-GC-110 Android camera of theirs-awesome!) because of all the features it has.  It has a Quad processor and 3 GB Ram memory, better camera megapixels; it is fast, and easy to use.  But I basically can do anything my laptop came do with the Wi-Fi hookup and it is much lighter than my Toshiba tablet indeed.

Samsung definitely got me hook on their products.As I did a review on their Android camera I am sure the same information applies to the tablet, make sure you use at least a Class 10 micro SD card and a branded name to avoid any issues with the card of the tablet not taking pictures or video.I had excellent customer service with Samsung on my Android camera so I am sure this will apply to the tablet whenever I should need them in the future.  Hopefully I don\u2019t but just in case they are there for you.Again I love the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1  2014 Edition because it has everything I possibly could want on a tablet, close to a laptop without having to lug a 17 inch laptop around with me.Pros:Awesome tablet, latest Android version, Quad processor and 3 GB Ram memoryAble to expand another 64 GB for external memory (microSD card, recommend Class 10 and branded name)Excellent camera megapixelsQuick response and multi-tasking windows to display just like a laptop!Excellent customer service!!!There are many more features too long to write about, I will say this tablet is outstanding.Cons:None", "Date": "January 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Product and Great Price !", "Author": "John D.", "ReviewID": "R259FTYHAL90U8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Another Great Samsung product,  its a 2014  I got it for what others are selling last years  Samsung,  Amazon is hard to beat.......", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Exactly What I Need", "Author": "L.

I love to draw with the s pen, it is more precise, some drawing apps ( Sketchbook for Galaxy note, pre installed) are designed with special versions to use with the S pen. It does not support flash (the most recent version) but I understand it can be downloaded from the flash archives (older versions). I will do that soon.  Over all once I upgraded to more memory I was very happy with the Tablet. It lags at times, certain apps, but I can live with it. I am sure future updates will fix that. with my iPad 2 and my Asus transformer, I often wished I old have apps opened side by side, now with this I can and do. The battery seems to run down a bit faster but with the power saver and a little experience I have learned what to turn off and on to save battery life. Most devices use battery power like mad. It is a little pricey and that made the decision to purchase this a little harder, same with iPad 2, but I have no regrets at all.

I only used it for a few days before deciding to return it. There's a lot of stupid problems here, not all of which are Samsung's fault. But overall, it's a no-deal for me.1) The Simpsons game \"Tapped Out\" ran so slow as to be unusable. The constant stuttering of the screen updates and the slowed-down animation made it obvious that somehow this particular game challenged the quad-core processor in the Note. It's a serious defect, considering a two year old model like the ASUS TF300 could run the game 10 times faster, and THAT unit is sluggish. This might be a specific issue with this game, and could be a software fix from EA. But it's important to consider, as the game it's very popular and widely used.2) The offers are  good deals, but they are limited to the device itself. For example, the free year of GoGo Inflight Internet? That's not something you can add to your existing account or even create a new account for. Instead, everytime you want to use it you must connect to GoGo from this tablet, click on a \"Chat Now\" button and request from a CSR a one-time code for that flight. You'll need to repeat that process everytime you want to use it, and it can't be used on a laptop or other device. Similar limitations exist for many, but not all of the offers. The 3 free audio books? Only 1 per month. All of these offers are really just trial subscriptions with a few exceptions. I *strongly* recommend checking out the details and fine-print here before buying: [...]3) This Note uses Android 4.4 aka \"KitKat\". There is a major change in Android 4.4 that affects how MicroSD card access works. Apps will no longer be able to access the entire card and read or write anywhere they want. Instead, each app will have its own little closed-off area to use, nothing else. This means general-purpose file explorer apps will not be able to see anything on a MicroSD card. Photo viewers will be similarly limited. Backup programs will not be able to backup files from a MicroSD card (though they will be able to backup file TO the MicroSD card). Most significantly, you will NOT be able to move apps to the MiroSD to free-up space in the internal memory. This is all being done by Google, not Samsung, but it still impacts this model.

It stopped working right 3 days after receipt.  I purchased the 3 year warranty, but my experience with these warranties was negative because Best Buy refused to even look at my last tablet the ASUS Transformer 700 when I took it to the store under the same type of warranty.  Best Buy Geek Squad Manager said it was an unidentified software problem,  thus not covered under the warranty.  They even wanted over $60 to set the tablet back to factory original. This requires 2 keystrokes.  One year later and at least 6 hard resets later they finally replaced the ASUS under warranty.  Skip ahead to March 2014. We bought the new Samsung and it stopped working after 3 days.  We spent 2 hours on the phone with Samsung.  Technical support top level tech stated it was a hardware error.  Finally after 2 hours and at some level of management,  we were told by Samsung that we could send the 3 day old device in for repairs,  it would take a month and we would end up with a device that wasn't new and had been cracked open. This was unacceptable. The manager finally transferred us to a very nice woman at Amazon.  It took less than 10 minutes and she had sent a new Samsung device along with return instructions sent to my email. I had the new device in hand on Monday and it's working and the broken one was picked up all by a very pleasant woman from Amazon.

It  caught my interest because of the capabilities of the spen. I had read online that the previous incarnation of the Note had clunky software, and didn't always work as advertised. The 2014 model, however, seems to have solved any issues that the older model may have had.As an artist the real-time stylus capabilities really caught my eye. I was also impressed that the stylus was built by the wacom company - I may be wrong, but I think this is the only tablet outside of the wacom family of products to use this technology. I have been wanting a tablet wih the capability to draw in real-time, and this tablet does not disappoint. It may not have the capabilities of a high-end Wacom drawing tablet, but for the price point it is great for sketching on the go. The stylus, while fairly basic, has the precision and usefulness you expect out of a wacom product.The multitasking feature is very nice as well. I use my tablet for work and find it really handy to be able to work between multiple apps, pull out the spen for a quick sketch of an idea, and then jot down a phone number - all with ease.If you just want a tablet as a \"media consumption device\", then I would suggest you take a look at a more value- priced tablet.

There is some question out there as to whether or not it does. Mine accepts with no issue a 64gb PNY SDXC micro. No reformatting, no special app, no nothing. not sure if they accept higher than 64gb. if they do, that's even better capability. i'm not a big fan of loading up on apps that get used once a month so keeping 10gb of space available inside with the remainder on the card is more than plenty for the average user. if this isnt enough you might want to rethink what you are storing. do you really listen to 25gb of music. probably not. there are also other wireless storage options out there now that might make for a nice pairing with a tablet if you really need more storage.If you are on the fence about \"useful\" tablets like i have been, this is the tablet to take you off the fence.

The only thing i didn't like abt this is the fact that it can be quite difficult to edit these files. But it does do it but just a bit slower than a computer.One thing I don't like about the tablet is the fact that the charging port is at the bottom and it is nearly impossible to charge and use it at the same time. The way I bypassed this problem is by taking my tablet out of the case and putting it back in upside down so the charge port is on the top. With screen rotation on, the tablet automatically adjusts. But this is is SUCH a hassle to do it every time I want to charge and use at the same time, which is pretty frequent. Like I said... there is always room for improvement.I will update this review as I use it more.As far as recommendations... I would 100% recommend this product to others.

In fact, if I had not been passing it along to my other half when they decided they wanted one, I would have kept that for a good long time. The new 2014 edition is great especially in the screen. It is beautiful. It is as beautiful as the Note 3 screen which I have as well. It is faster than the old Note 10.1. How much so from a noticeability perspective? For my stuff... not dramatically noticeable (to me). If your use cases are different than mine then you will probably notice a huge difference but most of my work on it is not too demanding. It is more about comfort and relaxation for me than a workhorse. Any time I have needed it to come to bat with power, it was not sluggish or cumbersome in any way and I feel like it would meet most if not all workhorse demands that could be thrown at it. There are a lot of improvements beyond the screen. Many aesthetic. The lack of onscreen menu and back buttons is a little tricky to get used to after having them before. It is a trade off, screen real estate used for content vs navigation being right in front of you at all times. A lot of new integrations and application improvements come with it as well. The build is of great quality and It feels very solid. I had a case for my old Note 10.1 and I would say it is required for the 2014 version. I could not imagine using this in any serious manner without a case. It is just too slippery to prop up somewhere, on something etc. To hold it, not very slippy but to lean it against something?

They transferred over in hard-to-read image blocks.", "Date": "January 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good Tablet for Those Wanting Productivity", "Author": "L. Orth", "ReviewID": "R32AELAF5YNULQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great tablet that a lot of the reviewers (as in professional reviews like cnet) don't cover very well. Most tablets are made mostly for consumption, but this tablet has a lot of productivity tools built right into it with most being based around the use of the S-pen, which is incredibly powerful. For my uses, this tablet can do enough to replace having to carry a laptop.S- PenFirst, the tablet can recognize script or print writing, and does a great job even with my terrible handwriting.  Samsung really did a good job with the recognition software. The pen also has rubber tip which provides a little drag on the screen in an attempt to simulate writing on paper. It's better than just a plastic tip, but doesn't reproduce the feel of a real pen on paper.I was actually somewhat concerned because prior to my purchase I tested one of these tablets in the store and the S-Pen was pretty worn down and dragged a lot. I was glad to see in the box that Samsung gives you 6 new tips for your pen. I do not know how long each tip will last since I have not needed to replace one yet. Also, if the tablet is sleeping when you remove the pen, then it will awaken and unlock for you.Air command, which is launched with the button on the S-Pen, is very useful and makes certain task more efficient. The Action Memo accessed through air command has become my favorite tool. I now start almost all Google Internet and Map searches from it. Of course, Action Memo also does other things such as allow you to jot down a quick note, add a task, start an email, or add to your contacts. One benefit of the Action Memo is that it opens in a small window over whatever you are looking at. Why is this good? Because if you are looking up or writing something from the document you are currently working on, such as a phone number, email, or address, then you can see the information as you write it in the Action Memo. Then it is just a quick click to map it or save to your contacts.The tablet also has an Active Digitizer, which is the system that tracks the S-Pen. With this system, when you are writing with the S-Pen, the tablet will reject any touches from your hand so you can rest your hand on the tablet while writing. It also allows the S-Pen to be pressure sensitive.Writing on the device is also good for meetings. I previously used my phone combine with MS OneNote in meetings to take notes, but people gave me looks like I was ignoring them and texting. Writing on a tablet looks more like what people are use to seeing in a meeting; people writing notes with a pen.Handwriting is faster than the on-screen keyboard in certain situations, and it is especially nice when you need to write out equations. S-Note can transform drawn equations into text and symbols. Handwriting also helps me remember and learn quicker, but I also like having a typed document for future reference. With this tablet I can hand write and produced text documents at the same timeNow, I have encountered a few issues with the hand witting recognition. It will sometimes incorrectly capitalize words and seems to do so really randomly. It will also put commas instead of periods if they are anything more than a dot. Capital I's are also sometimes interpreted as a 1 or a slash (/). Characters like 1 and I require you to add the additional lines so it is recognized correctly. Sometimes G will come up as an 6.On-Screen KeyboardThe tablet also comes with Swiftkey software installed, which works like Swype but also has predictive text (tries to guess what you will type next in a bar above the keyboard where you can just hit the next word). For typing, it is accurate and I have found it can be really fast. The predictive text is somewhat creepy how it can guess the next word you want. I have been able to type entire sentences just by hitting the words out of the predicted list.The tablet will try to correct words though, even in handwriting mode. I can be kind of annoying when you type out an obscure word and it keeps correcting it to what it thinks you meant.SoftwareTouchWiz, Samsung's front end for android, is good on this tablet, especially with the S-Pen integration. If you like your Samsung S3 or S4, then this tablet will feel right at home. I have not encountered lag to complain about and all the Apps I run operate smoothly. If you compare a pure Android tablet with TouchWiz, then you can see the \"lag\" when swiping between screens, but we are talking milliseconds here in difference.I also like the ability to turn on and off certain settings from the top pull down such as Wifi, GPS, and screen rotate. In addition, with the case I put on my tablet, when I open the cover it will unlock the tablet and open up a screen with your calendar and a drawing area that functions like the Action Memo. It's a really convenient feature to have that Action Memo immediately available.S-Note is pretty good, especially for handwriting and writing equations, but the tablet also comes with Polaris office which allows you to edit or create Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents. Since discovering Polaris, I have mainly been using it over S-Note. I haven't found a way to save files straight from Polaris to Sky drive so I use the Sky drive App, which works pretty well. I am looking into other options as well such as Google Drive and Evernote. Samsung also has Dropbox and gives you 50 Gb's of storage for 2 years when you purchase the tablet. I have not signed up for it so I cannot tell you about that process or how well it works.If you like to draw, then the tablet also comes with Sketchbook. I played with it some and the pressure sensitivity on the pen works really well. I am not much of an artist so I cannot comment on this program too much, but there is a wide selection of brushes and large amount of settings to fine-tune everything.Battery and ScreenI am getting good battery life out of the tablet. With Wifi connected and working on word documents, email, and internet, I can get an entire day out of the tablet. Currently, I have about ~5 hours of use on the tablet with screen brightness on Auto and Power Save off. The tablet is sitting at 52% battery.The big screen is also a reason I purchased this tablet. The larger screen gives you more area to work and makes the multi window functions actually worth using, especially the S-PEN air commands. I also have a phone (not a Samsung) with a large screen, so a smaller tablet did not feel like much of an upgrade over just using my phone.Other NegativesPrice - If you do not want the S-Pen or Productivity tools, then you can consider a cheaper tablet. Depending on what you need to do on a computer, it is not a full replacement for a full laptop, but that has more to do with the current Apps that are available, as well as how much more efficient a keyboard and mouse is (though you can use a keyboard and mouse on this tablet).Location of Home, Menu, and back button - The location can be annoying, but I will rotate the tablet so they are at the top of the screen.Speakers - While better than rear facing speakers, they do stick out the side. I feel I have to have the sound up much louder than required since they are on the sides instead of facing directly toward you on the front.Camera - You phone probably has a camera and taking pictures with a tablet is awkward, but it is there if you need it. I think of it more as a utility feature than anything else.Overall, I think it is one of the best tablets on the market right now for productivity. Since having a tablet that could function as a useful tool for me is important, I put most of my effort into finding a tablet that gave me those options. I would definitely repeat this purchase.", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "great tablet, but bluetooth doesn't work correctly.", "Author": "Hannah MacLean \"Hannah Happy Feet\"", "ReviewID": "R3D2562PNNWPIM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have had this tablet now since October 2013 (2.5 months) and I love this tablet. I use it frequently. However, my two biggest problems with it are 1) bluetooth doesn't work well at all on this tablet and 2) it comes pre-loaded with a lot of things I don't use, and that is built into the price. These are the reasons why I have taken two stars off the five. I have played with the bluetooth to try to make it work, and I have made sure that things that use bluetooth (i.e. keyboards) work with other devices... it is only this tablet which cannot use them. The problem seems to be that the bluetooth will be okay for all of thirty seconds when I turn it on, but then it stops working. To have to reset it every thirty seconds (if it works, because it often doesn't even do that) is aggravating to say the least. I am most disappointed in this feature because I had planned on using the 10.1 2014 with an external keyboard, and I can't.Otherwise, I find this tablet is lovely. It is my first tablet. I love the multitask function and use it relatively frequently. My primary use for the tablet has been for video chatting, as my fiancee and I live in two different states. I can use google video chat with other windows thanks to the multitask feature. Thanks to the new skype floating window feature on android tablets, I can also use Skype while doing other things on my tablet. The screen is beautiful; I use it any time I am looking throuh a large amount of photos because the picture quality is so high. I read some reviews complaining about battery life but I have to say I haven't had a problem. If the screen brightness is turned down, the tablet lasts for days (with moderate use) or for 3-6 hours while video chatting (if fully charged to begin with). The only time I've had a problem with the battery was when the brightness was turned all the way up while I was video chatting: this caused it to discharge while it was plugged in. However, when the brightness is turned down, it charges just fine while video chatting, albeit slower than normal.As a tablet, it's great, but I am quite irritated with the bluetooth problem, and I would have happily bought a cheaper, non pre loaded tablet over one with all the extras. I have a laptop that I use for word processing, photo-editing, and times when I want to have a lot of internet tabs open (happens a lot when planning a wedding!), but overall, this tablet has been and continues to be a great tablet. When I am without my laptop, this tablet is perfectly able to surf the web (and I can use stuff like the Pinterest app to keep track of things). It's definitely a powerhouse. I do wish though that SNote would allow me to create folders to organize my notes... hopefully some future update will include that feature. But, in the meantime, I am satisfied with this tablet, though I am stuck with the on screen touch keyboard, which is not my favorite.", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great tablet", "Author": "Adam Shrader", "ReviewID": "R29NVOU1L5PSUC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have completely fallen in love with this tablet.

Love the stylus.", "Author": "Emily", "ReviewID": "R3119DS3TXOUPJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After much waffling, I bought this tablet with a handful of specific purposes in mind. First and foremost, I am a musician and wanted a tablet to read music on. While I'd really prefer a larger screen in a perfect world, what sold me on this one instead of one of the (relatively few) significantly larger ones was the stylus. I need to be able to make annotations in my music the way I would with a pencil. Zooming in and then writing with my finger doesn't cut it when I want to be able to write in small markings like accidentals, breath marks, cues, etc, in the middle of a rehearsal. Unfortunately there aren't nearly as many music score apps for Android as there are for iOS, and they don't necessarily all take as much advantage of the stylus as I wish they did, but there there are some and I found what I needed. And there are more Android apps all the time.But regardless, the stylus makes a big difference and I think it makes this device a very competitive alternative to an iPad, even though more musicians seem to use iPads.Incidentally, the actual surface area of the screen is about the same on the Note 10.1 as on the full-sized iPad. I actually prefer the iPad's aspect ratio, but that's not such a big deal.In terms of reading music off of it, I still wish the screen was a bit bigger since I have to stand far enough away to not bang my instrument into the stand. But at the same time, I think it's easier to read smaller-sized notes off this screen than it is off of paper at the same size, and at least lighting isn't an issue.Second, I wanted something that could be a lighter, more compact alternative to carrying around my laptop, but something big enough to be reasonably comfortable for general internet use and getting actual work done without being frustrated about not being able to see enough of it at once. For that, it's perfect. The stylus makes even just web browsing easier because it's easier to click on small links than by poking with my finger. And being able to write in the text instead of typing on the \"imaginary\" keyboard on the screen is really great. I only wish you could do it any time there is a text box, instead of only in some cases, in some apps, or on some websites.Samsung did go to a certain amount of trouble to add stuff that the stylus is good for, some of which is useful, but even aside from that, to me the stylus just generally enhances the ease of use by more than I expected.Other odds and ends: the display looks really nice. The camera is good enough that I can take a photo of my music and comfortably read it off of that if I don't have time to scan it. People talk about the molded-fake-leather-texture back feeling cheap, but it feels fine to me. I don't really care about that; I put it in a case and don't really see the back much anyway. It's sort of annoying that the port for the charger is right at the bottom, which makes it awkward to use while it's plugged in.But on the other hand, that hasn't been an issue much because the battery life is quite good.So all in all, I've been very happy with it. So far, I'm satisfied with my choice of a device with a stylus over a device with a bigger screen.But hey Samsung! A Galaxy Note with a screen the size AND aspect ratio of a regular piece of letter-sized paper (or even just reasonably close) would be AWESOME!", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great tablet!", "Author": "Albert", "ReviewID": "R3AXPINWIDKMF8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very awesome tablet but if you dent think you will utilize the S pen than you Can probably get another Samsung tablet", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic!", "Author": "Cody Moorhead", "ReviewID": "RY9G2I3F6BOT2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This tablet is nothing short of great.

I mostly use mine for games, drawing, streaming Netflix, and surfing the internet. The S-pen is very comfortable and has a natural flow for me... I find it easier to use for drawing than my bamboo tablet for instance. As far as battery life goes, I have no complaints. The first day I had it, I literally played around with it from about 8:00 in the morning until 6:00 in the evening and only went down to 22% battery without being plugged in at all. I played games, drew stuff, downloaded a ton apps, and even watched a few of episodes of my fave shows. The screen is beautifully crisp and clear but audio is a little hollow. I usually use headphones though so it's a non-issue for me. I haven't had any connectivity issues with my wifi (802.11ac) and it's just as fast as my hard wired desktop. The weight is evenly balanced and not cumbersome at all. I also really like the leather look back... it's easier to grip than the super smooth plastics on most tablets/phones.If you're on the fence about it, I really think the big difference between this and other similar tablets available right now is the S-pen which is great for casual artists, writing, and more precise navigation. If you buy one, I would recommend watching some tutorials and reviews online just to see all the little features and tricks to get the most out of your 10.1.

Maybe I need to practice but so far I've been through the tutorial and have not gotten one thing to work as advertised with the S pen.  Select and search don't work at all, the scrapbook is clumsy and difficult to use - and I cant get it to use handwriting anyway, even if I select the pen.  Tried the autoselect with the pen: I tried to write \"Joy\" for the email receipient, never even got the \"J\" written (although I figured how to erase, plenty of practice doing THAT!)I like the multi window, but it is so-so. I used it to copy a picture to an email and send it.  That worked sort of - once I dragged the picture onto the email everything seemed to freeze for over a minute.  The .jpg wasnt that big, 100 KB or so, shouldnt have taken that long.  I can think of no other use for multi window as I dont usually play Candy Crush while reading a Kindle book, or look at my 401K and Facebook together or whatever.  I've had this ability for the last thousand years or so (slight exaggeration) on my PC and never used it there either.Anyway bottom line: I like this tablet but truthfully its not that much better than my tab 2.

I wish the \"menu\" and \"back\" capacitive \"buttons\" were closer to the outer edges to make them easier to use with my case, but this is only a minor complaint.  The fact that it (and the Note 3 phone) actually have a \"back\" \"button\" is so helpful, unlike the iPhone/iPad which does not have one.  I have no issue with the size or design/build of the stylus.  32G of internal memory, with the ability to add up to a 64Gb microSD card is far better than how an iPad designs their approach to memory.

I finally switched to the Galaxy S3 in 2012, starting with Ice Cream Sandwich. I upgraded to 4.1.2 Jelly Bean late 2012, and just received the OTA update to 4.3 a few weeks ago in early December 2013. Because of this, there wasn't much of a learning curve for me when using the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 edition. I also have an iPad Air (the new one released in late 2013).The Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 edition is model number SM-P600 running Android 4.3 Jelly Bean out of the box. According to Antutu, the CPU is a quad-core ARM v7 (VFPv4 NEON) at up to 1.9 GHz, with a Mali-T628 GPU running a screen resolution of 2560x1600 which is extraordinary given that the iPad Air is 2048x1536. In my review of the iPad Air, I noted that no other tablets come close to this resolution other than the more expensive Galaxy Note tablets. That said, I can't really discern the difference, they are both very sharp displays.The SGN10.1 has a 8MP rear camera, which is good but about on-par with most smartphones these days. The front camera is 2.1 MP and is actually rated for 1920x1080 resolution (HD). The SGN10.1 has GPS, Bluetooth, g-sensor, digital compass, digital gyrometer/accelerometer.The GPS works quite well for apps like Google Maps. I did not have any problems with Google Now or voice recognition on the tablet.The interesting thing is that in the latest Antutu Benchmark, my Galaxy Note 10.1 scored 33746, which was just under the Galaxy Note 3 in the rankings list which scored 34652. It looks like the biggest advantage of the Galaxy Note 3 is faster RAM. The SGN10.1 has 3GB of RAM, and this model has 16GB of internal storage. There is a micro SD slot for the ability to increase storage capacity. Android 4.3 is hokey with moving apps to the SD card. Apparently, the 4.3 OS views the \"SD Card\" as a separate partition of the internal storage, so none of the apps are actually moved to the SD card and continue to reside in the internal storage. The camera app will detect the micro SD card and automatically store photographs and videos on the external SD card.The stylus is easy to use and works fine even with a screen protector. I did not notice any delays that other people complained about. The stylus isn't a simple capacitive stylus, it is actually a pressure sensitive stylus with the same technology used in Wacom tablets. When the stylus tip approaches the screen, you can see a cursor hovering over the screen. It isn't a mandatory feature for most users, but as a doodler and engineer, I love this feature.The SGN10.1 has a really good on-screen keyboard. Even though it is the same Android 4.3 as the Galaxy S3 and S4, I noticed that the keyboard in the SGN10.1 has the numbers on the top row which is the same as the S4. This saves a LOT of time when entering passwords or when typing messages in general. As before, the Google Keyboard updates the key display to show shift modes and is much better than the static keyboard display in the iPad Air.The build quality and construction of the SGN10.1 is in my honest opinion, the weaker aspect of the SGN10.1 when compared with the iPad Air. The micro USB port is on the \"bottom\" of the tablet, right under the home button. On my Galaxy S3, this isn't a big deal. But on the SGN10.1, most tri-fold cases prop the tablet up with the port facing the table surface preventing you from keeping it charged while watching a movie. I have no complaints about the power or volume buttons and the home button looks and feels similar to the home button on my Galaxy S3.The speaker grill on the left seems kind of loose, while the speaker grill on the right is solid and tight. I normally don't complain about plastic housings, because I feel the aluminum housing on the iPhone and iPad is a bit excessive, but the faux leather backing and the chromed plastic bezel on the SGN10.1 just feel really cheap to me. If Samsung had just kept a smoother plastic backing and a more matte silver bezel, it would feel better IMHO. This isn't a very big deal though, especially when I use a Moko case which covers up most of these surfaces. The audio quality is not the best, but it is good enough.Many Google apps are grouped together, like Gmail, Google Now, Google Plus. Samsung apps like KNOX and S-Voice are also grouped together. The first time I tried to find Gmail, it didn't show up in the apps list which confused the heck out of me. Also, the main settings menu on the SGN10.1 are quite different from the Galaxy S4, which are also different from the Galaxy S3. I find it different, not necessarily better or worse.Pros: Same great Android 4.3 interface as other devices (Galaxy S3, S4, Note 2), Google Apps are exceptional at this stage with Google Now being quite an intelligent piece of software. Screen resolution and CPU/GPU performance are top notch.Cons: Battery life isn't the best, but with all this power comes with a price. I can easily see the battery level percentage dramatically drop within an hour of use.

Greer", "ReviewID": "R180MRHC1979U", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this when I'd had enough of the low RAM in my iPad3.  I was running into issues with iOS7 where the iPad would lag with too many apps open and only 3 web browser tabs could be active at any given time without them having to reload when you clicked back over to the tab.The first Galaxy Note was DOA.  Got audio but the screen did not work.  I tried everything and finally had Amazon replace it, which they did quickly.  The second one worked fine.Packaging:The device was packaged well.  Included were the Galaxy Note Tablet, the Pen, AC adapter and USB charging cable and a small users guide package I never opened.Setup:Once I got a working device, setup was easy.  Pretty much the standard Android fair.  Configure it for your wireless, put in your Google account info and you are pretty much good to go.Pros:*  The screen is great.  High resolution, rich colors and good contrast.*  The Samsung skinned version of Android 4.3 has some great features like split window with multiple apps running on the screen simultaneously.*  The Pen and built-in Wacom digitizer are a great combination if you are an artist.*  Games shine with the high end hardware on this device.*  Charges with standard Mini-USB connector.*  Pen could be good for taking notes if you get a good notes app (the Samsung included version is not good)Cons:*  Not a fan of the fake plastic leather backing.*  Samsung heavily skinned Android for this device.  While there are some positives, as mentioned above, there are far more negatives.  The interface can be very laggy when swiping or loading apps.  Double-tapping the home button brings up a Samsung app instead of the list of running apps.  Swiping up brings up a Samsung Magazine app and it is sensitive enough that I accidentally opened it constantly.*  Samsung chose to go with hard buttons, which are fine in landscape.  In portrait, however, the buttons are on the side.  This position is not only inconvenient and unfamiliar, but it also is where you put your fingers to hold it so you often accidentally hit the home button.*  Standby battery life is terrible.  For constant use, the battery compares to the iPad but in standby, you lose 15-20% of battery life over the course of a day.  If you have gotten use to leaving your tablet lying around unplugged, don't plan on it with this device.*  No LED battery charging indicator on the device or adapter.In the end, the cons won out and I sent the device back to Amazon for a refund.  Before sending it back, I purchased the Sony Xperia Tablet Z (http://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-SGP311U1-10-1-Inch-Tablet/dp/B00CE590Z0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1396645920&sr;=8-1&keywords;=sony+tablet+z).  While the specs of this device suggest it will be slower, that is not the case.  Since it is very lightly skinned, the performance is great.  It is also much lighter and thinner than the Galaxy Note and has much better standby battery life (comparable to the iPad).  To top it off, it is cheaper.  Unless you need the Wacom support from the Galaxy Note, I highly recommend you check out the Xperia Tablet Z...you'll be happier with it.", "Date": "April 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "The Best Tablet", "Author": "Eva Wilson", "ReviewID": "RMDTLSDUFZA97", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I Have Samsung Cell-Phones and appliances.

I've always been an Android guy, but I decided to give a Retina iPad Mini a try. I found that interesting and not as bad as I expected, but didn't care for the app ecosystem (overall usability was great though). So I exchanged it for this Note 2014 expecting the experience I would be happy with. After all, this is nearly the fastest Android tablet out right now. Before I was able to walk out of the store, a Samsung rep who worked at my Best Buy told me to stop by and have the firmware updated. A bit disappointing to have to let someone else open your new tablet, peel the sticker off, and then sit around and wait for it to update since it's not up to date out of the box.I was underwhelmed by the Note however. Comparing from the retina Mini, power on on the Note has a delay of 2-3 seconds for no reason - the Mini came on instantly, every time. Much like my Galaxy SII, the Note sometimes didn't register my PIN when I tried to unlock it. The screen is good, though the larger screen size used here doesn't make it as impressive as a smaller screened tablet such as the retina Mini (But different form factors I know, not really complaining here). I found myself disappointed with the quality of apps for Android tablets. Many were clearly scaled up from their phone versions and took no advantage of the increase in resolution. The YouTube app is particularly disappointing considering it's Google's own service and yet it is greatly lacking in user experience compared to the free YouTube player I downloaded when trying out the retina Mini MXtube (Which allows the exact resolution to be selected, downloading of videos to be watched later, and a very nice user interface). In fact, the most downloaded apps seemed to just be for emulators to play old video games on these which honestly seems like a waste of power for this tablet.Comparing cameras, somehow the retina Mini had better cameras than the Note 2014. Both the front and rear facing cameras on the note have a high level of noise and the colors go from being too blue to far too red. I find Samsung's photo \"helper\" modes to be largely more trouble than they're worth. Battery life is good, I never got it too low in the time I had it but I left it off the charger for an entire day idling with wifi on and it only lost 5% of its battery charge after 6-7 hours. During active use it seems to lose about 10% every 45 minutes to an hour, so pretty good for a 10\" tablet. The retina Mini did best the battery of this though, only losing maybe 5% in an hour of regular use. Both would last you through an entire day. Something annoying about the Note 2014 - it can't charge from a USB via a computer. You must plug it into an AC outlet with the adapter to charge it, which is very annoying to me as I use my Galaxy SII with my computer's USB port for charging and the retina Mini also did so without fuss.The big attraction for me was the ability to use multiple apps at once and to have a stylus. Disappointingly however, you can't just put whatever app you want in a window, only some apps are allowed to be put in a window. I use Dolphin browser for internet on Android and I am not able to use that in the window. In fact, the majority of my apps cannot be used with this feature which is a huge letdown. Unless you like running all the vanilla stock apps, the pen window feature won't be of much use to you. While I'm thinking of it, I wanted to use this also for remote desktop use occasionally - since I have a 2560x1600 monitor I figured it would be a perfect match. Unfortunately it scales the resolution down somehow, which seems disingenuous. I have many icons on my desktop, and the retina Mini only seemed to shift the location of two icons - remote desktoping from the Note 2014 shifted three rows worth of icons all over my screen (forcing me to redo my haphazard organization scheme). Very disappointed the remote desktop didn't do better (I used Microsoft RDP with a Win 7 machine).As far as taking notes, it's quite nice. You can choose multiple tip types and widths, and you can zoom in, select your text, resize and relocate it, and even convert math to formulas (Very hit or miss though, you have to print very neatly for it to work - my notes were never nice enough to use this feature when taking notes as I normally would. S note does a decent job ignoring your palm on the screen, however it sometimes does register while writing and will: zoom out, try to go to another page or treat it as a three finger tap (hides the toolbox - what a hassle figuring out how to get it back after I kept inadvertently hiding it). S note is not a very user friendly app, as it's difficult to figure out how to create a new memo in portrait/landscape mode (You can't change it after you've created it, you have to open S note and then create a new one from the template - and it doesn't reorient if you go from landscape to portrait or vice versa).I also discovered S note is very laggy at times, and I can't understand this on a tablet as powerful as the Note 2014. I had only two background apps on at the same time (Draw Something and my Lookout device protection) and I'd sometimes write and then see nothing. Thinking I missed the screen, I'd try again and nothing. Then it would finally write, so I'd try to keep going and then it was still lagging. It did this several times, which is very frustrating when you need to take down notes quickly. At one point I tried to create a new memo book so as to change the format, but didn't like it so I hit back and then hit delete - but it had selected the memo I just took all my notes in. It deleted it so fast I had no time to react, and there was no copy to be found on the device. Thankfully Evernote captured it in its trash section, I've seen horror stories of the Samsung backup not having the notes due to problems with their service syncing properly. Later I was taking notes and noticed it was lagging badly again, so this time I thought to clear my memory. I had just saved my notes and synced, but when I came back all I had was an empty memo. I checked and it apparently did not sync with Evernote, and didn't save the notes. When I cleared the memory it was actually using 1.89 GB of the 3 GB available, which I found shocking considering how little I had running on it - I've nearly run out of memory many times on my Galaxy SII with only 1 GB and I'm sparse on background apps because of this. I honestly can't believe Android can manage to use up that much memory, and I had no live wallpapers and only the weather and S note widgets running on my home screens. A quick note, I tried a few games and found some did ok but there were more than a few which had noticeable framerate drops. I know this isn't supposed to be a gaming tablet, but it's surprising that it has trouble with some of these titles considering the generally powerful hardware it has.That was the final straw that made me decide to return it. There was a lot of potential for this to be great, but it ends up being hampered by TouchWiz which is a clunky interface that bogs the device down and lots of unnecessary Samsung software which is honestly not very good. Some of my qualms are honestly with Android on tablets. The experience is not as smooth or full featured as it should be. So much of what you'll find is just a phone app running on your big tablet, which makes the screen feel like a waste. I also found wifi performance disappointing. Sitting at my campus with 3 out of 4 wifi \"bars\" I was having trouble connecting to the internet. I pulled my Galaxy SII out and got online with the same 3 out of 4 \"bars\" immediately. I toggled wifi off and back on and it seemed to straighten up, but hardly confidence inspiring performance from a device which should easily destroy the performance of my much older Galaxy SII.For the price you pay, this is not a good deal at all. If it were cheaper, perhaps it would be worth dealing with the quirks but this is being sold as a premium product yet suffers from limited software and disappointing performance. I still do not care for the iOS app ecosystem so I won't be getting an iPad again. After this, I am moving on to a Windows tablet - far less limitations with the OS available on the device (Even with RT). If Windows tablets don't pan out for me, I think I'll just go back to using a laptop - something like a Lenovo X230t which has the ability to be a laptop or a tablet (albeit a big one) offers far more capability and functionality without issues than iOS or Android. Both of those platforms seem excellent on phones, but I personally question their value on tablets. Personally, this is the last Samsung product I will be buying as my Galaxy SII has experienced regular lag, hang ups, and random issues for no reason and it is only a few months old (My original was replaced due to the microphone dying on it for no particular reason). I am disappointed in Samsung's failure to improve their quality, while many competitors are stepping up it seems Samsung is just beefing up the internals and reusing the cheap enclosures with the old TouchWiz interface which needs to be ditched.", "Date": "February 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "It's an awesome tablet", "Author": "Chromie", "ReviewID": "RX15I1ORPDW9X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This tablet is better than I expected.

I do agree with some of the other posts that it tends to get a bit buggy at times especially when there is more than one screen it sometimes goes a bit slow. I  am hoping since this is a new tablet that Samsung will update the system to remove the problems.  The only minor complaint I have is there is no app for Amazon Prime.In summary, I would say this tablet is for the adults and not so much the kids.  In addition, this tablet is expensive so I would suggest to get a warranty for it just to be on the safe side.  There are also classes at Best Buy to help those who are just learning the tablet for the very first time.  I wouldn't mind if there was an app for that either :).

I spoke with Samsung, they made me do a couple of factory resets and I had to re-install all my apps, one by one.  After I did the Factory Reset, same issue, Network Connection Problems.

Lewis", "ReviewID": "R3MIBE7BKVK20K", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I held off on doing a review on this tablet because at first glance I was severely disappointed/underwhelmed. I love the hardware on this device, if it weren't for 3GB Ram, the beautiful screen, and the S-Pen this would have gone back immediately. I stuck with it because I wanted to love this product.When you get this product it is SLOW and CHUGGY. I couldn't believe how poor the experience was! Maybe I am the only one who has experienced this as a search online turned up very few results. The other thing I noticed was the device is filled with bloatware- I don't need the New York Times or Travel Helper or whatever it's called. Words can convey how much stuff is packed on this tablet! I wouldn't care if the experience using the device wasn't so poor (because of being slow).Last night I had enough and installed a new launcher; I didn't even know this was an option! I installed Nova Launcher and wow- what a difference! It's snappy and extremely responsive now. If you get this tablet you absolutely have to change the Launcher because if you don't the experience suffers. When installing a third party launcher you can still use the S-Pen and S-Note apps. I don't know why you wouldn't want to switch at this point.Pro's:+ The hardware, I love how this feels in my hands. Just comfortable.+ The stylus and associated apps are very well integrated.+ Rooting is simple if that is your thing (I wouldn't know).+ Love the IR feature. No more pesky remote.+ Even Apple snobs take notice of this device.Con's:- Be prepared to do some work to get this thing working well (see notes above).- No NFC, so no touch to share with my Note 2.- Front camera isn't as good as it should be. Tablet designers should know that one of the basic use-cases for this device is video communication, what's the point in having an 8 MP rear camera and a 2 MP front camera? Seems like this should be reversed (who is taking pictures with this thing?).In conclusion, glad I kept this device. Despite all of my badmouthing I love it- just want Samsung to pick up the pace on the software side.EDIT: Sluggishness and choppiness seem to keep occurring. At times when tilting from horizontal to vertical the device will hang. Google Maps causes the screen to go black. The WatchOn app text is sometimes garbled. I want to also point out that Samsung is now pushing KNOX onto its products, which is a bad thing. Research KNOX before buying this device to hear what users have to say about it. I wish I could disable this program!With everything stripped down as much as I can (no animations, no frills, etc.) the device is \"just usable\". I have to work very hard to use this tablet. I have to restart the device periodically in order to get it to speed up. So the final verdict on this is \"stay away, far far away\".

It wasn't until I started reading that apple doesn't have flash and not really customizable unless its rooted. I love to customize my android device and the ability to go to websites that require flash. Also, this has more functions and the ability to add a micro sd card.  So all this was more convincing than the apple brand.  Now that I've had this for over a month, I'm so happy I got it.  I've customized it to my liking.  I can use the stylus pen for better precision when I need it. There may be a little lag here and there but it hasn't bothered me at all.

I experienced constant reboots and the tablet was frankly, unusable.  Though the two earlier updates improved it, I still could not stomach the performance issues so I exchanged it for another one.  I was still noticing occasional hiccups and reboots in the new model so I decided to take the following steps:1. Turn off all the animations in developer settings2. Reduced my homescreens from 5 to 3 with fewer widgets2. Deleted all sideloaded apps not gotten from the playstore (Like Flash player)3. And taking \"Lago's\" advice, I reset the tablet after updating it.I was really determined to confirm once and for all, if this tablet's performance issues were my fault or not as I was on the verge of returning it again and going for the iPad air.  Coincidentally, I did all that yesterday (Nov 1) and it appears a THIRD update was received shortly afterwards.Oh Boy! I cannot begin to describe how fast this device is right now.  I multitasked at a ridiculous level all night and did not sleep till 5am this morning!  The last time I experienced such smoothness and speed was when I had just bought my iPad 2, 3 years ago.  I will have to give all due props to Samsung for continuously rolling out updates to improve the device.  I am still a bit miffed that they had to do so AFTER I bought it, but the joy of using such a smart device compensates for that.  This is the BEST tablet on the market by far, right now.  I have reinstated my 5 home screens and widgets with no noticeable issue with performance.  I am still on the fence about sideloading apps though.  Any suggestions?  I really need flash for amazon prime on Dolphin browser but I'm afraid I might experience a drop in performance that will necessitate resetting all over again.In summary, I am not going to bother repeating what everyone already knows:  Best screen on the market, great battery life, Amazing S-pen, great specs (and now performance), Sd card slot, dolby sound etc.  These have all been said already.  I will rather continuously update my review to notify you guys of my experience with this device as time goes on.  This appears to be THE ONE; a tablet I am going to keep for a loooong time (3years?) and I am just hoping it turns out that way.  It is a 4 star because of the very slight, barely noticeable, hiccups in performance which do not in anyway hinder usability.  Also, there is an sd card issue mentioned by one reviewer.  I actually had to swap sd cards with my Note 3 and the one from the phone finally worked on this device while the one I purchased for the tablet is apparently working on my Note 3!  Go figure.P.s.  The notorious \"samsung fanatics\" (as they have been called) on this blog really need to get a life. You know yourselves ;) There are better ways of rendering constructive criticisms without being a D.bag about it.  Live and let live I say.

So what I do is I use the multi-window feature, putting PDF on the top, and S-Note on the bottom.I usually use the pencil style on S-Pen, with Dark-Granite textual background and white pencil color.It really feels like you can see all your textbooks and papers with you; and at the same time a blackboard to jot down something right underneath.2) The S-Note can go into what I'd call \"Note-Only\" mode, meaning neither menu bar nor tool bar shows, only the 100% pure note, so you can literally use it just like using a regular note.(After going into the edit mode) With 3 fingers tab on the screen holding onto it for about 1 second and then release, and it will go into that note-only mode, and write freely without having to worry about accidentally touching a menu button, and then tabbing with 3 fingers on the screen twice will exit you out of that mode (back to the regular edit mode).So far, this way of using my new Note 10.1 has been awesome for me.May the Lord God's blessings and grace be upon those of you using this note-tablet!", "Date": "October 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "DEFECTIVE UNITS - DO NOT BUY", "Author": "Alfred", "ReviewID": "R1TKHRD4FV7MTD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I will NEVER buy samsung products again.Same bluetooth issues as everyone else.

It also really prefers a landscape orientation than a portrait  orientation.  That is a problem, and its reinforced by the placement of the typical samsung menu and back buttons along the lower bezel of the device.  The pen is great but its not as comfortable to hold and write on the screen with the weight and orientation limitations.  I had a specific goal in mind of using it for note taking and pdf annotation.Sadly, most android apps for pdf annotation are not that great--Goodnotes for the Ipad is vastly superior, more reliable and faster.Software issues aside, the size, weight, and balance make note taking a little less than good for me.  Perhaps a note 8.0 inch or even a galaxy note 3 phone, due to easier portrait orientation, would be a better choice for pure note taking.The screen is AMAZING for video as the super amoled screen gives great blacks and the colors pop.  The micro-sd slot requires a lot of pressure to get the micro-sd card in--I had to use stylus--which I thought was odd. Perhaps my unit was defective so I did return it.You sort of also have to like touchwiz...which has its own pros and cons.Its a good tablet, but I think you have to hold it in your hand before you decide if it will work.

So, I was waiting for the new version so that I had something that was faster, lighter and had the latest OS changes - especially those supporting the S-Pen, which is why someone gets a tablet like this in the first place.I ordered the 10.1 (2014) the other week - it arrived, and I set it up. Was it faster? Yes. Was the screen gorgeous beyond words? Yes. Were the improvements to the pen support worth it? Yes. Am I returning it? Yes. Wait, what?Here's the reason for the return: for reasons that I can only imagine are related to Samsung trying to force the user into landscape mode, this is a tablet with physical buttons. The buttons are at the \"bottom\" of the tablet in landscape mode - which is a nuisance, but not a hindrance. It's when you put the tablet into portrait mode that things get funky...First, it's awkward. If you want to hit the home, back or menu keys, they are no longer at the bottom of the page, where android \"muscle memory\" tells you that they should be. You now have to reach your hand to the side, and punch a \"home\" button  - which is actually a very stiff button. Sounds trivial, until you do it a few hundred times. (If you have the tablet perched on a stand, forget it. Punching that button knocks it over every time.The worst offense, however, is when you use the tablet as it was originally intended: for taking notes or sketching. Using it for these purposes means (in my case) that I have the tablet in portrait mode and I am either in a meeting taking notes, or walking around sketching... in that position my hand naturally rests with my left thumb on the bezel...which is, you guessed it, exactly where the physical button was placed. I turn the application off and return to the home screen by accident 90% of the time.It's frustrating to the point of making me want to kick a puppy, so back it goes.I have no early idea (other than the one I stated at the beginning) why Samsung would return to the physical button that was abandoned when the world moved on the Android 3+ and higher. I know they have a UIX group, and I know they have a physical testing lab...how did this product decision make it to market? It's marred a tablet that I would have otherwise rated as a 10.

As a former Apple iPad die-hard, I truly believe that Samsung is winning the tech war. This tablet is no different. I could go through the tech advances here; but, I'll leave that to the other reviews. To be fair, I didn't get mine from Amazon, I got mine directly from Samsung. First, the unit I received was defective out of the box. It would not recognize micro SD cards consistently. It had a nice scratch on the faux leather back cover. And, the samsung hub app doesn't work on this device. This is a well known flaw. Go look at the play store comments on this. So the $50 credit you get to the hub is worthless. So, you might say, it happens and I am  just unlucky. That isn't the problem. Samsung customer support is awful, just plain awful. Instead of replacing a defective unit, I had to ship it back at my own expense so they could repair it. That's right. They ship me a bad unit and rather than replace it, they opened it up and fixed it. Having dealt with lots of gadget companies, the usual response is rapid replacement (think Apple). Instead, Samsung makes it as difficult as possible for their customers to get effective help. Their website is opaque; their telephone service is obstructive; and their replacement policies aren't customer friendly. They escalated my case but I never received a promised phone call from the supervisor. I would recommend the device; it is a tremendous piece of technology.

Unless I watch something black (screen) in dark room. Or updating OS ( black screen with green And-robot screen).My issue is that it has slight grey gradation At the top line under logo and left and right corner at bottom.First I thought it might be Samsung theme or effect, but even though I rotate screen. It always slight gradation.Since I noticed it, it catches my eyes more and bothered me. I was debating whether to return or keep it. But decided to say goodbye to my baby.When I asked my wife if she can notice anything on screen, she noticed that side so I can justify myself being not too picky.For the performance of the tab, don't expect super fast.Double price does not mean double speed.

I was able to show things on my screen on other device, but Tab was not able to find other devices.Buttons are too small. Hard to press. Volume control is awkward.

For small size files with several pages, no problem, but when it comes to pages like 900s.... laggy and hard to find what you need unless you already know where it is. S note app is critical for Note family. Need more work, I guess.Printing.From gallery, it shows an option for printing. It scans networking printer or usb printer if it is connected via usb cable.

After reading some forums many have it worse.  There is a great App in the Play Store that detects light bleed and/or dead pixels.  Just search for \"light bleed\" and it will be the 1st App.  Luckily I have no dead pixels.I like the tablet so much I'm going to keep it.

But to be honest, it just had much more than I needed or really wanted. If you want a mini computer, then this is perfect for you. Beautiful tablet with a lot to offer.What I didn't like about it:1. It was too big (which I thought I wanted) PS: The actual viewing size is not 10\", it is smaller...2. It is heavy and uncomfortable to hold and use. I was not expecting it be so thick and heavy so that was disappointing.3. Using the 'pen' was awkward, it is thin and shorter than a regular pen so it's uncomfortable to me. Using it made my wrist and hand really hurt after awhile, and the next day. So just be aware if you already have wrist and shoulder issues, it may cause you discomfort as well. Nice thing, you don't have to use the pen ;)4. Full of apps you do not need or want.5. Unable to use a lot of my Kindle Amazon apps, books, and prime account. So I was not able to rent (free for prime) movies or stream. This indeed was a deal breaker for me.6. Almost forgot about this, but the charging port is in the bottom and makes it very hard to use it while charging, especially when you are using a case/stand.7. Takes horrible pictures, but fine for video chat.So after all the months it took me to decide which tablet i wanted I ended up going back and bought the New Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" and glad I did. Wow, just perfect for me and I will do a review on it as well.What I did like about the Galaxy note:1. Easy to set up2. The size is nice, but needs to be lighter.3. Very good for games4. A lot of great programs for business and college, note taking, etc.5. SD slot for more storage6. Pretty good picture.7.

Samsung had my tablet for three...yes three...weeks. When I finally received the note back on November 26, it was too late for a return to amazon and the repair job that Samsung did was just awful!

I am not one of those people. I am a business professional who attends several client meetings and conference call per day. In my quest to be as paperless as possible, I was excited to read the specs of this tablet and envision using it for all my business notes.  In no particular order, here are my complaints about the Note 10.1 2014 edition:S Pen detection: The tablet is designed to recognize when the pen is removed from the silo and automatically take any of several actions from playing a sound to popping up a note app, etc. The table also vibrates when the pen is removed/replaced. After only a day of use, I found me tablet constantly vibrating as I handled it. I came to deduce it was the pen recognition going crazy at the slightest movement of the tablet. Bad build quality. OK, I thought, I'll just disable pen detection. However you cannot disable the vibration piece (only the popup app and sounds). So now, I have to walk around with the pen in my pocket ... not cool when you're spending close to $600 (after tax and ship).Charging: I have an iHome clock radio with a dock for my iPhone and an extra USB port on the back to charge my tablet. I just picked up my Note after charging it over night and it is at 7%. So the usb port by my bed is not adequate to charge this thing. Yes, I understand all about power current, etc ... but every other tablet I've charged there worked fine.Placement of soft keys: when holding the tablet in portrait mode, I am constantly hitting either the back or menu buttons. Also, because they are on the bezel and not on the screen, they are stationary and don't \"move\" with screen rotation.S-Note: The handwriting experience is SUPERB on this thing. However, the software design is just a bit off. Notebook management is difficult. However the deal killer for me is that you have to manually sync with Evernote. If you forget, then it won't auto sync. Why not just have an option to keep notes synced all the time?  And every other handwriting/note taking app on the android market looks like it was designed by student in an App Development 101 class at the community college.Android in general:  I am not an Apple fanboy. When it comes to my work, I just use the best tools I can find. Taking handwritten notes on an iPad is not feasible.  However, EVERYTHING else is just better on an iPad. The Android OS, although it has come leaps and bounds since its inception, still is not as polished as IOS. Sorry, but it's true. The biggest problem though is the apps. I don't need 80 millions apps for my lifestyle. I need a solid 20 maybe. News, Facebook, email, a couple games, check my stocks, etc.  With the exception of very fews apps, Android software is just not, well, beautiful, like IOS apps.  Facebook for android is a joke.  Zite, while visually appealing on IOS is plain UGLY on Android ... etc, etc etc.  Also, once you get used to multi-touch gestures on the iPad (four finger swipe, five finger pinch to home) - you'll never want to give it up.So, as for me, iPad is still a better choice for my money.", "Date": "March 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not Worth The Money", "Author": "amr88", "ReviewID": "RS8090J7Z6ZED", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have an S4 which I enjoy for the most part.

Pseudo-power users will not be happy with the device until they clear the standard OS and install a custom ROM.  Real power users would do that first thing anyway, and will then be able to enjoy the full power of the device.  Wherever you get it from, the crappy OS and bloatware will slow down (i.e., cripple) the device to the point of causing noticeable-to-severe lag.  That's absurd considering how unsophisticated and unpleasant the standard UI is.  Still, once you root it, the pen is a great capability lacking in other tablets which makes this one uniquely useful.  The size, weight, resolution, etc. are all good too.  The location of ports and buttons is annoying, and it does some weird things that apparently don't have disable options (e.g. the damn thing buzzes whenever you take the pen out or put it in, even when that notification is turned off...no manual rotation control...etc.).  My suggestion would be to lower your expectations a lot before you get it, then you will be less disappointed.

I like it better than my previous nexus 7 because of its capability and potential in productivity. If you want productivity (with a stylus too) this is a great option to consider... I love to draw and I like the feel of a pen or a pencil. That's something I wish the nexus had. Taking notes on Evernote is fantastic. Drawing on Sketchbook can also be equally satisfying. The stylus gave me that freedom I wanted as a creative type. The accuracy of the pen is what I was looking for! For me, all that the stylus had to offer and could do had me sold. The tablet is great in that manner.I was also drawn to the Play Store. I'm already invested in the Google play store so my purchased apps could easily sync. I don't want to buy the same apps twice and I don't have to. But one thing grieves me.The Bad:At times it tries to do too much. Samsung seems to want to take the helm with your experience and data. It has apps for everything with the intention of completing the experience. You just need to agree to it. But, I already have Google watching. I don't want another. The consequence? I don't think it responded well to foreign apps (like nova) or apps that I think challenge Samsung's intricate OS... So, at times it feels a bit pushy to my app preference. But, I have a Nexus 5 & had a Nexus 7 before this guy. That might explain my craving for a more relaxed experience.The thing is, I didn't expect to be pulled into so many things Samsung. That's what it is. It is a step into the Samsung experience, or a dive. Samsung has it's own app ecosystem waiting for you. That can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on you. I already have my Google app ecosystem and I didn't want to jump into another. So my denying Samsung's didn't make it the cleanest experience. Samsung is expecting you to use its apps and its store. They just want you to agree with what they believe is best. If you're up for that then more power to you! Go for it. It's effort to make things simple is there but it's persistence can be messy. There are quite a few agreements to make for app permissions (which bugged me) for apps I could care less about. The good thing is that there's always an explanation to what's going on along with a choice...And My Magazine... I don't know what Samsung was thinking with that.

(Not a very helpful shop I've discovered).  I contacted Samsung and the person Customer Service rep was just not interested and after explaining what we had done to try to remedy the problem was turning the device on and off, reseting the device and making sure it was charged all the way. The CSR then proceeded to ask me all the questions that i had just answered.. ? She was just a person reading from a list.I have now had to send it off to TX for it to get fixed which who knows when the device will ever get back??I'm a full time student and working full time and I have been using this tablet and has been a huge help! I had been writing all my notes on the device and now am rethinking this new approach of going paperless.What happens if this had gone out before an exam and all my notes had been lost.. ?So now I am rethinking how useful and reliable having a tablet for taking notes instead of writing notes on Paper.At least with paper I will always have a copy.I'm pretty disappointed though with Best Buy for not seeing that this is defective device and can't do anything about it.. I can understand if it was a broken device and was obvious but the device has been in a protective case since day one and has never been dropped yet and I'm a little nervous to pack up my tablet and send it out in hopes that they will fix it properly after seeing a few with other common issues.

Seufferheld", "ReviewID": "R2TT7JAB20G1FL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have owned this device for almost 2 months now and wanted to wait until it became a part of my daily life before writing about it.My review is based on my daily experiences and in comparison to iPad, as a former owner/user of generations 1 through 3 of that Apple device.  It was the update to iOS7 that caused me to look for an alternative that matched and, hopefully, improved on the iPad experience and the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition seemed to fit the bill at the time. I will not expound on the details of my disenchantment with Apple in this review.I give it 3 stars because it mostly meets my initial requirement of matching or exceeding the iPad hardware and feature wise as explained in the PROS section below, and I do not rate it higher due to the items that I point out in the CONS section.PROS:- Has a gorgeous display that comes very close to the retina display resolution of the iPad, and with a larger aspect ratio.- Has a powerful enough processor, GPU and Wi-Fi radio to render streaming video flawlessly and to run most apps smoothly, including multiple open browser tabs.- Has a good set of cameras and imaging apps, and the rear camera particularly takes excellent digital photos in good lighting conditions, albeit no so much so in low light or with the built-in flash.- Through Google Play it provides most of the app equivalents that one would find in the iTunes store, excepting of course those that are exclusive to Apple.  It also comes bundled with a fair set of MS Office compatible productivity apps.- The sPen feature has many possibilities, especially if you like to draw or illustrate, and the sNote and Daynote apps are useful and nice features - all lacking on iPad.  It is a true pressure-sensitive pen like you would find on a Wacom, and not just a capacitive stylus as you would use on an iPad, allowing you to rest your hand on the screen while drawing without affecting the app.- Considering how difficult it is to include good speakers in such a restricted environment as a thin tablet, this device has a couple of fairly decent sounding stereo speakers with good separation by virtue of them being placed on opposite sides of the device, as opposed to next to each other at the bottom or a single mono speaker, as in most competing tablets.- Has a micro-SD card slot that allows you to increase the device's memory by as much as 64GB, whereas iPad's memory is fixed in 16, 32, and 64 GB increments, each one costing $100 more (you can buy a 64GB micro-SD chip for about $50).CONS:My biggest gripe about this device is that Samsung seems to have rushed to produce an iPad-killer without taking sufficient time to conduct actual usability studies, and thus have produced a device that meets that sole criterion (evidenced by the fact that Apple is suing them for infringement) while ignoring how the actual user will ultimately interact with the device, to explain:- While the screen aspect and resolution are fantastic, in order to fit the 10.1 package dimensions Samsung has restricted the bezel on either side of the screen to less than 1/2 inch (7/16) which makes the device impossibly difficult to hold with one hand.  You find your thumb constantly touching the screen which causes all kinds of havoc with open apps.- The device has been designed to be used predominantly in landscape mode, with the camera and the home buttons arranged on the top and bottom of the long sides. This causes several problems, as explained next:- If you buy a protective case for the device, the fold of the cover will by necessity be located along the bottom of the screen (by the home buttons - the main home button being raised above the bezel, and the 2 adjacent buttons being touch-sensitive).  The first problem with this is that even though the cover will put the device to sleep through the magnetic latch, it will be awakened again if any slight pressure is applied to the cover (like when carrying the device with the cover closed) because the cover will press against the raised home button. Why Samsung chose to make this button raised above the bezel is beyond comprehension.  The second problem with a cover that is hinged at the bottom is that it makes the device even harder to hold with one hand while your thumb tries to support the added weight by the very thin real estate provided by the screen bezel and the rest of your hand is trying to keep the cover tight against the back of the device.  The final problem with a cover that fits this design is that if you fold it back to provide the angled support for typing or reading it puts the entire device upside down, with the cameras at the bottom and the home buttons at the top - very annoying!- Many of the Android apps are designed predominantly for the smaller (portrait orientation) screens of smart phones and thus do not rotate into landscape mode, which is how this device was designed to operate even though it does have a position sensor. This causes a devastating consequence when trying to use such an app on this device as you are now compelled to hold it by the side that has built-in touch-sensitive buttons and so you have to be constantly aware of your thumb placement so as not to active menus and other apps by mistake while trying to hold the device while using such an app - also very annoying!- Last, but not least by any means, are the many apps that Samsung bundles into their modified version of Jelly Bean 4.3 - apps that cannot be uninstalled and occupy a significant amount of RAM besides annoyingly launching when you don't want them.  The most annoying of these is a Samsung-modified version of Flipboard called My Magazine that is tied to the home button and launches constantly when you press it, even though you have never set it up or have any intention of ever using it.Would I recommend this device to a friend?  Yes, but only provided that I had explained all of the above and they understood exactly what they were getting, especially considering that this device costs $100 more than a comparable iPad.", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good Tablet, But expensive", "Author": "Armin Sadeghian", "ReviewID": "RU8UQNQFTD68", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall I would say it was a good gadget for its design purpose and the issues were not really significant to affect the user experience.

I found this to be the same even with this newer version. The bottom was very clicky especially near the s pen area. I loved how sharp and crisp the screen was when watching videos, viewing pictures, reading text and playing games. The speakers also sounded great and were placed nicely so that they could be enjoyed in landscape mode like they should be. When using the tablet in portrait mode i found it very easy to press the menu and back capacitive buttons. Also the placement of the home button was very awkward in this position. I prefer my ipad air in portrait mode since it is 4:3 ratio and is ideal for reading. On the other hand I really prefer the 16:9 ratio on the samsung for watching videos. The android platform is lacks the number of tablet apps the apple eco system has to offer. Im sure in another year or so google would have improved on this part. The iPad air is also much lighter and I got much better battery life. I love that the note tablet offers expandable storage, widgets, third party keyboards and being able to run 2 or more apps at once. Overall I found the samsung note 10.1 2014 to be buggy and not as fast as I expected it to be with its specs. I even installed nova launcher and disabled many apps like I have done on my samsung galaxy s4. Other things I didnt like include: the tablet seemed to get very warm at times even with light usage and no way to disable the magazine feature. Priced at $600 this tablet is bit steep in my opinion. Something closer to $500-$550 would have been ideal. Lastly I was hoping to use the remote app with the ir blaster for my entertainment system like I do with my samsung s4 but the app was really buggy and was not working right. Maybe this will be solved with an update in the future. Overall some really great ideas and hardware. I still prefer my iPad air for now. I hope one day I can switch to an android tablet when more apps become available and the quality improves.

The buttons, ports, cameras, pen holder, speakers, etc are well laid out.Neutral:+ Handwriting recognition is OK.

But aside from the improved screen, it does not feel that way in actual use.In actual use, there are a number of areas in which the machine is somewhat laggy (never horribly so).  Page swipes are one example (whether moving from page to page in a magazine viewed in the Zinio app or page to page on NY Times web pages.)  The lag seems to manifest itself in unresponsiveness (e.g. I swiped on the screen but the machine did not respond.)  However, once on a page, scrolling up or down is fast.I used the pen feature on the \"old\" version of the Note 10.1 to take handwritten notices and really liked the way that machine worked.  Accurate, quick ( keeping up with my writing was not a problem on the old machine) and it ignored my palm resting on the screen as I wrote.Despite the improved specs on the 2014 edition, the S Note app just does not operate as smoothly.  My palm resting on the screen was not ignored as well as on the old version.I did compare the machine against my iPad2.  Overall, the Samsung is a faster tablet at doing some things but is nowhere near as smooth or polished as the Apple system (including the apps.)  The iPad rarely ignores swipes in apps such as Zinio but the Samsung does.  (I cannot tell whether this is a defect in the Samsung interface (TouchWiz) or Android or the Zinio app.)My hope is that through software upgrades the potential of all of this hardware will turn be realized and the functionality of the old Note 10.1 means it is realistic to expect Samsung to do the same thing here.My intended uses for the machine (aside from note taking) are basically content consumption (magazine, books and movies).UPDATED (11.1.13)I decided to return the item and will buy a refurbished version of the old model (the 2012 version of the Note 10.1).  The stylus remains a significant and worthwhile differentiator over the iPads so there are some uses of tablets that work better for me on the Samsung as opposed to the iPad.  However, the iPad universe of quality apps (particularly ones that have desktop equivalents on the Mac) is richer than the offerings on the Android platform so that platform remains my first choice for consumption focused tablets.I will reiterate that throughout the period of ownership of the 2014 tablet, the iPad2 did work better on a number of apps that I use frequently (such as Zinio).", "Date": "October 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Be forewarned Samsung states that there is no compatible keyboard", "Author": "Grateful Dave", "ReviewID": "R3FZAJAEY7PMLB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "To be honest, I haven't gotten my tablet yet and will update this review later, but after reviewing all the reviews on keyboards here and at Best Buy, Newegg, and several android forums, the Bluetooth problem is pretty extensive.

The rear camera takes exceptional photos, the touchscreen produces brilliant images, and the audio was way above average.  It was pretty much everything anyone could want in an Android device, and it really disturbed me to have to send it back, but send it back I did.  The home button is an actual, physical button you have to push, while the back and widget buttons are digitized.  The problem is that it is virtually impossible to hold the tablet in landscape mode without constantly bumping those buttons.  There is literally no frame around the screen that you can hold without interfering with the operation of the tablet.

Meanwhile I got a Samsung Note 10.1 2014 Edition to see how good it is compared to the jPad, as I have  samsung galaxy S4 cellphone. I was disappointed with the Note, it has a fast processor but the interface and scrolling is not as smooth as my iPad, the scrolling is somewhat jerky and frankly very annoying from a $600 DEVICE ! I was not expecting that. The virtual keyboard is also not as smooth and a accurate with lots of mistakes but not too far behind iPad.The user interface is generally not as polished and user friendndly as the iPad either, another disappointment. For example, the cut and paste functions are a lot more functional and intuitive on the iPad, the Note falls short. Cut and paste should be the simplest and most intuitive of functions, shame Samsung dropped the ball on that, as I had high hopes for Samsung after all the over hyped reviews for it.On the plus side, it is lighter and screen is a bit brighter than the iPad, but thats about it so far. I still need to explore the Samsung further, but after a week of use, I'm NOT I m pressed for the price they charge.So if you want the smoothest experience, iPad is still my recommended choice.If you want a little extra functionality that Note offers a little more.UPDATE: 1/26/2014After a week with the Samsung Note, I'm disliking it more and more due to the bad GUI interface. The touchscreen is horrible, general usage is clunky, just a bad experience. If you have a lot of music already in iTunes, there is no iTunes App for Android, so I can't easily get to all the iTunes music I have already paid for which sucks big time.

I'll start off with the cons, because most people already know what pros this tablet offers, manufacturers don't advertise their cons.I really wanted to like this tablet, in fact I'm probably going to come back in a few months to see if they flattened out the manufacturer issues. For now, it's unacceptable.|||SUMMARY|||Build quality: 1/5Aesthetics: 4/5Features: 3/5Value: 2/5Reliability: 2/5Overall: 2.4/5_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________|||CONS|||-Horrible quality control on Samsung's part. While I mildly welcome the newly redesigned look of the tablet, with the faux leather back, there are many flaws with the casing. The metal speaker grills on the sides of the tablet are loose, if you tap on them, they will rattle and move. I don't think they'll fall off, but it probably would've been a better idea to have the grills cut out from the casing itself. If you apply pressure to the left hand bezel when holding the tablet in horizontal mode, the plastic creaks and depresses slightly, which is cause for concern. In some models, there are scratches and mis-molded plastic on the faux leather back of the tablet. You're probably thinking I just got an unlucky product, but I've actually bought and carefully inspected five Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition tablets. Yes, FIVE, that's how much I wanted to like this tablet. I would dismiss these issues if the tablet were low end, but this tablet is one of the most expensive android tablets on the market currently, and there is absolutely no excuse for such an atrocious level of quality control. It is standard protocol to check a few samples out of every manufacture batch, five minutes with this tablet and it is obvious the manufacturing process should be better tuned. This tablet actually costs $50 more than the iPad Air, which is often considered \"overpriced\", yet the iPad Air has impeccable build quality and Apple nearly always does a perfect job at quality control. If Samsung wants to charge the same prices as Apple, they need to step up the quality control. The Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition is better than the iPad Air in almost every aspect, and it pains me to see such manufacturer defects.-Cheap materials. This is a $550 tablet folks, it should not be made out of plastic. I would much appreciate if Samsung had replaced the faux-chrome accents and replaced it with brushed aluminum, it would complement the faux leather back so much better. To be honest, I'd be happier if they ditched plastic altogether and had an all aluminum build, give it a nice sleek look.-There is a noticeable graphics lag present when flipping through the homescreens, especially if you have a lot of widgets. Not that bad of an issue, this is easily remedied with Nova Launcher.-The S Note app is very laggy and buggy, I attribute that to the software aspect of the app, and not the hardware in the tablet. The S Note app is the main app I use and it's kind of disappointing to see such low-quality coding and software optimization. Sometimes when starting up the S Note app, it doesn't recognize the pen, or it would just crash, which is very embarrassing when in the middle of an important meeting. I'd also like to mention that the Exynos processor in the tablet isn't actually an octacore processor, but two quad core processors. One running at 1.9GHz and the other running at 1.3GHz for power conservation purposes. I suspect the tablet often hiccups when the two processors hand off processes to each other.-Another bone I have to pick with the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition is that there is no microusb 3.0, which the galaxy note 3 has. They came out at around the same time, and to be honest, the tablet needs microusb 3.0 much more than the phone does. This tablet has a huge battery and it would be nice to charge faster.|||PROS|||-The sound quality on the built in speakers are phenomenal, they are very loud and the sound is clear. Perfect for watching movies or YouTube videos, or listening to music.-I'd also like to note that having an active digitizer is great, in fact, I don't buy tablets that don't have an active digitizer because I tend to take a lot of notes. The Galaxy Note 10.1 is one of the few android tablets that have an active digitizer and I love it.-The battery life is decent, I can get a full days use and maybe more if I don't put it through heavy use.-The screen is great, the resolution is nice and the quality of the screen is probably better than a retina iPad.-Having dedicated navigation buttons means that there's more screen real estate to be used for media and writing notes.-The reading mode of the tablet adjusts the contrast when reading books or articles so it's easier on your eyes.", "Date": "November 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Device is Good, but Warranty Service is Horrible", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R32A1HJT9OEFID", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The device was working great for a while; really loved the weight, the feel, and the S Pen.However, after 5 months of using it for about 2-3 hrs each day, with maybe an hour or so worth of writing with the S-Pen, the tip broke off.

Unfortunately, I found this tablet to be slow and clunky even after the updates. I figured this had enough power and speed to bypass apps like amazon or ebay but forget it, by the time you click on a link, the page shifts and you find you clicked on something else that loaded lastly. Very annoying and very disappointing.I also own the note 8 and i feel the display and readability are both the same. I do not see a higher quality screen as compared to the note 8. I will keep my note 8 but I am sending the note 10 back to amazon. This is bulky, clunky and slow as compared to my note 8. It doesn't make sense to me but that's my finding.I thought this would be great for school, but nope, ill stick with my 3 year old sony vaio laptop which is much faster and versatile. If you think this will help you as a student, I would suggest pen and paper instead. By no means will this replace paper as some suggested. If they can adapt to this slow overpriced monstrosity, then all the power to them.My note 8 I purchased for use in school and perhaps substitute paper and pen with but that's not the case either. I pretty much use it to reference material that on lecture or just entertainment since its so small. I've then left it home since its pretty useless in school as well.Anyway, if you are a student considering to replace pen and paper, this is definitely something that WILL NOT perform that task. Stick with a nice small laptop and you will be just fine.Now if you just want to goof around and have time for this thing to load and browse with at home or something, that's just fine but i would spend the money on some other popular brand and leave this one on the shelf.

Caldwell \"SMandracia\"", "ReviewID": "R18H18TJIQKXOH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have owned this for three weeks and I'm going to be returning it.  I was shocked at the performance.  It hangs from time to time and it's relatively slow lots of the time.  The stylus is buggy and every time I have used it I end up putting it away in frustration and just using the onscreen keypad.  The bloatware is massive and there is very limited support.  It's very hard just to figure out what most of this stuff is, much less how it is suppose to work.The worst issues are the battery and the sound quality.  I wonder if Samsung has production problems because I have seen several reviews saying that the sound quality was excellent, and others talking about loose speakers and poor quality.  On mine the sound quality was really bad.  Like an old AM radio in a '68 Chevy pickup bad.  It put out a tinny, thin sound that was irritating.  My Samsung Galaxy S3 phone on speakerphone was similar enough that I could not tell them apart.  With headphones, the sound is great, so the problem is the speakers.You can literally watch the battery drain as you use the unit.  There is a power save setting, but even with that on it drops 5% every 20 min or so.  Mine also lost 5% of the charge overnight with the unit completely turned off.  The Settings app does not give you access to whatever apps are running in the background, so you can't shut them down to save battery life, or even tell if that is the problem.  There also does not seem to be any way to delete apps that you don't want.  Several screens are taken up by Windows 8 - like tiles that you can't get rid of or replace with apps that you actually use.Also, the stylus will not work with a screen protector.  The stylus will snag and just not read on the screen through the protector.Tablets are basically toys and entertainment devices.  But this one was promoted as something that would help you be productive with actual work.  It doesn't.  I have found myself using my phone for most of the things I had thought I'd use the tablet for.Last, the support from Samsung is pretty much nonexistent.  With a lot of persistence you can find a users manual (250 pages in a pdf file).  Why this is not included on the tablet when you buy it is a mystery, except that the layout of the manual is so bad that you may find solutions faster through trial and error than by digging through the manual.UPDATE:  My son bought the same unit as above.  He downloaded a Task Manager so he can turn off apps and that seems to  help the battery life problem.  The handwriting recognition software was not on the unit, and had to be downloaded and installed, but it works very well.  He has used it for about 3 months and he would not buy another one.  Although the handwriting recognition is good, it is slow and can't really be used for class notes.  He and I both found the Air Command, Samsung hub, and TV remote features to be useless.  So, he basically uses it like any tablet, for email, web, Netflix, and occasionally reading a book.  It is sluggish when paging through a document, but it works.

I have to say that for what I payed for this device I was hoping for something with a little more...something.Let me start by saying I am an self professed geek,  and I have owned many android devices: but never a Samsung before and probably never again. I returned my Surface 2 since the app selection with Microsoft was less than sufficient, and got this 2014 edition. I was greeted by the abhorrent TouchWiz launcher, that was immediately replaced, and this system lag that ruled over almost every application including exiting apps and returning to the home screen. The \"cool\" features like multitasking and the S Pen are vastly overrated and/or are not actually usefull due to limitations. Overall the whole UE this tablet provides feels incomplete and sluggish and will not give you with the smooth operation of a new iPad Air or even my old Surface 2. Inside, 3gb of ram which is above industry standard  is still somehow not enough, coupled with the quad core Exynos i was expecting more bang....but this beast has been tamed by software.Then there is the subject of the materials, I won't go into great detail since there are many reviewers hating on the plastic that samsung uses instead of alum, and then there's the 'faux leather' texture on the back *insert eyeroll*. Suffice to say it is seriously lacking in refinement. There are audible creaks and cracks when handling the device, the added weight of using alum would have been welcomed.However, I am able to surf the web, read emails, and watch Netflix on its beautiful display.

As a bio-major, I find myself taking about 20 pages of notes a day. Looking up videos on YouTube, S Note seemed like a viable option to keep all my notes together and write notes effectively during lectures, while keeping up/being ahead of people writing their notes with pen and paper. However, after spending almost $600 on this tablet, I was EXTREMELY disappointed to find out that some of the key functions of S Note that made it so reliable and effective are now gone.Some of these features include:-switching to various presets by clicking the button on the stylus (which made it much easier to write/highlight as you go. This is now replaced with air command)-handwriting to text recognition on the actual page itself (Completely disabled now, \"productivity tools\" no longer exists. Almost half of your notes will be covered with a keyboard/pad that you will write on)I honestly found S Note almost completely useless for taking notes, which was the entire reason I bought the tablet. I also didn't like that you're conformed to writing in a line on the pad that you have to write on, which makes it an inconvenient, lengthy process to add bullets to notes, etc. It also didn't help that while writing long sentences, you usually have to pause half way through so that the pad clears up so you can continue writing. There's sort of a ruler at the bottom of the pad that is supposed to slide the pad as you write, so you don't run out of room. I found it useless 10/10 times.There's a few good things that I'd mention about it that I like more than its predecessor:-Sharp display makes for a nice viewing/editing experience for PDF files (i.e. eBooks)-New layout of the applications are very aesthetically appealing-Haven't experienced any lagIf someone was able to prove me wrong on the features I mentioned above that are now absent in S Note, please let me know. However, the Samsung representative at Best Buy even confirmed those missing features when I spoke to him today. I actually really wanted the tablet, I love the display, but the way everything is setup in S Note now makes it for a very ineffective note taking experience.Why buy a tablet specifically made for taking notes and pay almost double the price of its predecessor while its note taking capabilities are more limited than its predecessor?I don't want to sway anyone from purchasing the tablet, I'm just stating the changes in S Note. You can always use a different application to take notes. My favorite just so happens to be the one with the most changes =/", "Date": "October 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice screen, but NOT a productivity tool unless all one does is scribble and read", "Author": "JedRider", "ReviewID": "R1FDVV244HY7TO", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This was my first tablet and not a real good experience:1.

I can see the pixels. I was lying in bed with the tablet with my face quite close to the screen and I noticed how the icons at the bottom and the charging level indicator were not smooth. So I got out the iPad 4 and compared side by side. I cannot see the pixels on the retina iPad screen but I CAN with this. It is still a lot better compared to previous tablets or phones but cannot match the iPad's screen. Because the PPI is similar, I am assuming this has to do with the type of screen but maybe someone can elaborate?2. No touch gestures. It is frustrating to go from the iPad's intuitive gestures to absolutely no gestures. Having to take my fingers off the screen to touch a button to go back to the home screen or switch between apps is annoying. I believe iPad has copyrights on its gestures but surely they can come up with some unique gestures. I know some launchers have gestures but perhaps someone can tell me if they are as good of experience as the iPad.These two things are annoying. But there are some things I do like about the Note:1. I like the plastic backing. I prefer the plastic build vs the metal one of the iPad. The iPad metal enclosure feels cold and I don't like that. It also feels lighter.2. It is good for going paperless. It has a SD card reader and I like the fact there is a file system that you can access so you can organize your files in folders easily.3. I prefer the Android OS for a number of reasons.Overall, it is a good tablet. If this tablet were $100 cheaper, I'd give it 4 stars.Edit: Also, this is my first experience with the S-Pen but I feel it is a bit laggy. I write pretty quickly and this couldn't keep up.

This was my first Android (or any other operating system) tablet. I have had it now for about three days, and will be returning it to Amazon after the weekend, minus many hours of grief.1) Device arrived.  Opened box, looked at the instruction booklet. Yes, I read instruction booklets. This one though has difficult to read black type on a stack of brown paper, each page about the size of a playing card. What a silly way to have an instruction booklet. They should have left it out, I got something useable with a web download.2) The tablet felt heavier in my hand than I expected. My error, it is typical of high end tablets, I was just surprised at the feel.3) The screen gets oily from fingers really fast.  Kind of disgusting in fact.4) The instructions said \"Before first time use, fully charge the battery.\"  There were pictures showing how to hook up the charger to the tablet and a wall outlet. It was not clear whether turning the tablet on was first time use or whether one could turn it on but just not play with it.  In any case I plugged it in and nothing happened. Seemed strange, one would think there should be some indication that the thing was charging. I contacted Samsung and through a chat with a technician we worked through a variety of things, switching cables, plugging into a computer. Finally an icon appeared, and that was supposed to be the signal that it was charging! But the icon just as suddenly disappeared. The chat person disappeared too, claiming that I had exhausted my time.5) I still needed to know when the battery was fully charged. The technician said \"six hours\". Seemed like a long time, but that is what I waited. Not sure why the instructions would hide this fact. The technician did not seem to know whether \"Before using\" meant before turning the tablet on the first time or before using the tablet, i.e. going through the setups.6) Once the six hours were over I turned the tablet on and it worked.  I think the problem with the \"charging icon\" was that the screen was automatically shutting down after a few seconds. I don't know, I set the screen so that it would say on for much longer. I am sure this will cut battery life, but otherwise constant shutting the screen while one was trying to do something was irritating.7) The number of applications and capabilities of the tablet was overwhelming. I had to set up cloud things I had only heard of and did not plan to use. Ordinarily with a new Windows desktop or laptop I know how to get rid of all the bloat and just start adding software one by one.  I used to curse Windows for not giving the flexibility I wanted, without a lot of effort. But that was before I was exposed to Android.8) Take the simple task of adding wallpaper.  Fairly straightforward, either from reading the instructions or just playing around. Except that the choices are very limited, none appealing to me. What I wanted was a very dark gray background. That is what I like, what ordinarily might be classified as \"none\" on a menu. Could not find it, went on the web searching for what to do, was directed to \"free\" wall paper sites that had even worse wallpaper and I never was able to navigate through the sales pitches to download any. There was no information I could find about where \"wallpaper\" was stored in the device, or the dimensions of the graphics required. I ended up doing something in a graphics program on my desktop computer and then emailing it to me on the tablet, as an attached file. Now I have to get the attached file into something called the Gallery folder, and then should be able to choose it as wallpaper. But really, that much effort, just to select wallpaper that is essentially no wallpaper?9) The microSD slot has a cover. Good luck opening it with a standard male fingernail. Once you do get it open all you can think of is that if you have to do it more than a few times you will certainly break it. The instructions call for sliding the card gently into the slot, until it seats with a click. Typical. Only it did not seat. Again, my fingernails were not long enough. I did finally get the card to stay deep in the slot, and closed the door.10) The MicroSD was not recognized by the tablet. Instructions told me what to do to \"mount\" the card, but they did not work, that is, I followed the instructions until I came to a screen that did not have the menu option the instructions said would be there.11) I removed the MicroSD card. That was a job, again unless you have very long and thin fingernails it is extremely difficult. But I managed to remove it, and the screen did show a message that the SD had been removed. I reinserted it and removed it several times, but still was not able to mount it.12) I like the stylus feature. I like the fact that whenever you get someplace and you can't figure out how to get out of it you can press a \"home\" button that takes you home. I like the fact that it picked up my home wireless network and I was immediately and simply able to log on.  The screen is great. Writing with the stylus is great. Even typing on the virtual keyboard with my thick fingers worked well.  Maybe if I were in my teens and had lots of hours to play with the tablet to learn how to do things I would be happier with it, but already I have wasted many hours trying to straighten out the battery charging, and still haven't fixed the microcard problem, after many hours. Maybe some day in the distant future I will try again, but for now I am finished with it.13) One, two, maybe up to 10 icons are useful. But so many icons for so many applications, I feel like I am in an Egyptian tomb trying to decipher things.", "Date": "November 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Caveat Emptor", "Author": "A steady customer [100+ purchases]", "ReviewID": "R33GK9XO4ZZEUO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Once I understand this device, I am sure it will excel.

While I am not an Apple \"fan boy\", I currently use an Iphone 4 and am very happy with my Ipad 2.  I was very unimpressed with Apple's new phones and heard wonderful things about the Samsung Galaxy 3 and the Note 3.  Because I wanted to know more before I committed to a new operating system for my phone, I opted for the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition as it has the operating system and style closest to the Note 3.I'm pretty disappointed.I've now spent about 6 hours trying to understand the Android operating system.  I don't mean I was staring blankly at it, rather that the system is not very intuitive.  Maybe it's just the years I've spent with Apple, I understand how to get to what I need.I really wanted to like this device.  To be able to say, \"Wow!  This does \"fill in the blank\" so much better than Apple\".  But I can't.  I can't find one thing of importance that this device does that the Ipad does not do better.  Am I missing something?  Definitely possible.  I have noticed that Android's app selections are nowhere near as robust and diverse as Apple's.  That's pretty disappointing.There is still an awful lot I just don't understand about the device.  I don't understand what benefit there is to a stylus.  It seems to harken back to the old Palm Pilot days.I love the fact that there is an expansion slot and yet for as nice as that is, the awkwardness in trying to delete an app or change a setting really seems to mar the overall experience.I'm 46 so it's not like I'm standing on my lawn, shaking my fist and yelling for kids to \"get off my lawn\", that being said, this product makes me scratch my head.
