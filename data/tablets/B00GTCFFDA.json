{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Sony Xperia Tablet Z: A Strong Contender for Best Tablet", "Author": "R. Voorhees", "ReviewID": "R3TYRJJY1OG31J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I HAD to have one of these as I've been looking for my ideal Android tablet for some time, and so far, the majority of the pro websites have given the Sony Xperia Tablet Z very positive reviews. Not wanting to wait several weeks, as Amazon states for their shipping times, I bought one straight from Sony...and I couldn't be much happier! Just about every tablet I've tried has had defect issues, build issues, too low screen resolution (or underpowered when it was hi rez), etc., etc. Although it's not perfect, with everything I'd LIKE to see in a tablet, I think it's overall the best tablet currently available.BUILD:I know it's been said in many reviews, but seriously, this thing is amazingly light and well balanced. At roughly the equivalent in weight to an iPad Mini, it's a remarkable feat of engineering. Yet it's also quite solid and exceptionally well made. There is no tablet lighter and thinner than the Z...period.SPECS:Powered by a quad-core Snapdragon processor, the Z scores a remarkable Antutu benchmark of 20,000+ straight out of the box, readily defeating the Nexus 10. That's some serious power, and it shows in smooth and responsive controls, whether surfing the web, running apps, or playing graphic-intensive games. The GPS locked onto 15 satellites INDOORS within seconds using GPS Test. WIFI is rock solid and supports dual-channel wireless speeds of 300 mbs. It links up with a PS3 Dual Shock controller through a USB host adapter at first, then wirelessly after being paired with the tablet. It has a Micro SD card slot for memory expansion up to 64 GB. It even has a built in FM radio for heaven's sake. The IR remote control works very, very well, and the channel guide with show descriptions and pictures is a great added feature. And the ability to \"throw\" the channel to your TV with a simple swipe is pretty cool. And although Sony claims that the WIFI mirroring of your tablet screen is a feature for Sony smart HDTVs, it worked perfectly with my LG TV, much to my surprise. I really haven't had the ability to test out the NFC capability, but I suspect I will eventually as the standard is more widely adopted.SCREEN:Hands down, the Sony Xperia Tablet Z has the most vivid screen of any tablet I've seen, including the Transformer Prime, Nexus 10, and Apple iPad 4, thanks to the Bravia 2 engine, the same used in Sony's HDTVs. It's simply stunning. While not as high of a resolution as the Nexus 10 or iPad 4, I personally think the difference is hardly noticeable in side-by-side comparisons. A Matte finish would have been great as the screen is glossy, but no more so than the other tablets out there.SOUND:Sony touts the sound as a primary feature of the tablet, and for the most part, it lives up to the hype. The 3D surround is decent, although I have to say the Galaxy Note 10.1 still has the best overall stereo and 3D sound with its forward facing bezel-lined speakers. Still, the Sony sound is plenty loud, and full of nice enhancements and equalizers for fine tuning. I have to be honest and say that I was slightly disappointed in this regard, as the overall sound feels hollow, no matter how you adjust it. Not nearly as rich as the Kindle Fire HD's powerful speakers. But still, it's a tablet after all, and headphones are the way to go, with full surround sound support that's REALLY nice in every respect... something I don't think any other tablet features.CAMERAS:Sony made a lot out of the use of its EXMOR low light sensors used in the front 2 MP and rear 8 MP cameras, but at this point, despite it's plethora of features and adjustments, I find the results to be disappointing when used indoors...where you'd think the sensors are best suited. The result is noticeable graininess, even in fairly well lit indoor areas. Outdoors? No problem. Nice, crisp, well saturated photos and video that are as good as you'll get on any tablet. But why manufacturers can't use the same cameras as their smartphones is beyond me. Anyway, I have to say that Burst Mode is really cool. I got some awesome hummingbird photos while sitting on the back porch. I'm hoping Sony can wring out better results with firmware updates down the road.ANDROID OS:A lot has been said about the fact that it's running an earlier, skinned build of the Android OS: 4.1.2 as opposed to 4.2.2 on the Nexus 10. But honestly, the added Sony specific features are largely well implemented while keeping the experience true to the standard Android OS. Sony also stated that they'll have a 4.2 update \"soon\", but we'll have to see how that pans out.HEY! IT'S WATERPROOF!Although this may not be a selling point for many, it does open up some places for use that no other tablet offers, at least without some trepidation, like at the pool, spa, bathtub, or in the rain. Pretty cool I think, and yes, it really does work as advertised. You can't help but feel strange submerging it in a sink full of water for a couple of minutes (up to 30 by Sony's standards), but afterwards, you'll know for sure that you don't have to worry about liquids damaging your investment.BATTERY:Even though it's substantially smaller than the majority of tablet batteries, the Z DOES last as long as Sony claims, and even exceeds my expectations. So far, I've gotten 8 hours of constant use, from surfing to video playback to playing graphic intensive games, and it's down to about 15% remaining. Need I say more?Bottom line? Sony delivered in a big way, and it appears that they've learned from their mistakes in previous, rather anemic tablet offerings. The combination of a great hi rez screen, decent sound, expandable storage, ease of extended use, battery life, raw horsepower... plus features like universal remote control and waterproof... really do make the sum of the whole the best there is, in my opinion.Well done Sony, well done!", "Date": "May 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sony hits a home run....possibly a grand slam", "Author": "Steven Rafalowsky \"Boris WRTC Trinity College...", "ReviewID": "R3NKFWME6G6KZ7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Years ago, the word Sony was the name for the latest in cool products like the walkman.

It's the thinnest and lightest tablet with a 10 inch screen. You can use this tablet in ways that would be impractical with a full-size iPad or Nexus 10. Things like holding it in one hand or reading an ebook for a couple hours. It also looks great.-The screen1920x1080 at 10.1 inches isn't anywhere near the pixel density of the Nexus 10, but it's within striking distance of the retina iPad. You probably won't notice the difference unless you're actively looking for it. Text is sharp. Viewing angles are great. Colors look good. It gets very bright.-The IR blasterIt's actually pretty cool. Grab Sony's TV SideView app and you get an attractive TV guide. Selecting a show and letting the tablet change the channel without touching the remote is a neat trick.THE CONS-Port covers are a pain to open up. This seems to be a side-effect of the water-proof design.THE meh-Speakers are ok but nothing to get excited about.-Snapdragon S4 Pro processor is fast but already a generation behind other Android tablets coming out soon.-Battery life is good but not great.-Sony's default launcher is nicely designed but stutters a little bit even after removing the (useless) default widgets. Installing Nova Launcher is an easy fix if this bothers you.OVERALLUltimately, you're paying a premium price for a tablet with relatively high-end hardware and arguably the best design in its class. Whether or not this is worth it depends entirely on how much you value the design.", "Date": "June 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Suprisingly awesome", "Author": "Infinite Heteroskedasticity", "ReviewID": "RL0ZL6GGZ7VW6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As a long time ipad owner that just picked this up at a local Sony store I'm very pleasantly surprised - so much so that I decided to write up my first Amazon product review ever.The good- Design - In short, its fantastic. Super thin and really light I was so blown away in person I absolutely had to have one. I like the unique squared off look of it and its pretty much the only tablet I've ever seen that makes my ipad look too big and clunky. This is a full performance 10 inch tablet that weighs as little as some 7 inchers.- Engineering - Whatever one thinks about Sony one can't deny their engineering expertise. This is beautifully put together and built. The internals are solid and the screen is gorgeous. Features like NFC and an IR blaster are significantly ahead of those in my 4th gen ipad.- Durability - As everybody knows this tablet is completely waterproof and dust proof. It can even be used in a shower. As somebody with a young child can attest, spills happen and ipad 4 + spilt apple juice = very annoyed parent. Another bonus is that I can just rinse off the tablet under a tap to get rid of smudges/clean it.- Android - This is a matter of taste obviously but to me, a tablet's primary purpose is as an internet consumption device. Just as I would never ditch the apps and stability of iOS on any phone, I prefer to use chrome natively (not the iOS safari skin) for the internet. Sony's android skin is also really light compared to the others (eg Samsung's touch wiz) and offers some useful features - the remote control app that uses the tablets built in IR blaster is proving very useful indeed. It's also a fairly recent Jelly Bean release so it's fairly smooth and responsive throughout.- Gaming - I like to play a few games while traveling and absolutely hate using a touch screen for most of them. This tablet supports my PS3's dualshock controllers natively and I'm fairly certain PS4 support will be ever deeper when it comes out.The bad- Battery life - Its not terrible but that form factor comes with a tradeoff. I get around 8 hours of mixed use from 100% to 10% with stamina on (restricts network when the screen is off - you can customize it to let certain apps through). Similar usage on my ipad 4 gives me around 12 hours.- Charging - The bundled charger is really slow. The tablet takes 8 hours to charge upto 100% from <10%. It's best to let this happen overnight. In contrast my ipad 4 takes 4 hours at most to charge up its bigger battery.- Android - To some this is a negative. Android is really powerful and much smoother than it used to be but the final user experience is not everybody's cup of tea. For me, having chrome was worth the hassle and all the major iOS apps are also there and work well enough but the final selection is much less polished than iOS. There is also no Amazon Instant Video app for android (AFAIK).- Cameras - On paper the camera loadout is impressive with both front and back cameras significantly higher spec than Apple's In practice the lack of a flash might prove an annoyance. I personally don't care because I have never understood the logic of using a tablet to take pictures but for those that do, it can be an issue.The verdictI wanted a tablet that was light but still had a 10 inch screen and chrome. I liked my ipad 4 well enough but eventually realized that I got the entire experience on my iphone 5 (I'll always stick to apple for my phone) but kept it because I disliked the look of every other android tablet on the market. This tablet came along and fit my needs perfectly. The xperia z tablet absolutely destroys every other android tablet out there in terms of design and engineering. I actually find both slightly superior to even the ipad. I can deal with the (mainly) battery related shortcomings. I've always been a bit of a Sony fan since childhood and had been disappointed with their non Playstation products over the past 5 or so years. In many ways, Apple had become the new Sony. This year, between the successful new phones, this and the very cool looking new Playstation 4 I'm sensing that they're back in a big way.", "Date": "June 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Absolutely stunned this is a Sony", "Author": "Abusive Reader", "ReviewID": "RQPD31QXM1RQR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For years,  Sony has been an afterthought compared to apple and Samsung. Apparently Sony finally got sick of this and decided to do something about it. This tablet is the rest.Where do I start? It's about 50% lighter and thinner than an ipad, and is absolutely stunning. I cannot get over how light and thin, and well, sexy this thing is. On top of that, it has top notch internals, beating all current tablets in performance tests. The screen is equally gorgeous. Though the nexus 10 has more pixels, you would not know. Compared side by side, the sonys screen looks better, especially when playing movies.Amazingly well done, Sony. Best android tablet on the market.", "Date": "August 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "The BEST Android tablet you can buy", "Author": "Louis Fischl", "ReviewID": "R8SFWXBBU7VBY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Having come from a Asus Transformer Prime with the wifi and I/O issues, I was ready for a tablet that was really going to meet my needs - great screen, snappy, good battery life, a mircoSD slot, and overall just a pleasure to use.  I wasn't sure if I should wait for some of the new Tegra 4 tablets to come out or possibly go with the Nexus 10, but after I had the opportunity to play with the Tablet Z in a Sony store, I decided that this was the tablet for me.The tablet comes in a smallish box, just big enough for all the items contained within.  Not premium feeling like some cardboard boxes feel, but certianly not junk either.  Inside you find the tablet wrapped in plastic and with a screen cover stuck to the screen as well.  Lifting the tablet out of the box reveals the wall charger, a USB cable, and Sony warranty and product information booklets in several languages - that's it.  Not much inside, but honestly, not much is required outside of the charger and the tablet.The tablet itself feels amazing in hand - the 'svelte' back, the thinness, the weight, etc - it's really nice to hold and to use.  The tablet has a camera on the back and a front facing camera as well, an IR blaster at the top edge, the power button (which also doubles as the notification LED) and the volume rocker on the left side, and then a few port covers around the tablet - on the top left is the port cover for the headphone jack, the bottom left has a port for the USB/MHL port, and the bottom right has the port cover for the microSD and SIM card tray (which is not useable on the WiFi only models).  The port covers are relatively easy to remove, provided you use your fingernail to lift by the latch on the cover, which can take some doing to find at times.  4 speaker grills are placed at the bottom left and right of the tablet, generally where most people would hold the tablet for viewing, thus making your hands into a sound bouncing device for enhanced listening.  The tablet does have a decent sized bezel around it - while some people might find this annoying, I personally enjoy having a larger bezel on my tablet - it allows you to hold the device without your fingers pressing onto the screen - much more comfortable to place your thumb on the front of the device instead of having to push in on the sides to hold it in my opinion.Pressing the power button in for a couple seconds brings the tablet on, and going through the initial setup of the device is relatively easy - inputting your Google account information, etc.  I personally did not sign up/in for the Sony services, as I did not wish to use them at this time.  Once all set up, there was an immediate update to bring the tablet to Android version 4.2.2 (the tablet ships with version 4.1), which was quick to download and install.  Once completed, I began the process of installing my apps and removing some of the bloatware that I was not going to be using on the tablet, which is easy enough to disable/remove via the application manager.  The tablet is nearly 100% stock android in feel, which is great.  Sony does provide some of their own widgets for use which seem nice to use, but I personally did not care for them.Using the tablet is FANTASTIC!  Screen transitions are smooth and fast, and I have not encountered a stutter at all doing anything.  Programs load fast, and everything just feels super snappy - a MUCH better user experience than my old Transformer Prime.  The tablet does ship with the Snapdragon S4 Pro quad-core SOC - while this may be last year's top of the line processor, it certianly is fantastic in its usage on the tablet, and I don't see how the new Snapdragon 600/800 would improve any functionality of the tablet.  Everything loads fast, games run extremely smooth, and videos load and play back without a hitch.  The screen quality is amazing - incredibly detailed, sufficently bright (even too bright at times on the automatic brightness setting), and is vivid and crisp - watching HD video is a joy on this tablet.  The speakers are sufficently loud as well - very clear sounding, slightly lacking in the low-end bass though (which was expected from a small tablet speaker).  I've only used the IR blaster once as a test to try it out, and it worked great, but I don't see myself really using it all that much as I have a Logitech Harmony to do that work.  One thing to note though, is that the tablet does not have a vibrate feature - some tablets do, some don't - just a heads up in case you were expecting it.Wifi works great - locks on fast to the wifi signal, and has a good, long range.  Spots in my home where my Transfomer prime would die out, the Tablet Z is still locked on and holding a good signal.  GPS actually locked on inside my home as well, telling me I would have no issues doing so outside, though I did not buy the tablet for it's GPS capability.  The microSD slot was a little difficult to get my memory card into, but after it was it, it's snug and has no issues - installed a 64 GB Sandisk mircoSD card (SanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card 30MB/s with Adapter SDSDQUA-064G-U46A), tablet recognized it and was working instantly - no issues with it at all.  The USB port is also an MHL 5-pin port - I bought the Cable Matters Micro-USB to HDMI MHL adapter (Cable Matters Micro-USB to HDMI MHL Adapter in Black and Charging Cable in Black 3 Feet) along with the tablet and it works great for allowing me to plug my tablet into an HDMI TV.  Note that this uses the 5-pin MHL adapter, whereas some of the new Samsung Galaxy devices use the new 11-pin adapter - they are not cross compatible.Battery life has been up to expectations as well - I usually get 8-9 hours of screentime with mixed useage between web browsing, video watching, and game playing, most of the time with a couple days inbetween each.  Even with the battery saver option off (which disables syncing and turns off all connections while the tablet is sleeping), the battery life is great, especially for a tablet this thin and light.  I also tested the waterproofing, which works as claimed.  Dunked the tablet into the my bathtub and took it out - works as noted.  Don't know if I am going to keep trying it though, as the thought of waterproof electronics still freaks me out.Overall, this has been the BEST android tablet I have used to date, having used everything from the Transformer Prime to the Nexus 7 and 10.  The speed, fluidness and overall experience on this tablet has just blown me out of the water.  I know I will be enjoying this tablet for the next several years.", "Date": "September 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Tablet!!!", "Author": "Jonathan Charnes", "ReviewID": "R2LNOM8518NN1T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When purchasing a tablet I did not even consider this one at first. It still ran android 4.1 and I mainly just looked at specs when looking at tablets. So, I was looking at the Nexus 10, the iPad 4, iPad air, Samsung note 2014 edition, A variety of Windows tablets, and the Kindle Fire HD and HDX 8.9 . This review will show how I decided against these tablets and for the Xperia Tablet Z.My main top choice was the note 2014. It had the best looking specs and it had the pen which seemed like it would be great for school. However, at the store, the pen seemed a little gimmicky. In addition, the home screen lagged. This one also weighed slightly more (although I didn't really check the weight of this one at the store). I didn't want any lag in a device that costs $500 and the note 2014 didn't seem to warrant the large price tag. Granted a software update may have (and I believe it did) fix the lag, my experience steered me away from the note 2014.The iPad air with ios 7 at the store seemed like a children's toy. It was nice that it was light, however I couldn't get pas the fact that it seemed like a children's toy. In addition, I feel like ios is a very dumbed down OS, so that it feels easy to use for everyone. However, I like exploring features and tinkering with many other things which is pretty much impossible with ios. With ios what you see is what you get. The iPad was great for reading (one of my main reasons purchasing a tablet). However, other than that I saw no great use for it. So for the 500$ that an iPad costs, I decided against it.I decided against an iPad 4 for the same reasons as the iPad air. In addition, the iPad 4 was significantly heavier, and had worse specs.The Kindle Fire HD and HDX were very nice, however they lacked access to the Google play store. This was something I really wanted because I like all of the Google apps such as Hangouts, Chrome, Drive, etc. These apps are NOT available in the amazon app store. In addition, there are MANY other apps that are simply not available for the Kindle fire hd and hdx because they are not able to use the Amazon app store. So while these were beautiful devices, I decided against these as well.Windows tablets seemed very nice. However, Windows RT lacks many apps that I like which is the same issue as the Kindles. In addition, some of the tablets were slightly on the heavy side. But other than that these were pretty much awesome devices. Unfortunately the apps were what made me decide against this. There were some tablets with the full windows 8, which is nice, however I believe that the specs on those were pretty underpowered to run a full windows OS and windows would have taken a significant portion of the available memory.So it was down to the Nexus 10 and the Xperia tablet Z. Unfortunately, the store I was at did not have the Nexus 10 so I was not really able to check this out for myself. However, I knew that support for the Nexus 10 would be coming to an end and the new Nexus 10 was coming closer to being announced. The specs on the Nexus 10 were superior and the price seemed great. So, the only other reason I would not have purchased a Nexus 10 instead would have been the .1 lbs more. The Nexus and the note 2014 do have the most superior screens, however from what I've been reading most content is 1080p or below, so that is negligible.The instant I picked up the Xperia Tablet Z I was amazed. It was EXTREMELY light. It is actually just about .06 lbs more than the iPad air, however this was fine for me because of the bigger screen. Playing around with it seemed fluid with no lag (slight lag now on the home screen if I have a lot of apps open which is normal, otherwise it's great). The lag is removable if I use a different launcher such as Nova, however the Xperia one looks great, so I use that anyways.  In addition, the Sony version of android 4.1 was actually pretty great. It was better than the updated versions due to their changed UI which was optimized for tablets. This one is water proof and has expandable storage (I added a 4gb microsd which is awesome!). It also has a remote function (note 2014 does too). It has an 8gb rear camera and a front camera. In addition it runs every app I want and need. The 224 ppi screen looks pretty good as well and videos look great. Reading on Google Play books and Adobe reader is nice and smooth as well. Magazines look beautiful as well. At first the widescreen format seemed kind of awkward when used in portrait mode, however now that I am used to it it is fantastic for everything I do. The MHL capabilities for TV out and USB OTG to connect peripherals are nice, but I did not test them. I was also able to find this tablet in like new condition on Amazon for $300 (for some reason it was the Japanese version which didn't change a thing) so it sweetened the deal. My only 2 issues which aren't really issues were: 1. the ports start opening by themselves after light use (these need to be closed for the water-proof capabilities) and 2. battery takes a while to charge. However, the battery lasts a long time so that isn't an issue. The port covers opening up is an issue that needs to be fixed, however I don't really use my tablet near any water so it's fine. Although I don't know how it would hold up in my backpack if it was raining outside because of the ports opening. However no other tablet really has this feature and the amazing lightness of this tablet made it the PERFECT choice for me. It did everything I need and it did it great. If you are looking for a perfect tablet, you can end your search here. Trust me! If you have any questions about this or any tablet feel free to ask me :)UPDATE: I forgot to mention a couple other nice things with this tablet. It has multitasking abilities (you can open widgets and resize them and use them and the app that is open. For example I can have a web page or a calculator open while I am watching a video. There is also an FM receiver. I wouldn't put a new rom over this. It is a great OS. I can also download music or videos from computers on my home network using the Walkman app that comes built in.UPDATE 2: Turns out the android 4.3 update came out, however I was not able to get it because I was given a Japanese version from the seller. I was able to have English on my old version and it worked just like it should have, other than this little issue. I assume it would have came eventually, but it's been a while since the US version was released. I did not want to root it or tamper with the original Sony firmware. I am surprised I was able to put a stock US version of the android 4.3 operating system on this rather easily! I just downloaded flashtools, downloaded the firmware file I needed (ftf file), and then I turned off the decice, disconnected, made sure drivers were installed (enable unsigned drivers on windows 8), clicked the lightning symbol clicked flashmode, found my file, clicked ok, and then held the volume down button and connected device and just waited for it to do its thing. It is much easier than it sounds!!! Made my life a million times easier! Now in the future I'll also get the American updates and I'll get them on time. Just make sure you use the correct firmware for your device. I'll update this with any pros/cons regarding the firmware.", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Does it all", "Author": "Paul K", "ReviewID": "R13XTH6XAAI6YM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm extremely happy with this latest Sony tablet.Pros:- very solid build, engineered to perfection.  The lightweight, the balance, the thinness, true Sony craftsmanship- screen colors are rich, the resolution more than adequate at this size. I like the true HD and elongated form factor more than I expected.- Sony Apps: SideView remote way cool -- it's made me enjoy using my television again. Sony Unlimited music doesn't get enough cred. This is really an excellent service with HD streaming, offline playback and playlists, and a virtually unlimited (as the name says) music catalog.  I use this along with Tuned In Pro for my radio.- Waterproof is more useful than I thought. When on vacation, I used in and around the swimming pool. Nice feature.- Battery very fine, longer than I expected due to lightweight form factor.- Speed very fine, no problems for me, snappy.- Music and sound are quite good for a tablet. I pair it up with my Jambox, or else use headphones, so it is more than adequate in my opinion.Cons:- guest mode was removed. maybe this will come back in next OS update. minor, but nice feature for sharing in the family.- screen is a bit smudgy. I may step up for the screen protector.- the cradle is well designed and very useful. downside is the 3' USB cable. It needs a 6' cable to be able to use a floor socket. this was a compromise as the old Sony tablets had real power supplies.Conclusion: I'm extremely happy with this tablet, with the speed and the business apps like Skype, box, and office I can finally use this as a real laptop replacement. The entertainment options rock, and this makes a true fun and business device for me.  I think the price is fair. It's a real laptop equivalent but better in so many ways. The engineering and form factor that Sony puts into the product, I can see the difference.  This is a 3rd generation product and it shows.", "Date": "June 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's hard to find much fault with this Sony Xperia Z tablet", "Author": "southpawami \"The Best Selling Book IS the Bible\"", "ReviewID": "R1LH3ULSOKOT0P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Summary: This Sony Tablet can be productive.  The screen is Full HD which makes books, PowerPoints, and video look excellent.  The built in notes app supports all sorts of media, screenshots, drawing, and various text options.  Microsoft Edge bluetooth keyboard syncs easily. The Sony software is well thought out.  (And if you're a person that forgets the time, the center screen has a large clock in the middle of it.)Note Art and Screenshots: The paintbrush and pencil tools in the drawing part of the built in notes application make darker lines when moving slowly and lighter lines when moving fast.  The paintbrush gets darker as it layers on top itself.  I'm not sure of the extent of layering with all of the built in note art tools.  This tablet isn't pressure sensitive.  Screenshots of your art, games, or any other app are made by pressing and holding the power button until a menu pops up (select the screenshot option; this is 4.2.2 tested).Memory, Office, and Browser: In 4.2 and 4.3, 16GB and greater memory tablets with the Google Android system seem to me to run better with 8GB free on the main memory, which makes the built in file transfer app useful.  This tablet runs Adobe Flash well.  You can search xda forums for the link to Adobe's download page for unsupported flash installs for Android 4.2; I use flash with web browsers Opera Classic and Boat browser.  Opera Classic is the only web browser on Android that I've tested which passes the Acid 2 test.  Some websites work better with web browsers that pass the Acid 2 test.  Boat browser has floating windows that can be selected from a link in a PowerPoint, making it excellent for multitasking while reading PowerPoints.(Yes, I do read a lot of them.)  In my opinion, OfficeSuite PRO is the best Microsoft Office replacement app for Android.  Even still, buy a couple different office suite apps, as not seeing a PowerPoint page because of a transition glitch may drive you nuts.  Most office suite apps available do not handle files in excess of 20mb dependably.Multitasking: Using the apps in the Google Play store named Widgets Anywhere and Boat Browser are the best multitasking options available for Android.  By multitasking, I mean looking at content from two different places at the same time.  An examples of this are when you are reading and you click on an internet link yet want to keep what you're reading in front of you.  Another example is when you're playing a game and you'd like to keep track of the time.  Other examples might include taking notes over something you're reading(I'm not aware of how to do this), or sketching something when inspiration hits while still wanting to keep what you were doing in front of you(I'm not aware of how to do this).Security and USB: The facial lock system depends a lot on the lighting within a room.  You can take more facial pictures in different lighting to increase the likelihood of unlocking the tablet with your face.  The facial lock times out quickly in order to reduce the possibility of hacking, which the tablet warns you about when you select the facial lock option.  After the facial lock times out, inputing a password, pin, or code is the only option.  The USB slot is a common micro style, instead of the more comfortable full size.  The ideal solution appears to be this StarTech product StarTech.com Micro USB OTG to USB Adapter - Micro USB Male OTG to USB Female Adapter - USB On The Go Adapter.  One reason USB is important is because art applications Sketchbook Pro and ArtFlow on Google Play advertise that they support Wacom tablets.Battery and Camera:  The camera is limited to lighting.  It will take a great sharp shot in the right lighting.  My luck is generally not the right lighting, which leans toward a grainy shot.  The forward camera is the same way, so if you're Skyping an interview, check your lighting.  Battery life is excellent.  I went on a vaction for two weeks with the wifi turned off and this tablet still had 8 percent power.  The screen is the main battery drainer.  Any app that uses Unity drains the battery quickly.Durability:  I've dropped mine while in the Moko case three or four times.  One time part of the corner was damaged after the impact with concrete.  I turned it off waited ten seconds, then turned it on.  It works well for me.  The best durability available appears to be the clear thin plastic case slid into the Moko case.Conclusion:  In the end, it's a tablet.  Not a laptop disguised a tablet.  An elite tablet.  This tablet includes Google content options AND Sony content options, which is more than Google content options only.  The 4.3 update removed the hold power button down for screenshot.  Apps of note on the Google store are Docs to Go(good excel display), VideoPad, My Screenplays Pro, Sunvox, Artflow, WaterColorPencil, Infinite Manga, biiCADo, TurboViewer X, Spacedraw, SubDivFormer, Chanu, Overbite Android(gopher), BoatBrowser, NoteLynX Pro, MX Player Pro, OliveTree Bible Study, Bard's Tale, and Level 22.  On the Sony Playstation store, you have apps that work on both the network and PSVita... so, it seems you can sync calendar events with PSVita.  There's note apps and other practical apps that work across PSVita and this tablet.  These apps have come very recently, so now, it is most definitely possible to use a PSVita in a productive sort of manner.  The game Cytus Lambda on the Sony store is a big plus.", "Date": "September 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice hardware implementation, but serious (software) flaws", "Author": "Dan Nasty \"dnastase\"", "ReviewID": "R1XJM45SZEETEE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I did my research before buying and I was happy with the specs, advantages and disadvantages of this tablet.However there are three things that I only discovered after playing with it:1) they didn't upgrade the Android on it.

I mean: what kind of quality control do they have there ?!3) the micro-sd card shows errors when used heavily :( This is an even more of a problem than the Wifi + bluetooth issue. It means you effectively can't use more disc space than the internal 32Gb.So far I didn't on the internet any fixes for these issues.", "Date": "July 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome Android Tablet", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Goode & Eiffel\"", "ReviewID": "RBIVEE2HVIWDW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have never owned an Apple product. However, my wife owns an iPad 4 that her work reimbursed. This is my first Android tablet, but I've played around with many. This is the first Android tablet that has been able to convince me to buy. I also own a Galaxy Nexus smartphone and two 5\" Samsung Galaxy Players (for kids,) as well as the original Kindle Fire that my 3 year old uses.What convinced me to buy?o Thin and lighto Decent battery lifeo Higher resolution screen w/16:10 ratioo Waterproofo IR blastero Elegant designo Sony claim to upgrade Android OSDoes the tablet live up to my expectations?Thin and Light: Extremely impressive! This tablet is so thin and light for a 10\" tablet. After using iPad 4 with protective case, this brings a smile to my face when I pick it up. If thin and light is a top concern for you, this is the one. Even my kids love holding this...so much so that my 8 year old thinks it's hers!Decent Battery Life: The battery life of the Tablet Z varies widely. When frugal to moderate, it can easily achieve the claimed battery life of around 8-10 hours. The way I use it with Wifi on,I typically get around 8 hours use. The screen brightness has the biggest impact. When full bright, it will drain the battery very quickly, 4-6 hours depending on what you are doing. With full bright, the AC charger can't even keep up during use. Your battery will keep draining. Even bringing down brightness to about 80% makes a big difference. Around that point, the battery starts to charge back up when plugged in and using the tablet. At 50%-65% seems to be a good balance between brightness and reaching the upper levels of battery life claim.Higher Resolution Screen: The reason I didn't bite on tablets such as the Note 10 is because of the resolution. It isn't bad, but not great. The Tablet Z is sharp, but compared to my wife's iPad 4, it's noticeably behind. If you don't compare to the iPad 4, it is really very good. The 16:10 ratio offers closer to a 1080P experience once softbars are in play. For this reason, I appreciate the 16:10 (1920x1200) resolution. Like any other large tablet, it is harder to type with both thumbs in landscape mode. However, portrait mode is better for typing. Color saturation is not overdone and yet renders colors well.*UPDATE 14 AUG 2013* I bought a great little app from the Google Play Store called \"Thumb Keyboard\" and it makes typing in landscape much much better by offering a split keyboard. It works perfectly with this extra wide tablet. It even helps typing in portrait mode become a better experience. I love that I can add custom mapped buttons on the top row for items like the comma and apostrophe. I am typing this update from the Xperia Tablet Z. Of course, this app can be used on any tablet or phone.Waterproof: We all like a little novelty. The waterproof claims are good. I have the freedom to use this tablet in places I wouldn't dare with other devices. I've used it in the tub, shower, pool, and even wash it in the sink. What you need to know, though, is that if you completely submerse the tablet, it is not functional due to the fact water does conduct electricity. The screen gets confused and does crazy things as if one were touching it all over the place randomly. The good news is, if watching a movie in the tub and it gets splashed, it can take a fair amount of splashing without acting like it is completely submersed. To keep it waterproof, the power, headphone and SD ports have covers on them. Especially power, can be a bit annoying taking on and off all the time. The flap can get in the way while plugging in the power cord. Even with a tiny \"latch\" to hold the cover when off, it does not hold tightly and gets jarred off easily. I'm used to it and willing to live with this minor inconvenience for the waterproof ability.IR Blaster: If you love TV and want a universal remote, this tablet works well. You can customize the layout, although it isn't always the easiest experience.  Bottom line, it works. I've always been interested in the Logitech Harmony remotes and with this, I no longer care to spend money on those remotes. Considering how expensive some of those are, this could be a nice justification in and of itself. The TV guide-like functionality does require an app download. I've used it and it is neat. It works. I set up my Samsung TVs and Bluray players with little fuss. It just worked.Elegant Design: This is subjective, but I think it is very nice looking compared to Samsung tablets. It's simple and elegant. I don't mind at all showing it off.OS Upgrade: I am currently on Android 4.1.2. It came with 4.1.1. I'm still waiting on 4.2, which is supposed to allow multiple user accounts. As of August 5, 2013, I heard 4.2 is around the corner with 4.3 being pushed out even later. While not here yet, I do appreciate knowing I can eventually get those upgrades.Other Notes:o I wish this had a dedicated button/switch to lock screen rotation like the iPad 4. As is, it takes 2 taps just to get to the menu. Other key settings that people want to change on the fly are also two taps away just to see the options. I'd rather it be only one tap away. Since Sony lightly skinned the Android OS, I'd like to see this change. This includes screen brightness, WiFi on/off, and Airplane Mode.o Camera picture quality is so-so. It's there. It needs very good lighting to take decent pictures. There is no LED light.o Video is the same as camera notes.o Sound quality was highly touted by Sony. In reality, speaker does get good loudness, but quality isn't anything impressive. In fact, when loud, it kind of hurts the ears. Compared to iPad 4, the Sony sound lacks much full body and depth and richness. iPad 4 wins hands down. I also own a couple of very high end headphones from Audez'e and HiFiMan and the sound with those headphones plugged in  is better. It's not as good as my Cowon player, but it's good.o Price/Value: Honestly, I'd say it isn't worth the high price unless you must have thin and light and waterproof features. These are the areas it stands out compared to other 10\" inch tablets and where the others are lacking. I was willing to pay for the thin and light, and am happy with the purchase for that reason alone.Conclusion:Mainly because it could be better in the value department, and because of a few other nitpicky points, I give the Sony Xperia Z Tablet 4 Stars. The Sony and iPad each have their appealing points. The choice comes down to which OS environment you want, and which features mean the most to you.", "Date": "August 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Greate tablet from Sony", "Author": "Tariq Salah Ibrahim", "ReviewID": "R17Y67Z0OJSSY0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a light weight tablet since long time. The tablet I like should be with high quality build from a trusted manufacturer because I struggled too much with my hardware failure of my ASUS. This ASUS got not to switch on even plugged to the charger. I read several reviews about future tablets and I decided to buy this one from Sony.I ordered my tablet from Amazon and surprisingly, I received it after few days. When I opened the package, I was very happy of the lightweight of this very thin device. If you compare it to Note 10.1 or ASUS, you will feel the weight and balance difference easily.I switched on the tablet and now I understand why all reviews of its screen are positive. Really, the colors are vivid and the contrast is perfect. I started to fan some pages here and there and I was astonished with the high quality screen. Then, I copied my 14GB high quality photos to the 64GB SanDisk I purchased with the tablet while checking the reading quality of ezPdf reader, office applications, internet pages, mail, ... etc. and simply tell that it is really excellent. Compared to Note 10.1 and ASUS the text is very sharp and the wide screen with the high resolution makes a full page portrait reading easily in most cases.Second I watched some demo movies comes preinstalled and it was glowing with stunning HD and amazing colors. Again contrast play a rule in the tablet to be very happy watching HD movies.Then I viewed the photos. It is a pleasant to see your albums specially if you have a high grade camera.For my usage of a tablet mostly for reading staff, such battery is ok for me. Others may need a better battery to last longer. I am satisfied with the battery because I understood that bigger battery means heavier and bulkier device. The weight of the tablet is perfect. I wish my future tablet to be even lighter and thinner. I know before I purchase this tablet that there are so many negative reviews about the battery. But 9 to 10 hours is ok for my kind of usages.I highly recommend everyone going to buy this tablet to start with a good screen protector because the worst thing in this tablet is the finger prints. Yesterday, I have installed the AromSuit and I'm waiting until it will be dried to see the result. FYI while I'm installing the screen protector I found a very thin micro scratches on the screen glass. I thing that the glass is not scratch resistant and it would be better to buy the screen protector with the tablet not after one week as I did.One more thing, I bought Bamboo stylus it was the worst experience for me.

I have been looking for the right tablet computer for over a year.  I wanted an Android because my Smartphone is an Android device and I found it interfaced well with Windows (I have had issues in the past with the interface between Windows environment and other OS).  I also wanted something that was fast, with support for either USB or SD memory expansion, with excellent graphics for video and with good sound.  I wanted something that was set up for Wi-Fi and with 2GB RAM.  NOTHING I found on the market matched my requirements-and I looked at all sorts of Tablets.  They either had reliability issues, or build issues, or software issues, or I/O bottlenecks or so on...I could not find anything that met my requirements (which were pretty tough to meet I will admit).  Only two even came CLOSE-and one didn't have expandable memory and the other has known I/o bottlenecking issues.Then I saw the Xperia Z.  Now, I am one of those people who are generally 2 years behind the \"latest\" technology.  It is exceedingly rare for me to buy the \"newest thing\" when it comes out-because I know that 2 years from now it will cost half as much.  So I NEVER buy the \"just released\" items-and haven't for nearly 30 years.Despite that fact, I finally gave in and bought this tablet.  I bought this one based on the \"pre-release\" reviews, the overseas reviews and because the specs matched what I wanted. Nervously, in a panic that I would not like it, afraid I had made a huge error by buying the \"newest thing\"-but I bought it anyway.And I could NOT be happier with it.  It does everything I want-web browsing, e-mail, video playback, GREAT graphics and display capabilities, wonderful sound (both with and without headphones).  The memory expansion works beautifully with SD cards.  It connected to my wireless network without a hitch.  I had NO trouble downloading android apps.  I could go on and on-this tablet is simply a marvel.  I have had laptops that were not this good.Suffice it to say, for someone who NEVER buys the \"latest and greatest\" I am VERY, VERY glad I gave in and did it this time.

I started using the tablet today when I opened the box I was surprised at how light the tablet is.  For being so slim it is very sturdy. I love the fact that it is water resistant this is great as I have nieces who are young.  I had to update 15 apps on the tablet once I opened it and they updated very quickly.  Downloading apps was equally as fast.  The speakers are loud and clear to me  they are pretty good, though I am sure audiophiles will need to connect headphones.  The sound while using headphones, was also very good. I played a few games with no problems the screen was equally responsive and the sound was good.  The screen is very clear and watching videos both on YouTube and the net were beautiful.  I don't have a problem with the tablet not being made out of metal as I think metal would eventually rust. I cant reiterate enough how great this tablet is check it out for yourself at the Sony Store or read reviews online.

Seaton", "ReviewID": "R1DI8FTM0XK6BC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent a good couple of full days pouring over review after review on 10 inch tablets, and eventually narrowed down my choices to the Nexus 10 and the Galaxy Note 10.1.  As a Google fanboy, the direct link to the newest operating systems and best resolution on the market drew me in, while I weighed that against my previous experience with the Samsung Galaxy line of smartphones and the ability to link to a GSM plan.Then I stumbled across a comparison to this tablet, which outperformed both in terms of design.  Okay, to be more accurate, I stumbled across a picture of this tablet functioning while fully submerged in a kitchen sink.  This necessitated a quick stop to the local Fry's to try out a test, as they were understandably sold out of all models.  Less than an hour later I was speeding home at Mach 10 to desperately click \"checkout\" on my account as fast as possible.  A bit dramatic, considering I could've done it with my phone, but don't judge me, I like speeding.Which is clear, after spending about a half hour tinkering with this baby.  It speeds.  Oh, does it speed.  There are a couple other reviewers who can give better technical aspects about it, but the bottom line is, it hauls donkey.  Or at least, it did when I tried using as much memory as I could to give it a rudimentary speed check.DELIVERY UPDATE:When I purchased this, the delivery time was estimated to be 3-5 weeks; July, basically. A day later, it was updated to shipped status.  So don't let the shipping times dissuade you.  From purchase date to \"out for delivery\" took 5 days, including a weekend.Review update:I bumped this down a star to 4.  It's still an absolutely amazing tablet, but I've realized I'm not the biggest fan of the way they implemented the power outlet.  Because of how small the space is with the watertight port cover, I'm unable to completely insert the plug, so it does stick out just a little bit.  I'm sure it's fine, but I'm not a fan of exposed metal when charging a device.Review update 2:  Back to 5.

More than what I was expecting!  I just lost my ASUS Prime (yeah it worked only for 1 year and 6 months) Don't get me started on ASUS.  I'll just focus on this gorgeous tablet.  Not the best of the best, but it certainly can give the best out there a serious run for its money.  Even the best of the best tablets have its flaws and imperfections.  So lets not nitpick on Sony's Tablet Z.  It works great! Sounds good (just tweak it! it is configurable to give better sound), does not have that tinny tiny sound as I read in some reviews.  They didn't tweak the sound settings. I thought they were right until I stumbled upon the sound settings within the pre-installed SONY movie app and the sound did get better.  Not home theater better...geez...its a tablet, ok? :-) But listening was a pleasure after that.  A good pair of headset will of course make it so much better sounding.  But its not a must, unless you are an audiophile and have to have the best sound :-)  Nothing wrong with that, specially if you can afford the best headsets out there. :-) I say, go for it.This tablet simply ROCKS! Snappy, fast, fluid. *crossing my fingers* so far, I have not experienced any stutter even if I was using the pre-installed widgets.  Probably got fixed with the update, I don't know but I didn't experience any stutters.  Zoom in and out is smooth.  Chrome did not give me a problem.  I also have Dolphin.  Works the same to me, so I just choose the browser I feel like on a given day.Love the remote function...have tried it on 2 TVs...one an old LCD Mitsubishi model...paired easy but it loses connection.  The other one is a plasma tv from Panasonic (4 years old), Comcast cable box, audio receiver (8 years old) and it paired well and up to this day, I can still use it as a remote.  I paired it without telling my roommates so it kinda spooked them some when I controlled the tv and cable box without them knowing it was me from several minutes and they thought something is wrong. LOLThe Bravia Engine is fabulous! It just works wonderfully for me! Go to display settings and configure it to your preference...it is more than satisfactory viewing :-)  I love it!Wifi connection is not a problem this time for me.  With the ASUS Prime, I CANNOT watch Netflix,check my email, twitter and FB coz the ASUS wifi reception just can't handle the distance of the router to my bedroom (second floor with lots of walls and doors along the way).  There were some reviews that say Sony Tablet Z can have wifi problems...well I am just so happy I CAN now watch Netflix, browse, check social connections, download in the comfort of my bedroom. FAST! Smooth! No buffering! Wifi indicator swings from 1 to 2 bars when I am in my bedroom, but I have no problems, it does not stutter or buffer.Camera? meh... don't expect too much.  In broad daylight it is good...great pictures. Not a techy person about camera, but I am happy with the way it captures the colors of the flowers in my garden.  Low light...now that is where you just cant win.  Videos? its okay...not gonna be using it much but when I can and its outdoors...its ok.  It can work for me.  If Sony can fix the low light with an update or something, that would be awesome! But camera isn't why I got a tablet, and I don't take pictures or video wit the tablet...occassionaly yes, I do but mostly outdoors.  I feel awkward pointing a tablet at something really ;-p  Its just me.  You can complain about it if you want. :-)Apps? Not as few as some would let you know.  There's a lot.  Just go search.  MOst major apps found in appstore can be found in playstore. I see no difference when I compare with my friend's IPAD. What do I have? I have picture editors: cymera, piccollage, befunky, instagram; News aggregators: Feedly, Appy Geek, Flipboard, Rockmelt, Pocket, news360, NPR News, Drippler; Ebooks app: Overdrive, Kindle, MangaSearcher; Entertainment app: Netflix, Crackle, Animania, Xfinity player, Youtube; Radio app: STitcher, songza, NPR's Wait wait don't tell, NPR Public Radio; Printer app: CamScanner HD, CloudPrint, Canon EPP; email clients; browsers: chrome, dolphin and photon, Google apps: simple games: candy crush, words with friends, subway surfer, sodoku free, royal revolt, chess, backgammon, minion rush, fast racing, pool mania; social app: Plume, Tweetcaster, FB, Skype, Line chat; Utilities: Trust GO antivirus, airdroid, waze, yelp, ziplist. Some widgets running, calendars, weather, clock and a few more... so if you still need more than these...go ahead, search for it and install.  Playstore is not lacking in apps or widgets.I love the fact I can read my ebook and songza or the music player plays something in the background. My roommate who owns an IPAD was so jealous ;-pThe tablet is nice to hold...the lightness and thinness makes reading your ebook a bliss! I read holding it with one hand and my hand don't get tired easy.  I wish I am not so protective of it tho. But I am, so I got a screen protector (it does have a very thin anti-shatter film already) from SONY to just lessen the fingerprint.  It is a fingerprint magnet...just like every tablet out there. It does not feel fragile because its way thin but the lightness just makes me nervous about dropping it ;-p  I just love carrying  it around.  So I bought a case a cheap one until  I find one that truly shows off its thinness but covers it just the same without gouging your pocket. The one Sony sells is pretty expensive...I can buy a cradle and a screen protector with the price. Besides with the cradle (yes I got one), I will need the case only when I bring it outside of the house.Charging time does not take a long time (I guess depends on how long you use it and for what)...try conditioning your battery. I let it drain to as low as 2% twice and fully charge it. Put it on smart mode, and I believe that helped me get my tablet thru the day and often, beyond a day.  I use my tablet at interval times...but it does make me use my laptop less.  I don't sit and use my tablet for 8 hours straight or even 6 hours...(2-3 hours straight is the most i could do and then just come back to it whenever I get a notice for email, FB, twitter feeds, then listen to anything new, read again, watch, I go pretty much back and forth, just not nonstop use) so I pretty much have a lot leftover as the day ends and I can still have lots to spare for bedtime tablet fun.  I usually charge only at night, sometimes, I don't even need to. I like reading the news, listening to the radio apps, check on my emails and social media apps several times within the day.  I do read ebooks and watch some movies as I work on my laptop. I watch more than one movie on Netflix as I work.  With the cradle, charging time is much better, takes a lot less time to do it.  So yeah, get a cradle if you want to. It does help with the charging time.  You sure can use your tablet while its charging.  It wont drain it, and it doesn't stop charging it just coz you are using. I observed it, when I started to charge it when it got down to 10%, and it did charge...not as fast but it does move...very slow, at 1% every 10 minutes (rough estimate). I was watching Netflix, other times I was playing my simple games.Bluetooth works pretty well too! I have the hdmx jam portable speaker and it rocks well with it. :-)  But like I said, I am happy with the sound from the tablet.  And Airdroid app pretty much makes file transfer/deletion a breeze. No Bluetooth, wires or cords needed, its fast. It connects well with my pc too if I needed it to.NO I haven't dunked it in water...but I have tried washing it when the fingerprints gets too much. I wash it while its ON and while its OFF...it works fine after each washing :-) Just make sure all ports are closed!!!I got the 16GB. Yeah pretty small storage, but after installing all that app and putting like 100 music files and 4 movie in MP4 format...I still have 6.6GB left. Pretty small, yes....but all I  have to do is get a microSD card and I wont feel the limited storage :-) I haven't gotten an sd card, I don't feel I need one despite the small storage space left.  NOt worried about it. Im not a file keeper. And I really don't need music files unless I am in an area without internet and cant use Songza or Netflix for entertainment.Overall, I am so so sooooooo glad to have this tablet.  Don't think of it as an IPAD killer.  But it does shine, looks beautiful, feels good to hold and works really great! And yes, it can stand with the best of the best tablets out there now. Sony did finally get it right...not get it perfect (coz there is no such thing).Should you buy one? Its a personal choice. But I will not hesitate to encourage you. Its a great tablet! I love it! When I was shopping around for a replacement tablet for my ASUS Prime that just died on me despite my babying it, I was looking at Nexus 10, Ipad, Galaxy Note 10.1, windows Rt and lastly, Sony Tablet Z. But when I saw the Tablet z in person, and held it and played with it in the store, I was hooked. Its it for me. Not because the others suck or is not better than Sony Tablet Z.

I kind of just can't stop touching it. It's super-thin, very light, and is regally handsome. I'm not willing to test the \"3 feet of water for 30 minutes\" pledge, but it is very nice to take this into the kitchen without sweating bullets over protecting it. The matte plastic on the back is a smudge magnet, but it is an easy thing now to just get it a bit wet and wipe it down.The screen, which is 1080p (plus a bit more for Android's soft buttons) is really a joy to view. No, it's not an IPS or an AMOLED display. But the black levels are terrific, the colors pop, and both video and photography look great. It gets bright enough to compete with natural light.The battery management really impresses me. We have an Acer Iconia A500, which is an early Tegra2 Android tablet. I feel like that thing just leaks energy out into the universe, at least 5-10% per night even with nothing turned on. The Z has \"STAMINA Mode,\" which automatically toggles WiFi and background updates off when the screen is off. When it estimates 9 days of standby time, I believe it. I had it off the charger for a good 8 hours and it was still at 100% battery. Watching Netflix in HD with the screen set to auto-brightness seems to deplete only about 1 or 2% per 30 minutes.The audio gets pretty loud and stays mostly clear. Netflix sounded great.The unit charges via Micro USB. I am not a lover of this connector, as I find it gets loose over time. No problems yet, however. Charging is rather slow, taking more than several hours to top off.The quad-core Qualcomm system-on-a-chip seems beefy enough to handle everything. Tasks that positively chugged on our Acer A500 are now quick and light. Scrolling between pages is a breeze. Games run very fast (I play The Pinball Arcade, which can tax older Tegra systems). About the only thing that seems slow is the page drawing on Chrome, but I hear there are workarounds, not to mention other browsers.WiFi has not been a problem for me at all. We have an Asus Dark Knight router which JUST reaches into our dining room (long condo, many walls). The Z locked onto it and I could stream HD-ish Netflix with only minimal hitches. It does better than our phones, not quite as well as our laptops, in this regard.SOFTWARESony puts its own skin over Android 4.1.2. Before you cringe too much, it's actually useful. You get \"small apps\" that run over whatever else you're doing, and there is a dock along the top for 4 frequently used programs (Kind of like Windows 7 and 8 desktops). There are some included Sony programs for music, photo, and movie viewing, but they are easily dismissed from the front page and you can use Google's own stuff.The included Remote Control program is marvelous. It uses the IR blaster along the top edge to be a universal remote for any and all home theater gear. It works with all brands, and it is easy to program macros to achieve any task )e.g. watch a blu-ray, watch TV, change inputs, whatever) which is a real boon to those who might be annoyed by techie stuff like that.The other thing you absolutely MUST get is Sony's SideView program. It is an interactive TV guide that works in tandem with the remote. It delivers an accurate program listing as well as a Netflix-like visual display of current programs. You can select a program to watch (or flick it towards the screen) and the IR blaster will do the rest for you, changing the channel. Really cool.VALUEI think Sony should be pricing this about a hundred bones cheaper than it is. That would put it more squarely in line with the competition (Google's Nexus 10, made by Samsung). If you pay full price, you know you're getting a top of the line Android tablet with design that will make people ooh and aah. But I really do think Sony is putting themselves in a tough to justify realm with this price.CONCLUSIONAll in all, this device has made me a believer in tablets as consumption devices. It will still never replace a laptop for me (interface, storage, and legacy programs are too important to me). But as an entertainment device, I am impressed. It is a very good universal remote and TV accoutrement. It is a very good media streamer. It plays games really well. It has great battery life and a build quality that is both beautiful and trust-inspiring. If Sony cut the price, they would sell truckloads of these things. As it is, it's the Android tablet that can really give people a feeling of tech lust on a par with an iPad.UPDATEI have raised the rating of this to 5 stars, given the price cut - exactly the amount I advocate above.", "Date": "July 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Incredible Tablet.

I pay attention to tech sites but only had general knowledge of this device.  I have to say I am loving it.  I have the LTE version (SPG351) which I think is also the international version.  I updated to 4.3 via wifi with no problem.Features I like:WATERPROOFI took it into the shower and it proved that it really is water proof.  I tried to use it while water was running on it and it seems to have difficulty registering swipes.  However I'm not sure if this is an issue if the tablet is fully submerged.FLASHTo make it even more versatile, I was able to install Flash.  I use Dolphin browser to ensure that I can view Flash videos and Flash websites.LTEI use Tmobile for my phone so I took my sim card to a Tmobile store and had them cut it down to micro sim card size so that I can put it into my Xperia Tablet Z.  Worked like a charm. I get amazingly fast LTE speeds (when I'm in an LTE area).  I can use Skype to place calls over LTE, however, placing Google voice calls does not work.DISPLAYThe display is bright and crisp.  I'm not sure how the display stacks up to Samsung Galaxy Note tabs or even Ipad Air, but it definitely exceeds the Ipad 3 that I was using.BATTERY LIFEUsing the stamina mode, the battery life is excellent. I can use the tab all day and still have juice left at night before charging it. Stamina mode turns off radios and stuff when the display sleeps.  Quickly turns everything back on when you double tap to wake it up.WIFI/BLUETOOTH/LTE CONNECTIONConnections to these radios all work very quickly.  I've had no connectivity issues with any of them.  I use a bluetooth headset as well as use bluetooth to easily and quickly \"throw\" files to my phone or my laptop.SOFTWARE / UISony's skin is very limited and allows the tab to feel very close to stock Android.  I added Nova Launcher because I do like to have a little bit more of customization.SPEED / PROCESSINGThe Xperia Tablet Z flies when it comes to processing.  It can handle everything I throw at it.CAMERAThe stock camera is vastly improved with the 4.3 update.  I also installed 3 other 3rd party cameras which all have different features that I like to use under different circumstances.  The camera performs satisfactorily but doesn't quite match the cameras on some of the flagship smartphones these days (Galaxy S4, LG G2, HTC One, etc).GPSGPS works flawlessly and connects very quickly.  I was able to use Google Maps to guide me to several destinations.BUILD QUALITYThis device feels nice in my hand and very solid. It is light weight and I never get tired of holding it. The back has a nice smooth rubber back which feels upscale while allowing for a good grip.  Frequently I swap out the sim card to put back into my phone which requires opening and closing the plastic sim card slot cover.  I do the same with the charging port cover frequently as well.  So far the slot covers still close up tightly just as well as they did when I first got the device.  I highly recommend that you do not bend the slot covers backwards so that they will always close tightly.  I'll probably get a charging dock which will render the removal of the charging port slot cover a moot point.Conclusion:I really like this tab and highly recommend it.  I enjoy it 100x's more than the Ipad 3 I had been using. I was able to play with an Ipad Air at the Mac store and though I was impressed with it (light weight and nice display) I couldn't see myself enjoying being stuck with Itunes and inability to customize.I found on xda developers the method for rooting the Xperia Tablet Z LTE version and will be rooting it soon.

I had purchased it on the day Staples was offering $100 off. I kept it for a few months before selling it on eBay. There was nothing wrong with it though, just that I had no real use for it. Back then, the android app ecosystem for tablet apps was still in nascent stage and the novelty of this new tablet wore off quickly after first few weeks.I did not buy my second tablet until 2013. I wanted to be sure that the next tablet I buy should not follow the way of my first tablet. And since my earlier tablet was android, I gave Win8 a shot this time. I bought a refurb Samsung ATIV 500T. It has a 11.6 inch screen (which I loved) and also comes with a stylus. Initially I loved this tablet (like you would any new gadget) for its large screen and stylus and full desktop OS. And honestly speaking... the Win8 edge gestures (swipe from left to open recently used apps, swipe from top to minimize an app, swipe from top and continue swiping till the bottom edge to close an app, swipe from right to access the charms bar) is the coolest thing to happen to any touchscreen device on any OS. But soon I realized that the app situation for Win8 is even worse than what it was for android tablets back in 2011! And technically speaking, Win8 tablets should not even need apps because it does support full-fledged desktop applications. But its not the same... there is a reason we all have 22+ inches monitors hooked to our desktop for! And the apps that are present keep crashing all the time (netflix, fresh paint). So I ended up returning this tablet too!Soon after I bought this Sony Xperia Tablet Z 32GB (White) from Sony's website. Amazon did not have them in stock and Sony was offering 10% discount for some kind of promotion. I love my new tablet. It is very sleek and light in weight. So light that I'm using this to watch netflix in my bed (before falling asleep) - couldn't do that with my ATIV 500T because it was not comfortable to hold in one hand. I was slightly worried about ordering a white one but I can confidently say now that this white tablet does not make me look girly at all (also confirmed by my wife and my 2 year old). This tablet has an IR port and comes with a remote control app, and I was able to pair my Samsung TV and Motorola set top box with this tablet on first attempt. I keep flipping channels when my wife is watching her soaps and she has no idea whats going on. She thinks that our TV might be possessed. I might enjoy this a little while longer. This tablet is also PlayStaion certified meaning I could easily pair my PS3 dualshock controller with this tablet (uses bluetooth) without having to root it first! I look forward to playing FPS games on this tablet now that I don't have to use the touchscreen to aim anymore. Another feature I love is that this tablet wakes up from sleep by a simple double-tap on the screen. I never realized how much I hated fumbling around for the hardware button until this feature came along. Kudos to Sony for inventing/implementing this feature.Bottom line is that this is not a cheap tablet by any means and this tablet does not have the best screen or the best processor or the best GPU but it works very well as a complete package. When held in hands, it feels like a premium well-made product. When using, it feels snappy enough that I do not notice any lags or freezing issues. Overall, this tablet has provided me with a very pleasant experience and I do not feel like putting this tablet down even for a moment.

I wanted to get a lighter/ large screen/ resistant tablet for my parents and also switch myself to an iPad Air in a few months time. So I got the Xperia Tablet Z and decided to play with it for a while before passing it on.Well, the news is that I might keep it. Gorgeous hardware, smooth operation. Very light. All the pros and cons have been nicely highlighted before, my personal take would be:- I also use an Xperia phone and there is a Sony Xperia app for easy data connection via Bluetooth, plus its own widget to control it. No more creating private WiFi network on the phone, setting the data sharing, manually connecting the tablet etc. when out of the WiFi coverage. It literally took me 2 minutes to set everything up once and that's it.- IR blaster and the accompanying app, very handy. I managed to input functions of all of my remotes (7 in total) into the app very quickly (15 minutes, if that much) so I can stove them away. Remote mess be gone.- I like using music apps and in that sense, iPad is leaps and bounds ahead of Android. Especially in the professional domain. But I also use my computer for music creation, so the iPad was more of an additional gadget (I don't perform live). What I would miss most is using the iPad as a remote surface for Apple Logic music software.- I also like drawing/ sketching/ painting and it that sense Android is way behind as well, app-wise. Again, on the flip side, I do design for living and have a 27\" iMac and Wacom tablets (and real pen and paper and markers...).Some time ago I have decided to become less platform-reliant and therefore started using contact, calendar, notes etc. solutions that can work on any platform (either Apple software that can sync via Google, or 3rd party apps). In that sense, the transition from iOS to Android has been quite painless. And there are things I like in Android better, for example the on-screen keyboard: I was never happy with the iOS all-caps rendering, plus on newer Android you can make it smaller and even split it. Also the freedom to arrange the home screen in a flexible manner, little things like that.All in all, very happy at the moment, I still have couple of months to go before the time comes to give it away \u2014 or not. I like Sony as a brand and this tablet embodies it very nicely: great quality and design (nothing earth-shattering, just very, very pleasant to use).", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Solid, Beautiful Android Tablet", "Author": "Poogy", "ReviewID": "RA9D0A04FC396", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Xperia Z is definitely pretty and impressively constructed.  Very thin (less than 7 mm/slightly more than 1/4 in) and light (one pound), it's easy to carry around, and you can hold it with one hand while operating it with the other--unusual for a 10-inch tablet.  It's water and dust resistant, as a result of plastic caps that cover the 3.5mm headphone jack, micro USB port, and microSD card slot around the perimeter.  So you really can use it in the bathtub if you're so inclined, but more realistically, you don't have to worry about spills or rain or humidity.  (Those little caps seem flimsy, though, and I suspect that eventually one or more may break, destroying the water resistant feature.)  Although it's plastic, it looks great and other than the plastic caps on the ports, feels very solid. Completely flat, with slightly rounded corners.I find that the gorgeous glass screen gets covered with fingerprints very easily.It has a microSD slot so you can add plenty of extra storage(up to 64 GB)on top of the 16 GB it comes with.The 10.1-inch 1920x1200 LED-backlit HD LCD \"Bravia Reality Display\" doesn't have the resolution of, say, the Nexus 10 (300 ppi vs. 224 ppi), but it looks clear and crisp, with good black levels.It comes with an 8MP back-facing camera and a 2MP front-facing camera.  I expect little from a 2MP camera, and this one's about average.  The 8MP camera is adequate, but particularly in low light, subpar.It carries a 6000mAh battery (as opposed to, say, the Nexus 10's 9000mAh).  I get a couple of days of use on a full charge, with about six hours of screen use tops. This is a few hours less than a number of other tablets that don't have to sacrifice battery capacity for thinness and light weight. It has a Stamina Mode that disables data when the screen is off, allowing very long standby time if you can live without updates and notifications during that time.  There's a battery menu with a standby timer that's pretty accurate.  Charging the battery through the miniUSB port is quite slow.The two speakers produce better than average volume for a tablet, but don't expect great sound from such tiny speakers.I'm not crazy about the keyboard the Xperia comes with.  The autocorrect isn't very accurate, and neither is the swype input.  But there are other keyboards out there you can download.This is a Wi-Fi only tablet that connects to 802.11b/g/n networks on both 2.4 and 5GHz frequencies. Bluetooth 4.0 and NFC are also on board.  All work well.The Xperia Tablet Z is powered by a quad-core 1.5GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Pro processor with 2GB RAM, and it's faster than most.  It handles graphics-intensive games well, and web browsing is speedy.In summary, the Xperia Z is attractive, speedy, and light.  The main cons are mediocre camera and battery life.  Value for the price is very subjective, and it's debatable whether this tablet is worth the premium price. Other tablets can perform most of the same functions for a lower cost.

I have checked the waterproof ability and it seems to be pretty impressive. After staying 10 minutes under water(dare not to risk it for 30 min..), everything still works perfectlyOne reason I chose this Android tablet over iPad is its design. Having been a fan of SONY product for years, I always love how delicate and beautiful the SONY-style is, and this design style is undoubtedly adopted by Tablet Z. Call me superficial if you want, but the design of a product, AKA its aesthetic value, is really a big deal to me. Surely, I am not saying that iPad is ugly by any means; it is just a personal preference.This tablet runs on Android 4.1.2 and the user experience is overall satisfactory. Not as smooth as iOS, but it does nor lag very often. Its S4 Pro processor is relatively powerful but I will be happier if it is Snapdragon 800.The not so good:Speakers. Yes, I know how SONY brags about its speaker performance in the ads, but it turned out to be a little disappointing. The sound is totally not loud enough and its quality is not comparable to Note 10.1.Screen is okay but PPI needs to be higher. The display offered by tablet Z is not bad, but the relatively low PPI sometimes can make the pictures seem to be pixelated.

I did quite a bit of research and comparing between other top tablets before purchasing. I kept coming back to the Xperia, even though I had never actually seen it in person. I ended up ordering it off Amazon without ever seeing it, that was how smitten I was with it! The design of the tablet was so striking and elegant to me. I love the thinness and the squared off corners. To me it makes it look like less of a kid's leapfrog pad and more like the sophisticated internet machine that it is. The screen is crisp and leaves nothing to be desired. Response to the touch screen is extremely fast and I have not seen any lag. The operating system is easy to learn (this was my first android product) and it works marvelously. The battery life for me, with normal internet surfing, social media, Netflix, and book reading through Google play is about 3 days. I've seen in reviews it takes awhile to charge, but I just plug it in over an 8 hour shift or overnight, so I have no complaints. I do use the tablet all the way down to about zero battery before charging it. I've heard that charging batteries like that in general helps prolong the battery life, so I'll keep doing it. The speakers on the side are an interesting choice, but depending on how you hold it if your hands cup them it amplifies the sound. Laying it flat on a counter or in an empty bathroom sink also amplifies it. The sound is good considering how tiny the speakers really are. I have not tested the waterproof feature like some people, but it is comforting knowing that I don't have to worry if I take it in the bathroom to play tunes while showering or if I drink tea while using it or bring it into the kitchen while cooking. Not having to baby it or worry about it is really nice. I would highly recommend this tablet to anyone and everyone! I honestly would never buy a different tablet. Sony's eye for simplistic, quality, and sophisticated design makes the tablet itself a beautiful gadget, and the Android operating system makes it powerful and intuitive to use.

Johnson", "ReviewID": "R3KRN5G46J0U0Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been eying tablet PC's for many years, however I never pulled the trigger because it seemed my only choice was an Apple IPad and I do not like apple products, nor did I like the way Apple arrogantly refuses to offer external storage on their products. Once Samsung started to make a name for itself in the tablet market I found myself drawn to the Galaxy Tablet, but for some reason I did not want to pull the trigger when I saw it in the store a couple of weeks ago.  Instead of rushing a Galaxy Tab 3 purchase, I decided to go home and do more research.My research introduced me to the Sony Xperia Z Tablet.  Specs wise, the Sony is superior to the Galaxy Tab 3 in processing power (Quad core vs Dual Core), screen resolution as well as a higher rated camera.  Another plus is that this tablet is water proof and can be fully submerged into water and it won't ruin the tablet.  (requires all ports be closed).For me the choice was clear even though the Xperia was considerably more in cost than the Galaxy.  After more research and spending nearly an hour comparing the two side by side in the store.  I decided to purchase the Xperia.For the most part this tablet does not disappoint but there are some things I wish were there.The good.Look/Feel:Originally I did not like the way the tablet felt in my hands when using it in the store.  It felt generic and honestly I like the feel of the galaxy tablet better.  However after getting it home and playing with it all night, I really do like the sleekness and the feel.  It's light, but it feels professional and sturdy.Processing Power:As with my Galaxy S, when using the Galaxy Tab 3 in the store, I would notice that applications would occasionally stutter or freeze.  However with the Xperia I did not run into this problem when using it in the store and only once or twice since using it for about three weeks now.  Applications are extremely responsive and screens touches are immediately recognized with no delay.Screen:The screen is beautiful and puts out vibrant colors, when comparing the same videos between this and the Galaxy Tab, the Xperia just looked better. The Galaxy's screen colors looked washed out when comparing the two tablets side by side.Water Proof:While I have no plans on using this around water, I just think the fact that this tablet is completely water and dust proof is just cool.  I saw the demonstrations online where the person would completely submerge the tablet in water while it was powered on.  Finally I got up the nerve to try this demonstration myself and luckily it did not ruin the tablet.  I have attached a picture showing my Xperia tablet functioning while it was completely submerged.Battery Life:Surprisingly, the battery life on this tablet is very good.  My Galaxy S phone will be completely dead after only a few hours even when not using it.  However this tablet does a very good job in managing its battery life.  I used this tablet continuously for about 8 hours and the battery life went down to 40% before I decided to charge it again.Things I don't likeSony Xperia Link Software:While I purposely got the wi-fi version of the tablet because I did not want to pay my wireless provider a monthly fee for a data plan, I noticed that there was a pre-installed application that would allow me to link the tablet to my cell phone's network to use when Wi-Fi isn't available.  However I quickly found out that it requires an Xperia Phone and will not work with other manufacturers phones.  This wouldn't be so bad because I need another phone anyway, but my wireless provider does not sell Xperia phones, so I have to buy one from a third party or Ebay which is not always 100% reliable.No way to play music from other devices via BluetoothI have tried but I could not figure out a way to play music from my laptop on my tablet via bluetooth audio.  I'm able to do it the other way around but that is it.  This isn't a big drawback, but it would be nice if I could do it.  To get around this I just copied all my music on a microSD card and popped it in the tablet.No support for Amazon Instant Video (update 1/2/2013: see comments section for workaround)This isn't really the fault of the Xperia tablet, but it's worth mentioning that if you expect to be able to watch Amazon Instant Videos on the beautiul screen, then you will be disappointed.  According to Amazon, there is no support for Amazon Instant video on any android device \"at this time\".  Apparently Amazon only caters to Apple devices as well as their own kindle.  This is an annoyance and it would have been nice to be able to watch Amazon instant movies on my tablet instead of having to watch them through my XBOX or PS3.  This was one of the major things that stopped me from purchasing this tablet sooner, but I figured that even with this drawback, I still prefer the Xperia Tablet over the iPad, and the Kindle.UPDATE:  With help I was able to get Amazon Instant video to play on my device.  As you can see in the comment section, it requires the Dolphin browser, the JetPack plugin, and the last available version of flash for android.  Adobe no longer supports flash for Android, but you can still download their last android version of flash from their website by googling \"Flash archived versions\" and scrolling down to the android section.  You also have to make sure you have flash enabled in your Dolphin browser settings, and make sure Agent is set to desktop.  Once you have everything set up properly you can watch Amazon Instant video via the Dolphin browser just as you would on a regular PC.  In addition to Amazon Instant video you can also watch videos from other sites as well (such as Full Episodes on Fox).No flash for cameraAfter I got it home and took some sample pictures, I was surprised to notice that there was no flash.  I kind of assumed it would have a flash and was disappointed when I didn't find one.  However I then realized that the Galaxy Tab 3 doesn't have a flash either so nothing was really lose here.  However at this price I would expect the camera to have a flash.Wi-fi connection sometimes drops for no reasonI have noticed that when connected to wi-fi, the tablet will sometimes without warning disconnect itself from the network.  I have not figured out what I can do to prevent this and have no clue on when its about to happen.  Some days it keeps the connection all day, but one other days I would get 4 or 5 automatic disconnections.  This is very annoying but luckily it doesn't happen often enough for it to be a major problem (yet).Despite the issues I have with this tablet, I think its the best choice for me and with this tablet currently being sold for 20% off its original price its a great deal and a great alternative to the iPad.", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "great", "Author": "Juan S\u00e1nchez", "ReviewID": "RDX7UEMTIJNEC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great choice the best of Sony works excelent if you have already a Sony Xperia smartphone or any Sony device", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for almost everything...", "Author": "Vlad Pitt \"technocrazy\"", "ReviewID": "R1KXULF133VDXL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I thought it will be a toy for me.. but now I am actually using it sometimes for work related stuff...

I've been in the market for a higher end large screen tablet for the last year but haven't been able to find anything affordable and impressive enough to replace my rooted HP TouchPad Wi-Fi 32 GB 9.7-Inch Tablet Computer (which I mainly use for home browsing and games) and Kindle Fire 7\", LCD Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offers (which I carry with me primarily as an e-reader on my work commute).  I considered purchasing in the NOOK HD+ 9\" 32GB Tablet after the opening of the Android market and the significant price drop.  Then the Sony Xperia Z SGP311U1/B 10.1-Inch 16GB Tablet came along and made that decision much easier.  Here are my thoughts;Pros+ Gorgeous 10.1\" display with an LCD resolution of 1920 x 1200.+ Extremely thin (.27 inches) and lightweight design (17.44 ounces).  The Sony Xperia Z is currently the thinnest and lightest 10.1\" tablet on the market.+ Lightning fast quadcore 1.5 GHz Snapdragon S4 Pro processor.+ Micro SD card slot (Exandable up to 64GB).+ Dual cameras with the rear being an 8 megapixels and the front at 2 megapixels.+ IR Blaster/TV SideView app can be used as a universal remote control.  I found this ability very useful as I'm always carrying my tablet around the house with me.+ Water resistant and immersible in a meter of water for 30 minutes (although I'm not personally brave enough to test it).  Read in the tub without worry if that's your thing!+ Playstation Certified allowing me access to the Playstation Suite.  This is perfect for me as I've been a loyal Playstation owner since the system's original launch in 1994.+ Respectable external speakers, however the sound is fantastic when wearing headphones.+ Decent battery life (approximately 7-8 hours for me), even when using heavier applications.+ 720p video recording complete with video editing features.+ Runs on Android 4.1 Jellybean and is upgradable to 4.2 Jellybean.+ Full tablet start up in mere seconds.Cons- Unable to charge directly via the USB cable into a PC port.  Tablet must be plugged into the AC adapter (included) which plugs into a standard electrical socket.  Charging time also seems a bit longer than my other devices.- Ports can be troublesome to find as they're extremely well disguised and difficult to open if you have large hands and short fingernails.  Unfortunately, these snug seals are necessary for waterproofing the tablet.- Like most tablets on the market, the external speakers are good, but it's still a portable device so don't expect home theater sound.- High price point, however considering what you're getting it's difficult to argue.- Pressing the volume control button can be a little problematic at times depending on the angle.- USB charge cable is quite short at only 3'.  Since you have to charge the device using the AC adapter it's bothersome since I'm always more than 3' from an outlet.- Screen is prone to excessive fingerprint smudging.  If that bothers you you'll either have to clean it often or get a screen protector.The Sony Xperia Z SGP311U1/B 10.1-Inch 16GB Tablet is without a doubt one of the most impressive 10.1\" tablets on the market today.  It boasts so many impressive features it's  easy to overlook it's few minor flaws.  Before I even received this tablet I began researching and purchasing products to better accessorize the gadget which would soon be glued to my hand.  I picked up the Poetic Slimline Case for Sony Xperia Z Tablet 10.1 Black (3 Year Manufacturer Warranty From Poetic), Sony IT Charging Cradle for Xperia Tablet Z (SGPDS5) and Fosmon Crystal Clear Screen Protector Shield for Sony Xperia Tablet Z - 1 Pack.  As other reviewers have stated, this tablet is not an iPad killer, however if you enjoy the freedom of the Android operating system you'd be hard pressed to do better than the Sony Xperia Z SGP311U1/B 10.1-Inch 16GB Tablet.

The overall look and feel was impressive. It was as light as expected. In short, it was exactly as described. The more I worked with it, the more I liked it. The Water Resistant feature was a big, big, big, big plus for me.The deal killer for me was in the Android operating system, which I knew would be a risk when I ordered it. A major use for the tablet is viewing Amazon Instant Videos. Yes, I knew that this Sony tablet was not a Instant Video Compatible Device, and Flash Player is no longer supported by Adobe for Android operating systems... and there is no Android version of Silverlight... but so many websites claimed to have a \"work around\" - just download a different browser app, or use a hacked version of Flash Player...Well, after getting the tablet and running through all the different websites \"fixes,\" my conclusion is that there is no acceptable fix at this time.I don't blame Amazon, my Instant Videos play well on my Win 7 laptop (as well as iPads and other compatible devices). Why should Amazon bend over to accommodate a major competitor. I also don't blame Sony, I have a Sony Vaio laptop and I am just as happy with it.But I'm done trying to fit a square peg in a round hole - I'm getting a Kindle Fire HDX. If you're a cynic, you are thinking that I'm falling right into Amazon's marketing plan. I disagree for several reasons including the one discussed above.

I thought the battery was not in it when I first unpacked it as shown in the video. From there the base functionality is just like any Android device with some added benefits.  The screen quality was excellent, even dimming it some to conserve battery life.Battery life: I easily got eight hours of usage out of the device including browsing, streaming, playing with apps and connecting to everything I could find in the house via IR or on the network.  I did dim it to about 65% as I find no need for the brightest setting.  In saying that this is like any other tablet that in direct sunlight you will not see it perfect.  Think eInk technology of the Kindle for that.  It takes a normal amount of time compared ot other tablets to recharge and can use any micro USB charger which is an added benefit. No special adapters needed.Tablet size and weight: I was shocked at how light it is. Really, It still amazes me and anyone that picks it up. I did a direct comparison to the iPad for you in the video so you get an idea of overall length and width. It is both slightly wider and longer.  The downside is that every bag I have is made for iPad or smaller and the length of the Xperia was not on their game plan.  It is easy to hold yet when typing in landscape the keys are spread out quite a bit.Hardware specs: As supplied on this page above, the specs are terrific with the Snapdragon processor and available memory that is built in.  The ability to add a micro Sd card to the device for expansion shuts down any thought of the iOS devices.  I had no issues with any of the buttons, tabs for the port openings or connections.Waterproof (really?) : yes it is.  I dunked it. Quickly, but definitely under water for a short time.  I sat panicked and astounded at the same time.  It worked, was totally dry and sealed tight.  If you use the tablet around the sink when cooking this is perfect!Connectivity: I easily connected it to my wifi and home network. I connect it at Panera's, work, library.  Everywhere.  At home it sees my Windows media shares and can easily stream movies and music.  Simple and effective streaming.  It even has a FM radio? Really? The IR controls worked well if you point right at the device.  I have my TVs and a stereo working great from it.Android: This runs on Jelly Bean so expect updates and more features to come along.  Also with the open Google Play store apps can be found for just about anything.  I used Skype to make calls, our corporate instant messaging app to communicate and more.Sound: The built in speakers are decent.  Nothing exciting.  they don't distort and didn't sound like tin or anything.  They are just ok.Downsides:- Sony provides it's own app store and the Google Play store is on the device.  They do not see each other so if I instal an application from Google Play and look at the same app in the Sony store it shows not installed.  I skipped the Sony one and deleted it.- The remote control function is cool but I wish it let me just pick a TV make and model instead of making my look at 72 different remote layouts for a Samsung (for example) and pick the best one.  The IR works great but that was a pain and time consuming to set up for multiple devices.Overall this is a killer device from Sony and should be looked at as a viable choice for anyone with tons of added benefits over others.  Expansion, waterproof, battery life and more.See the video for setup and my other opinions!", "Date": "July 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "And now, my Fire goes to the shelf", "Author": "Doug Hibbard", "ReviewID": "R17D0EVWOBDGAK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Two years ago, I thought I did not need a tablet. Then, I jumped on the Fire bandwagon and gave it a shot. I thought that was awesome, and have used that tablet constantly.I thought, though, that I could not imagine finding a use for a 10-inch tablet. After all, I have a laptop...Now that I have fired up the Sony Xperia Z, I'm thinking the Fire is headed for the \"here, kids, have a toy\" pile.Why?1. Battery life. When in use for email, Evernote, web-browsing, and Nozbe (to-do organizer), I have used my Xperia for 8 hours. Throw in some music in the background, and it still lasted 8 hours. Admittedly, this is just for music and note-taking, reading, and typing. Still, the ability to use a tablet all day and not have to carry the laptop around for \"while waiting\" tasks? Excellent.2. Screen size. Obviously, you can read the description and do the math, but the difference is amazing compared to how cramped a 7-inch is.3. Thickness. Lack thereof, really. That quarter-inch makes the Xperia easy to hold all day long.4. Small-apps setup. I don't know if another device offers this, but the Xperia has both regular apps and \"small apps.\" The small-apps allow a small notepad, timer, calculator, and a few others, right on top of another running application. Since I frequently use my tablet for presentation notes, the ability to add a timer on top is wonderful--I had been using a KFire and either smartphone or additional tablet. Now, it's all right there.5. Water-resistance. What can I say? A bit of dampness, like a kitchen with steam and splash don't hurt the Xperia. I will not risk mine in full-immersion, but I am not afraid to get it a shade splashed.6.Wi-fi range: I can extend about 50 feet farther from my wifi than I could previously. I'll put that on the receiver of the Xperia.7. Cameras: both are good--although the lighting is not perfect. I'm a lousy photographer anyway, so I'm in no place to give you a good feedback.8. Speed: A few other reviews give you specifics on stats. I'll say this: it pulls apps up quickly. There is a minimal hesitation, but I used to have a Commodore 64 and remember typing load before supper so I could play a game afterwards. A few extra seconds wouldn't bother me. But I don't feel like I'm waiting and waiting.9. Sound quality: I'm a bit on the flat-eared side, so I won't say it's concert quality, but it's better than I expected given the size.10. Memory card. That's good--can save pics or other non-cloud synced items and get them back if the tablet goes splat.Now, drawbacks:A. The water-resistance needs the covering flaps on the ports closed. The covers, though, feel flimsy in their attachment. Additionally, it does not appear that they can be replaced if they are torn off or lost. So, that feature can bite the dust if you're not careful.B. Price: it's within the expectations for this type of device, but still, none of them are cheap.C. TV-Remote: I don't think I really need this, and it's more sensitive to having to be pointed exactly right than my universal remote. So, it's a space-user that cannot be removed. You might like it, I don't need it.D. Sony Apps/music/movies: more just a gripe than a real drawback: I've got Amazon apps, Amazon music, Amazon movies. I've got iStuff apps, music, and movies...and while the music will work, the movies don't. Some of the apps do--except the \"Fire Versions\" that I have. Just one more thing to adjust to.I will say this: I've not gotten my hands on the newest iPad or Samsung, but for a straight-up, does this Tablet deliver what Sony says it will question, I find the Xperia to work as well, or better, than expected based on the specifications.", "Date": "June 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice Tablet", "Author": "Sam1973", "ReviewID": "R3RU5X45RDS6KU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Since I couldn't wait for shipping I bought this 32 GB tablet from Fry's electronics.

When it works properly, it really is quite special. However, it working properly is not at all a sure thing, and that unreliability makes using it in a professional context, as I had hoped to do, completely impossible. I'm a musician, and had planned to use this table both on stage and with students. The unit freezes and goes into an endless restart sequence that can take hours to resolve. I have to hard reset the unit many, many times before it randomly starts up properly. Along the way it will freeze at various points of the startup process, or will make it all the way to being fully booted up, only to freeze and/or crash and reboot itself.Eventually, I will get it to boot into a stable state. It is then a pretty cool tablet, but I dare not count on it for anything other than light entertainment before bed, as it has proven to be completely unreliable.It seems like things I've found that are possible triggers for the wonky behavior are SD cards and widgets, but I have reset the device to factory state several times and the problems continue, even with no third party apps installed.It has been this way since I first received it, and I probably should have returned it right away. However, I can usually eventually (sometimes after hours of resets) get it working properly, and it's easy to convince yourself that it is \"finally\" going to work as advertised. The trap of the optimist.I hate this tablet like I have rarely hated an inanimate object.

The build material is the best on the market. Thin, light and solid. Water proof is a plus. At first, it seemed to perform flawlessly. My first reaction was it will be a keeper. Even at the high price.However, after using it for some time, some deal breaking flaws starting to show themselves.First, the tablet seems to have a wifi issue. The included android email program could not stay connected to servers. Anytime I attempted to read an email, I would get the can't connect to server messge. Sometimes I could manage reading 1 email. Then when I click on the next one, I would get the message. If I closed the program and tried again, sometimes I could read the next message. Not being able to read emails is a huge problem.Next, this tablet had a battery issue. In reading all the reviews, both here on Amazon, and on the internet, I could not find any bad reviews about the battery.  So this leaves me to belive it was just  my unit. With just the wifi on, (bluetooth and GPS turned off) surfing or watching a video or playing a 'not so intensive' game, the battery would last maybe 4 hours. And even with the charger plugged in, the battery level still dropped while using it.Then for the last problem, while using the tablet with the charger plugged in, the screen would randomly start acting irractic. When touching the screen, it would flash or apps would suddenly start opening like someone was touching these apps all at the same time. Unplugging the charger would stop this behavior.I guess I could have lived with the odd behavior of the screen and bad battery life if the price of the unit was not so high. But the constant email issue was a definate deal breaker. So I reluctantly decided to return it.Had none of these issues been present, I would gladly had given this 5 stars. Any other tablet would get 1 star based on these issues.

This tablet is as good a performer is any tablet in the market hands down. I don't have problems with it freezing up while playing games or watching videos. It works awesome with my Bluetooth keyboard, which I purchased separately for $12 and I am able to type long documents in the purchased version of Office. So, my productivity is exactly what I wanted and what I expected.The problem with this tablet is that it consumes so much power that the OEM charger cannot keep up with it. This is a design flaw that Sony is very aware of (see their support forums), unfortunately, nobody is addressing it.  Honestly, they tend to make it the user's fault or incompetence. I have found that purchasing a high-end 2 amp charger helps a great deal, but not always. This thing is a power hog. Additionally, Sony says that it takes 5 hours from complete discharge to full charge. It has been my experience to be as much a 7 or 8 using the OEM charger, especially if left on standby. It does charge a little faster with the power off.I strongly recommend to anyone purchasing this tablet, to buy several OEM cords, because the micro USB connectors do not hold up very well and seem to fail quite often. I have had this unit for 4 months and I have gone through 4 USB cables. I don't move this around and I typically lay it on my desk or on my nightstand at home so it is not like it is going through abuse with the court attached. I will say that I have dropped this unit a couple occasions and it has been very durable without scratches, nick's or cuts to the screen. While never dropped \"hard,\" it still scared me, but it worked just fine without any problems so I think I can say it is a very durable unit as well.With all that being said, I would love to give this tablet 5 stars because it deserves it BUT, the charging issues and power drainage leave me not trusting it away from a wall socket for very long. For instance, on a daylong trip in a couple of airplanes, you are going to have 3 to 4 hours of use. 2 to 3 hours, if you are watching videos. When you get off the plane, you have to find a power outlet, and if the power has drained significantly, if you want to use it on your next 2 hour flight, you better power it down and leave it plugged in for a 4-5 hr layover, otherwise, you're flat out of luck.  Plugging it into a dc outlet will definitely not keep it charged either.

I will note that the battery life is nothing amazing AND charging time is pretty slow.  I've allowed it to charge overnight and wake to discover it is still hasn't reached 100%.  Battery life will vary depending on the app that you're using; if it kills you phone then expect it to kill the tablet.Other than that it's a sweet tablet with solid performance.  It has a nice feature where different users can be allocated, so you each have your own dedicated \"desktop\".  This allows each user to have their own wallpaper and apps, BUT some system settings carry through to each user; not a very big deal.  The only hindrance is that subsequent users cannot access external memory cards, and there is no way to give administrative rights to anyone else except the owner; that's pretty dumb.As a writer I will say that extended typing on the keyboard can be annoying, since the navigation bar runs along the bottom of the screen; your palm will rest along the bottom and activate the back, home, or menu buttons.  I've emailed Sony and made the suggestion to change the OS layout to correct the issue.  Like I said, it is only an annoyance, I rarely write extended pieces on the touch keyboard, BUT it is very fluid and I can type quite efficiently with it.  If it were not for the OS layout, then I may use it more frequently to write.The waterproof covers can be a pain in the ass to open every time you want to charge it or plug in headphones, so I would opt to purchase the charging cradle.  I don't have it yet, but am looking into it as a future buy.  I think it would mitigate the poor battery life, plus the tablet has an optional slideshow function that is activated during charging; could act nicely as a digital photo frame on an end table.", "Date": "December 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Biggest asset is it's lightness of being.", "Author": "Bic", "ReviewID": "R6FI28DH1J3DW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very good tablet.  Not fantastic build quality (as compared to the outstanding Asus tablets), but they had to cut corners to make it light (ie all plastic).  Similar to a Kindle or the Nexus with plastic rather than metal.Biggest advantage is it is light.  Biggest negative is the USB charging is S L O W and fighting the waterproof cover is a bit of a hassle (and gets in the way of some usb plugs).  I ended up buying the charging stand and that takes the hassle out of charging.Overall, a very good tablet (I've had 6 others, so have lots of comparisons with Apple/Samsung/Acer/Motorola and class leading Asus tablets).  I bought (and returned) the new Asus tablet as it seemed like a brick (all of ~3 oz heavier).  But the Asus was gorgeous build and stunning screen, with a much larger battery - and of course was designed to accept their optional keyboard - all of which made the tablet heavier (but much more useful for those who need it).  By contrast, the Xperia is stripped down - lacks the bells and whistles and class leading screen/design/battery life in exchange for being light.I'd place the Xperia a step below the Asus, but I found the power/beauty of the Asus simply lost out to the lightness of the Xperia (I am a power user of my tablets - probably in my hands 12 hours a day, so lightness becomes a top consideration).", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not a \"Main\" Tablet brand but a hidden gem instead.", "Author": "Cody", "ReviewID": "RH0VAN9WTRRY7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this tablet trusting the Sony name as easy to use and reliable products.

BEATS the Apple ... with one small nitpicky issue.  Everyone so far has done a great job with the obvious things such as being used IN water, sealed tight so dirt and sand does not get in etc.  Therefore I will say the flaw is the charging port.  Remember it is the strength of the sealed ports that make it superiour to others (as well as the amazing image and colours)... BUT to charge with the USB cord it is a chore and weakens the water tight feature.  This is not a deal breaker for me... just annoying so I bought the docking stand that charges with metal contact points.  The stand also is great if you want to use a keyboard or not hold the tablet while watching something.  I used to be an Apple fan, but lately the other brands have caught up and passed them in many ways.  Sony has also added a few things you cannot get on other tablets... such as their Walkman app which is an excellent music player.  Lastly I love the remote function.

I have previously shied away from 10\" tablets because of price and weight.Our family owns a Kindle Fire HD 7\" and Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7\".  Previously, we were attracted to 7\" models because of the lower price point, weight, and ease of use (I have small hands).  Both tablets are great in their own right; they each have their unique strengths with the Samsung being used for all-purpose application while I use my Kindle Fire HD primarily because of the Prime Instant Video usage as well as my books and ability to listen to my 16,000 song selection via the cloud.That said, I was a little apprehensive about the 10.1\" Sony Xperia Z.  I was concerned about the size and relative ease of use and the weight was a concern as well.  My wrists aren't what they used to be and my wife has permanent neurological damage to her wrists and arms sustained during a car accident.ERGONOMICS/WEIGHTOut of the box, I was both amazed by how THIN this tablet was (thinner than a pencil!) and by how light it was.  At merely over 1 lb, this tablet weighs only 2 OUNCES more than my 7\" Kindle Fire HD.  The very thin profile of this tablet also makes it amazingly easy to hold and grip.  I did wind up purchasing a case for it MoKo Slim Cover Case for Sony Xperia Tablet Z 10.1 inch, Black (with Flip Stand, Integrated Elastic Hand Strap, and Stylus Loop)-Lifetime Warranty, and even the additional bulk of this case made it easy to hold and the wrist strap on this case completed abated my ergonomic concerns.  Top marks.STARTUPThis thing kicks on in a hurry.  I didn't even get to 7 seconds before this thing was fully booted up and ready to go.  The quad-core processor probably has a lot to do with this.OPERATION/PERFORMANCEThe quad core 1.5 GHz processor appears to work fast...blazingly FAST.  There is no noticeable lag starting up any of my applications and was able to run a couple without any noticeable degradation in performance.The wireless connection snapped to my router immediately and makes use of either my \"g\" or \"n\" bandwidths as I choose.  I have a Samsung Galaxy III which I use as a mobile hot spot and the Sony connected to it in stride, able to make full use of the speeds that I had available.  (I have a 40 Mbps connection at home).SCREEN/DISPLAYThe image is stunning - the 1920 x 1200 display is pure eye candy and watching movies in HD on it is a portable wonder.BRIGHTNESS CONTROLThe Sony does have a separate sensor for automatic brightness control if you want to conserve your battery to the maximum intent possible.At maximum brightness, the Sony's display is eye-piercingly brilliant...I don't think that I would want it any brighter at all.  Contrast is very well done (with some of the limitations that you expect with LCDs, but top marks nonetheless) and colors are very well produced and rich without oversaturation.SOUND QUALITYSimply ok.  The onboard speakers get the job done, but I found the Kindle speakers to be more impressive as a standalone audio device.  That said, I typically use my headphones or my Bluetooth speaker anyway, so this is not a huge disappointment for me.  The sound through the headphones/Bluetooth speaker is quite good.BATTERY LIFEI'd say that the battery life is probably a good 8.5 to 9.5 hours depending on your usage, the quality of your wireless connection (AND if it's on), whether you have GPS on/off, and/or your brightness setting.  It's on par with most tablets these days and I haven't noticed any significant variance between this tablet, my Kindle, or the Samsung Tab.MEMORYThis model came with 16 GB on-board, but you can insert a microSD card for additional memory, unlike the Kindle (hope you're STILL listening Amazon - memory expandability is STILL my biggest pet peeve with the Kindle Fire HD).  I placed a 32 GB Sandisk memory card in there and I dropped in a couple of movies that I like to watch from time to time.The current Android OS doesn't allow aps to be installed on the microSD card, however.  I have heard rumors that the 4.2 Android update should allow this again and Sony is supposed to be getting this update, so I'll update the review if this changes.The memory limit for me comes as one area for improvement (see Room For Improvements below).CHARGINGI'm glad that Sony has opted the use of micro USB input for file transfer and power.  The device comes with an AC adapter for that purpose, but the micro USB cable input grants you flexibility if you need it.HDMII have not tested the HDMI output but I rarely find a reason to use it since I already have a PS3 for Netflix and video viewing anyway, but an HDMI output is available on this unit.  It also has a 3.5 mm jack for headphones.BLUETOOTHAnother plus is the Bluetooth capability of the device and if you have a Bluetooth portable speaker, it's great to use with the tablet.  I have a Monster Bluetooth portable speaker and it sounds great.WATER RESISTIVITYRemarkably, this unit is water RESISTANT to a depth of 3 feet of water for up to 30 minutes.  While I don't advocate a \"check this out\" approach, the piece of mind knowing that I could read this in a bathtub, hot tub, next to the kitchen sink, etc., without having to worry about collateral splash damage is a very, very nice feature.  All of the ports (HDMI, microSD, micro USB, and headphones) have a special cover requiring fingernails to pop open.  When you shut them, they fit back with a reassuring fit to ensure water resistance.  But it's only water resistant when these ports are sealed.REMOTE CONTROLIt's a neat little feature - you can use this tablet as a remote control!!  You can select the brand, the type of device that you want to control, and with a little troubleshooting of finding the right IR schemes, you're on your way.  It took me about 2 minutes to get my TV up and running...there is even a manual setup if you want to get even fancier than that.  We own a pair of Logitech remotes, however, so we don't have too much use for it.  But my limited testing shows that this feature works quite well.CAMERAThe 8 megapixel camera that's included on the back takes pretty good pictures.  Like with any smartphone, you just need to have adequate light (see Room For Improvements below).  You can also shoot HD footage on it, but I don't see how easy that would be to use compared to a conventional camcorder.  In a pinch, however, it works pretty well.  The 2 megapixel camera on the front also works well and is satisfactory for Skype usage.SONY ENTERTAINMENTWe have a PS3 at home and we subscribe to Music Unlimited.  While this is an app that's available on smartphones, it has received poor reviews from people who have not been able to use it.  It works just fine on this tablet, however!In addition, you can connect to your online PS3 account to see what's new, what you have downloaded, etc.  However, I wish that it could do more (see Room For Improvements below).FM RADIOOk, not as many people listen to the radio anymore, but including this feature on a tablet is a cool factor for my wife.  Your headphones act as the antenna.  It's not as good as your car, but if you're listening in town, it works quite well.  Just don't expect it to work as great on the fringes where your car encounters some static (you probably won't get anything on the tablet at all).ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENTS1.  LED light.  Seriously, Sony, how did you not think of incorporating an LED light next to the camera?  They don't take a whole lot of real estate, require fairly minimal power, and is practically a standard on smartphones.  The lack of one is painfully obvious from the get-go.2.  PS3 control.  How do you include Bluetooth capability in a tablet and include an app for remote control of devices, but NOT include any functionality to be able to control the Playstation 3?!?  It's a Sony tablet...and Sony dropped the ball inexplicably in this area.  Granted, you can hook up a dual shock controller to the tablet so you can use the controller to play games ON the tablet...but why can't I pair the tablet to the PS3???3.  Price/4G/Memory.  At $499 and for the size of the tablet, I can currently get a 10\" Kindle and have 4G connectivity with 64 GB of on-board memory!  That's just one example and it's something that's not present on the Sony.  Granted, it's thinner, lighter, faster (quad-core processor)...but these are features that may likely give way to convenient data plans for some buyers.  Although the quad core processor is pretty fast, I haven't seen apps (yet) where this improvement is \"wow I must get this\" factor.  Or perhaps not...it depends on your needs.  The Sony doesn't include 4G which is not a deal-killer for me since I typically use my phone as a hot spot anyway.  However, buyer be warned and informed; there are other options in this regard and certainly at very competitive rates.Overall, it is a fantastic tablet...but there is definitely some room for improvement.Please let me know if you have any questions in the comments.", "Date": "June 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love it!!!", "Author": "KaizanRaiden", "ReviewID": "R25IKCVQD9JQFP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I chose this tablet over Samsung because it comes with Japanese.

Heath \"Gadgets, Music, & Books\"", "ReviewID": "R121678E2Q2NE4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Good:+ Thin and Light Design+ Fast Boot Up+ Great Display+ Excellent Audio+ Video Playback+ Music Playback+ Games+ Universal Remote+ Long Battery Life+ Gmail and Exchange Support+ Secure Wi-Fi - Even Corporate+ BluetoothThe Bad:- Average Browser Experience- Slow Battery Charge- Lots of Bloatware- Skimpy Storage- High Cost- Few Choices for CasesOverall:  Sony plays to their strengths delivering a great media consumption device; however, the relatively high cost for a 16GB tablet may deter some users.Design:  For the most part, Sony did an excellent job in designing the Xperia Z.  It is the thinnest and lightest 10\" tablet that I have seen to date - iPads included.  It follows the design of most Android devices in having a matte plastic back and nice rounded corners.  Users will find the headphone, micro SD, and micro USB ports hard to open unless you look in good light for the slot for your fingernail to pry them open.  The fit is snug, but this is required for the dust and water resistant design to hold up.  Don't expect the water resistant claims to hold up if you have one of these compartments open!  The only things I don't like on the design are the power and volume buttons.  The power button is small and stiff, and it gives no haptic feedback that the device has turned on.  Wait for the blue light next to the power button to flash.  The volume rocker is harsh, hard plastic that just feels out of place on a high-end device.  It does have the tactile advantage of being easy to use without looking, but this is a small concession.Setup:  Getting up and running with the Sony Xperia Z is super easy - especially if you have used other Android devices.  The main thing you will want to do is look at the diagram to find where the various ports are located and how to open them.  Once you do that, plug it in for the stated minimum of 30 minutes or until the charging light turns from yellow to green.  I did the latter, and it took about 2 hours.  After you charge the device, fire it up and enter your wireless information and Google account.  There is a small update that I recommend you download and install before getting started.  Now you are ready to rock and roll.  I should also note that the Xperia Z boots faster (average of 25 seconds) than any other Android device I've had - phones and tablets included.Media Usage:  The display on the Xperia Z is a sight to behold - capable of true 1080p playback with rich, warm colors.  When you combine this with 9 hours of battery life, you have a device that begs to play your favorite video content.  If you plan to download content for use on an airplane, I recommend adding a micro SD card since the onboard storage is a bit puny at 16 GB.  I watched videos on Netflix, Crackle, Watch ESPN, and YouTube, and the playback is outstanding with one small gripe.  When starting up a streaming video, the picture is very pixelated much like the early days of digital cable.  This smooths out once it buffers enough data, and the picture stays crisp from that point on.  The throne room scene at the beginning of Thor is nothing short of stunning.  One other thing I noticed was that navigation of the Netflix UI when selecting a video to watch is very choppy.  I believe this may be an issue with the Netflix Android app because I have observed it on other Android tablets as well.  Be that as it may, it is still disappointing to experience it on a high-end device.  It makes it feel like a cheap knockoff tablet rather than a premium device.  Make no mistake about it.  This is priced as a high-end device.Music Playback:  Just as you would expect videos to pop, sound quality on the Xperia Z also excels.  Without headphones, the four speakers produce a nice overall sound; however, bass is lacking.  When I say that, it is lacking to the point of being unbalanced in its lacking.  K'Naan's \"ABCs\" had no detectable bass line at all.  This changes altogether when I plugged in my Monster Diesel Vektr headphones.  The sound quality is every bit as good (if not better) than what my HTC Rezound produces.  Sound on streaming music and local storage is both outstanding.Gaming:  I'm not the world's biggest gamer, but I found the experience to be better than any of the other tablets I've used.  Plasma Sky was smooth with good sound quality.  I don't own any of the higher end games that would stress the processor, and thus, I cannot speak to its performance there.Universal Remote:  This is a unique feature that I haven't seen on other Android tablets.  I was able to follow the setup steps and add my LG TV and Blu-Ray player, Cisco Cable Box, and Roku with no issues.  The interface also lets you create macros to setup different activities and transitions.  The one thing missing is the Logitech Harmony functionality of knowing how to automatically transition between activities and devices at the touch of a button.  However, as a free add-on, the functionality is more than adequate.  This feature is potentially good enough to justify some of the higher cost if you do not already have something like a Harmony remote.Connectivity:  I had no issues setting up or staying connected to my WPA-2 protected Wi-Fi with a hidden SSID.  My experience was similar at work with our 802.1x user authenticated Wi-Fi.  I was also able to connect my Logitech Bluetooth keyboard and use it without any issues.  It performed as expected based on other tablets I've used.  I own Touchdown for Exchange, and I connected to my e-mail without issue.  This is somewhat of a tangent, but I highly recommend a third party e-mail app for connecting to Exchange if your company has the security PIN functionality turned on.  This limits the PIN scope and data wipe to the third party app rather than your entire device.  I don't want to have to enter a PIN every time I unlock my device even if I'm not accessing my corporate data.  Back to the Xperia - Gmail also works as expected.Complaints:  All is not positive with the Sony Xperia Z.  While battery life is good, charging time leaves something to be desired.  My rough benchmarks are about 20% battery charge per hour putting it at 5 full hours to charge after a full drain.  I work around this by dropping it on the charger anytime I put it down with 50% power or less remaining.  In addition, the browser experience on Chrome is on the lackluster side.  This is not unique to the Xperia Z as I find it underwhelming on every Android device - even the Silk accelerated browser on the Kindle Fire.  The response can also be a bit wonky as an attempted clicking on a link often results in zooming instead.  When you throw in the lack of Flash support, it makes me long for a \"real\" computer.  Then, Sony went over the top with bloatware.  They include a myriad of their music and video products along with a couple of alternate app/game stores.  The nice thing about Android 4.0 and above is that you can disable these apps so that they don't show up, but you need to root your device in order to remove them.  Finally, there are few choices in the way of cases.  The only one that looks worthwhile comes from Sony at a retail price of $79.  Amazon has a few, but my trusty standby brand Targus does not have one.  In the end, none of these is a showstopper, and they are on par with other Android tablets.  I guess I'm just holding out hope that someone will buck the trend of annoying users and taking up space with useless junk.Conclusion:  The Sony Xperia Z is an excellent media consumption tablet with a nice extra in its universal remote software.  It is a bit pricy and skimpy on storage, but the performance is better than average.

It's lightweight, it has excellent battery life, and the screen is to die for!  Plus there is a memory card slot, so basically it has unlimited storage.  Really it's the nicest tablet I have seen, from a pure hardware perspective.My single issue has to do with the operating system, and yes I know it's not really fair to deduct a star based on the operating system, but from the perspective of the end user, the tablet and its operating system are one and the same.So, as a longtime iPad user (and owner of a Kindle Fire), I will try to post an 'end user' review.Firstly the issue of storage is a big one that has always annoyed me about the iPad.  As I discovered myself just last week, while sitting 3 hours on the tarmac in a plane waiting for takeoff clearance for a 4 hour flight, it is important for a tablet to carry plenty of movies and videos.  Apple's absolute refusal to add a memory card slot to iPad limits the amount of video it can carry.I thought the problem would be solved with this new Sony tablet, and indeed the storage is pretty much unlimited.  However the ability to find and download movies and videos is a problem.  My usual sources are Amazon's own video service (which has an iPad app for downloading), and iTunes.  You can forget both of those for this Android tablet.  Apple's DRM protection makes downloading to Android a non-starter, and Amazon has so far not produced an Android app that will allow its video service to download to anything but a Kindle Fire.  Netflix and Hulu work wonderfully on the tablet, but at 35,000 feet streaming video isn't happening.  It does come with Google Play, and I believe you can download from that, but I have a large collection of videos in various clouds that will work in the iPad and not on Android.  If you want to carry your own copy of a movie, you will have to buy the DVD and rip it yourself, or buy a DVD that has a digital copy included.  Both work fine on Android and look great on this tablet.It's sad that a clear winner in the tablet market (like this Sony) is marred by the draconian policies of other retail/media giants, but there it is.That being said, if you use and like Android, this is the tablet for you.  And it's water-resistant.  In theory you could drop it in the pool and it would survive.
