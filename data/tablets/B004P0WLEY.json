You may or may have already know that acer support is extremely bad!! This is what happened to me, I bought this unique laptop from Microsoft store on blackfriday, first this item is a complete mess, it is one of those unfinished products or just a prototype feeling to it, what makes matter worse is that they don't or never intend on supporting it, no update nothing. For window 8, forget about it.  It will run on windows 8 but no new driver or AcerRing support.  Do not, do not, don't buy Acer products.  I have to send this laptop for fixes on the first two week, problem was that the screen will have touching flickering all over the screen randomly and I never touch the screen. When this happen you can not do anything but to hard reset and turn the laptop off, the fan would run and all the key is locked.  Want to know what make it worse, 1st time sending it back, they installed window 7 and all the drivers, it could have done that and did it. Came back not fix!! Put up with it for a few more months not sure what to do, drive me crazy, so I send it back the second time, this time they change the hard drive and also there a little cracked where the power button is like the tech pried it over to hard, came back..not fix, by this time my warranty ran out and Acer pretty much told me to go screw myself!!  How about that for tech support.  If they do not intend to support the laptop they should not sell it nor should they bring out prototype to the market.  Oh you bet its cool to look at and get many complement but little did they know that its heavy, slow (run on iCore 5 first gen.)the battery does not last more than 2 hours, so a constant plug in for me.  The biggest joke of all is that you hardly ever use the bottom screen for anything movies, games ....etc.  you just don't know why you need or have it.  Virtual keyboard is a joke too, at least for touch typist like me.....so summary.....suck bad!!  Lucky I bought it on BF or else I died paying full price!!", "Date": "December 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Works well, even better with Win8", "Author": "Andrew Zimmer", "ReviewID": "R33A4706GWFFEK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "With the original OS, Windows 7 home Premium, this machine was a capable business/office use laptop with the unique option to put two screens of content up at once.With Windows 8 Pro on it, it is greatly improved.  The touch screens work out of the box (adding Acer's Win7 x64 drivers helps with fine-grained precision). The touch-centric interface thrives on an all touch laptop and the built in text-prediction works well too, adding with the machines one weak spot: intensive text entry.It's a great machine for lots of things (in my case, I often put VMware on one screen, my office work/web browser on the other) and the presence of two physical screens means many \"full screen\" programs can be dedicated to one or the other...it does help though if you carry some kind of small stand to prop it up, that makes the lower (keyboard) screen much easier to read.One thing that would be a huge plus is if Acer's BIOS dealt with 16GB ram better.  You can install 8GB sticks in both slots (unlike many contemporary Core i5 First Generation), but it then acts up more often, making the trade-off hard to justify.  Perhaps a BIOS update will fix that, who knows?", "Date": "December 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Worked Great with Windows 8 BUT NOT WITH RTM!", "Author": "Tek2000", "ReviewID": "R1CD2J8G4EK32I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "EDIT 120816:  WARNING WARNING WARNING - Windows 8 Release to Manufacturers (RTM) Enterprise drivers do not work for the Acer Iconia.  You do not get the option to select a second touch screen.  (Actually, this seems likely to be a bug in Windows 8 to me.  Surely many people will have multiple touch screens attached?)  You cannot flip the orientation of either tablet individually. If you say extend the desktop, it mysteriously changes back to duplicated on its own when you exit the configuration screen.  Why did microsoft do this?  The drivers were working fine in the Customer Preview except that it said you wouldn't get the full pleasure of windows 8.  now i don't get any pleasure at all.Since I bought this dual touch tablet for Windows 8 testing and ultimately its use, I have a really expensive paperweight now.  Please Acer, provide drivers for the dual touch tablets in w8 asap!  You should also provide your keyboard and windows utilities that you did for windows 7.  Please rush now that the RTM is out.***************original review follows**************Windows 8 Customer Preview (free from Microsoft) finally gave me the excuse I was hunting for to justify buying this toy.  I saw some videos of the two working together on youtube (thanks to gameveda for posting them), and also some tips on how to easily get both touchscreens working as input devices.It is indeed working fairly well--far better than you would expect a so-called \"beta\" version to work, that is.  It has hung up a couple of times, though, so I'd recommend doing dual boot until the final Windows 8 comes out if you depend upon the Iconia as your primary machine.To be extra safe for the installation, you can use the built-in \"eRecovery\" utilities to create recovery DVD's (takes an external USB DVD-writer and 5 blank single density DVDs).  You can also order the media ready-made from Acer.  I also created the utilities and applications DVD.  That's a good thing because I plan on trying to install some of the Acer software in Windows 8!Microsoft could learn a little about handling multiple touch monitors from Acer.  For example, there is no way (that I've discovered) to use touch in Windows 8 to get windows from one screen to the other when they're stacked vertically like this.  Acer software adds two buttons on the upper right of every window, one of which, when you touch it, puts finger-friendly size buttons on the corners for resizing. The other button snaps the window to the other screen.  This button is also very convenient when using the mouse.[update 3/21/2012:  I've found that if I turn ON auto-hide [default is off] for the task bar, I can slide a window between monitors that are vertically stacked.  Just enough of the upper border shows on the other monitor to complete the movement if I'm careful with finger placement.  Better would be the Acer type buttons or a flick command when moving towards this edge.]Installation was easy, except that for some bizarre reason (like I said, Microsoft could take some lessons from Acer on multiple touch screen usage), the way that you identify touchscreens in Windows 8 requires you to press the ENTER KEY ON A KEYBOARD!?!?!?!  You touch the screen to show that it's a touch screen, but then the only way to move on to the next screen is to press enter!  Anyway, have a keyboard handy when setting up. :-)There seems to be some question about it in various reviews, but mine came with an external USB card reader.  Swapping out the memory for Corsair 8GB (2x 4GB) 1333mhz PC3-10666 204-pin DDR3 SODIMM Laptop Memory Kit CMSO8GX3M2A1333C9 takes no tools.  It's probably not really necessary for most day to day usage, but memory is a real bargain right now and you never know what kind of applications you might want to try on this thing eventually!  My iconia did not come with bluetooth.CONS:  weight and battery life.Hmmm.  How will I justify getting the newer version with the \"ultrabook\" i7 ivy bridge chips?  Hmmm.  Maybe to run the final version of Windows 8 when it comes out? Hmmm.Edit 6/5/2012:  Installed W8 Release Preview.  Sliding in from the sides to get the \"charms\" or the thumbnails of open apps works much more easily now.  M/S fixed the first of the two requirements for the external keyboard during setup.  Now the second touch screen asks if it's a touch screen automatically after you touch the first.  However, you still need the kb to press enter on the second touchscreen to exit that configuration.  I never did get most of the Acer add-on running but didn't complain since they weren't really written for W8.  ACER, WE ARE READY FOR THESE NOW!  Particularly need the ability to move a window vertically between screens with your fingers rather than the mouse!", "Date": "March 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great device, poor battery", "Author": "The Engineer", "ReviewID": "R2GFERRJG8RO7G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros: I am an inbound college student going into Mechanical Engineering. I as told that I need some sort of tablet pc, so bought this device over an hp elitebook. As the previous poster said, this is NOT a tablet, it is a combination of a notebook and a tablet, taking some of the best features of both. If you want a tablet I recommend the Iconia A500.The touch screen is phenomenal(which is, by the way, protected by the nearly indestructible gorilla glass.) I have very oversized fingers, and many times have problems with accuracy on touch screens. On the Iconia, I am just as accurate as I am on an ipod touch, which has the leading touch screen for the last 5 years.Along with the touch screen comes the touch keyboard, which I know is a bit of a scare for some people. It is not hard to adjust, and I am personally very fast on this keyboard, even faster than on a normal keyboard because of the sensitivity. Your fingers will fly across the touch keyboard once you get used to it.The touch software on this notebook is very fun to use. It works just as advertised, and I love using touch photo, music, and video. It also includes a few Microsoft Surface programs, such as virtual earth 3D(very cool), a photography program to create collages, and a fish tank \"lagoon\" screen saver that is responsive to your touch. If you use windows media player, the touch screen makes it even easier to use and better than ever.As far as ports go, the Iconia 6120 has anything that you will need for todays use. USB 3.0, USB 2.0, VGA, HDMI, Ethernet, headphone and microphone. It also comes with a memory card reader which i have found to be very useful. It is missing an optical drive, but in todays world this is rarely used... programs are downloaded online, and movies are stored directly on the device and transferred via USB 3.0 at high speeds.It is very easy to add memory. The whole bottom of the Notebook slides offCons: Now for the cons. Unfortunately for you gamers, this is not the laptop for you. The intel HD graphics will not be good enough for any graphic-intensive games that you would like to play.Battery life is REALISTICALLY 1.5 hours... unacceptably short. And I have found no way to replace the battery which means I am stuck.Missing bluetooth, so you must buy a USB adapter if you really need this.I cannot understand WHY Acer only included the last gen i5 processor. The Notebook is plenty fast, but I still would have liked to have the current processor.Now for a bit of a story. I bought this notebook from Microsoft Store online, and bought Microsoft signature Premium for better support. The device worked perfectly, except that the touch browser software would crash every time I closed a tab... annoying right? So I called up Microsoft premium support and after a few days found that microsoft signature was conflicting with the touch software and causing the crash. So I called Acer and they tell me that I need to buy a warranty... what? After a few angry phone calls the microsoft technician did a conference call and then my limited warranty magically appeared. I finally got to send in to get repaired for free by acer, and upon receiving it I found a new problem. The touch browser was fixed, but the touch screen would randomly click all over the op screen. After another week on the phone with microsoft, we found that it was a hardware issue that appeared when it was sent to the repair center...? Again, I was able to send it in, and long story short Acer customer service SUCKS!!! It takes about 45 minutes of hold music before a rep will answer the phone, and unless you get teh second tier service, they are all indians that dont know what they are talking about and you cannot understand a damn thing they say. Buy another type of service like signature premium if you can. The guys at microsoft are very nice and very helpful. After all of that, It works very smooth and I love it.Full Review:Overall I am very happy with my purchase, I was expecting some sort of problem with such new bleeding edge technology so I was not very upset learning that I had to send it in. I WAS upset with Acers customer service though.As far as the actual notebook goes, It is exactly what I wanted and works better than expected. Would recommend to anyone who is remotely interested and doesnt mind having a terrible battery life", "Date": "August 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good product, not for everyone!", "Author": "Joyson D. Martinez", "ReviewID": "R43F41HLGSGB9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Acer Iconia-6120 14-Inch Dual-Screen TouchbookAfter I test this product this is my point of view:Good:Innovate design with two screen, i5 CPU, great quality display. Its a little bit bulky but I can survive, (6.x pounds). When you work with this computer you can feel the weight like a Macbook Pro 17\", or like a Dell Inspiron 15\". The top display have a very good quality and its touch screen have fast response. The bottom screen doesn't have the same quality screen like the other one. Have 10 point multitouch screen, yes you can use your 10 fingers. The typing speed is very good, sometimes you can make errors because you don't feel the keyboard like a regular notebook but is ok. The bottom screen have a little distortion in the images and its not good for reading.To replace the hard disk and the ram is very easy.The virtual keyboard have a lot of setting and you can change the skins.Good aluminum top a bottom case materials.Bad:Its a i5, I feel a little lag in the OS. The OS is full of bloatware I think that is the reason of the lag of the Windows 7. Sometimes its a very slowly running basics apps like installing or opening a Antivirus. I replace the Hard disk with a SSD and I change the memory to 8GB DDR 1333 that was good for the speed. No bluetooth, you can use and external mini usb bluetooth card, but is not a good think for the design.The borders of the housing have cheap plastic. If you clean the computer with a microfiber cloth you can easily scratch the notebook. Have the same black glossy plastic like the first Acer netbooks, easy to scratch it.The software controls using the virtual keyboard and the acer ring are very good, but needs to have upgrades. (Acer need to work more with facebook app sometimes are very basic and the pictures have distortion).Battery charge 2 hours, if you see videos in youtube or Hulu (1.5 Hours Aprox). Two AC/DC adapters??? Why??? You need to use two AC/DC power adapter to charge it (The basic one and filter for the screens).In basic words:A revolutionary notebook that needs some little changes to be perfect. First I was disappointed with the lower graphics in the bottom screen. Two screens are great but need to have the same quality. The Intel i5 cpu is not the last one in the market, I think replacing the Intel i5 for the new Intel CPU Sandy Bridge can help the battery and the overheating.The 2 hours battery need to be fix it, you can't travel with this computer in a airplane or use it in a Starbucks.If you buy this computer its very important to re-install a fresh OS with out bloatware, that help you in the speed. Good for people that works with Photoshop or are Software Developers. Great for geeks, you can feel like a Star Trek movies. Intel HD graphics are good for videos this laptops is not for game. Overheating after 1 hour of use.Its not compatible with Ubuntu Linux or Mint Linux, the computer scratch after the boot installation.I recommend this product only for PC Technician or Graphic Artist.

Being a graphic designer the sensible thing to do would get a Macbook pro.....but i don't care for the OS,and i do believe that you pay for the apple logo more than anything, the good points to the acer iconia 6120 is for me the virtual keyboard i can type on it as fast maybe even faster than a normal keyboard and the touchscreens are smooth and really very responsive-Good Points- virtual keyboard for me is fantastic- Acer's software runs well and is very helpful nicely designed also- not as heavy as anticipated still very manageable- Beautifully design with the metal plates on either side as champagne color and the gloss black around screens and very well designed software by acer along side windows 7 (i would say however to leave at windows 7 upgrading to windows 8 proves a struggle)- Very, very very fast!!!! 2.66ghz with intel turbo boost to 2.97ghz (3ghz)its a monster, yes you do get the first generation i5 peocessor but it works, and I've read with 2nd generation the only real improvement would be battery Life but i'll address later in the review....Bad Points- battery life is poor but taking into account the two HD 14\" Inch touchscreens it's not bad i can get 3.5 hrs with work on microsoft Word and Adobe Photoshop.- sometimes it will ghost type it will freeze for about 10 seconds and then little touch indicators are in a fraction of the screen but this happens maybe once every week, i have noticed however that tilting the screen fixing the problem when happening.Overall i would give the Iconia 4 Out Of 5 brilliant design and i really useful tool for my studies, just loosing some points for some problemsthe advice i can give if you can afford it is buy it give it a go, i wasn't disappointed and yu shouldn't be the only alternative is the toshiba libretto but after trying it it lacks feom the mite of the acer iconia 6120...and if your still unsure wait for any advancements in this technology there are only two of this kindo and they won't be the last this i think is how future laptops will be like, this then is genesis..", "Date": "February 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Future Is Now", "Author": "StreetGamer", "ReviewID": "RH0A3D5JXGP2B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like so much this Touchbook!!Is one advance in notebook area.
