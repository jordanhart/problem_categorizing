{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Simple Review", "Author": "Londonnoise \"Robby\"", "ReviewID": "R2HXW1596QTAJL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There are 1001 iPad reviews of varying detail out there and you don't need me to slog you through every little feature. Figuring what you want to know is, \"Is it worth the upgrade?\"Well yes and no.If you are already using an iPad with a retina display (and the display IS pant-wettingly gorgeous), you're going to get a sleeker, lighter, faster version of the same thing. Sure, the camera is a bit improved, but don't you think that people look odd trying to take photos on an iPad? For me, that's not what this is designed for.The first thing you'll notice when you pick it up is how sleek and light it is compared to previous models. It really is a beautifully designed and built tablet. It' also noticeably (but not hugely with the apps I tested) faster. iOS 7 looks fab on the thing.Still, the bottom line is, if you are running a pre-retina iPad and you got the cash, yes, it's worth it (and I use 'worth' as a loose term here, they are bloody expensive). If you are running a newer iPad, sure, this is sleeker and shinier, but I'm afraid it's not going to change your life.To conclude, this thing is beautiful, extremely useful in my life, and I love it like the child I never had :-) Just don't expect it to change your whole life!", "Date": "November 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "iPad Air was a great buy!  You won't regret it!", "Author": "EvansDJ82", "ReviewID": "R3D3OD7YY7Q22E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased this at a recently run promo at the local Best Buy ($150 in gift cards that I received for the purchase was promptly used to offset it's higher cost).It is a 5-star tablet in everyway.  I'm fully invested in Amazon media and am glad that Amazon saw fit to put all it's services onto the iPad Air via apps so that I can access it seamlessly.  I have both the HDX 8.9 and the Air even though the HDX 8.9 has a better screen, I prefer reading books and magazines on the iPad Air because of the 4:3 aspect ratio.  I also am happy that I got it because it is apparently the only tablet that works on my company's internal network.The HDX 8.9 is better for video watching, particularly if you're watching without headphones.  The speakers on it are amazing.  However, the speakers on the Air aren't bad, they're  just too close together to practically be stereo.That said, both the HDX 8.9 and the Air are 5-star tablets.  They have different strengths and do different things well.  The HDX 8.9 is now my son's and the iPad Air is mine (because of it's work functionality).You really can't go wrong with either tablet.", "Date": "December 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "iPad lover", "Author": "J. M. Kahn \"Gizmo Lover\"", "ReviewID": "R3QIG90IQFIVZV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had first purchased the iPad when it first came out, wasn't impressed and returned it.  Bought the 2nd version, loved it and have had it ever since.  When they came out with the 3rd version I wasn't impressed with the changes so I kept my iPad 2.  Ditto when they came out with the next version.  But I saw the iPad Air in person and had a chance to try it for myself.  I loved the new camera (much more defined pictures) and the screen definition (it's now hi-def).  Beautiful sharp, clear colors.  So I upgraded and bought it (I bought the white one though.)  I was fortunate that the place I bought the iPad Air from accepted my iPad 2 as a trade in so I got it for approximately $200 less (my iPad was in immaculate condition and I still had the box, paperwork and the accessories.)  I do love this iPad.  It's fast, fast, fast and my games are beautiful.  I have both Microsoft and Apple products (although no Apple computers, they're too expensive.)  Both have their merits, but I have to say one thing for the Apple products, upgrading to new devices and transferring all your programs, particularly games, is so much easier.  On Microsoft products, with Windows, you have to reinstall all of your games and programs, and with the games pray that the new operating system will let you play your old games.  In most cases it won't and you have to go through a bunch of iterations to play them (and I say this while typing on an HP Laptop which I use daily and would rather DIE than go without it!)  I don't know why Microsoft, (maybe it's the game developers) won't let you back up your games or the programs like Excel, Word, etc (even though you've already paid for them.)  But with Apple you just attach it to your computer  and sync it (hopefully you backed up your iPad, or whatever, to it) and voila, all your previous games, music, programs are on the Apple product ready to use just where you left off (most of the time anyway.  On a few of the games I had to start from the beginning, but I think that's because of the developer, not the iPad because some of them I did start where I left off.)  Also, set up for programs such as mail is minimal (just put in your user name and password and you're ready to go.)  I wish Microsoft would come out with something like that so I could purchase a new computer without the fear of not being able to play my favorite games.  Anyway, bottom line I LOVE my new iPad Air.  I even found a case that allows me to swivel the stand to either landscape or portrait positions so that I can read the newspaper or books on it and eat at the same time without having to try and prop it up on something (bought the case on Amazon.com, it's a Targus Versavu).", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Incredibly light, fast and beautiful. Is it the best tablet for you?", "Author": "John Ryan", "ReviewID": "R3W2AOZWQH82BD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The new iPad Air is Apple's latest, slimmest, lightest release of their hand-held computer. Oddly enough, it's so beautifully easy to use (my one year old daughter loves playing with it), it's almost doesn't feel like a computer at all.A word of warning - this review is written for people who've never owned an iPad before - and are wondering what all the fuss is about. If you're thinking of upgrading skip down to the \"What's great about the Air\" section below, or just buy it - it's amazing.Just what's all the fuss about?--------------------------------------I used to own a laptop for work, and (very occasionally), it'd sit on my lap on the sofa, and I'd use it for pleasure (eMail, watching films or playing the odd game). Then I bought my first iPad, and the laptop became redundant, a boring \"work device\". Hard to explain, but the fact the iPad is so small and light, and you navigate around with your finger by pointing and gently swiping the screen makes the whole experience a lot easier - a lot more fun.Even my most \"luddite\" of friends have been won over.It's incredibly simple and easy to use (it only has one main button), and everyone from my one year old daughter to my 85 year old dad have taken to without problems. It's size and shape also support using it like a book (literally to read a book or web page), but you can also watch TV and films.Personally I'm also paranoid about my password getting \"hacked\", and someone running up a huge Amazon bill or buying stuff with my credit card on eBay. Well one of the benefits of the iPad (and iPhone) is it's \"almost impossible\" to get a virus - one of the most common ways to get hacked. This doesn't mean you shouldn't use strong passwords, (both Sony and Adobe got hacked), but it's reassuring to leave the Windows world behind.Finally, I love the way these devices (iPad, iPhone, Apple TV, Apple Mac), increasingly work together. The fact you can start a Pages document on your Mac and edit it on your iPad, or take photos on the iPhone, and in seconds see them on the iPad or Mac and display them on the Apple TV.The thing is, \"it just works\".What would you use if for?----------------------------------* Shopping online. Obviously - you could be reading a review on Amazon about the iPad Air!* Reading web pages. As you can hold it like a book it's great to read the news online (my wife loves the Daily Mail Online).* Reading Books. It's great for reading books from Amazon Kindle or Apple Books with the benefit of 1,000s of online book reviews* Navigating web pages. Instead of clicking with a mouse, you gently swipe your fingers on screen to scroll around* Watching Films. I use it to watch Netflix online videos (with an Apple TV you can send stuff to the telly)* Watching TV. With the free BBC iPlayer app you can catch up or download BBC programs* Reading and replying to mail. I use \"mailbox\" a great free app to read and reply to mails, but there's a free one included* Showing and organising photos. Any photos on an iPhone are automatically available within minutes in \"the cloud\"* Playing games. From fun puzzle games like \"Cut the Rope\" to fully fledged first person shooters.* Listening to the Radio. With \"Tune in Radio\" you can listen to thousands of radio stations world-wide.* Listening to music. I stream mine to an Apple TV, but you can also buy portable speakers or just plug into the AUX socket* Editing Word, Excel and Powerpoint documents using FREE App \"QuickOffice\" (owned and supported by Google).* Editing Pages, Numbers and Keynote documents (Office for the Apple) on the FREE Apple apps.* The list goes on and on.Update: You can edit Word, Excel and Powerpoint documents (plus Pages, Numbers and Keynote) on the iPad (although I'd recommend an external keyboard - see below). It's definately powerful enough, although I'd not expect these apps to cope with REALLY complex document layouts. Great for general letter and document writing though.Which model should I buy?----------------------------------I can't comment about Android tablets (apart from the Google Nexus 7 which is well regarded), but in terms of the Apple tablet line-up in order of cost:-1. Avoid the Apple iPad 2, it's a relatively old model, under-powered and with a lower resolution screen. If you really want an Apple but don't want to spend the cash, buy a 16g WIFI 3rd or 4th generation iPad from eBay. Avoid this one.2. iPad mini is a lovely tablet. A 7.9 inch screen and astonishingly light and remarkably thin - it feels like a light-weight book.3. iPad mini with retina screen. Again 7.9 inch screen, but with the blazingly fast A7 chip and a \"retina\" (high definition) screen. Worth the upgrade if you can afford it.4. iPad Air. Much larger screen size (9.7 inches - doesn't sound much but it makes a huge difference). Same fast (A7) chip as the Mini with Retina - the latest and fastest iPad available.Clearly (from my viewpoint) there's only really three options. The iPad Mini, the Mini with retina screen and Air.What are the Optional add-ons?-----------------------------------------Well, assuming you've dropped by the Apple Store or John Lewis (which I would highly recommend), and handled the iPad Mini (with/without retina screen), and iPad Air then your options are around memory size and cellular option.Memory: Once bought, you can't add memory (space for apps, films, books etc). However, the basic price goes up a huge amount (+\u00a380 for the 16g to 32g iPad Air). But, having owned a 16g and then a 32g iPad - I can safely recommend the 16g unless you really want to store a huge amount of videos and downloads. Only you can decide, and if you're lucky enough that money is no object then splash out. Otherwise, 16g should be fine for most people.Celular: Allows you to connect to the internet while you're out and about. This will add an additional +\u00a3100 to the price and means you can slip in a mobile phone SIM card. This means (for an additional \u00a37-15 a month extra), you can access the internet on the move. Alternatively, you can opt for the WIFI option, and use it at home or at at \"hot spot\" (eg. Starbucks, most rail stations and hotels etc).Personally I'd buy (and indeed did), the 16Gb iPad Air WIFI.Do I need anything else?-------------------------------Most people (me included) buy a cover. Apple (and now several copy-cats) make a \"smart-cover\" which automatically shuts down the iPad when you close it, and switches it on when you open it. There's versions which cover the back, or just the screen. Apple charge from \u00a335 to \u00a365 for their (admittedly) high quality fabric or leather covers, but there's many available from \u00a310. Be aware, you do get what you pay for.Personally,I think it's a pity to cover the beautiful aluminium industrial design of the iPad with a cover - but if you've spent hundreds of pounds you'll want to protect it from scrapes and bangs.I also invested in a keyboard (\u00a325-80), as I tend to write a lot of mails and documents (remember it comes with a word processor). I'd recommend the Logitech Ultra Thin iPad Air Case with Keyboard - Space Greyand the ZAGG Keys iPad Air Case Folio with Backlit Keyboard - Black although these are strictly optional unless you want to use your iPad as a proper laptop.Finally, if you have another Apple device (eg. an iPhone, Apple TV or Mac) you'll find these work together beautifully. For example, you can create a reminder on your iPad and it appears on your iPhone. Equally, photos taken on your iPhone appear on your iPad, and you can stream music or videos from iPad, iPhone or Mac to an Apple TV.Some people think this \"locks you in\" - but it's your choice.What's great about the Air?-----------------------------------* Lighter (30%) and thinner than the previous version (469g from 650g)* Even faster A7 chip. Blazingly fast!* Improved sound (compared to the iPad 4)* Software including+ iMovie - edit and publish home made movies+ Numbers - Fully functional Excel for the iPad+ Pages - Word processor+ GarageBand - Play a piano or a drum kit+ iPhoto - Edit and organise your photosWhat's not so great?--------------------------* The change in physical size means you'll need a new keyboard or replacement cover if you're upgrading* Pity Apple didn't include the \"touch ID\" to secure your passwordsOverall Opinion---------------------It's hard to believe the iPad version 1 was released just four years ago, and there's a huge raft of \"me too\" tablet computers to choose from, but the Apple iPad Air is still the one to beat. As \"Which?\" magazine (in the UK) put it - \"...the best tablet we've ever tested. Apple packs a beautiful screen and lightning fast processor into a slimmer-than-ever shell, and battery life is very impressive\".Yes, there are cheaper Android based alternatives, but the quality, design and beauty of this tablet just sets it apart. If it were a car it'd be a top of the range Mercedes or a BMW.Highly Recommended.", "Date": "February 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great, even for an Android fan.", "Author": "Xachary Dinsmore", "ReviewID": "RSJSN0GPTVMU4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have historically been an Android person, However, this time I decided to give Apple a whirl. In comparison to an Android device it is far less customizable. You don't get to install different keyboards, or load widgets onto 8 different home screens, or install a completely different launcher all together, but this doesn't mean it's all bad. The user interface is very simplistic, but that actually works fairly well on a screen this size. The only thing that really sucks about it is that you can't hide the infrequently used apps quietly off to the side in the app screen like you can with Android. You are staring at all the apps at once from the home screen mo matter what. Even all neatly organized in folders it can still be a little hard to find what you are looking for. This coupled with the lack of information on the home screen(such as you get from a widget) would make me really dislike this on a small phone screen. It does work fairly well with the 10\" screen though, and the multi touch gestures make switching between apps and multi tasking a breeze.  This thing is extremely fast as well, you really can't slow it down. 10 browser tabs open, streaming music, playing a game, and checking your email, all while jumping back and forth between them is completely seamless. It literally feels like you can't feed it input fast enough to make it even stumble a little.  The battery life is also excellent. You will be hard pressed to kill it in a day. You would have to be gaming on it for hours to accomplish a dead battery I would think. I think the battery life is the perfect balance, to increase it any would in my opinion probably mean a sacrifice to either performance or weight and size. I typically get about 2 days of moderate use out of it.  For those of you on the edge between this and an Android device(or the constantly improving world of Windows mobile), the App Store selection is about the same. For the types of apps I use there seems to be very little difference, the are both excellent for social media, media consumption, email, and browsing the web. I do somewhat prefer the BaconReader reddit client app for android over what I have found here, but that is a very minor complaint. There are a few apps that are paid on iOS that you can get for free on Android, but at the same time there are more tablet specific apps on iOS, so I think it's a fair trade off.As far as day to day use goes it has been impeccable and I would recommend it to anyone. It has been reliable, fast, and had great battery life, any complaints are minor and subjective. In case Amazon rolls my review in with all the iPad Air models, which they probably will, I have the 32GB white version. I would also recommend avoiding the 16GB, after everything is all updated and the included free apps installed, you will only have a couple GB left for apps and media.", "Date": "March 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best tablet for normal people.", "Author": "T.

One of the first things that jumps out about this device, beyond the gorgeous display and excellent speed, is the long lasting battery life.  I have owned this tablet since the day it came out, and I am still averaging about 10 hours of battery life on it.  That is a good thing, too, because if one gets this tablet, they will be using it a lot.  That is, by and large, due to the tremendous versatility that the iPad Air provides it users with.  I have effectively utilized this tablet at both work and in my graduate courses, and by my judgement, my performance has seen a boost by consequence of that.With that in mind, it must be acknowledged that the iPad Air, or more generally, apple products are more expensive.  Critics of the iPad often point to that very fact, but a \"premium\" price boost to a top of the line product is not unique to the iPad - the nicest things are also invariably the most expensive things.  Because this tablet is so well made, there will typically be very little to no frustration associated with it.  It gets the job done across the board, be it for personal or professional use.  It is for that reason that the iPad Air is worth the extra $100-300. As a graduate student, I cringed at my bank account after I purchased this, but at this point, I'm honestly relieved that I got the iPad.  $600 may seem like a lot at first, but by the time a month has gone by, and one realizes how much they actually use this thing, that $600 will start to seem like a small price to pay.  Once a former galaxy tablet loyalist - now firmly in the iPads corner.  Truly, this is such a well made device - it really doesn't get better than the iPad Air right now, and it probably won't until the next IPAs either.", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Buyer Beware", "Author": "Voenix Rising", "ReviewID": "R11YB5ZRVSQ3BX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "While technically ALL iPad Airs are \"unlocked,\" and can be used on most any carrier, I was extremely dismayed to learn that the Air I received from TechGiant arrived with an IMEI (a hardware identity number unique to every device) that was locked to AT&T.; Because of that lock, it's not just a simple matter of swapping out the SIM card to get it on the carrier of your choice. In my case, Verizon had to scan the IMEI of one of their own devices in order to activate one of their own SIMs to use in this Air so that it could be added to my existing account and used on their network. Yes, in the end it worked, but it was a huge hassle and if I'd known beforehand that the device would arrive this way I would not have purchased it from this seller, instead going directly to Apple or Verizon.", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Well Apple you finally got me", "Author": "Danamite", "ReviewID": "R34DQA57YUOFR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I managed to avoid 5 generations of ipad purchases (including the 1st generation mini) but this one finally got me. My eye doctor told me if I didn't stop being ridiculous and using my itouch as an ereader (I know, I know but it was so portable!) I could kiss my 20-20 vision goodbye. Basically Apple can thank my optometrist. That being said this thing is gorgeous. It takes beautiful photos and video, the screen is crisp and clear. While I don't run around in public taking photos and video with it I'm happy it has the capability. It's great for watching movies on the go and I've been very happy with the battery life.So why should you buy this one? It's a reasonable size without sacrificing screen size or quality. I think the ipad mini is cute but I have friends who practically have smartphones with a screen that size. It wasn't worth the price for me. We have other ipad products in my family, I've never been motivated enough to go out and buy my own but this one is a good size. It fits in a normal size bag or purse and makes me feel like I'm carrying around a pad of paper rather than a small laptop.I've had several people ask me why I bought a ipad instead of a kindle fire or the like. As I said, we have a lot of iproducts at my house and I'm very happy with itunes. This way I can easily swap movies, tv shows, ebooks, various apps I need on a daily basis around and basically this has turned into a backup laptop for me. The functionality was absolutely worth it to me.I guess if I were to say anything negative it would be 1) I'm never going to live down finally having bought one after saying I wouldn't for so many years and 2) my iphone and itouch now seem incredibly small.

I mentioned Samsung because I love their phones, tv's, etc. However, when comparing the note to the iPad, I opted for the iPad. One very big reason is I love to buy, rent, download movies to watch. Having an iTunes account makes this so very simple. Also, I have a ton of iTunes credit (I always ask for iTune gift cards whenever the occassion arises). In addition to iTunes, I love Pages. When I got this app, it was free! However, if you do a lot of word processing, you might want to invest in this much needed addition. The great thing about Pages is you can send as a PDF or Word doc via email.Some are trying to decide if they should buy a 16, 32, 64, etc. Speaking from experience, a 16 will not be enough for must adults, but would be fine for a child. I know you can store in the \"cloud\". However, you have to have a wifi in order to retrieve from the \"cloud\" unless you have the iPad with a cellular service (which to me, is a waste). So, having your documents available whenever needed is a plus. Therefore, a minimum of 32 would be great.All said, I love gadgets and technology. I love having the latest, and that is why with each new model, I will upgrade. However, I think this iPad air will be mine for many years - of course I say that until the next iPad air comes out with the finger print scanner and I will tell myself, \"must have\".If you own one, enjoy!

I had problems on my 3rd gen keeping it charged compared to the zippier charging Air.Lightning port is much more convenient, easier to plug in compared to 3rd generation and back.Speakers seem to pack more of a punch.What doesn't work:the screen has a slightly hollow and thin feel on the finger. As a consequence of a lighter tablet it's expected that the display lost some of it's heft.the volume buttons are spaced a little too far apart for me. Harder to press.volume speakers are annoyingly where you'd hold the tablet horizontally.-----That's my impressions with the tablet. My recommendation is if you have $500 or more to spend on a tablet, the iPad Air is going to be your first choice. Android hasn't been competitive in this section of the market. If you're looking for a less expensive, smaller tablet, then you're going to be looking at the Kindle devices or the Android devices.For Apple users, i'd recommend people on the 1st and 2nd gen devices take the plunge, the changes are enough to warrant the upgrade. 3rd Gen users are in the grey area. They are not going to see any difference in screen quality, and the speed of the Air may not be too large to matter for basic use. 4th Gen users are totally fine where they are.", "Date": "November 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "REPLACED MY IPAD 3, WAS IT A GOOD DECISION? LETS FIND OUT. IN DEPTH.", "Author": "Kanwar Anand", "ReviewID": "R104L6A6P3VSAW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my third iPad. I decided on a 32GB because I wanted to load movies on it and a lot of music and not worry about space. I mean when they announce a new version of iOS the last thing I wanted to do was delete something dear to me. I was replacing my iPad 3 16GB with an iPad Air 32GB. There have been many changes. Are these changes enough to warrant the need for an upgrade? I am still not entirely certain but I am more happy than sad about doing that. I haven't been able to sell my iPad 3 but its still looking for a new home. So guys, here is what I like about the iPad Air, what I don't like much and what are some key features or new introductions to this device.The Positives of Upgrading to iPad Air -1) It is lighter, the surface area around the display has been reduced, the design is not revolutionary by any length of a realistic understanding of science but it still has the same battery life. It has lost that annoying 30 pin connector which seems so inconvenient to the new lightning port. I can use this one hand, I can expect the same battery life, the volume button on the iPad 3 seemed less delicate, the iPad Air definitely feels a lot more delicate than the iPad 3 which seems so robust now when I pick it up. But overall I would give them 4 stars for the design changes.  I wish it never heated up though but purely from the WEIGHT difference I think its good, the screen for some reason looks better, it must be the upgraded graphic chip.2) The Sound - This is the biggest winner for me. Imagine not having to turn the sound to 100% on your iPad air. It rivals my matchbook air in terms of how loud it is, yes it isn't as loud or roomy or filling but it is more than satisfying. They now have two speakers so its a stereo sound. It is louder than my iPhone 5 and certainly more clear, catchy, bass adoring than I would image from an iPad. This was the surprise winner for me. A bit of a let down in terms of design is that if you're lying and watching a film in portrait mood the speaker sound may be muffled by your stomach/body part in contact with the base of the iPad air. The solution is LANDSCAPE mode. The two speakers are now located on the left and right side of the charging port. No complaints on this. The iPad 3 is maybe 30% as loud as the iPad air.3) Battery Life/Faster Charging Speed - I don't know why but I feel the iPad 3 had a longer battery when it was new. A new apple iPad will last you so long, it will need for you to bore it to death to bring it from 100% to 64%. Yes, this is the case with the new iPad but it isn't as good but overall the fact that charging time seems to have reduced by half is a big big big big winner for me. So overall, no complaints. I don't get 13-14 hours like I used to with my iPad 3. I get 11 hours. Yes, I make the best use of the new sound feature. The fact that it charges faster means I don't need to pull it out before 100% and this is a good thing for the battery. With the iPad 3, I have to wait for it to be 100% charged and it can take unto 8 hours. This has been reduced by almost half and I feel 4-5 hours will give you a 100%.4) Processor - The iOS 7 clearly stalls a bit on the iPad 3. Did I notice this before buying the iPad Air? Yes cause my iPhone 5 was faster than the iPad 3. If you're playing quiz up, everything loads in seconds, if you are browsing, it goes boom boom boom like my macbook air. Well nothing quite compares to browsning on the AIR but this is very good. iPad Air is the best device for youtube because of the loud speaker, I can sit with it for hours and discover various things. The processor seems to heat a lot less. There  is never a lag on anything. It doesnt think so much.5) Camera - Camera has improved from the iPad 3. Both the front and the back is more defined. Do I use this? Why wouldn't i?COULD HAVE BEEN BETTERS' WITH THIS IPAD AIR -1) Headphone Jack Placement/Volume Output -  This isn't as loud when using with headphones as the iPad 3 used to be. It is a more customised sound. The headphone jack is located at the same place where it used to be but because the surface area is smaller, I have found that when I am lying down and using my iPad AIR, the wires often get a bit entangled.2) The iPad Air still heats up. I can't for the life of me figure out why I pay a company so much money when they make a product that heats up on full brightness. This is one hell of an annoying feature.3) The back on the iPad Air, the volume buttons, the power button, the menu button - they all seem a bit too delicate in comparison with the iPad 3. This is just an intuition or impression but I can't help but feel it needs to be treated gently.4) Safari has been needing an overhaul for the longest and I feel they need a better browser than the one they have right now. It often freezes on my iPad 3. It should be perfect like iMessage is perfect, like FaceTime is close to perfect, like email is perfect, it isn't quite up there. I would give it a 6/10 in terms of potential.5) iBooks - I read on my iPad more than anything else but the iBooks software also needs some more options of backgrounds and schemes. Apple plays safe for far too long but they need to give more options to make READERS WANT TO READ MORE.6) Syncing iTunes is a bit confusing. There should be more education given to all customers about preferred type of WIFI networks, sometimes applications don't update, I have no idea why they are doing this. I have to go to airplane mode and then go back up. The iCloud feature needs 10GB and Apple need to stop being a cheapskate.Conclusion  -Get the iPad Air if you are looking for something with good design quality, good battery, an extra lightning cable (half joke) , something faster, smoother...this is about a 31% improvement over the iPad 3. Thats a big deal.Of my iPhone, macbook Air, iPad Air - I have always liked the iPads the most. They have reliable battery and never ever ever die on you like the other two. Its that simple and that keen.If they take into account some of the things I didn't like about this product, Apple can be made better overall.

I got it the day it came out in stores. It starts with the ultra-sharp exterior. If you loved last year's iPad Mini, you'll feel right at home with the Air. Apple essentially built a larger version of the Mini with the Air, by slimming the beveling of previous iPads to achieve a sleeker framework.The lack of heft makes the Air just a little more comfortable: An LTE-equipped Air weighs all of 1.05 pounds. Wrapped in a comfy and protective Apple Smart Case, the Air weighs 1.368 pounds, still lighter than a third-generation iPad by itself. Despite the lack of size, the Air is no less tough. It's sturdy and not at all easy to bend.The Air feels that much more like an electronic magazine. The Retina display, once the standard for all screens but also facing more competition this year, helps that; reading text and viewing web pages on that crystal-clear, pixel-dense screen is the same joy it was when Apple first built Retina screens into its tablets early last year.If this is all Apple did, it would likely still be enough to keep it on top. But the iPad Air does far more, starting with the new processor powering the entire experience, the A7. The same dual-core, 64-bit A7 chip that debuted in the iPhone 5S is in the iPad Air; and initially, this seems like a disappointment. In theory, you expect something more in Apple's flagship tablet, something a bit more powerful, with perhaps more graphical horsepower.In practice, you won't notice a thing. Web browsing and apps still handle as snappily as ever, even if you have a gaggle of things running in the background. Top-tier games such as Infinity Blade 3 continue to deliver. A pleasant surprise is also how quickly some of the beefier games, such as Anomaly 2, loaded, compared to previous iPads. You'll move into and out of levels just a little bit more swiftly, and that helps make the entire gaming experience more friendly and natural. It's hard to know what this really means for Apple gaming, but don't rule out the possibility of more console titles being ported to the iPad.Apple realizes the limitations of the 64 GB storage too, offering a new 128-gig model. You'll pay a more-than-average-laptop premium here ($799 for the WiFi-only model and $929 for an LTE version), but the improved storage is intriguing, especially for those planning for a game-heavy future. I can now easily and comfortably load all the music and movies onto the iPad Air that I want and still have plenty of room left over for games such as XCOM: Enemy Unknown and Civilization: Revolutions.Battery life is steady, even if it's not mind-blowing. Apple claims the iPad Air can get you 10 hours on a charge, and that's definitely true. Even when using Apple's navigation for a long trip to Washington, I easily got through a day without needing to charge; and more casual usage, such as Web browsing and email checks, is no problem.The Air's lone shortcoming is that it lacks the fingerprint identification technology that debuted on the iPhone 5S. But I'd be hard-pressed to claim that this was some glaring omission; every other tablet you're going to use this year lacks such tech, and I've never seen that tech as an absolute must-have.The resulting tablet is as pleasant to use as they come, and it's backed by some consistently solid software. Android has made a tremendous run over the past few years, and a plethora of both Android and Windows Mobile devices are truly intriguing this holiday season. But if there's one consistent shortcoming on those devices, it's the up-and-down support of operating systems.It's hard to know whether this Android tab or that will support Google's latest OS, but that's almost never a problem with iPads. iOS releases are generally consistent and stable, the lone knock on Apple being its lack of Android-like customization.And while the Apps Store and iTunes are also battling competition from Microsoft's stores and Google's Marketplace, Apple's setup continues to set the bar, managing to be intuitive and easy to use and enjoying more and more high-profile digital releases.", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love It!", "Author": "Amy Leftis", "ReviewID": "R9JQAS7K7K0PK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Much faster than the original ipad.

Navigation is way different.BTW. If you are running on battery only and don't need location services, shut it off. Its a huge battery sucker.BTW#2: I almost bought a longer charge cable for this (newer lightning connect style) since the one that comes with it 4' is too short for the real world. Instead I spent $3.00 for a 6' USB extension cord to extend between the charge module and lightning cord. It works fine and will keep the battery at 100%  while I am working. IF location service is not activated.One gripe about the AIR seems to be reduced battery life. Shut off the services and features you don't need on all the time.(UPDATE 5/5/14)Been using the #5 air for over a month now... I LOVE IT! Theres a little learning curve moving up from iOS 5 to 7+, not an issue. I had no problem moving my \"stuff\" including apps, to the new iPad.... The finti cover, is sweet, too! Recommended!Next on line is an iPad mini (soon) and I'll elaborate a bit....I use a verizon mifi modem with my pads when I travel. (converts cell-wireless to wifi) Internet/email anywhere. Works great. In doing this, I have scrapped my cell phone and installed skype phone on my iPads... Flawless voip service, full feature with dedicated phone #... All for $6.00 a month a $.o2 a minute pay as I go. Compare that to the cost of a smartphone with data package! So saying, a mini will fit in my pocket as a large smartphone and serve all my needs on the road...

He loved it so much that we got one for him. We bought the Apple cases for both of them and my husband bought the stylus, as well.We  are both very pleased with these tablets. My husband has a neurological condition and the accessibility features and stylus have been wonderful for him. He stopped using his laptop for portability, because the iPad Air does everything he wants. We were afraid it would be too heavy for him to hold, but he has found it to be lightweight and comfortable, and it does weigh less than earlier iPads. Anyone with vision and fine motor skills problems is almost certain to love the iPad Air, especially when combined with the stylus.I dropped my iPad twice when in parking lots, both times from low heights, but on hard surfaces. The case protected it and I have had no problems resulting from the drops.We use our iPad Airs primarily for reading Kindle books. Our joint account has a huge archive and our other devices were not handling it. The K4iPad app and this unit work beautifully together and we have had no problems accessing our books. This iPad is powerful.We were worried about how comfortable it would be to read for long periods because we kept hearing that tablet screens bothered one's eyes. We found it easy to use the settings to adjust the screen lighting, and found an adjustment that has caused no eye problems, even when reading for several hours. It has been very comfortable. We have also read in fairly bright sun with no problems. However, when the sun was actually hitting the screen, it was impossible to read on it.We do use the iPad Air for many other functions. Games, surfing the web, eMail, videos, music, photos, YouTube, social networking sites, and so on, work as well as on a computer. The battery lasts a long time and the 3G is a real bonus when wi-fi is not available.I have seen some negative reviews of the iPad Air, and I don't doubt that some people have had bad experiences. All I can say is that we have had good experiences with Apple. Our iMac was out of warranty and still working when Apple notified us they were replacing the hard drive on all iMacs like ours, because the hard drives had an unacceptable failure rate. When we took it in to the Apple store, I asked them to also check my iPod Touch, which was two years out of warranty and had become very temperamental and glitchy. They found a corrupted file on the iPod Touch and got it set up and working for me, and didn't charge anything.  We have had good experiences with the iPad Air and are extremely happy with both of ours.", "Date": "June 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Wonderful", "Author": "Brad Potts", "ReviewID": "R1IOW55MJ0WJHD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a ergonomic, user friendly, electronic media formate for the casual user.

The total length of the lightning cable is approximately 3.25 feet. Being used to longer cables, I've accidentally yanked this thing a few times but that hasn't done anything to my iPad Air... yet. However, you can probably purchase a longer lightning cable online.Also, I found the rate that the iPad downloads apps is about 5x slower than even an iPhone 4. Apple support told me this is usually because newer devices have a lot more to do like connecting to iCloud for the first time, etc, but I don't buy it. I think it's just because iPad apps are a lot larger than iPhone so I don't expect this to change, but I'll update if it gets any faster. UPDATE: Yes, my iPad does download at fast speeds now after one day, so don't worry if you encounter the same issue at first!While these two points are on the negative side, keep in mind that my overall experience is easily still 5 stars.

Even now, I get annoyed at some Apple-isms, the way Apple does some things, and try to stay away from it for the most part.  But I do believe it's typically more stable than it's technological counterparts, and easier to use for newbies.  Which is why we bought an IPAD 2 for our 8 yr old a couple years ago.  He took to it right away, it's intuitive enough.  There have been some slight issues, but it's still going strong.  Now 10, we just bought him this IPAD AIR... his 2 yr old brother gets the \"old\" IPAD 2.  And yes, the IPAD is intuitive enough for even a 2 yr old!  The screen on the AIR is so much better, clearer, sharper, and not just because it's \"new\".  Its resolution is just that much better.  Bought a cheap full body case until I could find a better one... trying to decide between the Otterbox (love the protection, not so much the hard cover design and that it doubles as a stand)... the Griffin Survivor (flimsy stand, landscape mode only)... or the Pelican Vault (no integrated screen protector, but I can put a protector on, and it is rated against water splash)... Lifeproof too expensive for what it offers... The 16G in the IPAD 2 was ultimately not enough after a year or so of use... Even with no \"movies\" or \"music\", games are much larger now, a few big games, and there is little left in a 16G device.  Without removing games, we didn't have enough memory left to upgrade the OS... so we opted for 64G this time... Though not an Apple fan, my 2 sons love them, I seldom have to \"fix\" anything with them, and so I rate it 5-stars!", "Date": "May 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "very happy", "Author": "charles a. winthrop", "ReviewID": "R20V3OWBNO61S9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "my wife loves it she likes it more than her ipad one.

First off, Safari crashes ALL THE TIME. I've only had one or two crashes on my old iPad so this took some getting used to. Secondly, there is the \"white screen of death\" where the iPad will just reboot itself for no apparent reason. Again, Apple products just don't behave this way so this was a huge disappointment. Finally, it is long past time that iOS add a real file system for saving files and sharing them between apps.

I've found that to be untrue. My Kindle Fire HDX screen is MUCH better--it seems to be a harder, slicker surface, so fingerprints and such don't stick to the screen. Putting the Tech Armor screen protector on the iPad helps. 2) The app store is filled with a lot of junk, and there are so many apps there that it takes a lot of time to wade through to something that actually looks useful. Many of the apps are almost duplicates of each other. On the plus side, and the reason I got the iPad in the first place, there are some apps that are written only for the iPad.Second, the positive: this thing is a true battery miser. I can go a couple of days between charges, more if I'm not using it heavily.

Performance wise I do a lot of multi tasking and it doesn't even break a sweat. The picture is brilliant very clear and crisp. The size and structure are amazing light and beautiful very sharp. It fits in your hands like a glove. It has a great camera for a tablet you wouldn't believe the pictures I have taken with this thing I get a lot if compliments all the time. As for its competitors the samsung note 10.1 2014 edition, the structure of this ipad blows it away. Know Samsung has its own perks that Apple doesn't offer but I would still say its a fair superior product then the note. That being said I do own a galaxy s4 smart phone and I absolutely love it I just prefer my phone to have a bigger screen,and it has it's other perks as well. mainly the galaxy gear watch sealed the deal for me.

The Apple store manager then advised me to return the iPad because not only did I not receive the model invoiced but also that if I had any problems with it I would not get any warranty service because warranties are not offered for Mexican sold Apple products.Otherwise, this is the best tablet I have ever used.

It was also nice having it on the long flights....between looking at my photos and playing all the games I have loaded into it, the time just flew by!  Of course, there are many other reasons to love the iPad, but for me, being able to view and edit photos while away from home is priceless.

Google it first with \"How do you transfer multiple folders to iPad?\" and read what others have said.

The hardest choice.", "Author": "Mumbly Joe \"MumblyJoe\"", "ReviewID": "R1EP8MRB01CCTV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A lot of people have already talked about the merits of this device and the pros and cons. For me the decision wasn't so much which to buy but rather which one I wanted. Originally I got the mini to replace my kindle touch because of the price and the pocketable size. Ultimately I ended up with the air. Here's why:Grip: despite the very comfortable dimensions for 1 handed holding of the mini the extra thin bezel proved problematic. The palm rejection tech is supposed to be quite good but I found it unreliable and for those times I wanted to gets.  Eventually I always wanted to get a hold of it with  the bezel between my thumb and forefinger but either ended up with a thumb right in the middle of whatever I was watching or a hand cramp.Real estate: getting smaller means text is smaller especially on we pages In portrait mode. You can set the text size up for dynamic type but it doesn't work everywhere and when if does work and you change to landscape, then the text is far too big for the screen. Furthermore, in games where part of the screen is used for the controls I ended up wishing for a larger screen.Keyboard: the keyboard ended up being the main reason I went for the Air. While it is surprisingly good on the mini (really it blew me away how good the keyboard was in the mini) typing at that size for any extended period is taxing and it just can't compete with the Air if you plan on writing any amount. Furthermore, using the GarageBand keyboards are fairly awkward on the smaller screen. Unlike the accessory keyboards for the full size iPads, I found the external keyboards for the mini were actually much much worse than the onscreen keyboard.Pocketability: the mini fit quite nicely into a jacket pocket, in the climate where I live jackets are only really feasible about 3 or 4 months out of the year. Other than that it needs bag of some sort, which is really the same situation I'd be in with an Air.Weight: this made the choice the hardest. Holding the iPad mini feels like hardly anything at all. The iPad air feels considerably heavier. That affects everything you do with the tablet and the entire interaction with it. Fortunately it's mostly a matter of perspective. Put down the mini for a day and all of a sudden the air seems  quite light.For me the decision was made for the larger version but what about options?Cellular of no cellular? The free 3G on my kindle touch has gotten me out of a scrape more than once and having access to a no-strings-attached internet connection is guaranteed to come in handy at least once during the lifetime of your tablet. $130 is a lot to spend though, especially if you have a smart phone and free tethering on your plan. Originally I went for the wifi version for precisely this reason. However, the ability to tether is dependent on the carrier you happen to be using. Should you switch phones, carriers or plans or simply lose the phone while traveling tethering May no longer be a option and it's never going to be as convenient as simply opening the settings on your iPad and activating a plan. In addition you also gain the ability to use gps with a cellular modem and gain the benefits of enhanced find my iPhone accuracy in the event that it's stolen and the thieves know enough to keep it off wifi. Finally though, the possibility of a free 200 mb per month with t-mobile and the ability to switch carriers at will ended up pushing me to get the cellular version.So, after having initially been interested by the mini, a lot  of research, even more indecision and having bought, lived with and sold multiple versions of this thing I can safely say that the iPad Air with cellular is the  version I'd pick. If you don't plan on typing a lot with it though or watching movies, go for the mini.", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "First Ever Apple Product - First Ever iPad - LOVE IT", "Author": "JoHarley", "ReviewID": "R1X2GEOQACNWD2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The has become a great tool for my photography needs.

Others about the brightness...indeed I do have it cranked all the way up but the brightness is nowhere as bright as what is found on the Samsung Note 10.1 2014 edition, nor the iPad4 and my most recent purchase the Samsung Note 8. All 3 when cranked all the way up are much brighter than the iPad Air.I will be buying the new Google nexus 7(even with all the GPS and multi-touch issues) for the upcoming holidays but even in the store, that too seems much brighter...I am very dismayed at this lack of brightness from the Air but it is still more than adequate for indoors. I have not tried it outdoors nor will I as this is not my \"outdoor\" tablet...lol.I like Apple and the tight integration of their apps and the reason many including myself continue to buy their products. I do feel the price for this latest iteration is them trying to make money at our expense. WHO HERE DOES NOT KNOW IN THEIR HEART THAT APPLE IS TRYING TO GET IN ON THE CHRISTMAS RUSH AND PUT THE AIR AND THE NEW MINI WITHOUT THE FINGERPRINT FEATURES FOUND ON THE NEW IPHONE...COME MARCH MAYBE APRIL, APPLE WILL UPDATE THE IPAD AIR TO INCLUDE THAT FEATURE.I will continue to buy Apple mostly because their store has apps that are better, with more choices and work extremely well with their devices. I think this product is a 3 1/2 Stars at best and mostly for the size and weight reduction that is very significant. I feel the \"glass\" is too thin but seems to be durable as I have really been typing a lot on it as well as playing several games that require a lot of tapping. I am very happy with the size reduction but feel the brightness is not up to par with other new tablets or the iPad4.Recently the Safari browser has been \"crashing\" a lot over the past week in that when you tap on a hyperlink, the browser will basically disappear off the screen. None of the tabs close but it just disappears and returns you to the home screens. I also am finding the browser will get stuck/freeze for several minutes before resuming. I have several calls in with apple support and they are looking into the issues.Other issues is the VIDEO app, if you play a video via streaming not downloading and leave it somewhere like the middle or so on, it actually reduces your available memory by the amount you have watched from what I can glean. IT IS LIKE DOWNLOADING THE MOVIE TO THE POINT YOU HAVE WATCHED IT TO EVEN THOUGH YOU SELECTED THE STREAMING LINK. If you do this with several movies, you can basically wipe out your free memory. I find it difficult to clear the buffer and have basically learned to tell the app not to display any movies then to display movies then play the movie but move the slider to the beginning and press stop playing then done. Of these many steps I eventually clear the buffer but I am not sure which of all these steps actually is what does it if any!Oh lastly, the WI-fi is fantastic.FINAL RATING IS 3 1/2 STARS...MAYBE 4 IF NOT FOR THE BRIGHTNESS ISSUE.First I own iPad 2 and 4 and Samsung Note 10.1 2014 edition.I like...not love...the new iPad Air as it is faster both in operating the software apps and graphic intensive apps. The apps continue to be fantastic for all the pads not just the Air.Apple did a great job on the weight but FEEL STRONGLY THAT THE NEW SCREEN IS NOT NEARLY AS BRIGHT AS MY iPad 4 NOR DOES IT EVEN FEEL LIKE GLASS.As I type this review on the Air, the \"cheap tapping\" feel of this glass leaves me wondering how durable this glass is. It feels thin and makes a tapping sound not found on the more solid glass on my other two iPads.Oh I am keeping the Air for the faster processors but feel Apple has put out a product whose screen will not be as durable as prior pads.I can see it flex when I push down on it with minimal effort and have some light distortion when I press down like old type LED TVS.Apple over prices their products because they can and really did so on this iteration of their iPad. In my estimation the glass feels like plastic and the brightness is much diminished when compared to my iPad 4 and so must have a higher profit margin with all these cost cutting that resulted in a new iPad that for all practically purposes is just faster but not as solidly built as prior pads.Time will tell on the screen and maybe this is the way all tablets are headed to achieve the weight reduction and thinness. I love the ability to hold the Air in one hand comfortably for much longer than any of my current tablets. I am OK to sacrifice the glass quality as long as the touch screen does not suffer or long term screen reliability.I wish Apple would splurge and include a 6 foot charging cord...OMG $600 for 32GB and the cord is so short still after all this time...lol.", "Date": "November 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "They Sent me a used iPad......WTF????", "Author": "Marcus Scott-Morgan", "ReviewID": "RUZ0K3ME024YE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I cant believe these guys had the nerve to send me an iPad air with no factory seal around the unit.I then proceeded to charge the iPad for the first time.

Apple keeps getting so close, in some ways, yet so far away in others. Please let me explain.First, an iPad is overall a great piece of hardware. The iPad Air is lighter, thinner, and faster than all other tablet devices on the market. However, it does come with a few issues that leaves me hesitant to give more than a rating of 3 stars. Please let me explain.First off, Apple is notorious of fleecing every penny you have out of you. It isn't just the brand name or the product quality.For those that remember the days when buying a Nintendo Entertainment System (NES for short), what did you get in that box? You got the connector cable to the TV, you got not just one but two controllers, a light zapper gun (Duck Hunt anyone?), and up to three games that came included all in one box.What does Apple doe? Let's see. You have to buy a screen protector (separately) a protecting case (separately) connectors to a TV (separately) a stylus (separately), etc. etc. even if you get a good Black Friday deal somewhere, you can end up almost spending the same or more of a cost on a used car versus the cost of the iPad with all the extras you end up being required to buy on your own. You also get another additional $99.00 charge for a very limited (basically only a 1 time only use) AppleCare warranty plan.Also, there is the hardware. I know Apple is known to hold back a bit and choose stable hardware versus the latest greatest things out there. I get that. However, there are a number of areas Apple slacked on A LOT on the iPad Air.1. It still uses a USB 2.0 connection over a connection to your PC. Even if your PC has a USB 3.0 port, the iPad Air still only transfers data at USB 2.0 speed (a snail's pace by comparison).2. The battery in the iPad Air is actually half the size of the battery in the iPad 4. Despite claims of optimizations and so-on, Apple has still refused to spend some of the billions they earn each year on actual real research and development on a longer lasting battery with a much longer amount of juice. You shouldn't have to run to the nearest plug-in jack every few feet to recharge the thing. Likewise, am I the only one that realizes that solar charger calculators have existed since the 70's? If Apple would simply put a slightly larger sized battery inside the iPad, with a solar charger built into the case itself, no one would ever need to plug it in again to recharge it. As how very dated solar chargers are for small electronics, there is no excuse for not having it.3. The iPad was recently boosted in storage capacity from the former max 64GB to the current 128GB model. I do appreciate that. What I don't appreciate it just how many years the 64GB max storage model existed and how many years it took Apple to raise storage capacity. As fast as technology advances, we should have at least 512GB or even 1TB storage on an iPad. Consider that desktop PCs can have a 6 to 8 and soon to be 10TB storage capacity, a minor 512GB or 1 single TB of storage space should be no issue for Apple to provide, especially since Apple still offers no micro-SD slot for adding more storage capacity.Finally, I will say, I find it very inconsiderate, rude, and showing true colors on just how far Apple is in bed with Obama, the White House, the police state, and the National Security Agency (NSA). Just look up the Part 2 of Infect and Protect video by Jacob Appelbaum. About half-way through the video, he shows with official NSA slides that proves they have a 100% chance to be able to turn on any Apple device, i.e. iPad, IPhone, etc. They can turn on the microphone when you are not using it, they can also activate the camera to take photos of you, all with everyone around being left completely unaware. They have full access to your contact lists, including the complete addresses and phone numbers of all of your contacts, have access to all of your passwords, all of your email, all of your Google searches, and much more. Unfortunately, Apple decided to give in and join the PRISM program after Steve Jobs died. When that happened, any possible minor chance of any privacy, freedom, or liberty any owner of any Apple iDevice had, went right out the window. Could Apple have done their part to protect its customers? Yes, and very easily. The could have chosen to encrypt all user information and data stored at Apple and in the iCLoud. They could have been respectable and NOT give the FBI, CIA, NSA, or anyone else 100% universal backdoor access keys of their customer's devices. They could have added a completely free open-source plug-in offered by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) called HTTPS-Everywhere into Safari on iDevices, preventing web traffic from being intercepted, by using a SSL connection everywhere, instead of use the very unsafe standard HTTP connection on the web. They could built into iOS a 2 form of authentication, instead of just a small 4 character password. They could have built access directly to the Tor network for full free anonymity. Apple did none of this, and it would have costed the very little in time and resources to implement. Until Apple grows up and starts fighting for the privacy, liberty, and freedom on their customers, I cannot in good faith suggest anyone buy an Apple Product again.", "Date": "April 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice increase in speed,", "Author": "Mike60", "ReviewID": "R1QHQO5QBVHQFP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "light and fast, easy too hold, screen is very nice.

No problems with my wife's iPad2.  I've tried several sounds to announce an email, and when I tried the duck quack I can never change it or shut is off. It's so annoying I quit watching Duck Dynasty! Also, when an email arrives you have to scroll to the most recent, it doesn't do it automatically. The worst problem was ignoring my touches, even though the icon would highlight, indicating it recognized my touch. However, when I did the software update a few days ago the touch problem went away and always recognizes my touch.The biggest issue is once you build your life around one of these monsters it has you for the rest of your life. You cannot live with out it. Carrying mine to a hardware dealer 55 miles away to use a coupon that wouldn't print out saved me $70, as it was still on the screen at the check stand. If left on all night in the sleep mode it only uses about 1% of the battery charge.A couple days ago  I stumbled into an iPad chat and some guru suggested doing a \"reset\" to cure the locked on duck quack, that did the trick. I also saw I wasn't alone with this problem.

Hopefully in 2014 the next iPad Air model will put the S T E R E O speakers on the FRONT of the device.UPDATE 12/4/2013: I just came back from The Apple Store to make it \"official\" that I have used an iPad Air.  Yes the iPad Air is thinner than previous iPad models and it may be faster.  Honestly I didn't see much of a difference in speed between the iPad Air and the iPad 4 while surfing the web.  That said I still see no reason to get an iPad Air if you already own an iPad 4.", "Date": "November 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "I Really, Really Wanted To Like The iPad Air", "Author": "MARCIA", "ReviewID": "R2UL04RH6CL3X1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I really, really wanted to like the iPad Air, but It just wasn't for me. I was looking for a replacement for my 2008 white Macbook, which I loved. The iPad Air is NOT, repeat not a laptop replacement. I don't have heavy computing requirements, but the brand new iPad couldn't do a number of BASIC things my 5 and a half year old Macbook does with ease.The most important is multitasking. The iPad can only do one thing at a time. Only one window or app can be open at a time. Seriously? iPad doesn't do flash player, so any number of things (like watching certain youtube videos,etc) can't be done.I found the touch screen to be inconsistent. I was constantly having to enlarge links to be able to click them properly. I was also disappointed with the small amount of included apps.Now the good: If you want a portable device to check email, browse the web, take pictures,etc and you tend to do one thing at a time, the iPad may work for you. The retina display and the fit and finish of the iPad are excellent. It is light, thin, fast, and beautiful. Siri is included and works well.I love Apple products, but I found the iPad to be underpowered and lacking versatility. If you're looking for a laptop replacement, I couldn't recommend it. I ended up returning it and got a Macbook Pro instead.", "Date": "December 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "I want to give zero if I could!", "Author": "Hao Wang", "ReviewID": "RC2HQ6Q43B1F4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "How can they get the permission of selling on Amazon?!
