{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Wow, well worth the money!", "Author": "Chris in Phoenix", "ReviewID": "R3HNT9UGAUK35T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have several Android devices - phones and other tablets. I wanted a tablet for my daughter for Christmas; she is 8, and very tablet savvy (they use them at school, and also she uses mine). The pink case sold me on it, and the price (< $80 delivered). However, I was skeptical of the cost, and how functional it would really be.First off, it shipped very fast by USPS. It arrived within a few days. It was pristine. Along with the tablet was a screen protector, USB cable, charger, USB type-A adapter (which I assume is to connect USB devices such as flash drives and *maybe* keyboard - I plan to test both of these later today), earbud headphones and a decent (although unnecessary) stylus. Initially, I thought the screen was scratched, and not very responsive, but there is a protective plastic cover over it. Take that off, and put the screen protector on instead and it looks and works great. The capacitive touch is very good, especially considering the price.It has decent performance. It came right up on my office network, and worked flawlessly. Netflix streamed very smoothly. Video playback from Netflix and MP4 files I copied from my PC worked great. Audio playback was reasonable for a tablet, and sounded very good with headphones. Sound through the speaker with video and audio playback was fine (plenty loud). Skype worked fine also, as did various games I tried (Angry Birds and Fruit Ninja come installed). The Android app store came right up, and I had no problem downloading apps and music.By default, the tablet comes in USB storage device mode, which did not work with Windows 7 x64. Not sure why. I switched the tablet to Media Device mode and was able to copy photos, music and video to it with no issues. The popup keyboard worked fine; no issues. Typing emails and texts works great; it synced right up to my Gmail account no problem.Overall, I am very impressed. This is well worth the money. The display is nice, and very readable. The battery seems comparable to my wife's Nook Color. With a bit of tweaking, this could be a fantastic tablet for anyone. Well worth the money. In fact, I am amazed at the price. I highly recommend.MORE INFO - NEXT DAYSome additional info for those considering this tablet. The USB port is a micro USB, same as what you find on most Android smart phones and tablets. It uses the same cable and charger as my Motorola RAZR MAXX and my wife's DROID X2. Also, it appears to support OTG (on-the-go) USB. It will connect to a PC to transfer files (photos, documents, videos, etc.) and will also connect to a USB flash drive. Inside the box is a Type-A USB adapter cable. You connect your USB flash drive to it, then connect to the Zeepad and open the Android file manager (see photos). Also, I connected a USB keyboard this morning in the same way (via the Type-A adapter) and that worked, too. I was able to type/edit a letter, and type an email. No app was required for the keyboard, it was immediately recognized.I have tested Netflix, Skype, video playback, music playback, Angry Birds, Fruit Ninja, Temple Run, Pinball Deluxe, Hulu Plus, Lookout (anti-virus/malware app), Dolphin Web browser, Google Play, Gmail, and Kindle app (and store) and it all works great. No complaints. I've tested WiFi in three places, including home an office, and it was flawless and fast. The SD flash card slot is a MicroSD, not the standard SD card you find in most digital cameras. The MicroSD is very common on smart phones and tablets. The Zeepad 7 looks to support 16 GB cards with no issues.Android System App says the OS is 4.0.4 (Ice Cream Sandwich). Kernel build is 3.0.8+. Internal storage shows max 1008 MB for downloaded apps + 1636 MB for app data, and photos/videos/music transferred from your PC. Max RAM is 353 MB. Everything else is tied up by the OS. Adding an 8 GB or 16 GB MicroSD card would be best for storing music, photos and videos, and off-loading some apps and app data (that support off-loading to removable flash, not all do). The battery is reported as being a LiFe battery, which is lithium-iron-phosphate (LiFePO4). If true, that's impressive. LiFe is a high performance and capacity technology with a long cycle life (up to 2000 cycles, or 3-4 times that of lithium-ion). Such batteries are extremely safe; they will not explode or catch fire if over-charged or short-circuited. They can also be charged very rapidly, and can last 5+ years. So, if I can trust what the Android System App is telling me, I'm impressed. The display is 800 x 432, 60 Hz refresh, with a 160 dpi display density. It is very readable, and bright. I am running mine at 40% brightness. The CPU shows as being an ARM v7 running at 1008 MHz. The clock rate is variable; it will range between 60 and 1008 MHz automatically to reduce power drain - the OS does this automatically.Some things it does not have: obviously, no mobile networking support, only WiFi. So, you need to be in a WiFi hotspot to access the Internet (which is getting easier and easier in so many public places). There is no GPS. There is no rear-facing camera for taking photos, just the front facing camera for making video calls (that seems like an oversight to me, because a 5MP phone camera would be cheap to add). There is no Bluetooth, and no way to add it. None of these things are show-stoppers in my opinion for a $70 tablet, but would be nice if tablet designers could make some of this stuff available as modular user upgrades.Bottom line - this tablet is worth the price. Best $70 I've spent in a while.", "Date": "December 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Starter Tablet", "Author": "Lishai", "ReviewID": "R17OA01F0IUGOT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased product for my kids and I love it. My husband and I have the Samsung Galaxy 10.1 so we were looking for something very similar but smaller for the kids. This is the closest by far to the high end tablets for a great price. I love how it runs off the play store, many we have looked at were Android but they ran off of the \"get jar\" market and didn't have much like the play store does. I recommend this product to everyone looking for and affordable tablet.", "Date": "November 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Great Value. Glad I found it.", "Author": "lj", "ReviewID": "RC3E67V4P6KGW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "***UPDATED*** 11/18/13I promised I would update this review as time went on. This tablet has officially died. It will not turn on or charge no matter what I try.I still stand by my earlier statements that this is a good \"value\" purchase and/or entry tablet for young kids. Although you would expect things to last more than a year. I haven't looked into what the warranty is but I'm sure we're past it. It has served its purpose for us and I will be buying a better tablet later on to replace this one.If you know your expectations and you want a tablet that is cheap for young kids who may be rough on them, I recommend this tablet as long as you are not expecting more than a year and can deal with the issues I listed below.Otherwise, I would officially change my recommendation to a \"Do not buy,\" or Buyer beware. If you are looking for a Nexus/Galaxy/iPad type experience, keep looking.***UPDATED*** See below original review***I just bought this for my son for Christmas and it came in the mail today. It has an expandable micro sd card slot (TF)and most people will probably need it. (Keep reading) I bought this one: SanDisk microSDHC 8GB Class 2 Card with SD Adapter (SDSDQ-8192). I've always found Sandisk to be pretty reliable. The onboard memory states 4 gb but the available memory was about 1gb so keep that in mind if it's important to you. Memory cards are dirt cheap and can easily get you where you want cheaper than going the \"other\" route.I took the pad out to play with it some. It comes installed with Angry Birds, Netflix, Facebook, Fruit Ninja, Play Store, Adobe flash player and of course your regular items (wallpaper, camera, clock widget, browser, wifi, etc.)Some have said the packaging had a knockoff look. A better choice of words would be that it has \"generic\" packaging. It's not a ripoff or knockoff which connotes images of backstreet deals from some guys trunk. That's not a fair assessment of this product. The instruction booklet is admittedly small but who needs an instruction booklet to run a tablet?My only concerns are that it withstands the test of time and the 10 year old. It seems well built. (One minor design flaw is the screen and the outer frame aren't flush with each other so there is a gap. It will definitely collect dirt and be hard to get out.) Not a deciding factor but I can see it getting on my OCD nerves. The camera is also average at best but I never understood why people needed a great camera for a tablet. (Is a tablet really going to be your go to camera for things like vacation?)We bought this for our 10 yr old son. As such I think it's important for people to understand what this tablet competes with. It would be a mistake to compare this to the iPad for both good and bad reasons.It isn't in competition with the iPad but rather the iPod touch. We went with this instead of the iTouch and saved a lot of $. It was $69 for a 4gb Android tablet (expandable to 32) vs. $199 for a 16gb iTouch (not expandable.)I think we made the right choice and I think he will like it. Good luck everyone. Be smart.I will update this review after Christmas when the tablet sees regular daily use.****UPDATE***It's always good to come back and reevaluate a product after the newness has worn off and you can think more objectively. My overall feeling on the tablet hasn't changed much. I would still recommend it to the target audience that I mentioned above. Again, if you are looking for a backup to your laptop or an alternative to an iPad, this probably isn't for you. But for those who have read the description and know what you're getting, this will still be a great product.Here are my impressions over the past week of regular use:Screen: I start with the screen because at first I was turned off by the screen. It is more of a durable plastic. However when I go to my Galaxy tablet and come back to it I am glad for the build and glad that my kids have the Zeepad. It's perfect for them.As such you should know though that it will probably show marks. I'm fine with that. After all it comes with a stylus. The screen protector that comes with it is lacking and we have been looking (unsuccessfully for some that will fit it). Screen protectors for a 7\" tablet Do NOT fit the Zeepad. It is slightly smaller than 7\" so keep that in mind. Also finding a case has been a bit challenging. Universal cases that hold the corners cause it rub against the power button (which may be a design flaw). Nevertheless none of these things would cause me to fret.While I am glad that the screen is durable, others may be turned off of it if they are used to the high glossy, colorful screens. The Zeepad will look dull in comparison but again who are you buying it for?One other issue that has given me pause is the wifi. It works great but it can be quirky at times. One time it was turned off and after selecting on it would immediately turn off again. It would continue to do this until we finally shut it down. After a little while it worked fine. Maybe this was a one time thing. It happens. Also the clock constantly reverts itself to January 1, 1970. I don't know the significance of that date (LOL) but I finally solved this by checking the setting to sync the clock with the network when connected to wifi. Again, maybe this is an isolated event.The battery: I would take off a 1/2 star for the screen build and another 1/2 star for the battery. It definitely doesn't seem to last long but kids do forget to charge things. If you travel a lot this could be an issue for you. You might get a converter to get around this. (Finding a car charger might be difficult. The AC power cord is of the small, round variety.)One last thing: the memory. I said in my original review that the memory issue (comes stock with around 1GB available) could be worked around with a memory card. That is still technically true but in reality it has proven a little more difficult to run apps solely from the memory card. This could be an Android limitation as I am still new to the Android ecosystem. There is an app called App to SD which has made it a little more simpler but I am still not sure that it frees much space on the tablet. There are simply some games that you won't be able to play on this tablet. (So far it seems to be the racing games: Need for Speed, Asphalt, etc.) These use a lot of memory.While it may seem that I have changed my mind on this tablet because of these comments, in reality I haven't. I still consider it a good purchase and the proof of that is the recipient still enjoys it and loves it. However I wanted to be thorough for those who were still thinking of purchasing. All things considered I would still rate this a solid 4 star product and worth the risk if you understand who the target audience is and should be and also temper your expectations in regards to other similar products.PS - Just FYI. A lot of people are leaving negative reviews on this product because of shipping issues. Please read the reviews and find out if this product is for you. I am sad that others had shipping problems. Ours arrived in good time, from West coast to East coast during Christmas rush. Research the seller. There are probably some drop shippers used by Amazon that have nothing to do with the company that makes them. I have seen 2 or 3 different sellers to these.Hope this helps.**BATTERY UPDATE**Some users have experienced issues with the battery. I have monitored this with my son and we have come to the conclusion that the battery life is approximately 2-3 hours. It seems to be about 2.5 hours on average. This is basically Minecraft (which is all he plays) and nothing else. We have monitored it with low power usage apps and received about the same results. In short, you would be fortunate to get over 3 assuming all tablets are the same and this is the norm for these batteries.There was also an issue with the charger. It sometimes prefers certain outlets. Some outlets won't charge it correctly. I am assuming this is an adapter issue since we live in the USA. The adapter seems generic and I am currently trying to find a backup just in case.This still doesn't change much from my initial review but I wanted to keep the review updated. I always appreciated it when people would continue to be open minded toward their products and let others know how it was going.The battery issue may be disappointing to some but as I said above, it really all depends on who you're buying it for. My son has learned to work around it by keeping it charged and in all honesty kids need limits anyway. Long car trips could pose a problem but a converter would do the trick.", "Date": "December 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Buyer Beware - This is a worse than bad SCAM", "Author": "Always Already \"Avid Reader\"", "ReviewID": "R2A9TL4NZY9ZAX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "How can something be worse than bad you might ask. I ordered this product on Jan 24, 2013 from Amazon. I was told it would be shipped from China and I could expect a longer delivery time.  It finally arrived on Feb 26. The tablet did turn on but could NOT be charged.  I was told by Amazon that I would have to contact the seller.  The seller responded that I would have to ship the item back to China at my expense which I did ship it back and kept my proof of mailing and it cost another $30.96.  I shipped it back on March 1, 2013.  It is now May 1, 2013 and the seller via email keeps telling me they will refund my money (less $30.96) \"as soon as they receive the item\".  Well, guess what? After 60 days I do not believe they will ever receive the item.So this is how it can be worse than bad.  Amazon will do nothing and the seller will do nothing and I have lost my original purchase price plus another $30.96 so that I might be able to participate in this scheme.  The seller is better off sending crappy product that gets returned.  He is out nothing.

But I'm certainly glad I took the risk. Considering I wanted this device mostly as an e-reader, the tablet would be worth the price even if all it i did was respond to touch and read PDF's. But it does a lot more. The right thing to do is to not have high expectations. I mean, after all, it's incredibly inexpensive. But I am honestly surprised as to how functional this tablet is.I'll start by listing the cons to get them out the way:-Ports and jacks quality: poor(Some of the physical ports, like the AC and micro USB may not align perfectly. You may need to push hard.)-UI virtual movement response: seldom slight lag.(The UI response lag is slightly noticeable at times, but not significant. Most of the time it responds very well, you have to be very picky to care for a few hundred milliseconds)-Bluetooth: None-Technical Support: Poor/Non-existentNow for the Pros:-Android 4.0 : Excellent OS & UI-Rooted!: Root access enabled(You'll be able to install apps that require root access)-Graphic processing: Impressive(I was able to play Raging Thunder 2, Angry birds Starwars, and some other demanding games without any lag)-G-Sensor: Yes-Display and touch response: Good(The display is much better than others have described it. The touch response is on point)-Micro USB OTG: Allows you to plugin many common USB devices (have tried Flash drives, Mice, Keyboards)-Included Bonus: Ear buds, Micro USB to OTG cable, Screen protector(perfect fit), USB to PC cable, Tablet Pen.Other observations & comments:-The device comes with a proprietary charger, which I thought was kinda lame, until I discovered you can also charge the device using any Micro-USB charger (Recommended use: 5v - 2A).-No micro HDMI (Oh well)-Google Voice recognition works great at a fair distance.-Running: ES File Explorer with LAN file management - Good, Android VNC client - Good, Fling - Good, Google Play - No limitations, SuperUser - Good, ConnectBot - Good, AutoKiller - Good, Terminal Emulator - Good, Tasker - Limited.", "Date": "January 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "AWESOME affordable tablet", "Author": "A friendly helper", "ReviewID": "R2MQFNS4QOWYK6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is one of the best buys i have gotten.

I was pleasantly surprised though. This little tablet is very responsive, the build quality is pretty good, and it even has expandable memory (which my more expensive tablet does not). I bought this as a xmas gift for my girlfriend and overall I'm really happy with it. My only real gripe with it is the screen, but for the price I can't complain. There's no dead pixels or anything, you can kinda just tell the screen is cheap based on viewing angles and quality of images. It's really not that bad though and again, for $80 what do you expect. I especially like the size of this device. It's nice and compact and fits easily in my sweatshirt pocket but yet it's still big enough to where you can set it down and watch something on it.

It is not fancy, not top of the line. It has a low quality feel to it, however, do not be fooled. This is a very good tablet to do your daily things, without having the fear to break your $200-$500 tablet.Let me mention some of the pros and cons of this machine, and this is my personal observation.Pros:For the price, it is pretty rugged and well made, you won't break it easily (but do not test it :-))It has Google Play apps, which is important.It is not large, can fit into a large pocket, or holder.Battery life is considerably long and that makes it great for travel.Easy to touch by finger and price is very affordable.Cons:The volume does not go to levels that you could hear some stations, prepare to use headphones in some cases.No GPS is installed in this machine, map directions cannot be used on road.App pages are limited, but it still isn't bad.Camera quality is very basic. Do not expect to have high quality pics.Overall, I am very happy with this tablet so far. It is an affordable machine, and you get what you pay for. I also have a Samsung S2 which is much higher in quality on all levels. But hey, this is a machine that if you break, it won't break your heart with it.

I admit there are a few things the Galaxy has as features this tablet doesnt do, but for the most part it can do all you need (unless you are a high end user).  This tab comes with just under 1gb memory onboard.  I do recommend you buy an 8gb micro SD card (TF card) to go with when ordering as most aps want to install to the card.  Set up was easy and second nature~ no having to flash the bios, or other such nonsense that many other no-name tablets had on their reviews to get Google Play (market).

Its biggest advantage is that it comes rooted from the factory. With a fast SD card (Class 6 or better), it runs full screen, full motion, video without even straining and it's compatible with Kindle. Granted, the camera isn't the greatest but, hey, look at the price and move on. The WiFi connection is rock steady and this tablet can also be set up as a Wireless Hot Spot. Audio Quality is outstanding and it even has a rudimentary Graphic Equalizer, along with sound FX, included. Obviously, the video quality isn't what an iPad or one of the more expensive Android tablets would offer but, again, look at the price and move on. It's good enough that only a comparison with something a LOT better will show its shortcomings. You can set up one of three different kinds of start-up security but be warned: If you password protect this tablet you MUST use a USB keyboard to log on. Otherwise, you won't get in.There are a few small, (to me at least), problems with this tablet:1) I originally purchased this tablet from Sears and those, (I purchased two for my grands), had the Adobe Reader, Skype, Netflix, Angry Birds, Fruit Ninja, Flipit, and Solitaire preloaded but this one did not. Apparently, this is a slightly different, (read: Newer), version of this tablet and that accounts for the difference in available out-of-the-box apps. That's not a con for me personally, but for those of you who buy a tablet for any of the above, be aware that you'll have to download all those apps.2) The viewing angles are actually pretty good EXCEPT....If you tilt the top of the tablet too far back, you will get what amounts to a negative image. The other viewing angles are about what you would expect with a flat screen. If you, as I did, buy this tablet with one of the keyboard cases that have the \"kickstand\" on the back, you won't have to worry about this problem except when using the tablet in Portrait position.3) The specs say it has 4Gb of internal storage but unless there is something here that I'm not aware of, this tablet has only 2.5Gb of actual, usable, internal storage. For me, that's no big deal because I'll be using it mostly as a reader for Kindle books. For someone who wants to load a bunch of apps and games, be aware: There is not as much internal storage space as you think there is. On the upside, the tablet will accept up to a 32Gb Micro SDHC card and you can also plug in a USB Flash Drive so storage space, (except for apps which just don't play well unless installed to the primary \"hard drive\"), is not really an issue.4) I'm not sure if this is really a con but I need to mention it. The battery life seems to be a bit short. I've gone from 100% to about 20% in a couple of hours of intense surfing. That said, I've also watched a 2+ hour movie with no problem at all, so it could just be me. On a brighter note, Comodo has a free battery saver app that's worth its weight in gold. So far, I've seen a 2x increase in battery life after installing that app.5) This tablet is woefully short on documentation. The included manual is nothing more than a Quick Start guide and there is a shortage of any kind of technical information about this tablet on the Net. After a bit of searching I found the manufacturer's web page, [...], but there is very little useful info there. Again, this is not a con for me personally, I do computers for a living, but the average user needs to be aware that if you buy this tablet, you'll need to do your own problem solving because there is very little in the way of help from the manufacturer.I put this tablet through rigorous testing over a period of a month. I did everything I could to it, short of actually \"Bricking\" it, (or throwing it against a wall), to see how much it could take and how well it performed. I actually got it to freeze but a quick Google session, (Hold the power button and the volume up button at the same time until the tablet shuts off [About 5 seconds]. Press and hold the power button as instructed in the manual to turn the tablet on and you're back in business), produced a solution to that problem. I can truthfully say that this tablet is built like a Timex. The Boomers who read that last will understand exactly what I mean by that and why, as a result, I'm giving this tablet a 5 star rating.I bought two of these as birthday presents for my grands and I liked them so much that I got one for me and will buy at least two more for two more of my grands. They come with everything you need, (USB OTG adapter, USB Data Cable, Stylus, Earphones, Screen protector, and Charger), and they can be used with a USB Keyboard/Mouse. You could even attach a USB Mini-Hub if you'd like. This particular version also solved the problem of the shaky charger connection and even included better quality, noise cancelling, in canal earphones.Bottom Line: If you're a fan of Great Performance to Price Ratio and you're looking to break into the world of tablets, without breaking the bank, you want this tablet.

Since that tablet is no longer on the market, we purchased another \"no-name\" device, figuring it'll all be the same. Boy, we were so wrong.To start with some positives, this tablet looks cool. It is small and lightweight, and it connected to our wifi fast. Now I will elaborate on why I gave it one star. We don't expect much of those cheap tablets, we only want it to load and play the internet videos and display pictures. That is what our daughter uses it for. However, this tablet would not load the videos. Youtube website will load, but the video will be loading and loading forever. It might have loaded eventually, but I never waited for longer than 5 minutes. I figured, it it takes 5+ minuted for a simple few minutes video to load, my daughter will have a problem with it. I was very disappointed, I so wanted to keep this little tablet.Another thing we noticed, is that the tablet would shut down periodically on its own. What the heck is that, so annoying. Plus the battery life is measle, it lost 50% of its charge in about 30mins being turned on and connected to wifi. And finally, I made sure I ordered a black device. However, the one delivered to us was red. The stylus was not included either, although advertised.All in all, this parody of a tablet went back the very next day. Amazon was great, made the return easy, fast and simple. Needless to say, I would strongly advise to stay away from this product.

The manual that comes is very very tiny and also in broken English, probably used a translating program so you tend to scratch your head a bit.. that is IF you can read it, the print is so small I had to get a magnifier to read it and then discovered it was of almost no use at all.  So without any instructions it was/is hard to sort of figure out how it works.  It took me a considerable amount of time just to figure out how to set up the internet WiFi.... but once I figured out the simplicity of it.. it was set up in seconds .  The downside is that sometimes the device just does not want to let you get onto the internet even when the signal is strong.. unsure what is causing that issue... but you can come back later and try it and it might go onto the internet easily.. so don't know what is hanging it up.The device itself feels a bit flimsy but is also very light weight. The screen colors are fine and the sound is \"just ok\" .  I haven't tried Netflix yet but if there are issues I will edit this review.The battery is not very good, and I am not wild about the charger that came with it, however you can use it and play games on it while it is plugged in and being charged.  The type of battery that is in it.. the instructions say it is better to let it run out completely before you recharge it.. and if you have issues because you have charged it to soon.. to let the battery run out completely then recharge it.On the Positive side... For the price ($77.00) it is a pretty decent little handheld.  It accesses tons of games, almost all of the  same games I have on my Kindle Fire.. many many free ones and most games are between 99 cents to 2.99. The game downloads go easy and the game play is fine. The touch screen is very responsive and it takes only a gentle touch to play the games or select items.  I do plan to expand the memory with a micro sd card but may find that I don't need to.  I have half a dozen games on it right now and in less than 24 hours I am getting to understand the device. It is not a Kindle or a Ipad.. it is what it is.. which is a ok value for what you pay for it.  I dont mind the quirks with the internet for I think I will be able to figure that out as time goes by.  I originally bought it for my husband to be able to look thinks up on the internet but think I will probably just load games on it and let it go at that.. my husband will use it a bit or the grand kids will surely play the games so it was worth the price just to have a small handheld game player around for them to play.Would I buy it again? probably  Would I give it as a gift?  probably  of course this opinion is based on only having the device up and running for 24 hours  and hard to predict if it will hold up.", "Date": "January 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice", "Author": "Mrs. Kia", "ReviewID": "R1TCM0WSC220PQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The only problem is that I have yet o find out no to put on the parental control.

I am sending it back for a refund.  Very disappointed!-----------------Previous reviewSo I just received my Zeepad last night.  First impression out of the box, it is better than I expected.  I ordered it thinking how good could a $70 dollar tablet be. and how much can it really do compared to the more expensive brands and models?  Well I was surprised.  It is a bit heavier than I expected, but that just gives it a more substantial feel.I have a 'better' tablet already.  I have the ASUS Eee Pad TF101 32Gb and love it.  But I was wanting something a bit smaller that wouldn't break the bank.  I read alot on my tablet so it goes almost everywhere with me, but the ASUS can be a little big for the handbag:)  I wanted something that would fit better in my purse for on-the-go reading, but I also wanted a bit more then just an ereader in case I wanted to look something up on the internet or play a game to pass time somewhere.  Yes I could have gone with the KindleFire or Nook Tablet but they are still well over $100+.  I also like having access to the wide variety of Apps that are available with Android.  I'm not totally sure what all is available with Kindle and Nook.I saw this and several people who purchased had said they were pleased so I decided to give it a try.It connected to my home wireless easily.  The touch screen is responsive, much better than I expected. I immediatly went to Google Play and began downloading and installing Apps I wanted.  No problems there.  I went to the browser and everything was working OK except for one of my favorite web pages.  When it loaded all I got was a blank screen.  Reloading didn't help.  I went back to the Apps store and downloaded Firefox and Opera web browsers to see if they would display the page.  Finally after paying with settings I got my page to come up in Opera.  I'm really not sure why this web page was having such a problem on this tablet but i got it to work so I'm happy:)With the display only being 800x480 everything is not as crisp as my ASUS but by increasing the font size on my ebooks they read OK.  I haven't tried any videos or the camera on it yet so can't address those at this time, but then that wasn't the primary reason I wanted it.  Also haven't tried to connect it to my laptop to see how syncing and transfering files over to it works.  The web browsering and reading capabilities, in a more portable size, was what I wanted and for those pursposes I am happy with it.We'll see how it goes after a few weeks with it:)", "Date": "December 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "She's enjoying it", "Author": "Tarche", "ReviewID": "R28MQG0WB9JW7X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this from a company called Goodios and it came with a pen and car charger and this company was very accurate whenever i would email them..

I never did get another tablet after having a bad experience with this one. I lost my money with this purchase. Just wish I could have got a replacement. I would spend the money on the more expensive ones.**UPDATE: I decided to contact the manufacturer because it was still under warranty. They told me they would fix the tablet but I had to pay to ship it to them and pay to have it returned back to me. So I basically would be paying more for the tablet then I already have.

I will say they run and work great WHILE THEY LAST. They can not take any wear and tear at all. So lets start with zeepad number 1 I ordered it got it in good time wanted to get it charged and set up before she opened it so she could play right away. I open it put it on to charge and it wont charge unless I prop  it  on something to put pressure on it. I should have sent back right away but I ordered it late and party was next day figured I could give to her and see if it was just outlet. After one week it would not charge at all. So I send back get a new one. I get it charges fine so i think ok other one just bad but after 2 weeks it will not charge you have to fiddle with charger to get it to light then another few days will not charge at all So I send back again to get the THIRD ZEEPAD. The third time the charger just fell inside after 3 weeks use. So after the last time I said screw this  go on another site find a kindle fire for 70 dollars got it and have had it 6 months now. Do not buy this product it may work great the first month but after that it WILL break and if u pass the warranty you are out of luck. There are times you can find good deals where you pay cheap price but get a great product. This is not one of those products you get what you pay for on this one. You are better off spending a bit more and getting something that will last. This not worth it. Yes I know I was only spending like 60-70 dollars on a tablet so I cant expect the world. I didn't want to spend 300-400 on a top of the line product for a 7 year old to play on so I just went with this and like I said I cant expect a product that will last years but 3 of these in like 2-3 month is bad she only got about a month all together of play time because a lot of this was shipping back then you wait for them to get bad product before they ship new one. So she got a little over a month on all 3 and after the second one I made sure I was the only one charging it just to be sure it was not her being ruff on it. I was only one charging it was so careful and still charger problem. Just wanted to give everyone a warning because I was so disappointed she was so excited to get one and I was happy to get her one and I was let down.

The charger is not the typical UBS or iPad type, but a thin connector, which is impossible to buy at regular stores.  So when the battery goes dead on a car ride, you are simply out of luck.

The hyped 3 hour run time (which isn't all that great to begin with) is in reality more like 20 minutes or less.  Charging takes awhile and the charging power supply gets warm so it seems to be working, but the battery is weak.  (wifi on notifications off, screen brightness set to ~80 percent)The screen resolution looked pretty good until I loaded some pictures and test patterns into my Ainol Elf 2 (another bargain priced brand X tablet) and compared them side by side, the Elf wins hands down.  The Zeepad does have a somewhat better viewing angle, but the display looks \"flat\" compared to the Elf.I never could get Netflix to work.  (and hadn't gotten it working on the Elf either until just recently)  Unfortunately my wife has the Zeepad now so I can't try messing with Netflix, but I suspect the newest Netflix app will work on it.If you have problems with Netflix Google for \"com.netflix.mediaclient_3.0.0 build 1010.apk\" That is the latest Netflix app and seems to be working.  No need to register with an app store and it can be found on the net for free.I  haven't decided what to do about the battery problem.  I can replace it for $10-15 but that option isn't going to be open to most of the people that buy these things.12/6  My wife has had it all the time so I don't really get a chance to play with it.

I think we are seeing the difference between acrylic and polycarbonate judging by the scratches.Battery life is still bad, but she can get ~1 hour if she turns off the wifi, and app updater (which needs wifi to work). I also got her a new charger and that has been working faster than the one supplied.  She still runs the display at 100% brightness which eats some run time, compared to the 80% I was using.Netflix is working like a champ now.  Ap update worked wonders.  Of course the wifi must be on so the battery life is shortened.", "Date": "October 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "I hate it", "Author": "Tamara Saint-Joie", "ReviewID": "R388YN5TBV1MMV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Just brought this for my son  it's already not working the first day he had it.

But I haven't used them.It is very cute, and for what I paid I am happy.  But it seems like the RAM is not really sufficient for some apps.I can run kindle ok, which is what I really want to use it forSome embedded videos in websites don't really play right. I think because there is not enough memory in the tablet.  I installed google chrome and that seems to work better than the default browser.When I start apps, sometimes the screen goes black... but if I wait about 20 seconds I will see the app interface.Once apps are started up, they run ok.To make the tablet run smoother I disabled notifications, that helped a lot.I am happy with the purchase so far.  I might update the review in a few weeks.For 60 bucks, it is REALLY nice.  I can get away from the computer and still do some things. I love the pink.  I bought a pink cover for it.Filemate ECO 7-Inch Tablet Faux Leather Case with Push Button Clasp - Magenta (3FMTC225MG7-R)The cover fits great, so if you want a way to protect your tab, I suggest that one. I didn't really want a keyboard case for such a small tablet. The on screen keyboard is nice. If you plan to be super productive for business, this is not your tablet because it's not powerful, but it is ok for light recreational use like kindle reading.

When it arrived I rushed to get it set up and download a ton of apps so my son could play with it as soon as he opened it. It was very easy to use although the downloading did take a while. Took approximately 10-15 mins to down load each app and I had purchased about 60 apps (along with some children's kindle books). This was fine since the tablet is priced under $100 (what did I expect, really).My sole issue with this tablet is with the charger. It does not charge well or quickly with the USB cord and the wall charger is difficult to work with. The charger plug does not fit completely into the port so I'm constantly trying to stop myself from shoving it in further. Also, if the plug is not positioned in the port exactly right the unit will not charge. I end up twisting and turning, and wiggling the plug around while constantly checking to see if the tablet is indeed charging. It's a little annoying. If it at least had an LED light that would blink or light up when the unit was charging, I would like it a lot better.Overall, it is a nice tablet especially considering the price. If I could do it over, I would probably purchase the same one again. I may look into purchasing a different charger that might fit the unit better. I did have to purchase a separate MicroSD card since only 40 of the 60 apps I purchased fit onto the tablet. But that was only an extra $20 or so.

They fixed many things and this is just another fix needed.______-------Added------_________After ordering a keyboard, I found that the recommended keyboard/case did not work with it.I also found out that the settings on it are very limited and people, beware, Like the spam mail in you In-box, this has many \"go-to\" adds on many of the apps there.so If you are going to give to children, make sure they do not have CC information nor access to it.If you could tther it, even better.

Pay attention to the delivery date.  It still came 10 days earlier than promised.  I only mention this because I didn't pay attention and wondered when it would show up.  Anyway I have an HP iPaq PDA that holds a lot of my day to day info and it is not getting younger. I don't want the data on my smartphone as I don't want it hacked.  I need to replace the PDA before it dies.  Looking at replacement costs was eye opening to say the least, 500 smackers.  Forget about it.  Then I thought, hey get a 7\" tablet, bigger screen and lots of apps.  I didn't want anything too expensive as it would be an offline one or two use device.  I saw that the Zeepad had a lot of good reviews and got one.  I've had it for several weeks and have punched a lot of data into it.  It is slow and punching data in is time consuming as sometimes the character doesn't register.  But for my purposes, I don't care as I will be inputting once and reading hundreds of times.  As I said slow, you click and then wait 3 or 4 secs but I am a very patient person and it doesn't bother me that much, though I gave 4 stars because of it.  The charger's plug to the tablet is longer than the socket on mine so it doesn't fit all the way in but it charges.  Do not force the plug into socket or you may break it.  One review says the prongs to the wall socket broke, I checked to see if mine were loose and I recommend you do the same.  Bottom line, this is an $80 tablet not a $200 tablet and you have to expect it will not work the same.  If you are looking for an all around excellent, fast 7\" tablet get the Kindle Fire, if you need it for a one or two use device I recommend the ZeePad.", "Date": "February 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great value!!", "Author": "Ashton Brereton", "ReviewID": "R3DP8OKRDZPNEK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted a fully functional tablet that would allow me, wirelessly, to access the internet, check and write emails, and access files on computers on my home network - from anywhere in or around my home - at a price below $100.

The only reason I don't give it five stars is that it does not have a backward facing camera - so I can't can't scan documents. The front-facing camera works perfectly. So, in sum, I recommend it unreservedly - at the price.UPDATE:I have been using the Zeepad more often now and found that the built-in browser was somewhat slow - taking seconds to access main pages for sites such as CNN, NBC and BBC - and occasionally the browser froze. So, I installed Opera Mini for tablets (free) and found the increase in speed of access to web pages was dramatic. Access is now in less than a second, the formatting of the pages was changed to suit the Zeepad screen, the font size was automatically increased, scrolling is a breeze and all the stories and information are available.

The packaging screams cheap but that's to be expected with an 80.00 tablet.  what was not expected was the inability to play music, it does play... 60 seconds after you click a button in Google Music and once it's started you cannot stop it for another 60 seconds, the point is this is ridiculously slow, even after removing everything installed on it. Displaying album art is non existent as well as even the song names.  if you click out to look at another album, you better go brew a coffee and take a shower, it might be ready when you get back.  This was not a symptom of Google's app either as all the other music players I tried had the same issues.On top of that turning it on and off is a problem, after it goes into sleep you have to hold the button for 30-60 seconds for it to reboot, it will not turn back on after it shuts down the screen like all other tablets do.  I read some of the reviews and unless I got a bum tablet I cannot see how anyone can get this to work properly, there is no way anyone can function by clicking a button and waiting 30 seconds for something to happen.Try it, think \"click\" in your head and then count to 30. that's how long it takes to respond when an app is open.I cannot say how it plays games but if a simple MP3 is any indication this is not worth 8 dollars let alone 80.I would not give this item to my worst enemy... or wait, maybe I would...We should have sent Osama a few of these in 2001, we'd have found him in the same cave still trying to power it on.Update 01/20/2013: after looking at this thing siting in the box waiting for the return I decided to try one thing, I forgot that I did not erase my google credentials so I opened it and did a \"reset\".Oddly enough, now the thing is snappy enough to play the music and show albums and turn on and off properly, not sure what did it and it doesn't change my rating but it now works for my purpose  So if you get a sluggish unit, try resetting it in the settings of the device.", "Date": "January 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pathetic", "Author": "Kazim", "ReviewID": "R21SS802A84IN5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Don't buy this s***ty product.

He is VERY rough with toys and anything that's electronic. I was hesitant to give him a tablet of any kind but he had shown great interest in using his mom's Kindle Fire (under her watchful eye!), including practicing reading skills, so I decided to go with a budget-priced tablet and get him one of his own. We are now at week 3 with his use of the Zeepad and so far, so good! He uses it daily for Netflix, Angry Birds and reading e-books. I estimate he's put at least 80 hours of use into the tablet and it still functions perfectly.I was VERY pleased with the quality of the video, given the price range. I was expecting Netflix movies to appear blocky and lo-res looking but that's not at all the case. I'm very pleased with the overall performance of this tablet. I've had no problems logging into Google Play and installing new apps. Keep in mind - this tablet is NOT going to set speed records. Yes, there are lag times in contrast to higher priced tablets but we're talking maybe 1 to possibly 5 seconds (Netflix in particular can take several seconds to boot up). But once an app is up and running, we've had no performance problems.One BIG caution. The battery life is very short before recharging is required. He usually just stays plugged in (you can charge and use the device at the same time) to avoid having the tablet shut down during a record-breaking Angry Birds game. I estimate the battery life is 2 to 2.5 hours tops.If you are able to cope with the short battery life, I highly recommend the Zeepad for kids and for anyone who is looking for a low-priced tablet.", "Date": "April 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "GREAT!!!", "Author": "Stephanie Starling", "ReviewID": "RYXUHR4KV71IL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We purchased this for our 3 year old because she loves to play on our phones.

The pin alignment for the power source is very small, and the edging / border sort of hid the pin area. I did have to wiggle it around a little bit for it to make a connection.  I was hopeful when it displayed a green battery - but instantly it turned red, and powered off.I tried to connect with the micro usb to usb cord.  It did turn on momentarily with a logo, then immediately shut down.The bottom edge border of the tablet seemed raised, and when I pressed on it, it clicked into place.  Hoping this helped with the alignment, I tried to attach the power source again.The green battery light appeared only for an instant, when I moved it on to a table to charge.  This made the powersource lose a solid connection and again this red battery light appeared.I'm very disappointed.

ANTIVIRUS AS SOON AS U GET TABLETThe tablet comes installed with games and 2 of the games came up as potentially threatening so if u just hand it to your kid and they try to play those games u are at risk I use avg pro its still$15 bucks but I have it installed on 4 devices so worth the money u can get it in the play store this tablet is awesome but an adult should go thru all the settings and run spywear b4 handing it over to kids as I said in my updates whoever rooted the device changed the settings if u run avg it will walk u thru the settings at the end of the scan to protect your deviceI bought this tablet for my 18 month old daughter because she is determined to keep up with her older brothers and loves all the learning apps available for young toddlers I must say this tablet is great for her im going to try to find a kid tuff case of course the tablet is on the cheaper side I only paid 76 bucks im not complaining all the apps work and this tab has options to delete installed apps and options to move apps to sd card I did not have those options on my galaxy so not bad at all shes gonna be so excited to play her word games when she wakes up from naptimeUpdateJust realized this tab comes rooted I know this is a high selling point for some it makes me a little nervous but so far so good I will update again if anything else pops upUpdateSo my daughter loves it the abc phonics games are a must for anyone with young toddlers the zeepad is definatly great so far of course the speakers suck and itscheap plastic its only $76 bucks I recommend going thru the settings whoever rooted it set those kind of weird still tweaking them my daughter doesnt want to let go of the thing its great for kids and budgets I cnt afford an ipad and if I could im not handing It to my child so this is a great way for u to let your youngster play without losing out on $500 or more if they drop itUpdateDay 2 with the zeepad the charger works its battery life definatly isnt great and it depletes even when your not using the tablet but I also believe those small annoyances to be the reason the zeepad is available for such a cheap price its a wonderful beginner tablet for young kids it comes already installed with kids games and is obviously intended for kids but as I said before if your on a budget an adult could find this useful also its not the fastest or the best thats why its so cheap but its still more than enough for my daughter to watch her shows and play her apps I would definatly recommend this tablet to others great purchaseUpdateThe tablet is still working despite the fact my 18 month old has been drooling and pushing on the screen a little harder than I like then again I bought her the zeepad so she wouldnt abuse my galaxy anymore so I guess I shouldnt complain reading the reviews are what helped me make my purchase and they are also how I determine what seller to purchase from that is ehy I keep updating I feel like this tablet is a good deal if u purchase from a reliable seller and supervise your kids charge it for them its not a tank they can still break it make them sit on the couch while they play it instead of running with it this tablet is cheap and has tons of features but its not durable or it would cost more if u want durable spend $100 more bucks and u will get higher quality this is a great beginner tablet its still quite fast for a single core processor and has tons of features runs netflix youtube and my comcast apps all fine on comcast I have to log out then back in somtimes for it to work but for it $76 delivered its not that big of a deal plus u can install apps that require root access my tablet doesnt do that and to buy higher end rooted tablets is at least $100 more on top of what the going price is so im assuming the negative reviews are the people who bought from the seller at the very bottom offering the dual camera on the probably fake zeepadsUpdateIts been a couple weeks now the zeepad is still charging and works great I only charge it about once a week but I also shut it off when my daughter isnt playing it I think this was a great deal my daughter loves it and it plays all her movies and games without any problemsUpdateThe zeepad is still working just got done loading a bunch of free mp3 songs for my daughter off of the free app I got off google play I really dnt understand all the bad ratings for my$76 bucks this is an amazing deal we have 3 samsung galaxy tab2 also and this tablet does just as much a little slower at times and not as good quality but for the price this is a great dealUpdateSkype works and all of the other apps we have loaded on here just got done reading elmo and dora ebooks we downloaded on the kindle app I still cnt figure out why people dnt like this tablet I'm writing my review on it rn the battery isn't that bad and why would u want your child playing 5hrs of games a day anyways either way zeepad still works and we still love it", "Date": "March

A plus is that it comes with a screen protecting sheet(that you have to apply) but its one less thing you need to worry about buying and if you are looking at this guy, you value saving some $$. The plastic cover is quite solid but the edges do scuff up pretty quick. The battery lasts about 2 hours and that is acceptable for the price. If you are thinking about using this as a PC substitute please keep in mind that after the OS you only have about 1.9Gbs of space left; bought a 32Gb microsd from scandisk and the system recognized it right away; but only as a 29.8Gb device(might be file system configuration, but that's enough space for me. It comes with angry birds and fruit ninja installed and it was a great excuse to have some random children play with it and although they handled it as if it was made of solid titanium; it came out with minor scratches, but non on the screen because of the protector.The major down side for this device is the charger; as noted before it doesn't fit all the way and most of the time you have to \"giggle\" it around so that it will start charing; but the usb cable charges perfectly, just takes longer; I get a full charge from 2% to 100% in about 15 minutes on wall charger and about 23 on usb.I would have given it a 5, had it come with bluetooth or at least gps support.

That was my first mistake not reading thoroughly as I usually do and not buying within the United States. The tablet was slow doing anything,the battery life seemed to be short,there is no reset button to try. The settings menu for example looking up battery use you couldn't tell where you stood it says like 40% and then it would die. But, that wasn't the biggest issue as had it for a month and now it's completely dead. Now, if we go with just a bad tablet it happens and or something about the seller and overseas I can't answer about this tablet as it gets rave reviews which is why I bought it. One big positive I can say is the Amazon A-Z Guarantee. Make sure you have it. I asked them to step in when I was only having trouble before totally dying and I believe in less than 24 hrs. it was resolved and I received a full refund.  Another big positive to have on electronics from Amazon is the Square Trade Warranty. It's worth the extra money. I have had to use it in the past on another item and that is also everything you read on reviews. Easy,fast,amazing. Trying to be fair.

I added a couple of leftover mini SD cards I had from old smart phones to increase the storage space for the kids.The only issues we have had with these tablets have all been in with either the original seller (not Goodios) or the quality control of the product. We originally ordered these 15 days before christmas to be from Santa. These never arrived, Amazon refunded our money and that company is no longer in business. Beware of the folks with the cheapest price. We then re-ordered these from Goodios who have been perfect in solving our problems. Our first set of these arrived and one of them was dead on arrival. It was quickly replaced with another that had a bad charger. We had a new charger within a couple of days and then found out the little USB connector was also defective. They sent us one of those and now everything works fine.We got the little USB keyboards that double as covers which work fine with one exception. When the Zeepad is in the case and the case is turned vertically the Zeepad can slip out of the little claws that hold it in. As these cases are all made the same I will put either double sided tape or some velcro on ours to keep this from happening.We really like these tablets and they kids have been using them up everyday when they get home from school for over a month. If Zeepad improved their quality control we would have had no issues with them at all. The 4 stars are because of this.  But for the price we really can't complain much about that either.", "Date": "February 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "review", "Author": "hona6969", "ReviewID": "R1LELPZDYM2KT2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I would review this but I haven't even got it!

I emailed the company (because they didn't list a phone number - I wanted to talk to someone personally) and didn't get a responce.

I have waited for over 10 minutes for the i-reader to load with no luck.  The i-reader shows it loaded and is taking up memory it just doesn't work for what ever reason. Good thing it uses Android, I loaded the kindle (for free from Amazon) on it and now can load books through the kindle. I also use the local e-library so the kids can check out books online. The unit is not the fastest but for the kids it is good. It would be nice if there was a customer support or at least more information in the box for use of this unit, or they could load the information on a tutorial on the desktop.  But over all it seems to be an desent unit for the money. We don't let them use it for social media or e-mail so I can not comment on that. They do use it for games and internet research and it apprears to be doing fine for that, so I would assume that the e-mail and social media would be fine as well.  It streams the video's well from you tube. My kids watch the Looney Tunes video's when they finish thier reading (30 min. a day only).  The picture is clear so vidoe is good. The outter case or shell doesnt' seem to be to durable, so I am glad that they have not dropped it yet.

All were about 85% charged.  Each Zeepad connected to my wi-fi home network in a matter of seconds.  Touch screen was responsive and a breeze to navigate.  I am pleasantly surprised with the overall build quality and remarkable functionality of the Zeepad.While not as fast as the Google Nexus 7, which has a hotter Arm Holdings designed processor, the Zeepad's speed is quite adequate.  I was drawn to the Zeepad since its processor is also an Arm design and the Android operating system is tough to beat.  Image or screen quality is inferior to the Nexus but decent.  The difference can be noticed when viewing the screen from an angle, but as long as the view of the Zeepad is straight on, the quality is good, not great.  To put the review in perspective, remember the Zeepad is well below $100 and, at this price point, I think this product is a real value.  Actually, it is a remarkable surprise.  My grandkids opened these on Xmas Eve and within seconds were connected to the net and gazing at more apps (mostly free games) on GooglePlay, where android apps are offered in abundance.  Did not experience any slowness as mentioned in some reviews.  Perhaps the network? Durability is an unknown since we have had the Zeepads for just few days so I'll follow up in a month or so.

(it is not packed into a shipping box).It only gets worse, the screen is extremely scratched, and raised above the frame on one side, and it had a half worn sticker on it.  The WIFI must be within 2 feet in order to connect...but the browser doesn't work anyway.

So I replied back with pictures.Next they agreed it was scratched and offered to send me \"the film\" to repair it and a new charger.There is so much wrong with this Zeepad that a screen and a charger wouldn't come close to fixing it.

(Instructions indicated doing something, but the print is so small and pictures even smaller that even with 20/20 vision I couldnt figure out what it said). The touch pad isn't always all that responsive...but for the most part, it's good enough for a 12 year old. I wasn't using the stylus that comes with it at the time..but perhaps the response from the touch screen would have been slightly better if it had.Ran into some issues of it 'not responding' and not accepting my request to shut the system off to try and fix the problem - eventually I did get it to come out of it's funk and it worked just fine. But it does freeze a bit. Runs a little slow, but with only 512MB of Ram, I chalk that up to the fact it's been a while since I've worked with something with such a slow processing speed.It's a decent reader - the kid prefers the weight and size compared to that massive Nook she got from another relative for Christmas. The fact that it is PINK is possibly the biggest plus. It does run most Google Play apps - so that is a plus since they are mostly free.  The front facing camera is pretty poor quality, so that feature for Skype is there, but know it's about as good as webcams from 10 years ago.

At the time it only had 26 reviews total.  But even the negative reviews were helpful.  This being said, I am an owner of a Galaxy Epic cell phone, and know what the \"average\" tablet can do (all my cell does, just a bit bigger).  This tablet could and does compete with the Galaxy.  I admit there are a few things the Galaxy has as features this tablet doesnt do, but for the most part it can do all you need (unless you are a high end user).  This tab comes with just under 1gb memory onboard.  I do recommend you buy an 8gb micro SD card (TF card) to go with when ordering as most aps want to install to the card.  Set up was easy and second nature~ no having to flash the bios, or other such nonsense that many other no-name tablets had on their reviews to get Google Play (market).  We purchased 2 with \"Christmas Money\" and we are discussing saving up for 2 to 5 more (we are a family of 7).  They are reasonably priced, and well made, and fit our families needs.****UPDATED**** Battery expanded and after 9 mo no longer works.  The battery broke open the Tablet.  I am disappointed.  The child who this tablet belonged to, was not hard on the item, and it had been on the shelf for a couple weeks when we went back to get it, it had broke.", "Date": "January 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Waste of Money", "Author": "Stacie Collins", "ReviewID": "RYR2W0RJ2T2OG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Daughter dropped one time and it broke.

We chose to buy this for our ten year old boy instead of an ipod touch for many reasons.  First, he wanted it solely for the purpose of playing games, as he already has an ipod nano.  He has asked for the ipod touch for Christmas, but I hope he is pleasantly surprised as we are!  Secondly - affordability!  My teenage son and I already went onto the playstore and downloaded apps, and I looked in his backpack for the books he is reading and downloaded them so he can read them anywhere! I am certain he will love the netflix and the angry birds along with the other games it comes with.  Bought an extra micro SD card, have set it up wifi in our house.  Love it love it.  Works well so far, hopefully it will continue with regular use!  Thank you for the previous reviews I read which helped me feel confident in this purchase.  The one in particular I agreed with - you can't compare this to the ipad - it's just a perfect mini ipad for games, movies and fun.", "Date": "December 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Zeepad 7.0", "Author": "Brittany Clay", "ReviewID": "R3ULGSS7ZFCI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought two of these for my boys.
