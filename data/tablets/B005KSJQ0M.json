{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good tablet.", "Author": "speedbird57 \"Speedbird57\"", "ReviewID": "R1IOEOOZF2V370", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "An external microphone won't work on the external mic jack unless you insert the plug while the tablet is powered down. Then you power up the tablet, then record your video. Then you power down, remove the mic, and power up and watch your video.It causes a momentary short when you insert the plug when the unit is powered up, which shuts down the recorder.Other than that, I like it. SD slot and USB and removeable battery are good.", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "Toshiba Thrive At100-002 10.1\" Tablet Pc 16 gb Wifi", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41zPVbGlyBL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B005KSJQ0M"}}
