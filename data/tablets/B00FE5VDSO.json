I got a great deal on black Friday after reading so many good reviews and either I got a bad tablet or everyone else has never had a tablet or phone that was somewhat fast.  I really use a tablet for web, email, videos and reading magazines and while this does have a good screen the responsiveness is horrible.  Its a quad core tablet and honestly my original kindle fire that I rooted is more responsive.  I have magazines that are saved on the tablet and every couple pages it has to load and waiting 10 seconds to flip to a new page is ridiculous.  My fire flips though no problem.  It does freeze up at times and then loads again but that is crazy.  The lag it has when touching an app icon is bad.  Web page loading is slightly slower than my s3 which I can live with but the I just cant live with how slow this thing is.  I know I did not get an expensive tablet but a quad core A9 should run faster than my rooted original kindle fire", "Date": "December 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "be careful", "Author": "matthew mona", "ReviewID": "R2Z4DATC9B8WVV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "the thing worked great but it has one flaw that is worth mentioning the charger can be accidently plugged into the ear bud/ headphone port thus frying the charger or the tablet.", "Date": "January 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "It doesn't turn on anymore", "Author": "Vincenzo Fantino", "ReviewID": "R2YM8EYJP7EQ0G", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This tablet was working fine,  but after 2 weeks it doesn't turn on anymore.I am trying to contact tech support with no luck.", "Date": "January 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Disappointment", "Author": "Justin", "ReviewID": "R1BR9QK6XVD70K", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I stayed up all night the night before cyber monday just to get a good deal on this product.

It comes originally with Jellybean 4.1 installed. I purchased one of these tablets in December of 2013; I was happy with the features and performance until I received the notification that an update to Jellybean 4.2.2 was available. I did the upgrade and at first did not notice any problems, but the following day my auto-rotate and my cameras stopped working. I called customer support and they suggested a reset, but this did not help.Since the tablet was under warranty, I returned it to Hannspree, in California. They sent me a brand new tablet, with 4.2.2 installed. This one had the same issues, so I sent that one back as well. I received another BRAND NEW TABLET with the latest software updates. Six weeks later, the same issues popped up. This latest tabled is now on its way back to Hannspree.After doing research online, the common thread seems to be the 4.2.,2 update. Not only does it affect Hannspree products, but others using the android operating system as well. So, save yourself some headaches.

Also bought Walmarts 2 year breakage and spill coverage. After a month unit would not turn on. Called the Hannspree warranty number and after a long wait time talked to a tech who knew virtually nothing. He said they would send me an email to put in a service claim. After completing a long form and sending the email back it kept coming back stating address does not exist.  I called again and after a long wait got another rep who said he couldn't help me. When I asked for a supervisor he hung up. Luckily, I called Walmart service who were very good and refunded my money.

It lasted exactly 2 weeks, then totally died.  Nothing.  Dim gray light when plugged into the charger but otherwise gone.  Luckily I was able to get my money back, but here's my thoughts on it.Basically this is a first-year model for Hannspree.  When it worked, it was great!  Just like a first-year model of a car, you usually wait for all the bugs to be shaken out.  The same is true for this tablet.  I would consider purchasing it again in about 8-12 months, assuming Hannspree gets it fixed.For now, avoid this model or make sure you have a good return policy in place!", "Date": "January 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "You get what you pay for, not a lot", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3JK2IGZ0VV9Z3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I read all the reviews prior to purchasing this tablet so I knew what I was getting in to. It is slow and has some issues freezing up.  There are also some display issues that are strange, some text and graphics won't display on apps. It's want you would expect for $130 tablet. My wife's Kindle Fire HD out-performs it hands down.It takes forever to charge and the battery only lasts about 12 hours even if it's in standby / sleep mode. I will leave it fully charged with the display off at 8am and by 6pm it's almost dead.  The display wasn't on at all during that time and I have it set to disconnect the wireless connection so it isn't receiving data during that time.I bought this as a starter tablet and it serves that purpose, not much more. I will be upgrading to a name brand tablet soon.Another thing to consider is it's almost impossible to find accessories that work for this tablet.  I'm on my 4th case this month. If I had it to do over again I would spend the extra $100+ and buy the ASUS MeMO Pad FHD 10 ME302C-A1-BL 10.1-Inch 16GB Tablet.

The power buttons and volume buttons feel cheap, the screen resolution looks a lot worse than it is actually rated for.  Overall, this product is horrible!!.  Stay away and do not by.  You all have been warned.  I will be returning this product to amazon since it does not me my needs.  If you want a tablet that takes 5 minutes to load a website, than this tablet is for you.
