{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Wow, well worth the money!", "Author": "Chris in Phoenix", "ReviewID": "R3HNT9UGAUK35T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have several Android devices - phones and other tablets. I wanted a tablet for my daughter for Christmas; she is 8, and very tablet savvy (they use them at school, and also she uses mine). The pink case sold me on it, and the price (< $80 delivered). However, I was skeptical of the cost, and how functional it would really be.First off, it shipped very fast by USPS. It arrived within a few days. It was pristine. Along with the tablet was a screen protector, USB cable, charger, USB type-A adapter (which I assume is to connect USB devices such as flash drives and *maybe* keyboard - I plan to test both of these later today), earbud headphones and a decent (although unnecessary) stylus. Initially, I thought the screen was scratched, and not very responsive, but there is a protective plastic cover over it. Take that off, and put the screen protector on instead and it looks and works great. The capacitive touch is very good, especially considering the price.It has decent performance. It came right up on my office network, and worked flawlessly. Netflix streamed very smoothly. Video playback from Netflix and MP4 files I copied from my PC worked great. Audio playback was reasonable for a tablet, and sounded very good with headphones. Sound through the speaker with video and audio playback was fine (plenty loud). Skype worked fine also, as did various games I tried (Angry Birds and Fruit Ninja come installed). The Android app store came right up, and I had no problem downloading apps and music.By default, the tablet comes in USB storage device mode, which did not work with Windows 7 x64. Not sure why. I switched the tablet to Media Device mode and was able to copy photos, music and video to it with no issues. The popup keyboard worked fine; no issues. Typing emails and texts works great; it synced right up to my Gmail account no problem.Overall, I am very impressed. This is well worth the money. The display is nice, and very readable. The battery seems comparable to my wife's Nook Color. With a bit of tweaking, this could be a fantastic tablet for anyone. Well worth the money. In fact, I am amazed at the price. I highly recommend.MORE INFO - NEXT DAYSome additional info for those considering this tablet. The USB port is a micro USB, same as what you find on most Android smart phones and tablets. It uses the same cable and charger as my Motorola RAZR MAXX and my wife's DROID X2. Also, it appears to support OTG (on-the-go) USB. It will connect to a PC to transfer files (photos, documents, videos, etc.) and will also connect to a USB flash drive. Inside the box is a Type-A USB adapter cable. You connect your USB flash drive to it, then connect to the Zeepad and open the Android file manager (see photos). Also, I connected a USB keyboard this morning in the same way (via the Type-A adapter) and that worked, too. I was able to type/edit a letter, and type an email. No app was required for the keyboard, it was immediately recognized.I have tested Netflix, Skype, video playback, music playback, Angry Birds, Fruit Ninja, Temple Run, Pinball Deluxe, Hulu Plus, Lookout (anti-virus/malware app), Dolphin Web browser, Google Play, Gmail, and Kindle app (and store) and it all works great. No complaints. I've tested WiFi in three places, including home an office, and it was flawless and fast. The SD flash card slot is a MicroSD, not the standard SD card you find in most digital cameras. The MicroSD is very common on smart phones and tablets. The Zeepad 7 looks to support 16 GB cards with no issues.Android System App says the OS is 4.0.4 (Ice Cream Sandwich). Kernel build is 3.0.8+. Internal storage shows max 1008 MB for downloaded apps + 1636 MB for app data, and photos/videos/music transferred from your PC. Max RAM is 353 MB. Everything else is tied up by the OS. Adding an 8 GB or 16 GB MicroSD card would be best for storing music, photos and videos, and off-loading some apps and app data (that support off-loading to removable flash, not all do). The battery is reported as being a LiFe battery, which is lithium-iron-phosphate (LiFePO4). If true, that's impressive. LiFe is a high performance and capacity technology with a long cycle life (up to 2000 cycles, or 3-4 times that of lithium-ion). Such batteries are extremely safe; they will not explode or catch fire if over-charged or short-circuited. They can also be charged very rapidly, and can last 5+ years. So, if I can trust what the Android System App is telling me, I'm impressed. The display is 800 x 432, 60 Hz refresh, with a 160 dpi display density. It is very readable, and bright. I am running mine at 40% brightness. The CPU shows as being an ARM v7 running at 1008 MHz. The clock rate is variable; it will range between 60 and 1008 MHz automatically to reduce power drain - the OS does this automatically.Some things it does not have: obviously, no mobile networking support, only WiFi. So, you need to be in a WiFi hotspot to access the Internet (which is getting easier and easier in so many public places). There is no GPS. There is no rear-facing camera for taking photos, just the front facing camera for making video calls (that seems like an oversight to me, because a 5MP phone camera would be cheap to add). There is no Bluetooth, and no way to add it. None of these things are show-stoppers in my opinion for a $70 tablet, but would be nice if tablet designers could make some of this stuff available as modular user upgrades.Bottom line - this tablet is worth the price. Best $70 I've spent in a while.", "Date": "December 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Starter Tablet", "Author": "Lishai", "ReviewID": "R17OA01F0IUGOT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased product for my kids and I love it.

I recommend this product to everyone looking for and affordable tablet.", "Date": "November 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Great Value. Glad I found it.", "Author": "lj", "ReviewID": "RC3E67V4P6KGW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "***UPDATED*** 11/18/13I promised I would update this review as time went on. This tablet has officially died. It will not turn on or charge no matter what I try.I still stand by my earlier statements that this is a good \"value\" purchase and/or entry tablet for young kids. Although you would expect things to last more than a year. I haven't looked into what the warranty is but I'm sure we're past it. It has served its purpose for us and I will be buying a better tablet later on to replace this one.If you know your expectations and you want a tablet that is cheap for young kids who may be rough on them, I recommend this tablet as long as you are not expecting more than a year and can deal with the issues I listed below.Otherwise, I would officially change my recommendation to a \"Do not buy,\" or Buyer beware. If you are looking for a Nexus/Galaxy/iPad type experience, keep looking.***UPDATED*** See below original review***I just bought this for my son for Christmas and it came in the mail today. It has an expandable micro sd card slot (TF)and most people will probably need it. (Keep reading) I bought this one: SanDisk microSDHC 8GB Class 2 Card with SD Adapter (SDSDQ-8192). I've always found Sandisk to be pretty reliable. The onboard memory states 4 gb but the available memory was about 1gb so keep that in mind if it's important to you. Memory cards are dirt cheap and can easily get you where you want cheaper than going the \"other\" route.I took the pad out to play with it some. It comes installed with Angry Birds, Netflix, Facebook, Fruit Ninja, Play Store, Adobe flash player and of course your regular items (wallpaper, camera, clock widget, browser, wifi, etc.)Some have said the packaging had a knockoff look. A better choice of words would be that it has \"generic\" packaging. It's not a ripoff or knockoff which connotes images of backstreet deals from some guys trunk. That's not a fair assessment of this product. The instruction booklet is admittedly small but who needs an instruction booklet to run a tablet?My only concerns are that it withstands the test of time and the 10 year old. It seems well built. (One minor design flaw is the screen and the outer frame aren't flush with each other so there is a gap. It will definitely collect dirt and be hard to get out.) Not a deciding factor but I can see it getting on my OCD nerves. The camera is also average at best but I never understood why people needed a great camera for a tablet. (Is a tablet really going to be your go to camera for things like vacation?)We bought this for our 10 yr old son. As such I think it's important for people to understand what this tablet competes with. It would be a mistake to compare this to the iPad for both good and bad reasons.It isn't in competition with the iPad but rather the iPod touch. We went with this instead of the iTouch and saved a lot of $. It was $69 for a 4gb Android tablet (expandable to 32) vs. $199 for a 16gb iTouch (not expandable.)I think we made the right choice and I think he will like it. Good luck everyone. Be smart.I will update this review after Christmas when the tablet sees regular daily use.****UPDATE***It's always good to come back and reevaluate a product after the newness has worn off and you can think more objectively. My overall feeling on the tablet hasn't changed much. I would still recommend it to the target audience that I mentioned above. Again, if you are looking for a backup to your laptop or an alternative to an iPad, this probably isn't for you. But for those who have read the description and know what you're getting, this will still be a great product.Here are my impressions over the past week of regular use:Screen: I start with the screen because at first I was turned off by the screen. It is more of a durable plastic. However when I go to my Galaxy tablet and come back to it I am glad for the build and glad that my kids have the Zeepad. It's perfect for them.As such you should know though that it will probably show marks. I'm fine with that. After all it comes with a stylus. The screen protector that comes with it is lacking and we have been looking (unsuccessfully for some that will fit it). Screen protectors for a 7\" tablet Do NOT fit the Zeepad. It is slightly smaller than 7\" so keep that in mind. Also finding a case has been a bit challenging. Universal cases that hold the corners cause it rub against the power button (which may be a design flaw). Nevertheless none of these things would cause me to fret.While I am glad that the screen is durable, others may be turned off of it if they are used to the high glossy, colorful screens. The Zeepad will look dull in comparison but again who are you buying it for?One other issue that has given me pause is the wifi. It works great but it can be quirky at times. One time it was turned off and after selecting on it would immediately turn off again. It would continue to do this until we finally shut it down. After a little while it worked fine. Maybe this was a one time thing. It happens. Also the clock constantly reverts itself to January 1, 1970. I don't know the significance of that date (LOL) but I finally solved this by checking the setting to sync the clock with the network when connected to wifi. Again, maybe this is an isolated event.The battery: I would take off a 1/2 star for the screen build and another 1/2 star for the battery. It definitely doesn't seem to last long but kids do forget to charge things. If you travel a lot this could be an issue for you. You might get a converter to get around this. (Finding a car charger might be difficult. The AC power cord is of the small, round variety.)One last thing: the memory. I said in my original review that the memory issue (comes stock with around 1GB available) could be worked around with a memory card. That is still technically true but in reality it has proven a little more difficult to run apps solely from the memory card. This could be an Android limitation as I am still new to the Android ecosystem. There is an app called App to SD which has made it a little more simpler but I am still not sure that it frees much space on the tablet. There are simply some games that you won't be able to play on this tablet. (So far it seems to be the racing games: Need for Speed, Asphalt, etc.) These use a lot of memory.While it may seem that I have changed my mind on this tablet because of these comments, in reality I haven't. I still consider it a good purchase and the proof of that is the recipient still enjoys it and loves it. However I wanted to be thorough for those who were still thinking of purchasing. All things considered I would still rate this a solid 4 star product and worth the risk if you understand who the target audience is and should be and also temper your expectations in regards to other similar products.PS - Just FYI. A lot of people are leaving negative reviews on this product because of shipping issues. Please read the reviews and find out if this product is for you. I am sad that others had shipping problems. Ours arrived in good time, from West coast to East coast during Christmas rush. Research the seller. There are probably some drop shippers used by Amazon that have nothing to do with the company that makes them. I have seen 2 or 3 different sellers to these.Hope this helps.**BATTERY UPDATE**Some users have experienced issues with the battery. I have monitored this with my son and we have come to the conclusion that the battery life is approximately 2-3 hours. It seems to be about 2.5 hours on average. This is basically Minecraft (which is all he plays) and nothing else. We have monitored it with low power usage apps and received about the same results. In short, you would be fortunate to get over 3 assuming all tablets are the same and this is the norm for these batteries.There was also an issue with the charger. It sometimes prefers certain outlets. Some outlets won't charge it correctly. I am assuming this is an adapter issue since we live in the USA. The adapter seems generic and I am currently trying to find a backup just in case.This still doesn't change much from my initial review but I wanted to keep the review updated. I always appreciated it when people would continue to be open minded toward their products and let others know how it was going.The battery issue may be disappointing to some but as I said above, it really all depends on who you're buying it for. My son has learned to work around it by keeping it charged and in all honesty kids need limits anyway. Long car trips could pose a problem but a converter would do the trick.", "Date": "December 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Buyer Beware - This is a worse than bad SCAM", "Author": "Always Already \"Avid Reader\"", "ReviewID": "R2A9TL4NZY9ZAX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "How can something be worse than bad you might ask. I ordered this product on Jan 24, 2013 from Amazon. I was told it would be shipped from China and I could expect a longer delivery time.  It finally arrived on Feb 26. The tablet did turn on but could NOT be charged.  I was told by Amazon that I would have to contact the seller.  The seller responded that I would have to ship the item back to China at my expense which I did ship it back and kept my proof of mailing and it cost another $30.96.  I shipped it back on March 1, 2013.  It is now May 1, 2013 and the seller via email keeps telling me they will refund my money (less $30.96) \"as soon as they receive the item\".  Well, guess what? After 60 days I do not believe they will ever receive the item.So this is how it can be worse than bad.  Amazon will do nothing and the seller will do nothing and I have lost my original purchase price plus another $30.96 so that I might be able to participate in this scheme.

But I'm certainly glad I took the risk. Considering I wanted this device mostly as an e-reader, the tablet would be worth the price even if all it i did was respond to touch and read PDF's. But it does a lot more. The right thing to do is to not have high expectations. I mean, after all, it's incredibly inexpensive. But I am honestly surprised as to how functional this tablet is.I'll start by listing the cons to get them out the way:-Ports and jacks quality: poor(Some of the physical ports, like the AC and micro USB may not align perfectly. You may need to push hard.)-UI virtual movement response: seldom slight lag.(The UI response lag is slightly noticeable at times, but not significant. Most of the time it responds very well, you have to be very picky to care for a few hundred milliseconds)-Bluetooth: None-Technical Support: Poor/Non-existentNow for the Pros:-Android 4.0 : Excellent OS & UI-Rooted!: Root access enabled(You'll be able to install apps that require root access)-Graphic processing: Impressive(I was able to play Raging Thunder 2, Angry birds Starwars, and some other demanding games without any lag)-G-Sensor: Yes-Display and touch response: Good(The display is much better than others have described it. The touch response is on point)-Micro USB OTG: Allows you to plugin many common USB devices (have tried Flash drives, Mice, Keyboards)-Included Bonus: Ear buds, Micro USB to OTG cable, Screen protector(perfect fit), USB to PC cable, Tablet Pen.Other observations & comments:-The device comes with a proprietary charger, which I thought was kinda lame, until I discovered you can also charge the device using any Micro-USB charger (Recommended use: 5v - 2A).-No micro HDMI (Oh well)-Google Voice recognition works great at a fair distance.-Running: ES File Explorer with LAN file management - Good, Android VNC client - Good, Fling - Good, Google Play - No limitations, SuperUser - Good, ConnectBot - Good, AutoKiller - Good, Terminal Emulator - Good, Tasker - Limited.", "Date": "January 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "AWESOME affordable tablet", "Author": "A friendly helper", "ReviewID": "R2MQFNS4QOWYK6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is one of the best buys i have gotten.

I was pleasantly surprised though. This little tablet is very responsive, the build quality is pretty good, and it even has expandable memory (which my more expensive tablet does not). I bought this as a xmas gift for my girlfriend and overall I'm really happy with it. My only real gripe with it is the screen, but for the price I can't complain. There's no dead pixels or anything, you can kinda just tell the screen is cheap based on viewing angles and quality of images. It's really not that bad though and again, for $80 what do you expect. I especially like the size of this device. It's nice and compact and fits easily in my sweatshirt pocket but yet it's still big enough to where you can set it down and watch something on it.

It is not fancy, not top of the line. It has a low quality feel to it, however, do not be fooled. This is a very good tablet to do your daily things, without having the fear to break your $200-$500 tablet.Let me mention some of the pros and cons of this machine, and this is my personal observation.Pros:For the price, it is pretty rugged and well made, you won't break it easily (but do not test it :-))It has Google Play apps, which is important.It is not large, can fit into a large pocket, or holder.Battery life is considerably long and that makes it great for travel.Easy to touch by finger and price is very affordable.Cons:The volume does not go to levels that you could hear some stations, prepare to use headphones in some cases.No GPS is installed in this machine, map directions cannot be used on road.App pages are limited, but it still isn't bad.Camera quality is very basic. Do not expect to have high quality pics.Overall, I am very happy with this tablet so far. It is an affordable machine, and you get what you pay for. I also have a Samsung S2 which is much higher in quality on all levels. But hey, this is a machine that if you break, it won't break your heart with it.

All were about 85% charged.  Each Zeepad connected to my wi-fi home network in a matter of seconds.  Touch screen was responsive and a breeze to navigate.  I am pleasantly surprised with the overall build quality and remarkable functionality of the Zeepad.While not as fast as the Google Nexus 7, which has a hotter Arm Holdings designed processor, the Zeepad's speed is quite adequate.  I was drawn to the Zeepad since its processor is also an Arm design and the Android operating system is tough to beat.  Image or screen quality is inferior to the Nexus but decent.  The difference can be noticed when viewing the screen from an angle, but as long as the view of the Zeepad is straight on, the quality is good, not great.  To put the review in perspective, remember the Zeepad is well below $100 and, at this price point, I think this product is a real value.  Actually, it is a remarkable surprise.  My grandkids opened these on Xmas Eve and within seconds were connected to the net and gazing at more apps (mostly free games) on GooglePlay, where android apps are offered in abundance.  Did not experience any slowness as mentioned in some reviews.  Perhaps the network? Durability is an unknown since we have had the Zeepads for just few days so I'll follow up in a month or so.

Note: You should charge it as soon as you get it because it takes 6hrs to charge the first 2 times, this is stated in the manual. Also, be careful with the wall charger, mine needed to be adjusted before it could begin charging the tablet. If you charge by USB it might take longer, i found that the wall charger is quicker. YOU SHOULD BUY MEMORY EXPANSION, it's not optional if you plan on adding a lot of items on your tablet you get 1 GB of on-board storage. Make sure you are careful not to drop it, i would not recommend that at all because it doesn't seem like it is able to take much damage. Personally i bought a tablet case with a keyboard a good 1 to use is the 7\" Tablet Stand with USB Keyboard - Black Faux Leather Carrying Case, there is a converter that comes with this tablet that you can hook up to the cases keyboard USB cable. The browsing speed is quite nice and the apps are amazing since they come from the Google play-store. You can stream any type of online content like from YouTube or the web. One thing i found odd is that when your on the main screen and you click the search magnifying glass you see a brief image of previous YouTube videos that you've watched. In my opinion i suggest you uninstall the YouTube app that comes with the tablet and re-install a newer one which fixed my problem. Tip: If you put a SD card in and you want to get it out you push the SD card in and then release it and it will come out. If you decide you want to link a YouTube account with your tablet, and each time you try to login you get an error message. You might need to do the 2-step verification for the Google account you want to link with(additional help just ask). This is an overall good product.

My husband is thinking of the 9 in model. I would recommend getting a case/cover and an 8 or 16 GB micro SD for additional memory. ***Remember this tablet is not specific for any age of user.

All were about 85% charged.  Each Zeepad connected to my wi-fi home network in a matter of seconds.  Touch screen was responsive and a breeze to navigate.  I am pleasantly surprised with the overall build quality and remarkable functionality of the Zeepad.While not as fast as the Google Nexus 7, which has a hotter Arm Holdings designed processor, the Zeepad's speed is quite adequate.  I was drawn to the Zeepad since its processor is also an Arm design and the Android operating system is tough to beat.  Image or screen quality is inferior to the Nexus but decent.  The difference can be noticed when viewing the screen from an angle, but as long as the view of the Zeepad is straight on, the quality is good, not great.  To put the review in perspective, remember the Zeepad is well below $100 and, at this price point, I think this product is a real value.  Actually, it is a remarkable surprise.  My grandkids opened these on Xmas Eve and within seconds were connected to the net and gazing at more apps (mostly free games) on GooglePlay, where android apps are offered in abundance.  Did not experience any slowness as mentioned in some reviews.  Perhaps the network? Durability is an unknown since we have had the Zeepads for just few days so I'll follow up in a month or so.

Not HD, but its not the poor low quality I was expecting. Looks fineComes rooted (but there aren't any roms I would recommend. Just use a CPU app and titanium backup / other root apps).Nice design. I was pleaseantly impressed. Pretty thin and lightRuns ICS with PLAY STORE - not all of these a13 allwinner tablets run off the real play store.USB host. Just plug whatever you want into it. It has worked fine with a keyboard and a mouse (yes, a pointer appears on the screen). I will be trying it with a USB hub and see if it will run a mouse and keyboard togetherUSB cannot be used to charge. It is HORRIBLY slow, and not reccomended. BUT, if you are in a pinch, a usb charger will let it stay on. So as long as you have a phone charger, you can at least turn it on.Good quality, but only for the price. If you want a tablet that runs like a thunderbolt or higher quality phone, go to the $150 - $200 range and grab a dual-coreCons:CPU! - Although these are all advertised as 1.2 - 1.5GHZ, they are not. Yes, the software will allow setCPU (or others) to set it to 1.5GHZ, but this is just overclocking a 1GHZ CPU. Which is why people are getting horrible battery life and freezing. Just set it to 1GHZ. its not really slower, because any higher than 1.2 freezes up and crashes.wifi speed isnt the fastest. all around, its about as fast as a 3rd gen ipod touch for web. Just about every phone I have had has been faster.Screen - My biggest complaint is the screen. quality was good, but the viewing angle is horrible. you have to hold it just right to avoid bad contrast. ESPECIALLY portrait viewing. You cannot look straight at it in portrait. And the screen is about 5% hidden underneath the black edges of the screen.Battery - I have only had it one day, but the battery life seems to be 3-5 hrs if you barely use it. I dont care to keep mine on the charger a lot. otherwise its about 2-3 hrs if you are lucky.(EDIT) After having it for a full 24 hours I have run a battery test from 100%. Battery has lasted almost 13 hours through the night. Up time was about 5 hours. down time (idle or in airplane mode) was 8. So if you set it down in airplane mode, it will do A LOT better.Laggy - music was skipping a little, if you dont constantly close apps, it will get pretty slow. And if you are downloading / installing an app, it can really ONLY do that. everything else slows up til its done. But again, its a budget tablet. And still does better than others in the price range (EDIT: after changing the cpu settings I posted at the top, lagging has almost disappeared. especially if I keep ram clean.Sound - you're gonna need speakers or headphones to watch anything if there is any noise around. pretty quiet. (EDIT: sound can be improved by downloading speaker boost. dont boost more than 40% or you might blow the speaker.)All in all, I like it enough to keep it. Its not great, but I just use it to browse the web and netflix and a few other apps. Nothing major. If you don't have $150 to buy a tablet, this is for you. Just remember its a budget tablet.

First tablet came on great, downloaded apps netflix worked which was one of the 2 most important apps for them.However the second game the kids want so they can play with us will not allow an account to be created because the google location services cannot locate it for some reason. Also when attempting to log into an account already made for that game it says there is already an account linked to the tablet even though we factory reset it multiple times.Second tablet came on great. However the touchscreen is constantly having issues. I could see it showing as if it was being touched somewhere, no where near where we were actually touching. This was leading to frustration and getting no response from the tablet without hitting power button putting it to sleep then waking it up again only to have it do the same thing 3 minutes later. Attempted to use the stylus it comes with and same result no response half the time without putting to sleep first.Third tablet....This tablet would not even turn on at all.This is an aggravation, this is the 3rd tablets we have tried since Christmas and the kids still do not have their christmas presents.

You can set up one of three different kinds of start-up security but be warned: If you password protect this tablet you MUST use a USB keyboard to log on. Otherwise, you won't get in.There are a few small, (to me at least), problems with this tablet:1) I originally purchased this tablet from Sears and those, (I purchased two for my grands), had the Adobe Reader, Skype, Netflix, Angry Birds, Fruit Ninja, Flipit, and Solitaire preloaded but this one did not. Apparently, this is a slightly different, (read: Newer), version of this tablet and that accounts for the difference in available out-of-the-box apps. That's not a con for me personally, but for those of you who buy a tablet for any of the above, be aware that you'll have to download all those apps.2) The viewing angles are actually pretty good EXCEPT....If you tilt the top of the tablet too far back, you will get what amounts to a negative image. The other viewing angles are about what you would expect with a flat screen. If you, as I did, buy this tablet with one of the keyboard cases that have the \"kickstand\" on the back, you won't have to worry about this problem except when using the tablet in Portrait position.3) The specs say it has 4Gb of internal storage but unless there is something here that I'm not aware of, this tablet has only 2.5Gb of actual, usable, internal storage. For me, that's no big deal because I'll be using it mostly as a reader for Kindle books. For someone who wants to load a bunch of apps and games, be aware: There is not as much internal storage space as you think there is. On the upside, the tablet will accept up to a 32Gb Micro SDHC card and you can also plug in a USB Flash Drive so storage space, (except for apps which just don't play well unless installed to the primary \"hard drive\"), is not really an issue.4) I'm not sure if this is really a con but I need to mention it. The battery life seems to be a bit short. I've gone from 100% to about 20% in a couple of hours of intense surfing. That said, I've also watched a 2+ hour movie with no problem at all, so it could just be me. On a brighter note, Comodo has a free battery saver app that's worth its weight in gold. So far, I've seen a 2x increase in battery life after installing that app.5) This tablet is woefully short on documentation. The included manual is nothing more than a Quick Start guide and there is a shortage of any kind of technical information about this tablet on the Net. After a bit of searching I found the manufacturer's web page, [...], but there is very little useful info there. Again, this is not a con for me personally, I do computers for a living, but the average user needs to be aware that if you buy this tablet, you'll need to do your own problem solving because there is very little in the way of help from the manufacturer.I put this tablet through rigorous testing over a period of a month. I did everything I could to it, short of actually \"Bricking\" it, (or throwing it against a wall), to see how much it could take and how well it performed. I actually got it to freeze but a quick Google session, (Hold the power button and the volume up button at the same time until the tablet shuts off [About 5 seconds]. Press and hold the power button as instructed in the manual to turn the tablet on and you're back in business), produced a solution to that problem. I can truthfully say that this tablet is built like a Timex. The Boomers who read that last will understand exactly what I mean by that and why, as a result, I'm giving this tablet a 5 star rating.I bought two of these as birthday presents for my grands and I liked them so much that I got one for me and will buy at least two more for two more of my grands. They come with everything you need, (USB OTG adapter, USB Data Cable, Stylus, Earphones, Screen protector, and Charger), and they can be used with a USB Keyboard/Mouse. You could even attach a USB Mini-Hub if you'd like. This particular version also solved the problem of the shaky charger connection and even included better quality, noise cancelling, in canal earphones.Bottom Line: If you're a fan of Great Performance to Price Ratio and you're looking to break into the world of tablets, without breaking the bank, you want this tablet.

The first one worked for over a year which I consider a fair return on what we paid for it. Since that tablet is no longer on the market, we purchased another \"no-name\" device, figuring it'll all be the same. Boy, we were so wrong.To start with some positives, this tablet looks cool. It is small and lightweight, and it connected to our wifi fast. Now I will elaborate on why I gave it one star. We don't expect much of those cheap tablets, we only want it to load and play the internet videos and display pictures. That is what our daughter uses it for. However, this tablet would not load the videos. Youtube website will load, but the video will be loading and loading forever. It might have loaded eventually, but I never waited for longer than 5 minutes. I figured, it it takes 5+ minuted for a simple few minutes video to load, my daughter will have a problem with it. I was very disappointed, I so wanted to keep this little tablet.Another thing we noticed, is that the tablet would shut down periodically on its own. What the heck is that, so annoying. Plus the battery life is measle, it lost 50% of its charge in about 30mins being turned on and connected to wifi. And finally, I made sure I ordered a black device. However, the one delivered to us was red. The stylus was not included either, although advertised.All in all, this parody of a tablet went back the very next day. Amazon was great, made the return easy, fast and simple. Needless to say, I would strongly advise to stay away from this product.

I will say they run and work great WHILE THEY LAST. They can not take any wear and tear at all. So lets start with zeepad number 1 I ordered it got it in good time wanted to get it charged and set up before she opened it so she could play right away. I open it put it on to charge and it wont charge unless I prop  it  on something to put pressure on it. I should have sent back right away but I ordered it late and party was next day figured I could give to her and see if it was just outlet. After one week it would not charge at all. So I send back get a new one. I get it charges fine so i think ok other one just bad but after 2 weeks it will not charge you have to fiddle with charger to get it to light then another few days will not charge at all So I send back again to get the THIRD ZEEPAD. The third time the charger just fell inside after 3 weeks use. So after the last time I said screw this  go on another site find a kindle fire for 70 dollars got it and have had it 6 months now. Do not buy this product it may work great the first month but after that it WILL break and if u pass the warranty you are out of luck. There are times you can find good deals where you pay cheap price but get a great product. This is not one of those products you get what you pay for on this one. You are better off spending a bit more and getting something that will last. This not worth it. Yes I know I was only spending like 60-70 dollars on a tablet so I cant expect the world. I didn't want to spend 300-400 on a top of the line product for a 7 year old to play on so I just went with this and like I said I cant expect a product that will last years but 3 of these in like 2-3 month is bad she only got about a month all together of play time because a lot of this was shipping back then you wait for them to get bad product before they ship new one. So she got a little over a month on all 3 and after the second one I made sure I was the only one charging it just to be sure it was not her being ruff on it. I was only one charging it was so careful and still charger problem.

When I purchased the replacement it came from Goodios and that unit was MUCH better and did not have any of the deficiencies of the ones which were supplied by Moma..  I can only guess but as a systems engineer I suspect that these (Moma) are factory seconds or somehow a different production run that the normal units and I would avoid purchasing them from Moma based on what we have experienced.", "Date": "July 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Starter Tablet!", "Author": "Dan White", "ReviewID": "R3KB3818CPT9TP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Was a little nervous looking at some of the reviews of this product, but purchased it for a couple reasons. It fit my budget and it seemed to be a great starter tablet.

Neither of us have used a tablet before so keep that in mind.PROS:It arrived packed securely before the expected arrival date (2 days early)It had about a 50% charge when it came, but I stuck it on the charger and left it there for the remainder fo the day (5 hours), the following day I got it back out and started to set it up. The battery lasted all day, but I was working on it it intermittently.WiFi set up was a breezeThe app store had all of the apps I was looking for and the ui was very intuitiveThe screen is very responsive and the colors are vibrant.CONSIt did not come with a screen protector for some reason (minor complaint)The camera is not very good quality considering the average throw away cell phone comes with better image quality these days, but as far as the skype app goes it was a bonus but not why I bought this.In the end for the money I cant imagine getting a better starter tablet than this.", "Date": "May 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Eh, for the price...", "Author": "Maria A.

But it doesn't hold a battery charge for very long, maybe lasting for about an hour.  Also the actual plug connection for the zeepad is crap.  You have to play with the cord and jam it into the tablet in order to get the darn zeepad to charge.  The charger is not the typical UBS or iPad type, but a thin connector, which is impossible to buy at regular stores.  So when the battery goes dead on a car ride, you are simply out of luck.

Spend a bit more and get something that has more of a battery charge and easier to charge.", "Date": "April 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Son is very happy with it", "Author": "Jonathan Ellis", "ReviewID": "R1BGXBFBGP2ZAX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My ten year old saved his allowance for a tablet and chose this one, primarily because unlike most cheap off-brand tablets, it includes Google Play.We also own a 1st-gen Kindle Fire and this compares favorably.

Especially from my son's perspective, better to get the price down as low as possible to start with, and allow expanding it later.The one complaint I have is that it comes with a proprietary charging cable.

The capacitive touch screen is much better than the cheap Archos tablet I had (which quit after a year).  I watched part of a netflix video on the zeepad and it ran well, but the dark scenes didn't show up well due to low contrast.  All other applications I've run were plenty colorful and vibrant.  The processing speed seems better than other cheap tablets.  One little quirk, but so far I haven't been able to keep the time consistently accurate.  It goes back to some factory programmed time zone (maybe China).  The battery doesn't seem to last more than 2-3 hours with constant average use.  Also, the actual screen size is a little smaller than most 7\" tablets but not so much it matters.  The unit does resemble a large GPS navigation system in looks (which doesn't matter to me).

Some of the comments on Amazon had me so concerned about this tablet that I had asked to return it before I even opened it.  After the seller assured me that they would accept this tablet back, I felt guilty for not giving it a try.  When i first opened and saw it, I was impressed.  It is so streamlined, it is beautiful.  It is so intuitive.  If you have ever used a computer before, using this tablet will be a breeze.  I have only had this tablet for a week, but I am in love with it.  The time was preset to China time, but I touched on (selected) Settings (the three little lines on the bottom right of the screen just above the time).  Then I went to System (scroll down) and clicked on Date and Time.  Click on both Automatic Date and Time and Automaic Time Zone to turn them off.  Then click on Select Time Zone to chose your time zone.  Once this is done, Click on both Auomatic Date and Time and Automatic Time Zone to turn them back on.  This will set the date and time according to your time zone.  You will not have to adjust the time at all.  I also was able to get all of the Google Apps that I wanted, once I got the time zone and time settings correct.  And the selection of Google Apps are voluminous, and almost overwhelming.  But you can search the Apps for the App you want.  I was able to get Norton Utilities to protect from viruses, for free.  I was even albe to download an App to do my banking with Chase Bank on this tablet, again free.  I have downloaded the Pandora App (again free).  Talking about impressive.  The sound is great, especially with the headphone attachment included.  Enjoying Pandora itself is enought to be impressed with this tablet alone.  f you have a cell phone, you can use the Google Phone App (free)to receive and make all your phone calls on this tablet.  Google Phone even transcribes your conversations so you can have a hard copy of what was said.  Skype App (free) is also included.  You can make video phone calls once yuo download the software and purchase a Skype phone number.  And all of this works.  It comes with an attachment that allows you to connect directly to USB hardware.  I have not tried it yet, but I can only imagine the number of hardware that I will attach to this tablet, including external speakers with an external power supply,  my full keyboard, a USB hub so I connect more than one piece of hardware at a time (again with an external power supply), my mouse, and even an external hard-drive with its own power supply.  And when I want to just carry the tablet with me, I can disconnect all of this hardware and have all the computing power I need for most of my applications.  When I tell you this tablet is awesome, it is truly awesome.  I can do everything on it that I would do on a regular computer, laptop or stand-up.  I must say that the processing speed will not be as fast as a laptop or stand-up, but I have not used any applications where I noticed the speed to be a problem, not yet!!  I am even thinking of attaching a second external wireless adapter to extend the range of the Wi-Fi.  Talking about a great computer, this is a great computer.  Who would expect to able to do all of this with a tablet.  I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a compact computer. that is easy to carry yet powerful enough to do most of your computing needs.  It is extremely powerful, and the screen resolution and icons are beautiful.  I would give it 10 stars if I could.  A great buy.  My best buy on Amazon since I started shopping on Amazon over 10 years ago.  And the price is more than reasonable.  I think anyone who takes the time to learn to use this tablet will be just as impressed with it as I am.  Cudos, Marvelous, Wonderbar, Fanterrific, Wondermous, Fantabulous, Excellentaprimo, and so many other adjectives that cannot come close to how impressed I am with this tablet.  A definite jewel in the rough!!!  I will write a follow up in the future to let you know if all of these external attachments will work.  But I don't see why they wouldn't.

The screens aren't very sensitive.  I realize that screens can be too sensitive but I shouldn't have to jam my finger on the screen to get it to respond.  Very annoying.3.) Low quality graphics -- honestly, I didn't expect much from a $70 tablet, but just thought I would let you know. It's no ipad or Kindle with the graphic quality.4.) Battery life. .... It. Dies. FAST.  I was just TRYING to download a game on one, it gave me the \"You're at 14% notification\" and literally less than 5 minutes later when I went to plug it in, it was already down to 9%. This is supposedly a brand new tablet.  We literally got it in the mail yesterday. (Please note that we've had the other one for several weeks, so I'm not writing this review without having used this.)5.) Very cheaply made.  The Power Off button feels like it's going to fall off it's so loose. The camera is crooked and my daughters pad is coming apart in the middle. When I say \"very,\" I do mean VERY cheaply made.6.)  The \"User Manual\" is supposedly written in \"English\" however, it doesn't even make sense.  Here is a sentence from the \"User Manual\"  \"#3 Check the music file wherther damaged. Try playing other music, if the file have damaged may lead to serious noise or hop sounds.\"  ---that is letter-for-letter.  Huh?If you're wanting a serious tablet.  Avoid this one. I only gave it a star, because I had to. Like I said, the kids don't complain - they are just happy to have a tablet but I am not satisfied and would not use this for myself.  If I had purchased this for myself, I would have returned it immediately.

When it arrived I rushed to get it set up and download a ton of apps so my son could play with it as soon as he opened it. It was very easy to use although the downloading did take a while. Took approximately 10-15 mins to down load each app and I had purchased about 60 apps (along with some children's kindle books). This was fine since the tablet is priced under $100 (what did I expect, really).My sole issue with this tablet is with the charger. It does not charge well or quickly with the USB cord and the wall charger is difficult to work with. The charger plug does not fit completely into the port so I'm constantly trying to stop myself from shoving it in further. Also, if the plug is not positioned in the port exactly right the unit will not charge. I end up twisting and turning, and wiggling the plug around while constantly checking to see if the tablet is indeed charging. It's a little annoying. If it at least had an LED light that would blink or light up when the unit was charging, I would like it a lot better.Overall, it is a nice tablet especially considering the price. If I could do it over, I would probably purchase the same one again. I may look into purchasing a different charger that might fit the unit better. I did have to purchase a separate MicroSD card since only 40 of the 60 apps I purchased fit onto the tablet. But that was only an extra $20 or so.

Not acceptable no matter how inexpensive it was.The other thing that I noticed is that one of the tablets (though they were identical) did NOT have Zeepad branding, it was a generic of a generic, nothing to cry about since as I said before they were identical in every other way.The packaging and contents are also of a generic caliber.  One came with earphones and a cheap sylus, the other came with a cheap stylus/pen and a screen protector.Another thing that really bothered me was the jailbroken state they are in.  Makes me wonder about the legitimacy of the company. I can't say that the software was \"stolen\" because Android is largely open source however it did seem to be a bit janky and illegitimate.One tablet was in an Asian language with little hope to change it to english, fortunately I'm used to android and it's icons so I was able to make it through.Overall it just wasn't worth it for me to keep them, Got them on Friday, sent them back today.  Decided to get my babies a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 instead.  They are worth the extra hundred bucks a piece :).If you order this your mileage may vary depending on your expectations of course.

I had it for 3 days before I sent it to my grandparents and ended up being unable to use the device because the screen wouldn't turn on or off. The button seemed really loose. So, I pulled it apart and needed to adjust the button mechanism on the motherboard.

My must-have feature was the ability to do Skype calls and it worked pretty well. It comes with the real Google Play Store, so it would be easy to install your favorite applications. Here some points to ponder:- Only front camera for video calling. The resolution is pretty decent, though the camera application was very basic. Fixed installing another app from the Play Store.- No GPS.- The items on the screen \"stretch\" when tablet is held vertical. No big deal, but I think that means it would be better to use it only in horizontal orientation.- Also, when transitioning (moving the tablet) between horizontal & vertical, the screen gets a little crazy swapping from vertical to horizontal. It calms down when stabilized.- Highly recommended to install the adhesive screen protector immediately after opening. Got some scratches for normal use.- Tested Skype and Youtube and both worked fine.- I couldn't test the ports or the USB cable. Adhesive screen protector and a stylus are included.EDIT: My brother told me they are having problems leaving Skype enabled all the time. I don't know what happens but it shows as if in disconnected status. Also, it seems the volume of the speakers and the sound quality is very low when in a call, compared to a Galaxy Tab 2. I assume it would be better to use headphones.EDIT2: Now that I have it back and using it everyday, I can say that is slow. I guess this is related to the small memory (512Mb). When browsing, switching between applications, or using an app constantly, it gets slower. Sometimes I get the msg saying that an app has stopped, but I just choose \"Wait\" and soon it gets back again. I've installed a memory management app so when the memory usage falls below 25% I run a \"quick boost\" to recover control. I'm using it mostly to watch Netflix in my bed (with headphones of course, as I said the speakers are awful), and it works pretty fine. Also, on the PROS side, is pretty tough; it has fallen a few times, and stands the beats as a champ. I tried to use a microSD card to free storage space, but it couldn't recognize it, don't know if the beats have something to do. The battery life is normal and the wifi reception is good.In summary, again, is pretty decent for the price but as it needs some maintenance, I would say is not recommended for a non-tech person.

Pay attention to the delivery date.  It still came 10 days earlier than promised.  I only mention this because I didn't pay attention and wondered when it would show up.  Anyway I have an HP iPaq PDA that holds a lot of my day to day info and it is not getting younger. I don't want the data on my smartphone as I don't want it hacked.  I need to replace the PDA before it dies.  Looking at replacement costs was eye opening to say the least, 500 smackers.  Forget about it.  Then I thought, hey get a 7\" tablet, bigger screen and lots of apps.  I didn't want anything too expensive as it would be an offline one or two use device.  I saw that the Zeepad had a lot of good reviews and got one.  I've had it for several weeks and have punched a lot of data into it.  It is slow and punching data in is time consuming as sometimes the character doesn't register.  But for my purposes, I don't care as I will be inputting once and reading hundreds of times.  As I said slow, you click and then wait 3 or 4 secs but I am a very patient person and it doesn't bother me that much, though I gave 4 stars because of it.  The charger's plug to the tablet is longer than the socket on mine so it doesn't fit all the way in but it charges.  Do not force the plug into socket or you may break it.  One review says the prongs to the wall socket broke, I checked to see if mine were loose and I recommend you do the same.  Bottom line, this is an $80 tablet not a $200 tablet and you have to expect it will not work the same.  If you are looking for an all around excellent, fast 7\" tablet get the Kindle Fire, if you need it for a one or two use device I recommend the ZeePad.", "Date": "February 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great value!!", "Author": "Ashton Brereton", "ReviewID": "R3DP8OKRDZPNEK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted a fully functional tablet that would allow me, wirelessly, to access the internet, check and write emails, and access files on computers on my home network - from anywhere in or around my home - at a price below $100.

The only reason I don't give it five stars is that it does not have a backward facing camera - so I can't can't scan documents. The front-facing camera works perfectly. So, in sum, I recommend it unreservedly - at the price.UPDATE:I have been using the Zeepad more often now and found that the built-in browser was somewhat slow - taking seconds to access main pages for sites such as CNN, NBC and BBC - and occasionally the browser froze. So, I installed Opera Mini for tablets (free) and found the increase in speed of access to web pages was dramatic. Access is now in less than a second, the formatting of the pages was changed to suit the Zeepad screen, the font size was automatically increased, scrolling is a breeze and all the stories and information are available.

Displaying album art is non existent as well as even the song names.  if you click out to look at another album, you better go brew a coffee and take a shower, it might be ready when you get back.  This was not a symptom of Google's app either as all the other music players I tried had the same issues.On top of that turning it on and off is a problem, after it goes into sleep you have to hold the button for 30-60 seconds for it to reboot, it will not turn back on after it shuts down the screen like all other tablets do.

It beats any other digital photo frame I've found for less than four or five times the price.", "Date": "March 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "cheap and not well made", "Author": "Melissa @ just one opinion \"mel\"", "ReviewID": "R2R15MQU2A4RE3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I wrote this post months ago for my blog after buying the zeepad I'm not the type of person to just blast a company but I am so sad, frustrated and had my limit with the Android Zeepad 7.0 Tablet PC. My kids have had these tablets a week one of the chargers is broken (yes already) The tablet freezes if it works at all, the volume is bad I can't even explain to you... Nothing works! So I go to the manual which is a joke to call it that... as only one of the Zee-pads came with the \"manual\" which is written in broken English to the point it's hard to even comprehend what there trying to say. The tablet is a cheaply made Chinese product missing its correct accessories.. And so I contact the \"seller\" to finally get a reply after chasing butt for days. Oh they will take it back but I have to pay for shipping, I can't get a refund but an exchange after fees and only if they deem no damage was inflicted on the tablet...At this point I can't even cope with this, the tablets are horrible! My kids are in tears and I have no answers for them. I refuse to waste any more money on these things after the $153 to buy them.. I try and refund with Amazon but see here is the catch they were opened ( yes well hello how was I meant to know they where broken) and Amazon only fulfilled shipment so of course I'm stuck with the seller who has no number for me to call. USA wholesale you suck what kind of company doesn't even have a contact number? I can't tell you how bad I feel for my children.. Money does not grow on trees it's not like I can just replace these. I advice anybody considering a tablet for your kids to stay clear of these... iPad, kindle, Nook etc is the way to go...

I am so disappointed and frustrated with this purchase that I wanted to submit a review to save others the time, hassle and money. The first problem occurred when I attempted to read the user manual before doing anything with the tablet. It was horrific! The manual was written with english words but the grammatical errors, spelling errors and everything else about it was so poor that I couldn't make sense of it. It was like reading a different language with english words. Once I let it charge for the day I gave it a try, only to be completely disappointed! I realize I didn't purchase an iPad so I was willing to give it a chance. I tried to play a netflix from it only to find that I could hardly make out the image on the  screen. I also had to hold the tablet at one exact angle in order to even see anything. The sound was so poor I couldn't tell anything was even coming out of the speaker until I turned it over and held it right up to my ear. (That was after I had turned up all of the sound). The final complaint and what lead me to my decision to return it, (as if the above is not enough) is that there is such a delay when pressing an icon that I felt like I had to keep pushing it to make sure it was recognizing my touch. Actually, I can't say there is anything good about this tablet. Buyer beware, Do NOT but this! I don't even want to give it one star.

The screen cracked and it completely stopped responding to touch.  I sent it back for an exchange, but was only able to get a refund.  In less than a week, I had to return my grandson's tablet as well.  After the first couple of days, the screen turned all blue and it stayed like that for at least 2 days.  It eventually came back to life, but that only lasted for another day before it was completely gone.  So after less than 7 days, I arranged to send his back for a refund as well.The reasons I gave it a 3 star rating instead of one star has nothing to do with the product itself, although the colors are rather cute.  But it has more to do with the excellent customer service regarding order processing, shipping/delivery, and returns/refunds.  Delivery was very quick and refunds were issued immediately upon Amazon receiving the defective items, which only took a couple of days.", "Date": "January 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good tablet for the price", "Author": "Elaine Jordan \"elaine\"", "ReviewID": "R2QBBVHZIUDH5B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My husband wanted a small tablet for reading library books and kindle books at night.this was perfect.he uses his bigger tablet for everyday,but for travelling,uses this one more and more.

He had several educational apps on it, including flashcards. He is learning different vegetables, body parts, instruments, animals, along with other information that a child of the age of 2, usually does not learn.

I didn't want to spend a lot of money in case she broke it or didn't take care of it, so after looking on here and reading all the reviews I bought her this one. I gotta say I was really surprised with this because I was expecting it to be on the lower quality side because of the price. But it's actually really nice. Have a lot of pros and some cons for this tablet:Pros:-Very heavy duty but still light weight which I like. Seems like it'll last longer and it doesn't seem like it'll break easy if dropped.-Came with a bunch of stuff including charger, stylus, headphones and 2 USB chords-Very easy to set up WiFi and all the time/location settings.-Going between screens, closing out programs and personalizing tablet is super easy to do.-WiFi connectivity is great and have had no problems connecting to the house router and actually picked up a ton of other routers in the area too when it was searching for connections.-Touch screen works great. Using the stylus works even better.-All apps seem to work well - liked how there were a lot already installed like YouTube and Angry Birds.-Big pro for me was that you can turn this tablet off and on to save battery life. And it doesn't just go into \"sleep mode\" like the ipad, it actually turns off which is very nice.-Like how there's a slot for the SD card to add more storage to device.-Camera seems to work great. Can take pictures or record video and switch between the dual cameras. (Resolution is meh though - see below in 'Cons')-Charging is actually really quick. Takes maybe an hour or so to get the battery up to 100% once it's down to nothing.-Gets all the same apps as the iPad using the Google Play store (pretty much it's just like an Android phone but bigger and you can't make phone calls)Cons:-Will lag if you have too many programs open at the same time (which makes sense as the memory isn't that high).-Speakers aren't all that great. I think that's why they included the headphones because the highest volume is still kind of hard to hear sometimes depending on what you're listening too.-Resolution is alright. Not as good as the ipad or Windows tablet though. But it's not horrible, just not HD or anything.I'd definitely recommend this for a kid that wants a tablet.

Unlike other ZeePads with Android ICS, this updated model was NOT rooted out of the box.The first thing I did to prep this for her was to root it using \"Root with Restore by Bin4ry\", from the XDA forums, and then installed Ad-Away and Root Cleaner.  I also uninstalled the apps and games she doesn't use to free up some memory - root not required.Battery life is so-so.  A couple hours of gaming will kill it, but it lasts a decent amount of time for other tasks.  The back of the tablet does get quite warm while gaming.  Performance is decent, however a task killing app is useful for freeing up some memory.  The screen is OK as well and responds to touch accurately.  The viewing angle is quite limited compared to a high end IPS display, though the update speed is plenty fast for her games and doesn't exhibit motion blur.I didn't find any Chinese spamware on this tablet as I did on the Star N9500 phone that I purchased and reviewed here on Amazon.UPDATE 02-20-2014: The tablet has degraded substantially with light use.  Random lockups, reboots, green lines on the screen and other anomalies make it pretty much unusable.  I even flashed the latest stock firmware, and without any additional apps installed the same problems are present, indicating hardware failure.", "Date": "September 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Mixed feelings", "Author": "Wayfinder", "ReviewID": "R1CVI842HDPYEN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I hate writing this kind of review, because I don't know whether to review the product or the advertising/shipping.  So, giving it 3 stars as a \"belated thumbs up\".THE PRODUCT.  The Zeepad itself is fairly awesome.  It's decently fast.  Decently responsive.  I like the way Android is set up on it-- not a bunch of extra brand-specific garbage.  Easy to use.  Speaker is acceptably loud.  No bluetooth but that's as advertised.  Love the multi-function USB port.  Love that it charges either from the charger port or USB.  For the price, this is an impressive little tablet.  Didn't like the 800x400 screen pixels... too few really.  But it works and aside from typical \"short freeze\" lag factors common in Android devices, this is a great little system at $70.  The device itself I give a solid 4+ stars.THE SHIPPING and ADVERTISING.  Not so spiffy.  The ad seems to change from time to time and what was originally listed as \"up to 1200 x 600 graphics resolution\" turned out to be significantly less.  In truth, 800x400 just doesn't quite cut it.  It limits the number of icons one can have on one screen.  Now if that had been advertised would be fine.  Noticed at times the screen says just that.  But at other times it advertises the 1200 x 600 and (while I don't know why), that's going to cause problem expectations.But the real problem I had (and what knocked this down to 3 stars), when purchased from \"WorryFree Gadgets\"... it came shipped in its own box loose-packed inside an Amazon box-- no padding to keep it from bumping around.  Meh, these packages take quite a bit of bumping anyway, so not too worried.  But... Amazon box was in fine shape while the Zeepad box was significantly crushed.  Since the outer box was fine, that means it was PACKED in that condition.  As a result while the Zeepad itself seemed okay, the screen protector packed as a \"bonus item\" in the top of the box was also crushed.  Not happy with that.The bonuses were nice.  The Zeepad stylus, the screen protector (if it hadn't been damaged *at the time of shipping*), the mini-usb adapter, everything was fine.  But I don't have much tolerance for a merchant taking a visibly and significantly damaged box and going ahead and shipping it without even inspecting the contents.  That's lazy and it's just not right.So... three stars.  Like other users I give the Zeepad itself a thumbs-up value-for-the-buck rating.  For the shipping and merchant care, not so much.  The question I have:  was it shipped directly from the merchant or from Amazon itself?  The screen said \"Sold by Goodios and Fulfilled by Amazon.\"  So which is it... Worry-Free Gadgets, Goodios or Amazon to blame for shoddy packing?  Who crushed the inner box and who sent it out in that condition?  Dunno.  It got it returned though, and Amazon was great about that as always... with a refund to my account in less than 24 hours and free UPS pickup (just cannot beat Amazon on customer service).This is a product that cannot be exchanged, only returned.  That's fine because in truth, I want a bit better resolution screen if available-- and the new Zeepads are just now hitting the market with DOUBLE THE MEMORY for about $10 more (nice coincidence there).Despite the problems I still <3 Amazon, and the Zeepad is everything everyone raves about.

I wasn't sure I'd like, or need a tablet and didn't want to spend a lot of money trying to find out.I purchased the Zeepad in January. It had ok reviews, and the price was good.The good:CheapWorked fine for the games installed.Worked with Google PlayWorked as a decent, but not great, e-reader.No problems with connecting to Wi-Fi or using the SD card.The bad:The charger was bad out of the box. (Luckily charged through the USB slot).It bricked just past 6 months. (It wasn't rooted, and only had a handful of apps installed.)Slow and would lag on internet.Took time to render pdf pages.Not much information on how to unbrick online.Would I get another one? No. Was I happy with it while it worked? Mostly. I was mainly using it as a reader and even though it would lag rendering pages, it worked for what I needed. It never lagged during any of the simple games (Fruit Ninja/Angry Birds), but would bog down on youtube and other internet things.I'm now looking to replace it with a first generation Nexus tablet, or something similar. If I can unbrick it, I'll put it into the hands of the kids, but if not I didn't spend a fortune on finding out that yep, I did want a tablet.", "Date": "August 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cool", "Author": "Ayanna Wickham", "ReviewID": "R3DT63Y4GBPVJL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a cool tablet for my daughter.

It was only $70 and most tablets are hundreds. However, it came quickly, in the pink color I asked for. When I first plugged it in to charge (it says to charge first), I was concerned that it wasn't charging properly because the icon didn't show the charging symbol for more than a second or so. However, it did charge and I've downloaded several apps and have been using it. It's the perfect size (to me) because it isnt so big that it is cumbersome and it isn't so small t hat it is annoying. My only complaint is that it doesn't hold a charge for too long (about 2 hours). So as long as you remember to charge it, you are fine. I imagine my daughter will physically break it if I don't get a case for it, but that isn't zeepads fault. I sort of want one myself. OH.....I got the single camera.

My wife and I debated getting our 4 year old a LeapPad for educational games, but I was able to win out by pointing out the cost of many Android games: free.The screen has a small viewing angle and the resolution isn't the best, my daughter loves playing the ABC and puzzle games we downloaded for her. I have not purchased any software for her, but the free games on Play are awesome. This thing even runs Candy Crush (just in case you were wondering :).I wish this didn't have a proprietary charging end on it (it has a USB port, but that is not for charging) but my other tablets also have proprietary charging ports so it seems to be standard for them to make a different port.The box was full of goodies: charging cable, usb adapter (so you can plug in full sized usb items to the tablet), a stylus, AND a screen protector. They really delivered on the packaging.This tablet is really a bargain for the price, it wont win any processor speed awards and it can hang at times but if you are in the same boat and looking for something to entertain your children during long drives or you want to use some type of electronic game/learning system this is priced to be in your top 5 list of purchase considerations. On the other hand, if you are an adult looking for something to surf the web/look for jobs/ do any type of professional work with, I would suggest a different more powerful (and likely expensive) tablet.Willie-B", "Date": "June 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for kids", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"JT\"", "ReviewID": "R1HJVM1FB2GU6G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is great for my grandson with downs syndrome.

So they have been through more than six months of regular use. For $70 these are pretty good. They are definitely not iPads, Google Nexus, or Samsung Galaxies, but they are a good buy for your average 4 to 8 year olds. At this point, three of the four are still working and two of the four are working well. They work well for playing games, reading ebooks, watching movies, or taking silly (albeit low quality) pictures of oneself. They do all this just as well a Nexus.About two months ago one the tablets stopped charging, the battery still had a small charge (not enough to power up) and the charger was working. Something stopped working in the charging circuits on the motherboard. So that one is no longer usable.All but one of the chargers has stopped working, I think the wire or plug is too weak and broke, they worked if you wiggled the plug. Also the charging receptacle in the tablets is weak, one tablet's does not work anymore. And the USB port of another does not work. This has probably as much to do with the kids jamming and yanking on the cord, as anything.Fortunately, the USB connector does charge the tablet, so even without any of the chargers you can still use the tablets.The third tablet is very slow to react when tapping on the screen. This is most noticeable on the home screen, but also when playing games, though not as bad.Very odd, seems more of a software based problem than hardware.The fourth tablet, so far (knock on wood) is working fine no problems at all. Battery life has never been that great, two hours or so max. It hasn't diminished in six months so they are good quality, just not that big. Keep a smart phone charger on hand and they will last as long as you've got gas in the car.Overall, I am pleased with these tablet. Especially for younger kids, when you don't want to throw a lot of money down the drain (literally!) Trust me, I know, before they got these, my wife's Nexus, ended up in the toilet when two kids tried to grab it at the same time. Fortunately, it still works fine.We know they can take care of them now, so we will upgrade them one at a time, as they stop working. So far only one has had to be replaced.

It has a rubber bottom that is used on the screen and it has come apart. No big deal use your fingers. There are no set parental controls on it, but my husband went on google and manually set controls for graphic material. So you can set controls it just takes a bit to do.

(Just wanted to say that before anyone jumps down my throat) Bought for my mom, who has cancer and lives with me. I handled it mostly to help her set it up and we noticed problems right off the bat. We weren't expecting anything fancy, but to work and be able to get some use out of it would have been appropriate for the price paid I think. We charged it to full first thing, set it up a little bit, turned it off with the charge at 74 percent and turned it back on 30 minutes later to discover the battery had completely drained. To our disappointment, it does that every time. The touch screen is unresponsive at times especially in certain areas, you have to press really hard and sometimes even then it does not respond. There are specks in the back of the lcd screen, enough to be bothersome when using. My mom is too polite to want to return it when I mentioned it she said no, she already threw out the box it came in anyways and said it'll be alright and she feels bad. At first it was extremely slow to charge, taking hours to just get even halfway, and sometimes after it has been charged all the way and she disconnects the charger the full charge goes right back down to only a barely charged within seconds without doing anything. I have been trying to contact amazon's customer service, I remember years ago they had the best customer service if ever there was a problem, now I can't even get ahold of them. I don't have a phone with minutes right now but have been trying to submit their online forms and have been getting a \"We're sorry. There was an error trying to send your e-mail. Please try again in a few minutes or contact us by phone.\" Message. I have been trying several times a day everyday, it doesn't look like they are fixing the form problem. I have scoured the internet for their customer service address but it seems like all of them have been disabled. Extremely disappointed with this product and with amazon's customer service, they lost a long time customer.

Once we received the item, I was very happy with how easy it was to start using and the speed of the apps, specifically Netflix, as my kids watch their favorite shows on it.  And then it went downhill.  I had this product LESS THAN ONE WEEK when it completely stopped working. We used it to watch a movie on Netflix one evening.  I turned it off after using it and we went to bed.  The next afternoon, I attempted to turn it on so we could watch a movie since it was raining.  And nothing.  Would not turn on. I tried charging the tablet and nothing worked.  Needless to say, I was less than pleased.  What pushed me over the dissatisfaction edge is that when returning this item, I had to pay for return shipping; that shipping (since it is international) costs me $26.  So not only am I currently out the money I spent on the item, I am now out an extra $26 because I was sent a defective product.

ANTIVIRUS AS SOON AS U GET TABLETThe tablet comes installed with games and 2 of the games came up as potentially threatening so if u just hand it to your kid and they try to play those games u are at risk I use avg pro its still$15 bucks but I have it installed on 4 devices so worth the money u can get it in the play store this tablet is awesome but an adult should go thru all the settings and run spywear b4 handing it over to kids as I said in my updates whoever rooted the device changed the settings if u run avg it will walk u thru the settings at the end of the scan to protect your deviceI bought this tablet for my 18 month old daughter because she is determined to keep up with her older brothers and loves all the learning apps available for young toddlers I must say this tablet is great for her im going to try to find a kid tuff case of course the tablet is on the cheaper side I only paid 76 bucks im not complaining all the apps work and this tab has options to delete installed apps and options to move apps to sd card I did not have those options on my galaxy so not bad at all shes gonna be so excited to play her word games when she wakes up from naptimeUpdateJust realized this tab comes rooted I know this is a high selling point for some it makes me a little nervous but so far so good I will update again if anything else pops upUpdateSo my daughter loves it the abc phonics games are a must for anyone with young toddlers the zeepad is definatly great so far of course the speakers suck and itscheap plastic its only $76 bucks I recommend going thru the settings whoever rooted it set those kind of weird still tweaking them my daughter doesnt want to let go of the thing its great for kids and budgets I cnt afford an ipad and if I could im not handing It to my child so this is a great way for u to let your youngster play without losing out on $500 or more if they drop itUpdateDay 2 with the zeepad the charger works its battery life definatly isnt great and it depletes even when your not using the tablet but I also believe those small annoyances to be the reason the zeepad is available for such a cheap price its a wonderful beginner tablet for young kids it comes already installed with kids games and is obviously intended for kids but as I said before if your on a budget an adult could find this useful also its not the fastest or the best thats why its so cheap but its still more than enough for my daughter to watch her shows and play her apps I would definatly recommend this tablet to others great purchaseUpdateThe tablet is still working despite the fact my 18 month old has been drooling and pushing on the screen a little harder than I like then again I bought her the zeepad so she wouldnt abuse my galaxy anymore so I guess I shouldnt complain reading the reviews are what helped me make my purchase and they are also how I determine what seller to purchase from that is ehy I keep updating I feel like this tablet is a good deal if u purchase from a reliable seller and supervise your kids charge it for them its not a tank they can still break it make them sit on the couch while they play it instead of running with it this tablet is cheap and has tons of features but its not durable or it would cost more if u want durable spend $100 more bucks and u will get higher quality this is a great beginner tablet its still quite fast for a single core processor and has tons of features runs netflix youtube and my comcast apps all fine on comcast I have to log out then back in somtimes for it to work but for it $76 delivered its not that big of a deal plus u can install apps that require root access my tablet doesnt do that and to buy higher end rooted tablets is at least $100 more on top of what the going price is so im assuming the negative reviews are the people who bought from the seller at the very bottom offering the dual camera on the probably fake zeepadsUpdateIts been a couple weeks now the zeepad is still charging and works great I only charge it about once a week but I also shut it off when my daughter isnt playing it I think this was a great deal my daughter loves it and it plays all her movies and games without any problemsUpdateThe zeepad is still working just got done loading a bunch of free mp3 songs for my daughter off of the free app I got off google play I really dnt understand all the bad ratings for my$76 bucks this is an amazing deal we have 3 samsung galaxy tab2 also and this tablet does just as much a little slower at times and not as good quality but for the price this is a great dealUpdateSkype works and all of the other apps we have loaded on here just got done reading elmo and dora ebooks we downloaded on the kindle app I still cnt figure out why people dnt like this tablet I'm writing my review on it rn the battery isn't that bad and why would u want your child playing 5hrs of games a day anyways either way zeepad still works and we still love it", "Date": "March

address was incorrect. I chatted with Amazon and they sent a request to Draco Tek. I also sent an email to Drack Tek and they responded within 48 hours...I was impress with the seller and Amazon for helping me correct the shipping address. I purchase this item on March 9,2013 I received this item on March 23, 2013 sooner than promised. I brought this product for my grand-daughter she is 4 years old and is very savvy with my iPad 4. I brought this product for the price and for what it can do. I was some what disappointed because when I received this product everything was their except the stylus pen, the box came with 3 different type of chargers. One was USB, AC adapter and one for using a flash drive. The USB and AC Adapter does not work I tried it and the charge stayed at 1%. So I tried a different USB and it started charging so I left it to charge overnight. I tried it the next day and it did not charge more than 2%. The product request that you charge it the first time 6 hours...so I was disappointed that I still could not use this item. So I tried another charger that I had and this charger was charging I started charging at 9:00am and it was fully charged be 2:00pm.  Finally I was able to see what this could do and so far it works okay. I know folks say this was inexpensive...however you should always receive what the seller is selling and the item should do what the product states it should do no exceptions.  I brought this base on what the product offered. Money should not be a factor...just because some items cost more does not make them a better product. I could send this product back after all if the product cannot work because you cannot charge it then it is no good to you...major flaw. I think Drakco Tec Store which is located in China should read their customers reviews. I did read the reviews and had mixed emotions. Being a buyer at Amazon and trusting Amazon I took a chance. I have purchased a lot on Amazon since March 9,2013 and I'm learning a lot about the sellers and shipping. I what have rated this product higher because it does work and it is a good buy...however not being able to charge this item is very huge for me. Please take the time to read all reviews...their was a lot to read. I read all of the reviews after ordering. So I did know there was a possibility that the charger would not work. So I did gather up all of the old chargers I had collected over the years from old cell phones which save the day...so in the end it did work out. I will do a much shorter review after using the product longer.", "Date": "March 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great value for the price especially.", "Author": "David Draper", "ReviewID": "R1G5X6XLOLHIAP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "works really well, for the price i am extremely happy.

A plus is that it comes with a screen protecting sheet(that you have to apply) but its one less thing you need to worry about buying and if you are looking at this guy, you value saving some $$. The plastic cover is quite solid but the edges do scuff up pretty quick. The battery lasts about 2 hours and that is acceptable for the price. If you are thinking about using this as a PC substitute please keep in mind that after the OS you only have about 1.9Gbs of space left; bought a 32Gb microsd from scandisk and the system recognized it right away; but only as a 29.8Gb device(might be file system configuration, but that's enough space for me. It comes with angry birds and fruit ninja installed and it was a great excuse to have some random children play with it and although they handled it as if it was made of solid titanium; it came out with minor scratches, but non on the screen because of the protector.The major down side for this device is the charger; as noted before it doesn't fit all the way and most of the time you have to \"giggle\" it around so that it will start charing; but the usb cable charges perfectly, just takes longer; I get a full charge from 2% to 100% in about 15 minutes on wall charger and about 23 on usb.I would have given it a 5, had it come with bluetooth or at least gps support.

That was my first mistake not reading thoroughly as I usually do and not buying within the United States. The tablet was slow doing anything,the battery life seemed to be short,there is no reset button to try. The settings menu for example looking up battery use you couldn't tell where you stood it says like 40% and then it would die. But, that wasn't the biggest issue as had it for a month and now it's completely dead. Now, if we go with just a bad tablet it happens and or something about the seller and overseas I can't answer about this tablet as it gets rave reviews which is why I bought it. One big positive I can say is the Amazon A-Z Guarantee. Make sure you have it. I asked them to step in when I was only having trouble before totally dying and I believe in less than 24 hrs. it was resolved and I received a full refund.  Another big positive to have on electronics from Amazon is the Square Trade Warranty. It's worth the extra money. I have had to use it in the past on another item and that is also everything you read on reviews. Easy,fast,amazing. Trying to be fair.

We have a 5 year old boy and a 10 year old girl. Upon reading other reviews that these might be somewhat fragile, we have drilled into the kids that they need to be gentle with them. In general, these work just like a Droid smart phone and last a couple of hours before they need to be recharged. As we don't really want the kids playing games longer than this, we are fine with the batter life. The Google Play Store works just like on a smartphone and we have had no issues with this or using the wifi. I added a couple of leftover mini SD cards I had from old smart phones to increase the storage space for the kids.The only issues we have had with these tablets have all been in with either the original seller (not Goodios) or the quality control of the product. We originally ordered these 15 days before christmas to be from Santa. These never arrived, Amazon refunded our money and that company is no longer in business. Beware of the folks with the cheapest price. We then re-ordered these from Goodios who have been perfect in solving our problems. Our first set of these arrived and one of them was dead on arrival. It was quickly replaced with another that had a bad charger. We had a new charger within a couple of days and then found out the little USB connector was also defective. They sent us one of those and now everything works fine.We got the little USB keyboards that double as covers which work fine with one exception. When the Zeepad is in the case and the case is turned vertically the Zeepad can slip out of the little claws that hold it in. As these cases are all made the same I will put either double sided tape or some velcro on ours to keep this from happening.We really like these tablets and they kids have been using them up everyday when they get home from school for over a month. If Zeepad improved their quality control we would have had no issues with them at all. The 4 stars are because of this.

Plus when I contacted the seller & told them I'd lost my stylist & ruined the screen protector they mailed/shipped me replacmemts free of cost. Overall, great product!If you wanted to get a keyboard for your tablet I left the link below they have black, red, pink, blue, and purple listed.LINK:7\" Tablet Stand with USB Keyboard - Black Faux Leather Carrying CaseKeybord- I bought for my zeepad and works great. It's not blue tooth, but even with blue tooth you have to be ale to see what your typing, so it's not like you can be typing in the other room, so it's the same thing basicaly unless you have to have something else plugged up at the same time. It comes with the usb to plug into the usb that the zeepad comes with so u have everything to do it plus cheeper with a durrable cover. I had no problems with the seller or the shipping.(shipping threw fedex)You might want to consider buying a car charger for the tablet, I bought mine on amazon.comLINK:Car DC 5V Adapter For Zeepad 7inch Android Tablet PC Power Supply Cord ChargerYou can also purchase an adapter from Wal-mart that plugs into the car to take house held items with house held chargers to plug into the adapter to make it charge in the car. I have one of these and it works with the zeepad house charger.I'm not sure why so many people leave the \"not so positive feedback\" for this product. Most of the negetive feedback came from those who ordered durring Christmass. Okay, I never order anything durring Christmass. WHY? Things get lost, misplaced, or damaged(may be the cause for those who had minor issues- package could have been dropped or slammed into another package or left in too hot or cold of environment). 9 times out of 10 it's not the company who is at fault(the postal service who is delivering the package could be) and durring Christmass their E-Mails are flooded. They may have accidently overlooked your e-mail or simply haven't gooten to it yet. Plus if your item doesn't arrive by the estimated delivery date don't panik, it's just an estimate, it may take a few more days to arrive. I orderd mine a week or 2 after Christmass and payed the extra money for \"2-3 day shipping\" and it arrived on the 1st estiamated delivery date. I didn't run into a single problem with shipping or ordering, I am sorry for those who did and I have confidence that the seller will indeed get back to you and fix any issues you may have expeirenced. I must say this couldn.t possibly be a scam because, I am a real, happily satisfied customer and I recieved a real Zeepad tablet w/ accessories, undamged and on time threw amazon.com(shipped by FED-EX).Copy of the nice e-mail conversation I experinced with the seller:Me:  Hey, I lost my pink zeepad stylist and messed up the zeepad screen protector can you send me a new screen protector and  another pink zeepad stylist? If this cost money how do i go about paying for these two items?Seller:  We only have the silver stylus pen in stock right now, is that ok?Me:  Yes, that',s fine thank you, and did you happen to have an extra screen protector as well?Seller:  The stylus pen and the screen protector will be mailed out for you today.Me:  Thank you so much! and ive tried to leave feedback but the computer wont let me every time i try but i just wanted to say thank you that I love my tablet and didnt find a thing wrong with it.Seller:  Thank you for the kind words, it is our pleasure to make our customers happy!Plus, they sent me a link so I could leave this product review.", "Date": "January 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not as advertised", "Author": "NITA MASSEY", "ReviewID": "RFKAJUKGSB8R", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "It was to have apps preloaded in it, It came completely empty and would not connect to wifi. this is my second attempt to buy one of these.", "Date": "January 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Zee pad", "Author": "Bree", "ReviewID": "R2UIBIJ60C8FBW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great product for the price .

At first I used the slide lock. Well I forgot the combination but after 3 tries it asked if I wanted to open with my google account. Nice save! So still feeling pretty sure of myself I set a password and left for work. Returning home to find her chores done, homework done and room clean  she earned play time. I have to admit that after hours of trying every combination of what I thought the password was, I was never able to unlock it.I take full responsibility for forgetting the password. I give this tablet a low rating because there is NO reset button!! Before sending back I searched for hours on the internet looking for help on how to reset it. For the money it is not a bad product and my daughter enjoyed it for her first tablet. But what are the chances that she would set a password and forget later on without any way to reset it? With the slide lock after 3 tries it did give the option to override and we were able to get in. With the password however, I tried over 300 combinations and never got the option to open with my google account. I saw many other sites with the same complaint but never found an answer. Nor was I able to find the manufacturer info to call and ask if there was a way to reset the tablet.

(Instructions indicated doing something, but the print is so small and pictures even smaller that even with 20/20 vision I couldnt figure out what it said). The touch pad isn't always all that responsive...but for the most part, it's good enough for a 12 year old. I wasn't using the stylus that comes with it at the time..but perhaps the response from the touch screen would have been slightly better if it had.Ran into some issues of it 'not responding' and not accepting my request to shut the system off to try and fix the problem - eventually I did get it to come out of it's funk and it worked just fine. But it does freeze a bit. Runs a little slow, but with only 512MB of Ram, I chalk that up to the fact it's been a while since I've worked with something with such a slow processing speed.It's a decent reader - the kid prefers the weight and size compared to that massive Nook she got from another relative for Christmas. The fact that it is PINK is possibly the biggest plus. It does run most Google Play apps - so that is a plus since they are mostly free.  The front facing camera is pretty poor quality, so that feature for Skype is there, but know it's about as good as webcams from 10 years ago.

My tech looked at it, and said the wifi card was dead, so I could buy a new one, but since it was less then 5 hours old,send it back!! NOW I did read all of the comments, and this company has a great reputation,but this product when it works for people its fantastic, when it doesn't well I had a tearful child!! So is this the sellers fault? how do i rate this with anything but a 1 when the product failed so miserably even if the seller was fine? I mean i didn't contact the seller amazon did, so im assuming they treated amazon as they would me on that note they get 5 stars, BUT again why are they not testing these tablets out, I mean its a real crap shoot when you buyt this, as you can see some people got lucky and what they bought was awesome, I gambled and lost I bought it crossed my fingers and got a defective one:( i am not going to buy another one, I'm not sure what I'm going to do but this tablet form any of the sellers is not the answer for my family!!I got to my house on time, they DO NEED to package it better!! its in a small box with no bubble wrap or packing material of any kind, and then that box is in another box,(just rattling around) this may be why some are getting cracked screens, plus it(the tablet) was ice cold, I dont know if that would break it, but I'm sure it doesn't help. Maybe that's what happened! For the person who wanted a instructional guide..I got one, it had no adjectives in it, and it didn't help with , why did the sound go out?? so you really dont need one, as everything else is pretty easy to understand, it was funny though!!SO Im giving the tablet 1 star, I rolled a dice, and the seller will get a 5 but for the purposes here, I'm giving it 1 star. So it is definitely buyer BEWARE!! ( I didn't make 2 separate reviews 1 for product 1 for the seller, so I only made this one and included everything!)

The manufacturer apparently knew this and included a screen protector.  However, the protector is of very low quality and peels off and/or develops air bubbles after a few days.One of the units had some problems with the internals and if you put your finger on back it in a specific spot it would create a distortion pattern on the screen in the front.One unit was DOA.  The touch screen had a dead spot (which happened to line up with the \"S\" key on the onscreen keyboard making it unusable.  In general, the touch screens are of low quality.  All of them have manufacturing defects like embedded dust particles in the plastic (that become evident after installing the screen protector)  indicating they were produced in a low quality facility.The power button on one of the units has already failed and no longer powers on or off the unit.The screen is a critical feature of a tablet and this one fails miserably on all counts.  It is cheap Chinese crap and should be avoided.I got frustrated and purchased a Nextbook in Walmart for the same price as one of these units and the difference in quality is astounding.

I admit there are a few things the Galaxy has as features this tablet doesnt do, but for the most part it can do all you need (unless you are a high end user).  This tab comes with just under 1gb memory onboard.  I do recommend you buy an 8gb micro SD card (TF card) to go with when ordering as most aps want to install to the card.  Set up was easy and second nature~ no having to flash the bios, or other such nonsense that many other no-name tablets had on their reviews to get Google Play (market).

They are reasonably priced, and well made, and fit our families needs.****UPDATED**** Battery expanded and after 9 mo no longer works.  The battery broke open the Tablet.  I am disappointed.

The thing is the equipment turned out to be defective tablet wont turn, the screen didn't work. So I went yesterday to the Toys R US Where I bought it the one in Hato Rey, Puerto Rico, to have it exchanged by another tablet or for a refund. And not only did I wait sooo long in line I was attended by this obnoxious assistant manager , whom which after looking @ the tablet just simply told me she couldn't accept the tablet because the manufacturing company wouldn't accept it. I told her the Tablet had arrived like this yet she didn't do much or anything to help out in this situation. All I can say is that Toys R US.. should emphasize more on customer service which is very low quality, they don't seem to hire a lot of employees although the stores are very big. Sometimes you have to walk around for a while through out the whole store in order to receive some assistance by a employee. As far as this situation I feel totally robbed/Scammed for my money. Employees are supposed to assist customers diligently and efficiently on any situation. But I just sensed they don't really care even though my daughter was next to me while I was trying to exchange the item ( Which obviously made her very sad, she wouldn't stop crying on the way back home.) I simply don't understand why wouldn't Toys R US exchange my item or give me a full refund it seems there always some sort of controversy or excuse to their own benefit  when it comes to exchanges or refunds. Other stores like Game Stop, Electronics Boutique, Wal-Mart,  Amazon won't give those obstacles when it comes to exchanging a item which they also sell a whole lot CHEAPER. Iam beyond indignated because the store manager totally wiped her butt with my receipt ( The purchase had been made less than a month ago) And even though  she did admit the Tablets were in fact coming with defects  she declined to offer any assistance or a exchange, refund, store credit whatsoever. Usually I never really buy often in Toys R Us... because there isn't located where I live & because I don't find the prices of the items cheap or affordable.. compared to Wal-Mart or K-mart or Game Stop , AMAZON . But this incident totally made it for Iam never BUYING ANYTHING ON TOYS R US ... EVER AGAIN.. and will give NEGATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS to relatives and Close ones based on my Personal EXPERIENCE.
