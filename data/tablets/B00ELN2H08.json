It will do all the cycle but reboot at the end. Also after running out of battery it will not turn on again even after charging it overnight. I left it sitting on a table and suddenly one day it turned on by itself. This part of the problem can be consider normal; after all you can have a defect in one product once in a while. The real problem lies on the fact that the company website is not even listing it as a product and when you try to contact production support, they just simply don't understand what are you talking about. As simply as that. As an example, they keep asking for IMEI and info like if it where a phone and after three emails explaining them that it is not a phone so I don't have the info they ask for and having them asking back for the same data I just quit trying to get it fixed.I bought it based on the excellent experience I had with a BLU phone, but obviously this doesn't translate to tablets", "Date": "March 31, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00ELN2H08"}}
