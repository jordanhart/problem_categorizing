I also have a laptop that I use for work and sometimes need a second monitor.  This can do it all!When I'm using my work laptop the HDMI works perfect as a second monitor and is very clear.When I'm using it as my main PC it is great because the touch screen works nice.  I also play a couple games like Sid Meier's Civilization V (Windows 8 - Touch Enabled) and Sims 3 and both work perfect.I must say that I have not used the table features all that much, but I do carry it from my home office to the dinning room table at times to play games with my family.  It is a little heavy and I don't really trust the travel bag that came with it, so I just carry it without the bag.One issue that I have is that the battery only last for a couple hours, but that isn't that big of a deal.  Especially if I'm doing something and the power flickers then I don't have to worry about losing anything or when I'm taking it from room to room I don't have to power off the thing.  I just usually have to make sure that I either make a separate trip to get the power cord or have someone else bring it with me.  I thought about purchasing a second AC adapter, but having a little trouble finding one without going directly to Lenovo.", "Date": "May 1, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00E3W5RGS"}}
