Internet browsing was frustrating. Snapchat is non-functional. Apps crash at random.In total, I may have used this tablet two days since owning it-- for over 2 months, now. I became so frustrated with the crashes and slowness that I just stopped using it. I stopped bothering to charge it. Speaking of which....The battery life is ridiculously bad. I can't imagine using this for many media applications beyond casual games like Angry Birds. Forget music or a tv show (I haven't tried loading a show on it--- it's so bad at everything else, I wouldn't want to waste the hours trying to set it up).Bottom line: you get what you pay for. And this is definitely not a product you should pay for.", "Date": "March 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good for the budget minded", "Author": "timpclimber", "ReviewID": "RK6N2W4EM6RER", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Well built, easy to up and use if you buy one with a key board case.
