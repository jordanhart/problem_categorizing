Ran fine right away.Nearly everything works fine, and fairly quickly.I'd recommend this fast & featured tablet to anyone, new-to-tablets or otherwise!Issues noted:The Manual provided is not the one for the tablet, as the printed manual shows a UI with the older Screenshot button at the bottom. I dismissed this minor detail, since the online manual is up-to-date.One (very annoying) issue with the firmware is it is completely unable to take screenshots and actually save them.The POWER+HOME keys work fine. However the firmware is unable to save the image, always sending the notification:Couldn't capture the screenshot.Couldn't save the screenshot. Storage may be in use.Which leads me to believe there's a small error in the firmware that prevents it from saving to the built-in 8GB SD.I would like to see this issue resolved, as it is important to Reporting problems.On a side note, the ematic website \"Support\" section does not have these models even listed in the menu yet, so I am writing a Review here, seeking contact about this screenshot/firmware issue.", "Date": "May 22, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$79.99", "Features": "Android 4.1 Jelly Bean, 7 inches Display\nARMv7 Dual Core 1.3 GHz\n8 GB Flash Memory, 1 GB RAM Memory\n.65 pounds", "Name": "Ematic HD Dual-Core EGD170BU 7-Inch 8 GB Tablet (Blue)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41KM7oTaWEL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00I9N4KLU"}}
