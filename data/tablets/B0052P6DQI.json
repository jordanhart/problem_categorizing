{"Reviews": [{"Title": "For me, Thrive beats Galaxy Tab and Acer Iconia", "Author": "Kaio", "ReviewID": "R1RG0JE05ECJWC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "*UPDATE 8* Now Up:  See the addendum at the end of this review.I pre-ordered the 32gb Thrive here on Amazon, but got impatient and went to a local retailer just to check them out. We loved this tab so much, we got a 2nd for my husband in 16gb.Toshiba BrandFirst off -- No -- I do not work for Toshiba. But I fell in love with the brand a little over a year ago when I bought a new Qosmio laptop, and it's BY FAR the best computer I have ever owned.  I love it as much today as the day I got it, so when I found out Toshiba had an Android Tab, I had to take a serious look.Galaxy & Iconia in BriefPrior to learning about Thrive, I was seriously considering the new 10\" Galaxy Tab.  I had been coveting the 8\" model for some time, but just wasn't ready to take the leap.  So when the 10\" came along, I just had to stop by a local retailer to try one out hands-on.  And I must say, I really fell in love with it -- the screen is vivid and stunning, the interface is clean and responsive.  And it's super thin for sure.  But, the first thing I noticed was there's no inputs of any kind; no SD slot, no USB, no nada.  The sales rep said that's because everything is trending toward the \"cloud.\"  Well, that's all well and good, but I like products that I control, not products that control me (hence why I'm no fan of Apple's line of iShackle products.  I'm all for \"the cloud\" and have one here on Amazon for my music, but I'm also the type that prefers to have my own stuff stored locally.  I also like to get into the nuts and bolts of my peripherals and use them my way, so having no inputs on the Galaxy was a huge letdown for me.  I left the store feeling underwhelmed, and like it wasn't the right time to buy a tablet.  But I was bitten by the bug so I went home and started researching other tabs.Reviews here on Amazon had me convinced Acer Iconia was better than Asus Transformer.  And the Acer had USB inputs, so I was happy with that.  But I've never been a big fan of Acer, so I still wasn't feeling the itch just yet.  But then I stumbled upon the Toshiba Thrive, and still being so highly impressed with their laptop, I immediately felt a connection to the Thrive.Every Input I'll Ever NeedThrive has SD card, USB, mini-USB and full size HDMI ports.  And for me, this is where Thrive clobbers the competition -- Toshiba just \"gets it;\" they make products that keep the end user in control and offer a truly freeing experience.  I have a full size HDMI port on my Toshiba laptop too, and let me tell you, it completely changed my computing experience!  My laptop is connected to a 50\" plasma TV and I use a wireless keyboard and gyration remote for a mouse.  Let me tell you, once you use a computer that way, there's just no going back.  So all those inputs on the Thrive was a big clincher for me -- and once again, Toshiba stands head and shoulders above the rest in this department.  I fully expect to connect my tablet to my HDTV as well.  And the on-board SD and USB ports assure I'll have all the computing freedom and control I've come to expect.Vibrant Screen and ColorWhen I first saw the Thrive at my local electronics store, I was a bit concerned the screen wasn't as vibrant as the Galaxy.  But then I remembered Thrive has an auto brightness feature, so I was wondering if that was limiting the saturation in some way.  I was easily able to find and navigate the setup menus right there in the store, turned off auto-brightness -- and voila! -- the Thrive's screen was every bit as vibrant and rich as the Galaxy!  The colors and clarity are nothing short of stunning.  I hate to say it, but the screen is probably better than my 50\" plasma (it's only a couple years old, which already makes it a relic in tech world.)Ease of UseFor me, the truest test of any piece of tech, is the ability to use it straight out of the box with NO help from user manuals.  I got a new printer recently and had to fiddle with it for days because the install didn't set it up properly -- and in my book -- that's a sure sign of a piece of junk.  This Thrive, however, was very simple and easy to get the hang of within minutes right there in the store.  Naturally, that's as much a testament to Android 3.1 as it is to Toshiba Thrive.  Either way, I was doing everything from surfing the net, to customizing the entire interface and settings in minutes, all right there in the store -- no user manuals, no nothing.  I even tethered it to my cell phone just for fun.  The interface is so smooth and responsive, and the Tegra CPU is clearly a beast; no hangs, locking or delays of any kind.  Everything was fast, smooth and clean; just the way it should be.  In fact, Thrive loaded and buffered YouTube videos better than the Galaxy, though there could be many reasons for that given all the devices on the store's WiFi network.Rubberized BackSome might not think much of this, but believe me, it's pretty awesome and makes the Thrive feel like velvet in my hands!  It also gives me confidence in the tablet's durability and build quality.  By contrast, both the Galaxy and Iconia have a hard, slick back, and as a result, I personally found them both harder to hang on to.  I'm disabled and easily drop things, so I never felt fully confident holding either the Galaxy or Iconia.  All of these tabs are just a few weeks old, and it's worth pointing out that the backs of both the Galaxy and Iconia were scuffed and scratched to the point of making them look junky.  Granted, they're both display models in a high traffic store, but the physical condition of both these tabs after only a couple weeks on display suggests one can expect the same blemishes from personal use over time.  By contrast, the Thrive's rubber backing assures there'll be no scuffs or scratches on my tab or anything I set it down on.  And if it does wear out, I can just buy a new backing in one of 6 cool colors.ThicknessYes, the Thrive is probably twice as thick as the Galaxy, but I'm ok with that.  Especially since it isn't all that much heavier.  I think the added thickness is due to the USB and HDMI inputs the Galaxy is lacking.  Personally, I'd rather have a slightly thicker tab with all the inputs I want, than a wafer thin tab that has a USB dongle dangling from it that I always have to remember to carry.  Smaller and thinner isn't always better, at least not for my taste.  I don't want a 10\" wafer thin screen that I'm scared to drop or set down anywhere, or that will easily get scratched or cracked.  The Galaxy just doesn't feel very durable, nor did the Iconia.  While the added thickness and rubberized back make the Thrive feel more durable; like it could survive being accidentally dropped, or if placed on a table, the rubber backing would help it survive minor spills.  Being disabled, I need something durable, and to that end, the Thrive feels like it will easily outlast both the Galaxy and Iconia.  And we're not talking a super thick tablet here; it's still plenty thin.  It's also very light; if not, my hands would cramp up and I wouldn't be able to grasp it to begin with.Wider Body - More To Get My Paws On!The Thrive is a bit wider than both the Galaxy and the Iconia -- the screen size is the same on all 3, but the Thrive's casing is about half an inch wider, which is great because it gives me a little more edge to hang on to without my fingers covering part of the screen.  I have big hands, so this all adds up to a good thing for me.  Overall, the Thrive just feels better in my hands, and more sturdy and durable.Screen ProtectorsI'm a fan of those \"helicopter blade\" screen protectors and have been using them on all my touch screen devices for years.  I went ahead and ordered a full body protector for my 32gb Thrive pre-order.  But after getting my hands on my husband's 16gb Thrive, I'm realizing I don't want to cover the velvety rubber back of my Thrive with a screen protector.  They haven't arrived yet, but I'm hoping we can use the back of the screen protector on the front of our 16gb Thrive (both pieces appear to be the same shape and size.  If not, no biggie, we'll just order another screen protector.  I'm a big believer in screen protection and they've saved me from accidental scratches more than once.Entertainment HubI've read that Tablets are trying to edge themselves into being the conduit that connects all your devices -- TV, cell phone, computer, etc.  And after getting this Thrive in my hands, I can see how tablets can easily fill that void.  I love my Qosmio laptop, but prefer not to take it away from home.  And my smartphone is great, but the screen is just too small to enjoy surfing the net on it.  But now with the Thrive, I can stay connected and still enjoy a full-fledged experience on the go, or even at home, all in the palm of my hands.  I've never been much into social networking, but I'm realizing that for someone with limited mobility, this might be my conduit to the outside world.  I can totally see how using this tab in a social aspect while watching TV would broaden and enhance my experience.  I just may get into Twitter too, and all that thanks to this Thrive!  Duh -- I'm starting to get why they named it that to begin with!Replaceable BatterySome people might find this meaningless.  But I just had to replace the battery in my expensive Harmony remote and it's only 2 years old.  So for me, having a replaceable battery in an expensive tablet its HUGE!  No other brand offers this but Thrive.Bottom Line -- my head is reeling a bit from the thought of owning 2 tablets.  It's really not an expense we can afford and I should probably cancel my 32gb pre-order here at Amazon or return this 16gb.  But we love it so much...  I guess we'll see what happens.  Either way, I really love this tablet and am VERY happy with it.  Every once in a while, a product comes along that fits my life like a glove.  Last time, it was Toshiba's Qosmio laptop.  This time, it's their Thrive tablet.  These are the first 2 Toshiba products I've owned, and I must say, I think Toshiba has won me over for life.  The quality, ease of use, superior construction and forward thinking innovation -- I'm sold; hands down.  There are plenty of tablets out there to choose from.  Just do your research and find the one that fits you.  For me, that's Toshiba Thrive.  I LOVE this tablet!!7/22/11 UPDATE -- Tips & Tricks:After using both 16gb and 32gb Thrive's for a couple weeks, I thought I'd add this addendum to my review:HDMI DUAL VIEWHook up the Thrive to your HDTV and the screen will display simultaneously on Thrive and your TV; Angry Birds on a 50\" plasma - FUN!  I got a 25' HDMI cable, but am looking into wireless.  Picture is stunning.  BTW -- there's a reason why HDTVs _don't_ use mini or micro HDMI -- because the signal isn't as good as full-size HDMI, and only Thrive has that capability.DON'T USE A USB HUBI've had spotty results transferring files to Thrive when plugged into a hub.  But when I plug the Thrive directly into my laptop's USB port, I've had no issues and transfers are quite fast. (Win 7 Pro 64bit)FIREWALLS CAN BLOCK APPSI was initially having problems downloading apps from the Market while on my home WiFi, but then I realized my router's firewall was blocking some of Thrive's inbound traffic. So I set up 2 simple Port Forwarding rules, and voila, problem solved.BATTERY LIFEThrive charges in a about 1 hour; slightly longer if you're using it while charging.  So far, I've been getting 14-26 hours per charge while using Thrive on and off throughout the day.  My screen is set to 50% brightness with auto-brightness turned off.  I leave WiFi on and just let Thrive go into sleep mode when not in use; naturally, the battery lasts even longer if I completely shut down at night.  Yesterday, I started the day with 50% battery life left -- I played Angry Birds for 4 hrs straight, watched YouTube for an hour, surfed the net and checked email for another hour, and read a book for 90min -- all that before the battery finally died and needed a recharge.  There's nothing scientific about my tally, but Thrive is giving me great battery life, IMO.ADOBE FLASH, FAST SURFING & PAGE LOADSSurfing the net is NOTHING like on my phone.  Web pages load as fast as my laptop and I can have several tabs open at the same time.  Fast, smooth and responsive.  Flash works great.  Haven't run into a website yet that doesn't work.EXTERNAL USB & FLASH DRIVESMake sure they are formatted with FAT (not NTFS) and you'll have no problems.  I even hooked up an external 500gb Western Digital My Passport drive with no issues.WHY 32gb IS BETTER THAN 16 or 8gbThrive comes pre-loaded with many apps; some useful, like Toshiba File Manager and Service Station; some not so useful, and they can't be deleted.  Point being -- I've never heard anyone complain about having too much HD space.  So do yourself a favor and get the largest GB you can afford.  SD cards, IMO, are for convenience, NOT for extending your storage capacity and running apps off it.  I use mine to view and transfer pics off my digital camera.FUN & HELPFUL APPS>Advanced WiFi Lock Free -- this solves the dreaded wake from sleep issue.  Go into the app's settings and UN-check \"Enable Timeout.\"  Prior to this, I experienced the issue twice, but since installing this app, the wake from sleep issue has disappeared.  I do sometimes have to push the power button twice to get it to wake from sleep.  But other than that, I don't have any complaints about how the buttons work.>Talking Panda Free -- fun for kids of all ages!>Amazon Kindle -- read your digital books on Thrive.  Just wish it had text-to-speech.>DirecTV -- program your DVR(s) on the go and never miss a fave TV program.>Angry Birds -- I never thought I'd get into this game, but it really is fun.  Rio is my favorite edition.>Paint Joy -- finger painting on your tablet.  Save, share and even watch a time-lapsed rendition of your creations; kinda fun!  Let loose your inner artist!THRIVE PORTFOLIO CASEI got this case for outings away from home.  But at home, I prefer using Thrive without the case.  The Thrive is thicker than Galaxy, but I probably would have left Galaxy in it's case, because I didn't like how slick it felt.  So Thrive without a case is about the same thickness as with Galaxy with a case.ENTERTAINMENT CENTERThrive has already become another component of my home entertainment system.  I use it simultaneously while watching TV or even surfing the net on my laptop, which is hooked up to my 50\" plasma.  The Thrive has become an addition and a natural extension of my home entertainment center.That's it for now; I'll add more in time, if I think of anything.9/5/2011 UPDATE 2 - over 2 months and still loving my Thrive.  Here's a couple extra helpful tips:HDTV VIA THRIVEWe took our Thrive on vacation with us for our anniversary (happy 21st to us!) and hooked it up to the hotel's 42\" HDTV.  Thanks to Thrive's full-sized HDMI port, we easily ran a 25' cable right to our bed and watched our fave TV shows right off the TV network's websites while connected to the hotel's free WiFi.THRIVE DOCKDo yourself a favor and get one if the expense fits your budget. It's a tad overpriced at $50 with no power supply (it uses the one that came with Thrive) but it doubles as a great lap stand and makes charging the Thrive much more convenient; just slip it in and out of the cradle.  Don't like how the adapter fits into the Thrive itself and the dock solves that problem.  Also, Thrive looks great on display in the dock too.  I suppose if you don't mind changing the screen timeout a lot, you could even use it as a digital picture frame (just be careful with that if running off the battery.  I have a review for the Toshiba Thrive Multi-Dock with HDMI too if you're interested.PORT FORWARDINGI was going to post specifics in my last update, but thought it might be different for everyone and didn't want to misinform.  But in case it helps anyone, here's how I fixed the problem I had with downloading apps from the Market on my home WiFi:I have my router's firewall set to high, and when I played around with the different security levels, I noticed the 2 that were blocking my Thrive were Real A/V port 7070 and T120 port 1503. I set 2 specific rules and opened those ports for my Thrive, and then the Market apps downloaded without issue. (these were both inbound traffic.  You have to know a little about port forwarding for this to make sense, but it's not that hard to do; a quick Google search never hurts. :-)MORE GREAT APPS> Scrabble is interesting because you can play online over time. I have 30 games going any given week. The app is a bit buggy, but it's still fun and I'm sure they'll improve on it.> Documents To Go is half off @ $7.99 in the Amazon AppStore> Twitter - works well but I'm still learning and don't tweet much, mostly follow.> Gmail comes standard with the tab. GDocs and all of Google's stuff is awesome.> GOOGLE SKY helped us find Jupiter, Mars, all the planets and stars in our solar system last night!! CQQL!!> The Kroger app lets me add digital coupons to my grocery store club card.> DirecTV Remote controls my TV's DVR; kinda neat.> Weather Bug for Honeycomb has a neat widget where you can flick up or down to change the temperature amongst your saved locations> Cloudy is a fun paper airplane game> PhotoShop Express is free and always good to have.> MXvideo Player has neat swipe controls that make it easy to forward, pause and reverse vids while they are playing.> the Bookmarks widget that comes standard with the tab lets you scroll through thumbnails of each web page.> Vevo and TV.com apps have some good content> Fruit Ninja is surprisingly fun; I like Zen Mode.  It speaks to my inner samurai.> and don't forget my all time fave: Lily The Talking Panda> All of these apps have free versions; the only one I've paid for so far is Paint Joy Pro at $1.99.> & Remember - 1 FREE PAID APP A DAY here on Amazon!That's all for now folks!;oDUPDATE 3 - 9/27/2011Over 3 months and I still L-O-V-E my Thrive!  It's a cornerstone of my entertainment experience. I do take it with me when I venture out, but home is my primary use. It is ALWAYS in my lap. Instant fit in my life and fills a void no other device can.  Perfect!Here's the latest Helpful Tips I'd like to share:Project Your ThriveI recently discovered that Thrive can be hooked up to an Epson Projector, which can be invaluable for those doing business presentations. Just plug in a standard HDMI cable from Thrive to the projector, and it will project your Android tablet onto any surface. Sure, you could do this with another tab, and HDMI dongle, or micro connection, but I never like being caught in the lurch with nonstandard cables. I've been caught more than once with a proprietary cable that's failed. I much prefer the convenience and reliability of Thrive's full size onboard ports. I have a review for the Epson Multimedia Projector on that page as well.Tablets Are Touchy-FeelyFor me, a tablet is a tactile experience, hence, external keyboards and mice are not required.  I've tried them both and found them counterintuitive.  If I want to use those things, I've got a great laptop for that.  A tablet is a device that stands on its own like no other.  It is a personal item, hence, it should feel good to hold.  It's not a cell phone.  It's not a computer.  It doesn't play by the same rules.  Quite simply, it's the most personal and indispensable component of all my tech items and fills a void no other device can.More Fun Apps:> Weather Bug for Honeycomb has changed its name to AccuWeather for Honeycomb. It's still the best weather app I found; the widget is great.> Days Left -- has a neat widget that goes on your desktop and can countdown the days to special events and occasions.> Amazon AppStore has a great app that makes it easy to shop for apps and get their Free App of the Day.> Airport Mania 2 -- has become one of my favorite games. Think Chevron Toy Cars with wings! The object is to land planes at your airport, wash, paint, load & unload packages and passengers, maintain and fuel up all the planes visiting your airport, and safely send them on their way. It's like being an Air Traffic Controller, but fun!> Word Mix -- a unique word scramble game that is addictive. You can play against the clock or Puzzle Mode.> WiFi Finder -- will find free WiFi Hot Spots in a Google Earth-type layout. It finds everything in your vicinity and maps it. Be sure to download the offline database within the app, so you can use it without a WiFi connection.> Rocket Bunnies -- If you read that title without a smile on your face, then you won't have any fun playing this game!> Prize Claw -- why waste money at a stupid machine, when you can play this for free! The teddy bears are cute, too!> Paradise Island -- think Sim City> Flying Penguin -- slide on your tummy, away from the polar bear, before he eats you up!> Fat Booth -- ever wonder what you'd look like chubby?! (or people you know or stars & celebrities)> Guinea Pig Getaway -- yes, it's as adorable as the title. Tilt and move your tablet to help guide their boat and escape the big meanie chasing them.> Foto Tiles Slideshow -- turn your desktop into a collage of personal photos that change on a timer; think digital mosaic, only it's a live desktop, not a screen saver.And last, but not least, I'd like to share a post written by Pie Grrrl, in the discussion section of this review - she had a VERY interesting conversation with some techies over at Best Buy, who gave their candid impressions about Thrive and other tablets. The direct link to her post is below. In brief, here's the just of what she learned:> All of them highly coveted the Thrive; the feel, the look and the full size ports.> All of them are gamers and mostly used their tablets at home; like I said in the review, these fill a void in everyone's home entertainment experience. Personally, I live in a bit of a bubble, and my Thrive has been a natural fit in my life and a conduit to the world. It's indispensable.> 20+ tablets coming out, including a newer, thinner Thrive.  Personally, I'm excited to see what Amazon's got up their sleeve with their upcoming new tab. I'm hoping for a slide-out keyboard, not that I'm in the market or could even afford to buy! I just like drooling over new tech.> Sales are tied between the Xoom and Thrive. The Xoomer's aren't interested in the ports; the Thriver's are.> the guys loved the Android platform vs. Apple's because they loved tinkering with the tablets and rooting them. Personally, rooting is nothing to be afraid of, and gives custom access and features to any Android tablet or phone. Just be aware it voids your warranty. I'll probably be rooting my Thrive once it's a little older.Looks like Amazon removed the link, so if you're interested, just look for Pie Grrrl's post in this review's discussion section: Posted on Sep 27, 2011 3:51:40 PM PDT.And lastly, and this time I mean it, a word about NetFlix -- I've cancelled my account, but some people have found a workaround until the official app is released. Point being, it will work, but just do a Google search, and I'm sure you'll find plenty of info. Having said that, Amazon VOD works perfectly, no tinkering required.BTW -- there's a post in this review's discussion thread, where on September 7, 2011 2:48:15 PM PDT -- where U. Shelat says explains how to get NetFlix working; As I no longer have NetFlix, I cannot verify if this works or not.Okay, I lied, I have to leave you with 1 last suggestion... get the Kindle app and read Jermaine Jackson's book about his brother Michael -- it's riveting. Yes, I have a review there, too. Love reading Kindle books on m Thrive. The book is called You Are Not Alone: Michael, Through a Brother's EyesThat's all for now, folks!Go forth all, and \"Androidify\" your Life!(Believe it or not, I didn't just coin that, it's actually an app):oDUPDATE 4 10-18-2011Had an interesting experience with an iPad today...Ran into someone who was trying to get photos transferred to their iPad -- they fumbled with hooking it up to their laptop, syncing to iTunes, then futzed another 30 minutes unable to make anything happen.  I just smiled.  Told the person how much I genuinely admire Mr. Jobs' genius, but wouldn't it be easier to just have onboard ports like on my Thrive -?- you'd be 30 seconds away from being done.  :oD>MORE GREAT APPS:>Webroot Security - FREE anti-virus, secure web browsing and rogue app scans.  Paid version includes ability to wipe a lost device clean on command.>Thumb Keyboard - Split your tablet's keyboard to the left and right corners of the screen -- makes typing and texting just as fast as a cell phone.>Circle Launcher - A nifty launcher widget that you place on your homescreen. Choose from a circle, a horizontal or a vertical line.>ADA Disabled Service Members - Free Americans With Disabilities Act info for Returning Service Members.Androidify all!:oDUPDATE 5 10-21-11Thrive just got an update adding Google Video support; basically movies on demand for a small fee. Between that, and Amazon VOD playing so well on Honeycomb and the Upcoming Kindle Fire, I'm beginning to think Netflix not working on Android Tabs is no accident. Either way, Netflix's time may well have come and gone, by their own doing as much as anything else.No word on Honeycomb 3.2, though at this point, I'm more interested in Ice Cream Sandwich! (Android 4.0) I saw a video and it looks yummy!  :o)UPDATE 6  10-24-11NETFLIX -- User ID \"Visa Citi\" just posted in the discussion thread for this review that NetFlix is now working. I downloaded the app, but was unable to log in, because I cancelled my NetFlix account several months back. I'm not interested in rejoining, but I checked another forum and confirmed that it is working.Android 3.2 -- is due shortly. And 3 weeks tardy in my humble opinion.Android 4.0 -- is the one we all want; no word on if or when.And it just goes without saying that I have to recommend more apps. Or as I like to call this portion of the review...KAIO'S ESSENTIAL ANDROID APPS:> AllRecipes.com Dinner Spinner -- Great recipe app.> Iris Alpha -- A prototype app that mimics Siri iPhone 4s.> Circle Launcher -- One of my new faves and recent Amazon Free App o' The Day -- Unclutter your desktop with this nifty launcher widget that you place on your homescreen. Choose from a circle, a horizontal or a vertical line. The widget contracts to a small icon that, when touched, expands to display all the icons you've enclosed within it. Can be completely customized to your preferences.Th-th-that's all folks!Enjoy and Androidify!;^DUPDATE 7 - 11/27/2011Skype - is officially working. I don't use it myself but several users have verified it.Android 3.2 - click the Service Station icon to update.  No meaningful cosmetic changes; most likely bug fixes.  No word on when 4.0 will be ready.A word about memory, by Jeffrey Peterman:\"If you look at the memory on the tablet, you'll find it split into 4:1. \"Normal\" internal memory, the same as the base memory on a phone.2. Internal SD memory, which is internal memory allocated for storage.3. External SD memory (an inserted microSD or SD, depending on the model.)4. USB memory.The system dynamically allocated memory between 1&2, without needing any user intervention, and this memory makes up the 8, 16, or 32 GB in the tablet. The other two \"spaces\" (inserted memory cards and USB memory) can ONLY be used for media storage - you can't run any program from an inserted card or a thumb drive, but you can open videos or documents that are on those removable spaces.\"Comment posted: Nov 27/11 3:30pmThanks JeffreyThe question about memory comes up a lot; how much to get?  Do I need 8, 16 or 32gb? To me, it's not a matter of the cost of a 32gb v.s. a 16gb + SDcard.  That comparison isn't equivalent, because having all the internal memory I need is far more valuable to me than an SDcard.  I'm not a fan of splitting critical and personal files that way.  I use my SDcard to float between several devices, but it always comes down to personal preference.Here's how it approximately breaks down:> an 8gb Thrive will have about 2.5gb available> a 16gb Thrive will have about 10gb available &> a 32gb Thrive will have about 25gb available.I've tried to write & update this review so it would answer an array of basic questions that come up often.  This is new technology to everyone, and it's the beginning of an exciting, new frontier.Androidify AllKaio:oDUPDATE 8 -- 3/17/2012Durability:  Well it's been 9 months with our Thrive, and still going strong.  The chrome finish near the camera is showing slight signs of wear.  And the lock on my SD card slot gave out just the other day.  It still reads SD cards, but I guess I'll have to tape them down, so the spring doesn't shoot it across the room.  Other than that, it's physically holding up quite well.Cool Volume Boost App: I found a cool app called Volume+ that boosts the audio up to 20X on the Thrive's speakers, and I even installed it on my new LG Marquee cell phone.  The app boosts the volume nicely on both devices, and can even boost bluetooth headsets and call volume as well.WiFi Tethering:  When I got my new cell phone I had to figure out all over again how to root it and configure the hotspot so I could tether my Thrive to it, but I got it working, and have a tutorial on how I did it posted on my blog.  Just check my Amazon profile for a link to my blog if you're interested, or check my post on March 7th in the Comments of this review for more details on tethering to a cell phone.Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich:  According to Toshiba's Twitter page, the Thrive will be getting this new version of Android by the end of Spring.  FINALLY!Android Green Back Cover:  I got the green back cover for my Thrive awhile back and it looks really cool.New Kid On The Block:  Toshiba Excite came out a couple of weeks back.  It's much thinner than the Thrive, so just decide if you need Thrive's ports and exchangeable battery.  If not, take a look at the Excite; it's currently the thinnest tablet on the market.More than likely this is my final update for the Thrive.  It's been fun seeing just how long this review can get, and how many comments we can all generate!!  Thanks to Everyone for all the fun.Keep Thriving & Androidify!;oDKaio... Still just visiting Earth!", "Date": "July 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "More than pleased", "Author": "Scott W. Hutton", "ReviewID": "R2PGLNUKE0BPJQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first tablet (had it about two weeks), but I work in IT and have configured upwards of 40 iPads for employees to use at my job. I liked the iPads, don't get me wrong, and while configuring them for our employees, I came to see the real benefit of having a tablet. I'm a big fan of the Android OS, so I decided I'd go with an Android tablet since it offers superior customization and streamlining.I went with the Toshiba Thrive and couldn't be happier. It's fast, responsive, and the Honeycomb OS is very, very slick. I can see a lot of potential in the OS and am looking forward to Ice Cream Sandwich (the next update that will integrate phone and tablet operating systems into one) later this year.PROS* Stable - I never experienced the sleep issue at all, but installed the fix yesterday anyway, since it offered some additional performance improvements. No issues out of the performance at all. Everything is fast and responsive. A joy to use.* Responsive - Honeycomb OS is very fast, clean, and customizable. Very intuitive to use (at least for me). Adding widgets, etc. is fun and easy to layout.* Video/graphics - Videos look great in all formats, but really snap in HD. All the graphics look great, and the text in the Kindle App looks amazing. Visually stunning. Everyone that has seen it has been impressed.* Customization - You can set up the five screens any way you want. Widgets are wonderful things! Also plugged it into my laptop and it loaded up without any problems, allowing me to copy some pictures, etc. quickly.* Multi-task management - The third button along the bottom left allows you to easily switch from application to application quickly. It's amazing how quickly you can get to something once you get used to using that button!* Size - to me, this is a pro, because you feel like you're holding something and it's very easy to hold on to. You don't get the sense it's going to slip out of your hands, like you sometimes do with the iPad2. It doesn't feel cheap or cheesy, but very solid.* Battery life - I've read some mixed reviews on this, but I get a good 7-8 hours of serious use out of it before it gets below 20%. Over nights, when sleeping, it uses 2%-4% battery life. And it does charge fast, they aren't kidding about that!CONS* The charger - Not a big deal, true, but it's a small laptop power supply, which I just find annoying to have to lug around. They should have a simple adapter you can use with the provided mini-USB to USB cable.* Sound - Not really a big issue (and I may be missing something), but even with the volume all the way up on the device, it still sounds a little low to me using headphones. Maybe just a preference here, but I thought I should mention it. It does sound much better without the headphones on, though, but can be a little clinky and suffer from reverb on heavier tracks of music.* Storage - not really a \"con\", but more of a heads-up. You won't have the full storage amount available to use. For example, if you buy the 8 GB version, you won't have 8 GB of storage to use. Honeycomb and other things (drivers, etc) take up part of that amount. Same with the 16 and 32 GB versions. Not a big deal, but I know some people are wondering why they only have 5 GB free when they bought the 8 GB version, for example.OVERALLA wonderful tablet, performs great, looks great, and has impressed a couple of co-workers enough that they are going to buy one. The full USB port was the big selling point for both. This tablet has been everything I'd hoped for and more. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a tablet. This is a great first step into the tablet pool by Toshiba, I must say. If you're wondering if this tablet will do what you want, I'm pretty sure it will :)I give the Thrive 5 Stars.NOTES* There were a couple of image/OS updates ready to be installed right out of the box using Toshiba's SERVICE STATION app. I recommend immediately installing those updates before you do anything else. As with any new laptop, PC, phone, or tab, you should update it first before jumping into other apps, etc.* I use ADVANCED TASK MANAGER to kill open apps that don't come with a native procedure for closing them. It integrates into Honeycomb very nicely, and all you need to do is tap the icon along the bottom right of the screen to open it from anywhere. Very slick and easy.* I recommend that after updating the Operating System and Tablet image through the SERVICE STATION app, you set the LOCK SCREEN PIN (founds in SETTINGS >> LOCATION & SECURITY >> LOCK SCREEN). Also fill out the owner information (it will appear on the lock screen with the keypad). You can never be too careful, and if you do lose it, at least when someone tries to activate it, you'll have it PIN protected with your contact info right there for them to see.Thanks for reading.

The Thrive is in my opinion the best tablet available. The things that set it apart from other tablets are: Removable battery, Full size HDMI port, Full size USB 2.0 port as well as a mini USB port. All on board with no dock or adapters necessary. You can take your SD card right out of your camera and plug it in to the Thrive ( Handles up to 128 GB SDXC, what?!!) . Toshiba was smart enough to include a file manager that makes it super easy to move data or media between the tablet and SD card or external hard drive, etc. Running Honeycomb 3.1 right out of the box as well. The wifi is the best I have seen, better than any device in my house and I have a lot. Tethers to my Android phone with no problem. The audio is the best I have heard on a tablet.Toshiba worked with SRS and it shows. (One note, the default volume levels are low. Go into settings and adjust right away) The screen is better than the Xoom but not quite as good as the Samsung (in my opinion) and it seems to do better with higher quality and higher resolution content. Looks phenomenal when viewing pictures from my Canon Digital with an L lens. Color accuracy is excellent,not just oversaturated like some other tablets. The screen response is great. Ran a multitouch test and it recognizes 4 separate touch points simultaneously. 2mp front camera and 5 MP back camera are both very good with good lighting. All in all this tablet offers more interoperabilty than anything on the market. It charges really fast, 90% in 90 minutes. Very, very happy with my decision to go with the Thrive. I had considered the Asus but with the horrific build quality issues and lightbleed I decided against it. I am so glad I waited because Toshiba got it right, right out of the box! This thing is solid! No creaking or flex. No loose bezel. Zero lightbleed. A tablet is the sum of all its parts and in the words of Charlie Sheen, #Winning!Update: 14 hrs today on the battery with fairly heavy surfing and some music and video. The battery gave me 6-7 hrs the first few charges. Wow, I didn't think it would improve this much!

First let me say this tablet is not perfect but I am am very pleased. It is like having a large smart phone. I love my smart phone! My husband was able to get most of his apps installed, but some of mine are not available for the tablet yet. I am able to use my cloud service and access several of my paid apps (spreadsheets, word docs, etc). The widgets & apps that are missing from the market are not an issue because I can access these items online (banking, personal finance site). I am optimistic that the android community will remedy this eventually. I am a techie and I love it.The interface is flawless & smooth, saved photos look really good (even when zoomed in), wireless connection excellent (no connection issues). So far my battery life has been 6hrs; but let me say I did not turn off wireless or Bluetooth. My screen brightness was on maximum. I played Need for Speed briefly, surfed the web alot (3-4 hours), downloaded apps and files, looked at several youtube videos. I think the speaker quality is good; picture quality OK; used tango and talked to hubby while he was at work.Remember this tablet is thicker than the Ipad 2, Samsung, etc; some may experience fatigue from holding it long periods of time. I typed this entire review on the keyboard. I like it and unless something really bad happens in the next 13 days I plan to keep it.07/19/11 UPDATED REVIEW -- Well I decide to update my review. (I was able to purchase the tablets early at Fry's on 07/05/11) I had the sleep issue and called Toshiba the first time on 07/07/11. While they were nice there was no resolution given. So I exchanged by tablet at Fry's on 07/08/11. Then my husband's tablet had the issue. I decided to be patient and started surfing the internet to see if anyone else was having the problem. Slowly, I saw more postings about this problem. My new tablet was starting to have a sleep issue too and rebooting by itself. I called Toshiba again on 07/13/11 and the rep told me that he had never heard of that problem before. By 07/15/11 it was on Toshiba's thrive forums and the internet extensively. I even looked to see if it was an Android issue that plagued other tablets. My 14 days to return the tablets for a refund were quickly approaching and I was hoping that Toshiba sent an update or that some of the fixes would work. While I realize any technology can have hiccups I felt that I needed to decide what to do. I did not want to be stuck with a problematic tablet.  I returned both tablets last weekend.I been checking the internet and I am glad to see that Toshiba finally realizes they need to fix this issue. I am surprise that it never showed up in testing. I hope it is a software issue and not a hardware issue because I am sure some of you have met your return time limits. I still think the tablet has some really nice features and I hope they work them out. I decided to buy the Xoom- no surprises.", "Date": "July 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Toshiba Thrive Review, a great product!", "Author": "Galal Hazzi \"Gello\"", "ReviewID": "R146IEY8ODNHNZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the Toshiba last weekend and I couldn't be happier, the tablet does everything I needed it to do. First, I would like to address some issues that some people and reviewers complained about.The sleep issue: some people complained that the tablet when going to sleep mode it does not turn on again unless the whole tablet is restarted. The issue does exist, although it happened to me once in a week, but Toshiba acknowledged the issue and is now working on a fix and will be out soon so lets just move past that.The size issue: well this will be a matter of preference, are the ports, expandibility and connectivity worth the trade off? To me the answer is yes. Im personally tired of Apple manipulating the consumer in order to make more money. Apple refuses to offer ports to make you buy adapters, they refuse to have a removable battery, even on phones (all phones have removable batteries except for Apple), because they want you to buy the battery from them and also have it installed by Apple and they charge you money for the installation. So,if you have an issue with the battery not only you pay for the battery, you also pay for the installation and don't try to do it yourself because you will void the warranty. Also, this tablet is not that much thicker or havier than most of the tablets out there, it might be heavy and thick on the spec. Sheet but it sure feels good in your hand especially with the rubberized back.Lack of flash in the back camera: well lets face it, even phone cameras with flash don't produce good images in low light conditions. Plus, did you really buy a tablet to take pictures? I don't think so. If you really wanna go this route you can use your phone camera or your point and shoot camera. Cameras on tablets are meant for video conferencing more than anything elseand the Thrive does that well.The battery: some people didn't like the fact that the battery gets depleted in one or two days of heavy use. Well, the charger provided with the tablet charges the battery in 1 hour! Try to beat that. Plus unless you are planning to use the tablet in the desert then you should be able to charge your tablet before the end of the two days.Now lets talk about the good stuff!Pros: Fast and responsive: apps, screens and the internet load fast, even keyboard responsiveness is great Ports and expandability: Full USB port, HDMI port and SD card slot. I love the SD card slot because unlike Apple iPad, it gives you options. You might need a 16 gb tablet today but what if you get a different job tomorrow or your needs change for any reason? With the iPad all what you can do is to put it on eBay and buy a bigger memory which is capped at 64gb, with the Thrive, just buy an SD card or save your work on a flash memory or even an external hard drive (full USB support remember?) Screen: I like the screen, I really didn't get the chance to put it next to an iPad but the screen resolution and color look great to me. Its very comfortable for reading, I do a lot of reading using the Kindle app., yet performs great for gaming and videos' which I do occasionally. Printer share app: this is the easiest and fastest way I have seen and experienced that make printing from a tablet a breathe. The app allows you to print from multiple sources and apps on the tablet via any wifi or Bluetooth printer available in range. I was able to print a PDF file sent to my email using the wireless printer in my room. The app detected the printer right away and printed the document in seconds. File manager: that's the only tablet that comes with a file manager that makes it easy to navigate through your files, documents, pictures etc.., exactly like you do on your PC and you can also create folders etc.. Camera quality: I think that the camera quality is great especially for a tablet or a mobile device in general. Removable battery: you can remove the battery and change it so you can have a new battery when the current battery is depleted or when you just feel like having an extra battery just in case. Back covers: I personally like the stock black back cover but I appreciate the fact that Toshiba thought about this and offered it, I think its a great way to customize your tablet by choosing from multiple colors, fast and easy.Cons: Android 3.1: definitely needs a little tweaking, there are minor issues across the board but overall I'll give it a 9 out of 10. Plus, all these issues im sure they will be ironed out in the next version or update of android. Apps: definitely the android market lacks tablet specific apps, the number of apps is much less than the ipad and the phone apps that look good on the tablet. Developers should accelerate their efforts and develop more apps and games for honeycomb. One of the main reasons people wrennot buying honeycomb tablets as much as the Ipad, is the number of apps available for download that are tablet specific. Lacks accessories: I really can't complain much here because the tablet just came out so hopefully in the future there will be more cases and stuff.Overall, I think the Thrive is a terrific tablet and it gets the job, any job done and done fast and I would definitely recommend this tablet to any one looking to buy a tablet and by the way this review was written on my Thrive using the on screen keyboard and it functions great. Typing was responsive although I was tyoing fast, exactly like if typing on my PC, there was no lag or any issues.", "Date": "July 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best Android tablet yet", "Author": "Bolster", "ReviewID": "R3O2GG6380L75D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In today's tablet market, there are a lot of choices.  If price is no object, you could easily be drawn to a 64 gb Ipad 2, which would give you a reliable, user-friendly package with plenty of onboard storage.  Ios 5 has also brought wireless syncing with Itunes and cloud storage.  With a great selection of apps, and strict quality control on the hardware and software, Apple is really tough to beat.So why buy an Android tablet? Maybe you hate Apple.  Maybe you love native Flash support in your browser.  Maybe you like more flexibility from your desktop layout, to storage and peripherals.  A lot of people go straight to the Samsung Galaxy Tab instead of the Ipad 2, seeing the Samsung as an Android Ipad, and why not - it is thin and light, has flashy aluminum on the back, and has a great display like the Ipad.For me, the Ipad was both expensive and restrictive, so I went looking for the Anti-Ipad.  I wanted expandible memory, the ability to plug in a flash drive, independence from Itunes, and I wanted it to be rugged.  It also needed a great display, needed to be comfortable to hold, and needed to be reliable.  That left me with the Toshiba Thrive and Acer Iconia A500 to choose between.I initally bought the Acer, as it had good reviews and the price was right under $400.  Three days with the A500 left me disappointed.  It would go into a coma instead of going to sleep.  The battery would drain, and it wasn't comfortable for me to hold, just like my wife's Ipad, because it was too thin.  For me, there is a point when something is so thin it becomes hard to hold, which is why screwdrivers all have handles of a certain size, and why coffee mug handles do too, as well as why the handles on pliers flare out instead of closing to the point where they would meet- it's about comfort.I returned the Acer (I still have an A100 that I use when I want something smaller) and ordered the 16 gb Thrive from Amazon.  I knew it was among the heaviest, and most likely the thickest tablet there is, but I had a feeling it was what I was looking for.  As a bonus, it had a full-sized HDMI out, takes up to 128 gb SDXC cards, has a removable battery (who else offers this?) and a rubberized back for easier grip.  Like just about every other tablet, phone, mp3 player, and toothbrush these days, it has 2 cameras.So with about 3 weeks of daily use, this has been everything I wanted. I ordered a 64gb sdxc card, dropped my favorite music and movies onto it, and have room for tons of storage left.  Around the house, wifi reception is great, and I get good reception anywhere, whereas I sometimes had poor reception with the A500. Like all Android tablets, there are seemingly endless apps in any imagineable category, and Netflix streaming now works without having to fiddle with various workarounds.SIZE/WEIGHTThe device is comfortable to hold in either portrait or landscape mode, and the border around the display lets my finger/thumbs rest without accidentally taping on something.  Does it weigh a lot? I don't think so.  The difference between my wife's Ipad and the Thrive are negligible, and the Thrive is more comfortable to hold, and the same is true vs. the HP Touchpad, which weighs about the same, but is as big (or small) as an Ipad 1.  Its weight is hidden in how comfortable it is to hold.  As for size, a tablet just needs to fit in a suitcase, small bag, or backpack, which the Thrive does with ease.  It is thick, but never seems too big, or behind the tech curve.  Toshiba isn't hiding vacuum tubes inside, they made it bigger because it is easier to work with.  If it was a cell phone, this would have been a mistake, but full-sized tablets don't fit in your pocket, no matter what brand.ON THE GOThis is where battery life, storage capacity, and connectivity either help or hurt you.  Go somewhere without wifi, and there's no cloud access, no downloading, no streaming.  Having your music and movies onboard makes this a non-issue.  I can easily get 7 hours out of the battery if I turn off the wifi and just watch movies. An extra battery doubles that.  If I need to plug in, I am not teathered to a 3-foot cord, like many tablets have. I can be several feet away from an outlet and not have to hold it awkwardly because the cord is too short.  Charging seems to be reasonably fast, which is another plus.THE SCREENThis is what the user looks at all the time. The screen looks great.  Colors are good, brightness is enough to use outside, and the screen responds well, too.SOUNDThe speakers are not huge, and won't blow you away.  HP's touchpad has better speakers, maybe it's just that the slots are bigger and let more sound out.  They are adequate.PORTSThe USB port works as a host.  I have used it to charge my Ipod. It sometimes wants a reboot before it will recognize some flash drives, but it has not had any serious problems, and is a real plus.  HDMI out works immediately, and gives you the ability to stream Netflix to a hotel TV in a snap. Full sized SD card is very flexible, but I sometimes have trouble with micro SD cards reading.  It could be the adapter itself, but i can plug the micro SD into a USB card reader and there is no trouble reading that way.NEGATIVES1) No charging through USB. It would be nice, but even the Ipad requires a wall charger.  The Thrive's charger is just like a netbook charger with a small brick.  This has not been a problem, but it would be nice if it was smaller.2) Android 3.1 isn't always stable. Probably not Toshiba's fault, but apps crash sometimes, which is a rarity with Ios stuff.  I hope 4.0 will be better.3) The power button is hard to find sometimes.  You won't accidentally hit it, unless you're going for the volume rocker right next to it.  I also like the home button to be a real, bonafide button, rather than the one on the screen.  Only Apple and HP have a real button on their hardware for this.  I like a real button because hitting it is always intentional, and an accidental sweep of it doesn't send you home.4) No flash for the rear camera.  I think it's absurd to hold up a tablet and start taking photos, as I can't believe anyone would use a tablet primarily for this, but since they have a camera, why not put a flash in with it, like others have?  I do have a device that is made for this, and will always do a better job, though. It's called a camera.  Also, Acer did it right by offsetting the cameras so landscape mode doesn't cause you to inadvertently cover the camera.CONCLUSIONMy advice to people who don't want an Ipad for whatever reason is to seriously consider the Thrive. Everything else has compromises and limitations, and nothing else is as rugged.  You will need to buy a protector to prevent the plastic or aluminum from being scratched on everything else.  Asus has the transformer, which I have not tried, but I didn't want to spend an extra $150 for a keyboard and USB (it's really a matter of what each person values).  The Thrive is unique, and in a good way.", "Date": "October 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "The most flexible of them all", "Author": "gus octel \"gus\"", "ReviewID": "R1T9L4LWO8EKB4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I returned the Iconia when I found out the Thrive was going to have Honey Comb 3.1 a SD card, a REAL HDMI port not a mini, a removable battery and an electrical cable longer than 20 inches (a total joke you will find on the Iconia.)They both offer endless memory expansion with a USB thumb drive but the Thrive lets me easily plug in and out a dozen SD cards quickly.  The Iconia has a mini SD and it is painful.  You will not switch out one card for another.The Ipad and its closed architecture are NOT for people who know how to use computers.Let me be brief so you can read the rest of the review on these stellar products.  On more than one occasion the contents of the IPad have disappeared due to ITunes Sync issues.  Nothing and I mean nothing beats the drag and drop of files onto the Android tablet.  When you are done delete them as opposed to doubling your storage needs, a copy on the computer and one on the Ipad is a pain.All three IPads that I tested ALL had wireless G/N connectivity issues; regardless of the router brand they constantly lose the connection.The Iconia and Thrive kick Apple to the curb on that technical glitch.  Apples solution is to force you to use N only on the router but this does not solve the connection problem.  Add the closed design of ITunes to manage everything with zero built in ports and just forget it.Enter Thrive over the Galaxy and over the Iconia.  What you get here is Honeycomb 3.1,  the email client alone is a step up.  On the Iconia with 3.0 if you wanted to create email in anything other than Gmail you had to enter all the inbound/outbound crap.  Thrive with 3.1 automatically figures that out for the most popular email systems.Add the USB port and the full SD card and you have instant access to an UNLIMITED library of material when you are on the road.  Take your SD chip out of your camera and you are instantly looking at your photos.  Carry a few SD cards with your music tastes, specific presentations per industry or client type or a bunch of ripped movies for a 10 hour flight and you get the idea.  Why be limited by fixed storage.Honest case in point, my family came off a plane today, the car was dead in the airport lot. While waiting for AAA we took the SD card out of the vacation camera that just landed, popped it into the Thrive and watched an hour of photos talking about the trip with those who had not been there while we waited for AAA.  Productive and keeps the kids busy.Next test will be compact flash adapter that will shortly get plugged into the USB slot.Go to any hotel/presentation room with your $10 HDMI cable or walk into any story if you forgot it and instantly connect with a FULL size standard cable.  The Iconia uses a mini HDMI, just one more pain in the you know what to go and find if you lose the original.  Never mind lost the sale if you cannot connect to a panel.  Just about everyone has a standard HDMI cable in presentation rooms today.The pluses on the Thrive are endless but the weight is killer, it's heavy and thick.  Add the Toshiba versatile rotating carry case and it's huge but it is a price I am more than willing to pay for all the connectivity ports.  This is a Swiss army knife of Tablets.The Iconia I must tell you with 3.0 was faster on connecting to internet pages. And I mean lightning fast!!! I have to blame 3.1 like any OS update since the processor is the same on both.  I don't know if the wireless adapter card on the Iconia is a better or faster unit.  Here the Iconia beat the Thrive but it might lose this edge when the Iconia updates to 3.1.If you are on the road the endless power with removable batteries is great, it just keeps on ticking.Another issue regarding power: the Iconia provides you a useless 20 inch electrical cable.  The Thrive has the equivalent of a laptop small power adapter and 6 or more feet of cable.  FORGET the idea that you will use a universal mini or micro USB plug to power either the Iconia or the Thrive; NOT GOING TO happen, just buy a universal adapter that works on your laptop and then switch connector for the tablet.So far, the Thrive wins hands down.Other Cons on the Thrive so you know it's not perfect.  The power button is too recessed on my unit.

I picked one up and all I can say is that I love it! Aside from a few Honeycomb 3.1 quirks, and the fact the Thrive is a little thicker than its competition, it feels solid in my hands and responds smoothly and quickly to my touch.  One of the things that has me really happy is the full size SD card and the full size USB port!  For twenty dollars I doubled my memory with a 16GB SD card, lets see the Samsung Tab or IPad do that.  I've been using it non-stop for five days and so far no crashes or freezing up.  The battery life is ok, however the battery charges faster then my cell phone.  I can pretty my charge the tablet in an hour, not to shabby.

After working with it for a few weeks, I'm finding the Toshiba is a solid product and credible alternative to other Android tablets and iPad.In terms of construction quality, the Toshiba is beefy and solid feeling. Most surfaces are covered in a rubbery non-slip material, and although it's slightly heavier and thicker than most competitors, it still feels right in your hands. The screen is reasonably high quality...to me, not quite as readable as Apple's, but certainly more than adequate. Touch screen performance is very good, and unlike some other models, I find it easy to interact with it, even for objects right near the edge of the screen. I'm generally more of a physical keyboard fan, but Toshiba's touchscreen seemed more appealing than most.The Android implementation is generally very good, and it seems more stable than previous versions. Still, I've had a few application crashes on the Toshiba, but it's difficult to know whether it's Android, the app developer or the Toshiba. Overall, I'd have no trouble recommending it for day-to-day use, even for demanding users. One particular issue I've been having is connecting to my corporate secure network. It's locked with a WPA2 key, and while I have other Android devices working fine, the Toshiba seems to struggle. It's worked fine on other networks I've tried - including others protected with WPA2 - but for some reason, the network I use most often seems to be difficult.Where the Toshiba really shines is expansion capabilities. It supports Bluetooth 3.0, giving you access to keyboards, mice, headsets and so on. It has standard USB ports, meaning you can easily attach things like external disk drives. It has an SD card slot, making on-board storage almost limitless, since you can easily carry as many SD cards as you like. It even has HDMI and a fairly strong docking station, so when you're in the office, you can use your desktop monitor and keyboard, making the Toshiba a PC replacement for less demanding tasks. Indeed, one of the first apps I installed is virtual desktop client software, letting me have my full Windows desktop, right on the Toshiba. In large companies with virtual desktop initiatives, these devices make very cool endpoint devices.The cameras are about average for this type of product. If you have the bandwidth, video conferences are possible, and stills are good enough so that the Toshiba makes a great barcode scanner. I was able to get a usable scan of a 2x2 inch QR code from about two feet - better than most. Still, I'm not giving up my DSLR yet.The only reservation I might have is about whether you want cellular (3G/4G) network integration. Devices like the Toshiba Thrive generally mean you'll need to be carrying a cell phone, and if you want to network your tablet in a place where 802.11 WiFi networks aren't available, it can get complex. Certainly, many modern smartphones can act as a WiFi hotspot, or you can pair via Bluetooth or cables, so there are ways to have mobile access. But, if you're looking for that all-in-one, use it anywhere experience, you might prefer integrated 3G/4G capabilities.Cellular networking feels like the only obvious omission to me, so if you're the type who seems to always be in range of an 802.11 signal, then I definitely recommend you check out the Toshiba Thrive.", "Date": "July 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Thrive great for world travel-Updated Dec 2012", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RIOPM149EKAFJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "See my second update at the end: Dec 2012I bought my 16Gb Toshiba Trive 6 weeks ago for two types of travel: long airplane flights to and travel in Africa, and electronic charts and plates for flying our airplane. I couldn't be happier with my purchase. And I've found some benefits beyond my original reasons for purchase.As for charts and plates in our airplane the iPad is the standard for pilots. But the iPad is a closed system.  We have Windows PCs and a Windows 7 Phone other than my wife's Android phone.  So adding an Apple product just wasn't going to work. I found Android apps that will do all I need in the airplane.  I don't need the Thrive for locating the plane on approach plates as can be done with the iPad.  I have two aviation GPSs in the plane.  They already do a great job.  I just want to replace the 20 pounds of charts and plates I currently haul around in the plane.  The Thrive can do that just fine. Though the Trive is heavier than the iPad for mounting on the yoke.Foreign travel is where the Thrive really shines. In both Mali and Uganda reliable Wifi is hard to come by.  So I had to preload most of what I was going to use before leaving the land of prevalent Wifi. Here's how I prepared for my latest trip:1) I loaded my 32Gb SD card with 32 movies before I departed for Africa.  The Thrive requires conversion of the movies from AVI to MP4 for the stock player.  So I had to get some software to do the conversion. That software is very slow. But it works.  Update 12/14/11 - QQPlayer plays AVI movies no problem.2) I loaded a 16Gb SD card with all of my music.3) I loaded copies of all my critical files in the Thrive internal memory.4) I downloaded a number of ePub books for FBReader and a couple Amazon books for the Kindle app.5) I purchased the Larousse English-French dictionary and Petite Larousse.  All data is stored locally so is usable without a Wifi connection.6) I got all of the newspaper readers I regularly use, particularly the New York Times reader, for use whenever I have wifi access. Otherwise I use my Windows 7 Phone which uses my cell connection for newspapers, Facebook and email.7) I purchased the full version of Office Suite for creating and editing Word docs and Excel spreadsheets.8) I loaded some games and utilities that I might need.9) Then in addition to the standard Toshiba case I purchased a case for the Thrive that has an integrated USB keyboard. And I got a bluetooth mouse ($17 at Fry's).  The keyboard works great!10) I have British and French plug converters for the battery charger. And I was set to go.Flights to either West or East Africa take 24 hours from the US West Coast with one or two layovers.  On the longest leg I worked on an MS Word document using Office Suite for a couple hours.  Then after watching two full length movies using QQPlayer I swapped SD cards and switched to reading books in FBReader while listening to my music in RealPlayer with good noise cancelling headphones.  It was the most pleasant of the many flights I've made to Africa. After 9 hours of continuous use of the Thrive on the longest flight I still had 15% battery and it was playing music with almost no further drop in battery availability.  The Thrive battery recharged in a little over an hour in the Amsterdam airport.Now here in Africa I use the Thrive almost every day both for reading a book while I'm waiting for a meal to be prepared or watching a movie in the evening if I haven't fired up my big 17\" Toshiba Satellite laptop. I can use the Thrive for hours even when the power's out because of the long battery life. African power is always intermittent. So battery life is quite important.The Thrive is perfect for downloading pictures from my Canon digital camera for showing friends pictures I've brought with me or have recently taken.  The folks here love seeing pictures on the tablet.  It's so much nicer than peering at pictures on the tiny camera screen.  And while viewing the photos of themselves zooming in using the touch screen is a real hit. Then I can transfer the recent photos onto a friend's flash drive so they have a copy of the pictures to keep. I use the laptop for more permanent storage of photos.  But the Thrive is so portable, quick to boot up, and easy for friends to use the touch screen I use it almost exclusively when visiting.On long drives on African roads I break out my Thrive and put it in the keyboard case.  I can hold the tablet on my lap and use the keyboard for writing reports.  I don't have to worry about bouncing around a spinning hard drive like I would if I tried using my big laptop in a vehicle. The laptop stays in it's case when on the road.There is a problem using the Thrive in a vehicle on the road.  When it's sunny out, which is quite often the case here in Africa, I have to manipulate the tablet into partial shade to be able to see the screen. This is true whether I'm composing documents or reading books. In direct sunlight the screen is difficult to see. I have a daytime setting in FBReader that increases the screen brightness that helps some.  But the Thrive is not a Kindle reader.  That said, the Thrive is great for reading a book in bed with the lights out.  A friend has to use a portable light to illuminate her Kindle. The Thrive screen is quite bright for reading in the dark with no external illumination.Both the pre-installed File Manager and ES File Explorer do a good job of manipulating  files on the Thrive.  I regularly copy backup versions of documents I create on the tablet onto a flash drive. Or I can plug the tablet into my laptop to place a backup copy on the laptop drive. It's this file manipulation flexibility that really sold me on the Thrive. I have not been disappointed.Now that I use a touch screen on both my cell phone and the Thrive tablet I find myself trying to touch my laptop screen rather than use the mouse. I have the mouse for the tablet.  But I only use it when I'm doing concentrated composing or editing in  Office Suite. Otherwise the touch screen works great.Being a touch typist I could tell immediately I need the external keyboard for document work on the Thrive. Placing your fingers over the home row on the tablet screen keyboard just causes a lot of extraneous letter touches since it's static electricity that activates the screen, not finger pressure. To type on the screen keyboard it's better to be a hunt-and-peck typist since you are only touching one screen letter at a time.Some day when Toshiba and Google enable Android tablets to use a cell modem I'll be able to leave my big heavy laptop at home and just use the Toshiba tablet while traveling. Wifi is not readily available outside the developed countries. Right now if I need something from the Internet I have to retrieve it on my laptop then transfer it to the Thrive unless I'm in a capital city and can find Wifi at a hotel or office.Here in Africa the Thrive and my Windows 7 phone with a local SIM card in it get most of the use. I only have to crank up my laptop for serious Internet surfing and using Photoshop for organizing my photos and posting them on Facebook.  If I have Wifi access I can post on Facebook from my Thrive tablet.  But that's not very often.The Toshiba Thrive has proven to be a real addition to the tools I use while traveling. It far exceeds my original expectations. My wife joins me in Uganda in a couple of weeks.  We'll see what additional uses she'll find for the tablet since her Android phone isn't GSM and won't work outside the US. We only have one headset to plug into the Thrive for audio in movies and music. We'll see how sharing works.UPDATE 12/14/2011 - back home - I've had my Thrive for 4 monthsAfter my wife joined me in Uganda we left the big laptop at the NGO office in Kampala and just used the Thrive tablet for the next 3 weeks. It worked great as a laptop substitute while traveling.Wifi: We rarely had Wifi access in Uganda. So for the regular emails we send home to family and friends I composed them on the Thrive in Office Suite Pro. (Stick with DOC format - the DOCX format still has a few issues.) I transferred the Word format document to a flash drive. Then it was quick and cheap to go to an Internet cafe and send the email with the document from the flash drive as an attachment. For my next trip I now have a Motorola Droid 3 which I'll use as a wireless hotspot for the Thrive using the local cellular service. I've tested it at home and it works great.File Management: Our son is a Linux jockey. So he showed me how to use the samba feature in ES File Explorer. Now that we're home again I have the Thrive connected to our home wireless network. In ES File Explorer select LAN. Then just press the search button near the top. It finds all of the Windows computers on our home network. Every shared drive or folder on the networked PCs is now available on the Thrive. So you don't have to use a flash drive as an intermediary for transferring files to the Thrive internal storage or SD card. Just use ES File Explorer and do a much faster file transfer back and forth between the Thrive and the folders in any networked PC using Wifi.Daily Usage: I find I'm using the Thrive everyday for reading email and for reading my NY Times subscription and many world newspapers using Pulse and News360. The Gmail and Email readers are much easier to use on the Thrive than on my Motorola Droid 3 or even the PC versions. The Thrive versions give you a split screen view. Quick scanning and weeding out emails is easy.Updates: I have all the latest updates on my Thrive which is version 3.2.  All of the earlier reported problems such as unexpected shutdowns are gone.Adobe has an updated version of basic Photoshop for Honeycomb now. It's PS Touch. It replaces the earlier Photoshop Express which was pretty useless. PS Touch now gives you tools to edit a single photo. You still can't make slideshows or albums such as you can with PS Elements on the PC. But I was able to crop and increase brightness and contrast to greatly improve a photo of a young Batwa (pygmy) girl next to her hut.I travel to Angola next month. My longest flight is 17 hours. I'll be pushing my Thrive to the limit. I'm set up with entertainment for the flights.  The Thrive charges in 1 hr. So I can prepare it for subsequent flights during layovers. I have my plug adapters for the charger.Movies: I can rent movies from the Google Android Market shortly before I depart. I can \"pin\" them to the device which downloads the movie to the tablet rather than streaming it. I'll put them on my SD card. I'll have 30 days in which to start viewing the movie.Music: I've got my entire collection synched in WMA format to the SD card. WMA is compact with still decent quality. So I'll have plenty of good music to listen to with my noise cancelling headphones.Books: While listening to my tunes I'll read books I check out from our county library in ePub format. I'll check them out just before departure so I have the full 21 days to read them.  I also have some classics loaded for later. I'm happy to not have to lug around 10 pounds of books to have sufficient reading material for weekslong trips.I'm continuing to find new uses and features for the Thrive. It serves me well both at home and for extensive travel.Update #1 3/18/2012I continue to use the Thrive on a regular basis. We recently took our grandsons to Kenya and Tanzania to go on safari in the Masai Mara and Serengeti. The grandsons are 8 and 12. They used the Thrive to play Angry Birds and a few other games to while away the hours on long travel stretches. It takes at least 24 hours to travel to East Africa from the Pacific NW. The Thrive really helped when the younger boy found out his Nintendo DS charger wouldn't work outside the US because the charger is 120 volt only and the rest of the world uses 240 volt power. The Thrive charger is of course usable on either voltage. So the Thrive got a workout.After my wife and the grandsons went home I continued on to Uganda. The grandsons took the Thrive with them for the plane ride home. I used my new smaller Acer Aspire 13.6 inch laptop and my cell phones. I found the laptop - international cell phone combination works great. The Thrive and a cell phone work equally well in most cases. So the Thrive in countries where a smartphone can be used for Web access can be an option to carrying a laptop.Update #2 12/11/2012The Thrive now sits in a drawer most of the time. In comparison to newer 7 inch tablets the Thrive is a slow dog. I got a bargain on a Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus. The smaller size is much easier to handle. And it's fast. With 16Gb plus a 32Gb microSD card there's tons of storage in the Galaxy. I had thought the 7 inch size would be too small for reading charts and approach plates in our airplane. But I just flew with the 7 inch tablet and it worked well. It's much lighter and quicker to respond than the Thrive. The GPS does seem to be a bit more accurate in the Thrive. But not by much.The other problem with the Thrive in comparison to newer tablets is slow wireless. The Thrive must just be 802.1g, not 802.1n. The slow wireless speed of the Thrive is maddening at times. Wireless reception is also much weaker in the Thrive than in newer tablets and phones. At this time the Thrive is out of date. There are better choices available.", "Date": "October 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "What I Think of the Two Toshiba THRiVES Pruchased with 32gb SD Cards", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"NoClue-Really!\"", "ReviewID": "R1PT48UIAD1WAP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "20120626 UPDATE (THIS IS IMPORTANT) - The MOG app uses \"*read sensitive log data\" permission -- The THRiVE is still the best tablet on the market this is just one of the \"bad\" things app writer's (both Apple and Android) do to unsuspecting users.

Several weeks later, this moment is only a memory!20120420 UPDATE - There are notes scattered below of changes or new information.  Here is one that may be useful.  To make listening more comfortable, I initially added the Cyber Acoustics AC-204 Headset&Mic; w/PC Y-Adapter (a necessity for Google Voice since the 903+, mentioned next, only operates as a headset on the THRiVE); however, I have migrated to the Plantronics BackBeat 903+ Headset for Music/Video and my cell phone - both of these are available \"Prime\" on Amazon.com.WE BOUGHT TWO AND THIS IS WHAT WE THINK ABOUT THEM!I looked for a tablet that met my needs.  The iPad is way to proprietary for me and I do not use/like the iTunes closed environment.  I also looked at the Xoom and the now defunct HP.  I read about many others.  Here is why I chose the Toshiba THRiVE tablet over any of the other tablets available and have been using it for several months now.1.  User replaceable/changeable battery that gives some 11 hours of usage (my longest continuous was 16 hours - of course, doing work that involved no movies, no video, and for grins and giggles I uninstalled the apps that unnecessarily consume battery and those apps that launch for no good reason at boot time and just run even when there is no need).2.  The spare battery allows me some 22 hours of time.  I have run four (4) full length movies on one charge and there is plenty of battery charge remaining to do more stuff.  If you travel long distances whether by airline, train, car, boat, etc., you will appreciate the time the THRiVE gives you with its replaceable battery.  The \"grand\" iPad dies after a few short hours unless one has an extension cord or a power source to keep it running which means you must be okay with being tethered to an automobile's battery or a power outlet (if available).3.  Two fully functional USB ports.  One for the stuff in the toy collection that needs a large USB connector; and, one for the other stuff in the collection that needs a small USB connector.4.  Though not suggested or recommended, it is possible for the THRiVE to be connected to a desktop and act as a drive.  You will need to do your own research to learn more!5.  The THRiVE has a standard SD card slot.  A few of the other tablets have a microSD card slot.  The THRiVE offers 128gb SDXC (yes, that is an 'X') card usage capability.  128gb is not really what I need at the moment but I am glad I can upsize to 128gb should I need it in the future.  Two 32gb class 10 SDHC (yes, that is an 'H') cards are pre-loaded with video and music and apps when I am on flights lasting as long as 13 hours.  Unless first class is affordable, there are usually no outlets in the back-of-the-plane.  The EuroRail offers 220 outlets that are suitable for the THRiVE without buying additional power modules (an adapter for the power plug is required to fit the power sockets).  The SD cards give me the capability of having a tremendous amount of material to keep me occupied whether video, music, work, or whatever.6.  The 10 inch screen is very readable and the refresh rate is very good.  The color appears to be good even though I have not done anything to color correct it.  It fortunately does NOT seem to have that garish color saturation for the fake \"vivid\" look.7.  The THRiVE does not have to be \"rooted\" or \"jailbroken\" like some devices (iPad is the most notible) to provide some great features and wonderful capabilities that are highly desirable.8.  The Kindle app is available from the android market (20120420-now called Google Play) as are other great apps to meet probably most, if not all, of your needs.  It is important to get the google account!  Remember, like all of the tablets, it is a \"cloud\" device and connection to the \"cloud\" is an absolute MUST!  Next, so you will never be disappointed with an app, it will be a very good use of your time to login, using your THRiVE account at Google.com, to the android market from a desktop and then find the apps that seem like something suitable for you.  The android market will use your THRiVE login and the developer information to inform you if the app will work with Honeycomb 3.1 (your THRiVE's operating system) and the Toshiba tablet.  Please do this.  You will read a lot of comments from folks about apps they tried to use, on their tablet/smartphone, but did not check to learn if the app would work on their device.9.  The THRiVE has been traveling with me for some time.  It always has worked as it should.  It works even better when the developer creates a proper app that knows when the \"cloud\" is present and prepares itself to know how to work when the \"cloud\" is temporarily unavailable!10.  There are many more features and capabilities provided by the Toshiba THRiVE that set it apart from the other tablets that caused me to buy two (2) of them.  I am trying to get time to play with all of the THRiVE's features and capabilities.11.  The THRiVE works flawlessly with my Pogoplugs so that I can stream/download video via Wi-Fi at the brick-and-mortor places I have tried this.  Of course, I can put the THRiVE to work listening to my music on my Pogoplugs, vi Wi-Fi, while I do other things on the THRiVE.12.  If you are lucky enough to have, and can afford, a Mi-Fi or a Car-Fi the THRiVE's capabilities and features work flawlessly keeping you at work and entertained.13.  20111011 UPDATE ... How could I forget!  The next best thing to a user-replacable battery is a battery recharge that takes a discharged battery and fully recharges it about one (1) hour.  The importance of this is that those two or more hours of \"sit\" time, in an airport, waiting for the next leg of the flight allows me to totally recharge both my batteries and use the THRiVE at the same time.14.  20111013 UPDATE ... When reviewing an apps' permission, do make sure the \"Show All\" is clicked so that you can view the permissions that are not popular for a developer to use yet the permissions are used because they can be used and the use is not necessarily for the benefit of the THRiVE user.Ya just have to admit that Toshiba and its THRiVE was the first tablet that was done correctly from the get-go!Short comings (of wireless, developers, and ... that limit the THRiVE)1.  The THRiVE is a cloud device like the Xoom, the iPad, the xxx, etc. and is limited in what it can do once it is away from the internet.  This limitation is mostly the fault of the developer of the app that forgets that Wi-Fi is not every where as one might think or is told.  There are really places in these United States that are devoid of McDonalds, BurgerKings, and the like.  When this happens, the interaction with the internet goes dark, very DARK!  3g/4g is no better.  Unlike the advertisements where the wireless vendors would like you to believe that 3g/4g is pervasive, it is NOT if you leave the city/metropolitian areas.2.  The so called \"unlimited\" 3g/4g data packages are \"capped\" and very expensive.  If you take a moment and read the fine print that I have read in the data service contracts it really limits what can be done with their 2, 5, 10 gig data plans (fine print from one wireless privider indicated if you use to much of your \"unlimited\" plan they can disconnect your service -- how does one use to much of \"unlimited?\").  I think T-Mobile is the exception at the moment but this may not be so for long with the eminent purchase by another wireless provider (?).  A movie is about 4gb to download/stream unless you buy/obtain the movie and then dumb it down (lower the resolution/size) with software available at some retail outlets/online.  The wireless vendors also control the speed available to the device at the tower.  I can tether my old Motorola Razr (vintage 2007 - D and EV capable) to my computer and use a real \"unlimited\" data plan that is grandfathered at $30/mth that has gone, when tower allowed, to 1,000Kbps for extended periods when in the right place.3.  The THRiVE cannot access the Whisper Net like the 3g versions of the Kindle.  Even the \"crappy\" experimental browser on the Kindle is better than a cell phone, Wi-Fi, laptop, iPad, Nook, etc. when there is no other access.  \"I know!\"  I was in the middle of no where on the EuroRail in Europe just East of the French border and I needed information.  Nothing, from unlocked SIMM'd cell, to ... woked except the Kindle, it's \"crappy\" experimental browser, and Whisper Net.  The \"silk\" browser of the \"Fire\" kindle is supposed to be much, much, better?4.  The THRiVE might be a little heavy for some of the critics.  If you are like me and travel with a backpack it is no big deal.  The provided default non-skid back has been a lifesaver - granted, it is not pretty but I do not need pretty!5.  Since the rage is the \"black\" appearing screen we are stuck with it.  Like laptops, and other displays, the \"black\" appearing screen is for indoor office/home use.  The designers forgot about us folks that are of the out-of-doors sorts.  It has a mechanism that really tries to make the screen bright enough to see in the sunlight that does only a minimal amount of good.  Fortunately, a shadow can often be made that allows the eyes to adjust and the screen can be seen a whole lot better than a smartphone.6.  A netbook, a laptop, and a desktop offer some privacy that is not in the scope of how things seem to work in the tablet/smartPhone cloud environment.  App Permissions MUST be carefully checked (check the apps Permissions from a desktop/laptop connected to the Android market).  Some apps watch and disseminate everything that is done and will continue to do so 24x7x365.  As an example, think of it this way.  There are certain apps where the coordinates of every bathroom stop made every day can be sent out into the internet along with any other information the developer chose to include while the device is carried and power to the device is enabled.  The only way to stop this behavior permanently is to uninstall the app.  The way to tolerate and coexist with this behavior is to review the intent of the app and plan what you do accordingly (20111027 - this context must be applied to the list of apps below for your use).  When the tablet is not being used, totally power down (this would be the same as removing the battery if the provided on-off switch were not available).  Another way is to uninstal the app when it is not useful (this is not painful and is for the most part a rather quick process unlike what most of us have experienced in the Microsoft world).  With more research in the Android market, there is probably another app that will more than likely do the same thing and be less intrusive and invasive.  I mostly go for the \"free\" apps and NEVER, never, the ones that have advertisements!7.  It is important to have something watch for malicious apps.  \"Yes!\"  there are evil people masterminding \"tricks\" to steal anything and everything (processing time, identity, passwords, etc.).  Kaspersky, and Norton are probably the better tools designed for the Android tablet at the present time.  There are some free tools that have not-so-good reputations in the technical trade publications.8.  Android tablets are also thought of as Smart Phones seemingly because when Android was first marketed by Google, there were only smartphones and there were no Android tablets.  So, this might be a little confusing at first when the app only makes reference to smartphones.20111027 - UPDATE ... I am answering this question, \"What do I use on the THRiVE?\"  This is no endorsement of any of the Android apps, the developer(s), or any personal involvement (financial, ownership, etc.).  I like these apps because they do what I want-and-need until I find something better.  Keep in mind that some are particularly invasive to privacy, some use processor cycles that could be better used by another app, and some consume battery whether they are being used or not. The apps (in no particular order) ...20120420 - UPDATE ... Try \"Airplane Mode\" with the apps on the THRiVE.  Airplane mode often makes an app that tracks the device user workable so it becomes a way to manage \"some\" invasive apps that might otherwise be useful.  Just remember to either uninstall/\"Force Stop\" the app and clear cache when finished using it.  It if \"pops up\" on reboot it might be an app that has to be uninstalled when not in use.ANDROID APPS (I use - downloaded ONLY)A.  Pogoplug - It provides access at the tablet to my Pogoplug that I use to store my video, music, pictures, and other stuff that I want to access while I am out and about (encrypted with PKWare AES 256).  I do not really need it since I could go to <...> and do most of the same things if not more.  (20120420-PKWare has posted that it will make available a reader for the android market in the 2nd quarter 2012.  This is great news when one has to carry protected documents that now can be accessed on the THRiVE).B.  TripAdvisor - The online version was not all that interesting to me.  There apps do it right!  If you want to see what I mean, get one of them say, \"Hawaii Travel Guide or Los Angeles City Guide!\"  When one is traveling it is not always possible to be connected to the internet (like flying - and a legal requirement is to have the THRiVE in \"Airplane mode\" over the Pacific on an aircraft that is not Wi-Fi equipped or I do not want to pay the fee to use onboard Wi-Fi ... ).  TripAdvisor series of apps work where-you-are and when-you-need-them even if there is not internet connection (of course, an internet connection is necessary for updates to the apps and the data that can be done whenever).  These folks are responsive to a user's thoughts, comments and feedback.20120420-For some odd reason, the folks at TripAdvisor changed their strategy.  An internet connection is now a necessity to use their apps - I would rate this app \"BAD\" if it were not for their good information.  Now, I have to put myself on pause until I am within range of internet access ... .C.  Kaspersky - This is the only paid app on my THRiVEs.  It was available before Norton.  I wanted protection.  These folks are responsive to a user's thoughts, comments and feedback.D.  Adobe Reader - Just have to have my PDF's!  Enough written.20120420-Check the settings for a lot more tools that will be very useful.E.  Amazon Kindle -  Need I say more?F.  Google Docs, Google Earth, Google Maps, Google Translate, Google Voice, and Google Books - Each provides a glimps into the developer's Android creation.  Keep in mind that the Google developer's belief appears to be that the user would always have \"open\" internet connection no matter where they were or where they went.  \"Ain't happening yet!\"  However, the tools are worthwhile.G.  Adobe Flash Player - Yep, it works and does what it should.H.  Androidify -  Okay, so it is cute.  I liked it and fits my creative side when I am bored.I.  Barcode Scanner - The one by ZXing Team I like the best.  These folks are responsive to a user's thoughts, comments and feedback.J.  Centrury 21 Real Estate Mobile - The developer did a good job for the most part.  These folks are responsive to a user's thoughts, comments and feedback.K.  Cracker Barrel - It is food that meets my picky needs.L.  ERA Mobile Real Estate - (see J.)M.  Finance -  A Google tool.  Weird that it only completely works on one THRiVE.  I have hopes they will tell me where to find the corrupt data and how to delete.20120420-There has yet to be a response on this from Google.N.  FlightAware Flight Tracker - This is good if you have to sit in an airport wondering where in the world and what is happening to the expected flight (also good for people collecting passengers from baggage claim and even better most other information that might be useful).O.  MyQR Code - You will understand once you acquire this one (see I.)P.  My Tracks - If the THRiVE can get a GPS signal, the track across the ground/highway/trail will be shown - map and terrain is optional because the developers forgot that internet connection is not pervasive.Q.  Kayak - Ah, I just love the multiple cities option and all the better \"traveler\" places to search for hotel, car, and plane reservations.  These folks are responsive to a user's thoughts, comments and feedback.R.  WeatherBug - Get the version for Honeycomb.  These folks are responsive to a user's thoughts, comments and feedback.S.  USA TODAY for Tablet - I am still looking.  It fills the gap for now.T.  Norton Snap QR Code Reader, Norton Anti-Theft Plugin, Mobile Utilities & Task Killer, and Mobile Security and Antivirus - Keep in mind that some of these offer the complete set of advertised options for an additional subscription fee.  They serve a purpose for me just as they are, for now!U.  20120420 - Additional apps that might be of interest:  BASIC!, Firefox Beta, Google Googles (careful!), Google Sky Map.  Then there is Sketch n Draw that has advertisement; however, just go into \"airplane mode\" to mitigate and enjoy.ANDROID APPS (Of no use or ... )ZZ1.  Adobe Photoshop Express - it is a social media tool that does not allow me to do what I want.  If social media web sites are used, it might be okay?BAD AppsZZ2.  Videos - It is a Google app.  It cannot be uninstalled.  It just arrived a day or so ago.  Even though I might like it (?), Google gives me no choice in the matter and appears to think everyone should have this.  I suppose it is in the fine print, somewhere, so ... .20120420 - Google+ became the user environment that added a lot of features of absolutely no interest to me.  It was a disappointment that Google just did this, ... again, its probably in the fine print ... .  Then, there is also Google Play Books.

The Thrive is IMHO THE BEST TABLET AVAILABLE, including all other choices - Androids, iOS(Apple iPad), webOS(HP), etc. For me, the things that set it apart from ALL other tablets are its solid construction,  great design, and all it's connections/ports (removable battery, full size HDMI port, full size USB 2.0 and a mini USB port. You can take your SDXC/SDHC card right out of your camera and plug it in to the Thrive.  And Toshiba provides a great set of accessories if you want even more connections - like a dock, additional batteries - swappable without tools, just a lock on the back of the tablet.  Try that on an iPad!  The display is outstanding, it beats the iPad. The touch screen response is great. I get true multi-tasking with the Tegra dual-core processor, plus HARDWARE ACCELERATED  Adobe Flash and high quality gaming powered by NVIDIA GeForce.  The rubber and ribbed back make it really easy to hold, and it wont slide around on a hard surface like those rounded backed tablets. A tablet should be an integral part of your home network and this tablet offers more inter-operabilty with everything else I have.  For me,it is inter-operable with my HTC Incredible Phone, My Windows7 and Linux PCs, my Multimedia systems - TVs and Home Theater. I also added a Verizon MiFi 3G to my Thrive carry-bag, so my thrive has a 3g connection, so i can even THRIVE in my car while I am waiting for my wife to finish her shopping.Toshiba Thrive 10.1-Inch 32 GB Android Tablet AT105-T1032 BlackI went with the 32gb model, but with an SD slot and all these connections, the 16GB model is also a great choice at under $500. To get equivalent capabilities with an iPad I would have had to add a lot of accessory connectors and additional devices.  And I would still not get the flexibility Android offers.", "Date": "July 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Thrive has arrived!", "Author": "B. Hines \"bwebmasta\"", "ReviewID": "RX2DMZ0I7P0KV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Toshiba Thrive has introduced something no other pad on the market has: expansion on ALL ports, and a user replaceable battery. These areas along make the tablet stand out, but..how does it stack up to competition and daily use?DisclaimerI have tested and played around with all the other tablets on the market in the \"10 inch\" class such as the Samsung Tab, Asus Transformer, iPad2, Zoom, and the Acer Iconia.User ExperienceFrom a holistic standpoint, the Thrive is a very user friendly device, responsive, and versatile. As with Droid based devices, the screens are customizable with many widgets to choose from and of course that can be downloaded. The Thrive with it's rubber back feels very solid and well built. Sidenote: I have to admit; the Samsung Tab felt more like a wafer and was very slick. I did not feel very comfortable with it, is respect to that area.ScreenThe screen on the Thrive is capacitive, and at a 1280 resolution it is very vibrant and crisp. I know that some users complain about the brightness, but you can adjust the auto bright to suit whatever settings you like. I would suggest getting a screen cover as the screen does pickup fingerprints. The response time is amazing on this device, and the sensitivity is spot on.Battery LifeThe battery life on the Thrive has so far been about 7-8 hours with normal to heavy use. Light use, I have been able to leave the Thrive off the charger for a 24 hour period. Keep in mind, battery life goes according to what settings you have configured. For example, with the screen on full brightness, the battery will go down quicker. Apply some common sense in this regard. One of the shining points, is of course you can change the battery yourself in about 5 minutes flat.AppsI have been able to install apps and widgets that would suit just about anyone's needs. Apps are available anywhere from DirecTV to Fruit Ninja, to Quickoffice and back to Angry Birds. The Thrive has 2 different app stores, one for the Android market, and Toshiba. I have seen some reviews with complaints about that, just wanted to note it. True enough, there are some apps that are not available just yet such as Hulu and Netflix but those are not a deal-breaker to me. I use the tablet for fun and business use and it suits quite well with apps loaded and ones that are available.EmailI can look at GMail, pop, and exchange based email without any issues. Real short and quick in this area, seems some question about the different email functionality.PhysicsThe Thrive is a full 10.1 screen size, and the bezel actually makes it feel better with a little more width on the screen size. The weight at 1.6 lbs is still light, a mere 3 ounces more than the Samsung and many other pads on the market. The width, which some are making a big deal of, is just .6 inches. Just over half an inch...some people will just find anything to whine about. Overall, the Thrive is a solid built tablet, and is more rugged than most tablets on the market. If the additional 3 ounces is acceptable, this is the tablet for you.PortsThe ports. The almighty ports, full and mini usb, full HDMI, and full SD? What more can you ask for? The ports is what sets this tablet apart, the options are where it's at. The Thrive can accept hard drives, usb keys, keyboards, mice, printers which is amazing. One note though, your drives must be in FAT, FAT32, and exFAT format currently. NTFS is not supported just yet. The beauty is, you can have your files in the cloud or full control on the tablet with your own devices. Pictures on your SD go right from the camera to the tablet. Music, etc., great. The file manager is awesome. I know some may say this is not important, but it is vital to me. Oh to add, no adapters or strings attached. Excellent addition, Toshiba!In closing, the Thrive is an awesome device and brings a cumulative package of uses with it. On the hard disk size, you have to make that determination, I went with the 32GB. Remember, part of the disk space is used by the OS and Apps. Initially, I bought the 16GB, but after checking, only 12GB of space was left for use, so keep this in mind. I have not had any issues with my Thrive, but make sure to update your tablet when you get it and HARD REBOOT it after the updates. This is very important, and it does resolve the sleep issue. If you want a device with full expansion, and customization that can meet entertainment and business needs the Thrive does it.***Update 12.18.11*** I am still going strong on the Thrive, great tablet. Toshiba has released 3.2 for the Thrive, which fixed several things, which includes being able to read NTFS formats on SD and USB. So be sure to keep your tablet updated.", "Date": "August 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fine Product", "Author": "Skyhound", "ReviewID": "R3E7K7ZJA7JSM7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Toshiba Thrive 10.1-Inch 16 GB Android Tablet AT105-T1016My NEEDS AND SEARCHI have wanted a tablet since late last fall when I realized that I could really use something with this form factor. I have two primary needs. Around the house I wanted to be able to sit on the couch while watching TV or out on my deck and browse the web, read email, etc. My other use is on trips. I don't travel often enough to warrant the cost of a data plan for a mobile phone, and phones are tiny and difficult to use anyhow. I wanted something I could use comfortably on a plane or in a hotel room to stay connected. A tablet is perfect for these things.My search began with the iPad, but I am not an Apple fan because the way they control everything. The iPad is great for impressing people, but I wanted a tool. The iPad is single-tasking and works like a large phone. What I was looking for was more of a small laptop. I considered the Xoom very seriously, but they released it before it was ready so I held off. The Transformer looked great, but the many complaints about build quality kept me away. The Samsung 10.1 looked good too, but by then I realized that I wanted full sized ports and it came to my attention than none of these had user-replaceable batteries. The HP looks nice but I was turned off by the proprietary OS. I think Android is more likely to grow and have more apps available. It was a long wait, but in the end the Thrive was the first tablet that I felt comfortable buying.I have had the 16GB Thrive for two weeks now.SIZE, WEIGHT AND FEELI was very concerned about the weight of the Thrive. So I got two books, one the same weight of the Thrive and one the weight of the Samsung and I carried them around with me. What I discovered is that both tablets are too heavy to hold in one hand for a long time. For general carrying around or placement in the lap, the difference in weight didn't matter. If you buy the Toshiba case for you will feel that it is very well protected. But the unit+case is also heavy and bulky. It;s like carrying a textbook around. I find that I leave the case on the table and plop the unit into it while eating or when I don't have both hands available. But most of the time I leave it out of the case. This makes it seem small and lightweight in comparison. I find the wide edges to be a plus when holding it and my left thumb is well aligned with the \"Back\" button, which is the most often used control. The grooved back gives me a sense of security; I feel that I am not going to drop it.ANDROID OSAndroid is actually very nice. I takes some getting used to that you never close anything. But most \"open\" programs don't really stay open in the background; they are saved and then re-opened in the same state as before. This is clever and works quickly and seamlessly. I have found that the primary apps I need are there. I wish Skype supported video calling, but that is in the works. I like being able to customize the wallpaper and move shortcuts and widgets around. It does not appear that there is a way to uninstall the pre-installed apps. But this is only a minor annoyance except for the most control oriented. You can delete the shortcuts. I like the widget capability and the images for instant access to bookmarks.APPSThere are some really good news apps: Pulse and News360. I tried LogMeIn to access my Windows 7 desktop but it is very awkward to use. This could be a life saver on the road if I needed a file from my computer though. Google Maps and Google Earth work well. There are utilities available to display the GPS data and nearby Wi-fi. I can play my MP3s from the Amazon cloud drive and they sound very good in headphones. There is a version of Adobe Reader. The Movies app works great for researching nearby movies and theaters.CAMERASThe front facing camera works ok outdoors in in very well lighted locations. It doesn't replace a camera though. Indoors the picture quality is poor and there is a very long shutter lag. But if I didn't have my camera around and had the Thrive available it could be very handy.The rear-facing camera works ok for video calls via Google, but as with all tablets it suffers badly from the camera angle while holding it. It often looks like you are filming yourself from a camera located in your crotch! Holding it close for a full-face shot is difficult because of the parallax from the camera, which is located on the side (or top).BUILD QUALITYThe thinner tablets tend to flex a bit, but this one feels solid. I have had no concerns or problems.SCREENIt is important to know that the Thrive ships with an auto-brightness feature that is on by default. The screen doesn't jump out at you with lots of contrast when this is enabled. But it is easily disabled, and then the screen looks just as bright and nice as all the others. They all use pretty much the same technology after all. But I find that when enabled the battery life is greatly extended, so I turned it back on. It may not impress passers-by this way, but it is just as functional. The screen really shows the fingerprints after a while. But I solved this easily by applying a screen protector (military shield).16 GB STORAGEI was concerned that 16 GB wouldn't be enough, but I have installed tons of apps and barely filled it.PORTS AND SDI doubled my storage with a fast 16GB SD card. It just works. As far as I know you can't install apps on it, but it works well for media. The card does protrude just a bit from the top/side, but it is in an area where you don't generally have your hand.I connected an HDMI cable to my 46\" HDTV and then watched a home movie from a USB drive attached to the Thrive. I transferred the movie to the USB from my Windows 7 desktop. Worked fine. The HDMI is the same resolution as the screen, so it is not 1080p. I even played a few games connected to the TV.OVERALL PERFORMANCEI have not found myself wishing it were faster, with one exception. It does take 20-30 seconds to boot up. I don't know how this compares to other tablets. If just sleeping, it awakens instantly. Browsing with Chrome can sometimes be a little slow for complex pages. If the unit is running slowly overall, it can always be traced to having too many tabs open in the Browser which is running in the background. Video display well from the web and YouTube, as do my own movies.PROBLEMSI have used the Thrive for an average of about 4 hours per day. I have experienced the sleep problem once (I am running the latest update as of July 19). I had to hold the power button down for about ten seconds to make it reboot. I have had a few apps shut down, but not very often. Other than the one sleep issue I have never had the unit reboot or need to force a reboot.BATTERYAfter six hours of use I usually have about a quarter of the battery left. I have yet to use it for so long that I ran out of power. Easily recharged overnight. Leaving the auto-brightness enabled increases the battery life.PREINSTALLED SOFTWAREThe File Manager is a very nice feature and works well. Using the \"Market\" to download apps is simple and straight forward. The Chrome browser is sometimes slow, particularly when typing.ADDITIONAL HARDWAREThe built-in GPS, compass, and other sensors seem to work as they should. Not all tablets come with the full suite of hardware inside, so that is another plus for the Thrive.EXTERNAL SWITCHESThe power and volume switches are too difficult to find by touch alone. The volume is particularly annoying. I find that I often have to tip the unit up to find where to press, and being close to the power there is some concern I will get that by mistake, but so far this has yet to actually happen. The volume adjusts too quickly for my taste.SOUNDThe speakers are small and the sound a bit tinny as with all mobile devices, though they seem better than many after you adjust the equalizer. Sounds great in headphones.SUMMARYThe Thrive does what I needed it to do and overall I am very happy with it. It has been fun to use, with only a few annoyances along the way. I am very satisfied with my purchase. No regrets. I'd have given it five stars but I feel that should be for only the very best of the best and all tablets are in their infancy today.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Why the Toshiba Thrive is sooo much better than the Apple IPAD 2", "Author": "M.

New Android 3.1, Honeycomb Operating System awesome!  What Toshiba has added such as the Toshiba Media Player, just add to the wonderfulness.I have had the IPAD 2 since the beginning of September and liked it at first..... then the limitations just blew me away!-Example when emailing with the IPAD 2, I cannot attach files from different locations.  Instead I have to open the app, choose my document or picture and then email it from there.  If I have more than one attachment, I have to send separate emails for each!  This is just silly!-With the Thrive I open my email, be it gmail or outlook or any other acct. that I may have created, compose an email and click on attach and voila!  I have access to most of the folders in my Thrive.  So instead of opening each program, I open the folder where my document or picture is and attach.  I can do this numerous times using the same email that I am composing!  Wonderful!!!!-Another limitation with the IPAD 2 is the keyboard.  I can only use the IPAD keyboard.  If I want to convert handwriting to text, I have to buy an app such as Phat Pad, use the handwriting to text capability, then copy and paste into a word document or email.  You can use speech to text with the Dragon app but again.....  you have to copy and paste into the program that you want it in.  Again this is just silly!-With the Thrive I can download an app such as the Tflex-9, which uses all of the following:  - handwriting to text - Dragon speech to text - and a keyboard that has slide capability for selecting numbers or other symbols.  This will work in all the programs that I open in the Thrive.  I do not have to copy and paste.  Another cool keyboard is the Thumb Keyboard which splits the keyboard so that your fingers don't have to stretch to the middle of the tablet and it also has arrow keys that are sometimes just so much more convenient then selecting with your finger.-The Thrive does not have Netflix yet but it does have ADOBE FLASH support unlike the IPAD 2.  How irritating is that!  Especially when you go to the news sites on the web and you want to watch a news video.... OOPS.... YOU CAN'T DO THAT WITH THE IPAD!!!!.-I could go on and on.  I find the features on the HONEYCOMB OPERATING SYSTEM, once you discover them all, because there are many, just so much more convenient than the IPAD 2.  Not to mention what TOSHIBA  has added to the mix.-Oh! But wait, I almost forgot about Ports & Expansions - HDMI port (full-sized) for 720p video output - 2 USB ports (1 full-sized, 1 mini-USB) - Dock connector port  and - Secure Digital (SD) card slot, compatible with SD, SDHC, and SDXC media.  You can download documents with a thumb drive, as well as pictures.  You can transfer your music or back up the music you have purchased onto the thumb drive.  I mean, really.... How convenient is that!-My husband, who also has an IPAD 2,  bought the Camera Connection Kit and when he plugged the SD card from his camera into it, the IPAD indicated that there were no pictures on it!  So what is the purpose?  What a waste.  It may have been defective, but why should we have to buy so many accessories!-My husband and I have been so frustrated with our IPAD 2s that we finally broke down and invested in the TOSHIBA THRIVE.  The price was great and the case we got for it was very reasonable and fits quite well without adding tons of weight. (BLUREX Leather ULTRA-SLIM folio Case With convertible StandWhat more can I say.

Don't have a smart phone - think the surfing and apps are cool, but that screen is just too small for my middle-aged eyes.What I wantedI was looking for a tablet pc for three main things - surf the web, serve as an e-reader and that had a real USB port that I could use to download and backup photos from my old digital SLR camera. Note the camera uses compact flash memory, not micro SD, so I can't use that to transfer the photos.  I had previously bought and returned the eLocity A7 Android tablet because I couldn't get it to do the things I wanted.  Don't like the whole concept of the controlled Apple world plus the IPAD lacks a real USB port though you can get an adapter.OverallI've been very happy with the Thrive.  The screen looks great and the touch features work smoothly.  It's a little heavier than some others, but I generally rest it on my lap so that's not an issue.  Haven't had the dreaded not waking from sleep issue.  The file manager that's included is straightforward and easy to use.  I was able plug in my camera and copy files with no problems.  Also, I added 32 GB more memory using a standard card, which can be swapped out if necessary.  There aren't a huge number of apps yet, but they include enough to make it immediately useful and the number is growing.Minor annoyancesAs others have mentioned, the on/off button is inconvenient to find, especially in low light.You can't close apps without turning off the tablet - though this may be a function of Honeycomb.You can't delete the included programs, but really they don't take up much space.It doesn't come with any directions except a small startup pamphlet.  Typical, I know, but would it hurt them to include a pdf on the tablet with more details?  FYI, here is a link to an Android 3 manual [...]Here's a link to the Thrive manual  [...]AppsComes with a fine file manager and browser.  There is also a gallery program to review photos and a bunch of solitaire type games.  The maps app is really great - it works with the gps system so you don't have to be in wifi range to use it.  It also can be used to get directions or look for restaurants etc near you.I have so far downloaded Kindle and Aldiko book readers which both work fine.  Also got a free photoshop lite program to do simple photo editing.  And I'm afraid I'm already addicted to Crazy Birds.There is a list of optimized to Honeycomb programs here[...]Sadly, Netflix doesn't yet work, but hopefully will soon.Bottom LineI've had the Thrive for a couple of weeks and it can already do all the things I was looking for and more.

Gutierrez", "ReviewID": "R2R1HXVO5NI866", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After about a month of research, comparing $270-$600 tablets (iPad2, Acer A500, MSI Windpad, Coby Kyros 1024) and $800 17\" Core i7 laptops, I decided on the Thrive as a mobile solution based on all the reviews I have read on Amazon despite the fact I am totally new to Android.  It's the only unit I couldn't demo among my list.  I definitely like the rubberized back compared to the Acer's aluminum backing.  The Thrive feels like it is more durable and scratch resistant than the Acer.  I don't think it is heavy at all, it is thicker, but I like it that way.  iPad feels too thin that I might bend it or forget I am holding it because it is too light.  The Kyros I tried, had too few reviews online, I figured there might be too little community support.  The Windpad the was most expensive, it didn't really feel right to me.The good news was that the Thrive worked perfectly right out of the box (I did not update the OS by the way).  I have installed through the \"market\" icon a number of free games/apps (Angry Birds), Webster Dictionary.  I also installed Documents to Go 3, OfficeSuite Pro, QuickOffice, and sad to say none of them can display correctly any powerpoint animations I made on MS Office 2007.  Maybe I am not using them right.I bought a few accessories like a tablet stand from connectland for about $9.  It allows me to tilt the tablet the way you would a laptop screen.  Crude, but it works.  I connected a keyboard and a mouse through a USB Hub, works fine, a mouse pointer appeared on the tablet.  I installed a FAT32 formatted 16GB SD card, the tablet found its contents immediately through the \"file manager\" icon.I did have a hard time making it talk via Wi-Fi to my Linksys WRT54G Router.  If you have the same router, try these settings to save you the trial and error:SSID Broadcast - enabled, Security Mode - WPA2 Personal, WPA Algorithms - TKIP+AES, WPA Shared Key - \"your password\", MAC Filtering - enabled (you can find the Thrive MAC in settings/about tablet/status).  On the Thrive, goto settings/wireless networks/add Wi-Fi network.I have also tried the voice input, cool.  If you click on the mic icon on the browser, and say \"google.com\", well, the browser will take you to google.com without typing it.  Did I mention I am completely new to Android?  It didn't take me that long to figure out the interface.  I like it!Some people have been complaining about the tablet not waking up, I don't have that problem.  When the tablet goes to sleep (default is about 2 minutes), you wake it up by pressing the power button a few seconds, it won't wake up by tapping the screen, but it seems it will wake up through the USB keyboard after a few keystrokes.Bottom line, I believe I made the right choice, I am happy with the purchase.  Even my sister who owns an iPad2 thinks the Thrive is a better tablet.", "Date": "July 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "My 2 cents is - superb tablet, here's why...", "Author": "Bron \"Bron\"", "ReviewID": "R72DVB7J97PAY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OK, so I won't rehash here all the stuff you can read in the other reviews, I'll just give you my impressions after my hands on with my new Thrive.  Note that I also own an iPad (32 GB 3G/Wifi) and several other smaller android devices and e-readers, netbooks, etc.; so I have some comparisons to judge by.Let's cut to the chase, I love the Thrive.  Up and running in 5 minutes flat (or less).  And after about 5 hours of fooling with it, it's everything I hoped it would be and meets my expectations in full.  Now time will tell, but at this point, I am thrilled.  It's comparable in size and weight to my iPad, I notice little difference as far as weight or thickness, indeed, I like the Thrive's grippy rubber backing.  No need to buy one (rubber backing/case) like I had to do with my iPad.In comparing the screens, I also see little difference as far as sharpness, color, viewing angles, and so on.  I do like the iPad's format better.  For a tablet, the added width in the vertical orientation seems like a plus to me.  That said, I did not notice any issues while using the Thrive, though I do prefer using it in landscape orientation for most things.  Some apps make vertical a better choice, of course.  So, to me, the Thrive is every bit in the same league as the iPad.  Personally, I prefer the thicker, sturdy format, that's why I bought my iPad when iPad 2 came out.  I wanted the iPad, not the iPad 2.  For same reason, I did not like the Galaxy.  Just personal preference, of course.Why did I get a Thrive then?  Because I chafe under the \"Apple Prison\" and restrictions of the iPad.  While having control does have some advantages, for someone like me who likes flexibility, it's a losing proposition.  No standard ports?  No easy way to load and play all my various video formats, iTunes is fine, but irks me sometimes.So when I saw the Thrive with Bluetooth (a must for me), 2 full USB ports, full SD card, and a full HDMI port, plus the File Manager and easy ways to share and deal with files (i.e. like every other darn device does except the iPad!), it caught my attention.  A lot of research and a shot at a discount off an already good price and -- sold!Out of the box, everything has worked fine and it's even better than I had hoped.  The screen seems great, decent black levels (important to me), and it is extremely easy to use.  With limited previous Android experience, I find 3.1 to be a great OS, very intuitive.  I have been able to figure out everything and personally feel it is easier to use than the iPad in many ways.  Very happy with it.  The speakers have very good stereo separation, thought they are definitely treble oriented (like every other tablet).  What do you expect from tiny speakers?  Still, I had no trouble watching YouTube vids.  For better sound, I fired up one of my portable bluetooth stereo speakers and they paired easily and worked great.  Much better bass and mid-range.  Headphones sound great as well.  As does my ZVOX audio system via my Bluetooth receiver there.  So good sound is not an issue.  (Tried it this with Creative Labs blutooth speaker system and it works well and sounds fantastic: Creative ZiiSound D3x Modular Wireless Speaker System (51MF8120AA002))As I said, even using the auto-brightness, I find the screen quite good and see no issues with it.  The buttons all work great.  I had no problems locating and using the power button as some have mentioned.  Heck, it's right between the battery and WiFi LEDs, so not hard to locate.  Much easier to use than the power button on the ipad in my opinion.  Having the orientation lock is a nice feature. Just ask all the ipad users when Apple messed with that on the iPad. ;)So, absolutely great design.  This is the power user's tablet, yet so easy to use, I think anyone would like it. Very snappy performance...as good or better than iPad.  Battery life seems fine to me.  No trouble getting 7-8 hours or more without trying.  Good enough for me.  I'm sure with a little effort I could get 10 or better.  Basically, you can use this all day long under normal circumstances.  Charges very quickly as many have noted. Swappable batteries, so no issues there.  The ipad is awesome with 12-14 hours easily.)I can run my Amazon Cloud player on it, as well as Pandora and many other music apps.  Nice!  Covers that.  Mobo app will play about any video.  Included YouTube app plays YouTube HD videos well and they look super.  Built-in apps good enough for most things, especially audio.  Maps app works very well.  Looks superb on this nice screen.  Again, as good as iPad in my opinion.  Web browsing works very well, superior to iPad in all respects.  Performance, plus flash, and ease of use.  Not a huge deal, but nice since that's a major use for me.And just so well designed and easy to use.  I keep coming back to that because that's what kept jumping out to me as I explored the Thrive.  I have yet to do any updates and everything is working great.  I might not even update for awhile as I'm not sure I need to at this point.  It's working fine for everything and I have not had any issues so far (of course, I have only used it for 5 or 6 hours, so need more time really.  I may just wait for 3.2 to be released.  (2011-11-19 Have now done one update, no major changes, everything still works fine. Just some minor tweaks.)Having the full size SD card was another big feature for me.  I just popped in a 32 GB SDHC card with a ton of my mp3's on it and everything works as expected.  Being able to back up data to your Google account and the SD card, a USB stick, or hard drive is a definite plus as well.I've had good luck with Toshiba products over the years and this will, hopefully, be no exception.  Well designed and well built.  As I get more time with it, I will come back and update this review if anything significant develops. (2011-11-19 -- 3 months and still loving it.)I like the iPad a lot, but feel the Thrive is every bit the equal, and is even better in many respects.  Much greater connectivity and flexibility and that's very important as it means there's a lot more things you'll be able to do with your Thrive.  By the way, the included NFS Shift game demo worked great and looked good.This baby has the right mix of features for me and is a great value.  So, kudos Toshiba!  The Thrive is a winner!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*** 2011-11-04 update:  This wireless touchpad/keyboard device works with the Thrive: Wireless Ultra-mini Touchpad Keyboard (VP6364) -- I have both and this unit was truly \"plug and play\" (see my review on the prod page) and everything worked as expected, touchpad, mouse buttons, keyboard, media keys, etc. all worked fine.  Not something most people will need, but thought a few might benefit from knowing this.  If you are a fearsome thumber, you might like it.  I like it mainly for the media controls (play/pause., vol up/down, prev/next song, and so on).*** 2011-11-19 Have had my Thrive about 3 months now and I remain very satisfied with it.  No issues, works well, using it more all the time.  Gmail works great, better than on my laptop. GPS, maps and navigation work very well.  Battery holds its charge and lasts a long time.  Video, Music, Browsing are all fine, so I would still recommend this as a good choice if you like the feature mix (which I do).  I got this leather case with flap/stand which works well for me and is cheap: Poetic Slimbook Leather Case for Toshiba Thrive 10.1-Inch Android Tablet, Black**** 2012-03-10 update:  Many tablets come, many go.  I remain very happy with my thrive.  ;)----P.S.  Haven't mentioned the cameras.  That's because I see no real use for them and have not bothered to play with them.  They could leave them off and cut the price as far as I am concerned.  I have really good cameras and video cams if I need video or photos.  Don't need my tablet for that.  (OK, the cams work fine for occasional use.)But I do need the GPS!  That's a nice plus I didn't mention above.  (GPS works great!)P.P.S.  About the apps advantage iPad has.  Yes, many hundreds of thousands more apps.  But I only need about 12 or so.  Feel sure Android apps will continue to grow and I'll have what I need.  iPad has almost too many choices. ;)", "Date": "August 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Geek tablet user review", "Author": "Eric Laffoon \"ubergeek\"", "ReviewID": "R23FCURG0QD3VB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've actually been using Android and Android tablets a while, since the first Archos Android tablet (gen 7) in 2009 and I have their 7 and 10 inch Froyo tablets. Archos has announced new tablets for September with Honeycomb and I will most likely be buying at least one, for reasons that will be apparent. I was going to order the 8 GB but found the 16 GB in stock at Best Buy no waiting.My other tablets seemed fast when I got them, and now seemed not so fast. I wanted to try Honeycomb and also develop software on it. Initially I thought the Galaxy Tab would be the thing to have, but no SD? Come on?  The Transformer and Iconia also looked interesting. The Xoom was too spendy for something I'd want to replace by next year when the really fast tablets come out, and SD card not working... Seriously. While I was thinking of the Transformer I saw the Thrive. Simple. Full size SDXC, 'nuff said! Full size ports are nice but the replaceable battery is also nice. After my Archos experience I'm not overly impressed with the battery, but the charge time of about an hour is fast.First off Honeycomb takes a little getting used to, but it's really addictive and slick. As a Linux user the USB MTP choice seemed initially obtuse as I always use USB mass storage, but it seems there are reasons. Keep in mind if you run Linux file transfers require either getting mtpfs working, using adb or some other option. Media playing offers Toshiba enhancements but suffers various issues. First up is the Tegra II decode limitations. It will play formats listed here, if everything is encoded the way it likes. This is where Archos shines and why their next tablet with an TI OMAP 4460 will really make Tegra II devices look silly. Thankfully you can use Mobo for software decoding and while some people say it isn't smooth my experience has been great with mobo playing my videos. The audio sounds great for clarity and quality but the speakers lack bass and are tinny. With this much body space they could have put a mini subwoofer in there. I've seen good and bad said about the screen, but my opinion is the screen is great with amazing viewing angles and clarity. However if you leave it in auto it seems a little dim.Problems so far have been with UPnP and sharing files with my PC. In fairness I'm not sure how much is the Thrive as I seem to have odd things going on with my Pogoplug UPnP and am trying to get Samba working right on my Linux box. I have had some wake up problems where I had to reboot a few times. Over all it has been absolutely delightful. The cameras are not great, as mentioned by others, but I have a nice camera I can plug in and use this for a viewer.The real strong point of this tablet has to be the web browsing. Sure there isn't a Netflix Honeycomb app, and I'd love to see streaming on Tegra devices, but I opened the browser and and managed my queue easily. That would really choke up my single core tablet. The other thing is that this is the first device that is faster than my Galaxy S phone that I can show people things with in a fast paced environment without waiting. The photo features for viewing and editing are first class and I haven't even tried the movie maker yet.This is not the thinnest or the lightest tablet, but you can buy an 8 GB unit cheap and then add 128 GB SDXC later and carry a 256 GB USB stick for a lot of video to go. As development continues it and more software arrives this tablet is only going to get better.", "Date": "July 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Finally a tablet that's like a laptop", "Author": "Emagic", "ReviewID": "R1EQE8225YA4PI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OK, OK, OK....this Toshiba Thrive is the best tablet out. I could have gotten the top 3 other highend tablets, but I wanted more than a pretty, thin tablet that will slip out of my large rugged manly hands and be one with the floor.

OK let get to it, full size SD Card port and supports up to 128gb, a full and mini USB port, a full size HDMI port, screen lock which is a good thing to have to prevent screen from rotating. Android 3.1, Honeycomb, did I mention first mobile super-chip, NVIDIA\u00ae Tegra 2. Stupid fast. I have tested every port, blu-tooth keyboard and all worked flawlessly. I synced to my PC through the mini USB and transfering file was a breeze. Try that with the other top 3. I love this tablet. Sure it's a bit thicker, but you feel it in your hands. Sure it's a bit heavier, but with all it offer it is well worth the minor sacrifice.

I would have to spend extra money on the Transformer to get the connectivity the Thrive has built in and the ability to be able and replace the battery  are what help me make my final decision. All the Android tablets have the same guts so it's going to be how the manufacturer presents them that's going to sell you their tablet. I think Toshiba thought further into the future making full USB and full SD slots built in as well as the user serviceable battery. The screen on the Thrive looks good and can be viewed from just about any angle. It responds very quickly to the touch - I've noticed PDFs have a little lag while Kindle books are super fast. Loaded the Zino Magazine Reader app and it works good and the magazines show and perform nicely on this tablet. Web surfing is nice but you still fumble from time to time. If you encounter a page that has an excessive amount of Flash ads, it may crash the browser or slow the load down to nothing (using the default browser). Video playback was helped by a recent Toshiba update (August 3, 2011) where they added or updated the CODECs. But I still had issues playing back video. I had to enable \"Soft-Decoding\" in Moboe Player to get audio with the video and smooth out the playback. Plus, people have to remember that these Android tablets have high resolution screens, if you're playing a lower resolution video, the player tries to fill the screen and that will make the video appear a little fuzzy. Check all this before complaining about ugly video playback. All the Android tablets have these issues - I think it's more of an OS issue but I'm confident that the OS will grow and mature quickly. Another thing that help set the Thrive apart was that Toshiba has a great user forum website that has helped me transition to using a tablet for daily use. But remember too, this is not a computer or laptop replacement.  If you approach any of these tablets with this as your main reason for purchasing one, you're going to be disappointed. These tablets are a gadget first but help fill a small gap that lets people do simple tasks without the trouble of booting up a laptop. Things like checking email, surfing some web pages, read a book or newspaper/magazine and running some simple apps. You could do some pretty productive stuff with a tablet but you're not going to get all the functionality of a computer with it. It took me some time to quit looking for the \"laptop\" performance and settle to the tablet speed of things. (Just my opinion of course '. ) Bottom line, I would recommend the Thrive to anyone looking for a tablet because you get the added ports that help the transition between a laptop and a tablet.", "Date": "August 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Security Software Issue", "Author": "jpharper999", "ReviewID": "R1WISJ1CFH362M", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have owned my Toshiba Thrive for a few months now and only run across a single issue. It may seem small to some users but I for one have to think it is a serious issue.Toshiba pre-installed the Kaspersky Security Software on their Toshiba Thrive line of tablets in the form of a 30 day trial. At the end of the trial period, the software regularly displays a message stating that the user must purchase a yearly subscription from Kaspersky in order to continue to use the software. Since the software was pre-installed by Toshiba, there is no way for the user to uninstall the software or turn the notification messages off. Also, users may not install another Security software product without experiencing conflicts between the two. According to Toshiba, the only way to remove the software is to \"ROOT\" the device at which point Tohiba will not support the deviceOne suggestion. If you purchase this Tablet, Do not activate the Kaspersky trial unless you intend to purchase the yearly subscription.

I found out it is a VERY LOW priority.All I asked them to do is ship me a working unit and I will ship them back the one that is DOA. They told me \"No, we cannot do that\", that I would have to send this one in for repair, which will cost me shipping fees and insurance ( because UPS will only cover the 1st $100.00) So now I not only paid for a DOA unit to begin with, but will have to add another 20-40 bucks more to the cost to ship then their own brick back.Plus I have wasted one screen protector at like 10.00 a pop.

What makes the Thrive stand out among all the other Android tablets is its price, external storage options, file manager app and full size ports. Now that Android 3.2 is out we'll see more tablets with SD card slots but this was one of the first and it is a must have feature for anyone with a decent sized music and video collection. The full size USB port is just icing on top. You have to love a tablet that can use a thumb drive. The file manager app makes keeping track of all your files easy. Lastly you have to love the price point. Now some of the not so great parts are its size, it's thicker than most tablets. It's battery is small compared to the competition so you are looking at a couple days of moderate use on a single charge. I should also mention another plus is it comes free of a lot of bloatware and a clean install of Android. That should make the jump to ICS sooner rather than later.

However, if you feel it's not as bright and as vivid as you'd like - switch to manual.Battery life - just excellent. It exceeds anything I've encountered. I've been using my tablet for a whole day heavily and never get it under 40% of charge in 1 day.Ports - probably the best feature of this tablet especially when you're using it in different situations rather than just watch the movie and browse internet. I can plug any USB device for a file transfer, any keyboard if I need to do heavy typing for which touch keyboard is not the best solution, etc., etc. USB card from my DSLR goes right in so I can check pictures in the field on a bigger screen, etc.Downside:only 2 so far (and neither one would be a fair reason to lower the 5-star mark):1. It's thick and heavy compared to other tablets. It is. No doubt about it. You would not want to lay in bed and read it as e-book reader unless your hands are crazy strong. In 10 min you'd want to lay it down on something or get some kind of support.It's so thick compared to Transformer or iPad that you feel like it's a netbook rather than a tablet and kind of expect for keyboard to slide out of it.However, there is a price to pay for a full-blown laptop set of ports + incredible battery life. I rather carry my Thrive that is thick and heavy than have a light and slick iPad and look frustrated at USB stick of full size SD card that has some data I need and no way to get them.2. There is a WiFi problem. However, this problem is not specific to the Thrive. It's an Android issue with Netgear routers. I have the same with my Samsung Infuse Android 2.1 phone. Both devices have DHCP problems with some newer Netgear routers. I guess it's more Netgear issue than anything because there are no problems with Linksys or DLink.Overall, if I used the tablet just for entertainment - movie, browsing, book reading, occasional e-mail, etc. I'd pick up something thinner and lighter. However, since I want to be able to review my photos, edit presentations, word docs, spreadsheets when need to - Thrive is an excellent choice.On that note - get Ghost Commander with Samba extension from the Market and you can exchange files with Windows servers on your network seamlessly.

The stereo speakers and SRS Sound Enhancement software that Toshiba incorporated is a nice addition, allowing the tablet to produce powerful sound that isn't dull or sound like its coming from a tin can. The only thing this tablet lacks is mobile broadband support, but with its full size USB 2.0 port, you could easily plug in a mobile broadband USB adapter from your wireless carrier of choice.

Especially the full size SD slot, USB and HDMI.* Wi-Fi was very easy to setup, it picked up my network, typed in my Pre-Shared Key and it logged in right away.* Wireless Speed: My Comcast speed is supposed to offer 12Mbps, testing wireless devices about 2 feet away from router, iPod's 802.11g is 9.82Mbps, hardwired desktops are 12.59Mbps, while this Thrive tablet's 802.11n is jamming at 23.66Mbps. Don't know why the tablet's wireless is way faster than my hardwired desktops.* With the built-in mic, the voice recognition seems fairly accurate, as long as you speak clearly and not super fast, kind of cool searching the net by talking, instead of typing.* Email is also easy to setup, just typed in my comcast email and password, and it was able prefill all other settings for me.* The textured back does make gripping easier.* Screen can be set to very bright and is very vibrant, with no light bleed.* The screen material seems to be as scratch resistance as the iPod, so I am not using any screen protectors.* Like the power, charging and Wi-Fi indicator lights.* Built-in GPS is cool, but you need Wifi to initially get directions, in-order for the Google Map turn by turn talking GPS to work. Most times it'll find a GPS within less than a couple of minutes, but sometime it just sits there searching.* Feels well built, does not flex anywhere, unlike the Asus Transformer (when you grab it from the thin edges, the plastic tends to flex).Cons/trade offs* Thicker and heavier that the competition, but it does not bother me, guess that's part of the trade off to have full size ports. Especially that I have it in the portfolio case, which makes it even thicker and heavier, but it makes me feel safer when my 4 yr old plays with it.* Back cover is a bit hard to get off.* Power and Volume buttons, have to really either get used to their locations or visually look to press at the right location. Especially the Power button, it's smooth and almost flushed with the side of the case, not raised much at all to allow easy and obvious feel of the button.* If you have it in the Toshiba Portfolio Case, it's almost impossible to open the cover to the USB, HDMI ports, I had to actually take it out of the case to open the cover.* It only supports MP4, so if you have old videos in other formats, most likely they are not supported and you will need to convert them first.* A lot of free apps display ads, sometimes those ads will lead to sites that are not appropriate for kids. The easy solution is to put the tablet into airplane mode while playing those apps, no more ads for anyone to accidentally click on.Andriod v3.1.01.5.0022 issuesTwo main issues that I have come across, which happens intermittently and somewhat often (I'm not the only one, do a Google search and you will find others talking about them on forums), Toshiba is stating that it is an Android issue and that Toshiba is working with Google to  release an update before the end of July 2011 to address the first issue. I'm not sure if they will try to address the second or not.* 1st issue - Standby(Toshiba/Google calls it Timeout), once it goes into timeout, the Power light will glow on and off. For me, typically not right away, it may take a short while, like several hours, I will noticed that the Power light is on steadily, it will not come out of timeout, I then have to power it down and restart, which happens quite frequently. When this happens, since the Power light is on steadily, but the screen is black, it's almost like the system has woken up from timeout on its own, but locked up.* 2nd issue - While plugged into the included AC adapter, after going into timeout mode, out of no where, the system will reboot itself. Since I've had the tablet, I've noticed that it happened 4 or 5 times, I'm sure it's done it more than that, it's just that I did not notice it or was not around at the time. But, it never happens when I'm actually using it, I always use it while unplugged.ConclusionThat's all of the Pros, Cons, and Android issues that I can think of right now. Until Toshiba and Google fixes the two main issues(timeout and reboot), the star rating will stay at 3. If it were not for those 2 issues, I would most likely give it a 4.5. This definitely will not replace a desktop or laptop. At least for me, it'll be more toward reading PDF, browsing the net, checking email, for my kid to play games with and whatever educational apps that I can find for him. If I have to do any serious work, back to my desktop I go.UPDATE 8/3/2011Regarding the sleep and not waking up issue, just updated with the new version of Android from Tosihba, only time can tell, will update again within a few days, to determine if the SOD has been completely fixed or not. Grrrrrr, has been very annoying!!!UPDATE 8/8/2011The sleep issue has been fixed by the update. Now hoping that their will be an update to allow caching of maps with Google Map, so that one does not need wifi to get directions.UPDATE 8/10/2011It's been working perfect after the update as of 8/3/2011. But, starting on 8/8/2011, the sleeping issue happened two days in a row, each time after sleeping overnight. Sending it back for an exchange. After the first update, I changed it to a 4 star, now back to a 3 star, Grrrrr!UPDATE - Right after 8/10/2011I returned the unit and got a brand new replacement from the reseller. The first thing I did was performed a system update with the replacement and since then, I never came across the sleep or rebooting issues again. The only other thing I am still waiting for, is the NetFlix app to stream movies, don't know if it will ever happen, a real bummer!!!UPDATE - 10/20/2011Noticed that Netflix was finally available on this tablet, now am very happy, helps pass the time while I'm on the elliptical machine to burn of those beer calories.UPDATE - 4/13/2013After updating from Honeycomb to Ice Cream Sandwich, the tablet crashes/locks up a lot more now, there is no easy way to roll back and Toshiba has no answer/fix for the update issues.

Android is definitely the best user experience on top of Linux that I've encountered.I'm really just reviewing to put in my thumbs up, given that others have had problems.  I believe Toshiba has worked out the shutdown problems - at least, I've never seen them.  The real question then is do you need a tablet and, if so, iPad or Android.  I find the tablet to be a wonderful companion computer.  I've used an iPad and I really can't see any difference between it and the Android.  The app you want may not be on the Android market yet - or perhaps vice versa.  I have been able to find everything I want, mostly for free - SAMBA client, DLNA client, MP4 AVC/AC3 video player with hardware acceleration.  I usually end up buying the apps just to support the makers.The gizmo is a great little video player, within reason.  Word is that the Tegra 2 does not actually do full HD, though i don't think you need full HD on a device this small.  However, that would be a sticking point, as the Tegra 3 is quite a bit more powerful, and the iPad 3 will be as well.", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Most Functional Tablet", "Author": "Ramzi \"Ramzi\"", "ReviewID": "R3FK0D80SIOZ1T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I should mention that I have used or extensively tested all major brands with the exception of the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10 inches, but including the first Samsung Tab 7 inches.Price: reasonable ... it saves you from buying adapters, so overall it can be on the lower end of the price range.Looks: the Thrive looks much better than the Asus and Acer which both seem old and outdated and seem like they've been used before; it has similar looks to the Xoom. The iPad looks really good, and depending on your mood you might find it nicer sometimes, but other times the Thrive looks rugged and more serious especially in front of your business associates. It feels somewhat silly to show your boss a document on the iPad. The Thrive looks business-like and mature.Weight and size: yes it's heavier than other tablets, but to me this was one of the reasons why I got it. I used the iPad for 1 month and did not know how to hold it, it slips and the only way to be sure is to rest it on something: I had to lock my fingers on it so it won't drop. The Thrive is not heavy at all in absolute terms. The rims are wide and that's good as your fingers don't interfere with your reading.Status lights: not nearly as bad as some have made it to be. In fact I like them, they make the Thrive seem alive and waiting safely for you to use it like a trusted partner.Screen: it has a very good screen, but the iPad has a better screen, also the Samsung Tab 7\" also has a better screen. Its screen is about equal to Acer, Asus and Xoom.Finish: reading some reviews, you'd think that the Thrive is ugly, but it looks much better in real life than on screen. The silver piece on top is not as bad as some made it to be; I don't mind it. Since the back cover is replaceable, Toshiba can make another version with a different color and texture (the bright colors they currently produce do not go well with the color of the front side of the tablet). Nonetheless, I don't normally stare at the back of it!Battery: good to very good. I doubt many people will spend more time using it that what the battery provides in a 24-hour period. If you do, you need to get a life. The replaceable battery is not an issue to me especially that you need to charge the extra battery in the Thrive itself.Sound: this is also another area where I expected a deficiency based on some reviews, but it is loud enough for all practical purposes.Most importantly: function: the Thrive functions beautifully, no hangs, feels right, and speedy.  The ports are fantastic I use them extensively, especially the full USB. I still don't know what better and faster way to move data to any tablet than the USB. It was a pain to move data to the iPad, which severely limits its use. I don't necessarily need certain data permanently on the tablet, and the USB flash memory allows for such flexibility.Note: I believe your particular situation has a lot to do with how much you like your tablet. I am a male, 42 yrs old, have 2 kids, and work in management, and I need a tablet that can be versatile for all practical uses: documents, pics, notes, email, music, internet, news. I like gadgets and do not have a bias to any specific brand. At home I have different brands, so I buy stuff based on their merits, and for this particular case, the Thrive satisfies all my requirements, and has indeed replaced my netbook. I recommend it fully to those with similar requirements and expectations.", "Date": "September 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "The Thrive is Awesome....BUT!", "Author": "BG", "ReviewID": "R2VUB5VS5C973P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I will first say I love the Thrive and though I never thought I would find a need for a tablet, I have been impressed. My main reason for choosing the Thrive was it's ability to expand the memory with the SD card slot and the USB connection. This feature alone makes the Thrive heads and tales above all others. I won't get into too much of the other nice features as there have been enough said in other reviews here that say it all and of which I agree with.This is what I was not aware of when I purchased the Thrive and I did not learn through the reviews I did read. First, iTunes will not work on the Thrive. It's Apple's way of trying shut out the product. So I need to convert all of my music and videos I have on iTunes if I want to use it on my Thrive. There is software out there in the $30 range that does this and I did get it, but so far it hasn't worked on my laptop. I heard good things about the software but right now I don't have a solution to converting all my iTunes material.The second is, I have not found a portable HD that will work with the Android OS. I purchased the Seagate GoFlex thin HD and it did not work. I contacted Seagate and they told me they don't sell an HD right not that is compatible to the Android OS. I also tried a Western Digital My Passport HD and it did not work. I'm waiting to hear from WD to see if they might have developed a driver so it will work with the Android OS. But the bottom line is, I have not found a portable HD that will work with the Thrive. I would hope a portable HD will be developed soon.The SD slot will take as much memory as you want. I purchased the Lexar Professional 128GB SDXC card and it works like a dream. This card is very pricey right now, but increased my memory 8 times more from the 16GB internal memory.I have tried several different sizes and makes of Thumb Drives and they all work, from a 4GB to a 32GB. So despite the fact a portable HD has not worked yet, the are still plenty of options to expand the memory with the Thrive that other tablets do not.Another surprise to me was how heavy the Thrive is. I don't consider it a negative, but it is the price you pay for having all the features the Thrive offers.The external speakers volume is louder than I was lead to believe in other reviews. The sound is stereo but it's not much better sound quality than the external speaker on the iTouch. With quality headsets, the sound is awesome. When watching a downloaded movie, the sound lets me really feel the movie and hear all the little background sounds. I was really amazed.I have just started to look at MS Office documents and so far they do open but it did not work too well with PowerPoint. It opened the document and I could see the text but not the pictures in the document. Also the document was not laid out as it should be, the text was scattered but readable. I don't know how else to explain it but I couldn't use it the way it was. Word was a little better but not by much. There is a learning curve getting use to the Android OS so it could be me not doing something right. I need to try this feature more to better understand it. On the other hand PDF files worked great.Overall I'm happy with the Thrive and look forward to increasing my uses for it as I get better at using it.", "Date": "August 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "An IPOD - IPHONE - IPAD replacement - forced to prove it", "Author": "Douglas Deltondo \"dougdelt\"", "ReviewID": "R1PL5O4LBEMRN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In Nov 2011, I bought my Toshiba Thrive with 32 gig space, for $370 plus at Best Buy. I had an IPOD Touch Gen 3, but I was on vacation, and wanted Netflix to interface with my hotel room's large screen. My IPOD does it feebly and not reliably. It uses component connections, and I prefer HDMI. I saw the Thrive had full HDMI, and that sealed it.I was being a bit extravagant. I began to find out I indeed liked this tablet for more than just Netflix. Then a crisis hit - I left my IPOD in a store waiting for my wife to try on clothes. My first thought was to just buy a new IPOD. But frankly that is $279--not cheap. And I began to wonder could I make this Thrive function at IPOD's exceptional levels. I now want to share with all IPOD, IPAD, IPHONE lovers that there is another quite exceptional way of operating without those toys and even still link up fully to them. And in many ways, I see Google has prepared a way to a better existence on Android devices than these.First, let me mention that I own a Google TV device. I started to see a similar App store on the Thrive. Netflix works the same. But then I saw apps not available on Google TV that made this device functional almost like a laptop in the same size and weight as the IPAD, but this has forward rear cameras to run Skype. (IPAD1 lacked this.) It has an SD slot like IPAD2. But I found something else that finally freed me from ITUNES -- I don't like ITUNE's policy that if you download on the IPOD music and lost it, then the music purchased is lost unless you synced it to your computer earlier. (My IPOD stopped syncing to the finish 1 month ago, so I have lost 4 downloaded songs due to this 'limitation.') But in the Android world, Google provides Google Music. It is now open to all. You can upload 20,000 songs. So far my Itunes is uploading a mere 3000 songs to Google Music. (You can download for offline listening if necessary.) And I can upload all my 3000 MP3s by simply telling Google where the directories are on my PC...I began that process, and it is still going on without a hitch. Now I can listen to all my music not only on the Thrive but on my Google TV, my PC, Mac, etc. And I conserve space by not having to use the SD card.Second, I like to transfer videos to my IPOD, but it restricted me to playing back only MP4s. I found in the Android world there is a free app MX Video Player that can, with a free codec, play MPEG video files -- my most common format on my PC. No more having to convert to MP4 first that my IPOD required. So my SD card on the Thrive serves as a store of my favorite videos.Third, I am an ebook buyer for almost all books now. I love Kindle books. I had that on my IPOD. I now have it on the Thrive, and it is far more readable. I also have my Barnes & Noble books -- which I formerly read always on my Nook. Now with Thrive, I wonder if I need the Nook. (If you want to save $100, the Nook is a quasi-tablet device now with many available and excellent apps. But it is far from a Thrive.) I also have my Google Books app on Thrive just as on the IPOD. But on the Thrive, I now also have ebooks from the Android community (I think Google books by another name) and an app called Book Place standard on the initial tablet. Book Place has lots of choices of free ebooks, and it appears more than just Google books. Thrive also is a great book reader -- easy on the eyes. I will keep my Nook because so far it appears that it keeps notes better. PS The Adobe Reader for Thrive, if you open an ebook in it remembers it, keeps a library of PDFS for you, and is the best reader of PDFs.Fourth, I found all my key IPOD apps in the Android store. I also found a few which exceed the IPOD. I have my broker's account apps, along with KITCO apps, Mint, etc. I have Loseit, my fav dieting app on the IPOD. I find the google docs app superior on Thrive -- it is one click to see all, instead of a sub page and 2 clicks to start a doc on my lost IPOD. I did lose my Naturally Speaking app on IPOD, but I found the voice translator built in Thrive is pretty amazing. Google Voice app works on Thrive while it was blocked on my IPOD. I liked Gmail on IPOD a bit better....but one feature on Thrive is better -- I can read the stored mail in folders which in IPOD's Gmail I could not figure a way to access. I could only read the Inbox on the IPOD. I have my google contacts and calendar again here on Thrive -- the apps are pre-installed. Also Thrive has a Picasa Photos app which is nice, which I did not have on IPOD. Dropbox works the same on Thrive. I found on the factory-Thrive a Logmein app was standard which I recollect was $$ as an IPOD app. More important, it works--great. Also, very important to me, I happily found my 1Password App (a paid product but operates on desktop simultaneously with IPOD, Thrive/Android, etc., and is vital nowadays--with flawless security.) There is also Pandora and I Tune Radio--free with full access to foreign programs, etc.Fifth, because there is a true File Manager standard with Thrive, you eventually get the feel that this is a mini laptop. You can find audio files, edit word processing and spreadsheet files if you get the Quickoffice or Office Suite Pro suite etc., You can then email them, or copy to SD card and get back to your desktop.So what started out as simply a vacation tablet to play our favorite Netflix programs turned into a forced discovery that this is one helluva replacement for my later lost IPOD. It is bigger but at 1.3 lbs, I found I got used to it. I plan on bringing it to the office, and use the $29 mini-docking stand for charging and to hold up the device so it is always visible like a TV. This way I will keep track of incoming email (also signaled by a gentle sound), my calendar, and I can play music or do pic slideshows. (It multitasks and can do both at the same time.)All in all, I am very satisfied with this device. Oh -- I forgot to mention it has a very innovative interface where you have 3 main panels to arrange apps -- much easier than IPOD...You press down on app image, and then only it becomes moveable, and then you drag to one of the 3 panels and you can easily place where you want. The background photo is more meaningful to make a wallpaper than on the IPOD because you can see it with the spread of the icons on the Thrive's apps. One thing you learn later is that all the apps you download are up in a link in the top right --all in alphabetical order. And in that \"App\"  area you can then press on one of their icons and drag down to one of the 3 panels I mentioned before. It still stays on that \"App\" area accessed through the top right link. When you want to clean up the 3 panels, you simply press on a specific icon, and then the \"App\" link turns into \"Remove.\" You drag the unwanted app there. But it is not entirely gone. You can get it back from the \"App\" area linked through the icon in the top right. This has proven useful. If for space reasons, you want to uninstall an app, that is done by going to the App area via the link in the top right, finding the unwanted app, and this time, highlighting an app toggles to an uninstall icon in the top right. Drag and drop there, and voila, it is gone.I cannot say anyone should not buy an IPAD2 since I never tried it, but (a) this is cheaper; (b) opens to Google's vision which is catching up and may one day leapfrog over the Apple approach, with more open software architecture; and (c) does everything my IPOD did (which is like an IPAD), and (d) has a few tricks lacking in my IPOD (and I suppose in the IPAD2.) I will stop there.... A solid choice. Hope this helps someone in similar circumstances wondering how this compares to an IPOD / IPAD.UPDATE 12-17-2011. I use this at work to keep track of Yahoo email and Gmail. There is an app for Yahoo. I keep the Thrive in a power stand ($25 accessory), and I get beeped whenever mail shows up and then just scroll like on a 2d screen my email. I also found Google Music, which is a game changer. You upload all your old MP3s and your entire Itunes Library (which it stays in sync with later, as you add more) -- 20,000 max songs (free), and you have your music with you wherever you have a wireless connection. No need to worry about if you need more than 8-30 gig this is sold with. (Google's angle? They want you to make them your new ITUNES for purchasing future music. I may just do that....They beat Apple to cloud based music. I also have an Amazon MP3 app to buy from there which is a 2d cloud storage primarily for purchases with it.) I like Thrive's standard \"Gallery\" app because it reads photos off the SD card, and then you hit Play and it does slideshow -- all while my Google Music is playing off Internet. Nice. Netflix works smooth and outputs to TV via HDMI. Amazing new app -- Google Currents -- let's you get free tons of magazines...I like investment stuff and science. There is Forbes, Alpha, Streetwise, and Scientific American. There is also PC Mag, Mac World, etc. I haven't see Google Currents on Ipod / Ipad, but Google supports app on Android Thribe that are free which makes this far more valuable than cost of device. Oh, and I run on Thrive Barnes & Noble Nook and Amazon Kindle app, and thus have the best of both those worlds, plus my Books.google purchases. The openness of this Android operating system, compared to my IPOD, in the end makes this the obvious long term winner. I did not think this would happen so soon, but I think Android has now caught Apple's apps, and is the process of far surpassing them.UPDATE 12-27-2011. I found by accident that Thrive has widgets that display in one 3x2 box my last 3 email, and another Google calendar widget which shows next 6 appointments. You access widgets at the bottom of the screen. You must press within one of the 5 panels, and then you see the widget options fill bottom half of the screen. In the widget options, you see the possible screen size of the 'window' into email / calendar that can be placed on one of the 5 Panels. Before selecting it, you must have enough room on that panel above to fit it. Then drag it up, and voila, you have a great widget. Another discovery: install Evernote app and Dolphin browser. When you like an article, and want it copied to Evernote, in Dolphin, press text on screen, select all, then press top button at right of browser, select \"share\" and select Evernote which then lets you pick what Evernote folder it goes to. Voila, you now have that article properly filed to be used everywhere else you run Evernote - IPOD, PC, Mac, etc. The Dolphin browser lets you save in area below address bar recurrent webpages...more intuitive to set up than competitors. And if you swipe left in Dolphin, you click the bookmark button on bottom to add a bookmark which then allows to place in categories. You have to stumble on that to figure out. But that makes it better book mark system than other browsers except Opera Mobile which is excellent for bookmarks too. Also recommend the Astro file manager app. Free. It lets you copy, move, etc. files, and see folder structure, PDFS, etc., open and organize. Also, Pogoplug app works for music, and download of videos you store there. Thus, gives you your own personal cloud. For NFL fans, the NFL 2011 app gives you vid highlights of all scoring plays in each game -- on game day. I never found anything like this on my IPOD. Several Freecell games are terrible. Finally found Softicks' Solitaires -  only is Freecell. Superior. Also, I hate the standard keyboard input until I purchased Flex9 Text Input. Has dictation option that actually works. I have now made this almost a complete laptop with lots more fun and constant accessibility.

If you don't wish to read on, I would summarize by saying that I love the flexible hardware, the size, and the quality of the Thrive.  It took over 10 hours of reading reviews and hard deliberation before I purchased my Thrive, and I've never reconsidered the decision.  At this point I'm thinking of purchasing another so I don't have to keep fighting my wife for use of the tablet.I work at a university, and I do a great deal of reading and note-taking with my tablet beyond the normal day-to-day activities of watching videos, playing games, and browsing the web.Hardware:I don't think there's anything that I would add to the built-in hardware specs.  The screen is bright and beautiful.  The touchscreen is snappy and responsive.  I also love having a 10.1' (diagonal) screen.  Play with some tablets before you buy--I find 7\" tablets to be appallingly small at this point.  The screen size and quality make it perfect for watching videos, playing games, or reading ebooks/pdfs.The tablet is a little thick compared to an iPad.  Think a thicker magazine rather than a thinner magazine (still roughly magazine sized, though).  I believe it's slightly heavier than some tablets.  Either way, I haven't had and issue.  When I'm reading, playing games, or watching videos I can hold the tablet for over an hour at a time with little fatigue.The removable backplate is rubberized so it doesn't slip on any surface, and when you pry it off you find a user-replacable battery (awesome!).  If you go on long flights or trips, you can easily have extras around for less than $30 a pop (Toshiba 6-Cell Replacement Li-Ion Battery Pack for 10\" Thrive Tablet (PA3884U-1BRR)).  If you're not into that, the battery that came with my tablet still holds at least a day's charge after months of heavy use.  You can also find replacement backplates in a number of different colors if you like to accessorize.I love having full HTMI and USB.  I've hooked the tablet up to my HDTV a number of times for playing games and watching videos.  The HTMI resolution doesn't go to a full 1080p, but the 780p resolution looks really good.  The front and back facing cameras are more than good enough for Skype or for putting things on craigslist.  I wouldn't use them for anything that I was planning on framing, but I've got better cameras when I want to take pictures.  (Ignore the megapixel rating, what you get appears to be significantly less due to relatively low quality optics.)If you want more memory for apps or data, the thrive is easily expandable via SD card.  However, I have barely begun to scratch the upper limit of the memory on mine.  That being said, I don't store a lot of songs or videos on the tablet.  I access most of my media remotely either via youtube or a cloud-based music provider.Software:The port of ICS is beautiful, and works extremely well.  I have no real complaints.  If you're used to Android you should feel right at home.  If you are new to Android (iPad?) you should be able to figure things out pretty quickly.  Ignoring some minor glitches the upgrade to ICS is great).  The pre-bundled apps are hit-or-miss.  Some I use almost daily, others I quickly found replacements for.  Either way theIf you want to upgrade with accessories:If you're looking to upgrade your hardware experience at all, I would recommend starting with the Logitech Tablet Keyboard for Android 3.0+ (920-003390).  You'll get a flip-out tablet stand and a bluetooth keyboard all in one package.  They keyboard works great for me with the old Honeycomb OS and with the new ICS upgrade.  If you want to use your tablet to take notes, I would suggest getting an AmazonBasics Stylus.  I take notes all the time at meetings and the combo works great.I love everything about my Thrive, and after several months of ownership I find new uses for mine every day.

It works perfectly and I am enjoying it on a daily basis.  I also have an Ipad (1) and have now relegated it to my wife for use on the sofa for quick Google lookups and Weather.com forecasts!  I also purchased both docking stations and a second power supply.  I use the basic base in my office with the Thrive mounted to it.  This keeps it fully charged and allows easy viewing of live TV and recorded TV programs.  The second power supply and advanced base is on my flat screen tv stand (behind the TV) where I keep the Thrive and use it to stream HD programs from my Windows Media Center pc.  This works great.  The HDMI output provides excellent quality.  I also have an  ASUS wireless laptop style RF keyboard connected via the docking stations usb connector and can use the keyboard/mouse functions from my viewing position. I also installed a 16 gb SD card and store my music files there.  While it is true that there are not as many apps for Android as for Ipad I have found that I have everything that really matters to me installed on the Thrive.  The Amazon App store and music store are great.In summary, this is a great tablet.  Nice screen, good bright colors, solid performance, no reboots or lockups at all.

I previously had my heart set on the Asus Transformer, because of the price compared to how many functions the device had. I weighed my options, pitting specs against one another and finally decided on the Asus. The day I was set to buy the Asus I saw a fellow classmate with a nice looking tablet. Naturally I asked her what the tablet was, and never hearing of it I went and researched this beautiful tablet. I will not bore you with all the specs as many other helpful people have already done so. But I will say what really sold me on this specific tablet was its ability to read a flash drive without an adapter of any kind, snd then there is the stunning screen that rivals the Galaxy Tab in my opinion.The few downsides I had experienced, is that this tablet was very obviously supposed to be held in portrait mode, and that sometimes interferes with things such as the camera.

Lots of other reviewers have given lots of reasons to love the Thrive and I won't rehash those. My primary reason for buying a Thrive involves my long term affliction. I am a bookworm. I owned a Nook but I also owned more than 50 Kindle books. What to do? I could lug around two e-readers or I could buy the Thrive and install Nook and Kindle for Android. And so I did. Now I have all 100+ e-books on one device. I read as much as I want. The Thrive battery lasts me about 8-9 hours without a recharge. For me, a contractor in Kabul, Afghanistan the convenience of having my book collection on a tablet is well worth the 500 plus dollars I spent.Other thoughts: Android is much preferred to Apple's iOS in my book, particularly after Apple forced Barnes & Noble to stop selling books from within the Nook app. I've watched a few movies on the Thrive as well and I'm impressed with the video and sound quality (make sure you use decent headphones and tweak the audio settings). The Toshiba app store and book store are of zero interest to me. Buy a couple of microfiber cloths because you'll spend a lot of time wiping fingerprints off the glossy glass screen.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Tough Thrive lives up to its name!", "Author": "Leslye Sinn \"dragonmum\"", "ReviewID": "ROURXN25UF2OS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought my 8 GB Thrive to take with me on a trip to Europe. As a 51 yo early adaptor nerd-Mom, I'm rough on electronics. When I did my research, it was the one that stood out from the crowd. Being on the geeky side, I like flexibility in my electronics, so the Thrive's multiple input/export ports were very attractive. I only got the 8 GB because it will take up to 128 GB of external storage and then there's media storage in the cloud for my Amazon content. The price was right with a discount for joining Audible (that I was going to do anyway!). Well, this tablet has been everything I expected. The only thing I would change would be to make the screen less shiny; I clean fingerprints off regularly - but often it's my bad for my greasy fingers... I recently bought a stylus, but haven't tried it out yet.For 5 weeks, I hauled the Thrive through Italy & France in my leather purse; that's how I've been carrying it since getting back, too. Despite sharing space with coins, keys and other misc stuff, after almost 3 months, there's not a scratch on it & the touch screen still works perfectly. It's great for showing photos; almost everyone I've used it to share photos with has been very impressed - especially those poor iPad slaves with no flexibility! I love being able to put the SD card from my camera and a 16 GB flash drive in and just transfer photos right to the drive. I made a digital photo book on a smaller flash drive that I took on my trip to share with people I met in Europe. I like having my storage in external media; I don't worry about losing it if my tablet gets lost or stolen.In Italy, we were in the middle of a catastrophic flood event. My son's 3 yo Acer net book got fried from the rain leaking into his camera bag.  My tablet got partly wet in my purse, but was perfectly fine. The power supply did get wet and was out of service for a few days, but works fine now it's completely dried out. Luckily, my tablet was almost fully charged at the time. The battery life is awesome! I get at least 10 hours of active use; putting it in sleep mode uses about 1/3 of the battery over about 12 hours. Turning off the Wi-Fi, which uses energy scanning for connections, extends it even more. I just had to be careful to use it sparingly and turn off the Wi-Fi if I wasn't actively using it, so I only had a couple days without charge before the power supply was working again.  There was no problem using European current with just adapters. It really does charge to 100% in about an hour - extremely convenient.The speakers are very good. It makes a difference how the tablet is oriented, since they are on what I would consider the bottom side. We listened to several audio books & kept up with our favorite news programs (including the Daily Show) during our trip. Streaming video works well in the native browser; unfortunately, moble firefox doesn't support flash, so there's no ad-block function. The screen is large enough that it is comfortable for 2 people to watch together. There is a minimal drop in brightness when viewing at an angle. I used the camera a few times when my Nikon wasn't available; not great resolution, but is good for snapshots.  I used it in wi-fi hotspots to keep in touch with my family in US much more cheaply than paying for smartphone data.So far, the Thrive has taken everything I've thrown at it so far (including a couple really impressive drops on a hardwood floor) without a blink. Luckily, it has a nice size Android keypad and apps that emulate Microsoft Office, because it has been the stand-in for a computer since Best Buy spent almost 6 months attempting to fix my fancy Asus laptop properly (miserable fail=full refund, right before trip). Then my brand new Samsung series 7 died only a few days after I got back (original ootb software pkg was unstable) and will be going back to the big box store as soon as the early holiday frenzy has died down. So all I can say is I'm glad my tough little tablet is living up to its name and Thriving!", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best of the bunch", "Author": "Grits", "ReviewID": "R2V8I5CMJ7CUH9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I researched this purchase thoroughly, comparing it with all of the other tablets in the price range.  We wanted an Android tablet since we've got Android phones, so we decided against the iPad.  Compared to the Asus, Acer, and Samsung (what appeared to be the three best alternatives in that price range), this won on paper hands down.  It has more features than either of the above, and the satisfaction ratings seemed very high with others.  With a considerably lower price at the time we purchased it (a GREAT sale price for the 32 GB model), I called a major electronics retail chain noted for good customer service (not \"WorstBuy\"), where we had recently purchased a Toshiba laptop for my wife.  The representative there was very knowledgeable about all of the tablets.  I asked her what was it that I wasn't seeing that justified almost a $100 \"premium\" over the Galaxy at the time (remember - the Thrive was on a great sale), especially when the Thrive seemed to have even more features than the Galaxy (which was my 2nd choice).  Her answer, with a distinct \"smile\" in her voice was, \"None, really.  Some people don't like the display quite as much as the Samsung, but that's about it.\"  The unspoken translation was clearly, \"Well, if you want to pay almost $100 more this weekend, get the Samsung - but you won't get more than if you get the Trive.\"  Given the high ratings for the Toshiba Thrive, and the fact that I didn't see a lot of negative ratings based on the display quality, I figured the display couldn't be particularly bad, so I went ahead and took advantage of a local sale that was as low as I could get on line that weekend or 100 miles away at the major electronics retailer I called.I could not be more pleased.  Connecting with our WiFi at home was simple and fast.  Despite no detailed instruction manual (as with everything else these days - Toshiba's is a .pdf), it was pretty intuitive once I figured out how to actually open it up once it had booted.  With just a few references to the electronic user's manual, I was up and running.  I've downloaded many apps, and particularly love that I am now automatically in sync between my phone's calendar, the calendar on Thrive, and the calendar in Thunderbird (my email program on my PC).  Regardless of which calendar I modify, the other two are updated usually within a minute (at least if the Thrive is within WiFi range).  I've seen it happe within just a few seconds.  This is all available by simply using Google Calendar (which can also be looked at on line, so there are really four different copies of the calendar available: phone, Thrive, email (Thunderbird), and on line through a computer (internet).Speed is quite acceptable (though I don't have experience with the other two brands I seriously considered, so I don't know how it compares with them).  It CERTAINLY beats the HP netbook that turned out to be a waste of money (not to mention their customer non-service, as opposed to Toshiba's that was outstanding on the one occasion we had to call about my wife's laptop).Oh - and the display qualities?  I could not be happier.  I have no idea what others might have complained about that the electronics store rep referred to, but I certainly don't have any complaints.  I've owned many PCs, built one, repaired many, so I've had plenty of experience and comparison opportunity - this device is just fine.Though I have not purchased or used it, the availability of a separate full size BlueTooth keyboard is intriguing.  However, the on-screen keyboard is close to full size, and very responsive - almost TOO responsive at times (a few double characters every now and then, particularly as I was getting used to it).Be SURE to get a full Documents-to-Go or similar program so you can use, create, and modify Micro$oft Office documents (including Powerpoint) - it's well worth the minimal cost for that app.  Another available option is a reader (only) for OpenOffice - but I'm not all that impressed with it, and you can't create anything with the app - it really needs some work by the developer.  Still, it is worth every penny (it's free).  <grin>For those that might want it for this purpose, I downloaded an app containing the scriptures and a hymn book.  Searching sure beats paging through the scriptures in classes or worship services (even with thumb tabs in the pages), and also having the built-in hymn book makes for very light packing/carrying for church.  Now it won't matter that all the hymn books always seem to bea on somebody else's row. ;-)  The zoom is particularly nice with both the hymn book and scripture apps so you can share with someone next to you (my wife, in our case).  Again, not everyone will use it for that, but it's just another example of one of the many things that can be done with a tablet.I wasn't sure I'd really like a tablet once I got it, but it's turned out to be very useful.  About the only thing I'm not all that impressed with is the 5 megapixel camera (it's got a lower quality one on the other side).  It's not bad, but my 6 megapixel older SLR camera is light years better than this one.  No, I didn't expect to have a near-equivalent, but I'm disappointed with the graininess of what's supposed to be a 5 megapixel image (admittedly, I'm a bit of a purist when it comes to photographic quality, so I don't think it would be fair for me to downgrade to a 4-star overall rating).Oh - battery life appears to be every bit of what Toshiba advertises.  While I haven't specifically timed it, the battery life is outstanding, both in use as well as in standby mode.  Many are reporting 8-9 hours of use (not just standby), and I have little doubt mine will get the same thing if I ever time it while it's new (yes, batteries do drop off over time).  Speaking of which, the Thrive has a user-replaceable battery, as opposed to having to send the whole unit back to Toshiba and all the $$$ that would go with that exercise.  So if/when the battery dies, your only cost is a few seconds of battery change, and only the cost of the battery itself.  Try THAT with most of the other tablets!  With my actual usage, I've used it for a couple of hours, put it away but forgotten to turn it completely off, and come back to it a couple of days later, only to find it with plenty of remaining battery life.  Note that Toshiba says it will rapid charge in an hour or so to around 90% if I remember correctly.  But the last 10% takes about another hour.  Why?  If it went rapid-charge all the way to 100% there would be excessive heat build up (heat hurts battery longevity).  But with the apparent trickle charge from 90% to 100%, heat build up is quite a bit less, thereby preserving battery life much better.Finally, if you absolutely have to have the thinnest tablet out there, this is not the one to buy.  I opted for features and benefits over thickness - and I'm glad I did.  Yes, it's considerably thicker than an iPad, but I sure paid less, it's compatible with our Android phones, and personally I don't find the slightly extra thickness to be a significant issue.  If that's a problem, consider still counting this as a high 4-star review.We give very few 5-star ratings, as our ratings history will show.  We reserve those for the very best of the best - and this tablet seems to meet that criteria nicely.  I've had it for several months now, and could not be happier.", "Date": "November 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Crappy glass screen spontaneously cracks!", "Author": "B.

Nor have I dropped it or exposed it to an extreme environment such as freezing weather or in my car on a summer day) I spent 3 days attempting to talk to someone in Toshiba customer service/abuse. When I did finally talk to a representative I was rudely dismissed as a fool who did not know how to take care of her electronics. I have since done extensive research on Toshiba Thrives and found this is a very common complaint. The glass screen is known to spontaneously crack under ANY circumstance including holding it by the corners! Any reviewer that tried to get Toshiba's customer service to help tells the same stories about getting hung up on, trying to get a \"real\" person and the rude attitude. I was informed that ANY crack in the glass is the owner's fault and not covered under their 1 year warranty. The fix would be an out-of-warranty issue and for $25 (a special mailer they send) I could mail it back to them for analysis. The estimate for repair....hold on to your hat...somewhere between $160 and $400. Even the cheapest repair would be more than half the price of a new Thrive. I told the Customer Service manager that I believed this to be a manufacturer's defect.

I am constantly powering her down or removing the battery.- Not as many apps to choose to from as on my Droid phone.

I won't pretend to know a lot, but I will give a review on this tablet, based on my experience, as a normal everyday user.  If you're super technologically savvy, chances are you won't need to read this anyways!I love everything (ok, maybe 99%) about it, especially the USB.  I get dumbfounded sometimes by just how easy they make it for users like me.  Plug in your external drive, go to file manager, voila!  Or go to media player, and all your movies and music are there!  Unless you have a hdd with lots of stuff in it (like mine, I have 1 TB external hdd that is almost full, and it took a while to load at first, but after that you wouldn't have to wait anymore), but usually it loads quite fast.  It loads a flash drive quicker than my nifty 2 year-old self-built PC.  I honestly believe that if your tablet doesn't have USB, you really don't know what you're missing.  I don't have time to go home and load files onto my tablet ahead of time.  I want my files to be readily available to me.Inside:Touch screen is very smooth, not too dull or sensitive.  I can flip through menu options or type perfectly fine.  Android honeycomb lets my apps run pretty fast and smooth, I haven't run into any problems.  Five screens available for you to put your apps anywhere your heart desires.  Touch the screen (or a specific icon) for 1 full second and you can easily organize them.  There are some apps pre-loaded which are quite useful.  On top of the normal variety (Gmail, Gtalk, map, browser, youtube, camera, calender, Android Market, App Place (Toshiba I assume), Book Place, LogMeIn, etc.) I added some fun apps.  I would suggest using Market over App Place for now because there are more reviews and apps available to choose from.  You can also personalize your background with pre-loaded wallpapers or photos you have.  If you use your own photo, they will let you select the area to crop so the photo can fit nicely on the screen.  Since most devices on market now that run android os are pretty similar, and the fact that I am simply not an android genie, I won't go into anymore details about how android honeycomb runs.Outside:Power, volume, screen rotation lock (useful if you like to lay down sideways and read like me), and SD Card slot on the top.  I hate it when people complain about not being able to save apps on sd card.  It is like saving windows media or winamp on a flash drive while you use your PC.  Why would anyone want to do that...?  Back on topic!  Mini USB, HDMI, and Micro USB ports are the only ones protected by a cover.  If you ever break it, simply by a new back plate.  I bought one for 19.99 on amazon for fun as well.  There is a lock that can release the back cover.  Guys, please don't give Thrive a minus star rating just because the cover is tight.  It is NOT supposed to come out easily.  If it does, you'll see more 1-star rating about how Thrive \"is not so durable after all DO NOT BUY!!!!!\" and I hate to see that reviwer get bashed afterwards.Below that are headphone and power port.  Speakers can be found below, flanking the docking station connector in the middle.  Thrive has both front and back camera also, if you like to take photos of yourself.  Everything is pretty self explanatory.It's funny how whatever people seem to complain about Thrive, is what I love.  I love that it has certain thickness, or \"substance\" to it.  It feels durable.  The back cover is rubbery, so it doesn't get scratched as easily as regular plastic cover.  It is also replaceable, so I don't feel bad roughing it up.  It is heavier than most tablets on the market, but your arms weigh more than this really, and I think essentially it would be the weight of your arms wearing you down, not a tablet that weighs several ounces more than others.  If you don't like lifting objects at all then...why get a tablet...I can play with it all day (10+ hrs?) and it still has battery left.  When I first got it, I had to play a movie overnight just to drain the battery.  It recharges back to 100% after one hour or so, quite fast if you ask me.  When you're low on battery, it buzzes and let you know you're down to, say, 14%.  The right bottom corner tells you how much battery you have left, besides the time, and wireless/bluetooth connection icons.  If you're downloading something, the icons will be there as well.The one improvement I wish for is louder stereo speaker.  It's not very loud, but is it a deal breaker or star-rating wrecker?  Not at all for me.Overall, Thrive is a very solid piece of electronic.  It meets everything I want in a tablet: work and play whenever.  My argument for Thrive: it's one of the cheaper ones with a 10\" screen and NAME BRAND (I can foresee someone leaving a reply saying there are $100 ones), reliable, and the only tablet on market with USB, a pretty sensible move by Toshiba.  Honestly, USB port was a big selling point for me.  When I carry a flash drive or external hdd with me, that's the ultimate definition of easy accessibility.I've read many negative reviews on amazon and elsewhere.  If you know statistic, and you have a little bit of common sense (don't want to sound mean but, sorry), you know that nothing is absolutely 100% by probability.  I am well known by friends and family to be an electronic wrecker.  I break everything, from phones and ipod to washing machine and TV--3 days before Wold Cup all because of my \"magic touch\" and/or bad luck.

Meyertons \"Creative Mind\"", "ReviewID": "R3JW4B2BKX5Q2R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought a 16 GB iPad 2 in spring 2011. It's great for movies and games, but it's got some fatal flaws. For reading, it's too bright and awkward and slippery to hold. For typing, it's the old index finger tap dance unless you have the cover, which allows one to lay it at an angle on a flat surface. This matters because I am dependent on the cloud for access to most of my files. That little problem Apple has with Flash? That turns out to be a big problem for me - I can't access a LOT of content on it, which is frustrating. Oh, and the cover won't stay attached when I hold it, no matter how gently I grip it.So, I bought myself a 32 GB Toshiba Thrive - from Sears. Yes, Sears - before Amazon caught on to the Sears cheaper pricing and lowered its price. I got the 32 GB Thrive for $479, a colored back for $18.99, and 2 day shipping for under $6 - no expedited shipping, no Prime membership required. Not too shabby! I love Amazon, but I will check in with Sears more often in future.I'm adding a 64 GB SD card so I'll wind up with 100 GB Honeycomb 3.1 device for another $55. It's easier to hold thanks to the grippy back even though it's bigger, and it seems a tad sturdier too. I can connect it easily to all my other non-Apple devices with all the many lovely ports described in other reviews, and it is at least as snappy as the iPad. I have over a dozen full length movies on it with plenty of room for more, all easily loaded and managed with the handy file manager. Why doesn't Apple create a file manager for the iPad?Drawbacks: The Android tablet app market is not as fully developed as the iPad market is - yet. The screen is not as bright, which might bother some - but that actually turns out to be a plus for reading text as the glare is not as much of a problem. Still, I deducted a star for that. Other reviewers found the back difficult to remove, but I snapped it off first try with no trouble at all and snapped the new one on just as easily. I LOVE that the battery is replaceable - I can expect to use this tablet for years to come.Update: 3 months later, I find I love the Thrive. I've had no problems with it, and I've stored nearly 20 full length movies on the SD card. Now I'm listening to Audible books and Google and Amazon music via the cloud. I use Twitter and email on it daily, and it is the only device I own that fully integrates my calendars in an intuitive, clean interface. It's become my go-to device for everything except long written pieces. Meantime, my iPad2 barely gets used. I do love the ebook \"Our Choice\" on the iPad2, but ebook maker Push Pop was purchased by Facebook and killed off, so I wouldn't expect more of the same anytime soon. The price of the Thrive has dropped slightly too, so that's cool.Update: 1 year later - I got a skin for my iPad which helps with the grip problem, but makes it even heavier. I love iPad for games, but I have maxed out the 16 GB and now have to be very careful what I keep and what I delete on it. As a result, the fact that I can only sync it to one laptop makes it a pain! I'm thrilled with iBook Author on my Lion laptop, but Apple's walled garden means if I write a book, it's only available to iTunes users. That's ugly, so I'm looking at other, more universal ebook tools. I'm still adding stuff as I like to the Thrive and have plenty of memory left - that expandable memory turns out to matter a lot; plus whenever I buy and Android app it's available for both of my Android devices, unlike Apple apps. Once in a while, I like to connect my Thrive to my HD TV, which is so easy with the HDMI port. I looked at xcode and it looks pretty daunting, so now I'm looking at the MIT App Inventor. I actually successful got the simple \"hello world\" app to work in just a short time, so I'm hopeful I can do more there. The openness of the Android market is quite appealing for those of us who want to be able to create, not just consume. Both devices seem to have plenty of battery life, but I would say iPad is better here.

The unit was only 33days old so it was just outside the Amazon return policy of 30days. Toshiba charged me $24.95 to return the unit for repair. The support staff don't seem to be up to speed on Tablets as yet. All of them kept refering to my product as a \"laptop\" I kept correcting them but since they were reading from a troubleshooting script they continued to say \"laptop\". The support I was given was basically, 1.pull the battery out, put it back in and turn it on. 2. send it in for repair.

I wanted a tablet that I could use as an expansion to my desktop. My goals were: lots of storage space (so I could keep a complete copy of ALL of my mp3s and photos).  Power and speed - so I can do work through the web when needed.  Durability.  And of course, price.  I did not want a toy or something to make me look \"cool\".  I wanted something useful and functional.So I looked at some of my options.  The Fire... 8gb, with no expansion? *boggle* I can't even imagine who that would be useful for. Obviously a lot of people considering the hype, but certainly not me.The Galaxy.  As a mother of a 3 year old, I think the Galaxy would break just by my son looking at it.  The thing is like 1 mm thick! I'm not actually going to test it by having my son jump on the galaxy vs the thrive, but the thrive sure seems a heck of a lot more sturdy.The ipad. Just not in my price range right now.Asus transformer.  This looks like an interesting choice, but I don't know why, it just didn't do anything for me when I tried it out.  Without the keyboard, it really doesn't have anything to make it \"special\", and once you add in the keyboard, the price is getting pretty high up there.So then I looked at the Thrive.  It has sd, usb, and HDMI.  So a HUGE amount of storage potential.  Replaceable battery. Awesome.  Thick and heavy? Great, my 3 year old can actually use it without me having a panic attack. Battery life is not very long, but long enough for my needs.  I can plug a regular usb keyboard into it, making it like the transformer without the cost of a special keyboard.  So I bit the bullet and got it.  I've had it a couple of weeks so far.  Overall, I'm *very* pleased.  It does exactly what I want it to, and I would buy it again in a heartbeat.However, it does have some cons, and you should consider these before making a purchase:Is it thick and heavy? Yes. Yes it is.  I actually LIKE that, because it feels more sturdy to me.  However, I can also see this would depend largely on how you plan to use it.  Are you going to be walking around holding it in one hand?  If that's the case, then this tablet is probably a poor choice.  I have mine in a case and generally use it in my lap (with it resting on my legs and the case holding it up) or on a desk/table (again with the case holding it up).  It's perfectly fine in those circumstances.  I would recommend getting a case for it.The battery life seems very good. I do not have the screen turned all the way up. I turned it up to test it and it looked fantastic. However, set at auto it looks pretty good too and I'd rather have more battery life.The media player that comes with it by default is the suck.  It does not continue playing songs when the device goes to sleep. However, I downloaded a free media player app and that worked just fine. The audio is NOT very loud with earphones.  It has always been loud enough for me, but I work in a relatively quiet office.My biggest problem by far is that my laptop does not detect it through usb.  I have tried it on other computers and it works fine, but my laptop does not seem to have the right driver, and Toshiba does not have a place on their website where you can download the driver. I haven't been annoyed enough yet to contact support. Since my laptop is the only problem, I'll probably just work around it.The other two dumb design elements are the placement of things. Why on earth would you put the volume control RIGHT next to the power button? ugh. Also, I was trying to take a video of my son playing at the park and I felt like an idiot trying to hold it up with the case on. With the sun glare, I couldn't see the screen at all, and the camera location is very awkward with the case on (and not great even with the case off).I give this 5 stars because my only problems are minor and I love most things about it.  I have pointed out the negative points so you as a consumer can make an informed decision.  I really hope tablet designers continue to make some options for those of us that care about function and expansion possibilities.", "Date": "November 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent tablet", "Author": "T Chin", "ReviewID": "R2KO1WERN0KTC0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are looking for an iPad clone, this really isn't the best choice.  It seems to be better geared toward business users.  The unit is a little on the bulky size, but it is very much justified, due to its features.  The full sized (ie. normal) USB port, HDMI port and SD chip slot make the Toshiba Thrive very useful for those that need to have greater access to personally generated content, without needing a web connection.  Although the onboard WLAN appears to be pretty strong (as I was able to receive a signal from across a town square, when I was travelling in Europe recently), the Thrive's greatest strengths are its ports, which allowed me to connect thumb drives, USB hard drives, a USB hub, and many other devices, without difficulty.  The Thrive has excellent connectivity and for the most part, works with most Android software.  The only major siftware I have had to pay for was QuickOffice's Pro Edition, so I could edit MS Office documents on the road.  As a matter of functionality, even when using the on-screen keyboard, the interface is very smooth, responsive and accurate, without any of the annoying suggestive spelling issues that pop-up with Apple products.The battery life is much harder to figure out.  When playing video, the tablet has lasted through 10 hour flights, and depending on what software is open (and whether the WLAN is switch on or not), the standby time lasts anywhere from 3-4 days.  The Thrive has a very fast charging speed (less than 90 min, and appears to charge up to 80% in the first 45 minutes), which makes up for a lot of the power related issues.The video playback is very sharp, even when using movies that were previously sized for my iPod Touch and moving to a larger screen.  Playback is smooth and generally in sync.  The audio is fine, still better with headphones, but the onboard speakers are surprisingly loud.The camera takes nice photos, but is a little oddly placed.  Not a big deal.  .  .If you can live with the slightly thicker unit, its very competitively priced and a well performing unit.  If you are a person that creates or edits content, this is the unit for you.  .  .  If you are a content consumer, then the Samsung Galaxy tabler or the iPad may be a better option.

Frankly, I never understood any of it.  My interest in this particular Tablet came about when I was shopping, I noticed this tablet was on a one day sale. When I saw over 1000 purchased within 2 hours from the start of the sale, I wanted to know more about this product.  The price was right and I had the extra cash on hand. ( I'm on a fixed income)As I Googled Toshiba Thrive I learned more about this product and I compared them to other tablets, with 4 1/2 stars out of 5 I was sold. I have always owned a desktop computer, I found similarities in operation, of the Toshiba Thrive tablet to work almost in the same way.  The ports were very familiar to me as I noticed some of the same connections on my desk top were on the Toshiba Tablet.When I turned the tablet on, first thing I noticed was CARD GAMES...I am known as the CARD SHARk in our Senior Citizen Community..nobody wants to play poker, hearts, bridge or a honest game of Binocle-(also known as PINOCHLE)because I win all the time. When I saw the card game icon I knew I made the right decision to buy this tablet.I had no problem navagating through my first game, I had to change the rules to make it harder for me to keep winning. I found out after a week, I can play on line.  I now had to get this Tablet connected to WiFi.....I never had anything on WiFi....so now I learned about Wifi..now I am on line kicking Butt in various card games.I made some new friends on line, most had Facebook, twitter and other social media accounts...I was never interested in any of this, now I have a Facebook, twitter and I am learning about youtube.I have learned about APPS.  oh my god, so many to choose from.  The tablet comes pre-loaded, most I use.  I bought the 8GB Toshiba Thrive, the space I use on the tablet is only for the APPS.  The SD card I bought is 32GB storage space.  I store my PDF books...I download my books from a Torrent website..I am now reading 50 shades of Gray...(some men like reading that too)I found a movie converter that works for the Toshiba Thrive, so I have movies stored on the SD card.  I love classical Music so I have music on the storage as well.I have iHeart APP. so I can listen to newstalk radio...(this APP is free) for android devices.  PDF ..Adobe Reader APP is also free to download on to the tablet so you can read books in PDF format.ONE IMPORTANT THING..WITH THE TOSHIBA TABLET...OPEN an Account with GOOGLE, I now have a Gmail account...this opens a lot of doors and access to a lot of features for the Toshiba Thrive.I have learned so much in my old age, I credit the Toshiba Thrive.  The other Seniors love the music, one lady always tells me to play the jukebox....LoL....There is so much more for me to learn about this Tablet, I have a new found interest and happiness in my life especially at my age, I thought this would never happen.There are other accessories that go with this tablet, I have bought a Dock for the tablet, and a cover, and keyboard.  I don't use my desktop as much as I use to. I am now using that for down loading my books and music for my SD storage.I have some movies I hook our community TV to my Toshiba Thrive, with the HDMI cord. We watched Gone with the Wind..and now,  From here to Eternity, since Enest Borgnine just passed.  Our senior community is so happy.  The Director is thinking of letting our Events Coordinator Go, because the Toshiba Thrive has taken over our Senior Community. LOL...lol...I love I can carry this tablet everywhere. I can't believe the ease in operation, and how it's organized to think like people, meaning everything you need to make life easier is now at your finger tips.  I do my on line banking on the tablet, I email, tweet, and keep in contact with me card buddies through Facebook.I use the calendar, and alarm clock to know when it's time for my medications....The Toshiba Thrive Tablet has brought life back to me.I love it, now I am a fan to the SMART era thanks to the Toshiba Thrive, I will stick with this product, and I will look for other products from now on that has to do with Toshiba.I am so happy with Toshiba..I will look for Toshiba products first before I buy another name brand.", "Date": "July 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Toshiba Thrive; Multimedia Capabilities", "Author": "MP", "ReviewID": "R17CE50JVNSYNV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Since the first tablets came out three years ago, have not been a fan on typing in the same surface where the screen is (like the HPs Touch Screens) as your arms and fingers get tired, so had not been too interested in one.  Nevertheless, as I have been following up the tablets and due to a sale on the Internet, ordered a Refurbished Thrive for a very inexpensive price.  It is a 32 GB model with the Tegra Dual Processor and all the thrills characteristic of the Toshiba brand.The Thrive is not the Tablet that Anne Hathaway will bring to the Manhattan office (if The Devil Wears Prada was filmed in 2012) but it's more a tablet that would be used in Iron Man or The Transformers.  It is heavier and bulkier than the Samsung Galaxys and the Ipads (due to the expansion capabilities) and replaceable back cover.  But it looks Avatar alike.The main reason I selected a Thrive vs the well rated Motorola and Asus counterparts was the expansion capacities.  These Thrive Tablets have things used commonly with other electronic devices; USB, Mini-USB, SD, HDMI, replaceable battery and a regular jack for charging, unlike the Ipads which use \"proprietary everything\" and accept nothing.  Even though I have had this device for a week only, have found some surprising positive features and decided to write this preliminary review.Have been running some tests and here are the initial results.  Battery life with Google Maps, the GPS on and some movie playing is from six to seven hours.  Recharge time is two hours with the factory charger.  The Wi-Fi connects immediately to the Router I use and the Honeycomb (3.2) Android system which is very simple to use as have had a Droid phone for over a year.  The Android Marketplace has now been replaced by Google Plus and the software provided by Toshiba has been surprisingly good.All the applications downloaded work on the Thrive although some (used on the phones) vary considerably when used in these larger devices.  Many of these are similar or identical to their counterparts in the OS Systems but limitations exist.  As of now, the most surprising thing has been the Toshiba Multimedia Player.  There has not been the need to install supplemental VLC or Real Players as the Toshiba does everything in an unanticipated way.Unlike other devices such as the Apple products, the Toshiba Player does play videos in multiple formats, including the classic Audio Video Interleave; AVI that dates from the beginnings of Windows in the early nineties.  This video format allows you to record and watch movies up to an extremely small compression factor and the Thrive plays them like the Creative Zens do, perfectly.The Zens were manufactured by Creative Labs from 2005 to 2007 and unlike the Zune and Ipods, they play every format you may want to record.  AVIs take grossly one fifth the space comparable to other formats.  Thus in a 32 GBs SD card you can store five times the number of movies you may store in an Ipod or Zune.  You will not have aspect / ratio issues as the Toshiba systems compensates for that as does in the Zens.The Thrives audio consists of two mini speakers on the bottom (if placed horizontally/landscape) which have a half an inch aperture on each side.  They can be loud but cannot reproduce the usual low frequencies from regular sized speakers.  But as there is a Bluetooth in these tablets, an external auxiliary larger speaker might help with the lack of bass.Internet capabilities are the typical Google ones; just start typing and you will get it.  MS-Word is being replaced by Google Docs but free software of \"Documents to Go\" allows you to access al Office features as long as they have been saved in the system.  Skype works perfectly but the tablet cameras are not the best.So far I am satisfied with my new toy and continue experimenting with video compression to evaluate how much can I load into a 32 or 64 GB card.  But, thinking of overriding the Honeycomb System and installing the Ice Cream one in the next month or so.  Let's see how it goes; more to come.

I wasn't even sure I would like a 10\" tablet and to be honest, I didn't really need one.  I have had the Kindle Fire since the initial release date and I really enjoy it but it only left me wanting more. I did go to the big box stores and compared \"hands on\" the different tablets: strengths, weaknesses and weights, the amount of accessories that each tablet brand had available and of course the tablet specs themselves.  I kept coming back to the Toshiba Thrive every time.  I am not going into spec details as many other reviewers have done that and much better than I could but the fact that the Thrive had full size ports was defiantly the deciding factor in my case. Well I finally bit the bullet and bought the 16gb Thrive on sale, haven't regretted it once.  I love it. Great apps available for it, no problem reading books, (Cool Reader app is great) have Dropbox (cloud storage) to retain books, movies, music without installing on the tablet and of course SD cards work the best for traveling.

For Apple haters, no amount of praise for iPad will convince them. Now, if you want a stylish, slim profile iPad alternative, stop right here as Thrive is all that iPad is not, some in a good way. Thrive is got to be the thickest tablet on the market by a mile but the thickness doesn't really detract from what it can do.  Compared to iPad:1) Screen:  Elongated compared to others but is bright with good resolution. Tie for now.(I hear Apple is scheming for a better screen on iPad3...)2) Operating System: If you have an Android smartphone, it will be familiar to you.  In terms of intuitiveness and ease of use, Apple wins here.3) Availability of Apps: Apple wins since they had a significant head start with over 100,00 apps but Android market is catching up.  I can pretty much find all the comparable apps I need in Android market.4) Design: Apple. Case in point, even minor thing like the charger design, Apple - elegant; Thrive - the thing is huge, like the brick that come with most laptops.5) Build quality: Apple by a slim margin (they're all made in China)6) Sound quality: Apple kicks everybody's butt here, including Thrive, although Thrive sounds better than other tablets.7) Flexibility/Expandibility: Thrive, hands down. Thrive has a SD card slot, full size HDMI port as well as mini and full size USB port for ultimate connectivity to computers, monitors and TVs.8) Camera: both have front and back cameras but execution and usability is better with Apple.9) Special mention: Thrive is only Tablet on the market with user replaceable batteries; it would definitely matter if you are going to keep this thing for more than 5 yrs. as most Lithium ion batteries peter out after about 5 yrs of use.  By then, all others including iPads will be expensive door stops. But then again, who keeps his/her smartphone more than 5 yrs? I guess that's the idea behind sealed batteries in these tablets, Toshiba excluded.Also, why doesn't other tablet makers come out more with 64GB drive units like iPads? I can see Apple charging what they charge as they are the market leader, but all other tablet makers including Toshiba seem to be stingy with internal memory.  8GB is ridiculous unless you are going to use it strictly as an e-reader. Sometimes you don't want streaming video; you want to download movies, pictures and videos to watch later. Even 16 and 32GB is not enough sometimes.

The main reasons for my decision were, Full Size USB/HDMI/Mini USB ports, big storage options, removable SD card, removable battery, excellent reputation of Toshiba.  As it turns out this tablet has pretty much made all my other laptops obsolete.  I use it all the time.  With the flexibility of having 32gb internal, full size SD card (I bought SDHC 32gb from Kingston but you might want to look into SDXC) or using an external hard drive or flash drive for storage this unit is easy to take with you anywhere.  In fact on my next trip I am going to leave my laptop at home.  One thing to know, your SD card and external drives must be formated exFAT or they won't work.  Took me some time to figure that out.Media files for the most part play with the installed software but of course you know that to play everything you will need to get others from the android and amazon markets.  MX Video Player seems to work the best with most files.The Thrive has a GPS chip inside and it works quite nicely with google navigation.  However since it doesn't have 3g capability you will not get traffic updates but it still works fine.Everyone always talks about the Galaxy tab as having a better display.  In my opinion, doesn't seem that much better to me and the port layout on the Thrive is definitely better.  You will appreciate that if you take a close look at the galaxy tab and compare it to the Thrive.Battery life seems just fine.  I really have no complaints because I don't notice a big drain unless I watch lots of video from my external USB disk drive.  For normal surfing, apps and games the battery lasts a long time.  I bought two chargers since an additional one was not too expensive.  I really like the rubber grip feel of the back cover too and it sits nicely on my Sole Treadmill.  So that means that the Thrive also will help you lose weight.

At first, I considered the iPad 2, but the lack of customization, and lack of on-board GPS (when there is no accompanying iPhone), kept me far away. I considered a BlackBerry Playbook, but found that its 7-inch screen was simply too small for my needs. I eventually found that the 10-inch Honeycomb-based tablets appealed the most to me, and the issue then became \"which one?\"I ended up opting for the Toshiba THRiVE, specifically the 32GB version, and am glad that I did. I bought it at the local BestBuy on 07/11/2011, which I understand was the day after its release. So, I have had it for about a week. Its same or slightly heavier weight, when compared to other tablets on the market, along with slightly greater thickness, are non issues for me. Sure, there is a difference, but not enough to become an issue on a practical level. The hardware, which includes the rich selection of useful ports, and some of the Toshiba-supplied apps, such as the File Manager, set this tablet apart from the others, at least when it came to my needs.Perhaps most importantly, if I had to make the decision again, I would go with the same: Toshiba THRiVE 32GB.", "Date": "July 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "I am very pleased!", "Author": "Michael A.

I am totally new to tablets and the android system having always been using your typical Windows pc.  I must say that I am getting used to Honeycomb OS.  Very simply, this tablet works for me. As for the issue of the sleep mode, it happened to me once AFTER I installed the wifi timeout app as many said that would help the problem.  Well only after I uninstalled that app did my tablet function normally AGAIN!  I also want to add that the suggestion of turning off wifi by selecting no wifi when screen is off AND turning off notifications by clicking on the time in the lower righthand corner then putting the tablet to sleep manually ,that is, do not wait for the timeout you have set, seems to work like a charm. Toshiba, I have read, knows about this issue and will address it in some kind of software update as it seems to have something to do with the new version of the Honeycomb OS. While I have also read that some people are quick to bash this tablet and bring/send it back for some other one, patience is needed as with the release of any new product.  The features and performance of the Thrive are excellent as far as I have had it for 5 days.

With innovative full-size USB and SD card slot built-in, the Thrive is a perfect platform to consume media on the go. But is it a good buy? Compare the Pros and Cons below, and judge for yourself..Pros1) ConnectivityMedia consumption and file transfers are easy and seamless thanks to the Thrive's built-in USB 2.0 and full size SD card slot. The USB 2.0 and SD card slot is what makes this tab stand out from the rest, for the time being. Tip: Connecting 2+ USB slots is possible if you purchase a Plugable USB 2.0 10 Port Hub (with Power Adapter).2) BuildThe tablet feels sturdy and non-slick in your hands. The grippy material on the battery bay underside leaves you more confident resting the tab on your lap. You know it probably won't accidentally slip and fall, and even if it did, the Thrive seems sturdy enough to best the occasional mishap. Toshiba's 1 year warranty (standard on the Thrive I ordered from Amazon) and firmware updates available after registering are also reassuring in this department.3) PerformanceIt's fast and easy to switch between apps, thanks to the Thrive's dual-core Nvidia Tegra 2 processor and Android Honeycomb's application switching menu. The application menu always remains minimized in the bottom left hand corner of your window, and displays a list of your most recently used apps. Thumb through them and switch back and forth, and the Tegra 2 doesn't mind a bit.4) Screen Size-10.1\" screen size makes browsing the web a more familiar and less eye-straining straining experience than on an Android phone.Cons1) Form FactorThe Thrive is bulky enough to wear down on you over time. As I typed on the tablet while resting it between my hands, a downward gravitational pull distracted me from what I was writing. Even with the Thumb Keyboard app installed, I still wasn't able to comfortably type and hold the tablet at the same time. No matter how I positioned the tablet or what changes I made to the keyboard layout, typing was still uncomfortable compared to typing on my Samsung Charge Android Froyo phone.2) FingerprintsThe screen attracts fingerprints easily. I'm sure the same could be said for most other devices out there but it's still a problem. It makes your space tab look all \"used\" by \"humans\" and whatnot. Hopefully this issue will improve as technology improves.ConclusionThe Thrive is a solid option for those seeking an ultraportable web-browsing and entertainment device. The Thrive's form factor is on the bulky side, but it's probably nothing you can't handle. Certainly the device would be at home in a dock, the Toshiba Thrive Multi-Dock with HDMI for 10.1-Inch Tablet (PA3934U-1PRP) for instance.At $480 for the 16GB version, the Thrive isn't cheap. The USB 2.0 port and full size SD card slot are nice features to have, but only impressive relative to other tablet offerings for the present moment. But if you really want to own an Android tablet, right now, I would urge you to consider the Thrive.Final Things to Ponder-A new Acer Chromebook is $350, and almost as portable. It may be a better choice for people who don't need a touch/Android interface.-There are still some Flash issues on Android. Just because Android supports Flash, doesn't mean that Flash works perfectly on Android.-Android Apps SHOULD port from your phone to your tablet, at no additional cost. I've purchased multiple Apps from both the Android Market, and from Amazon's App Store, and I had no problems whatsoever getting all of my Apps to show up on the Thrive. I suspect it could be because I purchased all of my Market apps from the same gmail address.-Android tablet prices are bound to decrease, you can always wait. If you're not sure a tab is right for you, that's exactly what I'd do.-Amazon is an amazing company to order electronics from.

The iPad has its fans, and that's great. But it isn't for everyone. It certainly wasn't for me, though I considered it carefully before I reached that decision. The form factor was not conducive to what I needed it for: creating spreadsheets, mind maps, and Visio-style diagrams.However, the earlier Android tablets and the BlackBerry PlayBook also didn't do what I needed. Either the screens were too small, or the focus on cloud services diminished their functionality in my eyes. The Toshiba Thrive, however, meets my needs.I am not saying it is for everybody. It is heavy, particularly because it is thicker to accommodate the range of ports it offers and the replaceable battery. But it is comfortable for me, and I like something that feels like it won't crack at the slightest nudge. And the built-in ports means I don't have to carry tons of accessories. The all-in-one features and expandable memory are what I need.I knew right away that this was the tablet I wanted. I would have loved a tablet with a Windows-tablet optimized OS. But that isn't coming anytime soon. So this will do, and I am very happy with it. (I have to agree, however, with some of the criticisms regarding the positioning of the cameras. I find that I easily touch them with my fingers when holding the tablet. That is why I gave the Thrive four stars, instead of five.)I can't rely on cloud services. I use the subway to commute to and from work. (And it doesn't help that carriers are aggressively restricting data use.) Relying exclusively on cloud services is a liability for me. I like that I can use a SDHC or USB stick to copy files to and from my or another person's PC. I like that I can connect the tablet to an HDMI-capable television for presentations (at work, we don't use projectors much. We have LCD televisions with HDMI ports).I think potential buyers should take the time to test the devices in the market. Go to an Apple store and compare the iPad to Android tablets (available at most electronic retailers). Not every Android tablet is the same, either. Give them a test drive, and don't listen to the marketing hype. See what works for you. It is an investment, and should be considered very carefully.", "Date": "July 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best Bang for Your Buck, Tablet Newbie Very Happy (but I do tend to be Techie, even if Older;-)", "Author": "Cold In Seattle \"Penny Pinching\"", "ReviewID": "RQ9UBR1P3ZB9A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Edit to Add:Typing this extra from tablet while testing Dolphin HD browser.

PS' Adobe Reader rather shallow for Android.************************Let me start by saying I'm NEW to Tablets, Netbooks and Honeycomb.  I can't stand the scroll pad on my laptop, my arthritis KILLS me, so I purchased a USB mouse.  Rumors of an Amazon Tablet had me excited, folks kept bringing up \"Wait for ICS\", etc.  I've been saving for a tablet due to smaller size and portability for a long time.  At some point - the price point meets your expectations, and it is just time to buy.  At the minimum - my apartment is dark, and I can switch between the Kindle and the Tab for Reading, and not spend so much on batteries.  I can also play some games on the Tab - worth the extra bucks to compliment a plain Vanilla Kindle any day (I originally purchased the free 3g Kindle without Special Offers back in December 2010). My Tablet arrived from Amazon on Tuesday - July 12th.  Below are my experiences so far:Pros:1. System Settings to mess around with.  File Manager, App Manager and Storage are handy for deleting files and saving space. Just click by the Time on the bottom bar, and you can get to everything.  Sound and video settings can be set on the fly.2. Screen rather durable, may not need the Screen Protectors.  So far - haven't needed the extra SD card I ordered.  VERY responsive, fast rotation, beautiful graphics (tweak the factory settings for that), first time I've actually LIKED gaming since pre-2000, pinch and zoom very good.  No, I can't play Chessmaster on it (as far as I know) - but I have my Laptop for that.3. The case is PERFECT, just like my Kindle Case.  Since I'm in the middle of a move - no real square footage to sit it up for watching, but will in my new place. You might want to consider a USB Keyboard, especially one with an additional USB port.4. Register ONCE for Google, that's it.  Have your GMail - can sync all data and settings with Google (even some old Picassa pics from a blog I wasn't really interested in).  Don't know WHO I will be using for Cloud yet - Google or Amazon.5. Apps galore.  Haven't purchased DocsToGo yet, but will eventually.  Downloaded Opera, haven't had a chance to set it up (use Firefox on main computer, not so good on tablets).  Read reviews and PERMISSIONS BEFORE DOWNLOADING APPS!!  For instance, TapATalk is a no go.6. Kindle and Archive just perfect.  Yuck on Toshiba books.  If you're into ePub, I'm sure the Reader App of your choice will work also.7. Keyboard is perfect for me in Landscape mode.  No lag, in fact - so sensitive to touch, need to watch my typing.  Easy switch between Qwerty and Number/Symbols.8. Turn Wifi off WAY extends your battery life.  Overnight sleep, still have 74% battery.Cons:1. The Sleep Mode experience.  Apparently - a problem with many.  I just power off, then power on when it won't wake from sleep mode.  If it sleeps for just a little time, no problem.  Its when sleeping for an hour or more - then we have the reboot experience.  My guess? A problem with all the hardware configuration specific to Toshiba and Honeycomb conflicts.  I've had the same problems with laptop sleep and hibernation.  I also get around it by putting to sleep, wake up in locked mode, and put back to sleep in locked mode.2. The News App from Toshiba (Starting Place).  It hangs, can't exit.  Must kill the process.  Would have been nice to use - but so far, not so much.  Can't delete apps - even third party ones that are pre-loaded and will never be used (demo games, Kaspersky, etc.)3. Watch out for too much syncing, you may get downloads from years ago.  Turn GPS off (unless you need it at that point in time).4. Lack of a 3g/4g/etc slot.  I know this is the trend with new tablets, and carriers are taking advantage of it (either a monthly charge, or quite the premium).  I want to spend for 3g/4g on the go, when I need it.  The first to come up with a reasonable MiFi - you get my business.5. Sound: My Sony Walkman Cell Phone was getting better speaker quality (comparison of Bad Romance mp3).  One needs to tweak the SRS settings under Multimedia.  Select settings for each one, turn off default, and press okay.  Turn off Ambient Noise Reduction (or whatever), and the devices sound much closer together.  Sound via flash could be improved (believe they are using hardware acceleration, would need to check flash settings).  Headphones are fine, sound improves with the aforementioned tweaks.Bottom Line:  great compliment to Kindle - now, don't need so many apps (active content) on the Kindle,  Easy to use even if nube to whole experience (but it pays to spend some time in Thrive and Honeycomb forums, watch some Tablet reviews on You Tube).  Build of Tab is great, just a swipe of the glass, keep in Case - and you are good to go.  You can either get the two year Square Trade Accident warranty, or the one year Toshiba Accident Coverage.  Three years is WAY too much for Technology that will probably change in a year.  Will it be the new NetBook?  Competition and price wars are a GOOD THING!

They have released several patches and the latest one seems to fix the problem.  At least it is waking up just about every time, with only one \"fail to wake\" issue in the past week.  That could be one of the dozens of apps I have loaded just misbehaving.My guess is this problem has been fixed.  The good news is Toshiba was VERY responsive.  Their consumer support 800-line was pleasant but mostly useless.  The forums, however, turned out to be a great resource.  Toshiba is actually reading & responding to the forum posts and have taken an active role in working with people and keeping everyone informed about the issues.At this point I'm certain the problem is resolved.  If not I have full confidence Toshiba will address any remaining issues quickly & professionally.On the PLUS side, this thing is great.  I'm loving it more every day.  My wife and my 5 year-old son use this every day now as well.  It is probably the most used device in the house these days.  There are a ton of great new Android apps coming out every day, my newest favorite is the CNN News app.  It is designed specifically for the tablet and is a quality product.  My son loves Angry Birds, it is a much better experience on this platform over a phone and also a quality app.  Another HUGE plus... the ability to surf just about any site in mobile or standard mode.  MOST sites are WAAAAYYYY better in standard mode, and that is only possible because this device fully supports Flash and almost any other web design element.Very cool.  I'm keeping it and highly recommend it to anyone.  In fact we are probably going to order one for my Grandmother today.*** UPDATE ***Turns out there is a critical design flaw with the Thrive that Toshiba is fully aware of.  The Thrive will not wake up out of sleep mode for 80% of the devices on the market.  My particular unit would come out of sleep mode after a hard reboot (hold down power to power off/hold down power to power on) but eventually hung so badly we needed to do a factory restore with Toshiba Support which wipes everything off the system (apps loaded, passwords, accounts, and anything you've saved).Toshiba is \"fast tracking\" a firmware update but as of this writing it is not out yet (July 14th, 2011).*** Original Review ***I'm a tech geek and I like to play with the latest gadgets.  Both for my business (we write apps for phones, tablets, desktops and the web) and just as a personal hobby.  I regularly update my collection of electronic toys and am always looking for new ways to put them to use.  However I've been late to the table/pad party.  Not because I don't like the idea.  I LOVE my smartphones, having gotten in on the iPhone the first month it came out, upgraded to an Android phone after that.  The general concept is great and certainly has made my life easier.But for the tablets I always walk away wanting more than is offered. That was before Toshiba announced the Thrive.  As soon as it was available for pre-order I bought one at Amazon.  The primary reasons I waited were two-fold, the lack of Flash on the iPad series was a deal breaker there.  The lack of any viable input/output ports on the other devices, poor screen quality, or small screens stopped me from a lot of \"coulda been\" tablets.  The Toshiba promised speed, power, an nvidia chip set driving the video, normal USB ports, an HDMI out, and more.  It sounded perfect.Finally, after 2 months of waiting, the Toshiba Thrive arrived today.  Granted I haven't played with it for very long yet, but I already like a lot of things about it.What I Like:- I plugged in my keyboard and started typing my email responses.  No extra drivers or hacks.  Very cool.  The normal on-screen keyboard works great, but for extended work the keyboard is a HUGE advantage over other tablets.- I then plugged in a small USB hub I had from another project, it is a small 4-port vanilla hub half the size of the credit card.  I then connected my keyboard and mouse.  Now I have the equivalent of a pretty sweet notebook computer with a touch screen. Again no special drivers or other trickery required, I just unplugged the keyboard & mouse from my laptop and put them in the hub on the tablet and it worked immediately.- The screen resolution is great.  Better than I expected but it is not as vibrant as some other screens I have seen.  However 90% of the time I'll be using this in the house or the office and the brightness and contrast is plenty for indoor use and I'm guessing anything but bright outdoor use.- The Honeycomb OS with the Toshiba tweaks is pretty decent.  Not sure if I like it as much as the HTC layer on Android 2.X, but it is right up there with it.- Setup and configuration was quick & painless.  All of my account information, marketplace apps, and more were readily available.  Every marketplace app for my phone is download and runs.  Only one app (WeatherBug premium) is not quite refined for the tablet with some text display overlaps (odd given the extra screen real estate).- There are a number of decent accessories already on the market from Toshiba for docking stations, replaceable backplates, quick-swap batteries, and carrying cases.- Some of the built-in apps are fairly well done.  The news service is a decent app and things like GMail are way easier to use on the Thrive than my phone and the UI feels better than even that on my web browser on my desktop system.- Videos are decent, sound is OK.  Not great, but for something this small & lightweight you really can't expect too much in the way of sound quality with the built-in speakers.- Plays flash videos and other flash content just as I expect.  I've not yet found any broken sites.Things To Improve- It is a little heaver than I expected. It is FAR more convenient/portable than any laptop/notebook I've ever come across.  In fact it is way more powerful, compact, and lighter than most netbooks.  Guess the 10\" screen is a bit bigger and heavier than I've been used to with the 3.5\" (or so) HTC Incredible I've been using for months.  It is not so heavy that it is a burden, but after a 15 minutes of holding it in one hand while playing with the apps with the other hand I needed to rest it on my leg or on the chair arm.  Then again, I'd not hold a notebook up for 30 minutes while using it and this is NOT meant to replace a handheld phone but is a better replacement for a small notebook/netbook.- The screen is not a newer oleophobic(sp?) type that is on most newer phones and the iPad2.  That means it doesn't repel the oil from your hands as well so fingerprints are immediately noticeable.  Not a big deal overall, but for people that want the surface to be clean and shiny all the time you'll need a lens cloth with you at all times.  Which Toshiba does not provide; unusual for most higher end touch-screens these days.- The responsiveness of the power button could be refined.  When it goes to sleep you need to hold the power in for a second.  It doesn't always respond with a quick tap.  Hold it in too long and it powers the unit off.  Not a huge deal, but the timing definitely needs to be tweaked a bit.  Two people in the office have already had issues waking it up and someone already powered it off when it appeared to hang.SummaryOverall I'm glad I waited.  I've not even started to use the Thrive the way I expect, but just the cursory review leaves me happy I waited for this tablet over the others on the market.Also, as a testament to the better build quality of this unit it was already dropped face down on the floor, a thin carpet over concrete.  It made a face-down \"thud\" as it hit the floor and I cringed as soon as I saw it take the fall.  Luckily the protective plastic cover that it shipped with was still on the face. There was no damage whatsoever from a 30\" drop off the edge of a desk, so I've already \"battle-tested\" the unit for those who are curious about the ability for this thing to take a beating.Based on the initial 5 hours with the unit I am thinking this one is a keeper and is something I will be recommending to clients at and our CSL blog ([...]).

I thought I wanted an Apple Ipad when I started looking last fall, but I started with the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 16GB.  The Galaxy Tablet was great in size and performance, but I felt like it lacked some important enhancements, so this is what led to my Toshiba Thrive purchases.Check out this comparison on the units, Apple iPad / Toshiba ThriveBattery replacement cost:  $279.00 Service / $26.88 User replaceable battery(buy extras!)HDMI output:  Not Available / Standard HDMI  portSD card reader:  Not Available / Standard SD card portUSB port:  Not Available / Standard USB portOK, so clearly these features were important to me, but wouldn't anyone want to be able to transfer files via SD card, and USB?

The Thrive is the best of them all, hands down.I won't bore you with specs, but will point out a few things that I deem as important in comparison to others...Top Decision Maker (for me):Removable/replaceable battery (no one else offers user accessible battery), which makes this usable forever!  Other manufacturers (listening Apple and others?) don't make the battery accessible, which means once the battery no longer holds a charge (after 500-1000 charges), you are tethered to the power cord or buying a new tablet (or paying hundreds of dollars to replace a battery at the factory, and most manufacturer's warranty doesn't cover batteries).Pros:Well-built, quality tabletLonger, wider, thicker (which makes it easier to hold onto) than other 10.1\" tablets.2.0 front facing camera / 5.0 rear facing camera (better cameras than iPad or Acer, not just in MP, but also quality)Toshiba is fast on OS upgrades (Ice Cream Sandwich scheduled for deployment in early 2012), and will continue OS upgrades beyond warranty period! (verified by Toshiba support)Interchangeable colored  backs ($5-20), so you are not stuck with aftermarket junk to personalize your tablet or replace a scratched one - factory backs have good grip too!Screen is DURABLE and VERY RESPONSIVEHardware is top-of-the-line, and should hold up to many thousands of hours of use (years)Full size HDMI, USB, and SD card slot... no one else offers all three full-size ports (most manufacturers offer everything in MINI/MICRO, or only one full-size port)Built-in browser is Fire-Fox derrivative (awesome), and file manager is tops... better than many paid versions from the marketBattery life is exceptional... 8-10-hrs depending on use... even streaming video to my TV, it lasts for more than 8-hrs... under \"normal\" app/web use, I squeak nearly 11-hrs out of it before low battery warning pops up!Cons:A bit heavy for some people... not exactly comfortable for one-handed use in landscape orientation (but you get use to it)No flash on rear-facing camera, but then again, who uses a tablet as their primary camera?Power/Wi-Fi/charge LEDs on the front are a bit distracting, but no deal breaker in my bookMemory issues:Some people are complaining that Application memory is limited to 2.9GB... this is NOT true... Toshiba has allocated blocks in 3GB sections to keep the OS running smooth and fast... as you add Applications in excess of the primary 2.9GB, another allocation block will be given to App storage.  This is done (brilliantly might I add) because some people use the tablet to run Apps, some for picture, music, video, documents, etc.... by allocating \"blocks\" for storage (think HDD partitioning), you get space prioritized for what you \"want\".If you cannot decide between tablets, and like so many of us, don't want to be an i-person... give the Thrive a good look... Price is better than most out there (far cheaper than Zoom or Galaxy), quality is tops, service is excellent, and you won't be disappointed with the outstanding performance!UPDATE:After my wife's Arnova 10 G2 died (less than 90-days old), and the warranty replacement arrived with a cracked screen... she'd had enough... she went to the store where she purchased it and traded up to the 16GB Thrive (personally, I think she was just jealous of mine, lol).", "Date": "December 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love my Thrive!

The iPad to me, just felt like a nerd's answer to a real world challenge.While looking at alternatives I came across the Thrive. Add memory up to 128 gb sd card (I'm told), dump in music and pictures by just plugging in a usb cable, finding the tablet, open the window and drag your music and pictures onto it. Take that Steve.After a couple of hours of playing with the Thrive( without a manual) I had it 90 % figured out. So many cool ideas like all my book marks in a window on my primary screen. Web sites ? Just book mark and there they are.  Don't need that one any more ? Drag it to the trash can. Speed ? On decent WiFi this is mostly as fast as my HP laptop. The color resolution is great and initially it feels like the battery life is better than my iPad. It does recharge in a fraction of the iPad time. Like 90 minutes to full. I haven't really worked with the camera yet, but a couple of quick shots looked good and the zoom was awesome.The only criticism I have is of the speakers. They are so bad, but just plug in your ear phones and party on.Also, the battery is user swapable. I will probably pick up a cheap non OEM spare when available (not now) but the OEM is about $80. Call Apple and tell them you need a battery in your iPad. AHAHAHAHAHAHA !At this moment, the competition hasn't quite caught up with the Thrive's accessories so prices on screen protectors, cases, holders and chargers aren't rock bottom yet, but I expect they soon will be. They are still very reasonable, just not give away. You can change out the back cover to six different colors for $20 (each) if that's your thing.In total, I would grade the iPad a 3 star based on how it made my life more complicated, not less. If I could give the Thrive a 6 star, I would. Seriously, this might not be your dream tablet, but it's mine. Toshiba Rocks.

In summary of owning this thing for the last year and a half, I purchased it for the hardware, but was disappointed by the software. After a 100 dollar price drop within a few months, that did sting a bit. I had it for about a year of OTA software updates that fixed the SOD, and also found out that the audio aux quality was poor due to software, not hardware. In closing, I DO NOT recommend that if you decide to purchase this ill fated product that you upgrade to 4.0.4 or Android ICS through Toshiba's OTA. It will boost overall performance and fix the audio aux problem, however the wifi browsing speed has slowed to a crawl and the \"Sleep of Death\" has returned. Also with this update they \"lock the bootloader\" which means that once the warranty expires and Toshiba no longer supports it (like they really ever did during the warranty period), you will not be able to root the device to extend its use by flashing further updated OS. I never though I would root myself, but ever since I OTA the ICS, I regret my decision.*********************************************************************************************************************************************************ADDENDUM*** on 7/18/11Just like another positive poster did, I am going to have to add a \"CON\" that will make my star rating a \"3\" if you look this up on multiple forums, you will find that after a brief period of time in sleep mode, you will not be able to wake it up unless you do a hard reset. This is very annoying. I plan on keeping my tablet for the reasons listed below and with hopes that a firmware update will fix the problem, BUT I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE ELSE BUY THIS TABLET UNTIL THERE IS A GUARANTEE THAT THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN FIXED.***********************************************************************************************************************************************I began searching for a tablet because the use of PDA's has now become long gone to the world of smart phones and tablets. The primary use of this tablet was to act as a PDA and install Epocrates, Medscape, etc to assist with school and clinical rotations, and got allot more than I bargained for.I own a Ipod, and cannot stand the exclusivity of it where it only will play AAC file formats and can only use I tunes to transfer files. I also use an Ipad at work, and the back of it, as sturdy as the metal is, is very slippery without a skin on it and the touch is less responsive than I would like. Also another downfall of apple is that there is no option for expansion.I have had my thrive for a week now and I love it, the possibilities of it's use are endless.The \"wide screen\" display allows me to watch movies the way they are intended. Also, when you rotate it vertically, you can use your thumbs to type on the keyboard, which is not so easy on the \"square\" tablets.With the right apps, it will play any movie and music file formats. I decided to expand the storage with a 64GB SDXC card, to which I now have a decent amount of my favorite music and movies on the tablet with some room to spare.With the HDMI, Full SD, and bluetooth capabilities, I am able to connect a keyboard, mouse, and watch it all on my HDTV. As soon as I plugged in the mousefrom my desktop, a cursor appeared immediately .Data transfer is easy, and does not require an \"I tunes\" program. SD, thumb drives, and every one of my external hard drives are recognized (those who do not know how to format to exfat on windows 7 need not apply.)The rubberized backing is comfortable and negates the need for additional accessories.The Honeycomb operating system is fast, and I love the multiple \"desktops\" in which I can organize school apps on one, entertainment on another, weather and news.....etc.The Wifi receiver works well, for I still use a basic five year old Belkin wireless router and the web surfing speed does not suffer a bit.The only cons I have found so far is when attempting to remove the back cover to access the battery, I feel like I am going to break the connectors every time I do it, and have no intention of buying a spare battery to switch back and forth, unless the first one dies.I have nothing to report concerning the battery life at this point, because I have not used it outside the house yet and usually keep it plugged in to save the battery.Is this tablet heavier and thicker than the others, yes but that does not bother me. The extra ports that the other tablets lack is more than worth the extra bulk.

No complaints.I downloaded Adobe Reader for Android and now I can read pdf books  to my heart's content. I can zoom in and out even on color pictures, just like on my desktop computer.I downloaded wordplayer and now I can read .epub and .mobi books beautifully with full font and spacing control and apparently can link up with calibre library on my desktop. Can adjust brightness while reading books by swiping up and down. Couldn't be happier with the reading capabilities.2. I tried to connect to an external usb hard drive and was unable. I think it has to be reformatted to exFat which I haven't looked up yet. But: This Toshiba at105 supports sdhx natively, which means you can put a 128 gig sdxc card in the full-sized sd slot. By the way the max capacity for sdxc is 2 TB, although I don't think you can buy bigger than 128 gig right now.3. One star of for it being 1.5 lbs.

In March, Woot offered the refurbished 16gig model at a great price and I jumped at at.  I have been thrilled with my purchase.Pros:The screen is super responsive to touch and has a crystal clear display.It connects flawlessly to wifi, even faster than my laptop is able to connect to my network.Game apps look stunning and are so much more fun to play on a larger tablet. Where's My Water is far too entertaining to get anything else done.(OK, maybe that's a con)Netflix streams beautifully and looks amazing on the Thrive.Full sized HDMI port allows me to stream Amazon Prime videos and Netflix to any TV with an HDMI port. Great for hotels that have wifi capability and it saves you from having to buy an additional streaming device for a home TV in a bedroom or spare room.Full sized USB port means I can plug in a flash drive to easily transfer files in or out.  It can also be used to hook up a keyboard or a mouse.Web browser is fast, not as fast as my laptop, but it works very well. The 1GHz dual-core mobile processor doesn't make me sit around and wait for things to load.Bluetooth capability means no wires when using earphones if you choose not to use the internal speakers.  This is great when cleaning the kitchen and watching a show or listening to music.  The internal speakers have a hard time being heard over the clanking of dishes and running of water.A physical screen lock button allows me to quickly keep the screen from auto-rotating when I'm lying in bed watching a movie or reading a book.  It is nice not having to go through a bunch of settings screens to turn it on and off.The back cover removes easily and can be switched out for a different color if you are into personalizing your tech. It also has a rubbery textured grip that makes you feel secure holding it.The battery is user replaceable, which not only makes it cheaper when your battery eventually needs to be changed out, it means you can carry a spare with you effectively doubling your battery life when you are in a situation that keeps you away from a charger.Battery charges very quickly and seems to last a long time, I have a refurbished model which may or may not hold the charge as long as a new one. I sometimes leave the screen brightness on auto, which allows the internal sensor to detect ambient lighting and decided how bright the screen needs to be.  The screen can get get extremely bright in the sunlight, and although, like any LCD screen, it has glare issues, my kids were still able to see the screen clearly when using it on a very sunny day in the car.  Most of time I keep the screen brightness all the way down to save on battery and I can still see just fine.Expandable memory in the form of a full sized SD card slot means you can take along all your movies and songs without running out of space.GPS works very well with the Navigation app and if you download the voice synthesizer it will give you audible turn by turn directions.  If you just use it visually a 10 inch screen for GPS is much nicer then the little GPS devices normally bought for cars. (Yes, the GPS works even when you aren't in a wifi hotspot)Voice recognition software works really well even with my Jersey accent.  All I do is press the microphone button and say what I'm looking for and Goggle does the rest.  It also works well with a grocery list app I downloaded.  No more excuses for forgetting to buy bread.Toshiba's Media player means I can stream movies and music from any of the computers on my network.G-mail is fully integrated with this tablet and makes keeping up on your contacts and calendar a breeze. Spreadsheets and documents are easy to work with on the 10 inch screen.I've had the tablet for over a month now and I have to say it hardly ever leaves my side. I keep finding more and more uses for it.Cons:It is heavier and bigger than the other tablets on the market.  It is the price paid for full sized ports and a replaceable battery, and one that does't bother me at all, but it may be a deal breaker for some.The cameras are nothing to write home about. You have to hold the tablet very still to keep the picture from being blurry and the video capture can't handle really fast movement. I find the colors don't render properly.  I didn't buy it for its camera, so it doesn't really affect me, but keep it in mind. The video camera works well enough for Skype, but it certainly isn't HD quality.Although I found the back cover easy to remove, it does feel a little like you are breaking it when you do it and I have heard some complaints.  However, if you unlock the cover first, and then slowly move your nails around the edges it isn't hard to get off and it only takes 2 seconds to snap it back into place.This is a wifi only device, it does not have the ability to use 3G. That is fine by me as I usually have access to wifi either at home or through my ISP's hot spots that are all over the place. In addition, with the ability to play apps and watch tons of movies that I can save to the SD card, I have plenty to do when I'm not in a hot spot.The biggest draw back is that there is no way to directly save to the SD card.  The tablet comes with a a file manager that is easy to use and you can move your pictures over to the SD card after taking them, but you can't default to that drive.  You need to be sure that whatever size internal drive you buy is enough for your app needs.  I bought the 16 gig version since I got a great deal, but the 32GB version would have been nice.  Quite frankly we all download so many apps we never use again that with a little bit of housekeeping I doubt I will regret my 16GB purchase.Oh, and I almost forgot the other drawback.

On the trade show floor, I am able to use this for all of my on-the-fly presentation material and with the full-sized USB ports I am able to instantly give the material to anyone with a thumb drive on their keychain! Video playback is excellent and with the expandable memory slot, I am able to travel with a few 32Gb SD cards that hold hundreds of movies!!Another bonus is the ability to instantly swap out the battery -- and replacement batteries are now available for a much more affordable $20 or so (compared with the $60 to $80 when it was first released). So I keep a couple extra batteries in my bag and I am good for all-day use.Cons: Even though the ability to swap out the battery is a bonus, the battery life itself isn't really that great -- 5 hours at best. In addition, accessories such as cases are extremely limited. I think there's only a few styles available, let alone anything like a case-keyboard combo. And since this is not an old model (the new Toshiba is the Excite), new accessories won't be coming out.Overall, this is an excellent business tool and entertainment source. The iPad, by comparison, leaves a lot to be desired. The iPad has no expandable memory -- which is a major downfall -- and you have to use iTunes to manage any media.

While away on holidays (along with my wife's sister and her husband) we wanted to copy my wife's sister's pictures taken on a Sony digital camera. It was impossible to just connect the memory card because the Sony camera used MS2 and the thrive only supports SD, but I wasn't ready to give up and decided to take a long shot and connect the camera to the USB port using sony's cable and it worked. The Thrive recognized the memory card inside the camera and we were able to copy all of the photos. It was easier using our camera because our panasonic camera already uses SD cards, so it's pretty easy. It's also so nice being able to connect the tablet to the TV set using a normal HDMI cable and watching movies and tv shows straight from the tablet, or connecting a flash drive and playing the movies stored in it. The speakers found in the tablet are very good, though I'd like them to be louder. Definitely beats the other tablets because of the connectivity. For me, this was the reason why I chose it. I'm also thinking of buying the HDMI docking station so I don't even have to open the cover to access the HDMI port.

So this year, she got her revenge and gifted me with this tablet.Let me start with my sole complaint, that would be the speakers.  In a word, they really do not perform well.  The sound is tinny and thin, worse than a transistor radio.  I downloaded an app for an equalizer and that did not improve the sound all that much.  Listening on headphones is perfectly fine, however.  (Update January 5, 2012) Another user recommended the AYL mini speakerAYL (TM) Portable Mini Speaker System for PC / Phone / Tablet / Apple iPod Touch / iPhone 4 / iPad / MP3 Player (Black) which I just received and it does the trick, audio is 100% improved.  I also learned in reading various Thrive forums, you can also fiddle with the audio output using the mutimedia tab in settings (and not simply the volume control in settings).  That also improved the sound quality.  I'm 100% happy, no complaints.Now, what do I love.  Number 1 is not being tied to iTunes.  I've found plenty of apps in the android market to keep me entertained and functioning.  Not having to sync with iTunes is a real blessing to me.The browser is nice and the wifi set up was up and connected in seconds.  I was able to configure several email accounts without any problem.  The kindle app works beautifully and I'm set with reading material for some time.The battery charges quickly and seems to hold a decent charge.  I like the option of keeping a spare battery on hand.Netflix streams nicely, the video and screen clarity are fine. I will be using headphones, so the sound will be no problem.  Must be me, but I do not see an appreciable difference between the Thrive and the iPad. The iPad does have great speakers, though.The ability to expand the memory is great.  I also hooked up my digital camera and transferred images (large high quality) very quickly.I'm very happy with this tablet, it does everything  I want.

One of the key points I liked when I bought this was that I have the ability to replace the battery when I am out and about, but I have not had to rely on that as the battery has never really died before I made it home.The screen is very clear but as stated in other reviews it is very prone to finger prints as you are using it.  Depending on light level you will not generally notice them when you are viewing at it directly, but when you sit it at an angle, they sometimes stand out.  I did have a ghost armor screen protector installed on this however and that helps keep the fingerprints at bay. Touch wise the screen is very responsive.  I love the size of the screen as well and the resolution is perfect.I love the fact that this has a full size USB port.  I am constantly using this to cross load files from my computer to the Thrive and back as it is so much quicker than relying on the bluetooth transfer which is very slow.I use this sometimes tied to my LG Tone bluetooth headsets LG Tone (HBS-700) Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Headset - Retail Packaging - Black/Orange.  It ties in perfectly with them and they sound great.  These headsets allow you to control the music when you are using the stock Toshiba media player, although I will say that seems to be the only program I can control with these headsets when I am using them.  I have tried other music programs with the thrive and the headset will only control the stock program and I haven't had a chance to see if there is a setting that would change the program as the default. Distance wise, I can listen to music off of my Thrive using bluetooth from anywhere in my house (3 bedroom single level).Memory wise the only issue I would have with this is that when you run a program, it stays in memory until you shut the Thrive completely off.  By this I mean that if I start an app to play a movie, the app will remain running in the background using a bit of memory until you shut the Thrive off completely. This isn't necessarily bad if you are shutting down your Thive every night, but in my case, I usually prefer to keep it in sleep mode so that I can instantly get to whatever I need to do. I will say that I can generally go quite a few days without having to shut it down unless I come across a memory hogging app. A note of caution to those who use live wall papers, some will severely reduce you memory ability.  I came across one that so clogged up the active memory that I had to shut off the Thrive several times in one day just to get the memory to clear.I keep my Thrive in a Roo Case made for it rooCASE Executive Portfolio (Black) Leather Case Cover with Landscape / Portrait View for Toshiba Thrive 10.1-Inch Android Tablet.  It is a nice case and protects the Thrive well.  It is a little bulky compared to some but I preferred quality and protection as priorities.I wouldn't trade this tablet for any on the market.  I have a couple of friends that have the Ipad 2 and I am sometimes jealous of the fact that they are so thin but to me the full size ports make the Thrive so outstanding.  Not to mention when their battery dies, and they can't recharge it because they don't have their power cord, I just tell them it is too bad my spare battery won't work in theirs.  :)", "Date": "December 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Toshiba Thrive rocks.", "Author": "Jeremy K.", "ReviewID": "RS87FL07L961O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had my Toshiba Thrive for about two weeks now and I love it.

These tablets are very good for what they were made for. People need to realize this is a tablet not a computer. It wasn't meant to be used as a word processor or make spreadsheets as a computer can do. This is purely meant for entertainment purposes. The weight of this compared to other tablets is a bit heavier but only a few oz's. If that's really a complait, you might want to consider a gym membership as I think 1.66lbs is fairly light when holding an object even for an extended period of time. The android OS is pretty smooth, there are some quirks but thats to be expected in a newer OS. The 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwhich) update should address any quirks. Really the only one that stands out to me was the keyboard for swype lags a bit as you type or even swype. The stock one was just fine. The other problem was something my wife experienced with one of her websites she goes to, she wasn't able to utilize certain features on that site. It was like a popup menu you should be able to scroll through but yet it wouldn't allow her to scroll. We tried different browsers also. So I am putting blame on the website and not the OS. There haven't been too many issues with using apps not made for the tablet, but there are some which is to be expected. Using the thrive it is very responsive and overall great for what it's meant to do and I would recommend it for people who are looking for a nice entertainment device.

I just wish I had better battery life, but hey, not everything is perfect, right? If I had the money, I would purchse another one for my husband. IT's that good!", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Versatile Tablet", "Author": "Jay Yourch", "ReviewID": "R3TCE4RAKSVOED", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Toshiba made a choice to design this tablet with features that are common on laptops, but less common on tablets, notably a user replaceable battery, full-size SD card slot, full-size HDMI and USB 2.0 ports.  These design choices increase the tablet's thickness, which make it chunky when compared with Apple's iPad 2 and Samsung's Galaxy Tab, but also increase its versatility.  If an ultra-thin tablet is what you're looking for, look elsewhere, but if you're interested in inexpensively increasing your tablet's storage by using the full-sized SD card slot and making use of standard USB mice, keyboards, thumb drives, and external hard drives with your tablet, then the Thrive could be your best choice.  Another way in which the Thrive is more like a laptop is that it is charged using a 30W power brick.  One advantage is that the Thrive charges very quickly, about an hour from empty to full, much faster than most tablets.  Another advantage is that the power brick has a long cord, so you can charge your Thrive while using it up to 12 feet (3.5 m) away from an outlet.  The disadvantage is that you have to use the charger that comes with it, you can't recharge it from a computer's USB port or other USB charger.I purchased a 128 GB SDXC Card here at Amazon, which when combined with the Thrive's 32 GB internal storage gives me 160 GB (a little less after formatting) of storage for all of my apps, data, documents, music and movies, substantially more storage than even the most expensive iPad or Galaxy Tab, neither of which is upgrade-able.  I have also tried plugging in a 1 TB portable USB hard drive and a wireless USB keyboard and mouse combination and all of these work perfectly.  Note that the Thrive does not support NTFS formatted SD cards and hard drives, they must be formatted as FAT or exFAT, which is easily done using a Windows 7 PC or a Mac.  If you already have an NTFS formatted drive or SD card with files on it that you want to use with your Thrive, you will have copy the files to another device, reformat it, and then copy the files back, which can be inconvenient and time consuming.  If you buy a new drive or SD card to use with your Thrive, be sure to check the format first, and change it if needed, before copying files to it.  The HDMI port also works well, mirroring the Thrive's screen on an HDMI equipped television or monitor.  Mirroring has worked on all of the apps I've tried, including streaming video from Netflix, and using the stock browser to stream Amazon Video on Demand.Toshiba has pushed out several system updates since I bought the Thrive, most recently upgrading to Android Honeycomb 3.2.  All of these updates have been deployed smoothly with no issues to report.  No word yet on if and when Toshiba will make Android 4.0 (aka Ice Cream Sandwich) available on the Thrive, but hopefully they will release this update in a timely manner.  Toshiba includes several games and apps of limited value (at least to me) which can't be deleted from the tablet, although their shortcuts can be removed from the home screens.  Two apps that Toshiba provided are very useful, one is a file manager that allows you to browse and make changes to the Thrive's file system, and can be used within the Thrive's internal storage, an installed SD card, or any mounted USB storage device.  The other useful app is the Toshiba Media Player, which, as expected, can play videos, music, and photo slide shows, but it can also act as a DLNA player, which allows it to stream media from any DLNA server, such as a NAS or a Windows 7 PC.", "Date": "December 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "superior conectivity", "Author": "jack", "ReviewID": "R2GO1W4MC6PQZV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Everything simply works and it has more connectivity than any other tablet which comes in handy whenever you need to plug a usb on the go or dont feel like having to exclusively use wireless means to transport data.

The only flaw I've found is Toshiba has decided to bundle into their Android OS a preloaded anti-virus package, namely Kaspersky anti-virus. Once the trail is activated, you can't get rid of it. After the trail period is over you get this annoying message on boot about the license needing to be renewed. It sits in memory wasting space. You can't disable it.

I was initally going to get a Xoom, but the non-working SD card slot was a deal breaker for me, the Samsung Galaxy did not have any USB or SD so I chose the Thrive. I have had my Thrive for almost 2 weeks and it had pretty much lived up to my expectations. I have had no problems with using the USB port with flash drives, it was unable to see my external drive. The failure to come out of sleep has gotten a lot of complaints, but it is not a deal breaker for me. After reading the Toshiba forum, I downloaded Advanced Wi-Fi app, which prevents the Wi-Fi from shutting down in sleep mode. The theory is that if the tablet is downloading, updates, emails, etc, and the Wi-Fi shuts off in the middle of the download, it causes the issue with coming out of sleep mode. The Advance Wi-Fi app has worked so far, until Toshiba comes out with a fix.Aside from that, the Thrive has been everything I wanted in a tablet. I can remotely log into my work computer through LogMeIn and Splashtop, no problems connecting my work email, it picked up my wireless printer, although I haven't tried to print yet.

I have to admit that I was sold on several aspects of the Thrive, that as of today are not unique to this tablet. To be upfront right in the beginning there are a few other Android tablets out now that compare quite competitively with the Thrive and offer some of the same features that makes the Thrive desirable. I have had my Thrive for about a week.Why should you consider the Thrive?-The price is cheaper than most Android tablets on the market now. Cheap enough that the Xoom has recently reduced in price by $100 to compete.-The Thrive is not tied to a carrier. Note that neither are the Asus and Acer tablets.-This tablet has ports. Full sized HDMI, USB 2.0, mini USB, and SD card, and of course headphone. It also has a port for Toshiba's docking stations which can be found by searching here on Amazon.-Some might not like that Toshiba has taken a different approach to aesthetics, pulling away from the apple look but some will. The back cover on the Thrive is grippy and comfortable. I never feel like I am going to drop this tablet.-Removable battery. And the back case is not as hard to remove as some reviewers have suggested. I have never had a problem removing it.What are the negative elements to the Thrive?-The biggest one, that has not been mentioned as much as it should is that currently there are a few bugs that Toshiba has not caught before shipping. Many people are experiencing a problem where the Thrive when gone into sleep mode, freezes, requiring a reset. This could be a big distraction, but I don't think anybody would argue that a patch will be released to fix this problem, hopefully soon.-The extra ports that make the Thrive so handy, also slightly add to the overall weight of the product. I am a fairly big guy, so this doesn't bother me, in fact I like it somewhat. But in reality, most people would not care for this. I need to say that the Thrive is actually lighter than my iPad with it's case on. I might not get a case for the Thrive because of the grippy back cover, which I have not mentioned yet is replaceable.-Android 3.1 is not yet as functional as the 2.x phone OS. This is not a Thrive problem, this will be the same for the Transformer, Xoom(3.2 coming soon) and others. When Toshiba updates to 3.2 there things will be smoother in many areas.-The power button and volume rocker is in a bad position with buttons that are hard to find. Google it, many people hate this.Neutral elements-The Thrive uses a very Toshiba like charger. It is not USB, and is attached to a small power brick. A typical laptop charger. This is not a negative thing though, since I have noticed that the device charges in 2 hours.-Camera front and back, no flash.-Screen is plastic, no gorilla glass. But very very durable. There are videos on the internet that show people trying to scratch the screen. If you are questioning the screen, Google these videos.If you get it..

I have not owned a tablet yet, but after doing a lot of research, I decided to purchase this one. It has a lot of advantages over other tablets.Pros:- File System: The file system in this tablet is great! It allows you to view files just like on a PC. I have heard some folks say they've had problems plugging in external drives that are written in FAT32, but I have had no issues. It's super easy to just drag and drop files from your computer onto the device with no iTunes or other programs!- Extra ports: This unit has so many ports and it makes it very versatile. I use the SD card slot frequently for cheap storage of files and transferring files around. These ports, combined with the file system, make it very much like a normal PC and it can connect to many other devices.- Battery: The user replaceable battery is great for power users. You can easily buy a backup battery to take with you if you need more power. The battery life is decent but not spectacular. I can normally get 7-10 hours depending on what I am doing. However, it recharges very quickly, only taking about an hour or so.- Web browser: This tablet supports Flash and does pretty well with browsing the Internet. I have had the browser crash on me if I am trying to load a huge Flash file though, so it's not perfect. However, the speed is great.- Keyboard: This unit has Bluetooth and a USB port, so it's really easy to plug in a keyboard if you need to do any amount of typing. Typing on the touch screen can be sort of annoying, but it's easier than any other tablet to rectify.Cons:- Thickness: This tablet is pretty thick, which may be a turn off for some people. I find it doesn't weigh that much more than other tablets, but it is a lot thicker. This tablet doesn't pretend to be pretty while sacrificing ports, so it's a trade off.- Lack of tablet apps: I've been able to run most Android phone apps on this tablet, but there's not a ton of Honeycomb-Tablet specialized apps on the market. However, I am sure more will be released with time.- Cameras and buttons: I find the cameras on this unit are not very good. The are decent, but nothing that spectacular. They are probably about as good as a low end webcam. The power button can also be hard to reach sometimes. It's not too horrible, but you need to try if you want to turn it off.Some people are saying they have trouble with the screen brightness. However, if you just turn off auto brightness, the tablet is very bright. This does drain the battery more though. I have yet to have an issue with having to hard reboot it from sleep mode, but people have reported that as an issue as well.Overall, I love this tablet. It doesn't look as slim or as pretty as some other tablets, but it's very functional.

That in itself is amazing. I feel like I got the deal of the century.16gb is lots of room to play with. There were some complaints of people saying they could only READ usb and SD card media, but I have no trouble reading AND writing to sd card and USB. Also, I tested watching movies on it and it worked, I tested watching movies and playing games thru the HDMI on my tv and that worked, I play my favorite games with my friends faster than I do on my Android cell phone, I love the big screen and think it has a great picture, the audio quality and volume is acceptable, it connects to any network and security I throw at it, bluetooth pairs with stuff easily, the USB works better than I expected (I even hooked up a 4 port USB hub and tried 2 flash drives and that worked!)... hmm what else? Oh the camera is decent and I don't mind the placement of the front camera even though I saw some complaints about that. It's fast and the nvidia really makes a difference! It multitasks nicely, sometimes I forget to close apps and you wouldn't even know it. OMG the best thing! I forgot to tell you! It charges ridiculously fast and holds a great charge all day for me! I'm assuming it's to do with the slightly larger charger that people are complaining about. I'm glad the charger is larger because if that means I can charge to 100% in about an hour and be on my way, that's fantastic. Why is anyone focusing on the size of the charger? I picture all these people complaining about how heavy these 1 pound or less items are to be extreme lazy weaklings that eat nothing but sugary foods all day and just lay around in front of a TV saying, \"omg I have to use a muscle, my life sucks, all I want to do is whine and complain about stuff and lay around\"I see why this tablet is called the iPad crusher, I don't have any desire to have an iPad now that I have this.

Welch", "ReviewID": "RHO7VWJX2S53W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There are myriad tablets on the market these days and most, it seems, resemble a smart phone rather than a laptop. For those who wish their tablet to be closer in function and capability to their laptop but less bulky and cumbersome for use in various circumstances and places, the Toshiba Thrive 10.1 is the answer.While there are some who complain that Thrive weighs in at a \"heavyweight\" (for tablets) 1.6 pounds, and is slightly over half an inch thick, there are those, like myself, who simply appreciate the convenience of having not just a USB, but also a mini-USB, as well as a full SD/SDHC/SDXC card slot, along with full HDMI, for 720p video output. The ability to add storage with USB or SD is exactly what the doctor ordered for this user.The speed of the Thrive should satisfy most anyone, offering a 1 GB internal DDR2 memory, 1 GHz NVIDIA Tegra 2 dual-core mobile processor, GeForce graphics, and all powered by Android 3.1 Honeycomb. I am not a gamer so cannot speak to that, but movies run seemlessly. Thrive has rich and vibrant screen color which is on par with any tablet that I have tested/sampled on the market today, and is, actually, better than most, while allowing us to adjust the LED backlit display as we like. That comes in handy for tweaking color just a tad.The ease of customizing settings and the entirety of the interface is very satisfying, all without having to plod through a dreaded User's Manual. And, anyway, aren't user's manuals only for reference when one finds themselves in a jam? (Mostly serious on that last comment/question...I hate user's manuals, if you couldn't tell.) I was able to set up my interface the way I wanted within minutes.Of course Thrive comes standard with stereo speakers and headphone jack, GPS, digital compass, Adobe Flash support, and a dock connector port. I have not yet purchased the dock but the other functions on my 8GB unit work great. I have not noticed any flaws in sound quality, as some reviewers have mentioned. The back cover detaches and, aside from being able to customize Thrive's exterior color scheme (I prefer and have Blue Moon) provides access to a removable battery. I find that the ability to access and change, if ever needed, the battery a nice plus.The Wireless-N works great and it is easily tethered to any free hotspot encountered. The 5mp back facing camera works good but I do not really plan to use it much as I own Nikon DSLRs. The 2mp front facing camera is more than adequate for its job.All in all, for a person looking for a reliable, fast, well-built tablet that acts and works more like a laptop than a smart phone, then Thrive is a perfect choice.", "Date": "November 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not perfect, but not bad either", "Author": "Curt Rapp", "ReviewID": "R3E7B1PFNNUX39", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The first tablet I tried was a Galaxy Tab.  It had a great display, was light weight, and very fast.  However, it lacked support for SD cards or thumb drives and only had a proprietary USB connector for recharging and file transfer.  My review of the Thrive is somewhat a comparison between the two.  The Thrive is much heavier and thicker.  That makes it feel much more substantial than the Galaxy and allows for a full sized USB and HDMI ports and a mini-USB port.  It also supports full size SD cards.  The back has a waffled surface for better grip and is removable to allow for battery change out which is not possible on the Galaxy.  You can change the back out for different colors, but that's just fluff and the backs are expensive.  The Thrive control buttons aren't as easy to find by feel and the power light is annoying.  It also blinks while in standby which shortens battery life.  I haven't found a way to turn it off, but that would be a great option.  The display quality is somewhat lower on the Thrive compared to the Galaxy.  Also, there seems to be big difference in overall speed between the Galaxy and the Thrive.  I don't know if it's different chipsets or firmware or both, but it's noticeable.  You can't video conference over Skype because the Thrive uses the Tegra chipset and many Android apps available for my Droid phone aren't for the Thrive.  One big drawback is the Thrive uses a 120v recharging brick which means you can't use the USB cable for charging.  The big factor is the Thrive is $100 cheaper than the Galaxy.  Given the lower cost, full size USB port and SD card support, and similar displays the Thrive is my pick.

A antivirus? If you've got a problem where you need an antivirus on your tablet, you may need to rethink what you're doing with your technology. All stock apps require a MONTHLY fee! (Except for the NFS game. I believe.) I don't mind paying $2 for an app, or $20 if it's worth it. BUT DO NOT Stick me with a monthly cost. WTF is wrong with you???Let alone, they're all system apps, you can't delete them. (Awaiting root.)I didn't like the home screen/launcher. It was just too awkward to use (just too different from stock Android). So since I have paid for LauncherPro, I downloaded that from the market and installed it on my tablet. It's not the best, and had to do some major configuration, but it works. And allows me to hide the system apps that are junk. I'm sorry but device manufactures need to stop making software, and just make hardware... quit customizing an OS or Additional Software, with crap we don't need, or want. (Update: Yes I realize that the launcher is the default android launcher for 3.x, I may go back to it. But I like the customization I can do with LauncherPro. LauncherPro is the android 2.x launcher/home screen source code, with some customization capabilities added in. Not meant to be an advertisement, but credit is due.)I'm a little disappointed that Toshiba, isn't more open with allowing rooting. They've made some strides to make it more difficult, but I don't think it's impossible to root the thing.USB doesn't provide enough power or something to allow my YubiKey to work. To get around it, I got a powered usb hub, and got it to work. I use the YubiKey for work VPN, and if I can get the VPN configured correctly, the USB port working with the yubikey is a must. Everything else seems to work on the USB... maybe it's just a little shy on power. (USB Hard drives that rely on additional usb power also don't work.)It acts a little funny when sleeping. I have it set to not turn off the wifi, but the wifi light goes off when sleeping. (I don't know if the wifi is off or not, yet.) Also it wakes up randomly...

Just go check out some app reviews in the \"Android Market\" and you'll find that some of the other more popular tablets, like the Galaxy are listed more often with bad reviews of apps because the app doesn't work with their proprietary architecture, and application of the Android Operating System. There are inconsistencies and incompatibilities in some of those other devices.2)  In my experience, my Toshiba has had NO PROBLEM running any app that doesn't have universal problems. But, by avoiding those apps that have less that 3 to 4 stars or better, I have rarely had problems. And the problems are fixed quickly by the developers because they're universal problems and they update them quickly.3)  I have had absolutely no mechanical problems with this tablet and have used and appreciated the full sized ports on this device. I also love being able to add another GB of Secure Digital (SD) card slot, compatible with SD, SDHC, and SDXC media. Just be careful and make sure you ***unmount*** your Toshiba from your computer before disconnecting it from the USB port, or you could damage the SD card, especially the 'micro' cards. Also, if you remove the SD card from the Toshiba, be sure to ***unmount*** from the tablet as well. When the SD card is installed, there is an icon in the lower right shaped like the card. Just tap on that icon and a pop up offers the option to dismount the card. It's that simple. The trick is... Remembering to do it.4)  If you've read the reviews suggesting an unusually fragile screen? I wouldn't be too concerned. Granted, it's not the \"Gorilla Glass\" I've read about and would really like, but I've had NO problem with mine. Of course, I avoid leaving it on the dash in the car in extreme heat or cold. I have a case to help protect in and to use as a stand. And, I'm careful not to put undue pressure on the device in any way. As far as resolution. The only thing that might be better is the iPad or iPods. But without Adobe Flash, you can't get the streaming video like You-Tube. And I've enjoyed using You-Tube too much to sacrifice it.I truly hope this is helpful.Walt B", "Date": "June 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Tablet for the Price", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RXOXQFG4W1SJF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I investigated tablets for a long time, trying to decide which one to get.  I finally narrowed it down to the Toshiba Thrive because of the external storage options.  I wanted a full size USB as well as SD card options.  This has both, as well as micro USB and the HDMI ports.  I use the USB port to hook up a USB expander and I hook up my keyboard, my mouse and when I use one--a flash drive.  I use the SD card slot as well.  I knew that I would be using my tablet like a laptop, so I wanted those options, that's why the other tablets didn't appeal to me.  I also like to have external storage, I don't like to be forced to save my data in a \"cloud\".  I got my tablet (the Toshiba Thrive 32gb) about a month ago, and I am so happy with it.  I have been able to do everything I wanted to so far.  I was thrilled with the idea of having a laptop-like device that could sync with my phone, therefore all of my apps, contacts, info. etc. was easily available on my tablet, literally within minutes I was up and running.  All I had to do was download my apps and voila--I could access all my \"stuff\" on either my tab or my phone.

I use my phone for photos.As far as internet, I tether it to my phone's hot spot, it works exceptionally well.The tablet itself is a little heavy, and a little thicker than the newer models out there--this is because of the full size USB port I believe, but if you're looking for lightweight, you're gonna have to go with something newer and more expensive, but less flexible.  You just have to weigh your needs/wants in a tablet.  When using the tablet out of the case, it is really easy to hold on to because of the rubberized backing, you don't feel like it's gonna slip out of your hands.Honestly though, if you want something with all the port options this has, you will not be disappointed because all of its features measure up.A great buy for the money.

I've got it set up with the free Hacker Keyboard app to emulate a desktop keyboars when not using my Logitech Bluetooth keyboard, and use the PenGo stylus for drawing. Stellar experience any way. I'm typing this review using the keyboard app, as a matter of fact, and can type almost as fast as on a standard keyboard.Pros:- Great battery life. Don't know the hours measurement,but I use it almost contstantly every day and charge it at night. Charges in flash.- Works very well for taking notes, which is what I got it for. Plays games pretty well too, but that's not why I bought it.- Got a factory refurb and it looks and performs like new for $100 less- Protable, lightweight, easy to use- I can even do programming on it using a Terminal program, even ssh to the Computer Engineering servers to do my homework. With the Bluetooth keyboard, it might even be better at it than my 12\" HP tablet pc laptop.- Rotates all four directions... confused the heck out of my boyfriend for a few minutes :DCons:- Freezes occasionally. Fix this by just holding the power button until it shuts off and the LED blinks once, then power onas normal. Had to do this six or seven times so far.- Refused to boot after one of the above resets, but I just held the volume up key while powering on and cold-booted and it worked.- Sometimes when locked, the power button won't wake it, even with the lock slider set to off- Even on a 10\" screen, no soft keyboard will be comfortable enough for long periods of use. Get a Bluetooth keyboard. Trust me on this.- Not many cases for it that I like, but I'm picky. I wanted a silicone skin like I have on my phone, but that still allows use of the multimedia dock. No luck.- Fingerprint magnet. Solved by using a stylus, but that only works as long as you aren't typing on the screen.All in all though, I'm very impressed and the pros greatly outweight the cons in my mind.", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "AMAZING", "Author": "Tarjita", "ReviewID": "RI74T851H6V8W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "LOVE LOVE LOVE. This tablet is LOVE!!!! :D I own a Toshiba laptop and it has never failed me in over 5 years now - I trust Toshiba products so after A LOT of tablet research, i thought i'd give it a go - I bought this tablet for my mother on her birthday and it was the best choice ever!!!!!It has so many features you run out of time to make use of them all!It runs everything so smoothly, its super fast, extremely responsive and sooo comfortable to hold! - plus, It worked gorgeously when connected to the TV through the HDMI!Basically from the first day we had it on our hands it has given us tons of fun and not a single problem - we were hooked and still are! lol.In my opinion is one of the best tablets I have ever seen!Honestly, I dont know why people are so whinny, I think they do not give it a try and time enough to discover things properly - This is a stunning product - I did not have a single problem with the wifi or whatever else they complain about.To the person who whined about it not having reading apps - you are seriously mistaken, (besides the OBVIOUS option that you can just simply download one for free from the THOUSANDS in the android market) The tablet actually comes with the Toshiba BooksPlace which is a reader and also a store, just after you create an user there, you get over 8 free books which start to automatically download, and also you get to sideload your own books into the app and buy others if you want - its a gorgeous reading application!I can do everything on it and more, so I have something to tell to those people:  R-E-L-A-X.  This is an android Tablet, not a miracles worker to fix all your life's stressing problems. Go to a therapist. If the sky is grey, don't blame it on the tablet. Jesus.The Toshiba Thrive is a fine candy - It exceeded ALL my expectations and just blew me away! I do not regret a single penny spent on thisMy boyfriend just ordered one now and we are terribly anxious to get it! :DIpads are extremely overvalued and overpriced - and honestly, its all appearances because it fails at several things I find ridiculous that they cant accomplish well for the nearly 500 bucks that it costs.You can get far FAR more with THIS tablet, for only 380$ on the 8gb version which you can expand to 32gs more with a simple SD card.My mother is extremely happy with her gift, my boyfriend will have his on a couple weeks, and I am now saving some for my own, soon :DLOVE.

It was a refurbished unit and had a very attractive price of only $285 including shipping. The tablet is spotless and performs very well. I wasn't sure about buying a refurbished unit but am happy I did since it was only $285. That's about half the price of a 16GB iPad and $100 less than buying a new Thrive.Besides the low price, another reason I was really drawn to this unit was the ports: full USB, HDMI, SD card. I love that I can hook it up to my HD TV HDMI and stream anything from the internet to my TV. I also LOVE the full SD slot. That's a really useful feature for me. I can take digital photos with my digital SLR and then pop the SD card directly into the Thrive and start browsing my photos instantly. That's a HUGE feature if you're traveling and want to view your pictures on a larger screen and not have to lug around a laptop.I've had it for about 2 weeks now and am really loving it. I've downloaded tons of apps and they all work well except for a CNN app that seems to crash sometimes when I open a video. No big deal though as I have plenty of other news source apps to choose from.One little glitch I found early on was in the File Manager app. If you are browsing photos on an SD card, you cannot swipe the screen to flip between photos. If you tap the photo, a little toolbar appears at the bottom with a \"Play\" (slideshow) button, forward and backward arrows to browse to the next or previous photos. None of this works unfortunately. I called Toshiba and spoke to a nice woman who admitted the bug and said it's easily remedied by using the Gallery or the Media Player app. Using Gallery is my preferred method. The swiping and animation it shows as it flips to the next photo works perfectly as well as the slideshow feature. The only thing I don't like about this is you can't adjust the timing between photos in slideshow. The File Manager app had a timing slider from 3 - 10 seconds, however that didn't work of course.I wish the storage management options had a setting for storing pictures/videos taken from the device camera to the SD card instead of the system storage. My Blackberry has this option and it helps save a lot of memory.Another little glitch is that videos taken with my digital camera can't be played through either the Toshiba Media Player or the other video app that are installed by default. I had to locate a third party video player app on the Android Market and that works well. Don't know why the Toshiba apps can't play a simple .avi video from my camera, seems like a pretty basic expectation.I just received a nice cover case that I ordered from Amazon Moko(TM) Leather Folio Cover Case with Multi-Angle Stand for Toshiba Thrive 10.1-inch Android Tablet (BLACK) and also ordered and put a green back on Toshiba Thrive Colored Back Cover for 10.1-Inch Tablet - Green Apple (PA3966U-1EAG) . Both are really nice and work well. Word of warning though regarding the Moko case, it is NOT leather, it's a fake plastic leather but still very nice. Don't know how they get away with advertising it is real leather. It fits the unit perfectly though and I really love the multi-angle feature. You can adjust it just about any angle, as the bottom of the case has a small velcro strip and the inside of the case is the soft \"hooks\", so you can easily adjust it to any angle that works best, this is fantastic. I've seen other cases that have only 1 or two angle settings.I'm really happy with this device other than the minor bugs I've mentioned above. Highly recommend this unit for anyone wanting a well functioning Android tablet at about half the price of an iPad.", "Date": "February 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Tablet...Awesome price", "Author": "Grace Fellowship", "ReviewID": "R3NJPFB0MCK20W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this as a gift for my wife's birthday.

You can't do that with either one of the competitors.  Full size USB ports and Full size SD slot also beat the other tablets.  I also bought an extra power cord to use on when I travel so I won't have to unhook the multi dock station.  I have had the Thrive for a month now and I am not disappointed with any aspect of it.

I'm the type of person that does a lot of research when I am interested in trying something new. After much research and reading MANY reviews I decided to buy the 16gb Toshiba Thrive. I had a hard time getting one because it seemed that they were sold out in many stores. Anyway, I finally was able to find one ordering it on line. It only took one business day and it was here.I never had a tablet before so this is something I would have to learn to use. At this time I've had my Thrive for about 2 weeks.I just love my new Toshiba Thrive, I am learning something new everyday and I am having a hard time putting it down. no problems getting to any websites. Netflix is working great and the picture quality is very good.The apps are very easy to install and I'm enjoying many of the games. I'm still learning how to use this thing and have so much to learn. I am having some problems getting my bluetooth to connect to my printer, so I'm hoping to get that figured out soon. It shows that it is paired but not connected.So far I haven't taken many pictures but I did take one of my dog and it seems to be quite nice, however taking pictures in a dark room could be a problem with no flash on this tablet. I love the idea that I can use a full size SD card, this will be handy to show old photos that I pull off my desktop PC.Yes the tablet is thicker then other tablets out there, but it feels solid and I like that. I also love the fact that you can remove the back cover and change the battery yourself. this alone is a wonderful feature of the Thrive. the Thrive also has many accessories you can get like the colorful back covers, cases, stands, docs, etc. I just ordered the multi dock for mine and I really like it. It charges my Thrive in about an hour and I use it as a stand when not charging. It makes the Thrive look pretty classy.As far as the battery goes, I am surprised how long the charge last. I have been using my Thrive many times during the day and for hours in the evening and still have time on the battery. When I do have to put it on the charge, it only takes about an hour and I have a full charge.As of today I would buy this tablet again.

Exactly what I wanted. A way to travel without having to either load up my big ole laptop or having to preload everything to my gps. I haven't tried it with my nuvi, but I'm pretty sure it won't work since the SD slot on the nuvi is read only for the maps. The other thing is to watch movies. Took 2 days to figure out, several websites, and a lot of cussing and screaming but after looking at the Toshiba forums and etc I was able to upload my own dvd's to it. I did actually watch a movie so, yes it is possible.

As we drove away and managed to get a few blocks away I realized my precious tablet was not with me and started to go into shock. As I retraced my path and looked for my thrive. To my suprise it was laying in the street still in the case I bought. The only damage to the thrive was nothing just a lil dirt that needed to be wiped away.Now for the review and simply said its amazing. I'm an avid computer user so I needed the thrive to keep up with my laptop which I use like my life depended on it and it holds up better than expected the OS is smooth and the change between tasks is without hesitation. I've gotten at least 9 hrs out of a charge while watching some movies and playing games .External ports r always a plus I just hook the thrive up to my flat screen and instant Netflix or just a bigger computer screen. The external hard drive makes movies and music simple even though there is already plenty of internal storage and the SD card makes pictures from cameras and upload to fb or ur favorite. Sight extremely easy.Things I recommend1. A Case they come in handy and make handling the tablet very efficient2.amazon app. Place  you will thank me later for that one considering half my games come from the marketplace plus with android most things are free.3.nothing more needed that's just how easy and self sufficient the thrive is there are a few other reviews on here that have great app. Ideas but I don't have the time and I've typed this whole thing on my thrive in just under 8 min plus I'm watching TV so there u have it pick one up today and leave the Ipad and other over priced devices to the in suspecting mass's", "Date": "January 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Galaxy Tab user", "Author": "WearSunScreen", "ReviewID": "R3UVV2G00T6CSX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own and use a Galaxy tab.

My expectations were actually pretty low. I have messed around with various tablet devices for several years, and had yet to have a good experience. This tablet changes all of that. I love my iPhone and so I thought about an iPad but I don't need thousands of apps, nor do I need to be tied down to a specific software or service for multimedia content either. I also hate to pay big money for a crippled piece of hardware with no easy access to storage media.Back toi this Android tablet, first of all the hardware is amazing. The full size SD card slot works flawlessly, I have a 64gb card in there and I can store tons of movies, music and photos no problem. The USB port takes all of my USB flash drives as well as adapters for additional SD cards. That way, I can leave the internal SD card in there and still access photos on an SD card from my digital camera at the same time. The full size HDMI port and mini-usb to transfer data are usefull as well. The screen is great and the touch control is nearly perfect. The cameras are okay and work fine for Google Talk. I haven't tried to take any real photos yet, but I have a phone and camera for that anyway. The slight extra weight and thickness for such a full featured tablet is a no brainer, it is well worth the trade-off.Software is the other great thing, there are hundreds of apps, mostly free, to do just about anything you would want. One of the most amazing apps I have found is the ES File Manager. With this I can actually browse my windows shares on my network and copy files or even play movies and music directly with no special software or configuration. Another thing that blew me away was the included app to print to your networked printers. This also worked flawlessly, it is a trial, but I am definitely going to go ahead and pay for the full app.My only complaints are very nit-picky. The screen looks a little washed out, but only ever so slightly, just enough to be a tiny bit annoying, but not bad. In fact, if you fiddle with the brightness for any given ambient light it can look quite nice. I purchased a matte finish screen protector and that helped to boost the contrast slightly. Unfortunately, the screen protectors are very hard to apply and make text slightly soft. On the positive side, the screen protectors make the screen surface much more manageable in terms of not accumulating grease from your fingers and reducing glare. So, overall I think the matte finish screen protector is worth the few neagatives. As many have said, the power button is a little goofy, kind of hard to find and press, but once you get used to it, no big deal. Lastly, it does take a tiny bit of tech savvy to get around in the Android OS and get software to do just what you want, but nothing totally over the top either. I fully expected to have to root the device to get some of the capabilities I wanted but so far there has been an app for everything I would like to do with it. I did have to tweak ES File Manger to start from / so I could get to the mount point for the secondary SD Card but that took like two seconds, and very basic knowledge of file systems, so no biggie.Overall, I would highly recommend this tablet to anybody. If you want to get the maximum functionality from it, and you are not technically inclined, you may want to get a techie friend to help you tweak a few things.

I have not had the sleep issue that had been reported,While the Thrive is slightly thicker and heaver than most tablets, I don't find this to be a problem.  The wide band around the screen is actually a plus.  It allows for a better grip on the tablet as does the rubberized backThe tablet connects to Wi-Fi quickly.  No problems with traveling to a new location and selecting a new Wi-Fi.For a touch typing, touch screens are difficult. However the Thrive has voice recognition that works very well.  I now speak my email while the Thrive types it for me.  You must remember to have a slight pause between words.  Words that sound the same but spelled differently do confuse the tablet (to, too, two) and may need to be typed in.  Just like a smart phone, you need to check before you send.Tuning on maps brings up your current location.  I was pleased to find that voice recognition works with maps.  I was able to select maps; touch the microphone button and say \"Tampa, Florida\" and the map quickly appeared.  Then traveling to Central America I was pleased to find that it had the map of the small mountain town of Boquete, Panama.  It included locations of some important places.  My Garmin GPS did not have all the roads that were on the Thrive.  Why did I pay $150 for the inferior Garmin map?  It also has a digital compass that helps you navigate. I plan to try it out on other locations outside the USA and expect good results.Two problems:1. The cameras are on the middle left side when you hold the tablet in landscape mode.  This is right where you normally put your hand.  If the cameras were moved to the upper left it would make it perfect.2. I have a hard time getting the Thrive away from my wife.

That Apple doesn't make their products with replaceable batteries says volumes to me. The products are designed to fail. I had an IPhone and by the end of the contract with the phone company the back of the phone was cracked and the screen had many dead spots. No offense to Apple fans but I would rather have choice of who manufactures my tech devices and andoid gives me that. My new Motorola phone is much more solid and I feel confident that I can keep it past the contract date until something truly interesting comes out.

I've read that it's a bit thick but it wasn't as bad as I expected. The device seems fairly rugged and well made. After the set up it installed the latest version of the firmware so I haven't had any of the problems as discussed in some of the past reviews. The update didn't cause any problems but I didn't have an files or apps installed. I don't know if would have required a total reset which may be problematic if you already have files installed. I seem to get 7 to 9 hours with the battery while watching netflix or reading books using the kindle app but I do have my screen brightness a bit lower than the default or the automatic setting. The battery charge time seems to be very quick, only about 35 to 40 min for a complete charge. I'm impressed with all the included ports but what really sold me was the removable battery. For that alone it makes the thrive a competitive tablet. I'm not a fan of Apple products since everything must function through itunes but many people don't consider the cost and time replacing something as simple as a battery when buying an apple product or some of the other android tablets. The included android 3.1 makes it easy to run third party apps and things such as keyboards and mice. Although few apps have been created to take advantage, the Thrives nvidia processor makes games and apps explode when it comes to graphics and speed. My only negative with the Thrive is the chrome bezel around the front facing camera. I feel it make the tablet look a bit cheap but it's only my opinion. I also hope they release an update that gives you the ability to turn off the front indicator lights. They can sometimes be too bright and distracting when reading or watching a movie.

No issues so far, it's worked far better than the demo one I toyed with at a local store. There in lies the rub, however; what exactly does this do that a netbook cannot? Even an inexpensive laptop really, though battery-life becomes a concern there. Considering a Netbook with 2 gig of ram and a 320 gig HD is significantly less than the cost of any decent tablet, is the touch interface really worth the difference? Not convinced. The device has been great so far, battery life lasting much longer than the \"road-test reviews\". Also, complaints about the thickness are rather silly; There comes a point at which one of these would be too thin. One drop on an uneven surface and they'd crack.

Thrive was packaged very securely with a quick Start guide that I didn't have to use.  I plugged the Thrive, turned it on, and made a few basic settings to get started.  The home screen and apps took about 5 minutes to figure out.  The system keeps track of your recently used Apps and returning to a web page or app almost instantly is a great function.  The Thrive recognized my home WIFI and connected without problems.  I registered the Thrive with Toshiba and signed up for update notifications and received Google Maps and Thrive system update.  I hooked up my logitech wireless mouse and instantly worked - no menu choices or setup required.  Decided to try the video HDMI connection and actually used Amazon Prime Free Video.  I connected the HDMI port to my 52\" Sony TV and the screen of the Thrive immediately was displayed on the TV - no setup, menus, or configuration of any kind.  I went to Amazon and pulled up the Yellowstone Park Video.  The video screen said \"not optimized for mobile\" but when I clicked on the \"popout\" (not really sure what that means) option on Amazon Video Player my TV screen was filled with the video.  I had a bar across the top with Amazon stuff because I was playing video from the Amazon Internet page.  The picture was great!!  Because I was displaying the movie from Amazon's Internet player I had to click on the display options for about a minute to get the best picture (popout option).  I controlled the video from across the room with the wireless mouse and even used the mouse to fill in the search box by clicking on the keyboard letters to find additional movies.  The video was a little choppy (not enough to interfere with enjoyment)...probably because my wireless router is G and not N (much faster).  I then played a Family Guy episode from a previous purchase on Amazon and it worked without ANY problems.....absolutely cool on how easy this thing is to use.  Hell, even the keyboard on the display is very nice size for my fat fingers.  Total use of the Thrive on day 1 was about 4 hours.Pros:  Unbelievable easy to use - I am sure having Android phone helped becuase of Settings.  Internet access, ability to jump back to previous web pages and apps almost instantly (two taps) is great.  Battery after 4 hours of playing around was still at 58%.Cons:  Keyboard sometimes had a delay when typing - I am not a typist - bothersome keying in search phrases.I gave the review 4 stars instead of 5 because of only 4 hours usage.I will add additional reviews later today after I add other email accounts and look at Excel, Word, PDF, and Power Point documents on it.

When the battery won't hold a charge anymore I don't have to ship it back to the manufacturer to have the battery changed, and wait who knows how long to get it back.The other thing that sets this apart from other tablets is the inclusion of all the ports:  there's a full-size SD card slot, full-size USB port, mini-USB port and an HDMI port.  The small hard drive size is no problem at all since it takes up to a 132 GB SD card.  The included file manager makes it so much easier to access your own files, which isn't always easy on an android device.  Of course it's a touch screen, and it does have pinch zoom/multi-touch.

I'm quite happy with the Thrive, but it's not quite an iPad. Then again, the iPad is not quite a Thrive, either.Overall, the iPad conveys more of a feeling of luxury. It's made of metal, while the Thrive feels cheaper and more plastic-y. Its animations are always smooth, while the Thrive sometimes feels a bit clunky. But that's really all I have to say about the Thrive's downsides.After using it with the installed Honeycomb for a few days, I found it could be upgraded all the way to Ice Cream Sandwich. That's a pretty nice OS, the second-most-recent Android version, with most, if not all, of the features any tablet owner could want. It's fairly slick, too.The main reasons I bought the Thrive are because it has a user-replaceable battery and because it has ports and slots for USB devices and memory cards. The iPad has none of these; when your iPad stops holding a charge, you're expected to send it off to Apple and pay a fairly hefty wad of cash to get a refurbished model in exchange. When the battery dies on the Thrive, you replace it with a battery that costs around $20-25, the last I looked.The Thrive does everything I ever did with the iPad.Bottom line -- while the iPad may be slicker, the Thrive is a great tablet that I expect to enjoy long after the battery on my old iPad has finally quit.", "Date": "February 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good features BUT not durable..", "Author": "Roitan C Angeles", "ReviewID": "RWMTQCTJO9P6X", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this product a year ago because it has better (if not the best) features than most of the other well known tablets...and of course it's Toshiba.

I have had my 10.1\" 32GB Thrive for a little over 2 months and cannot say enough good things about it.I read a previous comment that the persons Thrive was slow but that must be a rare Thrive as mine is fast fast fast! I also cannot say enough about the capabilities this awesome tablet gives you. With all it's ports etc. If you need more, you don't need this tablet, you need a clunky laptop!Another feature with this tablet seldom mentioned or even known about is the fact that you can also buy a USB Ethernet adaptor and hookup this tablet to the internet when there is no WIFI available. Several adaptors are available that work don't require a driver, so it's as simple as plugging in the USB adaptor and plugging the cable into the adaptor. Try doing that with an iPad!If you feel you can't live without a real keyboard or mouse, they also work on this tablet, just plug in the USB or use Bluetooth. I thought I would want to use a keyboard but after a few minutes on the qwerty keypad, I knew I didn't need or want an external keyboard! This tablet just does it all!I found that I liked using a \"stylus\" pen, I didn't think I would but it became easy and natural to use. The reason I started with a stylus is because it gave me pinpoint accuracy when selecting on the screen, I have large fingers and I got tired of always enlarging the screen so I wouldn't be sent off to links I had no intention of going to. I'm a fairly decent typist so I thought using a stylus would be a fuss because I would always be putting the stylus down when I type, but what I found is when I type, I just use the stylus in my right hand and use my left naturally and I fly!I just hooked up my tablet to our HDTV via it's full size HDMI port a couple of days ago and was amazed by the picture. I was watching some YouTube HD videos and the picture was like I was watching a Bluray video and we don't have a Blueray sytem! I also ran the sound back through our home theater system so between the HD and sound, this little Tablet is just a giant killer. Forget the iPad and it's limited capabilities....If you want a tablet that does it all, here it is.There has been some criticism about it's weight etc. but if you can't handle a few more ounces in weight, perhaps a 7\" tablet would work better for you. The Thrive also has a full size SD card slot (I have a 32GB in mine but it can take up to a 64GB). So if you're looking for a tablet that has memory capabilities...32GB/System+64GB/SD Card+64GB/USB = A lot of potential onboard memory for a tablet!After using the Thrive for a couple of weeks, my wife decided she wanted her own, so off to the local store I went and was lucky enough to get the same unit on clearance for substantially less than what I paid. Luckily I brought along my own receipt and got a refund on mine to match the clearance price on my wifes tablet ~ Sweet!Lastly, No, I do not work for Toshiba! My wife and I are retired so when I find something that works really well for the money, I like to share my own thoughts.Update: 7/9/12....I should also add that we also added a free Kindle App which has turned our Thrives into our libraries. There are tens of thousands of great free books online besides those found here on amazon, such as internetarchives.org...I have downloaded great books from that site right into my kindle App very easily, just click where it says \"Kindle\" in the box to the left side of the page. Can't get much better than being a Thriver Driver!7/10/12 ~ Another plus...I bought a leather \"rooCase\" for my Thrive here on Amazon for a total cost of $10.06 including delivery! Some reviews on this case indicate that it leaves a black mark on the back of the Tablet but since I have the standard black Thrive cover, no problem for me even if it does.This cover is extremely thin and fits the Thrive perfectly, all the openings and areas fit perfectly plus it is extremely lightweight. Just do a search on Amazon for \"Thrive rooCase\" and it will come up. Then go to \"2 New\" offers. I chose the $5.08 + $4.98 shipping)since I'm not a Amazon prime member. I also have the official Thrive cover with the 360 degree swivel for landscape or portrait viewing but I found that it did not sit well on the lap in the landscape mode but makes a great, very sturdy travel case.I searched on the internet and found a Red leather case for my wife's Thrive which cost $35. I found her case doing a Google search where a lady in Texas had one listed on Craigslist! I called the lady, asked about the case and if she would ship to Nevada, she was great.

The battery life is ridiculous (in a good way!) I can watch a few hours of movies a day and it will last me about 2 days before needing a charge. I love the ports and SD card slot as well (my main reason for purchasing). I just took this on a trip to NY and loaded up movies on an SD card for the plane trip, transferred pictures from my camera's SD card to the internal memory to give me more picture space, and transferred files from one SD card to another using a USB adapter for the 2nd card. Heck, if I wanted to, I could have hooked it up to the hotel TV via HDMI. For those that say the ports are outdated, I just used all of them in one weekend trip, and I wouldn't have been able to do what I needed to do any other way! The battery lasted about a day and a half after my 3 hour plane trip with movies playing via SD the entire time, some WiFi surfing in the hotel room, and transferring my files. I got it charged up again in about an hour. You can't beat that. So if you're going on a trip (for leisure), leave the laptop, you just need the Thrive for anything you need.On a side note, I have a NAS at home with my media stored on it. With the Thrive, I accessed the desktop version of my NAS while waiting in the airport and transferred a movie to my SD card. I can even watch any movie stored on my NAS on my Thrive (when there is WiFi available) from anywhere using the Skifta app.So if you're a media junkie like me and want a lightweight portable computer, the Thrive is just what you need!", "Date": "July 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Toshiba Thrive l0.1 inch l6 GB Android Tablet ATl05-T1016", "Author": "deecry", "ReviewID": "R1ZHUTQG6XYK4W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am as computer illerate as a geriatric can be.

I was new to the tab world and like most people all I had really heard about was iPad this and that. Granted the iPad is a nice, thin product but it limits a user who is looking for a tab to use as a laptop stand-in. That's what I love about the Thrive, it has so many ports that u can hook a many accessories to it, ie. Keyboard, mouse, HD TV. To top that off, Toshiba a gives you an SD card slot that makes the memory aspect of this tab limitless.Now the Thrive is a little thicker and bulkier than the iPad, but what do you expect when they've given you these expansion possibilities. Apple makes you BUY all these adapters if you want to be able to hook up external devices.Let me say a few words about the bluetooth feature. It's great! I have been able to download files from my computer and phone so easily. The Office Pro app is so wonderful to use to look and edit you MS Office documents.  Speaking of apps, I have an Android market phone and when I set up my Thrive it automatically downloaded the same apps I had on my phone. That was a real time saver.I have my tab in a portfolio that has a built in keyboard. Typing on the screen is better than typing on my phone, but I still like the feel of an actual key. The keyboard did take a little time to get used to because it's smaller than a laptop keyboard, but what a great combo to have a portfolio cover with a keyboard at ur disposal. Which, by the way, props up the tab to give you the look and feel of a laptop.??????The only reason I did not give the Thrive a 5 is because it is a little chunkier, but if thats the worst con of this product then we're in great shape. I would HIGHLY reccomend that you purchase a stylus because they make navigation more efficient and helps keep those annoying fingerprints off the screen.I enthusiastically reccomend this tab to someone who is in the market for one.

Unlike other USB chargers, this power adapter fully charged the Thrive in less than 2 hours.  The USB chargers for Kindle Fire and iPad takes 3-4 hours to be fully charged.User InterfaceToshiba Thrive is very responsive.  Loaded with Honeycomb 3.1, it is a pleasure to work with.  Everything is highly customizeable.  My wife's iPad environment is so closed sometimes I feel handicapped.  The Kindle Fires OS is also a closed environment but for my kids, it is perfect.  Nook Color is crap.  One thing I do not like is the power button.  It is located on the top right and it is very hard to depress.  At times, I press the volume rocker instead of the power button.AppsGoing into Android MarketPlace is seemless.  I was able to load Amazon AppStore without any trouble.  The first thing I did was to install Skype, Netflix and Anti-Virus software.  Android is a virus mecca, you can go very wrong if you install the wrong apps.I loaded Netflix and some of the videos did stutter.  Not sure why.  I tried some game apps they worked very well.  I especially like \"Where's My Water\" from Amazon AppStore.CameraThe cameras for the back and front are very week.  Taking pictures using these cameras produce very grainy photos.  I honestly don't understand the reason to have cameras beside making Skype calls.  So this is not a big deal.ExpansionsComparing to all the tables that I have, Toshiba Thrive is surely a winner.  SD card, USB port, HDMI output are excellent.  After we took some digital photos using our Canon SLR, I can quickly view them using my Thrive.  The Thrive produces very sharp photos.  Sure beats the needs to turn on my PC to download photos.  I cannot do any of these on the iPad, Nook Color or Kindle Fire.Build QualityThe entire unit looks solid and very well made, even for a refurbished unit.  The only thing I don't like is the back cover, which can be detached.  When I hold the back, I could feel it flexes, which gives the feeling of \"don't break it\".  The Thrive is the thickest among all the tablets that I have.  I plan to use it to do quick view of the web and some entertainment through the web.  I am using Thrive to replace all the Windows laptops that I have.  The thickness is not a deal breaker.I love this tablet for the price and its functionality.  I hate Windows.  Anything that I can use to replace Windows is fine with me.  That brings up the next point, you will never see me buy another Window laptop or Window tablet.Update March 21, 2012I bought this refurbished Thrive.  One thing I found out was it cannot be updated due to the wrong image that was installed.  This is a common problem for all refurbished Thrives.Also, Toshiba Thrive also turns on by itself for no apparent reason.  I searched the web and found out that this is a common problem with no clear solutions.Update May 10, 2012Toshiba had a push update on the Thrive.  There was an image update dated September.  For some reason I couldn't update my Thrive.  So I tried the image updated dated October.  That seemed to work.  Finally, another image update dated March finally update my thrive to Android 3.2.  I could tell that my Thrive is a lot speedier.  Will this fix the \"auto\" turn on problem.

My main use was going to be for travel, I wanted to have something with me that could get on the internet and had a larger screen than my smart phone. I say \"was\" because I find myself picking it up to use instead of walking over to my computer. This product is perfect, it has a large clear screen, it's lightweight and I picked up how to use it right away.  The only complaint that I have regarding the product is the power cord, I would think that such a small device would have a small cord but it reminds me of a mini computer power cord even with a box in the middle of the cord.  Annoying when your trying to pack one carry on bag and you already have a bunch of other cords and clothes along.  I guess that if this was the only complaint that I have, it must be a good product right?One other issue that I'm putting here as well as a complaint to Amazon, that has already been filed, is about the shipping.  The product was ordered on Jan 11 and I received it on the 14th using their standard shipping, great turn around and not the problem!!  What was unfortunate was that whatever company did the shipping knocked on the door and then left my package on the doorstep.  I live in an apartment complex, had I not been home (there was no way for them to know I was) I doubt that package would have still been there by the time I got back.  When the tablet was left, my apartment leasing office was open (they always accept packages) and I do even have a patio that they could have dropped it on.  I just want others to be aware that you might want to track your package and try to make sure someone is home so the same issue doesn't happen to you.", "Date": "January 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Thrive Beats Them All", "Author": "Dale L.

I like it because i can swap SD cards from my cameras and computers quickly to my tablet, without any messing with transfering to the micro SD and hunting down the adapter.  Also, a replacable battery was a key component for me. I have had my notebook battery die and thankfully i can replace it, and my cell phone batteries never last much more than 2 years or less, so i have replaced them.  I didn't want to be stuck sending in the entire tablet for battery replacement. I can order one up and replace it. With this, the tablet is thinker than the competition, but i like it since it is easer to keep a grasp on it.  with the ruberized back on this too, it easier to grip and seem more protected. With the screen shield, this thing seem more durable.

I primarily use the thrive for web surfing and email, and it works great for that, lasting a full day before needing to charge at night.I got the 16GB version and haven't noticed any need for memory expansion. however the full size SD card slot is a great feature to have, as are the full size ports. Some folks have complained about the LED lights on the frame but they don't bother me at all.Netflix works well on this device for those of you who like to watch TV and movies on your pad. But he speakers are a bit lacking. I'd recommend good set of external speakers or headphones if you are going to use it for movies or music.Typing on the 10\" screen using the android keyboard is easier than I thought. Still not quite as easy as a real keyboard, but transitioning from a tiny Acer notebook keyboard was easier than I expected. Still, I would like to eventually get an external bluetooth keyboard for it.I've plugged in a wireless USB mouse and it recognized it immediately. Copying and pasting in android is a bit difficult (for me) using the touch screen, but the mouse makes it a lot easier. If you plan on using this to make or edit documents I believe a real keyboard and mouse are going to be essential. But for quick emails, messaging and forum posts (recommend tapatalk app) you could do a lot worse.I also was not put off by the thickness of this tablet. A lot of reviews gave it a hard time for it's thickness but it still beats a laptop any way you slice it.The dual cameras are nice enough, though I'd like to see a bit more thought put into them. This isn't a problem unique to the Thrive. It seems that all of these all-in-one android devices could use a little work in the camera department. I'd like to see a real camera flash like you'd find on a point and shoot pocket camera, and I'd like to  see a bit higher resolution, and more user control over aperture, shutter speed, and ISO. I take a lot of product pictures for my little hobby business and a better camera built in would simplify things and reduce some clutter in the office. Again, this isn't a Thrive gripe, just a technology gripe in general. I know that the big reason they don't put great flashes is the battery life they consume. So why not add a dual AAA cell battery port separate from the rechargeable internal battery? This can then be used to power the camera flash without taxing the main battery, and allow you to include better camera features. (Make it so the port can charge NiMh AAAs.)It's my understanding that the hardware is capable of running Ice Cream Sandwich so I'd like to see Toshiba offer an update to that OS version.Another thing that drew me to this particular model is the user replaceable battery pack. If you use this every day for a year your battery pack will have lost quite a lot of it's initial capacity. It's nice to be able to just order a replacement.And finally, another general thought about android, I love that it is so much simpler than windows! If you are thinking about getting a computer for your grandpa, mother or aunt who managed to live in a cocoon during the last 30 years, this is going to be the easiest OS to learn. A far better option than trying to teach someone windows from scratch.", "Date": "December 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "awesome", "Author": "me", "ReviewID": "R3VEHTFESU4HZP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have to put something in here.

I have used my regular laptop only a few times since having the Thrive the last couple months, you can do anything on it. It seems to have great sound as well. I have seen a few complaints about the volume, but mine seems to get quite loud.

Pre-ordered the Thrive June 13th, the first day it was eligible for pre-order. Also, I love Toshiba as a company. With that out of the way..The Thrive is a fantastic device. I haven't read any of the other reviews, so I'm probably going to repeat what they've said, but oh well. Starting with the physical device:- The screen is very responsive and slick, although you will notice finger prints after minor-moderate use (I notice mine after a couple hours of playing games), but that's to be expected from any touch-based device. They wipe away cleanly and easily with a cloth.- While people seem to say that the device is heavy and bulky, I disagree. I think that the size is perfect, and I have had no problem with my arms getting tired after (literally) holding the device for hours without setting it down (side note: it is a great enough device to want to use it for hours at a time without setting it down.)- The standard hardware set (Tegra 2 processor, 10.1\" screen, 1 GB RAM) works very well with Gingerbread (Android 3.1 OS). Everything is responsive and I've had no issues with the device being too slow or getting overloaded (and I have not overclocked the processor yet.)- One of my favorite features are the ports: full USB, mini USB, and full size HDMI. The USB supports keyboards, flash drives/external hard drives formatted under FAT (a future OS update will likely support NTFS, as well.) The HDMI port allows me to very easily hook the Thrive up to my HDTV, which I do every night to watch some shows online to fall asleep.- The contours on the back of the case make holding the tablet feel natural and easy. The extra grip keeps the Thrive from slipping from your hands (I've had mine since July 13th, and have not dropped it once.)- The battery lasts for approximately 7 hours of continuous use (roughly), although I haven't had any problems with the battery life. Even if I did, it charges to 90% in an hour. However, in order to do that, the Thrive (unlike, I assume, every other tablet on the market) charges with an AC adapter, like a laptop, rather than through a USB connection. So you need a power outlet or a car adapter to charge it, rather than just a USB connection, but in my opinion the super fast charging makes it worth it.- The 16 GB version I have, plus the 16 GB (full size) SD card means that I basically have as much space as I can possibly ever need. (Be careful with SD cards; some require a little hack to get them to work on the Thrive/PC, which requires taping over a small hole in the card. Google it if you have any problems; takes minutes to fix and causes no problems.)On the software side:- The android market has responded very well to Android 3.0/3.1, thanks to the Xoom and Tab leading the pack by a couple of months, putting many great games and apps out there to keep you entertained.- While there are many great apps that are compatible with the device, the reality is that this is not Apple and what works on one device won't necessarily work on another. You will have apps that (randomly) force close, and ones that you can't even install on the device because a company (see: HBO and Hulu) refuse to give you the option to get it to work yourself until they develop an app specifically for that OS and device.- Android 3.1 runs very smoothly with almost no hiccups. The setup of the home screens allows you to place hundreds of apps/widgets across the huge screen, although it does currently lack the ability to create folders. While there aren't really any reasons you need to create a folder since you have plenty of space on the home screens, I find it a bit odd that it doesn't even give you the option.- The included Toshiba File Manager is fantastic. I've used it to browse the internal HD as well as the SD card, and I find myself using it almost daily to clear up downloads and folders that like to stick around after an app is uninstalled (unfortunately, some apps still do that. Hoped that would end once you get off the PC, but what can you do.)- The Toshiba App Place is an interesting app to find some properly developed and supported applications, but it's still very sparse and almost everything has to be paid for. Additionally, the interface for it is fairly clunky, most apps don't have photos of the app in use (just a logo that is bannered across the top and an icon for the app), and they are oddly subscription based ($9.99/month) rather than a one-time fee.Problems/bugs/glitches:- One of the main problems (which, allegedly, is going to be fixed next week) is a sleeping bug. When you turn the device \"off\" (push the power button once to black the screen, or let it sit for a few minutes and it does it itself) it actually enters a low-power sleep state. Sometimes, randomly, when you go to wake it up, it just doesn't wake up. The LED lights up like it's on, but the screen stays black and requires a hard restart to be operational again.- To my surprise, Toshiba has locked down the device a fair amount. For most users, this isn't likely a problem. However, I would like to uninstall some of the bloatware (included software that does nothing but take up space and annoy you, usually running in the background) and to run a custom version of Flash so that I can watch Hulu videos (one of the most important uses for a tablet, in my opinion), but Toshiba does not permit the user to uninstall the application, and it can't just be overridden. Although, many of the folders are hidden as they are considered \"system\" folders, which disallows you from editing some of the files for certain applications (if the app wasn't made to run on 3.1 and needs a little tweak, why can't I just edit a config file and do it myself?).- To continue with the above, rooting the Thrive is still in its infancy. The above wouldn't be much of a big deal if I could just root my device, get superuser access, and just do what I want on the device, but that is currently not an option (well, not unless you want to run the risk of soft-bricking your device (someone had said that since all the editing is done from the boot manager, it can't actually be fully bricked, but you can end up wiping the stock ROM, making it unable to be used for anything until you install a new one or recover the old one.)It might sound like that are a fair amount of negatives with the device, but it's much easier to point out what doesn't work than what does work. And overall, the Thrive works amazingly. It's by far been my best purchase in the past 12 months, if not longer. If you're looking for an android tablet that works great and has one of the best companies behind it, the Thrive is for you. I have a roll up USB keyboard that I can just pack with me wherever I go. Set the Thrive up on a stand, plug in the keyboard, and I basically have an ultra-portable computer/gaming device/web browser/movie and TV show viewer. All in all, I would give the Thrive a 4.8 if I could, but because of some current issues am forced to round it down to a 4. That being said, if you purchase the Thrive, you will not be disappointed.", "Date": "July 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Update issues, but otherwise quite enjoyable", "Author": "Mitch10 \"mitch10\"", "ReviewID": "R1FC4LMM193G30", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I pre-ordered on Amazon so got the Thrive on July 11.  Overall, I am very pleased and won't repeat in detail all the merits of the tablet but instead briefly describe what I especially like and a couple of faults that prevent me from giving it 5 full stars.On the plus side; I use a usb keyboard for taking notes in meetings but found I can semi-touch type on-screen with the tablet on a table; this was an unexpected surprise.  Dolphin HD browser works great and very much like a laptop experience in terms of rendering and speed.  I've even streemed some movies from Amazon with total stupefaction.  If I'm using the Thrive for checking email, light surfing and a game or two, the battery will last a full 2 days. Documents and PDFs render quite nicely on the Thrive and I can even work in spreadsheets comfortably.Now for the 2 quibbles. Sometimes applications will shut down unexpectedly.  This most likely is app-specific Honeycomb issues, but there's no way to know for sure just yet.  Second and worse.  Although it's nice to have regular OS updated due to having stock Honeycomb 3.1, the last one came with the dreaded \"narcolepsy\" syndrome.  I.e. it doesn't always wake from sleep without a hard reboot.  This only stared after the second update.  I have no doubt that Toshiba will fix it soon, but till then it is annoying to wait 30-40 seconds while it boots up.UPDATE; I've been using the new update that fixed the narcolepsy.  It did the trick, but unfortunately did not fix other issues.  I'm leaving the rating at 4 stars.ISSUES1. The tablet still wakes itself up for no apparent reason.  Yesterday it was doing it quite often and it drained the battery quite fast.2. I'm having trouble hot swapping SD cards.  I find that I nearly always have to reboot to get it to recognize a card.  I don't have that issue with other Android devices.3. I still have problems with some programs including Market shutting themselves down while other like Flash just stop working altogether.  I'm not sure if that's due to the hardware or just Gingerbread.4. Unlike the Galaxy tab and my LG Android phone, I don't see a way to clear all notifications.  I have to clear each one manually which is annoying.PLUSES1. Videos play even better; I enjoy streaming content to the Thrive!2. I purchased a second battery and it makes it even easier to take anywhere.3. I found that reading email from the Thrive is actually easier than from a computer.

Very productive tablet I'm a college student and this is a very use full tablet can upload PP with the USB port and the expandable memory is great.

I did everything right. Bought the protective cover, NEVER dropped it, and never placed it anywhere that harm would come to it. There are no scratches on this screen. A few weeks ago, one long crack appeared across the screen. This is definitely a defect; not covered by Toshiba. Everyone is having this problem with this product. It is sad and frustrating. A lawyer should gather these complaints together. Toshiba should be made accountable for this defect.My original review:I wanted a tablet, but couldn't afford an IPAD.  This is the next best thing. I am NOT a techie and need to use 'Youtube' to learn any gadget I purchase.  The Thrive is easy to use, works beautiful connecting to any wireless network.I chose the Toshiba brand because I still use their laptop purchased 8 years ago, but works like new.I use the Thrive for E-books, surfing the web, watching movies, and I am still exploring the apps. I also download sheet music to play on my piano.  I chose the size and weight of the Thrive mainly because I am clumsy and this has a grip on the back of the screen that prevents it from slipping from my fingers.

The full size USB and SD slots basically give it 80gb of capacity. (32gb SD + 16gb USB)The only complaint I've really heard is that it's too fat and heavy, but for me, that's a non-issue. It weighs like 1.6 lbs. Are you seriously complaining about the weight of a computer that's less than two pounds? Sure, there are thinner, lighter ones out there, and if that's what you want, by all means, get a Galaxy Tab. They're pretty sexy... but personally, I'll take the bulk if it means I can easily copy anything I want to a USB stick and have it instantly on my tablet... and I can just copy 30gb worth of music onto an SD card and just throw it in..I honestly don't even know how you're supposed to get stuff onto an iPad. iTunes? Really? No thanks.As far as the usability goes - it's flawless. The screen is super responsive. I love reading comics on it. Wifi stays connected well - better than my Acer laptop. The only instability I've seen has been when running non-Honeycomb apps, and you can hardly blame Toshiba for that.

Here're my top ten reasons (not in particular order)1. Full size USB, HDMI, mini USB, SD card for fast and easy access.2. Repaceable battery3. Open most common format documents I throw at.4. Play majority of musical and movies formats (will try .mkv as soon as I have my bigger size of SD card, this would be a plus)5. Decent front and rear cameras (2M/5M)6. The touch and user replaceable of back panel.7. The screen color is very vibrant8. Very responsive and fast execution.9. Fast battery charging (between 75-90min) from initial setup.10. User friendly OS, easy setup and fast app switchingBesides all those I have some cons about this:- Problem waking up from hibernation (fixed in new patch)- No way of killing any individual process / opened app. \"Task manager\" will become longer as you open more apps.  It's fast and good when you're switching between them.- Power plug to tablet is sticking out about 2\". It's in the way in some cases. I think 90 deg. angle type is better.Will update this review as I spend more time with it.  So far I really like what I have.

Two huge long cracks on the center, and a sort of \"spider-web\" impact point crack in one of the corners.  Thought it was a gonner for sure!  After I put it back together (on impact, the back fell off and the battery dropped out), I decided to go ahead and turn it on to see what happens.Amazingly the tablet STILL WORKED!  Even the touch screen!  Other than a bit of an odd feeling when I pass my finger over the cracks on the screen, it works great.I finally got a replacement over Xmas.

At the time I wanted a tablet with a full-size USB and SD Card ports.  So is this tablet bigger than other tablets currently on the market?  You bet.But for that chunky-ness you get a lot of stuff.  Exceptional battery life (and the battery is user replaceable!), full size ports, dual core processor, a fair amount of Toshiba add-on accessories are available for purchase (I got a couple of the HDMI docking bays, as well as a car charger).Also, I abuse the heck out of my electronics, this tablet being no exception.  I use it with no case or screen protector of any kind, and it rattles around in various bags that I carry it around in, but yet it keeps on going strong.  I managed to put a big scrape on the front of it, but it hasn't had an effect on touchscreen at all.  It just keeps going and going.  Currently my favorite case for this is one from Targus, and seems to be designed for big tablets/small laptops, so no banging around any more.My only complaint is that it uses a round connector plug to connect the tablet to an AC power source instead of a micro USB port.  Also, both the home and car chargers for this unit have a big \"brick\" style transformer part in the middle, making it a pain to carry around.Charging time for this tablet is very fast with one of these chargers however.  Once plugged in, the battery takes about 2 hours to a full charge, and the battery life is great once it is finished.Too bad Toshiba stopped carrying these, as I would have loved to see an updated version.", "Date": "March 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "I loved my Toshiba Thrive", "Author": "Michelle411", "ReviewID": "R1ZT5SQ4VCVTWI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the best product on the market as far as purchasing a tablet that DOES NOT fit into the traditional iPad mold.

I had to root it since none of the Android tablets are able to connect to an Ad-hoc wifi hotspot that virtually all mobile phones use to enable their hotspot.  I was fortunate that there was a small community for the Thrive and one of the developers on a Thrive forum I visit had created a ROM that enabled the Thrive to connect to an Ad-hoc hotspot.I had updated the OS to ICS but didn't use the Toshiba Service Station to do so.  I used the ICS ROM supplied by DalePL, the forum member who's Honeycomb ROM I was using.  The ROM is very stable and it made things more fluid. This ROM also allows my Thrive to connect to Ad-hoc hotspots. Also, the Adobe Flash videos that use to stutter in Honeycomb played perfectly under the ICS upgrade.  If anything, the ICS update seems to make better use of the Dual Cores in the Nvidia Tegra chip.The only thing that the ICS update broke on my Thrive was the Bluetooth. I use to be able to connect a Bluetooth speaker and stream music from my NAS, or watch Youtube videos but after the ICS update, the Bluetooth speaker drops out frequently and is unusable.  And you have to use an external speaker since the stereo speakers are worthless and you need bionic ears to be able to hear anything out of them.The Bluetooth issue was a MAJOR bummer for me since it's useless now and I hate having to use a wired speaker. I'm going to solve my Bluetooth issue by buying a Bluetooth transmitter that plugs into the headphone jack.  My Thrive would have something hanging off of it but at least it'll be wireless, sorta.I still love the Thrive since it's the only Tablet to this day that has a removable battery, and I have 3 of them.  You get about 6 hours of solid use out of one charge so 3 batts give me about 18 hours of unwired use.  Also, since this tablet has a full size USB port, you don't need to carry around an adapter to plug in a flash drive or usb keyboard/mouse dongle.  The full size HDMI port is nice but I rarely use it since I'm able to stream most of the videos from my Thrive to my Western Digital TV Live Plus.I would still recommend this tablet even though there are newer, more powerful tablets on the market but only to the geek type person that could live with it's niggles.Just make sure you could return the thing if you don't like it.", "Date": "November 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Loved it until it DIED after 16 months!!!", "Author": "Elizabeth D.

But after finally getting my hands on the Thrive, my first Android tablet, I must say I like this even better.  To be sure, this is not light--especially with a protective case, but it is still lighter than my W500. What's more, the battery lasts much longer. My Acer lasts no more than 5 hours, but my Thrive lasts nearly 7 hours with continuous usage--web surfing, launching applications, ebook reading and watching Youtube, etc, with  20% brightness.  And with Juicedefender Ultimate, I could squeeze 9 hours on one full charge. Now that there are already so many apps available on the Android platform, the Thrive can do a lot of what I can do on my W500--and even more in other aspects.  (I use it as an ebook reader and a notetaker, for some word processing and watching movies.)  And needless to mention, the battery is easily replaceable.The Thrive is not perfect though.  The cameras aren't that good.  And the sound quality can't be compared to that of W500, which is by the way, terrific.

Those are some of the main reasons I was interested in this tablet.  Another biggie for me is that it has a user replaceable battery!  I plan to keep it for a LONG time.  It has GREAT battery life.  While it is a tad bit thicker than other tablets, it's very easy to hold and has a rubberized back for added comfort and grip.  For the trade-off I get all those connectivity features, so for me, it's definitely worth it.  The picture quality is great and works well with Kindle reading, game playing, email, etc.  The file manager is very easy to understand and similar to what you would find on a PC.  I'm not what you would call tech savvy, but haven't had any problems with moving files around.  The only con I can think of is that while the camera works well under good light conditions, it would have been nice to have an LED flash for night and indoors.  All in all, I would DEFINITELY recommend it!!  I would like to add that I have not opened the Kaspersky Tablet Security.  My research indicates that it is just a trial version and when the 30 days are up it will nag you to death.  It cannot be deleted, uninstalled, or de-activated.

I tried to put some mp4 movies on it from my laptop but they wouldn't run. I found a program called Foxreal that converts movies to a different format.I purchased the program (about $30) and converted the movies I wanted to put on my thrive. Now my movies run great and it was much cheaper than trying to replace all of my movies for the tablet. I really like having the expansion ports. They work great to move data to and from my thrive. Ports are for transfer only. I like the way I can hook my thrive up to my labtop with the USB cable and move data back and forth using windows explorer. The thrive connects just like it is another drive. Still learning how to use the google system but it is working well. As soon as you connect to the thrive (after charging) it will take you through several steps. Be sure to upgrade it really helps to have the latest updates. I looked at just about every tablet I could lay my hands on and finally pulled the trigger on the thrive when I saw the price drop, and I am so happy I did. I don't see how you can go wrong unless you feel the little bit of extra weight is a problem.

I've had mine for about 3 months and I rarely use my laptop computer anymore as a result.  I never take the laptop on business trips because the Thrive is a superior presentation tool.  Good battery life, good storage, excellent screen and very solid feeling in every respect.  It's a bit heavy, but again, solid and seems to exude quality all over.The good: Having owned a number of Android devices, including a couple of tablets like the Kindle Fire, I can say from experience that this is far superior.The screen movements, including zooming and selective taps, are very good and do exactly what's expected.Full HDMI is something I didn't think I'd care about until I started using it on the TV and really love it - except... (see below).  We have Logitech Revue Google-TV (also a great product) on one of our sets and the Thrive lets any set have almost all of these features.  YouTube, Netflix, etc. all work great - but not HBO/Cinemax.  I saved a bunch of money and ended up with a much more flexible solution when I went TV shopping by buying a TV without Internet connectivity.  Most TVs have extremely limited application compatibility, where the Thrive (and Revue) give you pretty much everything on the Internet.Speed and screen crispness, both excellent.  I use mine often as a Kindle reader and love it for that, especially in low-lighting situations where the unlit real Kindle doesn't work well.Good and bad:Skype: usually works OK but prone to freezing the image on recipient's end.  Forums indicate this is a pretty common problem.  It usually works OK for me.  Forums also indicate that other services work better than Skype with the Thrive.Camera quality is pretty good with good lighting, but seldom used; why would you use a 10-inch tablet to take a picture?  In my view, they could have left the away-facing camera off.The bad:A bit heavy as a Kindle reader, but still lighter than a hardcover book.  The high resolution crisp lit screen offsets most negatives, especially in low-light situations (like at night in an airplane), but it falls hard on its face in sunlit situations.The on/off button is clumsy and, especially when in a case, difficult to find and operate.There's a screen rotation lock button that can be frustrating, although it's easier than using settings once you know about it and remember that it's there.  Look at forums to view all the \"why doesn't my Thrive screen rotate anymore?\" comments.  I call this button stupid because it is unattached to the Settings menu for auto-rotate - doesn't indicate position or have ability to override the button.  The feature is useful, but there should be some indication of operational state.  I use this feature especially when laying the device flat on a table or when handing it around during presentations.  It's also useful for those times when a picture is rotated, because it allows simply rotating the Thrive to correct the image, which is not true when in auto-rotate mode.Thrive can NOT be used for HBOGO or MAXGO.  I don't know if this is Honeycomb related or Thrive.  Having the HDMI port and such a good streaming device but not for HBO/Cinemax is a limitation I don't like since I spend a lot of time in airports wishing I had access to entertainment I'm already subscribed to.  Hopefully this is a short-term problem that HBO, Google or Toshiba will take care of.Worst is that the Bluetooth doesn't sync to my phone, or any of 4 different phones I've tried.  Message indicates \"Paired but not Connected, and won't go past this point.  Again, many complaints on the forums about this.  Why is this so bad?  I already mentioned that the Thrive is an excellent streaming device for connecting via HDMI.  Aside from music streaming and other wireless transfers, the Bluetooth would permit the cellphone to act as a remote control.  This means the Thrive could stay connected to the TV and be operated by smartphone.  I'm planning to purchase a Bluetooth keyboard/mouse (like the Revue has) and hopefully this will properly pair.  Today, I have to get up to change anything because I don't want to buy a long HDMI cable to drag across the room to viewing position and risk it being tripped over and cause the Thrive to bounce across the floor.  I haven't received a satisfactory reply from Toshiba on this issue because, despite providing this otherwise great product, they are really a lousy company when it comes to customer support.In the end, I wouldn't think of exchanging my Thrive and recommend it highly for all the things it does do so well.

Unfortunately, my 3 year old laptop was starting to need a bit of replacement - the battery was going, the video card was bugging out and lets not even mention the sticking keys... So it was shopping time...I began the search with low end laptops for blogging and basic web marketing - which lead me to machines with far less power than what I had. So, I started using my Android powered phone more for the blogging end and found that it worked quite well. I shifted my search from a new laptop to an Android tablet and the Thrive was one of the last I considered.With the super-light Motorola Xoom, the Samsung Galaxy Tab, the powerful Asus Transformer and the Acer Iconia all in the early running, they all seemed like the better options for one reason or another.

It is heftier than most other 10.1 inchers out there, and i never feel like it's going to break. It's withstood a drop from 4 feet off the ground with no visible markings and no hardware malfunctioning. The combination of full and micro sized USB ports and full-size HDMI port make it the single most versatile piece of technology I own, which is saying a lot. I do a lot of work with digital camera and videographic equipment and the ability to interchange SD cards has proved invaluable. I find myself capturing HD footage or images with a DSLR or some other handheld device and with a split-second removal of the SD card it can be mounted in the THRIVE which can then be used as a widescreen viewer of a whole slew of file formats in real time.On the negative side, as previously mentioned, it is heavier than one might guess for a tablet. It's no ipad and it's no samsung tab in terms of girth and weight, but in functional comparison I feel like I'm going to snap those other two tablets across my knee when their loading times are slower than I'd expect for a next gen piece of tech. BUT, with how much I use the THRIVE on a daily basis (6-10 hours depending on my work load) the weight bearing down on my wrists has pushed me to pay a lot more attention to the waning strength and stamina in my forearms and hands. I've had the THRIVE for about a month now and I can already feel it \"getting lighter\" after so much time spent with it. But in the beginning the weight was very noticeable.I also experienced a problem with the THRIVE freezing up when it would hibernate during the first few days I had it. At the time I was in the middle of changing broadband providers and after a little forum perusing I found other people had had this problem too and most thought it was related to wifi circumstances. I changed the settings to hibernate the THRIVE after 30 minutes of on time and that seemed to alleviate the problem. I never actually let the 30 minutes expire, I just push the sleep/power button on the side to put it to sleep, but it was kind of a pain to figure it out in the first place, though i haven't had a single problem since.All in all, if you're looking for a solid, reliable, versatile tablet, it doesn't get any better than the THRIVE. Other tablets offer varying features in one form or another, but if you are one who prioritizes the functionality of your new tech purchases, not the appearance or status of owning an Apple product or some other product that's highly marketed, there is no better tablet than the THRIVE.

Storage options are so easy you don't need to go the full 32 gig, but I was a little uncomfortable with just 8 gigs.  I also bought the sleeve case, the screen protector and the stylus.  The sleeve case is fine, unlike some I had no problem applying the screen protector, and the stylus is a must.  Fingers work fine but often hit the wrong spot.Battery life has proven to be very good (eight hours or so) and the included software is decent (some of which you may want to delete).  There is a slight lag when using the onscreen keyboard, but we're talking about a 1 gig operating system and 1 gig of memory.  This isn't your souped up laptop in a smaller package (yet), but does fine if you don't want to haul around the full lap top.  It goes where you need to go and is much more easily transported.The Android system is getting there.  It's not quite ready for prime time, but it works reasonably well and I would have to believe it improves greatly over time.  Available apps at this point in time are limited and some of them get horrible reviews.  Apple and Microshaft had their start up problems too.The quality of the video is very acceptable.  It easily plays high quality video from MSNBC and other similar sites.  The full size USB and HDMI ports are nice, and an acceptable reason for the thickness of the Thrive.  It also feels very good and solid in my rather large hands, offers the option of different colored backs, and here's the biggie, an easily field replaceable battery.  Batteries are around $70 and easily replaced for an almost unlimited amount of time using the device if you keep a couple of extra ones charged.Here's where it absolutely falls on it's face.  No one expects miniature speakers to sound good, and these are fine for what they are, but you do expect to plug in a set of phones or earbuds and get some satisfaction.  Not so with the Thrive.  There is no power at the earbud/headphone jack, meaning you can't get enough volume for satisfactory audio levels.  I have very good hearing, and it's really, really bad.  In a noisy airport environment you won't be able to hear whatever you're watching.  I'm going to get around that with an inline headphone amp, but this is absolutely the worst feature of this otherwise very nice tablet.  How Toshiba screwed this up is beyond me, but it is what it is.Using a thumb drive requires that you reformat it in ex(FAT) before it will work with the thrive, but I did that on my laptop last night, then downloaded an MPEG4 movie to it and it plays fine.  There are several little things like this you have to work around while Android evolves.In all, I like my little Toshiba Thrive.  I wish I didn't have to have an outboard amp for my earbuds, but right now that's about the only thing I would really complain about.  It's very user friendly, easy to customize and it travels well.  I bought it on Amazon for $399.  I bet it's down to $100 by next year, if it's even still in production, but I can use it as is and hopefully enjoy it for a couple of years before the 50 gig, quad pro devices show up for $300.UPDATE:  I received a Boostaroo headphone amp today and the volume problem is solved.  I'm using Sony MDR-NC22 earbuds with an impedance of 20 ohms power on and 8.5 ohms power off, so it isn't a high impedance issue, it's a problem with the Thrive power output at the headphone jack.

You get a full-size USB port, mini-usb port, full-size SD card slot & full-size HDMI port. The HD dock gives you two more USB ports and one HDMI port, so you could plug a mouse, keyboard and hard drive into the Thrive at the same time and theoretically drive content to two monitors. Toshiba has included a file manager, so that when you plug in your external hard drive, you will be able to view all of your files in a very easy to read interface. There is also support for MS Office documents and the usual productivity apps from the Marketplace as well. Not only that, but Toshiba has included a full-functioning media player that supports Windows Media files, either audio or video. This means that you will not need to convert files for playback on the Thrive from your Windows PC. This is the only Android tablet that does this, until the Lenovo Thinkpad hits the market on Tuesday.With the Thrive and upcoming Thinkpad, you can actually be productive on a tablet and these are the only two examples of Android tablets that you can say that about. The only bummer here is that for some reason, the Honeycomb Netflix app does not yet support streaming on the Thrive, but I'm sure it will be coming shortly. I would only recommend this device for office use, as it's value is best served in the workplace.

On top of that my wife has stated she no longer wanted a tablet, as she couldn't see a use for it.  I almost returned it, but decided she could do so if she really didn't want it.Those fears were unfounded.  As soon as she got it she was overjoyed.

Don't need full Word, but something just a bit better that a plain text editor.  One can get to the desktop\" version of GDocs however through the browser that comes with the Thrive, it wont let you input any text or really format the text that you have already input in mobile mode.  I suppose that Google is working on fixes for these shortcomings.

Tucking a tablet under your arm on a trip is like heaven.

Compared to perfection, I just give it 4.Everyone should know the unique advantages of the TT by now, so I'll just discuss some often mentioned issues:1. Bug related to the sleep mode. I bought an Archos 70-250G in January. It had the same problem and I just didn't use the sleep mode. Never missed it. Still don't use it even though Archos recently fixed the problem. I expect Toshiba will fix it soon, but I wouldn't consider it a deal breaker if they didn't. Also, some people are reporting that an app named \"Wifi Timeout\" solves the problem.2. Screen brightness. Some people claim a couple of other tablets are brighter. If this is a critical issue for you, go to a real store and compare them. It is brighter than my Archos, which I never used at full brightness anyway, nor do I use TT at full brightness -- that's just TOO bright for my purposes, plus it runs down the battery faster (on ANY tablet).3. Size & weight. The difference between the TT and other top tablets is fractions of an inch and a few ounces. I've walked an hour (on a track) holding the TT up reading a book, and that was in the portfolio case that some people complain adds MORE bulk and weight.4. Battery life. The Thrive is the ONLY tablet for which battery life should not be an issue because it's the only one which allows swapping batteries.One disappointment I did have with the TT is that a USB-powered portable hard drive that I got to use with it is recognized by the Thrive and I can play movies and music from it, but only one at a time because the stock media player will not display a list of media from the external drive. I've also had a problem with the media player pausing during playback from the hard drive, but I've been told by someone with the same drive that he doesn't have this problem.All that said, if I had to give up one of my tablets, I would keep the 7\" Archos. My top priority was using it as a media player. For that purpose, its internal 250GB hard drive and small size make it a clear winner for my needs, not that I don't really like the Thrive. Archos is coming out with new models of their tablets (7\" and 10\" with internal hard drive options) in September and they should give other tablets a run for their money. The Galaxy Tab, the Iconia, and the Transformer are also excellent tablets, depending on your needs. I don't think that you could go wrong with any of these.It should be noted that a screen protector is not really needed for the Thrive, especially if you keep it in a portfolio type case.

It cost $179 more than the g-tab does now but only $50 more than what I paid when it was a new release. In my opinion the extra features are well worth the price difference and it works beautifully right out of the box. The Thrive is about the same size as the g-tab, maybe 1/16\" thicker and about the same weight. I don't see what all the fuss over it's size is all about.

A check of the forums showed that a few other people had this problem as well.  After calling Toshiba and doing number of factory resets, they determined it was a hardware issue.I paid $25 for their fancy box to send it back to them, and tracking the package online, it was literally sent back to me within a few hours of them receiving it.  A few weeks later, the problem came back.  I have to wonder if they actually did any repairs on the unit at all.  After receiving it, I had 24 hours to report any problems, and that time is long gone, as is my warranty.It was a great tablet with its HDMI out, USB ports, SD card slot, but now I have a nice $400 doorstop (it'll go great with my two X-Boxes).

The file access to internal memory and full size sd card is easy but a little disorganized, but once you figure out the OS (esp the long click) it becomes much better. The same can be said about the full size usb slot. The keyboard is well laid out, one of the better of the Android devices I've seen, and it has Swype tech that works quite well. It is as fast, maybe faster, than the other devices that I looked at at the time of purchase and the docking stand is a worthwhile addition for charging, viewing, storage and many other reasons.The complaint about having to reboot after sleep seems to have been fixed in an ota update. It hasn't happened to me. Other than that, the rubber back gives excellent grip making it extremely easy to handle, though I've put a skin over the whole case from Gellaskin.com which, despite the ribbed back, looks great and stays on.Another complaint I've heard about is about the size. This for me is probably the biggest feature of this tab. When my kid dropped it after after getting over excited about some game he was playing, I was able to open the back and reseat the battery pack! That alone justified choosing this device over the other slicker \"looking\" sealed devices.The cameras work fine and the video is satisfactory, but I don't tend to use them much. It also works fine with Skype, though you have to hold the tab extremely still or the image blurs. I don't know if this is due to the device, limitations of Skype, bandwidth, or some combo of all three, but adds another reason to have the stand.The only real drawback for me is the old school power chord. It looks like overstock from an old laptop. A little disappointing (again,a reason for the stand; I can hide the chord but still easily charge the tab). Another minor complaint is the little led's. They are a little bright and can be distracting, but I've gotten used to them now, so, meh... If they really bothered me I could always cover 'em up.The only other complaints I have are with Android, and thus have nothing to do with the device itself.

This revised rating is based on the device and my experience with the retailer (Luvitall07). After several emails, I discovered that this device was refurbished and advertised as \"new\".  The retailer would not replace the device or return my money. What added to my disappointment was that Amazon would not get involved.  My learned lesson is for future purchases go to Best Buy or another retailer.

Mostly.Despite its bulk, there's something about having some heft to it that makes the thing feel more solid. Granted it can make your arms ache after a while of holding but it doesn't feel like it'll snap in half if I hold it too hard either. That 32GB of internal space (the model I got) helps quite a bit, though I'd recommend getting a large SD card to match as well; you're going to fill it up quickly if you play games or download movies on it like I do. Between a laptop and this, it was a close call, but the Thrive won out on the grounds of portability and the fact that the battery can last for half a day at a time if you don't do a lot of web surfing/video watching on it.Only things keeping it from perfect 5/5 are:1) I didn't root right off the bat. Feel stupid for upgrading immediately, as that blocks out a lot of stuff I could do and use otherwise. Still love it to death; just a bit saddened that companies feel the need to block off so much access just because they can - especially since Toshiba doesn't really support the Thrive anymore :< 2) Needs better HDMI-OUT support. Looks blocky and pixelated when I hook it up to the TV.3) Stock browser is absolute bollocks. Minor complaint, really, as there are workarounds that are easy enough to get hold of.and 4) Seems to lag horribly and/or crash with some videos (basically any video site that's NOT YouTube). That might be related to me not getting it rooted, but whatever. I can deal with it.NOTE: Don't be a dunce like me and just upgrade the firmware immediately; take time and figure out how to root (opening access to the \"Super\" account, basically the equivalent of a Windows Admin account) your Thrive. A lot of things require root access, and unless you want to have a lot of heartache that your little Thrive isn't pushing up to speed, get it rooted ASAP!!", "Date": "July 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Two-Year Life Span!", "Author": "Cully Dale", "ReviewID": "R1947APCH0X7QN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "What a nightmare! I bought this tablet two years ago (almost). It's always been a little quirky - I've just attributed the spontaneous turn-ons and -offs as mild annoyances, along with spontaneous reboots in the middle of things. It happened rarely, and the turn-ons seemed to happen only when it was plugged in. However, I now have the problem that the tablet will not turn on AT ALL. After an extremely frustrating round of calls with Toshiba support, during which they were utterly non-helpful, I have ordered a new battery. If that doesn't fix it, I'll trash it and get an IPad. The other Toshiba computers (laptops) I've had have been seriously sturdy, and I prefer Android. However, after Googling around on this issue today, I see that Toshiba knows it has a problem, and has disseminated an ineffective \"fix.\" So, screw me, I'm out of warranty - there's nothing they can do for me.

I agree with some that the Toshiba-installed apps aren't the best, but I've been using Android for over a year and I knew what I wanted, Aldiko for books, ACV for comics, Documents to Go for Office files, and Dropbox for ease of installation.  The standard gallery app is working for my pictures and most videos, but I have a few AVIs that I'm going to have to view through something else.  Since Android Market is available on this version, it's no problem finding apps.When I first received the tablet I went immediately to the Service Station app and installed all available upgrades, including one that was an Android version upgrade.  I don't know if this is the cause, but I've never had the sleep issue.I like the rubbery back.  When you're holding an expensive appliance, everthing that increases confidence in holding it counts.  Having said that, I keep it in a case most of the time.The tablet supports SDXC cards, so I bought a 64gb card from Woot and have it almost full.  My document library and picture library are completely installed there.  The only thing that's not there is the book library because Aldiko won't use an external SD card in many installations, but with 16gb internal it's not an issue.The only negative is that I'd agree with several that the volume just isn't there when playing music.  I've gone into settings for multimedia and set the volume boost on, but even with headphones, it just isn't what I'm accustomed to.

Been using it all day and its still got plenty of battery life. Its super easy to connect to everything if you use Google calendar, docs, gmail and contacts. Only took a few days to learn all the functions and load it up with great, useful and mostly free apps. The standard android keyboard has been suprisingly easy to adapt to and better than one that I added and then uninstalled. Hooked it up to a 42 inch plasma for a class I teach and it looked good (not great). Added a 32gb SD card for storage with thousands of photos (I'm a photographer) and still have tons of headroom.As a photographer I was blown away by two apps: pixlr-o-matic which transforms images with beautiful layers of texture, color and light. All for free. The other great app is dslr controller which turns the tablet into a live view remote controller for my canon 5d through the USB. Crazy cool and useful.The only reason I give it 4 stars is not really a problem with the tablet but with android app availability.... I am also a musician and was hoping to be able to use this for some music creation (keyboard, drum machine, etc)  and there very few good apps for this so far. Hopefully there will be more.If you're  PC Googler, don't even think about the iPad.

What makes it stand out is the myriad of connection options it offers - USB, full-size SD, etc. Some people have complained about the fact that it is nearly double the thickness of an iPad 2, Asus Transformer, Samsung Galaxy, etc., but I find that its thickness to be welcome, as it makes it easier to hold. It is a smidgen on the heavy side, but again, this is relatively unnoticeable in everyday situations.Pros:- A huge array of input options, including full-sized USB, micro USB, full-sized HDMI, and full-sized SD card slot. The full-size SD slot is SDXC-compatible (right now I have a 64 GB SDXC inserted and it's wonderful!).- Standard power jack. Also, comes with a long power cord, about 10 feet long.- Non-slip back cover, great for those with butterfingers (like me).- User-replaceable battery (however, the battery-life is relatively short).- Microphone works well (I list this as a pro because one of the other tablets I had, the Asus Transformer, had a nearly unusable microphone).- Physical rotation-lock switch.- Haptic: Provides vibration capabilities.- Low power consumption in standby mode (left it on all night and lost only about two percent).Cons:- Power, volume, and screen-rotation lock switch are somewhat difficult to manipulate because they are small and stiff to the touch. The power switch is especially stiff.- The camera is mounted in the middle of the one of the short sides. This means, in video chats you will be slightly off-center. Also, it's easy inadvertently touch the camera lens cover.- Lights indicating power, battery charging, and wifi on the bezel are sometimes distracting, especially when watching movies.- Relatively short battery life due its small battery.", "Date": "December 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "W O W !!!!", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Texas Quilter\"", "ReviewID": "R1TW4Q44TZU7YY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Toshiba tablet is the best, bought his and hers for Christmas, tablet offers such a variety of activities, we are definitely enjoying using this Toshiba tablet.

The only thing that would prevent my next purchase from being an Apple is if Windows 8 tablets offer a full experience with Microsoft Office. The single most important thing for me is having full-functioning Excel at my fingertips..No tablet has that, but one that offers full Excel functionality along with the flexibility of a mouse will get my next purchase. So does that mean I should buy an ultrabook? Maybe. Or will Microsoft make the current tablet software market irrelevant by offering full functionality of windows with all the best features of a tablet?

My second mistake was taking another reviewer's advice and downloading the upgrade that was recommended 'right off the bat'. The upgrade changed just about eveything that I had gotten accustomed to in the first few days...it was very frustrating! But the MOST frustrating problem I have now is trying to stream The Daily Show on it, while upstairs, no more than 8ft above the router. It happily plays the commercials but will NOT play the content. I have taken it downstairs and sat right next to the router and still no stream!! I've gone past the time for returning it, so I guess I now have a $350 paper weight! (or \"expensive\" external storage device) I 'was' high on Toshiba electronics because I have one of their laptops and it works great, but this aggrevation with the tablet and some serious problems with one of their 32 in LCD tv's has left a very sour taste in my mouth for Toshiba (except this laptop).

After not using the thing for a couple of days I finally decided to turn it on only to find out that it would not come out of it's sleep state, (did a bit of research online and found out it's common problem with a lot of Thrive owners), so I had to take the battery out; leave it alone for 5 minutes and put it back in.

I have also though to use it as ebookreader for special cases (primarily PDF magazines, or handbooks). Now, I am still in the discovery state. But, it is difficult to tell some new issues about a one year model This is a refurbished, 32 GB model, and this is better than expected because of the write only external SDcard. I also bought some accessories: USB network adapter (Plugable USB 2.0 to 10/100 Fast Ethernet LAN Network RJ45 Adapter (ASIX AX88772 chipset)), Moko holder, some cheap pens, and a screen protector. The tablet works as expected, but it has some serious weaknesses. The battery life should be longer, now 4-5 hrs seems to be not the maximum. Difficult to find the switch on in dark. The USB slots and power slot could be better on the side and not the bottom (portrait mode). As an ebookreader it is not a good choice. I usually go to sleep in 15 mins of reading due to the lcd screen. Multimedia works nicely, even the quality of speakers is acceptable. The touchscreen works well with fingers. With pens there are challenges, but that might be rather a sw issue than the tablet, because some programs uses it smoothly, some others not. The G sensor works nicely, which is particularly important when USB network connection is used. The camera function is a joke. If you want to use the full resolution you have to pay for it! And, it is strange that message is hidden now (because of no other option, I would pay for it). GPS works nicely, although the voice direction could be better. Some linux options (like console, ssh, etc., at least on a non rooted machine) are not really working, but I do not know this is how much tablet specific and how much android. The registering of tablet icon is useless. It is a one time activity, but link (icon) removal is not obvious. The four screens seem to me not enough and perhaps user created extra pages would be useful to avoid the very crowded screens. There is no free office suite (I know that it is not this tablet related). This is a real problem, because sometimes it would be nice to correct something (presentation or doc). The nonfree programs do not worth the price at all (none of them!, based on the trial versions). I have tried the bloated one also (read only mode is free) but that is worse than a bad joke, I surely will not buy it. Free apps for taking notes (as pictures) are nice and easy to write by hands. The virtual keyboard is less convenient. It is difficult fond a good PDF reader too. It is necessary to mention some Toshiba related issues. Fortunately, I have not needed to contact with the customer support, so it increases positive points. But, there are issues what are reducing the satisfaction. It is full with bloatwares. Without rooting they cannot be removed. The SD card is mounted as read only. And still Honeycomb and not ICS! These are very disturbing. I cannot believe that at Toshiba only so bad sw developers are working, who have not been able to port ICS for almost a year. And now it is still a promise only. But, it might happen that that some stupid managers are in the background, and for them the selling is more important than the users satisfaction.  The Toshiba market is strange and probably useless. I could not deduce its purpose. The only free program what I downloaded as test, does not run. Because of the irresponsiveness of Toshiba for software versions I do not expect more from the nonfree programs, too. Accessories: The USB network adapter is nice, although there are places to improve it. It is recommended for everybody for the case of  non wifi network. Moko holder is worse than expected and described by users. It seems to me that is a little undersized by 1-2 mm. Without alternatives, it is recommmended to  buy the cheapest one. I did not expect too much from the pens (not Toshiba, < 2 USD), but those are at least completely filled. Some sws are well working with them, some others not completely, but as a pointing device it is OK, writing fingers seems to be better. Although, I ordered and received a screen protector too, I have not mounted it. First I want to get experiences as is. Finally, the screen is from glass, and normal use cannot cause damages. Briefly, I am  very happy to have this tablet, and I do hope the problems mentioned by others will not appear.

I actually bought the acer w500 and like it as a win 7 pc with touch.First impression is, it's thick, but holding it in hand isn't so bad--slightly heavier than ipad but bearable.  ipad's size & weight has reached a point that it's really comfortable to hold by one or two hands; it feels nimble.The OS is very nice, definitely got a better and more usable UI than ipad.  However this is subjective and depends on who is using it.  Setup is easy and wifi works well. The integration with all of google is very nice.  Cameras are better than ipad.On its own, the thrive looks ok, nothing exciting, but next to ipad, without considering anything else, I could imagine people would pick the ipad, which has a more polished look.  While the thrive's plastic back isn't nice looking, the texture actually feels better, but the texture also makes it harder to clean.  The cover & battery are easy to remove.So -1 for size & weight but +1 for expand options & removable battery.  I am indifferent about the look.However, while it's ok to skim on the look, toshiba really failed to pay attention to some details.  For a tablet this thick, they really should have larger power and volume buttons, especially since that power button is also for waking it up.  You have to feel a bit to find the power button, and sometimes you could hit the power while going for the volume since they are so close.  I would really like a large wake up button in the front.  These buttons on ipad 2 are way better as far as usability goes.  When you also consider the screen that is a finger print magnet, I think toshiba has some improvements to work on.  -1 here.There have been a few wtf moments since I got this.  The first about 30 minutes after I got it.  Set it down, got a drink, picked it back up, fumbled for the tiny power button, and nothing.  It's not waking up, so had to hold it to power cycle, and this would turn out to be a recurring chore.  -1 here.More surprises are to come though.  Set it down for longer, and I witnessed its first self power cycling, and the many more after.  Are they joking?  -1 here.Battery life is ok, definitely not as long as ipad 2.  However my next wtf moment is the next morning after I set it down with more than 50% battery left.  It ended up with 5%.  So it lost 40% battery in 9 hours?  I tested it again.  Left it with 100% and found it at 55% later.  This may have something to do with the sleeping problem but no way to find out.  -1 here.So as it stands, this is a 1 star product.Overall, if not for the wake up and power cycle issue, this is a nice tablet and a keeper.  Some details could be improved, especially the tiny power/wake up button, which was almost a deal breaker for me, so it's probably a 3 or 3.5.  However the power cycling was just too much.  I know they are working on a software fix, if it's problem with that, but I was not going to risk keeping a defective product, so it went back to amazon.", "Date": "July 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not the Best Tablet", "Author": "LiLEri", "ReviewID": "R2G7YF0E71WM2M", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I really wanted & expected to like this tablet but it didn't make it easy.First was the display. It isn't as clear as other tablets I own & this bugs me everytime I use it. It seems washed out like it needs a lot more contrast, especially on white screens or webpages (which is pretty much everything almost). I wish it was sharper.It seemed slow right from the start, even though its the largest one (32gb) & I added an additional 8gb sd card. Every browser I tried on it seemed to choke and pdf files would never fully load. So this meant I could never fully load the user manual on this device. Other apps loaded ok, not great but tolerable.The sound quality is so-so & at first extremely low until I figured out that I needed to uncheck the \"default\" setting under \"multimedia\" & move sliders up to increase volume (default setting are only set to about 25%). This increased volume but does not improve quality.The video is hit or miss for me.,,,,sometimes it works & sometimes not and with the not so great display, it just makes it worse.There is no Netflix either or Hulu but Hulu isnt technically available on any mobile devices.As for some positive things,It came with a few good things like a Printer app, which should be on all tablets. It prints from wifi and other printers which is great.There is an antivirus app but I think its a trial, still good though. It has Honeycomb but does not have an update for latest yet.Also, they included a pretty good file manager app which makes file transfers easier.The ports are a nice plus. I love the full size USB port for external drives.All in all, its a decent tablet. Maybe I'm expecting too much but I can't return it, only exchange so I might get used to it,I don't mind the look of it either. Its a little thicker than others but it doesn't bug me.

C. \"graphic artist\"", "ReviewID": "R33GAY2PG2YRCY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "(written using my toshiba thrive)I've been using this tablet for 3 months now and it's great for me:OS: the update to ICS is available now and easy to download from Toshiba service station. It is speedy and easy to use and with the bugs still showing on jelly bean, and this version is perfect for me.SCREEN: very responsive, and although not the best out there it has good viewing angles and resolution. I use this as a drawing tablet a lot and accuracy is great.MEMORY: this is the strongest point of the tablet - although 16 gb is a lot and ideal for lots of apps, if you want media on here you'll need more. This device accepts REGULAR sd cards and usb sticks, and giving it the versatility of a pc. It also accept sdxc - up to 128gba memory which is more than I can say about most devices. This avoids the need for the extra adapters... The hdmi port is also full sizeDESIGN: Toshiba opted for versatility over beauty here. It is rugged and secure in the hands, but very thick. For some this is an issue, but for me it is a great advantage as I have trouble gripping things so I drop it all the time. In addition, the this is a direct result of my previous point, the full size ports. It is advised in any case to use a case...CAMERA: Not good. No auto focus so pictures don't come out sharp and no flash so unless you're in a perfect lighting situation it won't work. This being said, the 5mp it comes with isn't useful. It does have a front facing camera which works great for Skype.BLOATWARE: this device doesn't come with much unnecessary software - it has some great stripped down versions of the best apps - including need for speed shift and quick office, plus a great file explorer - a lot better than Samsung's. There are too many card games so for those like me it's annoying but since some pay for these, it can be good.SOUND: I'm fine with it, although it's not exactly the best out there it is definitely as expected. Some have complained its a bit low, although since it's easy to plug headphones or a speaker I'm fine with it.PROS:*Durable and easy to grip*easy to accessorize - back cover can be replaced*extra battery can be purchased unlike most tablets*fast, quality device*front and back cameras*5mp back camera*ICS update*biggest: full size ports make it more like a computer*vibrant screenCONS :*Poor photo quality*heavy*low speakers*design is not as cool and modern as othersIN CONCLUSION: this tablet has been perfect for me. I use it heavily for graphic design work, gaming, browsing and shopping, social media, and more. I take it with me every day to work and I am not a strong person. The few flaws have no effect on how I enjoy it and are actually sacrifices that are directly related to advantages that have more weight with me. Accessories are easy to find and inexpensive. I would definitely recommend it.Rated 4 stars: wanted to take off half for the camera but since I can only do whole stars in took off a whole.This is the case I bought to go with it - recommended: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007TXMQJ4/ref=oh_details_o06_s00_i00", "Date": "November 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Toshiba Thrive 10.1-Inch 16 GB Android Tablet AT105-T1016", "Author": "hjaspe", "ReviewID": "R1JDQK8I8P3ZIN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent product, has a high performance, although it comes with Android 3.1, you can upgrade to Android 4.0, the update is automatic.

If I had, I would have learned:1) Although the Toshiba Thrive allows for the insertion of SD cards up to 128GB, you cannot write data to them except through a convoluted process involving the File Manager or using a PC. And even then, you can only write data files to the SD card, not Android program files. Thus, your programs are confined to System RAM, defeating the logical purpose of having an SD card.There are hundreds of complaints about this on various Toshiba forums - and Toshiba has failed to address the question. In other words, Toshiba doesn't give a hoot about customer satisfaction.2) When I got these units from an Amazon subsidiary, the GPS didn't work in either unit. I sent them to Toshiba for warranty repair.The units were \"repaired\". Unless the GPS is literally in the clear, it does not reliably receive signals - which means it is useless in normal situations, such as riding in a car.Again there are hundreds of people complaining about this in various Toshiba forums - and Toshiba hasn't said a word.In short, the Toshiba Thrive is essentially useless if you need more program storage than the internal microSD card provides or need GPS use in situations where the Thrive is not in the open.Other than those two massive failings which Toshiba is apparently doing nothing to rectify, the Thrive is a solid unit.

Harley", "ReviewID": "R15W2MQCM1BUMP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After comparing several Android tablets at a local store, I decided the numerous full-sized ports on the Thrive was too big a feature to overlook.  Thrive didn't have the best looking display (that title goes to the Galaxy tab).  The Thrive's display seems a little washed-out compared to the Galaxy Tab, but it's not a bad display by any means.  In fact, if you didn't have a Tab next to it for comparison, you probably wouldn't even notice. The body is also a little thicker than the other tablets but not ridiculously so.  Besides, I'm not particularly obsessed with getting the thinnest possible tablet.  I'll let the Voss water drinking crowd obsess over aesthetics and thinness, I just want a good performing tablet.  The rubberized back offers great support, something I found lacking when using my iPad without a case.  By the way, this is not an iPad replacement, it's a companion; same way I have an iMac and a PC.  I figure I'll get the best of both worlds and the Thrive definitely delivers on the Android side. The pricing is also aggressive as I paid 99-cents more than the price of a Kindle fire for this during an Amazon Black Friday lightning deal.  Factor in a high-speed 32GB SD card for roughly $38 and I'm rocking a 48GB 10.1 Android tablet for well under $250.  I realize that is special pricing but it does make purchasing this that much sweeter.The Honeycomb Android OS is fast and responsive, although still not quite as fluid as iOS.  There is that occasional lag which I attribute to all Android devices.  Any Android owners willing to be truthful know exactly what I'm referring to. I compared performance  among several Android tablets including the Thrive and tablets from Asus, Samsung, and Lenovo.  The Thrive was just as responsive as the others.  Based on what I've found, I don't think there will be a noticeable gap in performance among Android tablets until the Transformer Prime is released soon.  I also hear the Android Ice Cream Sandwich OS revision is supposed to address a lot of performance issues and make the Android OS smoother. The only question is if it will run on all of the current tablets or if everyone will it require beast tabs like the upcoming quad-core Transformer Prime.  In the meantime, Honeycomb is mostly stable with only the slightest of occasional hiccups and the Thrive functions well with it.  The cameras are standard fare, meaning nothing to write home about.  The front facing is adequate for apps like Skype, Google+ or other videoconferencing needs.  The rear camera takes higher resolution snaps and HD video but I still have no plans to ditch my dedicated digicam or camcorder.  The ports work as advertised.  This feature is AWESOME!!  Toshiba even includes a built-in file manager, so you don't have to buy an app to explore files on external storage or the device itself.  The ports make it much more laptop-like than the other tabs.  Plug in a flash thumb drive and view files, photos, etc.  use a full size HDMI cable to play HD content.  Stream Netflix or anything else via the HDMI to a large screen HD TV.  So far, YouTube, Netflix and video streaming work fine for me on the Thrive.The Thrive has a removable back panel (which can be swapped with optional different color panels) and a replaceable battery.  I don't really go for super-long stretches away from an outlet, so I doubt I'd need a spare battery, however, it's great to know that if battery life suddenly shortens or it doesn't charge properly (as I experienced with my Android phone in the past), I can replace the battery and make it goods as new.The Thrive might not be the thinnest, sexiest, or even most powerful Android tablet, but for the price and the features, it's the best geared toward power users looking for real connectivity options.

I didn't buy it from Amazon, but I did get a return label sent to me from the company that I brought it from, but it was cheaper than an iPad with the $100 Groupon coupon I used.I barely install any apps on it, but it always seems to glitch on me with every factory reset (which I did the 2nd day I had it, and many more since). As of right now I had to install a widget to turn up the volume because even though I'm using the volume rocker, and the slide is moving on the screen, it doesn't want to play my Pandora radio unless I use these extra widgets. I can't have my iPhone plugged in before I take it out of sleep mode or else the screen won't turn on even though the wifi light lights up. That part is good because it stays on so I don't have to worry about it going to sleep and stop charging my phone. This last part only started happening since it upgraded to 4.04.I've never once rooted it because I was worried it would make it even a larger piece of crap. The screen loves to show your fingerprint smudges, the default browser is always and always crashing, you have to format any storage device/card in FAT32 to actually have it write to them.. If I try to skype, I'm happy if it actually lets me use the camera facing me for SKype because on average I have to reboot it in order to use it because it wants to keep using the one on the back, or doesn't work at all. Here are the apps I use on it so you can see I barely even use it and still have all these problems:1. Pandora2. Chrome Browser3. Chive4. Facebook5. Dropbox6. And 5 widgets (3 of which are for the volume problem I mentioned earlier)That's all I use. I have more installed, but nothing major -- mainly Amazon apps that I never use.I wouldn't recommend this tablet to anyone. I have a friend who is an Android fanboy and even he is surprised by how buggy and crappy this tablet is.The end.*drops mic and walks off stage*", "Date": "January 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "personally I like this better than ipad2 or any tablet", "Author": "jessie lacson \"jessie\"", "ReviewID": "R32F2AN3L8R7TG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I won't discuss any technical jargon on comparison to any tablet the main reason I bought this after a long research and spending a lot of time in Best Buy Store doing hands on testing what impress me is the regular size USB,HDMI, Mini USB and full size SD Card Slot. 5 meg rear camera and 2 meg front.The built in speaker is not design to Blast your ear, plus who want to listen to your loud Rap music or any music you luv in the Library or Starbucks , Come on guys be realistic OK .The LED lights doesn't bother me a bit, If it is bother you just put a Black Electrical tape on it, I don't have complain about the whole quality of the product on itself, actually I think is has good quality on it.I order the original case to amazon so I don't have to hold it and I can position it so many different ways. Now, I don't have to removed it to the case any more, plus in case you accidentally drop it,the case will offer more protection. Like any electronics you need to take care of it . It's not designed to be a Frisbee. I installed Zagg protector for $30.00 I thought I mess it up, all the bubbles are gone after 2 days, you can't even tell if its there , Bose Companion 2 Series ll speaker for $100.00 ,I plug it when I'am on my computer desk the sound is amazing you hear every instruments.The Beat Solo HD headset made by monster and endorsed by Dr. Dre is your perfect companion for private listening for Aiport, Plane, Library or Starbucks coffee shop. $200.00 thru Amazon ( On the Plus side if you use this on iphone4 the music pause when somebody is calling, has built in mic and volume control), you got to try it.Personally I think it is better than Bose Q15 $300.00 noise cancelling headset. I will never exchange my thrive for Apple ipad2. Well, if they have all the expansion slot that is a different story.I also have an Apple itouch 32 GB 4th Gen and I just got Apple iphone4 from AT&T; a month ago which I both luv. So, what ever you want to buy its up to you. Do your own research, don't listen to me or any tech head. No user manual, but you can download from Toshiba web site it took me one day to figure how everything work. No problem since I got this a month ago. I hook this once in a while to my Bose 901 Series Speaker and carver amp. Toshiba thrive rock, sound like CD's. So easy to transfer musics or data from main drive to SD card or Thumb Drive or vise versa. Hey, Steve Jobs why don't you give those ports to your customers? Do you scare of something, I heard your company is worth $350 Billion bigger than mobil-Exxon. wow, I wish I have some stocks on Apple. If you install everything like in my Toshiba Thrive I'll give this to my daughter and I will buy the Apple ipad3 in a heart beat..so for now good luck to ipad2 lovers, if you are happy for what tablet you have, fine.. about the weight of the Thrive, perfect for me, I guess If you think it is too heavy, you need to visit the Gym once in a while, instead of going to mickey D. Ha-Ha-Ha .I have 17'' inch HP $950.00 with blue ray player almost 10 lbs. No problem carrying that one too. I'am 60 years old retired military.If you really like a very light tablet stick to your smartphone. This is my easy carry on going to Starbucks or any place where Wi-Fi is available, just don't leave it on your car on summer time it maybe roasted when you comeback, also great for surfing, while on sofa, Deck or bedroom . Well, good luck folks.

I bought my son a Toshiba Thrive for Christmas 2011.  He was just in love. Bought a case: Bought screen protectors: and has taken care of his \"baby\".  I've never seen someone so excited even months later by his toy.  This morning he picked it up and the glass just cracked. I heard it from across the room.  We can not figure out why.  I can only assume that the glass had hairline fractures prior to assembly and over time the stress of the picking up the tablet has caused the glass to stress to the point of fracture.  The cost for a replacement screen and frame assembly $160.00. (NO LABOR)  That's right almost 1/2 the cost of the tablet  WHAT!!!! That says two things:  #1 - Toshiba knew the glass would break and saw a way to make more profit.  #2 -  they won't stand behind the broken screen under their warranty (assumption is that broken glass must be the owner fault).  If you search the internet you will find numerous complaints about the broken screen.  The unit works fine if you want to risk cutting your finger!!!!

I purchased Thrive for $299 with low expectations. I like the iPad,  but so does everyone else in my house. This tablet was supposed to offer an alternative to the iPad  and take on some of the internet browsing traffic from the iPad. Over all I was pleasantly surprised,  I like it more then I thought I would, and I would  buy it again for $299.  I will focus here on shortcomings of the product.  If you are interested in strengths read Toshiba's marketing materials or the 5 star reviews :-).  Here are my general observations starting with the most annoying items:- Cannot charge it using USB port / charger. If you travel you need to drag along another charger with you, and can't use external batteries.- Thrive's screen is a finger print super-magnet compared to the iPad. Not sure if is the material used for screen or the iPads cover cleans the screen as advertised... The screen on Thrive seems to be always 10 times greasier compared to the iPad.- Screen has significant glare which makes the fingerprints more visible and harder  to use in areas with strong light.- While watching videos, the picture quality seems to be lower compared to the iPad. I rented few videos from Google and watched the shows using Netflix on both tablets. The video quality was noticeable better on iPad. It could be because the Video streaming software is not yet optimized for Android tablets.- I was surprised about the few apps designed for tablets on the market.  Most of the apps that I had on my phone downloaded automatically when I setup my Google account, but they appear to be stretched versions of phone apps with the same menu systems and graphics.- Hulu Plus not available yet and Netflix was just made available. Again, Android is behind with software compared to iPad.- Buttons are in the weird locations. The power button is not behind the light that blinks when the tablet sleeps  so I have to look at every time  to find it. In addition, who needs these lights anyway?- Thrive is speedy and responsive but screens lags on occasions especially after you wake it up from sleep. It is more of a cosmetic then functionality issue, but it is there.-  No option to turn off mobile mode in the browser so a lot of websites open in the mobile mode and there is no way to view the full version. This option is on my Android 2.3 phone, so I hope it will be available in future updates.- I need to press an on screen  button to see  pictures in every email sent in html format. This is annoying and I cant find a way to change that behavior.- Battery life is very good but it is not 10 hours. I get through a day with a heavy usage without charging but I think the battery is good for no more than 7 hours.- Spell check/auto correct  is not working consistently in all apps. I am typing this review on Quickoffice on my tablet. If you see spelling mistakes, you know why.- No  way to create desktop folders. You need a third party app. Again this is something already available in Android 2.3 so it is strange it would not be available in 3.2- When using Google and Amazon music players, tablet will go to sleep after X minutes. Only when using Toshibas player, the screen will turn off and the tablet stay on while you listen to music.- No easy software / app to import / export pictures from memory stick or USB drives. iPad requires an adapter but when you buy it, importing and managing pictures is very easy.- No easy printing solution , only 3rd party clunky solutions.- No split screen keyboard included. This is a 10'  16:9 tablet so typing with thumbs is tough in landscape mode. There are good alternatives on the market place put they cost around $3Summary - Android has great potential but it is not yet as polished as the market leader.  Thrive has solid hardware and functionality not found on other tablets like the full size ports and removable battery.  If you are looking  for tablet  to be used mostly with  email and internet, and the issues I listed above will not drive you crazy,  look no further.  However, if selection of apps and the hassle-free operation is what you are looking for, you should wait for the next generation of Android tablets or consider iOS.***************11/23 - UpdateI am adding one star for flexibility that comes with full sized ports. Being able to plug in full sized cards and portable HDs is very handy. I also purchased stand that allows me to plug in a keyboard and a mouse. With that setup, I have a laptop replacement for working on longer emails where virtual keyboard and touch interface is not that convinient yet. The main issues for me are still the screen quality / resolution and a need to use dedicated charger.", "Date": "November 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love the Thribe just not this one", "Author": "SBF making her own choices", "ReviewID": "RWH612Z95Q8QX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had to return this product. the great price was because it was poorly refurbished.

She cant do much but if I wanted I will have to ship the tablet at my expense (25$) to get it repaired. The repair will be free as it is under warranty and if they will not be able to fix it, they will give me more options later. The timing will be about 2 weeks. Really ? Thats the best toshiba can do ? They have my money for a defective product and cant do much but repair and not replace ?

It was also my first tablet experience.When it arrived, I pulled it out of the box, pulled off the plastic from the screen, and put one  GreatShield Ultra Anti-Glare (Matte) Clear Screen Protector Film for Toshiba Thrive 10.1 Touchscreen Tablet (3 Pack) on it.  Thankfully, they came in a three pack, as, I hadn't realized when I was lining it up that it wasn't sticky on my fingers, but it would rapidly meld to the screen.  Strangely, it was centered, but there were bubbles everywhere.  I let that part go so I could turn it on and play.Turned it on and immediately knocked out the software update.  Kaching!  Ready to go!I began collecting apps like potato chips.  Some worked.  Some didn't.  I actually never got the FB app to work properly.  Also, the Android Marketplace lagged quite a bit.  Often, when I thought I'd downloaded an app, it actually never got to the install step.The screen was beautiful.  I admit, I never thought the concept of watching a movie on it was appealing, so I never did.  I don't subscribe to Netflix, and streaming movies eats my bandwidth like nobody's business (Verizon MIFI).The sound wasn't that great.  In fact, the location of the volume control is not in a great place, either.  I found myself turning the sound up instead of powering down the system on several occasions.  But, the sound popped and crackled at points---not enough to be terribly annoying, but enough to notice.  I did not use headphones at any time.I was happily fighting over the Thrive with my husband for a few weeks, resisting the urge to shout, \"Mine!\" when he wouldn't give it back.  He was busy smashing ants and firing birds from a slingshot.  I thought he would break the screen with his hard, end of the finger tap instead of the gentle, pad of the finger touch.  I kept trying to tell him, \"It's a TOUCH screen, honey.\"  Thankfully, it's not a fragile screen, or Mr. Power Poker would have shattered the screen from corner to corner.Within about a week, I decided to replace the screen protector.  I should have left it alone, as, I ended up with more bubbles and dust (what?!) between the protector and the screen.I took a few goofy pictures of myself to use as my FB profile.  The camera on the front ain't too hot.  I decided to use the camera on the back.  I'm not photogenic (or I see myself differently than others do, I guess), but they weren't that hot, either.  The light in my house wasn't wonderful that evening, so I had to blast lights on in order to get a half decent shot.  I wouldn't put a great rating on either front or back camera.I tried Oovee (oovoo?  whatever) with it.  It was okay, but I found the images choppy and strange.  I'll pass on any kind of video calling, I think.I was also able to load the Kindle app.  Unfortunately, I was too distracted by marbles, and word games, and angry birds to read much.  The Thrive is a wonderful time waster, as I assume any tablet is.I got two separate apps to move some of my apps to the SD card.  It seemed neither one of them would work.  A quick lookup on the internet... you can't get there from here.  Nope.  Can't run apps from SD card.  So much for my theory that I was going to 'upgrade' my Thrive with a simple SD card.The battery life wasn't awesome, either.  I changed the brightness settings on the screen and made sure my wifi and GPS were off when not in use, but I still never got more than four hours of use.I hadn't gotten a chance to use the GPS for the first three weeks.  I can't help it if I know where I'm going!  The third week, my darling mother-in-law provided me with a perfect opportunity for mapping and GPS.  She had a doctor's appointment at a doctor's office in new place!  The night before, I carefully used the Google Map app and planned out our route.  It was perfect, with driving directions and everything!  I loaded the map app in the morning, route planned, and headed out the door.  By the time I arrived to pick up my MIL, the app shut down.  I sat out in the car, turning the map back on and turning on GPS.  I finally got the GPS satellites to agree where I was, and the map wouldn't load.  All I had was squares with a little blue icon for my location.  Not much help.So, just before I turned the GPS and the Thrive off in frustration, the right half of the screen went black.  What?!  I turned the Thrive all the way off.When I arrived back home later that morning, I turned the Thrive back on.  It seemed okay.  In fact, it even loaded the stupid map.  I began playing a game of Jewels and forgot all about my earlier troubles with the Thrive.  I almost ignored the phone when it rang, I was having such a good time.  I answered and let my Thrive wait for me.The Thrive went to sleep while I was gone, and when I came back, I could not move the little lock out of the circle no matter how much I tried.  I almost started poking the screen like my husband does smashing ants, but decided to reboot instead.I thought the sleepy screen problem was solved with a Toshiba software update.  Apparently not, because, sleep mode caused another stuck lock.I surfed the internet for solutions to the problem.  I thought I had it solved, but, all the sudden, while in Browser, my screen freaked out.  I had red, blue, and black lines running across the whole screen.Another week of weird glitches like that, and I decided the Thrive was not for me.  I decided to box it up and send it back.  It hadn't been a whole month, and it was already having problems.  I suspect the problems I had were the graphics function, but I don't know.  I couldn't get a replacement from HSN, and I didn't really know if I wanted one.Other things I noticed during my Thrive ownership:  my husband clicked the SD card out, thinking it was the power button.  It's not a covered area.  Just a push/lock.  I loved the Amazon App of the Day.  If you have Android, do not miss this.  The keyboard was a little hard to get used to.  I found myself two finger typing... until I found the preloaded Swype keyboard.  Now that was pretty neat.  I hated the fact that it came with several apps that weren't removable (Kapersky and the office demo).Also, I did a side by side comparison to the Ipad2 with the Thrive.  The Thrive is a little wider, but not much.  It's also not that much heavier.  It's much lighter on the wallet, though. The Ipad2 was a little faster, but we never compared for boot times (my Thrive took longer than my desktop to boot).How does it compare to other Android tabs?  I can't answer that.  I carefully chose the Thrive because of it's extra options that I didn't find in other tablets:  HDMI port, full-size USB, and SD card options.  Turns out I never used anything but the SD card, and that wasn't usable for the apps option.Maybe I got a lemon.  I don't know.  I just didn't feel like hassling with Toshiba over it.BTW, I still have a screen protector left.  I think I'll use it as a dust collector.", "Date": "December 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "My first tablet...okay but wish it could do more", "Author": "ACDC", "ReviewID": "R5F8QB4OOAZ17", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got this as a Christmas present from my wife. I do like all the features (USB, SDcard, bluetooth, etc.) but I still wish this could do more. This is mostly at fault to Google and Android, though, as it is software limitations that are causing me headaches. A few things I'd like to do which seem very difficult to me (and I'm pretty computer savvy):1. Play all of my video files...MPEG, AVI, MOV, etc...I've found some apps that'll do some but not others. Found one app that seemed to work but then wouldn't play the entire video on some! Also, digital movies are pretty much useless on here. I've tried converting them using multiple programs with no luck (always choppy or something corrupt).2. Open office documents easily and be able to create and save Excel, Word, Powerpoint....again, some apps for this but some you have to pay for. Google Drive seems useless to me.3. Would like to access my NAS (server) and music, pictures, etc. that are shared on it...easily! I can use the LG NAS apps to access the data, and that works but I have to download it to the tablet in order to open it. I'd like to be able to stream it directly through the network, like I can do with my laptops...maybe I just haven't found the trick or the app but this seems like rocket science to me and is frustrating.4. Manage my finances using my tablet....right now I have to boot up my laptop when it comes time to pay bills because I currently use Microsoft Money to manage my finances. I know Money is obsolete now and don't expect an app for that, but I looked into switching to Quicken and I don't see any apps for Quicken either...so for now I'm stuck using my laptop every time I have to enter in receipts, etc...which is quite often for me!5. Wish it was powerful enough to run my car's tuning software, but I know it would never be compatible anyway. So, I still have to use my 6 year old laptop for this as well which hooks to my ECU/chip via USB (Moates Quarterhorse using Binary Editor and EEC Analyzer)6. Needs Chrome browser. I would like to be able to integrate my Chrome hyperlinks, etc. with my Tablet. Current Honeycomb browser is terrible and has errors all the time (force closes). I currently use Opera which is more stable but still don't like their bookmark setup.7. Still no sign of ICS (Android 4.0). My new phone has it and it seems nice, though not sure how much better it will make this tablet but I'd still like to have the latest and greatest.For me, this is really only good for browsing the web or it is handy looking stuff up when out working on a car. I put Invisishield on it and got a flip case for it to protect the screen and body and those do a great job.I am in the market for a new laptop, and may wait out for a good Windows 8 tablet that can run my tuning software (with Core i5 or something simlar to the Microsoft Surface) and then I really won't have a use for this anymore. Too bad as I love the potential for Android and love it on my phone for sure, but not sure if they can really keep up with Apple on apps and features for tablets...and with a Windows-based tablet or even ultrabook you can do so much more than either, though you'll likely be paying a premium for that. For me, I still need a laptop for the things mentioned above, so I'd love to integrate both into one unit which soon I may be able to...just not sure if Android will be the base or Windows will be the way to go (more likely).", "Date": "July 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Compare with IPAD?", "Author": "ecmrecordlover \"ecmreh\"", "ReviewID": "R34SPB3EDH1TM2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this model based on reviews.

It instead requires repetitive motion gestures over and over and over to scroll down a long webpage. There must be an easier way that can be implemented, like the way it is possible to easily scroll to certain contacts in the phone book. Don't force users to scroll endlessly through pages.As far as other things, which are less related to the software or hardware...There is still no option to have extensions installed for Chrome. So, no ad-blocking software. That means lots of annoying and distracting ads in your face while you browse. Surely they can enable extensions on tablets. I consider it a deal breaker if I must view ads on a device I paid for. There are other options to eliminate ads, but they require additional options and won't always be available depending on how you connect.In general, a tablet offers convenience, but the software limitations tell me to hold off until they hear our complaints and clean up issues outstanding. Apple is an alternative but doesn't allow for ad blocking yet either, at the device level. And, Apple products have suffocating restrictions on what file types they will play.This device definitely offers an advantage with its multitude of possible connections, but basic features such as voice search should definitely be working.

Usually, one can navigate down the list by lightly touching the page and flicking your finger upward.  However, OCCASIONALLY, even the lightest touch has caused the video parallel to where i touched to start playing RATHER than my being able to navigate down the page to select a different video.  A different but related problem is that sometimes the lightest accidental touch will cause a webpage or app to close, sometimes non-retrievably.  At other times, you have to press or touch several times to get it to do what you want.  The Android 3.0 User Guide has a number of mistakes in it, e.g. where it tells you how you're supposed to delete downloads.

In the interest of full disclosure, I didn't actually \"buy\" this tablet as I won it as a prize in a contest. I currently have the 16GB model of the Thrive.First off, this thing is huge. It's massive. If you haven't touched it before, quick run down to a store and play with it...it's probably a lot larger than you think. I hadn't actually used one before I got mine and I was a bit taken aback by its size.  You're not going to win any beauty contests with this sucker, and it only gets worse when you add a case to it.  That being said, it didn't take long for me to get over its girth.  The battery plate's rubberized texture makes it pretty easy to hold.  And Toshiba's main claim for the girth is the addition of the SD card slot and full sized usb and hdmi ports.  Honestly, the trade in size is well worth not having to carry around separate adapters for hooking up memory cards, usb drives and hdmi cables.  The only place Toshiba misses the mark with regard to ports is the inclusion of a mini usb port instead of a micro usb port.  Not sure why they did this, but I'd much rather have the micro so I could connect more newer devices to it.As of this review, the Thrive has been updated to Android 3.2, but the one you receive may still have the original 3.1 software on it.  I'd suggest going to settings, about, software updates to download any existing updates before you get too involved in playing with this.  Also note that you'll want to do some research if you're big into rooting and custom roms, as there are reports about the latest factory update breaking some of the rooting techniques.Toshiba provides a mostly stock 3.2 experience with some added benefits. The best enhancement is their inclusion of a file manager that allows you to easily browse through the contents of your Thrive, SD card or USB memory stick.  This is so easy, in fact, that if you're price sensitive you could easily consider going with the 8GB or 16 GB versions instead of the 16/32 GBs and buy a SD card to make up the difference in space.  The SD card port and ease of the file manager makes it a breeze for managing media (essentially videos for kids in my case) on the device.The Thrive's cameras are what you'd expect on a tablet: adequate but not amazing. They're not going to replace your point and shoot, and it's a little awkward taking photos holding the tablet, but it's great for capturing a quick pic or using video chat.The HDMI port mirrors your tablet on your TV or other screen.  It's pretty much plug and play, but I've noticed that the picture quality can vary a bit.  However, this feature, combined with the SD card slot, turns the device into the ultimate picture slideshow as you can quickly display pictures on the TV by swapping out the SD card and using the HDMI out on the TV.  Note that if you do this, don't try to browse through the pictures via the file manager.  The Thrive will show all pictures on the SD card as a folder in the gallery, and this is the best place to flip through pictures. In the file manager, you'll have to click on each picture individually instead of viewing a slideshow.The battery on the Thrive is \"so so\" in my opinion.  It's not as great as other tablets out there, but it will still make it a good ways on a charge. The battery is actually replaceable, so you could buy a spare if you really needed one.  Also, the Thrive charges via a proprietary cable that looks a lot like a laptop cable, so you won't be charging this sucker off your computer if you forget your charger.The last thing I'd like to touch on is the Thrive's Android 3.2 software.  As of this review Toshiba has not released any date for an Android 4 (Ice Cream Sandwich) update.  I found the Thrive to lag a bit, especially when using the browser.  It's not the smoothest device out there, but there are definitely worse tablets on the market. An upgrade to Android 4 should improve this device's user experience.  The main drag with this device's software, however, pertains to its start-up/boot time. Be prepared to wait about a minute for it to turn on and be ready for use. That might not seem long, but when you're staring at that screen it feels like an eternity.Overall, I give the thrive a 3/5 rating.  It has its issues with software and size, but also some great advantages with the many useful ports. Its combination of size, boot time and battery life make the Thrive a tough sell as a commuting device as it provides few advantages over a net book or laptop.  But, if you're looking for a couch tablet that has great flexibility in storage/ports/video connectivity, and you're only planning on travelling with it occasionally, it could be the perfect fit for you.", "Date": "January 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "I feel lied to....", "Author": "Barb Lodge", "ReviewID": "R3PKIKUAX8PX6E", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Screen is scratched, cracked.

It \"clicks\" everytime I touch the screen even though I have turned that function off under settings -- also the stylus is too large and hits two items at once -- which causes me to shift my focus to the tablet -- not acceptable.I am pleased with the tablet for what I know and understand of it.", "Date": "December 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent device", "Author": "Oscar Chang Neyra \"Jaime Chang\"", "ReviewID": "R38U8Z1RS26JLV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Toshiba made us wait for a while, but it was worth.

I'll skip the specs part because you can read that below.Arrival:The quick/getting started guide does a nice job of outlining the where all the buttons are. I went ahead and took the back off so I could see how I could change the battery. Very easy to do and there's a cover lock button that makes it all very easy. There's a great wizard that fires up when you first turn it on that walks you through WiFi setup and Google account login. I added all 4 of our family accounts for myself, my wife, and 2 daughters. The Gmail app has real nice quick select option to switch between accounts so we can share the device with ease.Speed:Lightening fast for everything. Screen swiping, apps opening, screen orientation switch, you name it. No lags anywhere which makes it a real joy to use.Apps:I downloaded a few of my favorite apps from the Android Market like Astro, Pandora, Swype (I'm in the Beta program), Angry Birds, Battery Left, and so on. No issues whatsoever. I do know that some developers have done better than others adding features that support the larger screen on a tablet vs. a phone. I have an old Android Phone which is Froyo 2.2 so I'm not sure if it's the new 3.1 Honeycomb OS or the Toshiba touches but there are some great widgets that I don't have on my phone. The Bookmarks widget is very cool and places the home page of all your bookmarks in a scrollable window on the desktop - very cool.Copying Files:I hooked it up with the included USB cable to my home PC and copied over some music in MP3 format, some movies in MP4 format, some pictures in JPG format and it was super easy. The home PC recognized the device right away and I was off to the races. Everything played fine on the nice Toshiba Media Player app that the tablet came with - very nice because it handles ALL media. There's also a really nice File Manager app which makes it easy to see and manage what you've copied. I used my 16GB USB flash drive to copy over a few files and it also worked perfectly. I tried plugging in a 170GB external hard drive to copy some more movies over and I'm sorry to say this did NOT work. The tablet froze and I had to hold down the power button to do a full re-start.Simulcasting:One of the things I really wanted to be able to do was simulcast movies played on the tablet with my 60 inch HD TV. I used this HDMI cable BlueRigger High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet 6.6 Feet (2m) - Supports 3D and Audio Return [Latest Version] that I ordered from Amazon when I ordered the Thrive. It worked perfectly! In fact, once you hook up the cable, everything you do on the tablet shows up on the TV. The kids played Angry Bird while we watched on the TV. I can see us on vacation playing videos we make and pictures we take on the TV in the hotel room since most of them now have HDMI inputs.Form Factor:Like everyone else, I'll mention that it's a little thick but I love the rubber-like textured back which makes it easy to handle. I'll give up super thin for all of the connectivity in a heartbeat. I did buy this 360 case Toshiba Thrive Portfolio 360 Case for 10.1-Inch Tablet (PA1495U-1TWC)which is so far working out really well. I like that it can stand the tablet up in portrait or landscape mode.Battery:Pretty darn good. We've been messing with this thing a ton and I'm still working off the original charge. I do shut it all the way down when I'm done so I know that helps quite a bit.In Summary:I did my homework and I'm not disappointed at all. This is a great tablet for people like me that hate \"Apple Jail\". My kids don't want to put it down but my wife makes them.ORIGINAL PRE-HANDS-ON REVIEW:I've spent quite a bit of time looking at 10.1 inch tablets and I have some very specific needs that Toshiba has nailed.- Wireless-N Wi-Fi networking and Bluetooth with connectivity to peripherals; I don't want to get forced into another expensive plan from a wireless carrier (Xoom, are you listening?). I can always tether from my existing Droid phone.- Full-sized and mini USB ports as well as an SD card slot; I can easily transfer files including a bunch of MP4 movies I have to the tablet and I can expand the memory with an SD memory card (Samsung, are you listening? Asus, you were close but I needed to buy the keyboard I don't want to get the USB port).- HDMI output; One of the things I want to do is use my tablet to play MP4 movies and simulcast them on my 60 inch flat screen TV in full 1080p mode (Samsung can't do this).- User-Replaceable Battery; I have a spare battery for my Droid phone and every time I've used it I could not help but think \"what would I do without this\". It's just such a great option to have. Plus, as mentioned in an earlier review, eventually these batteries die.- Honeycomb 3.1; I want the tablet OS not the smartphone OS (Sorry Asus, you almost had me).I hope they release it soon and don't price it too high because I really want one.", "Date": "June 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good Tablet but OS does not connect to mobile phone wifi hotspot", "Author": "J. Lo \"jl\"", "ReviewID": "R2J7S8NK4VL9N7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I must say that I've waited and waited for that one perfect tablet to come around that has everything I want and need.  That includes SD card support, USB slots, HDMI port, and most importantly, a replaceable battery.  The Toshiba Thrive has everything I ever wanted in a tablet so I pre-ordered and received it yesterday.To my dismay, I am returning it today to Amazon because I cannot get the device to detect my phone's wifi Hotspot.  My ipod touch, my laptop, and even my digital camera can all see and connect to my phone's wifi Hotspot.  But this tablet cannot even \"see\" it.  After trying tirelessly to detect my wifi, I finally came across an app, WifiManager, that can \"see\" my phone's hotspot.  When I tried to connect, it tells me that \"ad-hoc\" network are not supported on Android.  Are you serious?  All of my other devices can connect to this \"ad-hoc\" network and Android cannot????  WifiManager also links me to the Google Android Issues Forum:  Issue #82 - wifi- support ad hoc networking [...]It turns out that this issue was reported to Google back in 2008 but they never fixed it.  So if your internet connection is via an \"ad-hoc\" network (most likely any Mobile Phone WIFI Hotspot), this tablet will not work with it.  I bought this tablet strictly for mobile computing.  I was hoping to use my phone's wifi hotspot for internet connection with this device.  But since this device cannot detect or use the hotspot connection, it's basically unusable for me.  If anyone reading this know of a solution, please comment.  I did see some posting about a hack requiring rooting the device but I am not comfortable rooting or hacking it.I give this tablet 5 stars for having all the hardware I ever wanted in a tablet but 0 star for Google Android OS for ignoring the most basic requirement for mobile internet connectivity.  That averages out to 2.5 stars but I'll round it up to 3 stars.  If all other devices can use an ad-hoc network, why can't Honeycomb?  As much as I hate iShackle products, I have no choice but to get an iPad.  This is very upsetting.  Thanks for nothing Google!  I was so looking forward to owning this tablet and you really disappoint me.Got some great feedback from various people indicating that they can connect to their mobile phone's hotspot.  So, this likely only applies to phones that use the ad-hoc network.  I was using my Windows phone to create the hotspot and it uses ad-hoc network.  From the comments below, it sounds like you may be able to connect using an Android hotspot phone.  You should try your connection at the store before purchasing this product to make sure your phone works with this tablet.", "Date": "July 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "If Battery needed through Warranty - Just Buy One", "Author": "SSG Ausborn", "ReviewID": "R3F8TWWNABGJW6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "If you use a debit card they will charge you the $190 up front and will not be able to reimburse you.

Lets put this in perspective, you say 3 gigs of apps is plenty right?  Consider this, I have a Need For Speed game from EA sports installed (461megs), I also have Google Currents installed with 21 magazines inside it (1.13gb) and Google Music (237mbs)  \bfor a total of 1,728,000megabytes or 1.73gigabytes in three applications.  With that in mind I have about 1gb left for apps and with the rest of my apps I have run out of space, try updating apps when out of space.......argh.  So why didn't I just get an SD card and move the apps over to it?  I bought one but not a single application can be moved over to it, even apps that I KNOW for a fact should be able to move to the card (Nexflix) for example...nope.  APP2CD does not allow it and Norton Utilities will not either.  So, I can't even update Google Currents for \"current news/tech stories\", it says my memory is full, guess I can delete some of the books but I don't want to and I don't want to play the game of \"do I like this application I installed last week enough or do I delete it to make room for this new app in the market, it looks cool\".  I am VERY upset.  If you plan on installing applications with big footprints or games that take advantage of the Nvidia chipset you better think twice.  One final note, in settings/storage it shows I still have over 2gb of space left, that is not app space it is picture/doc/video space.UPDATE: You cannot uninstall Kaspersky Tablet Security.

It had all the features I was looking for - all the ports, the right proc, Android 3.1, etc.And it was missing a feature I failed to check: pre-stressed glass (like Gorilla Glass). It also included 3 bonus \"features\" I had hoped not to see: lousy customer service, incompetent repair, and parts price gouging.  Lets take these one at a time, shall we?1. Lousy Customer Service: So one day my son drops the device no more than 2 feet flat onto its rubberized back on soft linoleum.  And the glass cracks. I called Toshiba to see if they might help me, as the product was purchased at full retail price just 2 weeks earlier.  The case and the tablet with tax came to ~$750.  Nope, the manager said they help no one under any circumstances when the glass cracks.  They assume it is always the customer's fault.  If you drop the tablet 1 inch and the glass breaks - your fault.  If the glass breaks when you are holding the product, or when you are taking off the back cover - your fault.  Don't laugh - there are numerous reports of Thrive glass breaking with no external stress.So Toshiba takes no responsibility in using cheap glass on a product they imply is \"tough\".  In fact, the opposite is true.  I told a friend about my Thrive experience, and he explained how his Xoom (which *has* Gorilla Glass) had survived being flung across his concrete garage after being forgotten on his SVU roof.  Compare this with reports Thrive screens cracking from *being held*.2. Incompetent Repair: So I considered sending my product in for repair.  Turns out the glass cost ~$200 to repair to start, or ~$310, at their discretion.  And then I found numerous posts on how poor and slow the repair was.  I decided to forego this adventure, so I ordered the parts to repair it myself.  $62 for the glass, and $10 for some replacement sponges.  At least I could live with that ...3. Parts price gouging: So what does an amoral company do when it releases a defective product?  Issue a recall and fix the defect?  No, Padawan, what do you think this is, Automotive?  Toshiba seizes the opportunity to maximize shareholder value by leveraging its awful product quality to gouge the consumer!  Remember the parts order I mentioned in (2) above?  Well, TWO WHOLE MONTHS after I ordered those parts from the Toshiba USA authorized parts dealer, the order was cancelled.  Why?  Because Toshiba \"reconfigured its supply chain\" and discontinued the glass.  But wait!  All is not lost: now I can get the same order with a $160 bezel + glass assembly, and the $10 sponges.  After shipping, the replacement cost therefore is nearly $200 for the glass, not counting my labor.  These days, I can buy an entire tablet at that price!If it weren't for the poor quality glass, the lousy customer service, the incompetent repair, or the parts price gouging, I'd recommend this product.  As it is, I'd recommend you look at a 10.1 tablet from Acer, Asus, Motorolla, or Samsung.

However unless you have decent technical background, I would recomend you stay away from Android devices for a year or two until they can improve the quality and consistency of their products.As for my Thrive issues, the SD slot was read only and I could not get it to write to any SD cards I had (which worked in all my other devices).  Upon investigating the problem with Toshiba support and reading the on-line forums, I found this was a common problem and yet there was no fix or acknowledgement from Toshiba.My next issue was the calendar app which for some reason would sometimes not accept recurring appointments. Again I found many online complaints, the only fix being to download a new calendar app from Android market.Lastly Android market should be called Android Flea market.

10.1-Inch Tablet Computer (Aluminum Metallic) that I had gotten for my dad.  It feels a little thicker and has more plastic overall as the whole back is a removable plate and the design looks a little better on the Iconia.  On the inside, both seem to be pretty responsive as expected running on the Honeycomb where both can be updated to 3.2 easily by going to the settings.  Included power adapter is a bit bigger and around the same size as that of my netbook for the Thrive while the Iconia one is more travel friendly and slightly smaller.Initial impressions of the overall build and the connections are positive and will see as time goes on how it holds up when my friend starts using it.Pros:Price was pretty decent over the lightning dealsFull sized SD cardUSB port and mini USB portMini HDMI Port for outputNice display from what I played withCons:3 ports are all on one side but may not be a big issueOverall plastic feeling which may or may not be a bad thing depending on casesVideo includes unbox, updates, and playing a little with the tablet.", "Date": "December 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not too stable", "Author": "C.

I wanted to have a better alternative to my I pad which my kids use to play games so I can't get on the thing when I need it!firstly I am impressed with the ports and options, and I like the fact that with android, I can just drag and drop videos and music and not have to worry about connecting the device to another PC and having iTunes wipe the thing clean. I also like the pre installed quick office and other useful apps which I don't have to buy.Now, the reason it is annoying me is that I'm having a horrible experience with web browsing. The individual letters respond slowly when pressed so the typing is not smooth. It is also slow when pressing backspace and makes typing a tedious task. In addition to this the browser doesn't work on a lot of pages. For some reason when I'm in my webmail or certain sites, it wont let me scroll down so I can only see half a page. Also, sites using JavaScript slideshows or similar coded functionality do not work and they freeze the browser which quits to the home desktop. Scrolling down a page by hand when it works is awful and nowhere near as smooth as the I pad. I think android has long way to go.Battery life I hear Up to 9 hours but I am getting 6 with only web browsing.I do like the movie functions and a lot of people in forums were moaning about no divx support however I downloaded qqplayer and its playing everything although one 720p documentary I added skips badly when played which shocked me as the device has decent processor and ram.What is worst though is trying to place the cursor anywhere in your text. I wanna throw the damn thing out the window.. I touch where I want to edit text and it goes miles away...then the green arrow to move the cursor is nowhere near where the actual cursor shows. Its so frustrating....I'm using the tablet now and I've been typing this for 20 mins...Overall I'm not very happy in terms of typing and browsing but for movies and music its fine. I hope these things get ironed out or this is getting handed down to my fiance and Im getting an I pad 2 until these android tabs catch up.OK look below and you will see more of what I was typing and the cursor jumped around so I had to retype that  section.... I have tried for 10 minutes to place the cursor down to the bottom of the review typing box to delete the sentence but i can't do it!!!!!!! to reviewWhat is worst though is trying to move the cursor when typing....its pretty impossible I want to throw the damn thing out the window.....go ahead and ts", "Date": "July 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "A Bit of Perspective on a Few Issues", "Author": "Uncle Guy", "ReviewID": "R4YXCMSUTJL99", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I will not list all the Pros and Cons for the Toshiba Thrive, but wanted to add a little perspective to the comments concerning...Weight:Let's define it by comparing something common in the United States. The weight of coins. Specifically, the US Quarter, which weighs 5.67 grams.Based on Order of Lightest Tablet to Heaviest of the main tablets under discussion...Samsung Tab 10.1 = 565 grams.Apple iPad2 = 601 grams -- that's 6 US Quarters, plus not quite a Dime, heavier than the Samsung.Asus Transformer = 680 grams -- that's 20 US Quarters, plus not quite a Dime, heavier than the Samsung; nearly 14 US Quarters heavier than the iPad2.Toshiba Thrive = 725 grams -- that's 28 US Quarters, plus not quite a Dime, heavier than the Samsung; nearly 22 US Quarters heavier than the iPad2; nearly 8 heavier than the Transformer. One other note on the Thrive -- the Charger they supply weighs 9.4 ounces. Over half a pound. If it matters to you.So... take 8 US Quarters and hold them in your hand. I would put 4 in each hand if you want to get a \"balanced\" feel. All 8 in one hand tells you how much heavier the Thrive should feel compared to the Transformer if you are holding it with one hand. However -- and this can be a big HOWEVER -- none of this takes into consideration the effects of how that weight is distributed within the tablet in question. More weight concentrated in different areas might make it \"feel\" heavier than it really is. A good 20-minute session at a local store might answer those issues for you better than this concept.Screen Quality:Everything is a little subjective in the statements you'll read. I love the looks of the Transformer's screen. Not having it next to the Thrive to critique it, I could still live with the Thrive. But if you take on the idea of objective testing, you might want to visit Display Mate's round-up testing of many of the tablets you are considering -- not yet including the Thrive. Their conclusion? Samsung's is fantastic -- potentially the best on the market -- but is crippled by over-saturation of colors (meaning, it's not life-like) with no means to correct it. With a decent color control program, they feel it could be far better than all others. They would place the iPad2 at the top of the pack -- for now -- concerning color display accuracy. With the Transformer running a close third.They state that most people will be surprised to learn that their assumption that the 10.1 screens of these new Android tablets are much larger than the iPad2 is incorrect -- based partly on how you define the \"screen\". Part of the Android screens are all blocked by the Android System Bar, and the Aspect Ratios put their real estate quite a bit closer than you might think.I'm not an anti-Apple, nor an anti-Android individual. I'm still trying to figure out if a tablet of any kind fits my lifestyle other than as \"a thing of interest\" that I will abandon a few months from now. Like a Rubik's cube. Ideally, all I want is something to read a color magazine or newspaper on without having to pay $15 a month for each digital title, or to play with on the internet, or to watch the occasional YouTube video -- but I'd prefer doing that at 4G speeds. Samsung's 4G Tab 10.1 just launched at Verizon, but I'm thinking the Thrive tethered to my 3G phone would suffice, for now -- based on the crazy pricing for the 4G version and the additional service fees. No, I have NOT done this, yet -- so it may be a tricky operation. In fact, I have not decided on which Tablet to buy. If any. I'm leaning heavily toward the Transformer or the Thrive, but my decision is a little complicated because I already own an Asus Eee Netbook. What does surprise me is how many people will make a big deal about the Weight issue -- then immediately buy a heavy leather case to protect the unit. Or they'll buy the best-looking screen available -- then immediately cover it with an ugly screen protector that has bubbles and grit caught underneath. 8-)", "Date": "August 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Tosheba thrive old [2 years] outdated technolgy.", "Author": "john", "ReviewID": "R2S5RELI5T6XYX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is a poor substitute for Apple I-pad mini, I returned this refurbished \"Thrive\" tablet and did not receive credit, and I am still looking for the \"tracking number\" proving I returned it.I asked Amazon to try to resolve this problem.", "Date": "January 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "really!!!", "Author": "lea", "ReviewID": "R2IT42DUGUI76Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i loved it and i was waiting the mint i can go to all my kids and show my new tablet!! but..... it was big i dint realize the 10 inch is so big!!!so i returned it but i was let whit mmmm i did good to let go?????", "Date": "April 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Do Not Buy This Product!", "Author": "Louis C.

So I will go over the negatives first.Cons:1) Heavy and bulky. If you're expecting to use this tablet with one hand, go for the Ipad or Galaxy Tab instead. I often tab while laying down on a bed before sleep, and have found the Thrive not the most comfortable to use. Holding the tab with one hand seems risky enough. Because 1) you have to grip it hard, but that'll smudge everything up, and 2) the risk of dropping the Thrive seems too great. The tablet is heavier, which means, the bigger they are, the harder they fall, which means it's not as fun toting the tablet around. Portability is compromised.2) Speaker quality. In my testing, the sound was not very loud, it's tinny. And in fact my unit was defective because of the left speaker which eventually stopped working altogether. Was the low sound quality the result of the fact that my Thrive was only working with one full speaker, vs two? Maybe, but I don't think this aspect of the Thrive improves much with both speakers restored. (I am currently awaiting a replacement, but that's a different story. -I purchased my tab from elsewhere.)3) Speakers location. The speakers are on the \"bottom\" of the tablet, in landscape mode. Sure you can flip the thing over so that they face on the top, although one will run into problems when opening apps that use landscape natively and you find yourself having to flip the tab back over. The reason the locations make for bad design is that often the tab will be resting on something - your lap or your desk, where the speakers will be covered and therefore muffled. The sound on the Thrive is already relatively poor - it doesn't help to have the speakers covered as well. This is either a major flaw or a small annoyance depending on how you see it. (And because the tab is cumbersome, you'll NEED to rest it on your lap -- or risk dropping it!)4) Camera location. They are on the left side. On an Android tablet, the left hand does a lot of work. This means you'll be getting a lot of greasy smudges on the lens, both the front and back. And, again, sure you can use the tablet in portrait mode, or flip it over again in landscape and have the camera lens on the right side, but, again, this creates a different annoyance, eg, in portrait both speakers are now on one side only.5) Camera quality. The Thrive has a 2mb front and 5mb rear-facing camera. Seems good but videos taken with Thrive camera are adequate but just don't seem all that great. Don't expect to turn on the camera and be looking into a mirror.6) USB ports. - What? Isn't this the pro, nay, THE SELLING POINT, of the Thrive? Yes. But I list it as a con because a regular user such as myself with ordinary external harddrives, who doesn't use thumbdrives, will not be able to connect the Thrive to those harddrives. The Thrive does not recognize harddrives not formatted in exFat32. And it takes a long time for the Thrive to scan those drives that are in that format. So, the Thrive, championed for its connectivity, especially in comparison to the Ipad and Galaxy Tab, has ports that are pretty much useless. This is a major FAIL and can't be overstated. Until Toshiba releases updates that corrects this, this con is, IMO, the biggest one. It's a \"con\" in more than one sense.Pros:1) Fast charge time. From 5% to 99% charge, the Thrive takes a little more than an hour.However, its battery life was not more than 6 hours, that is with regular usage (in my hands at least - Youtube browsing, web browsing, app downloading, live wallpaper).Other reviewers claim 10+ hours. I have to wonder what they are doing with their tablets, if anything.Otherwise, the fast charge time kind of makes up for it.2) SD card slot. If you buy only the 16 gb version, you'll be fine because of that slot.3) User-replaceable battery. This is huge. All rechargeable batteries die. Some sooner than others. A replaceable battery is a huge selling and re-selling point. It gives the Thrive longevity.4) The Toshiba File Manager is an app in the Thrive that enables the user to browse files in memory very much like one would a PC. From what I understand, this is not easy to do in other Android tablets.5) User-replaceable back plate. There are 5 different, attractive colors. The feel of these back plates give substance to the Thrive. And because it's replaceable, it's disposable if it's ever worn in anyway.6) Ease of use. The Thrive operates smooth enough. Though I do find its battery life lacking, I am able to do what I normally do on a computer - execute programs, web browse, watch videos, play games listen to music -- with little if any lag.7) Looks better than most other Android tablets. This is subjective to me. But I just like its styling better than, say, the Asus Transformer, or, say, the Blackberry Playbook. But then again, the Thrive's styling is kind of related to many of the cons and annoyances I've noted with it.Overall, the Thrive is a capable tablet with a good enough speed and good enough screen- a screen better than my laptop and HDtv, in fact. But look elsewhere if you need a tab with adequate stereo sound and look elsewhere if you're looking for a light tablet you can use with one hand and don't have to worry about dropping or smashing into a wall.", "Date": "July 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Disappointed but hopeful", "Author": "Amjedi", "ReviewID": "R3UZO98SEJ8QYY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I like the tablet but the apps pale in comparison to Ipad & Droid phones! I purchased the Thrive tablet because I like Toshiba computers and I love my Droid phone.  I assumed that at a minimum, the tablet would have the same apps that the phone has - WRONG! For example, there is no Facebook app.  You can get on Facebook by using the Browser but given the popularity of Facebook, why isn't there an app for it? Toshiba also brags about the superior quality of the picture when watching videos but you can only watch videos that you have stored on the tablet.  I don't want to store DVD's on the tablet; I just assumed that they would have apps for streamed media: (e.g., Netflix, Xfinity, HBOGO). This was a MAJOR disappointment.  I had major discussions/arguments about buying the Thrive over the Ipad with Ipad users and the one argument they kept giving me was that the Ipad had superior apps.  At the time, I thought this would not be a problem since I like the apps that I have on my Droid phone & assumed the tablet would have access to the same apps.  I really hope that Toshiba creates the mechanism to enjoy more of the apps that customers can get on their phones; this is such a disappointment that I haven't even told people I got the Thrive bc there really isn't anything to rave about yet.

Its got all the full size ports, sure, but other than that, I have to say that its pretty unremarkable.Actually, I take that back. It is remarkable in that since the latest update, it seems to not be working properly. It has force closes all the time, and it also has the \"sleep of death\" issue, when it goes to sleep and won't wake up without a restart. Hopefully Toshiba comes out with a fix for that, sharpish.Now for the good. It runs Honeycomb, which is still very, very good despite it being very early in its life. The iPad can't multitask like this. Tablet apps aren't that plentiful, but there are still apps out there for pretty much anything that you would need. If you're looking for a ridiculous amount of apps, then get an iPad.But the thing that keeps me from returning this tablet and hoping that Toshiba irons out all the issues is the leather folio case that Toshiba sells with it. I love it. The Galaxy and the Xoom would both benefit from having a case like this.

Miller", "ReviewID": "R3DBNNPBM5MGKC", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "review thriveAs soon as I opened it, I was able to use my iPad2.  The thrive has a user's guide link on the front screen, but it is an online link.  That meant no guide to hook up to the wireless.  I have an android phone so was familiar with the interface, but it seems putting the user manual on the system would have been painless and made life easier for customers new to the OS.I figured out how to get online, now I need to download the user's guide.  My thrive was a gift, so I don't know the model number.  No problem right?  Wrong, going to settings, about tablet, gives me a product version number and a name of AT105.  But the user manual cannot be accessed until I give it a product number of AT105-XXXXX.  I do not know the xxxxx so I have to go online on a different system, type the product number I found in system info into Google and have it tell me the product number I want.I finally get to enter the product number and go to a site that allows me to download the manual, unfortunately, having no user manual to tell me otherwise, I tap the link.  It turns blue and then back to white, nothing else happens.  Several tries later, I tap and hold the link, now I have some options.  Open, Open in new tab, Save link, copy link url, or select text.  None of these intuitively tell me to download or save file. So I try open.  So far it has been ten minutes and that apparently failed.  I decide on Save link, a window briefly opens saying starting download then disappears.There is a statement on the site that says \"Once downloaded, you'll find the User's Guide using the File Manager app.  Navigate to the download folder, touch the \"Thrive-AT-100_users_guide_062311.pdf\" file and open it with QuickOffice.  Remember, I still don't have a user's guide to explain what all that means.Now I finally get to the document.  As far as I can tell, there is no way to turn the page.  You scroll through a large document being careful not to shoot past the page you are looking for.  On the iPad, I swipe a finger, or if I am truly lazy just tap the edge of the screen I want to go in and I am on the next page.  This document requires me to scroll up and stop the scroll manually.  Annoying!!!Oh well, I need to register it now.  I tap register, it wants the serial number.  Back to settings about tablet, but there is no way to cut and paste the serial number so back to the PC, open notepad, type the SN then back to register and input the Serial number.  Imagine my dismay when I get this message in bright red letters, Internal error(RM101), please try again later or call 1-800-457-7777.So I call Toshiba customer support center.  Oh boy, I get to talk to the phone mail system.  I hate talking to the computer!  Once I get past the electronic sentry I get a guy that obviously does not speak my language as a primary one.  He wants my name, phone number, email address, yada, yada, yada....We finally get to my issue and he repeats everything back that I said and asks me if he understands my issue.  Then he puts me on hold to ask someone else what that error code is.  I learn it will be one to two hours before the server is patched and could I please try again.Maybe I will post more later, but I will say not an auspicious start for the Toshiba Thrive.", "Date": "September 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Worst 10.1 tablet out there!", "Author": "Sabrina J.

While it touts its video capabilities, the Thrive will not play content from HBO Go, Netflix, Hulu and other streaming provider formats. If you want to use its video abilities, you need to download the movies and play them on the tablet, not strem them. The way that it handles its SD card is a bit cumbersome, acting more like an external hard drive than an SD card incorporated into the OS. The Thrive has no ability to handle ad hoc WiFi connections, making it difficult to tether and worthless to operate ad hoc connected devices. I have an AR.Drone by Parrot, and cannot use the Thrive to control it for the lack of ad hoc abilities. Also, this purchase used Amazon as a selling vehicle, but does not fall under Amazon return and replacement policies.

I'm sitting in a recliner typing this review on my new iPad 2. I mention this because that's what I'd come to know from my tablet experience, and it just wasn't the same with the Thrive. The Thrive is very feature-rich, and Honeycomb Android very slick. I won't dive into the features, because you can find those on the product page and elsewhere. There was simply just too much going on with the Thrive for my taste. Android is one thing, but the widescreen and accommodating the ports into the device on the thrive translates into a larger device, making typing out something like this review more of a chore than you would think playing with the device in the store.. For the time being at least, I have a Motorola Droid Bionic Android phone. Navigating through the Bionic in the palm of your hand with a finger or two...not so bad. Navigating through an Android tablet - tedious in comparison. The iPad is clean and smooth experience all around. My opinion - if you're looking for all of the features that set the Thrive apart from the iPad as well as other Android tablets, then you probably should be looking for a laptop. No need to mention the differences in the App market, other than to say that I'm a musician and Android just doesn't have much for musicians. If I were you I'd check out the apps before settling on an Android Tablet. If you're on the fence with iPad on one side and Thrive or other Android on the other, just scratch the iPad itch.

The 3.2 version was released by Toshiba in Sept 15th, 2011. The both units came with tons of problems. Toshiba Service Station shows the new updates, but the tablet do not update the system upon clicking 'update' to the latest version (3.2). Toshiba Customer Service is one of the worst, untrained people in the technology companies. They opened up my case # and told me to hold on any new 3.2 update until they fix their bugs in WiFi connection, Apps and other Andriod software related problems. They will let me know when this bugs were fixed..guess what?.. I never received any e-mail or call from even I called them every week.Wi-Fi sucks and goes off all the time. The apps turns off automatically and brings me back to the home page. Web sites suddenly becomes slow and then turn off completely. I have to switch OFF/ON to bring this thing to the life.  The battery life is no more than 5 hour. The sleep switch and volume switches are located on the side and you can not find them most of the time because of their black color and flat with the cover. iPad at least has this switch right at the front. The overall buit quality of the Thrive is horrible. It seems like made from cheap plastic made at the junk overseas company, assemble and tested by very unprofessional people.This Tablet is total JUNK..DO not buy any Toshiba Tablet products..at least my son and daughter have the iPad 2 with zero problems and best Apple CS (they have to fix Foxxconn issues in China though). I and my wife are really tired of this JUNK and decided to sell on e-bay at the half price. I will vever buy any Toshiba product and Google Android products any loger.

(True review from a techie)", "Author": "MacMaster", "ReviewID": "R1P5ND0R1BR774", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First of all I'm not an apple fanboy even though my nick name is MacMaster.Second of all please rate if this is helpful.Also I'd like to say that, this is my sixth tablet, and I'm not a regular user. I can design and build computers, and develop software for them, that being said I think I know about computers and tablets.It's been 2 weeks and I believe its time for me to review this tablet.-Before I purchased my toshiba thrive, I've read so many positive reviews about it, and after owning a couple other tablets (which I will talk about) I figured Toshiba must have nailed it.I was wrong.-What makes Toshiba Thrive \"different\" than the other tablets?It has a full size USB and an HDMI outlet, do you really need these outlets? depends, most of us own both computers and a some sort of media center at hour homes, so don't let HDMI outlet fool you, having full size USB is okay but it is not like you will be using it everyday. It also has an user replaceable battery, you see this is 21st century we don't use these gadgets for more than 2 years anymore, back then in 90s we could use the same phone or PC for 3+ years, no more.  So why would you wanna replace the battery on a tablet? Toshiba is selling their battery for thrive for 69.99, sounds like its a good deal? well it is not. Apple will replace your iPad's battery for 105, and iPad's battery is about 2.5x times bigger than the thrive's battery (capacity wise). So the next question would be; does it worth having a tablet 2 times(almost) thicker than an iPad 2 just because you can replace the battery by your self? I would say No.Before talking about the battery life and performance I'd like to talk about Thrive's built quality, because that is one of the reasons I returned my thrive yesterday.-Built QualityI don't know what other reviewers were thinking when they wrote their reviews but Thrive has a cheap feel, it's not well built. I'll tell you why, first of all since I'm in the design field, I can tell that Toshiba didn't spend enough time to design this tablet, they rushed this to the market and  hoped to get a place in android tablet market, anyway like some other reviewers stated, the glass is not well glued, the bezel around the screen is lower or higher than the screen, like it's not at the same level with the glass, unless you push down the glass with your fingers. The \"chrome\" bezel around the cameras kills the tablet, like it's so cheaply made you see that sort of chrome plastic on cheaply made auto accessories, they could at least use some sort of brushed metal, chrome is not that popular anymore. The back cover is a joke. I have no clue what toshiba was thinking when they came up with that back cover, it has rough edges and the quality of the plastic is terrible, and instead of HUGE Toshiba logo, they could've put a nice THRIVE (very idiotic name for a tablet, and LG had a cell phone called thrive so I don't know why they picked that name, like T1 would be a better name for their first tablet with android os) logo on the back with a small Toshiba logo under it or somewhere. I even had a chance to buy other colors, got the silver cover on amazon and the blue one from best buy, they both look very cheap, and not worth 20 bucks. I'll put it this way, a 99 dollar refurbished amazon kindle looks and feels better than a 399 thrive, that little e-reader is very well built, and it doesn't look like you made it at home. (thrive lovers don't hate me, if you don't believe me, go hold a kindle or a Samsung Galaxy 10.1)Now you may be thinking that I'm just exaggerating what I wrote up there, well I'm not, I compared thrive with iPad, iPad 2, Galaxy 10.1, Xoom, Playbook. Asus Transformer, and Acer Iconia. I was fortunate enough to own and use all of those tablets I listed there, and still have the iPad 2.-ScreenToshiba claims their screen on thrive is superior, hmm I guess they haven't seen the screen on Samsung Galaxy 10.1 or the BB Playbook. There is simply nothing special with Thrive's screen and I don't like the vertical view on it. Galaxy 10.1 sure has a better screen.-PerformanceJust like many other honeycomb tablets toshiba has the nvidia tegra 2 cpu and 1 Gb ram,  thrive works just like a Galaxy 10.1 or a Xoom, never had any frozen screens or anything, so no issues with the performance.-Battery lifeVery impressive, I was able to surf/chat/watch stuff for about 11 hours, good thing about thrive's battery is, it can  be fully charged in about an hour, which really makes it special.-Hold and feelIt really is nice to hold it, you don't really get tired even though its somewhat heavier than the other tablets I have listed up there, the rubberized back feels good in your hands (wish it wasn't cheaply built), but unfortunately it feels cheap, its not the tablet you'd be proud to use during a business meeting.-Honeycomb on thrive (Operating system)Honeycomb is okay, since it works flash and great apps, it is the best OS on tablets (for now). User interface is a joke though, can't say I like the menus or the clock when you wake up your tablet. One thing that bothered me was Thrive came with so many junk apps and I wasn't able to remove them. Anyway unfortunately this is not a pure android tablet (like motorola xoom) meaning it gets its system updates from toshiba through toshiba service center app (very unnecessary), so while xoom is running the latest version of honeycomb, thrive users are stuck with 3.1 still.Like many other reviewers said it used to have the this problem causing users to reset their tablets after their tablets go to sleep because they refused to wake up from sleep, its fixed with the update toshiba released so its not a problem now, Honeycomb on thrive is still a bit buggy, but will please the regular users for now. Oh almost forgot, still no Netflix or Hulu support, that is a deal breaker at this point, after all who wouldn't like to watch Mad Men on their tablets before going to sleep?-AccessoriesThrive has like no accessories, toshiba has this case for thrive, which makes your thrive look like its a Britannica encyclopedia (not lying with the case it is almost as thick as a Britannica). So unlike iPad 2 or Galaxy you won't be seeing so many accessories for thrive, the dock (50 something dollars) works okay but not necessary and does not come with the charger so its somewhat rip off. Bluetooth stuff works great with thrive, I was able to use apple's bluetooth keyboard with it with no problems.-ConclusionIf you are planning to buy an android tablet and spend your hard earned dollars on something you'd like to enjoy while using it and be proud of it, thrive is not the tablet for you, if you are working at a construction site or a general contractor, toshiba thrive can satisfy your needs (not because its durable or anything, the rubberized back and thick design make the thrive suitable for construction site, where looks don't matter) but if you are using it at home or office then you might wanna go with another tablet, I know I will sound like a fanboy but for now the best android tablet is Samsung Galaxy 10.1, its very well built and looks nice. You also might wanna check the Motorola Xoom out, for 449 its a bargain, it has 32gb built in memory, and it's almost as good as the Samsung Galaxy 10.1.Also I'm not even talking about Acer Iconia or Asus EEE transformer as they are not worth talking about, they are both cheaply built, and I don't really support companies that mark up their prices then lower them according to their sales, like you could get an Acer Iconia for 399 from target about two weeks ago, and get a 100 dollars gift card with your purchase to spend on groceries or whatever you want. Same with Asus, transformer's price changes almost everyday its like stocks. This is somewhat frustrating because I'm sure nobody wants to see their gadgets for less than what they paid for them, that is what I like about Apple, iPad has been 499 (cheapest model) forever now.Anyway  I am rating thrive 3 stars but if they lower its price to 299 for the 8gig model and 349 for the 16 gig then it would deserve 3.5 stars.Last but not least, Sony will be releasing their tablet on September 16, it seems like its gonna be one of the best Android tablets, but I really don't think it will be better than the Galaxy 10.1 or Xoom, it won't have gorilla glass (they said they would make the tablet heavier), so the screen will get scratched if you don't have a screen protector, which I'm sure you wouldn't wanna ruin the design of a beautiful tablet with a screen protector, also it comes with Honeycomb 3.1 so they are already behind Galaxy 10.1 and Xoom, but its still worth checking out.Thanks for reading, and rating, you can leave your questions and comments, I'll make sure to reply.And I apologize for any grammar, or spelling mistakes I have.

Second, and even more important, is that like many others have mentioned it will go to sleep and then not wake up without a manual restart.Therefore, even though I was willing to wait for an app to be developed, I was not willing to A) loose all my notes in the middle of class if it went to sleep, and B) have to sit there and wait for a full restart when I need to quickly jot down something the professor just said.Because Toshiba had known about the issue for at least a few months, according to the dates of the reviews at the time, I was concerned that they were not in any hurry to fix it.

Maybe they just don't care, as they have announced they are planning to release a brand new slimmer tablet to compete with the Galaxy tab 10.1. Don't buy this tablet, Toshiba makes great products but don't support the products they make. I bought this Thrive the first day it hit the market, and own Toshiba televisions and laptops. I'm unlikely to buy anything else from them because of the way they've handled this whole thing. More people need to know that this device doesn't play Netflix when all of it's competitors do. Maybe Toshiba will finally do something about this when enough people complain. I should not have to risk rendering my device useless just to be able to get what has become the most basic, standard functionality in Netflix.Edit: Now that the Thrive plays Netflix I couldn't be more happy with it.

I thought she couldn't use it because she was my 67 year old mother so as I was trying to help her, I noticed the problem did not lie with her.  The apps are impossible to find.  Switching from one screen to another is easy because it did it automatically right when we were in the middle of something and didn't want to switch.  Also, it turned off all by itself whenever it wanted and right in the middle of things.  When I searched for the Facebook app, it told me it wasn't available in the app store.  The app store only had about 20 apps that were easily findable.  The Apple iPad puts this little tablet to complete shame.

The reason? I asked them why the software updates they sent me via the Service Station could not be rolled back or improved and why Toshiba wouldn't fix my tablet due to their fault. They refused to allow me to ask the question and insisted that the problem was both mine and the software developer's - which is Google, apparently. When I pressed them to give me an answer to my problem with their update through the Service Station they hung up.I vow never to buy another Toshiba product.", "Date": "October 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good tablet in the first five days!", "Author": "Luis Badilla", "ReviewID": "R28NAXJW75OMJ4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've an inconvenient with this Toshiba tablet hard drive crashed later of five days of use.

Applications that are readily available from Apple or MS, are buried in dozens of worthless apps.

Sadly, a video player could just as easily load a virus and steal your personal info as play your favorite move (if you could get it to download).Android market support is miserable and is on the level of \"Peggy\" for effectiveness or resolution.As much as I detest the somewhat restrictive nature of the alternative offerings - at least every app they have actually works, and if you want to download a movie and watch it during a flight, you can do it easily.  I've been trying to get an app to do that for the Thrive for over two weeks now to no avail.  Lots of \"movie players\" apps in the market, but one cannot find the player Android Market support references, nor can android support find it either.Android is great if you have zero experience with real OS and/or lots of free time to waste, or little to do.

While generally speaking, I'm happy with it, I cannot get it to recognize the 32GB SDHC card no matter what I do.  I've erased and reformatted the SDHC card using different EFAT, NFTS, etc etc.  The Thrive will recognized the SDHC, and tell me how much memory I have, but will not allow me to move any apps to it.  My Motorola Droid X does this without any problems whatsoever.  I've spent 10 hours trying to solve this problem to no avail.  If you think you can live with the installed memory, then by all means buy one.  If you are not a computer expert, then reconsider.  Also, Toshiba has no support for this problem other than a Blog with lots of other people trying to figure out how to solve the problem.  This is my first and last Toshiba purchase.Here's another revelation:  the Android Operating System is retarded.  If you are accustomed to using Windows or Mac, you will find that Android does not have any of the sophistication you would normally expect.  The reason they call the 'Apps' is because they are not really full blown Programs, but endless collections of what used to be called utilities (little programs that do certain specific tasks.  You will spend hours looking for apps to do basic things like copying files, printing and so forth  Also, you will end up paying extra for useable apps, and wasting a boatload of time trying to find them.  While many of these are free, may of them monitor your activities, tap into your phone calls and track you using GPS, why they need to do this, I'm not sure.  BE CAREFUL--do not do any banking or financial transactions on the Android system unless you know what you are doing.  I will not.  While I have never been a big fan of Microsoft, less so for Apple, at least they are able to write somewhat professional, somewhat reliable software.  Android is none of this.

So I contacted the seller and told them if I could exchange it for another unit, since I really like the tablet.  But without the box, they emailed me that I would have to call the manufacturer to see if Toshiba could help.  In other words, they just pass on all the responsibility to the manufacturer.  This is no help at all!  Shouldn't the seller be the one to take back the product and return it to Toshiba?So I did call Toshiba directly.  But the tech support operator kept putting me on hold, and told me that they could only repair the unit.  But first I would have to register it before he would give me the address of Toshiba where I would have to ship back the unit.  I would then get it back 7-10 days after.  But the problem is, I bought the tablet because I intended to bring it with me to the Philippines, where I will be staying for 4-5 months.

There is no firmware update to fix so far, this takes 2 stars away and will trigger a return if the fix is not coming soon. I use Toshiba products for 20 years, never had to suffer so much, shame on their slow engineers, maybe they got too much shakes recently?Second is the SD card, full size alright, but won't store any apps, nor can it be monitored by the tablet for its status, if you use apps like Kindle to store books and media they stay in the internal memory which run out quickly, those who buy 8 & 16 gbs will be sorry for this, those who buy 32 gbs will be sorry to see competitor Acer charges $120 less. There might be a fix for this I hope, but the 32 gbs is a must and Toshiba over charges for it is a must!

A little common sense here would show if you did not \"RATE\" it well,you would not \"REVIEW\" it well or at all. Since there is little \"hands on\" of the Toshiba Tablet yet, any good \"REVIEW\" would be short.I for one \"REVIEW\" the Toshiba Tablet-BEST BANG FOR THE BUCK!Wayne", "Date": "May 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Way to go AMAZON!", "Author": "Regina Sharp \"ya fiction freaks\"", "ReviewID": "R1UJMN994UJMK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "eeeeeeekkkkkkkkkk! I am so glad that I found out about this, I have a Kindle that I love but was considering buying nookcolor for reading at night and for magazines and fun apps. But hesitant becuz I would not be able to get the Kindle app on it so that I could sync it and read the same book from both units anytime I wanted, the way I do my Ipod touch now with the Kindle app.I am assuming becuz this is android that I will be able to have the Kindle app on it and use it as an ereader too!Can't wait until this comes out for purchasing, I am saving now! Hopefully, it will be reasonably priced and not overpriced like the Ipad.Very excited Amazon customer!", "Date": "April 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Expectation from Japanese Corporation", "Author": "Kien", "ReviewID": "R1QUEX6102UONS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have recently check out all tablets. I keep myself far from anything with prefix \"i\". At first, I almost ran into Samsung galaxy tab, but I couldn't buy it because amazon does not offer shipment to Japan. So I kept checking out and come across this one. So adorable, so much expectation, as far as I can see.I am living in Japan and I am probably biased but goods made by Panasonic, Sony or Toshiba are much more expected by myself than any others. Their products always are outstanding somehow, I cannot even explain.Some have written many about its features, but I don't know much so I keep silent.

The screen resolution is alright, battery life avg, and it consistently freezes when you plug in your usb to upload music, movies, or games.  It is average at best and the pricing does not compare to the ipad or samsung tab.  The quality seems very cheap and in my personal opinion it is not worth it.
