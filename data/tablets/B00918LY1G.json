{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Wow, well worth the money!", "Author": "Chris in Phoenix", "ReviewID": "R3HNT9UGAUK35T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have several Android devices - phones and other tablets. I wanted a tablet for my daughter for Christmas; she is 8, and very tablet savvy (they use them at school, and also she uses mine). The pink case sold me on it, and the price (< $80 delivered). However, I was skeptical of the cost, and how functional it would really be.First off, it shipped very fast by USPS. It arrived within a few days. It was pristine. Along with the tablet was a screen protector, USB cable, charger, USB type-A adapter (which I assume is to connect USB devices such as flash drives and *maybe* keyboard - I plan to test both of these later today), earbud headphones and a decent (although unnecessary) stylus. Initially, I thought the screen was scratched, and not very responsive, but there is a protective plastic cover over it. Take that off, and put the screen protector on instead and it looks and works great. The capacitive touch is very good, especially considering the price.It has decent performance. It came right up on my office network, and worked flawlessly. Netflix streamed very smoothly. Video playback from Netflix and MP4 files I copied from my PC worked great. Audio playback was reasonable for a tablet, and sounded very good with headphones. Sound through the speaker with video and audio playback was fine (plenty loud). Skype worked fine also, as did various games I tried (Angry Birds and Fruit Ninja come installed). The Android app store came right up, and I had no problem downloading apps and music.By default, the tablet comes in USB storage device mode, which did not work with Windows 7 x64. Not sure why. I switched the tablet to Media Device mode and was able to copy photos, music and video to it with no issues. The popup keyboard worked fine; no issues. Typing emails and texts works great; it synced right up to my Gmail account no problem.Overall, I am very impressed. This is well worth the money. The display is nice, and very readable. The battery seems comparable to my wife's Nook Color. With a bit of tweaking, this could be a fantastic tablet for anyone. Well worth the money. In fact, I am amazed at the price. I highly recommend.MORE INFO - NEXT DAYSome additional info for those considering this tablet. The USB port is a micro USB, same as what you find on most Android smart phones and tablets. It uses the same cable and charger as my Motorola RAZR MAXX and my wife's DROID X2. Also, it appears to support OTG (on-the-go) USB. It will connect to a PC to transfer files (photos, documents, videos, etc.) and will also connect to a USB flash drive. Inside the box is a Type-A USB adapter cable. You connect your USB flash drive to it, then connect to the Zeepad and open the Android file manager (see photos). Also, I connected a USB keyboard this morning in the same way (via the Type-A adapter) and that worked, too. I was able to type/edit a letter, and type an email. No app was required for the keyboard, it was immediately recognized.I have tested Netflix, Skype, video playback, music playback, Angry Birds, Fruit Ninja, Temple Run, Pinball Deluxe, Hulu Plus, Lookout (anti-virus/malware app), Dolphin Web browser, Google Play, Gmail, and Kindle app (and store) and it all works great. No complaints. I've tested WiFi in three places, including home an office, and it was flawless and fast. The SD flash card slot is a MicroSD, not the standard SD card you find in most digital cameras. The MicroSD is very common on smart phones and tablets. The Zeepad 7 looks to support 16 GB cards with no issues.Android System App says the OS is 4.0.4 (Ice Cream Sandwich). Kernel build is 3.0.8+. Internal storage shows max 1008 MB for downloaded apps + 1636 MB for app data, and photos/videos/music transferred from your PC. Max RAM is 353 MB. Everything else is tied up by the OS. Adding an 8 GB or 16 GB MicroSD card would be best for storing music, photos and videos, and off-loading some apps and app data (that support off-loading to removable flash, not all do). The battery is reported as being a LiFe battery, which is lithium-iron-phosphate (LiFePO4). If true, that's impressive. LiFe is a high performance and capacity technology with a long cycle life (up to 2000 cycles, or 3-4 times that of lithium-ion). Such batteries are extremely safe; they will not explode or catch fire if over-charged or short-circuited. They can also be charged very rapidly, and can last 5+ years. So, if I can trust what the Android System App is telling me, I'm impressed. The display is 800 x 432, 60 Hz refresh, with a 160 dpi display density. It is very readable, and bright. I am running mine at 40% brightness. The CPU shows as being an ARM v7 running at 1008 MHz. The clock rate is variable; it will range between 60 and 1008 MHz automatically to reduce power drain - the OS does this automatically.Some things it does not have: obviously, no mobile networking support, only WiFi. So, you need to be in a WiFi hotspot to access the Internet (which is getting easier and easier in so many public places). There is no GPS. There is no rear-facing camera for taking photos, just the front facing camera for making video calls (that seems like an oversight to me, because a 5MP phone camera would be cheap to add). There is no Bluetooth, and no way to add it. None of these things are show-stoppers in my opinion for a $70 tablet, but would be nice if tablet designers could make some of this stuff available as modular user upgrades.Bottom line - this tablet is worth the price. Best $70 I've spent in a while.", "Date": "December 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Starter Tablet", "Author": "Lishai", "ReviewID": "R17OA01F0IUGOT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased product for my kids and I love it. My husband and I have the Samsung Galaxy 10.1 so we were looking for something very similar but smaller for the kids. This is the closest by far to the high end tablets for a great price. I love how it runs off the play store, many we have looked at were Android but they ran off of the \"get jar\" market and didn't have much like the play store does. I recommend this product to everyone looking for and affordable tablet.", "Date": "November 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Great Value. Glad I found it.", "Author": "lj", "ReviewID": "RC3E67V4P6KGW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "***UPDATED*** 11/18/13I promised I would update this review as time went on. This tablet has officially died. It will not turn on or charge no matter what I try.I still stand by my earlier statements that this is a good \"value\" purchase and/or entry tablet for young kids. Although you would expect things to last more than a year. I haven't looked into what the warranty is but I'm sure we're past it. It has served its purpose for us and I will be buying a better tablet later on to replace this one.If you know your expectations and you want a tablet that is cheap for young kids who may be rough on them, I recommend this tablet as long as you are not expecting more than a year and can deal with the issues I listed below.Otherwise, I would officially change my recommendation to a \"Do not buy,\" or Buyer beware. If you are looking for a Nexus/Galaxy/iPad type experience, keep looking.***UPDATED*** See below original review***I just bought this for my son for Christmas and it came in the mail today. It has an expandable micro sd card slot (TF)and most people will probably need it. (Keep reading) I bought this one: SanDisk microSDHC 8GB Class 2 Card with SD Adapter (SDSDQ-8192). I've always found Sandisk to be pretty reliable. The onboard memory states 4 gb but the available memory was about 1gb so keep that in mind if it's important to you. Memory cards are dirt cheap and can easily get you where you want cheaper than going the \"other\" route.I took the pad out to play with it some. It comes installed with Angry Birds, Netflix, Facebook, Fruit Ninja, Play Store, Adobe flash player and of course your regular items (wallpaper, camera, clock widget, browser, wifi, etc.)Some have said the packaging had a knockoff look. A better choice of words would be that it has \"generic\" packaging. It's not a ripoff or knockoff which connotes images of backstreet deals from some guys trunk. That's not a fair assessment of this product. The instruction booklet is admittedly small but who needs an instruction booklet to run a tablet?My only concerns are that it withstands the test of time and the 10 year old. It seems well built. (One minor design flaw is the screen and the outer frame aren't flush with each other so there is a gap. It will definitely collect dirt and be hard to get out.) Not a deciding factor but I can see it getting on my OCD nerves. The camera is also average at best but I never understood why people needed a great camera for a tablet. (Is a tablet really going to be your go to camera for things like vacation?)We bought this for our 10 yr old son. As such I think it's important for people to understand what this tablet competes with. It would be a mistake to compare this to the iPad for both good and bad reasons.It isn't in competition with the iPad but rather the iPod touch. We went with this instead of the iTouch and saved a lot of $. It was $69 for a 4gb Android tablet (expandable to 32) vs. $199 for a 16gb iTouch (not expandable.)I think we made the right choice and I think he will like it. Good luck everyone. Be smart.I will update this review after Christmas when the tablet sees regular daily use.****UPDATE***It's always good to come back and reevaluate a product after the newness has worn off and you can think more objectively. My overall feeling on the tablet hasn't changed much. I would still recommend it to the target audience that I mentioned above. Again, if you are looking for a backup to your laptop or an alternative to an iPad, this probably isn't for you. But for those who have read the description and know what you're getting, this will still be a great product.Here are my impressions over the past week of regular use:Screen: I start with the screen because at first I was turned off by the screen. It is more of a durable plastic. However when I go to my Galaxy tablet and come back to it I am glad for the build and glad that my kids have the Zeepad. It's perfect for them.As such you should know though that it will probably show marks. I'm fine with that. After all it comes with a stylus. The screen protector that comes with it is lacking and we have been looking (unsuccessfully for some that will fit it). Screen protectors for a 7\" tablet Do NOT fit the Zeepad. It is slightly smaller than 7\" so keep that in mind. Also finding a case has been a bit challenging. Universal cases that hold the corners cause it rub against the power button (which may be a design flaw). Nevertheless none of these things would cause me to fret.While I am glad that the screen is durable, others may be turned off of it if they are used to the high glossy, colorful screens. The Zeepad will look dull in comparison but again who are you buying it for?One other issue that has given me pause is the wifi. It works great but it can be quirky at times. One time it was turned off and after selecting on it would immediately turn off again. It would continue to do this until we finally shut it down. After a little while it worked fine. Maybe this was a one time thing. It happens. Also the clock constantly reverts itself to January 1, 1970. I don't know the significance of that date (LOL) but I finally solved this by checking the setting to sync the clock with the network when connected to wifi. Again, maybe this is an isolated event.The battery: I would take off a 1/2 star for the screen build and another 1/2 star for the battery. It definitely doesn't seem to last long but kids do forget to charge things. If you travel a lot this could be an issue for you. You might get a converter to get around this. (Finding a car charger might be difficult. The AC power cord is of the small, round variety.)One last thing: the memory. I said in my original review that the memory issue (comes stock with around 1GB available) could be worked around with a memory card. That is still technically true but in reality it has proven a little more difficult to run apps solely from the memory card. This could be an Android limitation as I am still new to the Android ecosystem. There is an app called App to SD which has made it a little more simpler but I am still not sure that it frees much space on the tablet. There are simply some games that you won't be able to play on this tablet. (So far it seems to be the racing games: Need for Speed, Asphalt, etc.) These use a lot of memory.While it may seem that I have changed my mind on this tablet because of these comments, in reality I haven't. I still consider it a good purchase and the proof of that is the recipient still enjoys it and loves it. However I wanted to be thorough for those who were still thinking of purchasing. All things considered I would still rate this a solid 4 star product and worth the risk if you understand who the target audience is and should be and also temper your expectations in regards to other similar products.PS - Just FYI. A lot of people are leaving negative reviews on this product because of shipping issues. Please read the reviews and find out if this product is for you. I am sad that others had shipping problems. Ours arrived in good time, from West coast to East coast during Christmas rush. Research the seller. There are probably some drop shippers used by Amazon that have nothing to do with the company that makes them. I have seen 2 or 3 different sellers to these.Hope this helps.**BATTERY UPDATE**Some users have experienced issues with the battery. I have monitored this with my son and we have come to the conclusion that the battery life is approximately 2-3 hours. It seems to be about 2.5 hours on average. This is basically Minecraft (which is all he plays) and nothing else. We have monitored it with low power usage apps and received about the same results. In short, you would be fortunate to get over 3 assuming all tablets are the same and this is the norm for these batteries.There was also an issue with the charger. It sometimes prefers certain outlets. Some outlets won't charge it correctly. I am assuming this is an adapter issue since we live in the USA. The adapter seems generic and I am currently trying to find a backup just in case.This still doesn't change much from my initial review but I wanted to keep the review updated. I always appreciated it when people would continue to be open minded toward their products and let others know how it was going.The battery issue may be disappointing to some but as I said above, it really all depends on who you're buying it for. My son has learned to work around it by keeping it charged and in all honesty kids need limits anyway. Long car trips could pose a problem but a converter would do the trick.", "Date": "December 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Buyer Beware - This is a worse than bad SCAM", "Author": "Always Already \"Avid Reader\"", "ReviewID": "R2A9TL4NZY9ZAX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "How can something be worse than bad you might ask. I ordered this product on Jan 24, 2013 from Amazon. I was told it would be shipped from China and I could expect a longer delivery time.  It finally arrived on Feb 26. The tablet did turn on but could NOT be charged.  I was told by Amazon that I would have to contact the seller.  The seller responded that I would have to ship the item back to China at my expense which I did ship it back and kept my proof of mailing and it cost another $30.96.  I shipped it back on March 1, 2013.  It is now May 1, 2013 and the seller via email keeps telling me they will refund my money (less $30.96) \"as soon as they receive the item\".  Well, guess what? After 60 days I do not believe they will ever receive the item.So this is how it can be worse than bad.  Amazon will do nothing and the seller will do nothing and I have lost my original purchase price plus another $30.96 so that I might be able to participate in this scheme.

But I'm certainly glad I took the risk. Considering I wanted this device mostly as an e-reader, the tablet would be worth the price even if all it i did was respond to touch and read PDF's. But it does a lot more. The right thing to do is to not have high expectations. I mean, after all, it's incredibly inexpensive. But I am honestly surprised as to how functional this tablet is.I'll start by listing the cons to get them out the way:-Ports and jacks quality: poor(Some of the physical ports, like the AC and micro USB may not align perfectly. You may need to push hard.)-UI virtual movement response: seldom slight lag.(The UI response lag is slightly noticeable at times, but not significant. Most of the time it responds very well, you have to be very picky to care for a few hundred milliseconds)-Bluetooth: None-Technical Support: Poor/Non-existentNow for the Pros:-Android 4.0 : Excellent OS & UI-Rooted!: Root access enabled(You'll be able to install apps that require root access)-Graphic processing: Impressive(I was able to play Raging Thunder 2, Angry birds Starwars, and some other demanding games without any lag)-G-Sensor: Yes-Display and touch response: Good(The display is much better than others have described it. The touch response is on point)-Micro USB OTG: Allows you to plugin many common USB devices (have tried Flash drives, Mice, Keyboards)-Included Bonus: Ear buds, Micro USB to OTG cable, Screen protector(perfect fit), USB to PC cable, Tablet Pen.Other observations & comments:-The device comes with a proprietary charger, which I thought was kinda lame, until I discovered you can also charge the device using any Micro-USB charger (Recommended use: 5v - 2A).-No micro HDMI (Oh well)-Google Voice recognition works great at a fair distance.-Running: ES File Explorer with LAN file management - Good, Android VNC client - Good, Fling - Good, Google Play - No limitations, SuperUser - Good, ConnectBot - Good, AutoKiller - Good, Terminal Emulator - Good, Tasker - Limited.", "Date": "January 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "AWESOME affordable tablet", "Author": "A friendly helper", "ReviewID": "R2MQFNS4QOWYK6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is one of the best buys i have gotten.

I was pleasantly surprised though. This little tablet is very responsive, the build quality is pretty good, and it even has expandable memory (which my more expensive tablet does not). I bought this as a xmas gift for my girlfriend and overall I'm really happy with it. My only real gripe with it is the screen, but for the price I can't complain. There's no dead pixels or anything, you can kinda just tell the screen is cheap based on viewing angles and quality of images. It's really not that bad though and again, for $80 what do you expect. I especially like the size of this device. It's nice and compact and fits easily in my sweatshirt pocket but yet it's still big enough to where you can set it down and watch something on it.

It is not fancy, not top of the line. It has a low quality feel to it, however, do not be fooled. This is a very good tablet to do your daily things, without having the fear to break your $200-$500 tablet.Let me mention some of the pros and cons of this machine, and this is my personal observation.Pros:For the price, it is pretty rugged and well made, you won't break it easily (but do not test it :-))It has Google Play apps, which is important.It is not large, can fit into a large pocket, or holder.Battery life is considerably long and that makes it great for travel.Easy to touch by finger and price is very affordable.Cons:The volume does not go to levels that you could hear some stations, prepare to use headphones in some cases.No GPS is installed in this machine, map directions cannot be used on road.App pages are limited, but it still isn't bad.Camera quality is very basic. Do not expect to have high quality pics.Overall, I am very happy with this tablet so far. It is an affordable machine, and you get what you pay for. I also have a Samsung S2 which is much higher in quality on all levels. But hey, this is a machine that if you break, it won't break your heart with it.

I downgraded the stars because the micro usb port was DOA. I wouldn't even have noticed except my son bought a keyboard case for her which plugs into the port.

They both work fine. Download of Apps is easy and the apps it comes with are very cool and all work.Reviews mentioned batery issues, some things we noticed and settings we changed that helped extend the battery run time considerably are as follows: When you first get the Zeepad the instructions say to charge them for six hours before the first use. Make sure and do that but when you connect the charger the plug that goes into the tablet will not go all the way in until the plug dissapears into the charger input so don't try to force it all the way in. When it \"clicks\" it's in as far as it can go. There will be a little of the silver part of the plug still visible that does not go into the tablet charger port. If you force it you might damage the unit.  After the first charge the instructions say charge for only 4hours. Do not overcharge and it would be good to set a timer so that you don't over charge the battery. The battery it comes with can be charged and discharged over 2 thousand times but it does not like to be over charged. Also don't not store the unit with a 100% charge for long periods of time, these new batteries like to be stored with 50-40% power only. If they are left to sit for a long time with 100% charge it can damage the structure of the batteries.  Rune time: The main killer of the battery run time is,  the screen brightness. Lower it as the screen is super bright and at only 7 inches they cannot build it with a very large battery. Leaving the screen on the super bright setting eats the batteries pretty quickly. The next big juice hog is the wifi. If yu are not going to be downloading apps, surfing or sending e-mails turn on airplane mode which turns off wiifi. Leaving the wifi on all the time keeps the table searching for the wifi signal and commnicating back and forth with the source and that eats the battery. Once you set it up and are using game apps ( what most kids do ) you dont need the wifi for them while they play apps anyway. If you do these two things the battery should last a bit over 2-2-1/2 hours on a 4 hour charge. Not bad. I wont get into the tech aspects as others have covered that pretty well in other reviews but considering these cost a lot less than other brands the main thing I was concerned with was, if it actually did what they were supposed to do. They both have worked fine and side by side to a samsung galaxy they donwloaded apps at just about the same speed as any other andriod tablet or i phone. The build quality is pretty good considrng the price. If you are looking for some \"special ops\" military grade hardware this is not the unit for you but if you need something to use daily under normal conditions these are pretty nice. The tablets are impressive and are worth the money. They come from overseas so shipping is not super fast. If you need them for a birthday order with plenty of time to give them a chance to ship from the factory.  If something goes wrong I will update this review but so far, these little tablets has been a very good purchase and the kids love them. Hope this info helps, The battery is not an issue but I addressed that more as most of the negative reviews had to do with them and that was the main thing I worried about when I ordered them.

There was also a micro USB cable included and we used that to charge the systems for a while but that quit working.

I would spend the money on the more expensive ones.**UPDATE: I decided to contact the manufacturer because it was still under warranty. They told me they would fix the tablet but I had to pay to ship it to them and pay to have it returned back to me. So I basically would be paying more for the tablet then I already have.

I will say they run and work great WHILE THEY LAST. They can not take any wear and tear at all. So lets start with zeepad number 1 I ordered it got it in good time wanted to get it charged and set up before she opened it so she could play right away. I open it put it on to charge and it wont charge unless I prop  it  on something to put pressure on it. I should have sent back right away but I ordered it late and party was next day figured I could give to her and see if it was just outlet. After one week it would not charge at all. So I send back get a new one. I get it charges fine so i think ok other one just bad but after 2 weeks it will not charge you have to fiddle with charger to get it to light then another few days will not charge at all So I send back again to get the THIRD ZEEPAD. The third time the charger just fell inside after 3 weeks use. So after the last time I said screw this  go on another site find a kindle fire for 70 dollars got it and have had it 6 months now. Do not buy this product it may work great the first month but after that it WILL break and if u pass the warranty you are out of luck. There are times you can find good deals where you pay cheap price but get a great product. This is not one of those products you get what you pay for on this one. You are better off spending a bit more and getting something that will last. This not worth it. Yes I know I was only spending like 60-70 dollars on a tablet so I cant expect the world. I didn't want to spend 300-400 on a top of the line product for a 7 year old to play on so I just went with this and like I said I cant expect a product that will last years but 3 of these in like 2-3 month is bad she only got about a month all together of play time because a lot of this was shipping back then you wait for them to get bad product before they ship new one. So she got a little over a month on all 3 and after the second one I made sure I was the only one charging it just to be sure it was not her being ruff on it. I was only one charging it was so careful and still charger problem. Just wanted to give everyone a warning because I was so disappointed she was so excited to get one and I was happy to get her one and I was let down.

The packaging screams cheap but that's to be expected with an 80.00 tablet.  what was not expected was the inability to play music, it does play... 60 seconds after you click a button in Google Music and once it's started you cannot stop it for another 60 seconds, the point is this is ridiculously slow, even after removing everything installed on it. Displaying album art is non existent as well as even the song names.  if you click out to look at another album, you better go brew a coffee and take a shower, it might be ready when you get back.  This was not a symptom of Google's app either as all the other music players I tried had the same issues.On top of that turning it on and off is a problem, after it goes into sleep you have to hold the button for 30-60 seconds for it to reboot, it will not turn back on after it shuts down the screen like all other tablets do.  I read some of the reviews and unless I got a bum tablet I cannot see how anyone can get this to work properly, there is no way anyone can function by clicking a button and waiting 30 seconds for something to happen.Try it, think \"click\" in your head and then count to 30. that's how long it takes to respond when an app is open.I cannot say how it plays games but if a simple MP3 is any indication this is not worth 8 dollars let alone 80.I would not give this item to my worst enemy... or wait, maybe I would...We should have sent Osama a few of these in 2001, we'd have found him in the same cave still trying to power it on.Update 01/20/2013: after looking at this thing siting in the box waiting for the return I decided to try one thing, I forgot that I did not erase my google credentials so I opened it and did a \"reset\".Oddly enough, now the thing is snappy enough to play the music and show albums and turn on and off properly, not sure what did it and it doesn't change my rating but it now works for my purpose  So if you get a sluggish unit, try resetting it in the settings of the device.", "Date": "January 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Waste of money", "Author": "Rory Cockerline", "ReviewID": "R2BYZ26CTA2D5P", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I thought this would be a good tablet to buy for my daughter.

You have to push hard to get anything on the screen, but it skip lines most of the time... very frustrating, as if I'm writing a secret formula of some sort or an alien writing an unknown language from outer space.What's irony, is that the seller (Goodios) want's to charge me a re-stocking fee if I return it (that was the first threat when I contacted them after a week), as if I was rough with it or I'm gonna return it with missing parts. They didn't even bother to offer and pay for the postage. I didn't want to go through that cause some companies will find anything wrong with anything to avoid paying you the full amount, and I dealt with those dishonest once before. I tried to hold on to it and made it work properly, but to no avail (it was totally a lemon and I kept telling them that... still they never offer to pay for the postage). I didn't like the tablet anymore cause of those issues, and the brand was faulty. I bought it cause it had some favorable reviews on that tablet and the stylus to use, but mine was a mistake, a total crap, and the seller was a total jerk for threatening me...

My wife and I debated getting our 4 year old a LeapPad for educational games, but I was able to win out by pointing out the cost of many Android games: free.The screen has a small viewing angle and the resolution isn't the best, my daughter loves playing the ABC and puzzle games we downloaded for her. I have not purchased any software for her, but the free games on Play are awesome. This thing even runs Candy Crush (just in case you were wondering :).I wish this didn't have a proprietary charging end on it (it has a USB port, but that is not for charging) but my other tablets also have proprietary charging ports so it seems to be standard for them to make a different port.The box was full of goodies: charging cable, usb adapter (so you can plug in full sized usb items to the tablet), a stylus, AND a screen protector. They really delivered on the packaging.This tablet is really a bargain for the price, it wont win any processor speed awards and it can hang at times but if you are in the same boat and looking for something to entertain your children during long drives or you want to use some type of electronic game/learning system this is priced to be in your top 5 list of purchase considerations. On the other hand, if you are an adult looking for something to surf the web/look for jobs/ do any type of professional work with, I would suggest a different more powerful (and likely expensive) tablet.Willie-B", "Date": "June 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for kids", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"JT\"", "ReviewID": "R1HJVM1FB2GU6G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is great for my grandson with downs syndrome.

So they have been through more than six months of regular use. For $70 these are pretty good. They are definitely not iPads, Google Nexus, or Samsung Galaxies, but they are a good buy for your average 4 to 8 year olds. At this point, three of the four are still working and two of the four are working well. They work well for playing games, reading ebooks, watching movies, or taking silly (albeit low quality) pictures of oneself. They do all this just as well a Nexus.About two months ago one the tablets stopped charging, the battery still had a small charge (not enough to power up) and the charger was working. Something stopped working in the charging circuits on the motherboard. So that one is no longer usable.All but one of the chargers has stopped working, I think the wire or plug is too weak and broke, they worked if you wiggled the plug. Also the charging receptacle in the tablets is weak, one tablet's does not work anymore. And the USB port of another does not work. This has probably as much to do with the kids jamming and yanking on the cord, as anything.Fortunately, the USB connector does charge the tablet, so even without any of the chargers you can still use the tablets.The third tablet is very slow to react when tapping on the screen. This is most noticeable on the home screen, but also when playing games, though not as bad.Very odd, seems more of a software based problem than hardware.The fourth tablet, so far (knock on wood) is working fine no problems at all. Battery life has never been that great, two hours or so max. It hasn't diminished in six months so they are good quality, just not that big. Keep a smart phone charger on hand and they will last as long as you've got gas in the car.Overall, I am pleased with these tablet. Especially for younger kids, when you don't want to throw a lot of money down the drain (literally!) Trust me, I know, before they got these, my wife's Nexus, ended up in the toilet when two kids tried to grab it at the same time. Fortunately, it still works fine.We know they can take care of them now, so we will upgrade them one at a time, as they stop working. So far only one has had to be replaced.

There are no set parental controls on it, but my husband went on google and manually set controls for graphic material. So you can set controls it just takes a bit to do.

(Just wanted to say that before anyone jumps down my throat) Bought for my mom, who has cancer and lives with me. I handled it mostly to help her set it up and we noticed problems right off the bat. We weren't expecting anything fancy, but to work and be able to get some use out of it would have been appropriate for the price paid I think. We charged it to full first thing, set it up a little bit, turned it off with the charge at 74 percent and turned it back on 30 minutes later to discover the battery had completely drained. To our disappointment, it does that every time. The touch screen is unresponsive at times especially in certain areas, you have to press really hard and sometimes even then it does not respond. There are specks in the back of the lcd screen, enough to be bothersome when using. My mom is too polite to want to return it when I mentioned it she said no, she already threw out the box it came in anyways and said it'll be alright and she feels bad. At first it was extremely slow to charge, taking hours to just get even halfway, and sometimes after it has been charged all the way and she disconnects the charger the full charge goes right back down to only a barely charged within seconds without doing anything. I have been trying to contact amazon's customer service, I remember years ago they had the best customer service if ever there was a problem, now I can't even get ahold of them. I don't have a phone with minutes right now but have been trying to submit their online forms and have been getting a \"We're sorry. There was an error trying to send your e-mail. Please try again in a few minutes or contact us by phone.\" Message. I have been trying several times a day everyday, it doesn't look like they are fixing the form problem. I have scoured the internet for their customer service address but it seems like all of them have been disabled. Extremely disappointed with this product and with amazon's customer service, they lost a long time customer.

He is VERY rough with toys and anything that's electronic. I was hesitant to give him a tablet of any kind but he had shown great interest in using his mom's Kindle Fire (under her watchful eye!), including practicing reading skills, so I decided to go with a budget-priced tablet and get him one of his own. We are now at week 3 with his use of the Zeepad and so far, so good! He uses it daily for Netflix, Angry Birds and reading e-books. I estimate he's put at least 80 hours of use into the tablet and it still functions perfectly.I was VERY pleased with the quality of the video, given the price range. I was expecting Netflix movies to appear blocky and lo-res looking but that's not at all the case. I'm very pleased with the overall performance of this tablet. I've had no problems logging into Google Play and installing new apps. Keep in mind - this tablet is NOT going to set speed records. Yes, there are lag times in contrast to higher priced tablets but we're talking maybe 1 to possibly 5 seconds (Netflix in particular can take several seconds to boot up). But once an app is up and running, we've had no performance problems.One BIG caution. The battery life is very short before recharging is required. He usually just stays plugged in (you can charge and use the device at the same time) to avoid having the tablet shut down during a record-breaking Angry Birds game. I estimate the battery life is 2 to 2.5 hours tops.If you are able to cope with the short battery life, I highly recommend the Zeepad for kids and for anyone who is looking for a low-priced tablet.", "Date": "April 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "GREAT!!!", "Author": "Stephanie Starling", "ReviewID": "RYXUHR4KV71IL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We purchased this for our 3 year old because she loves to play on our phones.

I was hopeful when it displayed a green battery - but instantly it turned red, and powered off.I tried to connect with the micro usb to usb cord.  It did turn on momentarily with a logo, then immediately shut down.The bottom edge border of the tablet seemed raised, and when I pressed on it, it clicked into place.  Hoping this helped with the alignment, I tried to attach the power source again.The green battery light appeared only for an instant, when I moved it on to a table to charge.  This made the powersource lose a solid connection and again this red battery light appeared.I'm very disappointed.

Battery life isn't great, but it uses the same micro USB as the cell phones we have, so finding a charger and cable is no problem around the house.  Added a 16 GB memory chip, so the Zeepad is loaded with videos, talking books, epub books, and handles all well.

We have a 5 year old boy and a 10 year old girl. Upon reading other reviews that these might be somewhat fragile, we have drilled into the kids that they need to be gentle with them. In general, these work just like a Droid smart phone and last a couple of hours before they need to be recharged. As we don't really want the kids playing games longer than this, we are fine with the batter life. The Google Play Store works just like on a smartphone and we have had no issues with this or using the wifi. I added a couple of leftover mini SD cards I had from old smart phones to increase the storage space for the kids.The only issues we have had with these tablets have all been in with either the original seller (not Goodios) or the quality control of the product. We originally ordered these 15 days before christmas to be from Santa. These never arrived, Amazon refunded our money and that company is no longer in business. Beware of the folks with the cheapest price. We then re-ordered these from Goodios who have been perfect in solving our problems. Our first set of these arrived and one of them was dead on arrival. It was quickly replaced with another that had a bad charger. We had a new charger within a couple of days and then found out the little USB connector was also defective. They sent us one of those and now everything works fine.We got the little USB keyboards that double as covers which work fine with one exception. When the Zeepad is in the case and the case is turned vertically the Zeepad can slip out of the little claws that hold it in. As these cases are all made the same I will put either double sided tape or some velcro on ours to keep this from happening.We really like these tablets and they kids have been using them up everyday when they get home from school for over a month. If Zeepad improved their quality control we would have had no issues with them at all. The 4 stars are because of this.

All were about 85% charged.  Each Zeepad connected to my wi-fi home network in a matter of seconds.  Touch screen was responsive and a breeze to navigate.  I am pleasantly surprised with the overall build quality and remarkable functionality of the Zeepad.While not as fast as the Google Nexus 7, which has a hotter Arm Holdings designed processor, the Zeepad's speed is quite adequate.  I was drawn to the Zeepad since its processor is also an Arm design and the Android operating system is tough to beat.  Image or screen quality is inferior to the Nexus but decent.  The difference can be noticed when viewing the screen from an angle, but as long as the view of the Zeepad is straight on, the quality is good, not great.  To put the review in perspective, remember the Zeepad is well below $100 and, at this price point, I think this product is a real value.  Actually, it is a remarkable surprise.  My grandkids opened these on Xmas Eve and within seconds were connected to the net and gazing at more apps (mostly free games) on GooglePlay, where android apps are offered in abundance.  Did not experience any slowness as mentioned in some reviews.  Perhaps the network? Durability is an unknown since we have had the Zeepads for just few days so I'll follow up in a month or so.

The first sign that this was not going to go well was the way it was packaged...or the lack of packaging.  LOL.  The tablet comes in the box that you would find it in any retail store, then it had only one layer of bubble wrap covered by a layer of packing tape. What kind of a company packs like this???  (it is not packed into a shipping box).It only gets worse, the screen is extremely scratched, and raised above the frame on one side, and it had a half worn sticker on it.  The WIFI must be within 2 feet in order to connect...but the browser doesn't work anyway.  Also the unit will not charge at all if the tablet is turned on.Despite all this we were able to download a couple of games that did work well and were a ton of fun at first, that is until they started to freeze up.I contacted the company on the 18th, and they responded back saying the item is new and \"show us a photo where is the scratches.thanks!\".  So I replied back with pictures.Next they agreed it was scratched and offered to send me \"the film\" to repair it and a new charger.There is so much wrong with this Zeepad that a screen and a charger wouldn't come close to fixing it.  I replied back that I did not pay full price for a used, disfunctional tablet that I would have to fix.Their last response was just one short sentence...\"pls ship back we refund you.thanks\"Evidently they also want me to pay to ship this useless, previously returned item.  It is so disappointing.

For the money it is not a bad product and my daughter enjoyed it for her first tablet. But what are the chances that she would set a password and forget later on without any way to reset it? With the slide lock after 3 tries it did give the option to override and we were able to get in. With the password however, I tried over 300 combinations and never got the option to open with my google account. I saw many other sites with the same complaint but never found an answer. Nor was I able to find the manufacturer info to call and ask if there was a way to reset the tablet. So I sent it back and will try another brand.", "Date": "February 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Waste of money!", "Author": "Laura Harwick", "ReviewID": "RYOOB02RWH9KN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this tablet for my son for Christmas.

Although it took some tinkering in the settings, eventually I got it to unfreeze enough to download apps. (Instructions indicated doing something, but the print is so small and pictures even smaller that even with 20/20 vision I couldnt figure out what it said). The touch pad isn't always all that responsive...but for the most part, it's good enough for a 12 year old. I wasn't using the stylus that comes with it at the time..but perhaps the response from the touch screen would have been slightly better if it had.Ran into some issues of it 'not responding' and not accepting my request to shut the system off to try and fix the problem - eventually I did get it to come out of it's funk and it worked just fine. But it does freeze a bit. Runs a little slow, but with only 512MB of Ram, I chalk that up to the fact it's been a while since I've worked with something with such a slow processing speed.It's a decent reader - the kid prefers the weight and size compared to that massive Nook she got from another relative for Christmas. The fact that it is PINK is possibly the biggest plus. It does run most Google Play apps - so that is a plus since they are mostly free.  The front facing camera is pretty poor quality, so that feature for Skype is there, but know it's about as good as webcams from 10 years ago. If you're kids aren't very patient - might not be for them as it does seem to freeze if you're scrolling through the screens...but I like it over all and would even buy myself one for the reader alone.", "Date": "December 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Satisfied", "Author": "HappyMom", "ReviewID": "R2WKR04QRHS1SZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Product arrived today.
