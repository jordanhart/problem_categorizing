[...]For those who are looking at getting the best tablet out there at the moment, this is the one you should be looking at.My profile: Heavy tablet users for personal and business purposes.  I work on my tablet around 4-5 hours a day (Email / Documents / Spreadsheet / PDF ) and use it 1-2 hours for personal use such as watching movies or reading books/magazine.  Tablet is my go-to device for all internet related search I do.I have the following and/or used the following before:1) iPad 12) iPad 23) iPad 44) iPad Mini5) Kindle Fire6) Kindle Fire HD7) Kindle Fire HD 8.98) Asus Transformer with Keyboard9) Nexus 7 First Gen10) iPad Air 16gb WifiAs you can see, I been through many devices and hope this review with my experience helps users decide if this is the right device for them. This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this next year.  For comparison sake, I will use last year's Kindle and iPad mini as they are the closest size to this HDX 7\"Speed (9/10):This is leaps and bounds faster than last year Kindle HD.  Last year Kindle struggles to go through any HD video content I put in.  This year's HDX able to play seamlessly all the HD 1080p contents I added.  It is incredible how much the 2.2Ghz quad processor improved vs last year's model Dual 1.2Ghz.Screen (9/10):This is the biggest improvement over last year's model.  The screen is in true HD 1080p (1920x1080).  This means any HD content I throw at it will view in its intended resolution.  The screen is crystal clear (much better than iPad mini) and the viewing angle is incredible.  I have this Kindle hanged in the middle of the car and at any seat it is view very clearly.  Last year's model was not as clear as this.  This is excellent for my minivan with my kids watching all the HD movies.  The brightness of the screen is also much brighter than last year's modelSound(8/10):The sound system in this Kindle Fire HDX is using Dolby Digital Plus with virtual 5.1 surround sound.  That gives this device a much better surround sound then previous generation's.Build (8/10):This HDX is more \"angular\" than last year's device.  It's slightly rougher to hold in the corners than last year's model due to sharper edges though I doubt any users will hold their tablet by their corners.  The device is noticeable lighter (395g for Kindle Fire HD vs 303g for Kindle Fire HDX).  This mean you can hold this for longer time without fatigue.The power and volume button placement on this Kindle Fire HDX is interesting.  It is behind the device which allows it to hide away from front view.  However, this can cause user to accidentally hit the on/off button or the volume button when not being careful.  Aesthetically it is great but it is definitely not a practical solution when you are trying to use this on the go.It does look sturdy enough to survive minor drop but I highly recommend getting a case for it.  Those sharp corners seems more prone to dents than round corners for last year's model.Battery (6/10):This is probably the biggest drawback for this device.  The battery life is not as good as last year's model.  This is quite logical as last year's HD has a 4400mAh battery while running 720p while this HDX runs Full HD 1080p but runs only on a 4500mAh battery (only 100mAh more than last year).  The 1080p screen pulls a lot of power vs last year's model when the screen is on, especially when running HD videos.  I'm able to achieve 5 hours of heavy use compare to 7 hours for last year's Kindle Fire HD at medium brightness with Wi-fi on all the time.  I tend to bring around an external battery pack but prefer something that is integrated (like a battery case)Software & software compatibility (8/10):The amount of app is still lacking compare to App store or Play store but has been steadily increasing which is a great sign. Games and software boot time has increased noticeably and compatibility is not an issueSilk browser has definitely improved compare to last year's tablet with multiple tabs actually now usable on the HDX.  For last year's version, it is practically unusable after 2 tabs due to the lack of hardware resource on the tablet (especially when the website is not optimized for mobile use).  The HDX has no problem going through any webpages I throw at it.Hopefully more apps will be optimized to use quad core soon.  I'm guessing some of these apps are only optimized for last year's dual core.I haven't got the opportunity to use Mayday yet but will review about it once I get more update on this.Complimentary Accessories (3/10):For all smart devices, one of the most important time is the number of accessories available.  At launch, it is understandable the lack of accessories but productivity focus accessories such as integrated case/keyboard are missing at launch.  This is rather disappointing as it can be a powerful productivity device with the right accessories attached.  Also the lack of case selection is quite astonishing for a flagship product on Amazon.  Hope there will be more cases such as battery case (due to above battery problem) or rugged case come out soon.Price (9/10):I got the special offer model at 16Gb (lowest end model) and it is enough for me to use.  The special offer ads are not intrusive like last year's model and sometimes does reveal some items I want. Compare to the ipad mini, this is practically a steal.  For those with the Nexus 7, it is quite comparable in price.Conclusion in one sentence: Amazon's iPad mini killer (8.5/10)For people who are justifying if this is a good upgrade, I say YES to that.  The speed and screen difference alone is worth the upgrade.  The whole user experience just improve drastically with the HDX.It use to be, for Kindle Fire HD, you will trade low price for slow performance, stutter and lag.  It honestly makes you think twice if the price is really worth all that poor experience.For HDX, this is no longer the case.  You get both great price, great screen and great performance that surpasses iPad mini. To me, the HDX is seriously Amazon's iPad killer.  It really marks how well Amazon has done to make themselves a worthy competitor in the tablet market. I hope some software upgrade or battery pack can make this the ultimate road warrior!****************************Dec 23th 2013 - 2 months  update *********************************So I have been using between this HDX 7\" and the 8.9\" HDX.  I also been using an iPad Air 16Gb Wifi and here are some updates, particular on the negative points mentioned previously.App Store - not so refined still.  Downloading and Installing problem occursThe app store after 2 month is still a bit lacking.  There are some freebie deals during cyber monday which I jumped (who doesn't like free stuff?)but still nothing that either the Apple App store or Google Play don't have.  Amazon App store really needs some exclusive apps to become a \"must get\" device.Now comes the bad part - I tried to download Magic 2014 game (big fan of Magic the Gathering since teen) from the Amazon App Store and the HDX 7\" downloads this rather slowly.  In fact, I noticed that when it reaches 50% it drops back down to 30% and redownloads the package again!  Since I'm not in a rush I really have no issue with this re-download problem.  However, this can be problem to some people who have limited bandwidth per month and won't appreciate redownloading the same thing again 2 times (or more but I didn't catch that).Once it reaches 100%, the app store attempts to install the software.  It goes into \"Installing...\" state for a while (at least couple hours).  Knowing that there's something weird going on, I rebooted the HDX 7\".  Once I rebooted it, the software shows it was never downloaded!Perhaps there's some application specific problem with this game but this really shows a rather poor experience on the Amazon Kindle Fire HDX.  I would expect a brand new top of the line Kindle Fire HDX would have ironed out simple bugs such as this but clearly, the Amazon App Store have 2 things it needs to work on:1) If this is an application specific error, Amazon needs to proactively test this release on all their devices before allowing it on the Amazon App Store.  It's quite obvious if any Amazon App store guys have even tried to install this Magic 2014 game that it just won't install.  Literally half the reviews on the review complain about this2) For these buggy release, Amazon should proactively pull this application from the store - the experience that lead to all the hours of download and wasted bandwidth got the user nothing in the end.  I can imagine some users with capped bandwidth or using their cell data to download will be furious if they know an app less than 1Gb rack them couple Gb of download.App Store is a big part of Amazon's Kindle Fire ecosystem and poor experience such as this really deters client in continued use, especially when all Kindle Fire are locked down to Amazon software ecosystem.  When you cannot even use the Amazon software ecosystem, any excellent hardware that this machine has becomes inaccessible and worse of all, a waste of user time to figure out.Now most people may say this criticism is related to the game(in this case, Magic 2014).  I believe this is not the case.  The responsibility of Downloading and Installing of the Magic 2014 application belongs to the Amazon App Store (after all, it is Amazon App Store people who authorized this to be released in their store). I start to find all other game download and installation questionable and my own usage time in App store browsing and purchasing drops drastically.From the above download experience, I did attempt to find some help from Amazon.  Here is where the more problem arises.Mayday - speaking to rep reading off outdated troubleshooting guidesAfter noticing my Magic 2014 download is gone, I attempted to contact Amazon through the Mayday button.  It's really my first time using this function so I don't really have any prior experience in using it.My Mayday call was picked up by Hayley (if I recall).  You can see a big Amazon logo in the background beside the customer service rep and she looks pretty friendly.  I explained my situation with the App store problem to Hayley but it seems she wasn't able to help; therefore I got transfer to a \"Tech Advisor\".  This Tech Advisor can't be shown in the video camera and asks for my credentials.  She also made me explain the problem again which I explained to Hayley (I would have thought someone will note down my problem as I need to use couple mins to explain again).  She then pulls something that you expect from an Indian Call Center by asking me to disconnect my internet modem.  I find this rather funny as I mentioned this is a software specific problem with the installation and has nothing to do with my modem or Internet connection.  I also mentioned that I am running a server at home and pulling the modem disconnects it from the Internet which breaks other services I am running unintentionally.  She seems to be stuck so she forward me to another representative (which if I heard correctly, it is the app store support rep).Once I got connected to the 3rd rep, they ask me to check my tablet date and time (which is correct).  This rep later ask me to press on options that are not the screen.  I suspected this rep was reading off an old Fire OS troubleshooting guide as I recently updated the Fire OS system and that some options and buttons are changed.  Given the large amount of time spent and there's no resolution, I went to my iPad air and downloaded the game successfully in couple mins while still have Amazon on the Mayday call.  I informed the 3rd tech support of this and thank them for their time although there was no resolution in the end.I very much prefer having the game on my Kindle HDX as the 7\" is perfect to bring outside for quick game or two, but the amount of time spent on troubleshooting and resource wasted on this is honestly not worth my time.  I ended up having to play this game on the iPad Air larger screen but also paid for in app purchase because the game itself is very good.It's a good lesson to learn that the whole software user experience needs to be more streamline and fluid on the Kindle.  Amazon has done successfully in the physical good purchasing section of the kindle fire (in fact I spent thousands of dollars more on Amazon.com using the kindle fire than on PC and very satisfy with the results) and that if it can bring the same experience to the software app store just like the physical store, Amazon will have a winner here. I use my machine extensively for magazine reading / internet browsing but when it comes to app download, I currently have my doubts if it will be another bandwidth hog and a waste of time.Display - blue hue appears but not very apparentSome people ask if the blue hue appears on the edge.  I can notice this if I'm reading off a totally white page (like a ebook or magazine).  However it is not very noticeable and that your eyes will ignore it eventually.  After all, words or graphic don't appear on the edges of the screen.Battery life - Still needs work onAfter the OS update, there seems to be a slight improvement with the battery life.  However, still not enough for me to really go through the day without bringing an external battery charger pack along.  At the moment, I am still looking for a 2 in 1 case + battery solution but it is not available.  I hope this can be my daily driver but without the battery life, it may just be a brick by the afternoon.Purchasing on Amazon.com - becomes addictive (Could be good or bad for some people!)I realized my spending on Amazon went up considerable compare to last year thanks to this Kindle Fire HDX.  I will be browsing it online and have these items saved on screen, constantly reminding me to get it.  Amazon really done a good job at this and really met, if not, exceed their goal in getting users buying from kindle fire.  With last year fire, the browsing experience on Amazon.com was not nearly as fluid as this year's HDX.  This makes it hard to keep my attention and urge to buy.  For people who wants a good purchasing experience, this Kindle Fire HDX will surely provide that.  For ones who need to save money, you may want to get your finger off the buy button!My overall rating stays the same as Amazon keeps knocking off prices for these machines making it still the best bang for the buck.Apr 28 Update - Family Use----------------------------------------------Got my kids an extra Kindle Fire HDX 7\" for them to play with.  My HDX 7\" is still running well with all my Instant Video and newsstand subscription inside.Since my kids don't treat their new toys with much care, I went and got them and myself a zerolemon EVA Case on Amazon.  The case is useful for prevent dents and major falls on your Kindle.  Even with my Kindle, the top pantel where the speakers are started to peel off a bit (amazon used glue to assemble the speaker grille top panel).  Case works great for hiding some of the blemishes of the kindle fire hdx 7\"Overall still satisfied with my machine and frankly been the best bang for the buck tablet i ever have.As mentioned, I will update this review periodically.  Next time I will focus on physical wear and tear of the machine after couple more months and again on battery life (as all electronics have a diminishing battery duration throughout its course of use). [...] Thanks for reading!", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent 3rd-generation tablet that compares favorably to the competition", "Author": "NF", "ReviewID": "R2KVHBC7NMNOGU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the middle model of the three models that Amazon is shipping this year: the Kindle Fire HD, the Kindle Fire HDX (this tablet), and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\". This is the successor for last year's Kindle Fire HD but with an updated operating system and new features, a redesigned shell (with the power and volume control buttons more readily accessible), an absolutely amazing display, superb sound, an included power adapter, and the new Mayday feature. See http://www.amazon.com/review/RNH700DOM9WN3/ for my review of the Kindle Fire HD and http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YPITHVTYLCZT for my review of the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\".Update: Some users are reporting a bluish glow around the edges of the screen for the HDX. If you search on YouTube for HDX Blue Haze, you can find a video showing the issue. Amazon has updated their \"Learn More\" link with the following info:\"To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7\" at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20% improvement in power efficiency.\"\"As a result of using these blue LEDs, you may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. All displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy.\"If this is something that you think would bother you, I'd recommend taking a look at the YouTube video or taking a look at the HDX at a local Best Buy or office superstore. I've also uploaded a user image here of my HDX with a book loaded so that you can see the blue glow (http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B00DOPNO4M/).The Amazon tablets are primarily content consumption devices, best suited for connecting to the Amazon ecosystem, including videos, music, books, apps, and so on. With the free Prime trial subscription, you can check out the Prime Instant Video options and watch movies and shows at no charge for 30 days. For videos, music, and books, the Amazon selection is at or near the top of the list; for apps, much less so. 90% of the top 100 apps are available on Amazon.com, as well as 100,000 others, but that's only a small fraction of what is available with Google or Apple.It's not quite as bad as it sounds because, while the competition has ten times as many apps, most of those apps are, um ... how shall I put this ... less than stellar (look up Sturgeon's Law). If there are specific apps you need or want, you definitely should double-check before purchasing to make sure that they are available. The apps that will likely never become available on the Kindle Fire ecosystem are those apps that require Google services (i.e., anything that uses Google location services). One ameloriating factor is that it is possible to side-load most of the apps from the Google Play store onto an Amazon tablet and a web search on side-loading apps onto Kindle Fire will show dozens of websites with detailed instructions. If the app you are sideloading requires a Google service to work, though, it will not run on the Fire, even if you manage to successfully install it.Like the other Kindle Fire tablets, as well as the Apple iPad and the Google Nexus, the Kindle tablet line doesn't have a micro-SD slot, so the assumption is that you're consuming content from the cloud. This is fine when you're using your tablet with wifi; not so good when you're traveling and want to load up your tablet with content for the trip. If the latter is something you expect to do regularly, you might want to consider the 32GB or 64GB versions, or pay the additional price for the 4G version, which is available on the 7\" tablet for the first time. Also, if all of your content is on iTunes or on Google Play, you would have to side-load everything onto the tablet. As is true of Apple and Google tablets, there's no way to automatically connect to the cloud storage of the competition.Something new this year is the ability to download Prime Instant Videos. I verified that I can download Prime Instant Videos to my Kindle Fire HDX. However, that option is not available for all movies and TV shows. It looks like they had to get the permission of the studios and not all of them said yes. So, for example, I was able to download \"Casablanca\" but not able to download \"The Avengers\" even though both are part of the Prime Instant Video collection and both are available for free streaming.Update: Adding a bit from a reply in the comments: Amazon is clearly looking at the Enterprise market with this launch, at least based on the details they provide. They've added full accessibility support (required in order to get government contracts), will be bringing support for VPN and business printing, have a better email client with tighter integration to Exchange, and are including OfficeSuite for productivity. There are other productivity tools available in their app store, as well, although both Google and Apple, particularly the latter, have more options. When VPN support arrives, I'll definitely be taking a look, as it would be nice to not have to lug my laptop home every night.So how does this Kindle Fire HDX differ from the previous generation Kindle Fire HD?Display: 1920x1200 (323 ppi) vs 1280x800 (216 ppi). It's more than that, though, as the colors are richer, brighter, with better contrast. This display has been judged by many reviewers as the best in its class and I would have to agree. Amazon has also added technology to automatically adjust the contrast and brightness when viewing the tablet in bright sunlight. While there is definitely a noticeable improvement, this isn't what you need for reading on the beach. For that, you'll need an eInk reader like the Kindle Paperwhite.Sound: As far as I can tell, the sound is about the same. This was already one of the best-sounding tablets on the market, with Dolby stereo output and enough power to actually make it possible to listen to music or video without requiring headphones.Size and Weight: Noticeably lighter (10.7 oz vs. 13.9 oz) and noticeably smaller (7.3\" x 5.0\" x 0.35\" vs. 7.6\" x 5.4\" x 0.4\"). This is a comfortable tablet to hold one-handed, even for long periods of time.Processor: It's a *lot* faster (2.2GHz quad-core, top-of-the-line CPU, compared to 1.2GHz dual-core). This tablet is amazingly fast and smooth, with the fastest processor in its class. Every game I've tried on it has run smoothly, with no hesitations, slowdowns, or glitches. Scrolling through content is amazingly smooth and fast now, without the hesitations and occasional slowdowns of the previous generations.Build: A redesigned shell with power and volume control buttons that are easy to find! This is a solid build but the back of the shell is something of a fingerprint magnet. Since most of us will be buying a case to put the tablet in, that may not be an issue.Camera: If there is a difference between last year's camera and this year's, I'm not able to see it. It's a high-def camera suitable for video-conferencing or Skype. Like last year's model, there is no rear camera. If this is important to you, you'll need the 8.9\" version.HDMI Output: This is the one area where last year's model wins. Amazon has removed the HDMI out connector from its tablet line (but see the description above for details on how Amazon is providing a software solution for sharing your tablet screen on your television). No other tablet that I'm aware of has this functionality so if this is something you need, you should be able to purchase one of last year's models fairly cheaply.Battery Life: The same, at 11 hours. However, Amazon has added a special \"reading mode\" to the device, which they claim will extend the battery life to as much as 17 hours. I did not test this. For my own personal use, the battery life is adequate.Price: It's more expensive ($229 vs. $199) but this year they include a power adapter, which was a $20 extra last year, so the actual difference in price is $10. For what you're getting, that price increase is definitely justified.It has an updated OS and updated feature software (including the free unlimited Mayday customer support feature). The software updates include the ability to download some Prime Instant Videos to your device and watch them offline, enhanced accessibility, enhanced enterprise controls and features (so now it's better suited for office work), enhanced email client, enhanced parental controls, improved X-Ray features (now including lyrics for music, as well as additional information for both books and movies), integration with GoodReads (coming soon), and the like.Where I noticed the biggest difference was the home screen. The default view is still the carousel but if you swipe upward, you'll see a more traditional icon view. The \"Recommended for you\" display on the home screen is now smaller and much less obtrusive (and it can be turned off in the settings). Amazon has also added multi-tasking of a sort, where swiping up from the bottom of the screen while you're in an app shows you the 20 most-recently-used items from your home screen, so you can quickly switch from one app to another without returning to the home screen.There is also a left panel available on most screens (but not the home screen) and in some of the apps, with navigation links and settings to make it easier to navigate and control your tablet or to navigate within the app. If you tap the center of your display and then swipe left while you're reading a book, for example, you'll see a panel that shows you the table of contents, the About the Author link, the Sync to Furthest Page Read link, and so on.The Kindle FreeTime option and the parental controls are still among the best in the business. If you want a tablet for a child and want to control what they can access, how long they can use the tablet at any given time, and the like, Amazon has you covered.You can now also schedule \"Quiet Time\" on the tablet, where notification sounds and pop-up notifications are disabled, either on a temporary basis by simply pushing a button or on a scheduled basis. Frankly, I doubt I'll ever use this feature but if you're the type who likes to read or watch video until you fall asleep, it's kind of nice to be able to disable all sounds so that you don't get rudely awakened when, e.g., someone plays a new word in your Words with Friends game.Mayday: This is a huge gamble by Amazon and it will be interesting to see whether it pays off. This isn't a feature for a techie like me and I didn't use it (although I was sorely tempted). From the commercials, it's pretty amazing, particularly that you can get a live chat in a matter of a minute or less (Amazon's goal is something like 15 seconds, I believe, although I can't help wondering what will happen on Christmas Day!). If you're thinking of getting a tablet for a technophobe, the addition of this feature may make the Kindle Fire HDX your best choice.How does this tablet rank against the competition? There are really only two other tablets in its class currently: the Google Nexus 7 and the just-announced Apple iPad Mini with Retina Display.Display: All three devices have retina displays, with the 7\" HDX and the Nexus at 1920x1200 (323 ppi) and the 8\" iPad Mini at 2048x1536 (326 ppi). All three displays are stunning. Amazon claims that it has enhanced the ability to read the display in bright sunlight, something that's a problem for all such devices. While this wouldn't be my first choice to read by the pool (I'd pick the Paperwhite), I can testify that it is easier to view the display in bright sunlight than its predecessors.It's worth noting that the aspect ratio of the HDX and Nexus is 16:10 while the aspect ratio of the iPad Mini is 4:3. Where this matters is watching video. If you're watching an old television show, a 4:3 aspect ratio is fine. If you're watching a high-def movie, the 4:3 aspect ratio is going to leave large black bars on your screen and the video will be much more compressed than it would be on the HDX and Nexus. Apple chose to maintain backward compatibility with prior devices rather than moving up.Sound: The HDX has Dolby Digital Surround Sound; the Nexus has Frauenhofer Surround Sound; the iPad Mini has stereo sound. The iPad Mini also makes the same mistake that Amazon made in its first-generation tablet: putting both speakers on the same side (in this case, at the bottom of the tablet). If you're watching a video, you'll have the tablet turned sideways and the sound will all come from the same side. The HDX, in contrast, has the speakers placed perfectly for video watching.Networking: The HDX and the iPad Mini both have dual band, dual antenna (MIMO) Wi-Fi. The Nexus is dual band but not dual antenna. All things being equal, I would expect the Nexus to lag a bit behind the others in networking performance, particularly in areas where the connection is spotty.Size and Weight:HDX: 7.3\" x 5.0\" x 0.35\" and 10.7 oz.Nexus: 7.9\" x 4.5\" x 0.34\" and 10.24 oz.iPad Mini: 7.87\" x 5.3\" x 0.29\" and 11.68 oz.There's really nothing to choose from here. All three are small, thin, and light. The iPad Mini is the heaviest but it also has a slightly larger screen.Processor:HDX: 2.2 GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor, 2GB memoryNexus: 1.5GHz quad-core Snapdragon S4 Pro, 2GB memoryiPad Mini: 64-bit dual-core A7, 1GB memoryThe HDX and iPad come out ahead of the Nexus on processing power while the HDX and Nexus come out ahead of the iPad Mini on memory. The A7 is only a dual-core processor but according to some tech sites that have run benchmarks, it definitely holds its own against the quad-core Snapdragon. These are all pretty powerful tablets.Cameras: Both the Nexus and the iPad Mini have 1.2 MP front and 5MP rear cameras. The HDX only has a front-facing camera. If you expect to take pictures with your tablet, the HDX isn't for you.Battery Life: HDX = 11 hours (17 hours when reading); Nexus = 9 hours; iPad Mini = 10 hours. Amazon wins this one, particularly if you will be spending a lot of time reading.Expansion: None of them have a microSD slot; they all assume that you'll be using their respective cloud systems.Parental Controls: All of them have the basic parental controls that allow you to limit your child's access to content, purchases, the web, and so on. Amazon goes farther, though, with the Kindle Free Time and Kindle Free Time Unlimited options, the latter of which is an inexpensive subscription to a curated library of content. If you are buying a first tablet for a child, I'd choose the Kindle Fire HD. At only $139, it is significantly cheaper and it has all of the options that the HDX has.Enterprise: As soon as Amazon releases its update, it will add VPN and network printing support. I believe all of the tablets have basic enterprise capabilities, including that support and various office apps. For real productivity, though, personally I'd go with a laptop, not a tablet.Support: Amazon wins this category, hands down, with the new Mayday system. Apple comes in second, with Apple and Amazon usually taking top marks in any customer support survey. This is an area where Google does not shine.Price: The HDX and Nexus win this one, hands down. Both are priced at $229 vs. $399 for the new iPad Mini. Neither Google nor Amazon makes much, if any, money on their tablets; they're counting on you to purchase content from their respective stores.From my own perspective, there is no single clear winner, as each tablet has strengths and weaknesses. If you already have Amazon Prime, the HDX is a no-brainer, with the access to the Prime Instant Video and the Kindle Owners' Lending Library. If you're primarily buying a tablet to read with, Amazon wins there, as well, with the 17-hour battery life while reading and the best display for reading outdoors. If you want apps, Apple and Google both have far more choices. If you want to watch movies, I'd pick either the HDX or the Nexus, as Apple's aspect ratio and its lagging sound put it at the back of the pack. If price is a factor, then you should pick either the HDX or the Nexus.If you're heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem, i.e., you already own an iPhone or iPad and all of your content is on iTunes, the HDX really isn't the tablet for you. Similarly, if you love browsing Google Play for apps to play on your Samsung Galaxy phone, you're likely to be disappointed in the section available on Amazon (although, as I note above, most of the Google Play apps can be sideloaded onto the tablet). If you love your Google Now or Siri, neither of which will ever be available on Amazon, this isn't the tablet for you.The bottom line: This tablet is primarily intended as a viewport into Amazon content and Amazon services. If you have Amazon Prime and you have Amazon eBooks in your collection, this tablet is a no-brainer. The price is low, particularly for what you get, and it's a small, light, high-quality, high-powered, tablet with a stunning display and superb sound. This really is one of the top tablets in its class.Note: As others have noted, the tablet will update its software when you first turn it on and connect to wifi. Unlike some others, I had no trouble with this operation, no glitches or crashes. It took several minutes but the process ran smoothly, as did the tablet when everything was done.Update:Now that I have a Kindle Fire HD and a Kindle Fire HDX tablet, I'm in a little better position to talk about which one I'd recommend:You should get the Kindle Fire HDX if:- You're a techie who wants the latest and greatest, the best display, the fastest processor.- You need a camera for Skype or other video app.- You play graphics-intensive games (e.g., racing games).- The size and weight matter to you, even in such small increments as this.- You think you will need the Mayday technical support.You should get the Kindle Fire HD if:- Price is a factor. $90 cheaper is not an insignificant amount. This really is an excellent value for the money.- You want an inexpensive tablet for a child (and, for this case, the lack of a camera might well be a plus)- All you want is a basic tablet for reading books, playing music, watching the occasional video, playing Words with Friends, and the like. While the screen on the HD isn't as stunning as is it on the HDX, this is still a true HD screen and it is very good.I check back pretty regularly, so if you have a question, please feel free to ask and I'll do my best to answer it.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice Tablet with Sharp Display", "Author": "Michael Gallagher", "ReviewID": "R23F7ENQQQYOVN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "To sum up what I will tell you about in the details below, for $229 you are getting a good deal on a tablet computer - especially if you compare it to the $199 for last year's first-generation Fire HD and the $500 or more you can spend on a Wi-Fi version of the iPad. Overall, if you consider the price and the functionality I think this is a great tool / toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device: the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and the new HD Fire.  If you are a first-time tablet buyer, where price vs. value is a key consideration, or if you are looking for an affordable tablet for the kids, I'd recommend the \"regular\" Kindle Fire HD that is only $139.  If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of that one.My review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the Fire HDX to the original Fire HD as well as this year's model of the Fire HD, but also some of the features for a first-time user.Consistent with my experience with setup of this year's model of the Kindle Fire HD, setup took a long time: despite being a brand new product, the Fire HDX attempted to download and install several operating software updates.  Software updates on a Kindle are usually in the background, and it was annoying watching the crashes and manual reboots.  Consistent with the Fire HD, it crashed during setup, playing a song, watching a TV show, and reading a book.  It took a little over an hour to get this thing up and running without consistent crashes but after the final software update it has worked as expected without further issues.Screen Display / Video Playback:This version of the Fire has the absolute best screen display of any Fire model to date. Looking at the technical specs Amazon made some major changes in the display / resolution, and the picture appears more crisp: I compared the viewing experience watching with my standard test of the Fire devices over the past couple of years - don't laugh - the first episode of the Wonder Woman TV series from the 70's. The display on this Fire was one heck of a lot better in terms of sharpness than last year's model as well as this year's model of the Fire HD. For you technical folks out there, the display is 1,920 x 1,200 with 50% more pixels per inch than the Fire HD.Wi-Fi Connectivity:The initial Wi-Fi setup took some time as it wouldn't remember the password for my router after each software update / crash / reboot series.  After the final operating software update I mentioned above, however, it was fairly easy to connect to the Internet via Wi-Fi.My standard test for trying out new gadgets is to see how fast they run side-by-side with a known piece of equipment doing the same test at the best place of Wi-Fi in my house and the worst place where it drags. In this comparison, I had this HDX version of the Fire sitting next to last year's and this year's version of the HD Fire, as well as last year's 8.9\" HD Fire, Motorola RAZR smartphone, my iPad 2 (yes, the Kindle guy uses an iPad for work), and the first-generation 7\" Fire (the model from two years ago) all just using a Wi-Fi connection vs. cellular connectivity.My \"normal\" website test is to hit the mobile websites of FoxNews, CNN, my personalized Yahoo page, Google, and the Houston Chronicle. The ones that were usually slow on the other devices were faster on the HDX (Houston Chronicle and CNN), and for the other sites I couldn't tell a difference in speed at the location closest to my router. When I went to the slowest / worst reception location of my house, the speed did have a noticeable difference in the other devices as this one was a little bit faster than all but last year's model of the 7\" Kindle Fire HD; yes, it was also faster than this year's model of the Fire HD but I attribute the increase in speed to the dual antennas on the HDX.Sound / Music Playback:The two speakers are located in the back of the Kindle Fire in two not-noticeable ports: one on the top and one on the bottom. My test of this feature was cranking up Van Halen's Panama to maximum volume (I always want to see if it could really play the guitar licks), and I would alternate covering one speaker up over the other: you have true stereo sound with no degradation of the sound that makes you think you are about to blow the speaker.  The Dolby speakers sound nice and you do get to hear the bass.  However, I am still of the opinion the speakers aren't going to do very well being placed in the back as I am in the front: I want to be able to hear whatever I am listening to without really having to crank it up and disturbing someone else in the room (that's what happens when you start losing your hearing like I am).  While the cover for this version has not shipped yet - why aren't the covers released at the same time? - I imagine the sound quality might decrease with a cover in the back over the speakers.  The X-ray feature is pretty neat as it displays the lyrics on the screen if you are so inclined; if you are not, it is as simple as the tap of an icon to make the lyric feature go away.Email Setup:Consistent with previous versions of the Fire, email setup was very easy for my main Gmail account, both with the software came with the Fire but my primary use of an existing app called Enhanced Email I purchased here in the Amazon app store. I did setup the email app that came with the program with no problem - it took about a minute to setup my main Google account - and I was able to send and receive emails as well as synch my online calendar via Google's calendar and contacts. For those of you asking yourself why am I using the Enhanced Email program, the simple answer is like many of you I have more than one email account: you can quickly switch back and forth on the accounts with the tool. The lazy person in me appreciates that as I don't like getting out of the lazy chair once I'm settled in!New Tabs and Screen Layout:In addition to the normal tabs Amazon has continued to make tweaks with the look and feel to the overall display such as more things to scroll through to find what you are looking for in an easier manner. Interestingly, and consistent with my experiences with this year's model of the Fire HD, I purchased the one with special offers and the only ad I have seen so far is on the main screen saver vs. being overwhelmed with ads like last year's model.Reading Books:Turning pages is pretty darn easy - just tap the side of the screen to go to the next page or back a page, or you can swipe your finger across the screen to do the same.  Amazon did add the feature to see the book's description for books on your device like they have with the e-Ink Kindle (always an annoyance with last year's model), which is a plus as I can't remember what each book in my digital to-be-read pile is about; getting to the book description, requires several taps on the screen to eventually get to where you want to be.  If there is an easier way to do it, I can't find it and maybe I should be one of the first guys, ever, to crack open the electronic user's manual to figure it out (doubt it).  For those of you who have wondered, you still can't organize your books into categories unless you purchase a third-party app</a> here in the Amazon app store.BluetoothThere is a Bluetooth connection, and I did my usual test of this feature by taking it out to my car and having the Fire stream music through my car stereo. There were no delays or skips with the connection, and it paired up in about a minute. Just make sure you give it a device name so you can recognize it and be recognized.Camera:There is a camera on this model - it faces the front or toward the user / reader.  Focusing and taking a picture is pretty easy, and Amazon will by default store your pictures in the Cloud - which counts against your storage allotment.  I'd recommend turning that automatic storage feature off unless you are sure you want it, because if you go over the limit that will provide Amazon another opportunity to collect a monthly revenue stream from you.Charger:Unlike previous models of the Fire, this one DOES include a charger!  If you're scratching your head with that comment, in previous models you had to purchase a charger separately for $20 which always seemed kind of silly for Amazon to do.\"Mayday\" button:A new feature with this model, and not included on this year's \"regular\" model of the Fire, is the introduction of the \"Mayday\" button.  Basically, you can touch the button and a video screen will pop up and you can actually see - and talk to - a live customer service agent.  I haven't pressed the button yet to try it out, as I think I would feel pretty dumb: when they ask me how can they help, I don't want to say \"I just wanted to see if this works and just stopped by to say `hi' for purposes of this review.\"What I Wish it Had: a case that was ready to go and shipped when the Fire was ready (why are we waiting).  A case is very important in order to protect your investment.  Also, I'm interested to see how they try to not hurt the speaker's performance I mentioned above due to the speakers being in the back of the unit and hopefully not covered up with a case.Overall, at $229 for the 16GB of memory model ($309 for 64 GB of memory) I think this is a good deal for someone who really uses the video / apps feature. Kids will love it as they can read books, play games, watch TV and movies, and a whole lot of other things. Adults should like it for the exact same reasons, but while I try to minimize the amount of work-related stuff I do at home with the business apps that are available here in the Amazon App store and other places around the Internet I can also work on Excel and Word-compatible files when I have to without having to fire up my work laptop or whatever the case may be. If you've never owned a tablet before, or are looking to upgrade from an earlier model Fire, I would recommend this one if video and apps are your thing - but make sure you purchase the higher memory one vs. the minimum 16 GB.  If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, or looking for a tablet for your younger children, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of last year's model or get this year's model of the Kindle Fire HD at $139.", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing Performance Worthy of Upgrade", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Goode & Eiffel\"", "ReviewID": "R3IO1X1FKICIE8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Netflix Issue:When I first got the KFHDX, I had no problems with Netflix.

If you already enjoy the Amazon ecosystem, crave responsively fast performance, love gorgeous high resolution screens, wish the Kindle Fire were noticeably lighter, all without sacrificing battery life, while being able to enjoy more benefits of Amazon Prime, plus many other great new features, then stop reading, save time, and hit the \"Add To Cart\" button and buy it.I wanted the Amazon ecosystem. I am a Prime member. I also own a Nexus phone, the Sony Xperia Tablet Z, and a few other Android devices, besides the original Kindle Fire. I don't mind that Kindle Fires don't have Google Play. I have other devices for that. My wife has the iPad 4.If this is going to be your only Android device, then the decision point is which do you prefer, the Google experience or Amazon experience? You can get most of the Amazon experience with a more conventional Android device.  The overlap is not as great going the other way around. However, with the new Fire OS, you do get a few more Amazon exclusive experiences. Weigh your needs and wants to make the best choice.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**SERVICE: Amazon service applies directly to this device since it is their product. Amazon had a one day only FAA 15% off sale for some of the Kindles. I opened up the MayDay and asked the rep if they would honor the discount to those who had previously made the purchase. I was told it would only apply for those who had made the purchase within the last 7 days. That was not me. The MayDay rep didn't really do anything wrong, but she just appeared as if she didn't care and seemed a little annoyed at my request. Because the customer CAN see the MayDay rep, in my mind, it would be very important that person have a smile and warm demeanor. I've done tech support for a business I once owned, and a simple thing like this can make a huge difference in how a customer perceives a company.I had also emailed Amazon, received a reply with a number, and gave that a call. The initial rep was kind enough to refer me to someone who could make that decision. The manager I spoke with made the decision to honor a partial refund, even though the 64GB model I had purchased was not one of the sale items. I didn't get the full 15%, but it was about 12% discount. I thought this was more than fair and I appreciated the fact that Amazon allows their service managers the freedom to make these kind of decision.I believe there were two factors in play. 1. My standing with Amazon as a shopper (not that they don't care about all their customers, but it's nice to be appreciated for being a loyal customer!) 2. I was still within my return window. I could have sent it back, bought the sale version and still come out ahead, in theory. It would have been a headache and extra cost for all involved, and this service manager was keen enough to save us all that headache. Even if I had to go that way, it's still great service that I could return the device this long after the purchase, for any reason.If I could make one request, it would be that there was a dedicated link within Amazon Shop for writing reviews. I find typing to be one of the more accurate experiences on the Fire HDX, much improved over original Fire, and would like to be able to write reviews straight from the new Fire HDX.After about 1.5 months use, I have no buyer's remorse. This is a great tablet and a great buy for Amazon fans.====================FIRST IMPRESSIONS====================The packaging, for those of you who care, was like looking at movie poster. It got you interested, excited and ready to open it up. Once the cover was opened, box unsealed, and then opened, the inside was simple and elegant. Inside is the Kindle Fire HDX, the 5 watt charger (not 9 watt), and a nice thick 5 foot long USB to micro-USB cord. That's it.Compared to the original Kindle Fire, the HDX 7\" is noticeably lighter and easier to hold. The angled edge harmoniously eases the hand into a comfortable holding position. This is great to hold! When holding landscape mode, the top, where the speakers are, is smooth glossy plastic. It attracts fingerprints but it actually adds to the grip. The Amazon logo that is recessed in the back is also this same gloss and also helps make the device less slippery to hold. Well done. Fortunately, those are the only places that are glossy plastic.Turning on the device, Amazon already had associated the device with my account. The carousel was familiar. But swipe up and there was the typical icon view.Overall, the device is snappy and responsive. No more lag. I love it! The screen is gorgeous. It rotates quickly from landscape to portrait. It's the best rotating screen I've experienced on any Android device so far, and I've had my share of Android devices.There are a myriad of new features to learn from the upgrade. So far, I like them - a lot. The Mojito OS does take some exploring to get fully adjusted. I'm still in that process after two hours of playing around.====================THE DETAILS====================-------------------------APPS (Added 2 DEC 2013):-------------------------One of the biggest CONS people mention about the Kindle Fire line is the lack of Google Play, which primarily means limited app choices. This is true. There are apps I wish I could get on the Kindle Fire HDX. For some this may be a deal killer. For me, it is not.Amazon has really gone above and beyond to make the lack of Google Play so much easier to take. Since I purchased the Kindle Fire HDX, it came with 500 Amazon coins. Within the Amazon Apps world, this translates to $5.00 to spend on any app. In the month plus I've been an owner, Amazon has offered a ton of free apps, good ones! In some cases, they offered a free app, plus more free coins. There seems to be no shortage of ways to get free coins. Even when I do spend the coins (and not my real money yet,) I've made a handful of purchases where I got more coins back, in one case, 250 coins just for making my first purchase using coins. Some of these deals equate to discounts of 30% or more.My new Kindle Fire HDX is loaded with games and apps I'd likely not have purchased on my own. Between this give-a-way fest and their daily free apps, I have a lot of great choices for full paid apps. Not all the daily free apps are very good, but some are. It's worth checking out, especially during this Thanksgiving/Christmas time period.The Kindle Fire is meant for consumption and Amazon has done a great job making sure I can do just that without breaking the bank. Amazon makes up for its shortcoming in the apps department by being far more generous than Google is with their store.With the current Cyber Monday sale, the Kindle Fire HDX is a steal! Let me reinforce that the Snapdragon 800 processor/Adreno 330 combo is one awesome setup! It makes apps like Minecraft, RipTide 2 and others look gorgeous and perform without hiccup. It's no small deal that the top of the line hardware can be had for bargain hunter prices.----------TURN IT ON:----------The power button is on the left back side. It does take a moment to figure this out when being used to a button on the top or side has been the norm for so long. It's not a big deal, but surprising after forgetting for the first time.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**I still find the button on back to be somewhat clumsy. Even though the other side has two recessed buttons for the volume, it doesn't stand out enough for me. I'm still flipping the device back and forth at night with little or no light. Even in the day time or with light, I have to make a concerted effort to determine which way is up and remember that the power button is on the left. With my other devices, I just feel for the button and push.-----------------------------DOWNLOAD PRIME VIDEOS:-----------------------------This is the main reason I purchased the 64 GB WiFi version. First, I could take videos with me when I had no internet connection, such as in a car. Second, when my kids want to watch videos, I can download their favorites so they won't be hogging the bandwidth at home!How does this work? Go to the videos, choose the desired video and an option to download will be there. My first attempt to download a Prime video, I chose Downtown Abbey Season 3, Episode 1, which was 1:06 hours long. I was given three options: Standard Definition, 720P HD and 1080 HD. I selected the 1080P HD option first.My internet is 10 Mb/s DSL download speeds. I made it to about 44% downloaded after about 50 minutes. Of course, I kept on checking out other features during the wait. While trying to start Flick Soccer, the device locked up on me. I was stuck. I held the power button for a good while and it rebooted.The HDX then successfully upgraded the system, something that failed after my initial setup. Yes, an update already (for the Mayday button!) When I looked to see if the video was there, it was not. I had to start all over again. It didn't save.This time, I chose 720P HD. It took about 19 minutes to download. I was previously able to view the 1080P video while it was downloading. It looked awesome. The 720P HD looked just about as good. Some action scenes, I could tell it was lower quality, but not that noticeable. This 1:06 hour 720P HD video file consumed 1.24 GBs of space.Next I tried the SD, or lowest quality option and downloaded Episode 2. This took 5 minutes and 44 seconds. The SD video file size for a 1:06 episode was 267MB. The video was a tad blurry, more choppy during action, and more noise, grain and artifacts. However, for standard definition, it was surprisingly passable. Download your young kid's videos in SD and save some space. They won't care, and even you may not.Finally, I retried the 1080P video with Episode 3. This time, it took 44 minutes 38 seconds to successfully download. The quality, as mentioned before, was excellent. The colors were vibrant, the video sharp and fluid. It took up 2.07GBs of space.Here is the rundown. About 1 hour video episode of Downtown Abbey. 10 Mb/s DSL download speed.SD = 5:44 minutes to download. 267MB. Quite decent quality.720P = 19:12 minutes to download. 1.24GB. Very good quality.1080P = 44:38 minutes to download. 2.07 GB. Excellent quality.For those who are new to the Amazon world, yes, you can download the Netflix app and watch those, too, minus the download for later option.**UPDATE 23 OCT 2013**:Yes, there are 3 quality settings for downloading Prime Videos. After digging around, I found a few more choices.After swiping down system menu in the Home screen, go to:Settings / Applications / VideosHere you will see individual settings for HD and SD downloads. It turns out HD has 3 quality settings and SD has 3 quality settings.  I chose to ask for each setting.Also, in this menu, you will find the option for Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 Audio. Because this increases the size of the video while streaming, it is turned OFF by default. I turned it on and it does make a noticeable difference with surround sound effect, both with speakers and headphones. The video you are watching will need to support this feature.In this Video settings, there is also the option to clear video search history.Another discovery with Prime Video downloads is that most videos do have a time limit for viewing offline. As long as you connect back online, it resets that time, so not a big deal in most cases. So far, I've noticed videos such as \"Under the Dome\" have a 48 hour limit offline before needing to reconnect. Other videos have a 30 day window. It seems as if some of the kids' videos had no such time limit for offline viewing.**UPDATE 2 DEC 2013**I am discovering that not all Prime videos can be downloaded. This seems to be true with a lot of newer Prime movies and some TV shows. I'm hoping it is a licensing issue and not a decision made by Amazon. If possible, please make ALL Prime videos downloadable!I also find the ability to browse videos to be tedious. Similar to Netflix, on the Kindle devices, Amazon pushes out choices to you in limited quantities. If your watching habits change on any given day, you will need to really dig into the menu choices to see all the viewing options out there. The menu choices overlap and can make browsing confusing, and a challenge to track what one has already browsed.In the Videos, in the side menu under \"Prime Instant Video\" there are three main choices:Top TV ShowsTop MoviesFor the KidsWhat tipped me off, is under \"For the Kids\" there are very few choices. I knew from my Roku device and from browsing from a web viewer, there had to be more choices for the kids.Regardless of which of the three main categories one chooses, each has a sub-menu found by tapping the little down arrow that is right of the category description, such as:MOVIES (Upper left hand corner once this choice has been selected)Top Movies, Prime (Right under, MOVIE, in smaller letters) and the arrow is just right of this.Each main category has sub-menu items, as noted before. But each sub-menu also has the same choices. These would be the same regardless of which main category one came from. Hence, this is where some confusion can come into play.What each sub-menu has, within each main Prime category, is an option called, \"Genres.\"  This is where one needs to go to find the rest of the Prime viewing choices. Unfortunately, there are even more sub-categories within each Genre choice. One will never find all the choices in one place for mass browsing.Are you confused? That is my point. Browsing could be less confusing and easier to navigate.For these two points within Prime Video, I'd knock off a half star. But since I can't, I'll leave my rating at 5 stars because overall, I'm still very happy with the device.----------AUDIO:----------I found the speakers to have decent sound. It sounds a tad more fuller than my Sony Xperia Tablet Z, but iPad 4 is still much better and sounds louder. The new HDX is sufficiently loud enough while holding it, but I do wish it could go a notch or two louder. With my Klipsch X10i head phones, the sound was plenty loud. It sounded better than the speakers and was OK. It won't win over Audiophiles, but good enough for entertainment purposes.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**In Settings/Device/Applications/Videos Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 Audio is shut off by default. Turn it on. It improves the sound, especially with the built in speakers. I can actually sense a better surround sound effect in videos that support this.I find that the speaker sound is actually pretty good the more I use it. There is more meat to the sound than I initially thought. For personal use, the loudness is good in a quiet environment. The sound quality is good for a tablet. The sound stage is narrow. The surround sound effect, once turned on is decent. The simulated surround effect is noticed most of the time.I still think the iPad 4 has the best built in speakers I've heard on a phone or tablet. I listened to the built in speakers on the new iPad Air, and the Kindle Fire HDX is much better. The iPad Air built in speakers takes a big step back compared to the iPad 4. The Air also has mono speakers and it really sounds mono, in a bad way.**UPDATE 2 DEC 2013**Rather than relying strictly on my memory, I went back and tested the audio side by side with my wife's iPad 4. I would say the sound quality is about the same. What I overlooked was the fact the iPad 4 only has one external speaker. It is mono. In that regards, I give the nod to the Kindle Fire HDX. With some surround effect, once turned on, the HDX separates itself even more. From my own testing, the built in speakers are one of the best on any tablet or phone. The more I use it this way, the more I am enjoying it. In most cases where disturbing others is not a concern, I don't feel compelled to need headphones. If one does need a little bit louder sound, hold it with both hands from the top, and the sound reflects directly to you, making it sound a little louder. The decision to put the speakers on top in landscape mode, was a very good one.----------GRAPHICS:----------The HDX has the latest and greatest Adreno graphics to compliment the current king of the hill quad-core Snapdragon 800 2.2GHz processor. Yes, it is a huge upgrade from the original Kindle. Huge!Playing the Temple Run games, I'd get frustrated with the lag on the original Kindle Fire. No more lag. Graphics look great. No video tearing.In Minecraft PE, the original Kindle can play it, but It's not a great experience. The HDX plays it with the best Androids out there. Once again, the beautiful screen and powerful graphics chip makes playing Minecraft a joy, even with Amazon's highly skinned version of Android running it.----------SCREEN:----------The screen is sharp. Texts are very crisp. Colors are accurate and beautiful. There are no pixels to be seen by my naked eye.One nice surprise is that the screen itself seems to be somewhat oliophobic. While fingerprints are there, they seem to disappear some. It is one of the better screens for this, at least that is my initial impression. I don't think this was even intended. I'll revisit this later with more time.The screen is glossy. It does reflect a lot. But once turned on, it can be noticeable, but also easily forgotten. If you are prone to glare and easily distracted by it, keep this in mind.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**After further use, I still think the Kindle Fire HDX screen is one of the best screens in terms of keeping it clean. It does collect finger oils, but I find it still keeps on cleaning off easier than any other device I've ever used. I don't even need a special cloth. Just by cleaning it off with the palm of my hands, the screen looks nearly clean again!----------MAYDAY:----------Yes, I tried it. I really had a question! No, really! I knew that while reading a book, the HDX could have its contrast adjusted for better reading in sunlight, as well as longer battery life. I looked everywhere how to get to this setting. I couldn't find it.I opened up the Mayday feature and waited about 30 seconds to connect. After confirming my email, address and name associated with my account, I was asked how they could help. With the speaker on full volume, I had a difficult time hearing the female tech, Celeste. I asked her my question and she did need to seek help to find the answer, but I got the answer. She was friendly. I could move the little window wherever I wanted. At one point, she took control of the screen.The answer was that the screen brightness setting had to be set to auto and it would then recognize when to make the adjustments while reading.It might seem a little daunting to do tech support via video conference. Don't worry. The video is one way. They don't ever see you. The tech can only see your screen.The Mayday button is added with the first initial system update, which should take place during the setup. But if it failed the first time like it did for me, you won't see it when swiping down for the settings on top of the screen. Manually update the Kindle by swiping down the top and finding it in the settings.I really don't see Mayday being a feature I'll need much, but it's a nice touch for the tech challenged.----------X-RAY:----------This could be one of the most underrated features. I didn't bat an eye about it before the purchase. Now, I think it is really useful and can see myself turning to it all the time.In movies, tap the video screen and X-Ray pops up on the left side. X-Ray detects which characters are in the current scene and you can find out more about the actor. Trivia facts are also there. It's like watching a DVD with narration on, only much less annoying and much smarter.In the Music player, X-Ray provides scrolling lyrics that follow the song as it goes. If you are a karaoke fan (I am not much so) then you will love this.Yes, even in some books, X-Ray is there. It provides footnote like data about characters and terms. I've only seen it in the book Les Miserable. There could be more. I'm guessing it depends on what the publisher provides.----------------SILK WEB BROWSER:----------------It's pretty fast for an Android tablet. On a tablet, I still find the Ipad 4 is the best experience with Safari. There is the option for mobile website, desktop version, or automatic. This is a bit misleading. I prefer desktop version of websites. However, with Silk, you won't get a real desktop experience. Silk still customizes the website to fit the HDX screen. The accuracy will depend on each website.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013***I find I don't use the Silk Browser much unless I need to quick look something up. I really wish the option to have a full desktop view did just that. On some of my sites, like Yahoo, it does a bad job of rendering pages. I may have to side load Chrome.---------------KINDLE FREETIME:---------------I just set up Kindle FreeTime. I did the Family Plan for up to 6 kid profiles for $6.99 a month. The other option is for one child for $2.99 a month.Once I set the age (but not actual birthdays, just close to their age) for each child, and subscribed to the unlimited family plan, I tried using it.It was a bit confusing at first. I wanted to set the content for each child. I couldn't find all these \"unlimited\" apps, books and videos for kids. I could only see what was already on my device or what I owned in the cloud.Only when I actually logged in as one of my kids, did I see all the kid's content I had subscribed. There were plenty of choices. The initial choices were for me to determine what I wanted my kids to be able to access that was for my main account. No, I don't want them to have access to all me and my wife's content. But yes, I do want them to have access to other apps and videos we already purchased. That was what the initial content filtering was all about.My first impression of Kindle FreeTime is that I may end up having to buy each kid their own Kindle. I can see them fighting over MY, I stress MY, Kindle HDX. I may never see it again once I let them on it. I think it's going to be that good. Thankfully, I can set time limits for them!**UPDATE 23 OCT 2013**:I could not download videos for offline use within FreeTime. That seems to be an Amazon Prime video benefit.Only certain books could be downloaded and viewed while offline.I did like that some books can be set to have a narrator read the books to the young child. This is good for my 3 year old. He loves the Thomas books that do this.------------BATTERY LIFE:------------The HDX came with about 60% charge. I'm making an educated guess since it was a graphic meter that is the default battery indicator. I changed it to show percentage after I'd used the Kindle for a short while. It had 54% by that time. After about 4.5 -5 hours of very heavy usage setting up, testing and downloading, I'm at the last 1%.After completely draining the battery to where it shut off by itself, here is what I've been able to measure for recharging with the standard 5 watt included charger, which does eat up 2 outlets on an older power strip:15% in 28:44 minutes30% in 1:00 hour40% in 1:22 hours50% in 1:42 hours60% in 2:03 hours70% in 2:21 hours90% in 3:05 hours95% in 3:15 hours100% in 3:34 hours Whew!Note: There is no indicator light to show charging status.**UPDATE 25 OCT 2013**:I let my kids use the new Kindle Fire HDX during a 4 hour trip to visit family. With some video, lots of multiplayer MineCraft use, it lasted from Noon to 9 PM with about 35% battery life left. It wasn't on all the time, but it was being used frequently.In a more detailed drain test, here are the results:5:41 Hours = 100% Brightness playing constant video (downloaded)9:28 Hours = 50% Brightness playing constant video (downloaded)During the 50% brightness test, it took 4:52 hours to drain down to 50% battery life. It took 4:36 minutes to drain from 50% down to 0% where it powered off on its own.50% brightness is still viewable even in a well lit room. However, I'd at least go 70%. In dimly lit areas with some light, 50% is plenty bright.The Kindle HDX is very efficient with power. It barely warms up and it never gets hot. The claimed rating of 11 hours with mixed use seems about right and that's using it constantly. With light to medium use, one could easily go a full day and likely two or three away from a power source.----------------------------HOW MUCH MEMORY SHOULD I GET:----------------------------The base model with 16GB memory is $229. To double that memory to 32GB costs another $40. Compared to Apple's memory upgrade practice, this is a cheap upgrade. To quadruple the base memory of 16GB to 64GB costs $80. This is the best value if you are going to upgrade the internal storage size. Here's why:$2.50 per GB to add 16GB storage to base model for a total of 32GB.$1.67 per GB to add 48GB storage to the base model for a total of 64GB.I got the 64GB model because I am a content lover. I love choice. I love freedom to use even when speedy internet is not available. I want to be able to download videos for my kids when travelling in the car. Even at home, I'd rather they view videos locally from a device so I don't have to fight bandwidth with them! Data these days can add up fast. 8 GB on original Kindle Fire was definitely not enough for me. The new HDX can't be upgraded later, so I did it now. 64 GB was the cheapest upgrade option per GB. Your reasons may vary, but maybe that will help you decide what's best for you just in case you haven't thought about a few of those points.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**If you want to save some money, the 32GB should be enough for most people. I consider myself a heavier user. I currently have about 17 episodes (most an hour episode) and 2 full length movies, all in 720P HD and I have 31.5GB space left. I haven't loaded my own videos yet, but that is something I plan on doing. I'm glad I got 64GB.For those of you that don't care about storing large files on the Kindle device, the 16GB should suffice. If you change your mind down the road, you'll need to buy a whole new device, so be sure of what you want. I will say that I'm glad 8GB option is gone. That just didn't cut it.If you are buying for kids, 16GB could be enough. Download videos in SD and it will save a lot of space and still be decent viewing quality. Also, with some diligence, simply delete content you've watched and you'll get that space back. If you can live without the convenience and willing to work at it a bit, 16GB is still a good choice. For kid use with SD video, the 32GB option will give you ample room for the convenience factor.-----------------------------------SPECIAL OFFERS OR NO SPECIAL OFFERS:-----------------------------------I opted to keep the special offers. Why? Because, they don't bother anyone. You'll only see them from time to time on the screen lock when you first turn the HDX on. Special Offers don't show up at any other time when you are using the device. If you like Gold Box deals, supposedly, some of these offers can be exclusive and even better deals. Why not? I'll save $15 for that. I think people make way too big a fuss over this. Spend that money on some apps, songs or other content. The fun you'll get from that will far outweigh the seeing a few ads that barely intrude on your life.----------PORTS:----------I have noticed that plugging in both the head phone jack and the micro-USB port requires going in at a slight angle. The angle matches the angled edges of the Kindle HDX. Don't force it in straight on! Be gentle at first until you get the feel of it.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013***After almost a month and a half, I find the micro-USB power port to remain a tight and secure fit. It's one of the most secure feeling connections I've felt for a micro-USB device. We'll see how it holds up after more time.----------------------KINDLE ONLY EXCLUSIVES:----------------------Try watching Amazon Prime videos from an Android device post ICS. Google doesn't support Adobe Flash in Android any more. I find it frustrating. I can watch Amazon Prime videos from my Kindle devices.I am one that does like to listen to my books while driving. You can't do this from the Kindle app on other Android devices. Text to speech only works on actual Kindle devices. I'm not sure if the text to speech voice changed with the Mojito OS, but I like the new voice better. It is still mechanical, but much better. My only gripe is that the text to speech shuts off if you manually turn a page and when screen rotates. Please change this! Let text to speech stop when I choose to stop it, especially when driving in a car.====================PARTING THOUGHTS====================The Kindle 7\" HDX is meant for consumption of content for Amazon lovers. It excels at this in almost every way, from hardware to software. If you love Amazon, absolutely get it. Navigating Amazon's skinned Android is simple and easy to use, but not meant for the tinkerer. It's definitely not Apple in design. But, it is functional. It knows what it is and the latest Kindle Fire HDX, to me, is even more exciting than the original. The improvements are that good.====================PROS & CONS====================PROS:o Top of the line hardware, super fast and responsiveo Gorgeous screen for both resolution and coloro Screen handles fingerprints very wello Lightweight and easy to holdo Download Prime Videoso Long battery lifeo Crisp text for readingo Great price for the hardwareo Kindle FreeTime for the kidso Parental controlso X-Ray provides useful information for video, music and bookso Kindle exclusive featureso Mayday offers free support and helpCONS:o Back power and volume buttons need getting used too Speakers sound OK, but could be a little loudero Text to speech in books stops with screen rotation or manual turn of pageo No rear camerao No HDMI out porto No GPSo No Google Play", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Blue/purple border on white pages!", "Author": "LindaFus \"lindafus\"", "ReviewID": "RXJ3VD36FN0O2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased my Kindle Fire HDX from Best Buy. After trying to read a book, I noticed a pretty bright blue/purple streak that never went away on the sides of the pages. Going into Sepia and changing the background pages did not help this issue.  I called Amazon and they replaced it with a new one. The new one has the same blue/purple border on white and light background pages. The Amazon replacement is more subtle and even around the edges, so I opted to return the one that had the darker boarder.I now see on Amazon's  description of the Kindle Fire HDX that they actually mention this defect as being normal and I quote below:----------------We want you to know...\"The Kindle Fire HDX 7\" has perfect color accuracy (100% sRGB), and we wanted to share more details around our display design decisions that helped us achieve this.You may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. All displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy. Most LCD displays use white LEDs, and then apply filters to extract the desired color. The result is oftentimes a compromise to tone and color accuracy, or--if attempting to address these compromises--an increase in battery consumption and, thus, device weight.We've taken a different approach. To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7\" at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20% improvement in power efficiency.\"---------------This glow is not light nor is it narrow.  The text of a book runs through this and it is very uncomfortable to read this way. This is also true for the Silk Web browser.  I will keep my Kindle Fire for a bit and see how this all pans out with Amazon.  Buyer beware:  Reading with this blue/purple glow is not the same as it is on your Kindle HD or older.After stating the above, I will say, other than this serious screen flaw, this device runs everything else flawlessly and I love streaming movies on this device. Netflix runs great as does Amazon Prime movies. Apps load instantly and web pages as well. This screen issue not so much. I am a bit confused as to why Amazon thinks this blue/purple haze is ok.  I will try to get used to it.", "Date": "October 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Most amazing device I've ever owned!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1NFRVWEUS01UH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm 64 years of age and a teacher. I am no techie, but really enjoy the electronic gadgets that are being invented these days. I preordered and purchased the very first generation Kindle 2 years ago and felt that it was time for an upgrade. This time, I waited a couple of days to see how it was received by the public and to catch a few of the early reviews before deciding to order. I'm sorry I waited. This tablet is AMAZING for my purposes! It is designed for media consumption and anyone who purchase it ought to be aware of it. It does a great job in that aspect.The \"purple haze\" a number of reviewers have complained about seems quite inobtrusive to me. I don't know that if I were not previously aware it would even be in the discussion. It is a very faint, but discernible border around thedevice when reading.  I haven't found it to be annoying at all and shouldn't be a deal-breaker.I use the device for reading of books and magazines, watching movies and television shows, playing games, e-mail and light surfing of the web. I'm even able to download my students' grades and attendance records from the school web site more rapidly than my hardwired computer in my workplace! The screen picture is more than outstanding...it is unbelievable! The keyboard appears when it is supposed to and is very responsive, just like the rest of the touch screen. And lest I forget the Mayday button, this whole concept is unreal, when I consider the time spent with most customer service outfits on the phone line waiting for my cal to be answered. Great job, AmazonDownloads of movies and games are quick. I have installed Netflix and Hulu Plus on the device and they work flawlessly with the device. As a Prime member as well, it works seamlessly. My digital subscriptions to several magazines were a snap to transfer to this device. All in all, my expectations were far exceeded by the product.The device is lightweight, beautiful and so cool I purchased an inexpensive ($4.95) case on line from Poetic that provides a lightweight shell and keeps the sleekness of the device intact, yet still allows me to prop it up for video viewing. It also puts the device in sleep mode when the cover is closed and the device immediately awakes when the cover is opened.While I understand the criticism, why buy the device if you knew it's limitations? It is the best at what it is supposed to do and the price when compared to other tablets on the market is a steal, if you consider what it is able to do (and not what it WASN'T supposed to do.In summation, if you are not a techie and just like to relax with a movie, read a book or magazine or play a game, start ordering your HDX now. Media doesn't have to cost you a fortune, is thousand of books I have ordered over the years have been free, and for a couple of hundred dollars a year I and my wife get all the video we want for all our devices from Prime, Netflix and Hulu +. It's the best toy I ever bought. Final rating: 9 out 0f 5!!!!!", "Date": "November 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best 7\" tablet on the market?", "Author": "J. Chambers", "ReviewID": "R3N1QB8TWW0WRJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "NOTE: This review is for the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" tablet with 32GB, special offers, and Wi-Fi only.I pre-ordered both the original Kindle Fire and the Kindle Fire HD 7\" tablets when they were first announced. It was love at first swipe. The second generation HD was a huge advance over the first generation, with the welcomed addition of an external volume control, an HDMI port, and higher screen resolution. The HDX is also a big step-up from its predecessor. The most obvious improvements:* Higher resolution - 1920x1200 (323 ppi) in the HDX versus 1280x800 (216 ppi) in the HD. That's a huge difference, especially when viewing HD videos. The HDX has a new graphics processor that Amazon says has 4X the performance of the HD.* Faster processor - a 2.2GHz quad-core Snapdragon processor in the HDX versus 1.5GHz dual-core processor in the HD. This is really advanced hardware for a tablet, putting the HDX at the high-performance end of the tablet market. Also, the HDX has 2GB of RAM, compared to the HD's 1GB.* Longer battery life - 11 hours (up to 17 hours in a \"reading mode\") for the HDX versus 10 hours for the HD.* Lighter weight - 10.7 ounces for the HDX versus 13.9 ounces for the HD. That's a noticeable difference when you're hand-holding the Fire. The weight reduction comes from a magnesium body covered with a rubbery material that's easy to grip. The shape is different, too, with beveled edges that help with hand-holding the HDX, since your fingers curl around it better. Also, the speakers have been moved from their position in the HD to the top of the beveled section (in the landscape orientation). This is a nice improvement from the HD, since your fingers won't cover the speakers in the HDX. And speaking of audio, X-Ray lyrics for my downloaded songs is a really cool feature. Really cool.* I like the new display. The display on the HD was the carousel filling most of the home page. This is still the default on the HDX, but swiping upward fills the screen with apps instead.* The power button and volume control have been moved. I hated the ones on the HD. They were hard to see and hard to find by feel. On the HDX, the concave buttons are on either side of the tablet when it's held in landscape position. It's not perfect, but I like it better.Those improvements alone make the HDX worth upgrading from the HD in my opinion. My biggest frustration with the HD was how the Silk browser was unresponsive sometimes, sitting there while I tapped a link several times. Occasionally, rebooting got the browser back on track, but it was frustrating. I've been using the HDX's browser for several hours, and it's been very smooth and responsive so far.I've already noticed a lot of fairly minor changes from the HD. For one, they've tweaked the virtual keyboard a bit. The most obvious change was to kill the long-press apostrophe from the period key. Now the apostrophe is on the numerical keyboard. It's not a big deal, it just takes some getting used to. Also, from some of the first reviews of the HDX that I read, some users are complaining about a purple border around web pages. To be honest, I barely noticed it. It's a very light purple about a tenth of an inch wide on my HDX. I don't know why it's there, but it doesn't bother me.Amazon will now allow some Prime Instant Video movies and TV shows to be downloaded onto the HDX and viewed later. I haven't tried this yet (and I don't know how you identify these videos if this feature is active), but it may be a good enough reason to go with the 32GB or 64GB versions of the HDX if you watch a lot of videos and aren't always connected to Wi-Fi. By the way, the HDX's memory is in a single partition where you can store anything, including books/audio books/magazines, apps, music, and videos. With my 32GB version of the HDX, about 25GB was free when I got the device.The most innovative new feature in the HDX is the \"Mayday\" button. Amazon says this will connect you with a real person who can in real-time walk you through a problem. (You must have an active internet connection to do this.) I just had to try it, so I did. \"Katie\" came online in just a few seconds, and after verifying my name, home address, and email address, she helped me with a couple of questions I had. That's remarkable customer service.As good as it is, though, the HDX isn't perfect. Here are my biggest disappointments:* They took the HDMI port away. Granted, with Prime streaming videos and our Roku box, I didn't use it often, but I wish it was still there. Amazon has announced that there's a software update coming that will let you send video through a PlayStation 3 or to certain Samsung TVs, but I don't have either of those.* There's still no GPS in the Wi-Fi HDX, although unless you have the 4G model (which includes GPS), it doesn't matter so much. In any case, you can still use apps like MapQuest for trip planning.* No speech recognition. I really hate this. Without this feature, there won't be any cool apps like Apple's Siri or Android's Speaktoit Assistant. Actually, you can install Speaktoit Assistant from the Amazon appstore, but you have to type in commands instead of speaking them. (Note: I read somewhere that it's possible to download Google Voice Search from the Google Play store, enabling speech recognition on the Kindle Fire.) There is a microphone, though, so you can use voice recorder apps and music recognition apps like Shazam and SoundHound.But despite a few disappointments, I'm generally very pleased with the HDX. It's a superb tablet. Although the Amazon appstore is still dwarfed by Google Play, Amazon's vast media library of books and magazines, videos, and music more than makes up for fewer apps, at least for me. The very smooth Silk web browser is greatly improved, and setting up email accounts and using email is very easy.I haven't bought a cover for the HDX, although I'm sure I will, since my old HD case won't fit the HDX. Amazon has its \"Origami\" case, and other companies are already advertising their HDX cases, but I'll wait a month or two and see what all is out there before buying one. Fortunately, the HDX's size is close enough to the HD's that the padded sleeve I got for the HD is big enough for the HDX.And a pleasant surprise: Kindles always ship with a USB charging cable, but I was surprised to see a wall charger in the box too.Bottom line: I really like the HDX, and for me it was worth the upgrade from my year-old HD.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not Worth the Aggravation of the Connection Problems", "Author": "Wayne \"wyadams\"", "ReviewID": "R31UC33XHKN8MS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It seems that Amazon is aware that the Kindle Fire has problems connecting and staying connected to wireless networks, and has chosen to ignore the problem and continue to sell this piece of garbage.

It disconnects from our network at random times, and at other times will not connect at all, sometimes for an entire day.

In fact no other wireless device on our network has EVER had connection problems.My recommendation is to find some other HD tablet and wait for Amazon to get the message that they can't foist this kind of garbage on the public and expect us to buy it.In addition, though the display and sound are excellent, there is not enough difference between the Fire and other HD tablets to make it worth the aggravation and hours of dead time.

Sadly, it was not to be.  I assessed several different tablets, making charts on hardware, performance' pros & con's etc.  Here are the HDX's pros & con's and a footnote of why I ultimately chose another one.PROS ~AMAZING picture quality.  Color conformity was the best of any of the tablets in the running.  The Nexus 7 was a very close second but the HDX's black level added more depth.  Interestingly, you lose some of that brilliance if you go up from the 7 to the 8.9.Sound was the best of all tested models.  Excellent volume, base and clarity.The on/off & volume buttons take a little getting used to, but the dimensions and solid feeling of the device help you get used to their unusual placement.  I appreciated the non-slick, rubbery feel of the HDX's covering.The Mayday feature is a great addition, and I think other companies should follow suit.  I saved myself a lot of time just by asking them a 20 second question that might have taken me 10 minutes to find searching the web.The front camera was the hands down best out of the tested competition.  It looked like a regular camera picture.  Actually, if you could figure out how to maneuver it, good camera shots could be taken with the front camera.Connectivity to everything Amazon based was, of course,  excellent.The Silk browser works smoothly, but I missed features of other browsers.The sale price is 229 for a 32gb model was great.CONS ~The blue/purple \"frame\" around every white screen is not acceptable, should not have to be \"worked around\" and is definitely NOT normal, no matter how much Amazon wants you to think it is...I really do love Amazon, but I couldn't shake this Orwellian feeling that Amazon was Big Brother & the Mayday button was put there to spy on us. :-)  Seriously though, they lack flexibility and are \"android based\" but not a fully functional android.  Picture a bird with some feathers clipped so they can't fly.If I fully understood what it meant to have NO access to Google play store, I would have considered more carefully.  It's not like comparing apples to oranges.  Well, in this case apples to androids to kindles.  Yes, they are trying to improve their app library, but they have a LONG way to go.  On a side note, I found it frustrating to not be able to use the same apps as my friends & family.Although the readability initially seems great (esp if you go to black with white writing to ignore the purple frame), you don't want to compare it with the HDX 8.9.  Side by side the 7's reading screen on white looked \"dirty\" compared to the 8.9's crisp whiteness (same purple haze on both sadly).  I kept checking the 7's settings to make certain it wasn't on sepia.IN A NUTSHELL ~I wanted to choose the HDX, loved the movie experience on it, albeit at 7 inches.  It felt wonderful to hold & performed almost seamlessly.  But I could not overcome the flaws in our relationship.I want to read books on a crisp white screen with no blue/purple border.I want access to ALL things android, apps, browsers, features, not just \"Amazon android\".I finally settled on a very close second with the Nexus 7.  I'm still getting used to the feel of it but a case makes it feel sturdier. I did, however, have no trouble getting used to having all those endless apps available to me again.Hope you all find joy this season in your tablet search!UPDATE 5/28/14Well, I returned the Kindle and kept the Nexus. After awhile I missed the Kindle so much that I bought another one on a huge sale day. I LOVE my Kindle, accept it's limitations and do the unavailable android things I need to do on my phone.The Nexus became the teenagers tablet. It never felt \"good\" in my hands. After 6 months it died. Asus customer support was straightforward enough and they paid for shipping to the warranty dept. But now, it's been over 2 weeks since they received it and I still don't have a working tablet. No updates either. I had to hunt it down online to find out that it's status was \"still in repair\".If it were MY tablet and not my teens, I'd be going nuts. ;)So, I'm happy with my Kindle but probably wouldn't be if I didn't have my Galaxy phone to get my android app fix.", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Horrible Purple Blue Hue Along Edges Very Obvious!", "Author": "Gregory G.", "ReviewID": "R2BB6E6JP37KMQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "So far not happy at all with a product that almost cost me $300.00 and has a HORRIBLE VERY OBVIOUS blue/purple line that goes alone the whole screen on both sides.

My fault for not fully understanding its limitations But...", "Author": "Bob \"Bob in Big Bear Ca\"", "ReviewID": "R1EMZBVAQM3X7L", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "5/11/14 Update:Having had the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" for a couple of months now, my experience with this device has me convinced that there are much better options available a within the same price range.I'll go over some of the ground that I wrote in my full review below, but feel those things that I do go over are important considerations in determining whether or not the Kindle will work for you so I'll be going over the most important points here as well.First off the display.While the display looks great in general, I am a little disappointed with the brightness of the display when outdoors. I do not have another tab to use as a reference to compare it with other right now, but when comparing my cellphone (which is at least as bright as the Kindle) it seems to me they could have done something to improve the lighting for outdoors. The color saturation is very good, especially in gaming, but might have a little too much color contrast for some when watching video. When I have used it to watch movies or TV provided using Netflix or my Prime Membership, I've found that video sometimes lags. The lag could be a result of several things, including the hardware or system resources provided on this device. I have 3 computers at home and a Blue Ray player that all stream Prime Instant video, and none of the other devices have similar issues. Let me rephrase that comment. I have seen Prime lock up and lag on all the devices I own, but none of the others have the severity or frequency of problems the Kindle has. Again I would guess it's a lack system resources or possibly a hardware issue.The Flexibility of the Kindle:In terms of flexibility I guess this could be seen as subjective. Here's what I've found to be the problem with the Kindles Flexibility and one of the outstanding issues I've found with it.Amazon had set up packet blocking and redirect on their devices. This means the Kindle will not stream other media from sources. For instance I have an account with Google where I have about 130 Gigs of music stored. My media is stored there free of charge and supports large and various file formats. Though it is a competitor of Amazons Google Play does not block or redirect when you try to access media stored elsewhere. Amazon on the other hand has blocked or diverted most other devices using the Android UI or Android variant from accessing Prime Instant Video. I can access the small amount of music I have stored in Amazons cloud, but Video is blocked. Yes I can access Netflix, and YouTube. There are some sites where the Kindle will either lock up, or be redirected somewhere else. BTW YouTube streams pretty well, but not as smoothly as my 2 year old Droid does though.So four month over all opinion of the Kindle, is that it that if you want a semi-flexible E-Reader this might be a good choice for you. In my case I've found the Kindle to be too limited and it's fallen short of my expectations, and that's even comparing it to my cellphone. The lack of onboard storage (which was promoted earlier on as a none issue for modern users) has turned a real problem and the 16GB version actually leaves the user with closer to 8 or 9GB than the 16GB advertised. It does play some games well, but it has more limitations than implied (the 32GB or larger versions might be able to handle graphics better but...) It will stream Amazons Prime or Netflix Video pretty well, but music outside of Amazons services is a problem. The fact that Amazon begins charging to store music on their site after a certain point seems ridiculous, and they do drop music that you've purchased from their site unless you purchase more space. I feel that Amazon charging to store music that you've bought from them is greedy, but especially since other sites (sites like Google Play) allow free uploading and storage huge amounts of personal music and media.5/11/14...When I decided to purchase the Kindle HDX. I had been looking at several tablets closely for the past few months to use while I was away from home on an upcoming trip expected to last few weeks. And seeing the current price and purchasing options available the Kindle HDX seemed to be an easy choice to me.  Even with my thinking I understood the tablets limitations.The things that attracted me to the Kindle HDX tab, were the processor, it's 4 G LTE compatibility with Verizon, and the fact that I am an Amazon Prime member. I had read that Amazon was expecting people to use their online services for video and music so having membership I was not too concerned about the small amount of storage on the tablet. But that was a mistake on my part. I was thinking I would be able to access the movies that I purchased online with Amazons instant video, and expected to be able to access the 128 gigs of music I have stored on Google Play\", but Google Play media will not load on my Kindle HDX. Amazons cloud does store music up to a point, but it is limited in how much you can store free of charge.  There is an option to purchase additional storage, (I believe it's about $25 a year with other limitations). But the free storage is limited and in my case I've been buying music from Amazon since the 1990's and a lot of my music was displaced by newer purchases without my knowing. So now I'm forced to either purchase additional space or be satisfied with what's there. Personally I feel the additional $25 is a rip off since particularly since the purchase of the kindle and considering my Prime membership, and with other services offer free unlimited uploads of music Amazon seems pretty greedy at this pont.Here are the things I like about the current Kindle HDX Verizon compatible version.1. The processor, it is very fast and loads pages quickly, and the 2 gigs of ram is a respectable amount to assist in performance.2. The variables in personal settings, make the device easy to personalize.3. The display is very nice and video and video games look great, but noting as others have there is a blue cast around the edges which is very noticeable when reading from the device.The not so great things about the Kindle HDX 16 GB.1. The fact that the device does not support storage expansion. It bothers me that my old Droid Bionic cell phone has a SanDisk slot that will let me to expand storage to 64 gigs, but you're stuck with the memory provided on the Kindle you purchase.2. The lack of an HDMI port and to watch TV, you have to purchase a separate device provided and sold by Amazon.3. The Lack of even a mini USB port. Again my old Droid telephone provides a USB port and offers a charging device with a built in USB hub that allows me to connect to any number of external attachments, and this tablet does not.Regretfully the impact of these limitations did not come to mind when I bought the Kindle, but would have if I knew the fully understood the tablets limitations.Would I recommend this tablet to friends or family? Only if they were a member of Amazons Prime services and fully understood its limitations, including storage and the area support of their carrier.So over all, for basic users or those wanting a reading device with very nice options living in an area with Wi-Fi and who have good 4 G coverage the Kindle would probably be an OK purchase. But only if they are fully aware of the limitations of this tablet. Especially the limitations of the tablets onboard storage. 16 gigs is just too little to carry much media with you, with the device using a large part of that 16 gigs, for it's UI and OS you are not even getting a full 16 gigs (more like 10). Then tablet not supporting SanDisk memory expansion (which seems contrived to me), leaves the user too dependent on Amazons premium services for my tastes.(Update 4/14/14) The packet blocking used to keep people tied to Amazons Media Content (or at least their Music App) needs to be removed. In my review above, I mentioned that I have had issues accessing my music stored on My Google Play Music site. But at that time I wasn't sure that this was my being impatient, not waiting for the site to load completely even though I did wait for five minutes, or if it was Amazon using packet blocking and redirection to keep people tied to their services. More recently I found that when trying to access my music on the Google site I was redirected to  the \" My Books Recommendations\". I believe the Kindle site offers better deals, and has a wider selection than Googles offerings, but Googles music site includes downloads at the same cost and higher resolution (320 Kbps vs. the 190-240 Kbps at Amazon). More over recently a few friends told me they have run into the same issue when trying to access their media stored at other various sites (that are either free or that do not charge what Amazon does for their \"Premium Cloud Services\").As someone else has mentioned in their review of the Kindle. Amazon has included adds on the Kindle HDX that are not present on other tablets (even basic inexpensive Android tablets do not have invasive adds). If I pay Amazon another fee I understand I can have those adds removed. But all of these fees really add up, and it seems to me that since I've already paid for this device, these additional fee's, and packet blocking with proprietary redirection are unacceptable and possibly illegal. Who Gives amazon the right to block content and force you to view advertisements on a device of this nature!At this point I would honestly suggest looking elsewhere unless your absolutely sure that the problems mentioned above will not come into play for you or the one you are purchasing this device for. The idea of an e-reader with expanded abilities is one thing, but to advertise the Kindle HDX as a tablet able to compete with an I-Pad, and then throw things like site redirection, packet blocking to limit access media storage to their proprietary services makes me wish I had purchased anything other than this device.", "Date": "March 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Happy with it, especially for the price", "Author": "MichaelB", "ReviewID": "R2Y0383TNKPC18", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was debating between Ipad mini and this HDX 7. My home computer is a Mac and my music, contacts and calendar are all on the Mac. I read by eBooks on Kindle touch and like to watch Amazon prime movies. So I am sort of in two worlds. At the end of the day I opted to give this a try based upon price (I got the 15% off price when Amazon had the FAA thank you special). So what do I think, well if you are used to Mac products it is hard to beat their ease of use and how you just plug it in and all your stuff automatically synchs up. The Kindle fire took me a bit to organize and set up although it was nice that all of my books came over from my Touch to the HDX, although they are placed in the Cloud and you have to download the ones you want on your device. Also any books you set up yourself go to your documents tab and not the books tab. I dealt with calendar problem by exporting Ical into Google calendar which does automatically import to the HDX calendar. I was sort of annoyed that you had to buy basic applications that come with an Ipad such as clock and notepad. Since there are several options for these you have to hunt around, read reviews etc. Also - \"free aps\" all come with ads, which is sort of annoying so I would recommend you consider getting the \"upgraded versions\" to avoid ads. Several people have complained about the light blue border on the reader - I noticed it but got quickly used to it and it does not bother me. Watching movies works for me - the 7\" screen is probably similar to watching a movie in the seat back screens of an airplane. Battery life is ok - probably need to recharge every other day with normal use.

Last May, I abandoned my first generation Kindle Fire for a brief affair with an Asus Google Nexus tablet. Sure, it was good looking and seemed to work just fine but in the end it left me feeling empty and cold...and feeling guilty for cheating on Amazon just because there's no Microsoft OneNote app available for Kindle. Four months of very little Amazon love had me begging to come back - and when the HDX was announced, I found my chance and grabbed one. I'll learn to love the Evernote app instead of OneNote, but please never separate me from Amazon again. \u00a2\u00beThe display is breathtakingly sharp and beautiful. It's such a great picture that I had trouble focusing on the movie because I was in awe over how clear and sharp the image on the screen was. Hubby caught me staring at it with my yap wide open, a frozen expression of awe on my face. (I think he might have been a little too happy to find me speechless.)The sound is phenomenal, especially for such a little device. I really didn't think there would be much difference between the Google 7 tablet mentioned above and the Kindle Fire HDX but there is a HUGE difference. I'm so glad. This little bad boy puts all other tablets to shame. When the sound started playing out the speakers I flipped it over and started looking for them...I have no idea why or what I expected to find, but the amazing quality of sound blew me away. It was almost surround sound-ish, if you know what I mean.The Fire works the same as I remember with my first one. There's a carousel containing your most recently viewed content and a favorites section below. I wish there was a way to store my content in categories like the old Kindle Keyboard. I miss being able to put all my reference books together, all my fiction together, and so on - but I'm told that there's a software update coming in mid-November that will allow us to do just that. Again...I love you, Amazon!I bought the Fire with ads on it, which isn't like it sounds at all. There are no pop ups in the middle of what you're reading/doing/watching. The screensaver provides suggestions is all. That's it. And there's a very tiny window underneath the carousel that suggests content similar to what you're reading/doing/watching already. I actually like it...because I might miss something otherwise. It's very non-intrusive (is that a word?) and I have no issues with it.Ease of set up is amazing as always. Amazon is truly a customer friendly company and I will never stray again. I am so happy to be back in the fold of happy Amazon customers. This is the best purchase I've made all year.

It has a very sharp screen, it's very easy to use, and the price is right. It's the best tablet to consume Amazon content (along with the larger 8.9\" Fire HDX tablet) and one of the two best 7\" tablets for the price (along with the Google Nexus 7).At the end of the review, I compare the HDX to two other tablets you might be considering, which are the newest version of the Kindle Fire HD and newest version of the Google Nexus 7.If you own the previous version of the Fire HD and are thinking of upgrading, the two main differences are the HDX eliminated the HDMI port and added the ability the download some Prime movies and TV shows. If you are happy with your Fire HD, unless you really need to download movies and TV shows, I don't think there are enough improvements in the HDX to warrant buying it.The Fire HDX is primarily designed to use content from Amazon, like videos and books. If you have a Prime membership, you also have access to all the free Prime videos, many of which you can now download, instead of only streaming them.  However, Amazon's app selection is weak. So make sure you check that the apps you want are available from Amazon before buying this tablet.SETUP - Some people have complained about having difficulty setting up some of the older Kindle tablets. For me, the setup of the Fire HDX was quick and easy. It only took a minute or two to get going, then I entered in my Amazon account information and I was good to go. No problems at all.SIZE AND WEIGHT AND HOLDABILITY - At 7.3\" x 5.0\" x .35\", it's one of the smallest 7\" tablets.  At only 10.7 ounces, it's light enough to hold for extended periods of time. The back is a hard rubber, which is rubbery enough not to be slippery, but not so rubbery that it's mushy.SCREEN - The HDX has a 1920 x 1200 screen. The quality of the screen is as good as the 1920 x 1200 screen on the Nexus 7, and better than every other 7\" tablet I've tried.  I especially appreciate the ability of the high-res screen to show small text very clearly, which is helpful when browsing the internet.I like bright screens, but the HDX screen was actually too bright at 100% brightness. So I turned it back down to a brightness of about 75% which is bright enough without being too bright.The only problem I have with the screen is that it is very reflective, easily the most reflective tablet I've ever used. The reflections are the worst when the screen is mainly black, which happens often because the main screen of the tablet is black. I eventually figured out that if you angle the tablet slightly away from you, or slightly toward you, much of the reflection is eliminated.SOUND - The speakers are in the back. I would prefer them in the front. In any case, even though the sound is going away from you, the speakers are still loud enough. The sound quality is decent, but nothing special.WI-FI STRENGTH - The Fire HDX has two Wi-Fi antennas which are supposed to give it better Wi-Fi connectivity than most other devices that have only one antenna. I walked around my house with the HDX, the Nexus 7, and two cell phones and the HDX usually had one more bar of signal strength than the other three devices did.When close to my router, all the devices were able to load websites at about the same speed. When I was much farther away from the router, the HDX had a slight speed advantage.ON/OFF BUTTON - The On/Off button is on the back of the tablet on the left side. It's located pretty close to where I put my hand when I'm holding the tablet.  I have already accidentally turned the tablet off three times. Really annoying.When I'm trying to turn it on, it's quicker to turn the tablet over to find the On/Off button.  I think that having the On/Off button on either the front or the side, like most tablets do, would have been much better.Some tablets and smart phones have an On/Off button that needs to be held down for 1 or 2 seconds in order to turn off. Not this tablet. Hit the On/Off button accidentally for even a tenth of a second and it turns off.The volume button is also on the back, on the right side. That didn't bother me as much, because I don't need to change the volume that often. And even if I hit it accidentally and make the volume go up or down, that is a lot less annoying than accidentally hitting the On/Off switch and turning the tablet off in the middle of reading a book or watching a movie.DOWNLOAD AMAZON PRIME VIDEOS - AWESOME!In my opinion, this is the best thing that Amazon has added to their new HDX and HD tablets. In the past, if you wanted to download a movie or TV show, you had to buy it. But now you can download some Prime movies and TV shows and watch them when you aren't connected to the internet. They stay on your tablet for 30 days, at which point Amazon deletes them whether or not you've watched them. (If you have already started watching it, and you try to watch it away from a Wi-Fi connection, you only get another 15 days to finish watching it before it gets deleted.)Be aware that Amazon has not secured the download rights to all Prime movies. In fact, only about 30% of the Prime movies I wanted to download were downloadable. But there are still plenty to choose from. Also, quite a few TV shows that are a few years old can be downloaded for free.The internet at my house is somewhat flaky, always seeming to cut out for a minute or two right at the most exciting part of a movie. Now, whenever possible, I'm going to download the movie to my tablet, and then watch it from the download. That way, I never have to worry about the streaming being interrupted. So I don't find the new ability to download Prime videos only useful on the road. I will be using it at home as well.EASE OF USE - I think that Kindles are the easiest tablets to use.  The top row on the home screen has options like \"Books\"  \"Music\"  \"Videos\"  and \"Web.\"  Even if you've never used a tablet before, as long as you can read, you can figure it out.Amazon is making a big deal about their new Mayday customer service that will bring a live person onto the screen of your Kindle HDX to teach you where things are and how to use the tablet. It's an interesting idea, but I don't think most people will need it. This tablet is pretty easy to figure out by yourself.BLUETOOTH - The HDX has Bluetooth and it works fine. I don't know what else to say about it.SPECIAL OFFERS - If you are worried that \"special offers\" means you are consistently bombarded with ads, don't worry. An ad only appears one time when you turn the tablet on.  As soon as you go to the next screen, there are no more ads. (Hopefully Amazon doesn't change this down the road and start bombarding me with ads.)PARENTAL CONTROLS - There are a few different ways parents can restrict their kids' use, like limiting them to a certain amount of time, or restricting certain categories, like video games for example.APPS - On a Kindle, apps should be spelled \"oops.\" As in \"Oops, there aren't very many of them.\" Right now, there are about 1 million Android apps, and on the Kindle you can only get about 10% of them.I know some people think \"10% of 1 million apps is still 100,000 apps which is plenty.\" Well, that depends.  Let's say an app that is really important to you, like the app for your bank so you can do banking through your tablet, isn't available on the Kindle. If you thought it would be available, but after buying the HDX you find out it isn't, you probably won't be too happy.So double check Amazon's app selection before buying this tablet.OTHER DOWNSIDES - The HDMI port that existed in the previous Kindle HD no longer exists.  (I say \"previous\" because the current Kindle HD also doesn't have an HDMI port.)  The HDMI port was useful to show videos from your tablet on your TV. Instead of using an HDMI cable, the Fire HDX now has the ability to mirror your tablet screen to Miracast enabled TVs and devices. I don't have Miracast anything, so that isn't helping me. Adding Miracast to the tablet is fine, but I would have liked to also have an HDMI port.There is no SD card slot, so there is no way to expand the memory after you buy it. Which leads into the next thing which is how many GB of memory you will need.16GB vs 32GB vs 64GB VERSIONSI downloaded several HD videos at the highest HD setting (there is more than one HD quality setting) and they took up about 1.7 GB of storage per hour of video. I realize that other HD videos may be a little more or less GB per hour, but using 1.7 GB per hour as a rough guide, here is the maximum amount of HD video you can download:16GB  (10.9GB available) - 6.4 hours32GB  (25.1GB available) - 14.7 hours64GB  (53.7GB available) - 31.5 hoursThe worst standard definition videos I found took up 330MB (which is .33 GB) of storage per hour. So multiply the hours above by 5 to get an estimate of the maximum number of hours of SD videos you can download. Once again, this is a just a rough estimate, because other standard definition videos may take up a little more or a little less MB per hour.FIRE HDX vs FIRE HD  (THE NEW HD, NOT THE OLD HD)The HDX is a fraction of an inch smaller and 1.5 ounces lighter than the HD. The difference was so small that it didn't really matter to me.The Kindle HDX screen (1920 x 1200) has a higher resolution than the Kindle HD screen (1280 x 800). With movies and books I couldn't tell the difference. Both tablets looked equally great. The only time I noticed the difference was browsing the internet. Trying to squeeze all, or most, of a web page into a 7\" screen makes the text pretty small, and the HDX did a better job than the HD of making small text very crisp and easy to read. Although I must say that the HD was still pretty good.The HDX has a camera and microphone and the HD doesn't. Even if you don't plan on taking photos or videos, the lack of a camera and mic means you can't do any kind of internet calling, like Skype, for example.The HDX has the new \"Mayday\" feature which lets you contact Amazon customer service right from the screen of your tablet. The HD doesn't have this.The HDX has a faster processor. I didn't notice any difference between the two tablets while reading books, watching videos, or browsing the internet.  The HDX is probably better than the HD for playing video games. However, since I'm not into video games, that's something I didn't try on either tablet.The HDX comes in either WiFi or WiFi/4G versions, while the HD only has a WiFi version.Some people think that only the HDX has the ability to download Amazon Prime Videos, but actually both tablets can do that.FIRE HDX vs GOOGLE NEXUS 7  (THE NEW 2013 VERSION)The hardware is similar. Same screen resolution (1920 x 1200), about the same weight, and both have a camera and a mic.The Nexus 7 is taller and narrower than the HDX, which makes the Nexus 7 slightly easier to hold in one hand. (By \"one hand\" I mean with your thumb on one side and your 4 fingers on the other side.)The Fire HDX has a faster processor, but I didn't notice a difference in speed when actually using the tablets. The Nexus 7 has both a rear and a front camera, while the Fire HDX only has a front camera. The Nexus 7 has GPS and the Fire HDX doesn't.But I think that the most important differences are what you can do with it.The main features that the Fire HDX has that the Nexus 7 doesn't - The HDX has the Mayday customer support feature and the ability to download Amazon Prime Videos.The main feature that the Nexus 7 has that the Fire HDX doesn't - The Nexus 7 has all the apps in the Google Play store, as well as GPS.So you'll have to decide what's more important to you. Amazon Prime Videos in general and the ability to download them in particular?  Or the ability to use every Android app that exists as well as GPS?CONCLUSIONThe Fire HDX is a very good tablet. It has a great screen, it's lightweight, and the price is right. All its missing is GPS, a camera on the back, and about 1 million Android apps.Why did I buy the Fire HDX? Well, I already have a very nice Android phone, which has a camera on the back and GPS. I always have my phone with me, so if I need to use GPS or an app, I do that on my phone. I don't need GPS or a bunch of apps on my tablet.I bought the Fire HDX because it's better than my phone for watching videos, reading books, and browsing the internet. Throw in the fact that I can now download lots of Prime movies and TV shows, and I'm happy with this tablet.But before buying this tablet, or any Kindle tablet for that matter, you should make sure that the apps you need are available on the Kindle. There are a number of important apps, such as apps from Google, apps from banks, etc. that you might want to use. The other major Android tablets, like the Samsung Galaxy tablets and the Google Nexus 7, have all those apps, while Kindles only have a fraction of them.If you want a high-quality tablet for watching videos, playing music, reading books and magazines, and going online, this tablet will work fine.

For the seniors that sometime shy away from electronics this is for you.  You will find in just a few minutes you will be able to use all the functions of the HDX 7 with ease.  I do suggest a stylus, case and screen protector (in my other reviews).  I had to use the MAYDAY feature - I didn't need it I just wanted to try it - what a great feature and simple to use.

I haven't gotten to use a 3G feature yet, but this tablet finds a WiFi connection where my Surface Pro, other tablets and even my powerful laptops can't get it.It's got great apps, the screen is stunning (looks better than the last iPad Air or Surface Pro 2), and its drop test rating is one of the better ones.

So, if I can do it, so can you.  I am a voracious reader and was anxious to see the \"blue haze\" so many people talked about.  Personally, I cannot understand the complaints.  Yes, there is a very faint blue border, but not enough to bother mentioning (to me).  I am absolutely astounded at what this device is capable of.  I spent several hours experimenting and I realize there will be a learning curve, but I'm having fun with it.  I've used a Nook for the last two years and have slowly grown discontented with its performance.  When placed side-by-side, the Kindle wins in weight, brightness, speed and features.

I've used others in the past, and I never could get past how slow they operate; however, Kindle Fire HDX is an exception. While I'm not familiar with other operating systems, I will say that Fire OS is very smooth. I will admit there were some bugs while working the device. For instance, I have run into a few occasions where it has crashed and restarted. I have also run into situations where I've had to reinstall apps for them to work properly again. In time, I'm sure they'll fix these issues with updates.With respect to the apps that are available for this tablet, you'll might be disappointed. I'm more of a gamer, so going onto Amazon to find out that some of the apps I wanted aren't available to the Kindle yet. This is rather unfortunate, considering a number of these apps have been out for quite some time already. Basically, Amazon doesn't have the same broad selection you would typically find in the Apple Appstore or Google Play. Though it might be common knowledge, apps from the Appstore or Google Play aren't compatible with the Kindle. On the plus side, Amazon does release a free app each day, so that makes developing your collection easier.I've also tested some of the new features that came with the Fire OS 3.1 upgrade, including second screen and Miracast. Second screen allows you to take movies and TV shows from Amazon, and lets you play your selection wirelessly on a nearby television, assuming you have either a Playstation 3 or 2013 Samsung TVs connected. Bear in mind that second screen is only available to amazon content, nothing from netflix, hulu, or any other online streaming services. Ironically, TV Sideview (Sony's app that allows you to control Sony devices from your tablet, including the PS3) isn't compatible w/ the Kindle either. As a result, you'll have to navigate your system on both your controller and the Kindle, at least until, and this is assuming, TV Sideview becomes available for the Kindle.Miracast is a much better version of Second Screen, as this allows you to wirelessly display what you're doing on your kindle onto a nearby television or media streaming device, as long as it is Miracast compatible and compatible with your Kindle. For those of you who have familiarized yourself with Chromecast, just a heads up: it's not compatible with the Kindle. I ended up using the NETGEAR Push2TV Wireless Display HDMI Adapter - Miracast and WiDi (PTV3000) (link provided below) to test Miracast, and I have to say that if you want to use your Kindle to stream content onto your TV, this is the way to go. It displays in HD, the sound quality is superb, and anything you do on your kindle can be placed on your TV. **Gamers, if you're expecting to play games in this fashion, bear in mind that there is likely going to be lag time between the commands you input into the tablet and the miracast compatible device. This doesn't affect anything other than games, however, as the sound and video output on your TV will be synchronized during use. Thus, if you want responsive controls, I don't recommend miracast for gamers.There was one more update that came with Fire OS 3.1, and that is Goodreads. Unfortunately, I'm not too familiar with it. All I know is that it's an amazon app that allows you to share what you've read, provide recommendations, and look at what your friends and other people are reading. Readers, you'll probably find this resourceful. I know some of my friends love it.Overall, the Kindle has the power and graphics to provide you with a great quality experience; however, the selection of apps do pale in comparison to other devices. While it's not perfect, it still provides the same functions you would find in other tablets (some of which are better). If you have to have all of the latest apps, especially the ones that accompany big games, such as GTA V and Injustice (Which has been added since I 1st wrote this review. Still took them most of this year though.), you'll surely be disappointed.Helpful tip for closing apps on your Kindle Fire HDX:Some of you might not know how to close apps on your Kindle, and a number of pages on the web recommends force stopping apps to close them; however, that could damage the data. Assuming an app doesn't have an option to exit the app, just use the back button on the main screen of the app. If the app doesn't allow you to exit that way, then the developers never developed an exit button for their app. Then you'll have to force stop it to keep it from running in the background and avoid eating up some of that precious CPU usage. Hope that was helpful! It might've been common knowledge, but I would not know, as this is my 1st tablet ever, as mentioned previously.To use miracast for your Kindle Fire HDX and television, I recommend:NETGEAR Push2TV Wireless Display HDMI Adapter - Miracast and WiDi (PTV3000)B00904JILO", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Prime video download a joke", "Author": "Patriot1", "ReviewID": "R3MLJ9YWG0SFQP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I upgraded to the HDX for three reasons.

I am very disappointed and am in conversation with tech support. First, the good: brilliant color, speed, much improved speakers, and the button placement is ideal for on/off and volume. \"Mr. Hyde\" appears in the reading, at least on my device, in a slowly-advancing glowing blue border! I know- the notice has gone out that this is \"normal\" and part of the advancement in true color display, but my device border is irregular, blotchy, and prevents any enjoyment of reading despite adjustments of brightness, font, etc.Amazon customer support is stellar, but I've had some difficulty conveying the fact that this display is unacceptable. Past experience with support has been very positive, so I won't let Jekyl and Hyde dissuade me.More to come....**10/30/13 Kindle support consented to sending a replacement. This second HDX does not have the unevenly lit border, but is \"shadowy\" even with the sepia background, which I find easier on the eyes. The HDX doesn't come close to the reading experience of the Fire HD that I traded in, but I'll live with this because any other e-readers I've tested have backlit displays that are far worse!I would advise you keep your Fire HDs if you enjoy reading.

My first tablet was an iPad 1st gen. I liked it, but it was too restrictive & locked down. Since then I've owned the following: Google Nexus 7 (original), Amazon Kindle Fire (original), Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7\", Motorola Xoom (original), HP TouchPad (WebOS fire sale), PanDigital Novel 7, few generic Chinese eBay (all of which sucked BTW), Barnes & Nobel Nook HD+ (still have, gave it to my mom when I ordered the HDX) & now the just released Amazon Kindle Fire HDX 7\" 32GB.Honestly I didn't know what too expect with the HDX, all the specs were awesome & it's kicking serious butt against the Nexus 7 (2013) in various benchmarks, but I was still kinda nervous. I knew the HDX would be high-quality & well made, Amazon doesn't put out anything, but well made devices.It arrived yesterday, it's a lot smaller than I thought it was going to be, but the difference is the HDX doesn't have all the wasted space usually found in the bezel areas of most tablets, it's minimalistic in design. Very much a welcomed change!By reducing the wasted bezel space, Amazon has not only made the tablet lighter, it's very easy to hold in one hand.The true full 1080p HD display has blown me away!!! I have never seen such clarity, vivid full spectrum extremely accurate color reproduction, flawless crisp clean & incredibly smooth video. Honestly, no matter what I say, this is one of those things you have too see to fully appreciate. There is no blurry, pixelated motion distortion you find in some HD TV's.Combined with true Dolby sound, which somehow manages too reproduce a very life like surround sound experience. I haven't figured out how the HDX pulls this off, but the sound is phenomenal.You definitely notice the quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor under the hood, as this thing flies!Amazon's re-built from the ground up newly minted Fire OS 3.0, is a work of art. It's fast, very user friendly, gorgeous graphics & integrates very smoothly with the content available from Amazon Prime. You can easily find anything & everything you may be looking for.Amazon's app store is rapidly catching up to Google Play & I have been able to find all the apps I use from the Google Play store.The integrated apps, such as e-mail, calendar etc. was surprisingly easy to setup with my Gmail & Google Calendar.Amazon has most definitely hit a massive homerun with the HDX line. Apple & Google have serious competition this time around.Don't second guess yourself if you are considering the HDX, it's an absolute no regret purchase. You will absolutely love the HDX. And YES, the HDX really does have the best & highest quality HD display currently available.After seeing what the Snapdragon 800 CPU & Adreno 330 GPU are capable of, I now see why Google is using both in the upcoming Nexus 5.

She didn't understand a word of English, she made me go through her checklist of trouble shooting, even though she had a record of me speaking with tech service.

I do pay for Amazon Prime membership as well as Kindle Freetime Unlimited for kids.Ok, with that out of the way, allow me to share with you my impressions:Device layout/Handling-----------------------WEIGHT: It feels really light! I measured on my digital scale which showed 10.6oz (300g)VOLUME CONTROL: I actually like the volume up/down on the back where my right fingers can conveniently adjust without losing grip. If these buttons can be re-mapped, then racing games will be at another level with \"paddle shifters!\"POWER BUTTON: I am neutral on its location (left rear). Users can get confused with volume buttons on the other side. Also, once the Origami case is put on, there would not be a need to hit the power button at all since opening/closing cover will do the job automagically.Display/Audio--------------TEXT: very sharp - can see the difference with its improved pixel density. Not sure it'll help improve the reader's vision, but certainly it is very pleasant and easy on the eye. Almost as pleasant as Kindle Paperwhites, but with color!VIDEO: I side-loaded a 1080p movie clip, and it looked real good as it should. Most people will not put big 1080p movies with 16-32GB storage. Downloaded 720p HD videos are fine, but they won't blow anyone away compared to similar tablets on the market.GRAPHICS: very smooth and clean rendering with no lag for fast action games like Real Racing 3 and Asphalt 8. Icons for Apps, movies, and music albums all look sharper. The only negative I found with such high resolution is some older color kids books are image-based, so a full page on older Kindle Fire now look tiny on the HDX display.AUDIO: Very impressive stereo fidelity! I can hear the pleasant difference compare to the Fire HD, but may not be as loud. Sound reflects nicely when laid flat on my kitchen counter.CAMERA: only front-facing camera which looks fine with proper lighting. Nothing breakthrough here. Maybe someday there can be a nigh-vision camera as part of the x-ray feature set...LOLBattery Life--------------STANDBY: full to drained in 4 days - just under 100 hours with email and notification check once a day.ACTIVE USE: I got past 6 hours of web browsing, listen to music, and watching videos before I had to retire (approx 50% juice left)Software/System----------------STABILITY: no hang-and-reboot has occurred so far. This happened a few times on my Fire HD. The pad is warm to touch after a while but not hot.WI-FI/Bluetooth: works well like the Fire HDs.X-Ray: Music lyrics is very cool and I love it. This feature shows up on many of the MP3 albums purchased from Amazon. Usefulness in Kindle books depend on the content. Movies? Works like having an interactive blu-ray session, which I don't find it as useful. As expected, my personal uploaded music are not \"x-rayed\" for lyrics.QUIET TIME: Saw \"Quiet Time\" button next to \"Mayday\" and didn't know what it is, so I pressed \"Mayday\" to find out. Quiet time is to \"mute\" notification and others that cause audibles, but does not mute the sound from music, games, or other apps.MAYDAY: got a male operator within 15 seconds. He did require me to verify my email address, name on the account, and billing address. I asked him how would my kids be able to use this feature when I issue them the new Kindle HDX?  He said \"good question\" and will pass it on...So just a heads-up that the operator will need certain info.SILK: Browser runs fast as is. This is NOT always the case with Fire HD, where the browser can crawl like a turtle unless the \"Accelerate Page Loading\" is turned off. So looks like the developers fixed this to perform as advertised. I hope that will give Fire HD's software an update also.Summary--------For Kindle users: The HDX is a good incremental upgrade to Fire HD. The major improvements underneath don't surface as much for general users. But for owners of the first generation Kindle Fire, upgrade to HDX is significant.For non Kindle tablet owners: Kindle devices greatly enhance experience with Amazon's offerings with e-books, music hosting, instant videos, magazines, and especially for Prime members.

This was a mistake.At first I did this because I am a Prime member, and an Amazon device is really the only way to get access to the streaming video on a tablet, or the lending library option.  However, these additional options do not make up for what I lost.  By this I mean, I can't (easily) get any Google apps installed on the device.  If you want a legitimate version of any Google product, or many other Google play apps, you cannot install it without a side-load situation.  My problem with that is that apks are then downloaded by non-store sites, this means they might be out of date, or even hacked.  I chose the path of least resistance and just sent it back.  I've got better things to do with my time that hack a product right out of the box.  While this means you don't get access to the actual G-mail app, Google Earth, Google+, and YouTube, the loss that hurt me the most was the inability to install Chrome.  Chrome has all my bookmarks, and I had little desire to painstakingly re-enter all those into the silk browser.The hardware is nice, the interface runs smooth, and the high res icons that consume the better part of the main menu are surprisingly beautiful.  However, I found it annoying that under those icons, you'll be force fed amazon purchase suggestions based upon on what icon is centered.  I bought the Kindle without the \"special offers\" for a reason, so this subtle solicitation bothered me.Ultimately the Kindle feels only slightly less locked down than an iPhone/iPad, which is exactly the same reason why I don't buy those Apple products.  I want my device to be free to get apps from multiple (legitimate) sources.  And I want that functionality to exist out of the box.  It's interesting that my Nexus 7 can easily get the Amazon app store installed, but the Kindle could not easily have given me access to the Google Play store.I ended up replacing this with a Nexus 7 2013, which lamentably has a slightly slower processor, but at least I'm not in for any of these proprietary surprises.  Maybe I've just been spoiled by my other Android devices.If Kindle allows Google apps to be able to be installed through a front-door option, I would gladly revisit the Kindle hardware, it is still a nice piece of equipment.", "Date": "November 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wish I'd known about this sooner!", "Author": "ALAN J FARRELL", "ReviewID": "RN1NLQ6EULDID", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great product.

When Kindle Fire came out he bought one of those. Loved it. Bought my daughter the Kindle Fire HD for Christmas when they came out (she's not in the home so I don't count hers as being in our home). My husband then bought the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\". He watches videos on it all of the time. Amazon had a special around Super Bowl time so I bought the Kindle Fire HDX with 4G. Love it. It has frozen on me a couple of times but all you have to do is shut it down. This doesn't bother me because my iPhone and laptops have frozen also. There are some apps that are not available through Amazon but there are other ways to get most of the apps you want with investigation. I would really love to have Adobe Flash because some sites only use Flash for their videos, and one of those sites I pay $$ yearly to watch videos (yoga) but can't on the HDX, but I can on the Kindle Fire HD. I think that it is not Amazon's fault that Flash is not available on the Kindle, it has something to do with Adobe.When I took my new Kindle to Verizon they told me that the Kindle doesn't have 4G. Had to explain that it did. So then the guy tried to connect it - and it worked. He was VERY excited. He was telling all the other associates that Kindle has a 4G tablet. None of them knew. One of the associates had to call a lady back in because she told the customer that Kindle could not connect to 4G.This tablet is great. I've never used another brand, but I have watched others use theirs and I really don't see much difference, except maybe for the apps. And right now I have the apps I use.There is one negative to this device. It doesn't like to charge on any chargers/cables except the \"Kindle\" brand.

I mainly wanted it to read books on, which it definitely fulfills the purpose. Prior to this, I had been using a Nook Color that I bought 2 or 3 years ago to read books on. It has been discontinued, and of course due to Amazon's cheaper book prices, as much as I read, I.figured the Kindle would pay for itself in books over time.Pros:I love the way it feels in my hands. It's comfortable. It feels like I could actually be reading a lightweight book. It is much more lightweight than the Nook Color, despite having a screen the same size. A lot of people have said that the Kindle can have a glare when outside reading, which is why one should opt for the paperwhite instead. I took my kindle fire HDX fishing yesterday and read perfectly without glare, which I think may have something to do with my reading settings being set to look like  dark page with white writing on it. You can also change it to a white page with black writing, as normal, or to sepia. I love that it tells me how finished I am with a book (like 45% finished with book). That alone means a lot, because the Nook did not do that at all. The sound on the HDX is phenomenal. It sounds like I am sitting in a surround sound movie theater. My Nook Color, iPad Mini, Samsung Galaxy S4, nothing I have owned this far in the tablet and phone world has sounded as awesome as the HDX. I love the predictive keyboard, which to me is similar to my iPad minis, because I can make a lot of mistakes typing quickly. I enjoy the app selection. It is much much more than my nook color ever offered. I am a medical professional and must have epocrates installed on my device. It was right there for free in the app store and works beautifully on this device. I like the fact that if Amazon's store does not have any app I want, I can sideload it. I have only had my HDX for a few days, however, and have not found any apps to be missing thus far. So I have  not had to sideload anything yet. I hear it is not that difficult. The screen is also great and very hi def. I am not sure if it outranks my iPad though. They seem similar to me. I like how quickly the HDX loads movies,videos, and games without lag or having to reload.Cons: the ads you have to pay $15 to get rid of (but I sometimes enjoy seeing what they're offering. It prompts me to look at books I may have not consideredd before). The fact that you can't change the background of the screens home to anything you want. The poor quality front facing only camera on it.

You have little or no control over the information they can access on your kindle or amazon.  It seems to me that Amazon does not value the privacy of our personal information. Some Apps even make you agree to allow them to share PERSONAL INFORMATION with other advertisers and \"partners\" before allowing you to install.  If you don\u2019t agree, you cannot install.  The Facebook Application terms that are levied by amazon/Facebook are egregious, so I won\u2019t install that app.The Special offers are not so special...Basically they hold your screen saver hostage with advertisements and movie promos.  If you want to remove them, it will cost you a fee.  (I think $15) Therefore, ads come with the Kindle.Bottom Line:  They have a great product here and they know it, I would have rated it a 5 Star if not for the BS.

In comparison to the original Fire, the HDX is much lighter, thinner, has reduced glare and the screen clarity and picture is incredible! The sound is also much better and louder. I like how much faster the processor and Wi-Fi are too! If you own the first Fire, I highly suggest you upgrade to the HDX. The only thing that takes some getting used to is the buttons and their location. I think Amazon has a winner here - this little device is amazing and is an excellent buy for the money!One thing to note: there is much talk about a blue haze around the edges of the screen when viewing a white background. Maybe it is worse on some devices, but I had to really look to see it on mine. It is barely noticeable, to be honest. If yours is really bad, get a replacement.

For the price of a Kindle Fire HDX, you will not find anything better. I'm not a techno-wiz or anything like that, I've merely had the opportunity to use different types of tablets since members of my family keep winning them in drawings (e.g. Galaxy tab, Nexus, iPad, iPad mini). I actually bought this one because I wanted a tablet and it was less than half the price of the others when Amazon gave me special offers.I was initially worried about how complicated it might be to use, especially since I'm more familiar with the iPad interface, but I found the Kindle to be quite easy to operate. If I ever had a problem, I'd have the best customer support in seconds with the 'Mayday' button.It's fast- it's never really had a lag for anything that I've tried. The buttons are out of the way, but easy to find and use. The sound is by far superior to all other tablets, as is the display. It also feels better in the hand then other tablets.As with all non-iOS products, it doesn't have all of the apps or usability that I'd like, but that will come with time. Two notable apps that are absent from the market are Youtube and Instagram. I'm sure more developers will jump on board, especially since this tablet has proven to be extremely usable.If you are looking for larger text or screen size, the 7\" might be a bit too small. Also, if you aren't an Amazon Prime member, the Kindle might not have as many perks (e.g. instant video, lending library, etc). However, it still is great as a standalone tablet (although I'd recommend using the Prime services with your Kindle if you choose to purchase it; they are definitely worth the price).All in all, it's a top-tier competitor in the tablet market and it's also one of the cheapest. If you're considering this and the iPad mini or Nexus, really look into the Kindle or try it out.UPDATE (December 2013)I finally had the opportunity to use the Mayday service due to a downloading issue. It was about 10:30 PM. I tapped the Mayday button and within ten seconds I was in video contact with a representative from Amazon. In less than five minutes, they were able to visually show me the issue with my tablet and help me to solve it. I understood every word that they said (it wasn't outsourced) and it was by far the best tech-issue customer service contact I've ever had. I can usually solve any issues on my own, but having this feature for the times when I'm stuck is very nice.Many other reviews have mentioned the display issues at the border. It's true, it isn't perfect, but I don't think its incredibly distracting (granted, I don't read with it alot).

For starters, the blue \"glare\" that is mentioned around the edge of the screen is there. I don't think its so horrible that you won't be able to read on the white screen. You can also change the text background in your books for example. you can read on a black background with white letters and the blue glare goes away. However, I received my kindle today and its already being shipped back. I don't think its a great buy for the price, yes the specs are great however the new Google nexus tablet is the same price for 32gb a frontal and back camera along with HD viewing capabilities. Further every tablet can download the kindle app or some type of e-reader app for books. The kindle tablet has limited access to the app market where android and apple are almost pretty equal. Amazon talks up a great game with this tablet, but I don't think it owns up to the price. Lastly I bought this to use almost as a portable laptop because I read you can VIEW Microsoft office documents. I first mis-read this for using Microsoft office. The kindle does not offer such a feature you can only simply view these things.

Wireless connects well and the tablet streams videos without a hitch.  I'm very excited to see how Amazon is going to take advantage of the Miracast technology built into the tablet.  I expect to see several adapters shortly that will allow you to use the Miracast functionality to \"throw\" your Kindle screen on to your TV so that you can use the TV to watch movies that are running on your Kindle.  Miracast has to take the place of the missing HDMI out port that was included in the last Kindle Fire tablet.  All in all, this tablet is a noticeable step up from the last generation.  It is a fully functional tablet, and with the \"side loading\" of applications from the Google Play store you can use this tablet for just about any Android application (although some games from Google Play must be connected to Google Play in order to function).By the way...I used the Mayday function to ask about a setting on the tablet.  I was very impressed by how quickly I was connected to a technical support agent, and how helpful the agent was in answering my question.  If you have any fear of using a tablet, the Mayday function is a welcome addition.  If you're buying the tablet for a technophobe, Mayday will be a great help to them if they have questions or problems.  This function is a quantum leap forward in customer service.

Plus, I wasn't convinced that I needed another electronic device since I have a laptop.  When Amazon pitched the no-interest offer over 5 payments, I reluctantly ordered the Kindle.

I can not believe how good even the speakers are given the size of this device. In contrast, watching the exact same program/movie on Netflix with my iPad - I need head phones unless it's perfectly quiet in the room. With the Kindle HDX whatever I've watched so far, I haven't needed headphones/ear buds.I am also still totally flumuxed by the people who whine and complain about the blue screen edge thing. Seriously, maybe it's like migraine sufferers who see a certain blinking light that affects them because I have absolutely no problem with this \"blue edge\" and never would have even noticed it had not people here complained. You have to really, really look, I have to put my face almost on the screen - take off my glasses - and then I see a very, very faint maybe 1 milimeter sized super light blue rim. I don't get the fuss.The screen is absolutely amazing - it is now my go-to tablet - I carry it around with me all day long in the house or whereever I go. I am currently at my condo in Florida and I can't think of another tablet or device that allows you to read in the Florida sun! If I'm in direct sunlight I just change the background to black and the letters pop.I can't say enough positive things about this device. Below is my earlier review.First let me say I had a Kindle HD prior to this and was hesitant to upgrade because of the reviews specifically about the \"blue hue\" people found while reading (what I have, up to this point, primarily used my Kindle for). Either the Kindle HDX 7 inch 32 Gig, no special offers, WiFi has this problem fixed, or those who complained have some sort of odd sensitivity to blue light. I'm writing this review April 2014 having used my new Kindle HDX for almost a week now and I see barely anything noticeable with regard to this blue hue reading with a white or sepia screen. I see zero blue hue with a black screen as well. I even showed my grown daughter the \"offending\" screen (saying nothing of the complaints) asking her if she saw anything, anything at all unusual or bothersome about the reading screen. She said, \"All I see is a page.\" Exactly. That's all I see too. The screen for all other uses is crystal clear, amazingly sharp and one of the reasons I decided to upgrade is because even with an i-BLASON case:  http://www.amazon.com/i-BLASON-Leather-Automatically-Compatible-Warranty/dp/B00EA1PMBW/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid;=1397744874&sr;=8-2&keywords;=iblason+case+Kindle+HDX+7+inch  the difference in weight between the HD and HDX is very noticeable. I'm 56 and have arthritic hands and the HDX in the case feels feather-light to me. I can read for hours with little discomfort. Also the light weight is important for me when traveling. I was one of the first to buy a Kindle back when Amazon first introduced these devices. During take-off of a flight - I used to read without a problem because no one knew what it was. Then the airlines went to the \"shut off all electronic devices\" to \"now you may leave your electronic devices on during take-off\" recently. So I have had over a 1/2 dozen Kindles and given over another 1/2 dozen as gifts. This Kindle is the best one so far.I also noticed negative reviews about battery life. I can only use my experience - not sure what the others are using their Kindle for - but I played three back-to-back games of Monopoly - read for twenty minutes, went on-line to check a few things for about another twenty and the battery was at 23%. If you've ever played Monopoly - the games take forever (some games can take at least a few hours), with many animations during each game. I do not find that type of batter drain a problem. I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 and the battery drain on that device is much faster than the Kindle Fire HDX. I can only read for an hour or two - do nothing else on the Samsung no less play any games with high graphics and the battery would be at the same level . Compared to the iPad 3rd generation which I also own, I think the battery life of the new Kindle HDX is as good if not better.Amazon had their special offer for Prime Time users so I thought I'd give it a try despite the nay-sayers and I'm absolutely satisfied with my purchase and haven't put it down since registering my new device. It is now my new, go-to tablet with the Galaxy taking a back seat to both the Kindle (in 1st place) and iPad.

Now the reason I wanted the smaller screen was because when I read my books I want to really feel like im reading a book sized object which is a better fit for me and makes a difference in my reading. This dissapointed me alot because I spend alot of extra money to pay for the 32 GB to take pictures on it but I cant really take any pictures of use with the front facing camera. The rear facing camera would make my 32BG purchase choice more useful. SO that was extremely dissapointing.  #2 when playing games on my kindle about 50% of the time the game will start flashing slightly but enough to really annoy me and make me think that something might be wrong with my device. But when calling mayday I was basically told to just call them back if it happens again but in reality it doesnt matter because of course you would have to catch it at the right time in order to show the may day people what you're talking about. The flashing that happens during the game is a random act and not something that can really be shown unless catching it at the right time which is unlikely.other than those two things, I really love my kindle as I do amazon but the two issues stated above really bug me since I really support amazon and have probably influenced 7 people at this point to buy Kindles as well as the prime membership within the past few years and probably only felt maybe 80% satisfaction from my current kindle.", "Date": "April 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "It's hard for me to get the hang of some of the basic functions.

Honestly I would rather view most pictures and videos on my Kindle than my computer or even my TV (well, the TV does have size going for it).  Performance is very quick and smooth most of the time. Silk (the browser) can stumble from time to time but gets going again quickly. No issues with games hanging (and they look beautiful). Wi-fi is good - nothing great but pretty reliable and good range. Battery life is solid. It doesn't last all day with heavy use, but it will keep you entertained for a while. I get 5-6 hours of pretty constant use before I start thinking I need to find the charger (drop below 30% and better safe than sorry).

The ability to add your own words to the dictionary is incredibly useful for customizing your Kindle Fire to be adapted to your personal way of thought and speech. If you are a member of Amazon Prime the Kindle Fire is a one stop experience for shopping, books, games, and video. The real problem is in the limited OS that Amazon has created to push its app store.  This could cause problems for people who are, like myself, used to the full access of the Google Play store which you cannot use. This also means that apps that are free on Google Play might cost you money on the Amazon store. This tablet also doesn't have flash along with all modern Android and Apple products. Flash is available on Windows tablets if that is something you need. Gaming seems to work well except for some second screen features, like Battlefield's Commander app, on my Xbox One. Second screen does allow me to use the Kindle Fire as a keyboard and mouse for the Xbox One which makes surfing the web and navigating menus much easier.

I was also surprised how many language apps there were, I downloaded some great ones for Korean and Spanish.

I KNOW there is better batteries Amazon could use, but I supposed you want us to just buy another Kindle when our current one dies.  As you're surfing the web or playing a game you can see the percentage of battery life constantly being drained; in 20 minutes it's drained 10% or more.  Have to charge it almost every day.  I don't expect this one to last as long as my first one.  Also, when I want a book to read, I scan the titles and click on the ones that look interesting to me, but when I go back to the previous page of the list of books, it doesn't take me back to where I was and I have to start scrolling through them again starting at the first one.  I miss being able to click on the top of the screen to get to settings.  Regarding email, several times now I've forwarded an email and it comes to ME from ME instead of the person I forwarded it to, and the original one I forwarded from has disappeared.

So far I can use my Kindle for two full days and not have my battery run down. The only downside to purchasing this Kindle is the fact that I had to pay $14.95 for the Microsoft Office feature. In reference to another persons comment on here I would like to verify the truth when it comes to Microsoft Office you do need the Internet in order to download the app but you do not need it to type or use most of the basic features.

This tablet compares favorably to both, but is primarily useful if you are a significant consumer of Amazon products, and particularly if you are an Amazon prime member.\\In terms of design, it is a small, light unit.  It is not quite as thin in the hand as the Nexus 7 (2013) is, but it nevertheless feels very slim and light.  The shape of the device is less oblong than the Nexus, and seems more designed to approximate the Kindle size for book and other text reading, while flipping it to landscape mode provides a more than satisfactory width for movies and other videos.  The speakers are located in the top, when in landscape mode, which is somewhat different from many other tablets, and adds to the usefulness of the tablet for watching videos.  The screen is bright and the high resolution is basically the same as that of the Nexus (less than the iPad Air, but that has a bigger screen).The operating system is based on Android but is essentially Amazon's modified version of it.  It is very fast and responsive, and everything is easily accessible with responsive swipes.  Unlike other Android-based tablets, however, you do not have access (directly) to Google Play.  This is because the Kindle is a device that is designed to be used primarily with Amazon-provided content.  If you are a big user of Amazon, and especially a Prime member (and therefore have access to the free prime movies and book lending and so on), this is ideal.  If, however, you are tied heavily into one of the other ecosystems (Apple or Google), then you may find yourself frustrated in terms of having your content (e.g., music) tied to another system.  Note that if you have that music downloaded to a computer, you can upload it into Amazon's cloud and listen to it through the Kindle as well, but that's a few extra steps you may not need to deal with if using a different tablet.The bottom line for me when comparing this tablet to others is that the potential buyer needs to understand (1) what am I going to be looking to use a tablet for and (2) what ecosystem am I tied into already, and to what extent?In my opinion, tablets aren't great for productivity as compared with laptops, but if you are looking for a productivity tablet you're likely best served with something like a Galaxy Note 10 or a Surface.  If, like most people, you use tablets mainly to consume media -- either movies or websites or books/magazines, etc., then it really comes down to what content provider you are most tied in with, because there are limits in terms of being able to access the content of the other providers from each device to some degree.  This applies in particular to people with significant music libraries that may be tied to iTunes at this point (music seems to be where many people stockpile more media than movies which tend to be rented).  Similarly, if you are heavily tied into Google's services (not just Google Play, but the rest of them as well), the Nexus may be more appealing because it directly links into all of them seamlessly.  However, if you are an Amazon content person, and especially an Amazon Prime member, this Kindle is a great device because it similarly links into the Amazon system seamlessly, and is a joy to use with prime movies, books and similar types of content.From my personal perspective, I find this my go-to tablet for content consumption at this point.  I am also tied into the Google ecosystem, but I mostly use my Android phone (or laptop) to interface with that, and view this device as my primary interface with my Amazon content.", "Date": "March 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very nice", "Author": "love this game,very addicting", "ReviewID": "R3PC9ALVKW82HQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought one for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it.

Some of these devices I use as Amazon intended; others are modified to suit specific needs/interests. From a hardware perspective the HDX is outstanding and an attractive alternative to the Nexus 7 if you don't need GPS, NFC or wireless charging. On smaller tablets I prefer the Kindle form factor as I find it easer to hold in any orientation without worrying about accidental screen touches/activations. When purchased I assumed root access and perhaps an alternative ROM would eventually be needed. Turns out a different launcher (Apex or Nova) and a few side loaded apps from 1Mobile were all that was required. Didn't even need to root my HDX which technically voids Amazon's warranty. The \"Mojito\" operating environment is more flexible than earlier Amazon/Fire ROMs; most Android apps run perfectly with exception to the Play store (admittedly a biggie) and some Google creations. I can live without those. And I still have easy access to Prime movies and a few native Amazon apps that I happen to prefer.

My bank app isn't available (capital one).  No YouTube app. No podcast player app. My favorite game app doesn't make them for the kindle. No decent weather apps are available. Second, you are stuck with the kindle browser, Silk. No chrome, Firefox, atomic, or safari. Silk is an ok browser but it doesn't handle embedded video very well. Lots of freezing and unexpected hangs. Bookmarks are awkward. Third, the touch screen is glitchier than my iPad. The cursor jumps around randomly. Good luck getting the cursor to go where you want it to when typing. Fourth, it's not easy to switch between apps. The OS stores everything in memory and the performance suffers if you use too many apps, and there's no way to close the ones you aren't using. I found myself shutting it down and restarting frequently. Fifth, a big selling point was the \"one free rental book a month\" deal with the kindle. But the selection is SMALL and it's impossible to search the lending library. Amazon sells the \"lending library\" hard, but it's clear it's not ready for primetime. Finally, some of my favorite websites are slow and glitchy with the silk browser (like slate).

My major issues with this kindle are ...The battery  takes so long to charge, dies extremely fast, and even when plugged in does not charge while in use. My previous kindle charged quickly even in use and had an amazing battery life!  I even called customer service and they said there's was a problem with it. Guess what? When I was sent the new one it worked just as bad as before.My next issue is What happened to flash player?!  My old kindle has it! And now when I go to watch certain shows I used to watch or when I go to amazon to view a product video I can't view it anymore!!Next ..  i used to watch the network apps such as the cw ect..  on my previous tablet and still do with no problems. but when i watch them on my HDX they time out whenever the commercial break happens, I have to actually exit the app ,go into my wifi , turn it off, and then back on again to get it to work! Once back in i have to fast foward to where i left off ! This is something i also asked about when in called customer service and was told it was the kindle and my internet. if this were true then why does it work perfectly on the old kindle? Again got the new HDX replaced and still have same issue to this day. It's not my Internet !  I've even been to places that only use one device in there home and have way better internet than me and my kindle still does this ! It was a huge disappointment!In my opinion they took more away and only added a camera.  If they keep this up I don't think I'll be buying anymore kindles in the future.

The reason I only gave it  4 stars is some of the features that come with it don't work as they should. The first one that comes to mind is the speech to text. It works very sporadic. One in three times it will work. What I do like is when it does work it's pretty accurate as far as words. I guess I am somewhat disappointed because we have an IPad and there is no comparison between the two. (In my opinion anyway) the iPad is a lot easier to navigate around on, speech to text always works as well. The touch sceen on the iPad also works a lot smoother and is more accurate. They say the android system is getting the bugs worked out and works as well as Apple.  I have to disagree, because of having both I can do side by side comparisons, and everything I have tried the winner is clearly Apple. If you can afford it the iPad is two times the machine.

Weigel \"Donna Weigel\"", "ReviewID": "R3GNMV4OBSOTS0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had a kindle before the Kindle fire ( and I waited for the HD version) that I loved but was becoming limited since I also wanted to convenience of checking email and going on the internet, following links in a ebook etc.  I was so in love with my regular kindle and was a reading fool on that thing. I had a relationship with it. Let\u2019s face it, I slept with it more than I have any man. Lol.  Giving it up and moving on was not an easy decision.Kindle vs Kindle Fire HD vs Fire HDX.Kindle:  Love the light shining on the book rather back lit.  It is far less stressful reading.  The gray background allowed me to read forever easily.  I loved how easy it was to organize books. However, it had become limited.  I couldn\u2019t really surf the internet, magazines and pictures wouldn\u2019t work on it well and it was black and white.  Pretty sure you know the rest.Kindle Fire:  I don\u2019t by the first of anything because it will improve and become cheaper.  The biggest issue with the kindle fire was it didn\u2019t have a reader and I do use that often.  The front page was a bookshelf which is ok but couldn\u2019t organize like the reg kindle.Kindle Fire HD:  I hate the carousel on kindle fire HD.  It\u2019s a circle of icons in which the last thing you opened goes up there.  Want it or not.  You can delete from the carousel but something else will pop up there that is on your device. It has a set number of icons it wants there and it will keep it filled.  Grrr.  I wish it would just go away.  I liked how I could organize my books on the regular kindle.  That said, there are apps that make that happen so it makes life easier. You know there HAS to be an app for that!  Over all the organization isn\u2019t bad. It\u2019s simple to use.  My six year old can use it no problem. But then again, kids are born knowing these things today.  Being back lit vs light shining on the book isn\u2019t as easy to read as the original kindle was.  The back light can be adjusted way down which is a plus. I don\u2019t think this is a big issue to most people.  I\u2019m dyslexic and having dimmer light on the gray background rocked!  I could be a reading fool.  I can\u2019t read as long on this.  As I said though for most people that probably isn\u2019t an issue.  After my withdraw from my original kindle I love this one.  SO much more you can do with it!!  The battery doesn\u2019t last like the original but we are doing WAY more with this one than just read.  AND naturally there is an app for that!!!  There are battery savers that shut down what isn\u2019t needed and does make a difference in battery life.  Considering with I do however I think the battery isn\u2019t bad. I play music and a game at the same time or music and read, music and read.  I am asking a lot! I was use to the other battery lasting for weeks.  One plus is my phone charger works for the kindle.  I\u2019m just overall too happy with the upgrade to Kindle Fire HD.HD vs HDX.I got the HD with Ads because I didn\u2019t care to pay to not have them. I\u2019m really glad I did that.  I like the ads.  There were some movie and TV trailers that I would have otherwise missed.  Product ads you never know but they aren't annoying at all.My son bought the HDX.  He loves it.As far as I can tell the big difference is with the HDX you can have Wifi and cell towers.  Oh and the live help.  I asked if I could upgrade because it came out right after I bought my HD. The answer was no, I would need to sell it myself.  I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t need to use cell towers.  Some might where they live but I don\u2019t.  As for live help, once you learn your kindle do you really need that?  I didn\u2019t for the price difference.  Last I knew it was a good $200 difference.  I\u2019m sure the price will go down, the HD will be priced at peanuts and it will all balance out in time.  It seems about a year is when the big price change happens.Good luck with your new decisions!", "Date": "January 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "I had a Kindle Fire before", "Author": "Katgirl2", "ReviewID": "R3KM077T57GA51", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I used my Kindle Fire for 2 years before getting my Kindle Fire HDX.

I play several every day such as crossword and Scrabble on my old Kindle.  The choice of games on Fire are mostly juvenile ones with sound effects which are irritating and most of them will only let you play a game or two without paying the company who created them more money.

I do like that I can pick up my email without starting up the computer. I can check it while I'm sitting around watching TV, etc.  However, you can't trash the email on your computer from your Fire, so you end up trashing it from the Kindle, then when you get into your computer, the emails are still there and you have to go through the process again..  I also don't like the front only camera.  It's very hard to take a decent picture with it because you can't see what you're focusing on.  Perhaps going up to the next level would have been better, but that was a great deal more expensive.  I'd say this is an okay device if you like to play the games a lot, don't use the dictionary very much, either don't read a lot of books or have young eyes.  But if you have an old Kindle you like for reading, word games , the dictionary and thesauras, stick with the black and white.", "Date": "January 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "I do like it!!", "Author": "Wayne Draper", "ReviewID": "R2TU56XPA9114J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Like the display.

I didn't need a high end laptop or a desktop with an i7 processor or any kind of powerhouse. I just needed something with good processing power, an HD display, and something simple so that my mother could browse the web and watch Netflix or something. The product came with the standard usb/wall charger and nothing more, but you don't need anything else. After registering the device it was good to go. The quality is superb, transitioning between apps and things are easy and fluid, and it even has a headphone jack so you can hear media in peace or without disturbing others. The only thing my mother wanted, though, was to play Papa Pear Saga and it isn't compatible with the Kindle Fire.All in all this product was more than enough for my mother. She was happy with the product and I was happy to see my mother happy. The only thing I didn't like, which has nothing to do with the product itself, was that Amazon had the May-Day $30 off Kindle's sale right after I ordered it so I kinda missed out on a greater deal.

The color screen is crisp and, as a color screen, is more suitable for technical volumes than the B&W; Kindles. The is some glare in bright light but that is the trade-off for color.The included apps are good enough. I appreciate being able to jump to a browser to research something I encounter in book I am reading. The Silk browser is much improved over previous instances. The mail app is also good enough for casual use.I don't watch videos on the Kindle so I can't comment on the performance at that task. I have watched some video tutorials using the browser and that worked well.In all, if you accept that the Kindle is a media consumption device with hooks into and dependencies upon the Amazon ecosystem and if that is why you bought it you will be very happy.

I had not tried connecting in other environments other than in my home where I have high sped internet through a cable company. Thus, I ran into the very same connectivity issues that I had with my old Kindle. This was very disappointing as I had been reassured by the Amazon chat tech that the connectivity problems had been significantly improved (in the HDX 7'). For this reason, I made the decision not to order the 4G internet (Verizon) with it and ordered solely the WIFI connection for it. I am returning the device in the morning.

So far I've had a pretty experience with it. Adding this to a mainly iOS collection was a bit of a struggle at first (still is a bit), with regards to navigating the software and remembering where the buttons on the machine are. Those are obvious initial speed bumps though, and they haven't been that bad. I've been very happy with the sharpness of the screen. Very happy. Movies look great, games look great, photos and games look great. I've burned through three books on this thing and it's been great. The Send To Kindle app is such a neat thing, I've been able to send documents straight from my Mac to the Kindle over wifi, which is so simple and genius. The only thing I haven't figured out quite yet is if the battery always drains as fast, or if there are apps running the background and I'm just not sure how to turn them off completely. It's a simple thing to do on my iPad Mini. Between the Mini and the Kindle I prefer the interface of the Mini, but the size and screen of the Kindle. The Kindle is definitely my go-to for reading now, and the Mini will remain my game/entertainment machine, mostly because the app store is leaps and bounds ahead of anything else. I definitely recommend this to someone who's in the market and doesn't have a tablet of any kind, but I'm unsure if I'd recommend it to someone who already does have one.", "Date": "January 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "My third Kindle and I love it too.", "Author": "So.Calif.Grandma", "ReviewID": "R25HCDLTINVZIU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I use this Kindle as an alternate computer.

Edit2: We have used the mayday button on our kindle twice in order to get a bit of assistance learning the navigation at first, then to get assistance when it froze up one time. Customer service is incredible for many reasons.  First, because the person helping you gets connected immediately, no time waiting on the phone, second they are instantly remoted in and can see and help you live on your screen, third, they offered to replace the kindle at the drop of a hat if it freezes up.  We decided to update the device and keep some background apps closed and see how it goes.  It is a big relief that Amazon is very concerned at keeping us happy with this product.

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE my new Kindle!!", "Date": "January 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best Kindle Fire Hands Down", "Author": "David Cripe", "ReviewID": "R1NWRE8PDA313L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this Kindle Fire HDX during the cyber-Monday special of $179, which was totally worth it as that price.  My family has owned the original Kindle Fire the past two years roughly, and this one is way above that version.  Is it better than the Kindle Fire HD version?  Depends, but probably not if price is your biggest factor.Pros:1) iPad Contender - Seriously.  The iPad in my opinion is way overpriced for what it does.  The Kindle Fire HDX is just as capable at handling most of the same work flow with a couple of differences.  Yes, this is tied to the Amazon App store.  If Google Play was standard, then Apple might be worried.  Right now though, Amazon is crippling their own success.2) Fluid Performance - Smooth as butter.  I have played around with everything available for the past two months and it handles it all with excellence.  Games, work, reading, etc run flawlessly (app issues not withstanding).3) Screen - Sharpest resolution I have ever seen on a screen this size.  Made the original Kindle Fire look like a 10 year old non-HD television.  I could stare at this thing for days (but won't).  Reading, movies, games, etc are shown in perfect HD resolution.NOTE - The blue pixel edge issue is there, but it is not distracting to me.  I actually kind of like it.  If you read a lot on white backgrounds, then it pops out more than normal.  The haze falls to the background after I begin reading the first page of something, and I never notice it much any more.4) Micro USB Connector - Bite it Apple!  :)  No cord carousal here.  If you have a cord sitting around, it most likely works for charging or connecting the Kindle Fire HDX.  For the first time ever - a plug adapter is included!  Amazon is including a plug adapter so you can actually charge the device through a regular electrical outlet.  What a concept Amazon!  That might catch on with other electronics (sarcasm).5) Bells and Whistles - This thing has it all (mostly).  Dual-band WiFi, HD screen, Amazon support (best in the world), light as a feather, etc, etc.Cons:1) Amazon App Store (sort of) - No Google Play?  I know Amazon wants everyone to use the device for their content, but not allowing one of the largest app stores on your Android device seems illogical.  I am able to use 3rd-party app stores to upload missing apps and outdated ones on the Amazon App Store, but still!2) USB Connection Port - The connection port on the device can be a bit of a nuisance.  You have to connect it at an angle on the device (around 30 degrees).  Just irritating to me for some reason as everything else has it straight, so your mileage may vary.3) Mayday Button Gimmick - I am a computer-savvy person.  I don't need help on where to press the power button or tweak the brightness.  If you are buying this for grandma or a person that never has used much technology in the past 10 years, then this is a life saver for you (no more annoying phone calls).4) Battery - I get a couple days of heavy usage (8 hours) out of it.  I just wish I could get the Kindle reader battery life of 4 to 8 weeks.  :)Overall:This is finally the Kindle to put Amazon in striking range of Apple on the tablet front.  If you crave everything Amazon like me, then it is a no brainer to purchase this.  If you are not, then buy it anyway as you will save at least $100 over the nearest priced iPad.  If Amazon would just switch to Google Play for the app store, then there is nothing that would stop them from ruling the world!  :)", "Date": "January 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire HDX 7\"", "Author": "Melissa", "ReviewID": "R22FZPHTPJ6OYK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "New owned a Kindle or a Tablet and got this for Christmas and I love it!

I tried with all my power to like the Kindle. But in the end, I will be returning this device. The hardware is excellent, and the user interface is pretty good as well. But odd behavior kept occurring. The device once went into a boot loop while I was at work without a charger. It continuously rebooted all day long. Nothing I did would stop the boot loop. Finally when I got home and plugged it into the charger, it booted back to the UI. I also have been noticing the screen flicker at times. It's more of an annoyance than a problem. There are other odd things that I can't recall at the moment. But ultimately, it's the battery life that prompts me to return the Kindle. Fully charged at 100% and left over night will find the device down to 88% without use. Then, when I pick the device up and actually use it, the battery is down to needing another charge within 1 or 2 (maybe 3) hours. Not heavy usage either, playing Candy Crush then browsing Facebook will do it. One time, I plugged the Kindle into charge before leaving for work, only to come home eight hours later and find that the screen was still on, and the device hadn't gone up 1% in battery charge. Another time, I plugged the device in for the night at 68%, went to bed and woke up to find the device charged only to 77%. Meanwhile, my Nexus 7 was at 14%, plugged in at the same time and was at 100% the next morning. I just can't have a device that I am constantly worried about keeping charged all the time. So, in the end, this device has been boxed back up and will be going back to Amazon.

Which really impressed me! They pushed out some updates to me, gave me pointers on how to ensure I am on the tablet version of common websites (since videos won't work on all of the regular sites), and ABC published an updated app for viewing episodes. Now I am largely happy with the Kindle's ability to watch streaming videos. The only downsides I have experienced is the Hulu is not available (you can access hulu plus but not the free site), the volume/sound projection abilities don't seem as good as some of my other devices (like my ipod), and you can only have one window/tab open at a time. So for instance if I want to check the news during a commercial you can't do it- which is a downside for me since I am a multi-tasker.

I haven't owned a tablet before but I've played around on other's iPads. I feel like this tablet is very comparable to an iPad but at almost half the cost, I would pick the Kindle every time. I chose the 7\" instead of the 8.9\" because I like the smaller tablet and I personally would never hold up something so big to take a picture, especially when I have my phone or digital camera.Cons:- There is a blue/purple haze around the border of the screen that is visible on white. It actually doesn't bother me at all but it does bother some people. I don't even notice it's there unless I specifically pay attention to it. Even though it doesn't bother me, I would rather it not be there.- Battery life isn't great compared to the iPad. For the same amount of use, I'm used to charging every 2 weeks or so instead of every 3-4 days.- I don't like that the charger is plugged in at an angle instead of straight on. It's not really THAT big of an issue but it does take more effort than usual to plug it in.- This is more my fault for not reading/understanding the Prime benefits, but you only get the benefits of Prime if your account pays for it, not when you get added and another account pays for it (which completely makes sense). I was really looking forward to \"borrowing\" Kindle books for free and downloading movies to watch later offline but my husband wanted to keep paying for prime on his account and I didn't want to put my Kindle under his account or have both of us pay for Prime.Overall, I love my Kindle and it's a great tablet for the price.

I understand that the registration process is intuitive for most generations BUT a simple fact sheet with a tech support phone number would have been very helpful.

Also if i want to install google apps it is possible. Seriously Amazon Prime is just the way to go for all your shopping needs. So ..it has a fast enough processor to game and complete tasks like surf or watch a movie. Oh yeah another big thing was....reading books...this thing makes it easy to read a book....Amazon Prime and this device just works and is a huge solution for many tasks just reach down and pick it up...only thing that I would like to see is Kindles offer more harddrive space....like a 1tb...yeah we are in a time of file servers aka cloud servers...but in times of no internet...a real harddrive is a must...face it 4G/3G is a hoax, its a joke when it comes to internet so don't fall for the 4G lie and highway robbery mobile internet companies charge for internet...Amazon seriously this product and your growing services is on the right track for the future. Just remember don't close off this device to just Amazon...that would be the end of Kindle. I wish I had the money to have several of these devices....sometimes i don't need the full pc desktop but have a certain need and this device makes it possible and does so smoothly very good device very good tool. Keep up the good work Amazon! Amazon has so much potential that could grow alot of business and create alot of jobs....Kindle HDX is worth having! And my boy loves it! I recommend this especially if you are a Amazon user. I used this product for 20+ days or so and I'm getting one for Christmas. Battery life could be better but so could the ram and harddrive...but for what I did the device was not a problem it actually was the solution for many many tasks.  I watched movies, streamed music, watched video, surfed, read articles and books, used the alarm and calender, used yahoo weather app, played games. The only thing i noticed as something it lacked was harddrive space when the Amazon prime video offered to download the movie better quality would require more harddrive space. But this is more of need when traveling through an area where there would be no internet or limited internet. And... Really... the only thing...lacking is my bank roll to buy constantly 24/7 on Amazon with this device..haha...I'm sure i could come up with negatives but this device really is a solution a tool that just works for me.", "Date": "December 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Finally, Amazon got this mostly right!", "Author": "A.

But it's a great E reader.I wanted a good 7 inch tablet.  I bought a returned the Google Nexus 7.  It was great except for no browser having a reading pane which is important in a small tablet.  You would think Google would have this in Chrome but no.  The screen is the best in class.I went to Best Buy and they had the HD and HDX side by side.  I compared the internet and there was no comparison - they HDX was very fast so I bought it to try out.  Happy to report that this is now a true tablet in that the Silk browser is much improved,, the quad core makes all the difference, the internet is now very usable and fast.HDX also has improvements over the HD - you can slide up from the bottom to access recently used programs which is very important if you need to switch between apps since only Surface allows you to keep two apps open simultaneously in the tablet world.  This works better than iPad.A page from other androids - you swipe down to see email and other notifications.The power button is now accessible!Size is smaller and slimmer.Some have noticed that there is a purple haze to the background.  That's true and that's something you have to judge for yourself if it bothers you.There is a limit on the number of tabs you can open on the Silk browser.Battery life is improved over HD.  It now comes with a cable and wall charger.There is no rear camera.  If that's important to you, consider the iPad Mini.  OR you can buy a real camera for the price difference.In summary, there is really no reason to buy the HD unless the price is $100.  The HDX is now a good competitive tablet.  The app store remains a problem if you depend on apps for games.  I have found some surprisingly good specialty apps.This is smaller than the iPad Mini and almost half the price.  Unless you are trapped in the Apple ecosystem and need their apps, (there isn't much you can't get from the web sites) this is a good alternative.", "Date": "December 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "ABSOLUTELY fantastic", "Author": "Kindle Customer", "ReviewID": "R15I3PHL630MFY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wish I had WiFi in my home, so I can enjoy it even more.

Since this tablet cannot yet be purchased in The Netherlands in a store, this was the only chance for me to pick it up and feel and explore it. I loved the design, the feel, the incredible clarity and mega-fast processor.Back home, I tested a lot of tablets at a Dutch local megastore. Google Nexus seemed appealing, then Samsung tab 3.0, but I disliked the shapes, too long/narrow screen proportions. LG Gpad 8.3 was another temptation, but again: that weird long narrow screen? I jumped on to Apple's Ipad Mini 2. Bigger screen than the average 7\" and just perfectly proportioned. Simply not being an Apple's type of guy, I hesitated. What held me back at Ipad Mini 2, were the limitations of dropping audio and video files on it. You would have to use Itunes for almost everything and convert many movie files.With Kindle, I wasn't sure about its Amazon-tunnel-vision strategy. But I also read there were a lot of ways to sideload apps outside the Amazon app-convent.From the day I received it (3 days after purchase, this gets UPS delivered to your doorstep and yes, they do ask your neighbours to receive it on your behalf in case you're not at home), I have not regretted this purchase for one second.I like Amazon products a lot. I do read Kindle books. But I like Kobo also. No problem, on youtube there's a perfectly clear instruction video on how to bring Kobo to your Kindle, and the two do peacefully co-exist.Magazines: lovely, cheap and easy to order, a delight to page through on this tablet.PDF files, Word documents: perfect viewing.For more extensive typing, I purchased the Perixx Periboard-805L, which works like a charm as a bluetooth wireless foldable keyboard for my Kindle tablet.Kindle Fire HDX 7 had my first attention, and remained my ultimate choice.

And when I say froze, i mean it became completely non-responsive for over an hour until i finally gave up and performed a hard reboot. All 3 times I was using the music player, which should be the easiest, most straightforward operation!

I'm coming from an Apple ecosystem. I have Apple everything. This is my first non Apple purchase. I really love the iPad but the market has changes since I bought the original version. There are way more options. The Kindle was a fraction of the cost of the ne iPad mini retina. The screen is gorgeous. I find it the perfect size for watching movies in the hand. Amazon makes it very easy to move your music over to the Amazon ecosystem from Apple if you want to do that. For 20ish bucks a year you can move all your apple music to the cloud at Amazon. From there you can download whatever songs you want to your Kindle or just play them from the cloud. Very easy.I was initially worried about not having access to the full Android spectrum of apps. It hasn't proven to be an issue at all. It took me about 10 minutes to sidestep the Amazon store and install Chrome and Firefox. I was also able to install a flash player and can now run any flash web apps through the Dolphin web browser. I couldn't do this on my iPad.The touchscreen is very snappy with no lag at all. This processor is speedy.A big upgrade from my iPad 1. The built in speakers are also better than my iPad 1. I didn't know if I would be OK with the smaller screen bit I'm enjoying it quite a bit. The more convenient size has be taking the kindle with me more than I ever did with the iPad. The iPad was really just too big to lug around. The kindle slips into my coat pocket easy.The special offers on the home screen don't bother me at all. Once you swipe to unlock the Kindle they go away and don't bother you at all.Mayday is awesome! I had a question just today that I couldn't find the answer to so I tried it. Within 15 seconds I had a technician on my screen helping me out.

But before I get to what drags the score down for me, the good stuff about the Kindle Fire HDX:- Clearly more than a reader.  The hardware in this is powerful and easily high up comparative to other tablet-like device of this size.- Battery life is great so far.- Fantastic screen quality; reading, browsing the internet, using apps like netflix, tumblr, etc., all look fantastic- Sound is also very good, headphones and speakers both- Ads are very unobtrusive (if applicable to your kindle), only appearing on the unlock screen.- Like advertised, works straight out of the box (obviously if you have linked a previously existing amazon account to the kindle)- Big name apps from the amazon store work perfectly. Netflix, Tumblr, Pintrest, Pandora, Skype, Steam, Sonos, BBC, NPR, Twitch are some that I had no trouble quickly installing and using. The email integration is great, and the goodreads integration is absolutely fantastic.- Most of the settings and features are very intuitive, and when using for the first time there will typically be very basic, quick tutorials.- A great deal for the price.- If you own Amazon content in their cloud its a matter of seconds to access it. And if you have Prime, the kindle is a no-brainer.All in all a great device. However there are a number of limiting factors and mild annoyances that build up to a loss of a star for me. The good news is that many of these can be fixed; the question is whether they might actually be fixed. Here's my problems with the device:- Apps are solely from the Amazon Kindle App store. This is useful in some ways, as you can control apps from your amazon account remotely, but also limiting in others. Compared to the Google Play store the selection is lacking. Although it should be mentioned that this may be partially be design, since there are many apps that do not work (yet) on this kindle's version of android.  Even so, apps can be side-loaded onto the device if you have basic technical know-how. For example, the Humble Bundle App works perfectly on my kindle. To be fair a lot of apps are pretty much crap, but I'd like to have the options for more, albeit mixed with some quality control.- App permissions can sometimes be downright creepy, i.e. a stupid game or simple app having access to data  that it clearly does not need to function and you would rather keep personal. I understand that this is not strictly Amazon's responsibility but rather that of the third-party developers and the owner of the kindle, but its worth mentioning here.- The placement of the only physical buttons, the power and volume buttons, isn't as intuitive as I would like. I find myself accidentally pressing the wrong ones from time to time. I suppose that I might just have to get used to them though.- I would've liked the option for a mircoSD slot, but I guess we live in the age of the ~cloud~. The 16 GB isn't really 16 GB, which is par for the course. But its even less than you might think, you only get 10.6 GB. Unless all your content is on or going to be on your amazon account, spring for the 32 or 64 GB model.- The 7\u201d version only has a camera facing you; no camera facing outwards.  Not really super important unless you want it.- The Carousel is plain stupid. This is a function that works well on other multi-touch devices, but on this kindle it just plain doesn't work well. The intended function is to quickly pick up what you had been doing previously, and for reading books this is still useful. However for everything else it isn't very. In particular if you load up things (like drm-free books via usb) they ALL appear as new on the Carousel, and you can only remove them one at a time. If there was someway to customize it, like so that everything new did not appear and you could lock in which apps you wanted to appear on it, then it might be functional, but as it is I ignore it completely unless I want to get back to the last book I was reading.- Some options for organizing books would be helpful rather than just sort by title/author/recent and displaying covers. An option for alphabetized letter sections would be nice, as well as some indication of a scroll bar to the right hand side.- One of the first things I did in my settings was turn off letting things automatically detect where I am located. I have wi-fi only, and I don't really need it on, plus nearly everything asks for it which just kind of creeps me out. But, and this is the most annoying thing, every single time an app or website requests it I get a pop-up asking me if I want to enable location-based services. Let me repeat this: Every. Single. Time. And a lot of apps will consistently ask. So at least once every 5-20 minutes, depending on what I'm using, I will be interrupted by this pop-up asking me this question even though the answer is pretty much always no. Which I thought was, you know, the point of me disabling it in the settings to begin with.

So my 3 year old son would hand me the tablet every time an ad came up so I could close it for him. This got pretty annoying! After a few days of using it, I just found myself not happy with it. I decide to reluctantly returned it. This device has so much promise. All it needs is a suitable app store. I guess I'm going to pay $200 more for and Ipad which I didn't want to do in the first place.

Also have a full-size iPad which is a great size for watching movies in bed, but really too big/heavy to play games.  The original Kindle Fire has only 8 GB storage (partly taken up by software) so I wanted another smaller tablet.  It was between the new Kindle HDX or the new iPad mini.  One thing I didn't like about the iPad mini (besides the price tag) is that the bezzle on the long sides is so narrow, it is hard to hold the device without getting your thumb on the display (which screws up games).  When I saw the HDX on sale on Cyber Monday, I grabbed it.It's fast, thin, light and easy to hold for long periods of time.  I can't believe how light it is compared to my KFire! There are several design changes, such as the ability to show the percentage the battery is charged in the little icon in the top right corner. You have to swipe down from the top of the display to access settings and other utilities.  I got the 32 GB version, so there is plenty of room for games and other apps.  I did download a Prime Instant Video to watch off-line, but I don't like the small display for watching movies.About that display -- I compared the HDX to the original Fire, looking at the same page of a book that has alot of white space on it.  White is a color, and like all colors, it can be \"warm\" or \"cool.\"  A cool white is \"bluish\", and a warm white will be a little yellowish.  When I compared the 2 kindle displays for a book, I was shocked to see something I never noticed before.  On the original Fire, the white is \"cool/bluish\" and there is yellowish tint seeping in around the edges of the pages of the book I was comparing!  This never bothered  me; as I said, I never noticed it.  On the new HDX, the opposite is true --  the color white is warm (yellowish) with the blue/purple (that so many have commented about) seeping in around the edges of the book.  I doubt that this will bother me, and I feel that the people who complained about this and sent back this beautiful little device because of it, need to get a life!  BTW, the page on the HDX doesn't look yellowish to me at all; it is only when compared side-by-side to the original Fire that you can detect the different tints to the white color.I love playing games on the HDX, as even fast running games (such as my favorite Temple Run 2) work without stalling.  And, I got Temple Run Oz (finally) which was not compatible with the original Fire.There are some design features I don't like, such as the way the charger sticks in at an angle.  But charging is very fast using the included charger. My only real issue now is the battery life.  I am currently charging it up, and I am going to see if I can get anything close to 10 hours of \"mixed use\" on it.  (Yes, there are ways to extend battery life, such as turning off wifi when not using it.  Search on the internet for other tips.)Edit about battery life:  I usually find that when products are advertised as \"up to X hours on a single battery charge (depending on settings, usage, blah blah blah)\"  I usually get half that. What concerned me about the HDX was that I had fallen asleep with the HDX unplugged, watching a PREVIOUSLY DOWNLOADED movie (a 2.5 hour movie downloaded in \"better\" quality; after it finished, the display went into sleep mode)-- the next morning, the battery was showing only 35% charged from fully charged the night before.  Since many people posting on the forums with battery problems were told to do a \"hard reboot\"  I tried that then fully charged the battery again (luckily, charging is pretty quick.)  Downloading music, and letting the display go to sleep mode, the HDX lost only about 10% per hour.  But as soon as I picked it up and played some games for a little while (like Temple Run 2) the battery much more rapidly depleted (this is with wifi turned on, as music was simultaneously downloading).  Then I recharged it, and again tested that same 2.5 hour previously downloaded movie -- with wifi turned off, \"airplane mode\" turned on, and brightness set at about 70%, the battery drained from fully charged to 65%. So, finally, I downloaded a 2 hour SD quality movie to my HDX, and going from fully charged, with wifi off, and brightness lowered to about 50%, the battery went to 88%, losing only 12%.  Yes, a big improvement over my original KFire which lost double that, 25%, under the same conditions.When I got my HDX it was about 70% charged.  Looking in the settings, I saw that the software was up-to-date.  I was able to download content, read, and play games, without the HDX turning itself off and rebooting (as many have complained of).  The next morning, I saw a notification that there had been a software update -- one thing that was changed is that you can now put apps and books into \"collections.\"  Not only that, but apparently my HDX \"synced\" wirelessly with my iPad Kindle reading app, where I had already put some books into collections.  Those same books now appear in collections on my HDX without my doing anything. Thank you Amazon.I give this 5 stars, certainly in comparison to the original Kindle Fire.  In general, this HDX is spectacular and the price is great.", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "bargain despite the blue", "Author": "Marcus L.

Brownie point #1SIZE: It is significantly lighter than my original fire,  and the tapered edges make it feel quite thin.  Not a fan of the tapered edges at this point,  seems slippery like I am going to drop it.  Might just be the way I hold it ..CHARGER:  I am not a fan of the charger port location;  due to the tapered edges ... the mini-USB plug goes in on a weird angle.  Can't just hold the thing flat and push it in ... I can see I will need to be very careful when plugging it in.SCREEN:  Turning on the HDX ... had a instant WOW factor.  The screen is so much better than my original fire it is almost ridiculous to compare the two.  Very crisp, clear picture and ...TOUCH RESPONSE:  I am sure it's due to the power behind it (CPU) that the responsiveness of the touch screen and smooth scrolling are also massive improvements over my original kindle.SETUP:  It took no time at all to setup;  it linked all my old books and apps automatically.  It was seemless .. my old kindle was still warm sitting beside me and I already had this one up and running with all my usual apps on it. Well done AmazonBROWSING SPEED:  One of the most improved aspects I notice is how fast the browsing of the web is.  This is something I used to not use on my original kindle ...

Over the next 4 years I purchased the Kindle Fire, the Kindle Fire HD, and now the Kindle Fire HDX (64Gb), all 7\" models.  Each Fire model has been a significant improvement over its predecessor, although of course none come remotely close to the battery life of the electronic ink models.  That being said, as a reader, battery life for all the Fire models is fine for those long airplane trips, where you have the bonus of the device playing music while you read.  Other reviewers have covered battery life for those willing to watch movies on such a small screen.  Being able to mirror movies from Amazon Prime onto my TV is good enough for my purposes.So what else is noticeably improved?  First off, the HDX is noticeably thinner, lighter, and faster.  Second, if your email requires VPN, there is an integrated VPN client that is almost trivial to set up (you may have to download the Thor OS upgrade for this, I did).  The provided email app connected easily for me. and I found new versions of apps I typically use, such as ES File Explorer and a really good (free) SSH terminal emulation app that works great on the HDX.I debated long and hard as to whether an upgrade from my HD was advisable at this time, and finally decided to take the plunge.  I'm glad I did.  The HDX is living up to the hype.  I even found the help feature useful.

The Kindle does have a touch to speech feature that is nice once the device is open, but when it is on, unlocking the device is significantly more difficult than it should be. Once you are reading an Kindle book, or listening to an audible book, there are some nice features, but getting to these features is not easy with low vision.

I have been a prime member since its inception\u2026and it is the first place I go to when I am looking to buy something.  I love Amazon\u2026probably in an unwholesome way.With that decision behind me I was now free to find a device to take entertainment with me when I travel for work.  Do you have any idea how long and painful it can be to copy DVDs into digital files to take along when traveling\u2026I simply did not have the patience to convert all 14 seasons Dallas!  I needed a device that would hold a number of videos to get me through at least 2 weeks overseas at a time.  Reliable streaming overseas is generally not an option for a variety of reasons.And so I bought a Kindle FireHDX (64MB, no ads) and have been absolutely delighted\u2026I seriously couldn\u2019t be happier.  It is so FAST\u2026compared to my android ASUS transformer tablet.  The video quality is beautiful.  The sound is great and it is extremely simple to download videos\u2026even Prime videos\u2026to take along on my travels.Of course, nothing is perfect.  There are some disappointments but they are relatively minor.1) Battery life is disappointing if wifi is not disabled.  That has been my experience.  I will lose 15 \u2013 20% overnight if I leave the wifi on.  With the wifi off\u2026battery life is very good.  If there is an option to turn off wifi after being asleep for a while\u2026I don\u2019t know about it yet.  Long term, hopefully something like this will be developed in a software update.2) Lack of a mini HDMI out.  I like to plug my device into the HDMI ports of hotel TVs and watch my shows from the bigger screen.  When I realized too late that it had no HDMI out, I bought a Tronsmart miracast device.  It will work but not as smoothly or easily as a simple cable would.  I think the miracast is not quite ready for prime time yet.  It is not the end of the world if I can\u2019t hook up the hotel TV.  Watching directly from the Kindle works well.3) Apps\u2026need more.  I once had a Blackberry Playbook.  What awesome tablet that was\u2026really.  Fine quality device, perfect in every way\u2026except for the limited number of apps.  Amazon has to make this a priority.

I wonder if the power button is gonna eventually wear out.", "Date": "March 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Happier Than a Child at Christmas!", "Author": "Moosie", "ReviewID": "R2HVQRY3MPRBZN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Oh My God!

I honestly think the iPad Mini Retina and the Fire HDX are in a performance class all of their own!DISPLAYThe screen is super sharp and has incredible contrast all around, color accuracy is very high but, the backlight does have a soft blue glow around the edges.Now a note from my Eye Doctor, Increased intake of blue light into our eyes has raised the percentage of people who have degenerative disorders with their eyes and they recommend Yellow Filtered Lenses to protect your eyes.  Research Macular Degeneration and Blue Light to see for yourself and keep in mind, this is not exclusive to the Fire HDX but, their decision to use Blue Lighting makes it worth mentioning (this has always been an issue but, mobile devices and increased use of computers make it a much larger issue).SOFTWAREThe interface of the software only has one feature that bugs the check out of me and that's the Carousel, everything else with the OS and apps actually works very well and I'm pretty impressed with what I'm seeing! Oh and Silk works great if you stop it from accelerating page loading because, it crashes often with that on.Mayday is also a pleasant surprise and I've used it a few times for some quick answers. It was way easier than googling the answers and even my Apple friends were really impressed with it.Another issue was that Amazon noted that you could now download Prime Videos to watch on the go but, they neglected to mention that it is only a small selection of movies that can be downloaded so you're forced to stream them and that creates larger issues with Battery Life (see the Battery Section).Not having a YouTube App underscores a larger issue with the Fire line...  The App Store is severely lacking and many apps don't run right on the new tablets (Dead Trigger is upside down) and side loading apps often leaves you with apps that either don't work or don't work correctly 100% of the time!  This is a real issue and you would think that Amazon would want to stress the importance of getting these apps to work right out of the box!The Interface also has support for posting to Facebook and Twitter but, no Google+ and I'm not sure why Amazon is so intent on being Anti Google with their devices.BATTERY LIFEBattery is decent for every day tasks like Facebook, web browsing, emailing, reading books, playing a few games, and watching an occasional video clip.However, streaming movies from Prime resulted in a Net Battery Life of 5 Hours and that's half what Amazon claimed!OVERALLNo YouTube and using a blue back light has left me rating the Fire as average and I honestly think Amazon might have made a mistake with this screens back lighting. Everything else about the tablet is spot on and well worth the money they charge for it.For the record, even though I consider it an average offering, it is the best deal for the money and sadly, the other offerings might actually be worse than the Fire (the Nexus 7 FHD certainly is far less stable as is the iOS 7 based iPad line).Okay, two more notes that happened to me today...1st, the Tablet randomly decided to reboot itself while I was reading an ebook and that's twice it has done this in the kindle App.2nd, While I was tethering the device just decided it was going to download a very large firmware update without telling me it was doing it and needless to say, before I realized it my monthly data allowance was done!  I guess the only consolation here is that it might have actually fixed the first issue!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update 11/25/13The latest patch from Amazon appears to have remedied the lockup issue and I'm very pleased with it.Since the locks were happening however, I purchased an iPad Mini Retina and honestly, I find the fire HDX to be more responsive and fluid overall and the display is noticeably more vibrant on the Fire HDX.", "Date": "October 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing", "Author": "Krista  Timm", "ReviewID": "R2ECGWOAO5WR6E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a first kindle fire they released and I loved it but now I love this one more.

In this day and age, a table ought to have a Micro SD memory card slot for expansion, and an HDMI connector - ESPECIALLY a media tablet like these!  The new HDX series has NEITHER.  The original Fire did not have a MicroSD slot either, and I was hoping Amazon would add one, but they did not.  Then they took away the HDMI port which I use often to play a movies on my TV.  They added wireless streaming (via Miracast) which my TV (new within the last 6 months) does not have.  Without that port, the HDX cannot stream to my TV and makes it nearly useless for me - certainly it will NOT be something a I spend $$ on.  Checking the accessory list, they don't even offer a wireless Miracast to HDMI receiver!  Talk about shooting themselves in the foot!
