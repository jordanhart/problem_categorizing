Oddly enough, it's so beautifully easy to use (my one year old daughter loves playing with it), it's almost doesn't feel like a computer at all.A word of warning - this review is written for people who've never owned an iPad before - and are wondering what all the fuss is about.  If you're thinking of upgrading skip down to the \"What's great about the Air\" section below, or just buy it - it's amazing.Just what's all the fuss about?--------------------------------------I used to own a laptop for work, and (very occasionally), it'd sit on my lap on the sofa, and I'd use it for pleasure (eMail, watching films or playing the odd game).  Then I bought my first iPad, and the laptop became redundant, a boring \"work device\".  Hard to explain, but the fact the iPad is so small and light, and you navigate around with your finger by pointing and gently swiping the screen makes the whole experience a lot easier - a lot more fun.Even my most \"Luddite\" of friends have been won over.It's incredibly simple and easy to use (it only has one main button), and everyone from my one year old daughter to my 85 year old dad have taken to without problems.  It's size and shape also support using it like a book (literally to read a book or web page), but you can also watch TV and films.Personally I'm also paranoid about my password getting \"hacked\", and someone running up a huge Amazon bill or buying stuff with my credit card on eBay.  Well one of the benefits of the iPad (and iPhone) is it's \"almost impossible\" to get a virus - one of the most common ways to get hacked.  This doesn't mean you shouldn't use strong passwords, (both Sony and Adobe got hacked), but it's reassuring to leave the Windows world behind.Finally, I love the way these devices (iPad, iPhone, Apple TV, Apple Mac), increasingly work together.  The fact you can start a Pages document on your Mac and edit it on your iPad, or take photos on the iPhone, and in seconds see them on the iPad or Mac and display them on the Apple TV.The thing is, \"it just works\".What would you use if for?----------------------------------* Shopping online.  Obviously - you could be reading a review on Amazon about the iPad Air!* Reading News stories.  As you can hold it like a book it's great to read the news online (my wife loves the UK Daily Mail newspaper Online - personally I prefer a web digest from free app Zite).* Reading Books.  It's great for reading books from Amazon Kindle or Apple Books with the benefit of 1,000s of online book reviews* Navigating web pages.  Instead of clicking with a mouse, you gently swipe your fingers on screen to scroll around* Watching Films.  I use it to watch Netflix online videos (with an Apple TV you can send stuff to the telly)* Reading and replying to mail.  I use \"mailbox\" a great free app to read and reply to mails, but there's a free one included* Showing and organising photos.  Any photos on an iPhone are automatically available within minutes in \"the cloud\"* Playing games.  From fun puzzle games like \"Cut the Rope\" to fully fledged first person shooters.* Listening to the Radio.  With \"Tune in Radio\" you can listen to thousands of radio stations world-wide.  My personal favourite is London UK based XFM - alternative rock* Listening to music.  I stream mine to an Apple TV, but you can also buy portable speakers or just plug into the AUX socket* The list goes on and on.Which model should I buy?----------------------------------I can't comment about Android tablets (apart from the Google Nexus which is well regarded), but in terms of the Apple tablet line-up in order of cost:-1. Avoid the Apple iPad 2, it's a relatively old model, under-powered and with a lower resolution screen.  If you really want an Apple but don't want to spend the cash, buy a 16g WIFI 3rd or 4th generation iPad from eBay.  Avoid this one.2. iPad mini is a lovely tablet.  A 7.9 inch screen and astonishingly light and remarkably thin - it feels like a light-weight book.3. iPad mini with retina screen. Again 7.9 inch screen, but with the blazingly fast A7 chip and a \"retina\" (high definition) screen.  Worth the upgrade if you can afford it.4. iPad Air.  Much larger screen size (9.7 inches - doesn't sound much but it makes a huge difference).  Same fast (A7) chip as the Mini with Retina - the latest and fastest iPad available.Clearly (from my viewpoint) there's only really three options.  The iPad Mini, the Mini with retina screen and Air.What are the Optional add-ons?-----------------------------------------Well, assuming you've dropped by the Apple Store (which I would highly recommend - fantastic service), and handled the iPad Mini (with/without retina screen), and iPad Air then your options are around memory size and cellular option.Memory:  Once bought, you can't add memory (space for apps, films, books etc).  However, the basic price goes up a huge amount (+$100 for the 16g to 32g iPad Air).  But, having owned a 16g and then a 32g iPad - I can safely recommend the 16g unless you really want to store a huge amount of videos and downloads.  Only you can decide, and if you're lucky enough that money is no object then splash out.  Otherwise, 16g should be fine for most people.Celular:  Allows you to connect to the internet while you're out and about.  This will add an additional +$100 to the price and means you can slip in a mobile phone SIM card.  This means (for an additional $5-10 a month extra), you can access the internet on the move.  Alternatively, you can opt for the WIFI option, and use it at home or at at \"hot spot\" (eg. Starbucks, most rail stations and hotels etc).Personally I'd buy (and indeed did), the 16Gb iPad Air WIFI.Do I need anything else?-------------------------------Most people (me included) buy a cover.  Apple (and now several copy-cats) make a \"smart-cover\" which automatically shuts down the iPad when you close it, and switches it on when you open it.  There's versions which cover the back, or just the screen.  Apple charge from $35 to $65 for their (admittedly) high quality fabric or leather covers, but there's many available from $10.  Be aware, you do get what you pay for.Personally,I think it's a pity to cover the beautiful aluminium industrial design of the iPad with a cover - but if you've spent hundreds of pounds you'll want to protect it from scrapes and bangs.I also invested in a keyboard ($20-$70), as I tend to write a lot of mails and documents (remember it comes with a word processor).  I'd recommend the ogitech Ultra Thin iPad Air Case with Keyboard - Space Grey and the ZAGG Keys iPad Air Case Folio with Backlit Keyboard although these are strictly optional unless you want to use your iPad as a proper laptop.Finally, if you have another Apple device (eg. an iPhone, Apple TV or Mac) you'll find these work together beautifully.  For example, you can create a reminder on your iPad and it appears on your iPhone.  Equally, photos taken on your iPhone appear on your iPad, and you can stream music or videos from iPad, iPhone or Mac to an Apple TV.Some people think this \"locks you in\" - but it's your choice.How should I set it up?--------------------------Well, if you already own an iPad or iPhone it's incredibly easy.  Just log in with your existing iTunes and iCloud accounts, and select the option to either set this up as a new iPad or restore from backup.If you've never owned an iPad before - read on to hear about how to set up an iTunes and iCloud account - it certainly confused me the first time I used them.+ iTunes account - is how you buy your music, Apps or films from Apple.  You register your credit card with them, and protect the account with a secure password+ iCloud account - is used to identify you as an individual.  This gives you 5Gb of backup space (your iPad will be automatically backed up when you charge it), and also means your iPad will work together with your iPhone.How to set them  up:1) Create a SINGLE iTunes account for your immediate family and children.  Then when you buy an App, it's immediately available (for free) to all the family members.  Maybe once the children reach 15-16 they'll want their own account (as otherwise they'll end up spending your hard earned cash on your credit card to buy music you don't want).  Until then - it's a great way to share the Apps.2)  Create YOUR OWN INDIVIDUAL iCloud account for person.  That means if you buy an iPhone you can share data (eg. reminders, notes or calendar events) across both devices.  If you're partner (and maybe even children) have their own iCloud account they also have 5Gb of space, and can keep their own notes and documents private.Easy when you know how.What's great about the Air?-----------------------------------* Lighter (30%) and thinner than the previous version (469g from 650g)* Even faster A7 chip.  Blazingly fast!* Improved sound (compared to the iPad 4)* Software including  + iMovie - edit and publish home made movies  + Numbers - Fully functional Excel for the iPad  + Pages - Word processor  + GarageBand - Play a piano or a drum kit  + iPhoto - Edit and organise your photosWhat's not so great?--------------------------* The change in physical size means you'll need a new keyboard or replacement cover if you're upgrading* Pity Apple didn't include the \"touch ID\" to secure your passwordsOverall Opinion---------------------It's hard to believe the iPad version 1 was released just four years ago, and there's a huge raft of \"me too\" tablet computers to choose from, but the Apple iPad Air is still the one to beat.As the UK based consumer magazine \"Which?\" magazine put it - \"...the best tablet we've ever tested.  Apple packs a beautiful screen and lightning fast processor into a slimmer-than-ever shell, and battery life is very impressive\".Yes, there are cheaper Android based alternatives, but the quality, design and beauty of this tablet just sets it apart.  If it were a car it'd be a top of the range Mercedes or a BMW.Highly Recommended.", "Date": "January 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "Daniel G. Lebryk", "ReviewID": "R2RCYFJ9NNSROC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The iPad Air is everything I imagined it would be and a lot more. This latest generation iPad is so much lighter than previous versions; it is now approaching the weight of a Kindle - meaning it is easy to hold for a long time. The body is about two inches narrower, making it easier to hold. The retina display is so darn sharp and looks great.The iPad Air finally pushed me to upgrade my original, version 1 of the iPad. I bought that iPad on release day, seemingly millions of years ago. I loved that device, my one complaint was that the iPad was too heavy - everything else about it was great. Now that I've used the Air, I'll never go back. This was an upgrade well worth doing.November 2, 2013 Update: After using this for two days and thinking harder about the iPad, I figured you might want a few reasons why this might not be for you. Your iPad works just great and you don't do much more than read email, play angry birds, and look at websites all at home. In my case I went from a slow turtle first generation iPad to this lightning fast new version - I'm blown away. And if you have a latest previous version and get a great deal on recycling your current model (read at least $200) then it might make a lot of sense. This is an expensive device, and a MacBook Air is not all that far away from the iPad, after you add $60 for a case, $100 for two years of accidental breakage coverage, and maybe $60 for a keyboard. A MacBook Air at $1100 suddenly doesn't look all that expensive anymore, especially if you opt for the 128GB option of the iPad. Of course there is nothing like holding one of these new iPads and they are super sweet. If you are super logical and conservative, this is probably not the device for you.On the other hand, I decided to jump in both feet first.Setup was super fast and easy. There is a good step-by-step wizard to get the device running. Since I have an iCloud account, I was blown away with how fast this thing synced. That whole improved WiFi antenna is not hype - the device connected quickly with my network. Most devices take a while to connect to my network, this was painless and fast. Filling in the information for my mail account, it seemed like seconds and new email was downloaded - significantly faster than my other iPad.I had a choice during set up to restore from a backup or set up the unit as new. I chose new device, so none of my apps loaded right away. If I had chosen a backup, I could plug this into my computer and with iTunes could have grabbed my purchased apps. All incredibly seamless.Video is stunning. Amazon Prime Video took seconds to start (I've gotten used to 15-20 seconds). The video started in standard def, and within 15 seconds switched to high def. So much faster than happens even on my PS3. I have never seen buffering move this fast, scanning forward, there was a 5 second delay for buffering and the movie resumed. Sound is much better than the single speaker. It is still not great, just more passable. It is silly that they put two speakers on the bottom of the iPad. A speaker on top and bottom would give movies stereo. Music sounds better. Two speakers put out more sound, the stereo effect is minimal, the two speakers are one inch apart.This is an incredible display for films. The blacks are deep, rich, and have great tone range. Out of the box, this display looks fantastic.Everything moves so darn fast. Switching apps is a snap. New apps load with a blink of an eye.I'm glad I bought the full size iPad; Apple got this size and weight exactly right. I think this is well worth the extra $100 over the retina mini to be released the end of November. Apple has blurred the lines between these two devices. I guess they've done the same thing with iPods, so it makes sense they would do it with the iPad.If you've used iOS 7 on an iPhone, the iPad is essentially the same thing - you will feel right at

I own an iPad 2 and 3 and now this new iPad Air version.  My main reasons for updating were that I literally fill up my 64 GIG iPad every day or two with videos and photos that I shoot.  Having this larger version at 128 GIG allows me to work longer and add more to my iPad.  In addition this new version is much lighter and easier to use all day long.  Even though the battery is smaller in capacity than my iPad 3 the battery life is longer and it is very noticeable. This is because the faster A7 CPU and the motion chip actually use less power.Please watch my video as I go into more details in it.I immediately noticed the increase in speed.  The unit connects to the WIFI faster, synchs with iTunes faster, downloads emails faster and speeds up your web browsing.  The differences are very noticeable and enjoyable as a user.  The dual speakers are a nice change but I also use a lot of Bluetooth speakers to enhance the sound of the iPad.In my video I do a size and weight comparison to an iPad 2, an iPad 3 and the iPad Air.  I also show how the basic set up takes place and for advanced users you can just speed through that portion of the video.  The iPad 2 weighs 1 pound 5 1/8 ounces, the iPad 3 weighs 1 pound 7 1/8 ounces, and the iPad Air weighs 1 pound and \u00bc ounce.  The iPad Air is narrower but has the same screen size.  The left and right edges of the iPad are thinner on the sides of the useable screen and you can see that in the video.Here are the key improvements for me:* Much lighter in weight* Thinner, smaller design with the same screen size* Much faster when synching with iTunes* Much faster when browsing the web* Much faster when downloading emails* Stronger WIFI connection and faster WIFI synching* A more powerful AC wall adapter with 5.2 VDC and an output of 2.4 Amps.  It charges at 12 watts of power. It operates at 100 to 240 VAC and 50/60 Hz and it is UL approved.  It features folding AC wall plugs for easy packing when traveling.* Lower CPU and motion chip power consumption that makes the smaller/lighter internal battery last longer!  This is very noticeable!* As usual a beautiful high resolution retina screen with 2048 by 1536 resolution at 264 pixels per inch.

I would have paid a little more for the iPad Air with that sensor.This is still a 5 star product and I recommend it as a very good tablet.", "Date": "November 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Beautiful product, non-premium hardware.", "Author": "Avenging Taco", "ReviewID": "R52KR35VM0NQ3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have owned several Apple products, and the iPad is the most distinguished among Apple's line up relative to its competition.  The most compelling aspects of this tablet are the beautiful design, and the 10 hour battery life.  These are the two features that made me decide to purchase another Apple product irrespective of their business practices which try to squeeze money out of their customers by not supporting devices properly after they are released.After having used this product for over a month now, I can say it is an improvement over my iPad 1.  The browser now crashes on the original to the point of making it worthless.  My original iPad had 256 MB of RAM which is not enough to load a lot of modern web pages without the browser crashing.  That is why I had hoped the 1 GB of RAM in the iPad Air would be sufficient, and it has improved, yet I still find that the browser crashes on occasion.  The scroll latency is very subtle, but noticeable to me.  It doesn't really impact my usage, but it could create problems for people who game on their iPads.  Putting in 2 GB of RAM (which is what I have in my Nexus 4) does not cost that much, and would improve the performance greatly.  For a premium product, I expect the best, and Apple has consistently under-delivered on processing hardware which created the same problems all the way back to the iPhone 1 I purchased on launch day.I take 1 star off for business practices which burn through your pocket, and the second star is removed for needless low-RAM browser crashes that are still a problem on the latest iteration (which is likely planned to force relegation of old devices and compel new sales.)  Still, I can say that this is the best 10 inch tablet available, and android has no viable alternative worth purchasing.  If you can overlook the two biggest strikes I have against Apple, you should consider no other 10 inch tablet at this time.UPDATE 1/17/14Today I called into Apple support because my browser is crashing frequently.  I am now experiencing 5 - 10 browser crashes a day when it was only 2 - 3 times a week when I first purchased it.  Speaking with the Apple support technician, he said that they have not received many complaints about this issue yet, so I may be experiencing a rare software or hardware problem.  I looked through my crash log (which had over 100 crash reports in it since Nov. 11th) and the vast majority of them were low memory crashes.  However, the tablet did not operate this way when I initially purchased it, and it began to increase in frequency about 2 weeks ago.  Therefore I suspect that there is a software conflict (I still have 4 GBs of free flash hard drive space, so I doubt it is a conflict with virtual memory, although a RAM hardware problem is possible).  I went through some basic procedures the technician recommended, and I was advised to do a system wipe if the problems should persist.  I will test the tablet for a few days before wiping everything and starting over. I'll update this review once I am confident of what the issue was.", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Apple still rules the tablet world.", "Author": "Makavelli02", "ReviewID": "R3AWGSO5C50M8A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of let me tell you I am not an apple fanboy. I own and support samsung products. I carry a galaxy note 2 with me every day and would not consider an iPhone until the make some huge changes to it. Last year I bought a nexus 7 and loved it. Now that it's specs are getting a little dated I had to look for an upgrade. The new nexus 7 didn't impress me with it's dated CPU. So I looked to the note 2014 and the iPad air. I used both side by side and researched every detail. I sell these things for a living. The note is very impressive but, for all it's stats and hardware features it still struggles with simple movements. You can point out is 3 gigs of ram and the very good snapdragon 800 quad core CPU. Then you have apples 1 gig of ram with the measly dual core a7 CPU. ????? Now for the real world facts and it pains me to say this because I love android, but the fact is the a7 in the iPad air with it's upgraded clock speed at 1.39 gigs has yet to be matched in any bench mark from another mobile processor including the quad core s 800 by snapdragon. And with the future in mind the 64 bit tech is hard to beat. Them to the 1 gig of ram vs the 3 gigs in the note. If you can't use all that horsepower why put it in there. The air is twice as snappy as the note with no lag what so every. The note on the other hand lags even on swiping through home screens. It all comes down to the operating system apple remains king. Android may be pretty and customizable but that all comes at a cost. That cost is performance. You can take a car with 500 horsepower and put it on a curvy bending road. All that horsepower doesn't mean a thing. The car with 200 horsepower will still win by going straight.So I bought the air and love it.

They all went back to the store after much disappointment & I would go back to reading on the Kindle App.The iPad Air has become my mini workstation, paired with an Apple wireless keyboard, my library, my entertainment zone where I watch movies, play games & listen to music. I can also shop, do research-the list is endless! The device is as light as air even with a leather cover. It stays cool-no overheating. It is fast & with 128g, there is room for what interests me.

I've had original iPad, iPad 3, and now the Air. Many people may say iPad is not worth the price for what it does, but in my case, it was worth every penny. I used iPad 3 and now the Air mostly for browsing the web, reading textbooks, and occasional gaming, and for these tasks iPad Air is perfect; not to mention, I've saved a couple of hundreds on textbooks already. Air is much lighter and faster than the other iPads I've had so far. Now, I can easily hold it longer while reading longer texts, and I can see the performance increase in web browsing and games.Mini vs. Air DilemmaI first got the new iPad Mini with Retina display, because the Apple sales person said it is identical to iPad Air in every aspect other than screen size. Of course it turned out to be wrong, since mini is a bit slower and has the display color accuracy issue. After a week, I went back and exchanged the mini for iPad Air. While mini is a wonderful tablet, I was keeping it much closer to my eyes that I liked to. Web browsing also suffered a lot on a smaller screen of the mini even with Retina. With iPad Air, everything is back to normal again, and I can browse the web more easily now.Wi-Fi vs. 4G CellularI have had the cellular version of iPad 3 and the original iPad. To be honest, I only enabled the service for a few months and disabled it afterwards. I find myself to be always near Wi-Fi networks, either at school or work, so I decided to get the Wi-Fi version this time. Another reason was that I can always turn on the Hot-Spot feature on my phone, and share the internet with iPad Air. Because of these points, it didn't make any sense to pay $130 more for the cellular version.Games and PerformanceI've tried a few games, including Dead Trigger 2, and the 3D performance is very good. The new A7 processor really shines here. I am sure new wave of 3D and 64-bits games will come to iPad pretty soon, and if you are into gaming, definitely go with larger than 16GB models. The web browsing performance has been increased as well, so you can browse the web more fluidly.ConclusionI am pretty happy with my purchase. The free iLife and iWork packages with the purchase of new iPad from Apple sealed the deal for me. It is much better than my previous iPad 3, and I definitely love the new reduced weight. The performance increase is also noticeable both in games and web browsing.

I am neither an apple/pc/android fanboy, I use the tool that gets the job done reliably. (Ever have a paper due and your computer breaks down?) I own a macbook, iphone, windows desktop, and had a Nexus 7 for a short time but wanted a tablet with a larger screen.So lets get down to it- initial impression was \"Wow!\" and I never realized how chunky or laggy the Nexus 7 was. The resolution, animations, user interface, and general build quality is superb in my opinion. It feels like a device \"that will get work done\". Unfortunately, the iPad out of the box feels like a digital storefront for the App store as opposed to something I can do school work on. Bluntly, the device is unnecessarily handicapped. For me to put my own videos on it, I have to use Handbrake and waste 3-4 hours to convert the movie to something the iPad can play. The Nexus 7 played almost any format out of the box. Using textbook PDFs is horrible, there are only a few quality apps that offer continuous scrolling. If your course requires mymathlabs, webassign, or one of those other edu-gimmicks to do homework, good luck, most of them require Flash which is unsupported. Then I went to use safari.. advertisements everywhere! Same with every free app, constant advertisements! Occasionally I have to download PDF to read for course work. Ain't happening in safari- there is no way to download and the page will refresh if you close the app. Good luck reading where there is no wifi.Then I jailbroke it, installed f.lux, adblockerNetworks, safari downloader, nitrous, retinapad, vplayer video player, and videopane. That took care of the blinding blue light at night time, killed off 90% of advertisements, I can download files now, iPhone only apps are now in HD, I can watch almost any format of video too. Now the device is useful!After that, I installed DocsToGo to read PDFs with continuous scrolling and to write papers. I also HIGHLY recommend Notes Plus if you intend on hand writing notes. Lastly, I would suggest getting the \"Papers\" app (no typo) to read PDFs with multiple columns.Overall, iPad has a lot of potential but is held back by Apples walled garden. After jailbreaking and eliminating the majority of the artificial handicaps, I feel OK with heading to school only with it and not worrying about it not being capable of doing something.

I own an iPad 2 and 3 and now this new iPad Air version. My main reasons for updating were that I literally fill up my 64 GIG iPad every day or two with videos and photos that I shoot. Having this larger version at 128 GIG allows me to work longer and add more to my iPad. In addition this new version is much lighter and easier to use all day long. Even though the battery is smaller in capacity than my iPad 3 the battery life is longer and it is very noticeable. This is because the faster A7 CPU and the motion chip actually use less power.Please watch my video as I go into more details in it.I immediately noticed the increase in speed. The unit connects to the WIFI faster, synchs with iTunes faster, downloads emails faster and speeds up your web browsing. The differences are very noticeable and enjoyable as a user. The dual speakers are a nice change but I also use a lot of Bluetooth speakers to enhance the sound of the iPad.In my video I do a size and weight comparison to an iPad 2, an iPad 3 and the iPad Air. I also show how the basic set up takes place and for advanced users you can just speed through that portion of the video.

The left and right edges of the iPad are thinner on the sides of the useable screen and you can see that in the video.Here are the key improvements for me:* Much lighter in weight* Thinner, smaller design with the same screen size* Much faster when synching with iTunes* Much faster when browsing the web* Much faster when downloading emails* Stronger WIFI connection and faster WIFI synching* A more powerful AC wall adapter with 5.2 VDC and an output of 2.4 Amps. It charges at 12 watts of power. It operates at 100 to 240 VAC and 50/60 Hz and it is UL approved. It features folding AC wall plugs for easy packing when traveling.* Lower CPU and motion chip power consumption that makes the smaller/lighter internal battery last longer!

Sure, the camera is a bit improved, but don't you think that people look odd trying to take photos on an iPad? For me, that's not what this is designed for.The first thing you'll notice when you pick it up is how sleek and light it is compared to previous models. It really is a beautifully designed and built tablet. It' also noticeably (but not hugely with the apps I tested) faster. iOS 7 looks fab on the thing.Still, the bottom line is, if you are running a pre-retina iPad and you got the cash, yes, it's worth it (and I use 'worth' as a loose term here, they are bloody expensive).

Bought the 2nd version, loved it and have had it ever since.  When they came out with the 3rd version I wasn't impressed with the changes so I kept my iPad 2.  Ditto when they came out with the next version.  But I saw the iPad Air in person and had a chance to try it for myself.  I loved the new camera (much more defined pictures) and the screen definition (it's now hi-def).  Beautiful sharp, clear colors.  So I upgraded and bought it (I bought the white one though.)  I was fortunate that the place I bought the iPad Air from accepted my iPad 2 as a trade in so I got it for approximately $200 less (my iPad was in immaculate condition and I still had the box, paperwork and the accessories.)  I do love this iPad.  It's fast, fast, fast and my games are beautiful.  I have both Microsoft and Apple products (although no Apple computers, they're too expensive.)  Both have their merits, but I have to say one thing for the Apple products, upgrading to new devices and transferring all your programs, particularly games, is so much easier.  On Microsoft products, with Windows, you have to reinstall all of your games and programs, and with the games pray that the new operating system will let you play your old games.  In most cases it won't and you have to go through a bunch of iterations to play them (and I say this while typing on an HP Laptop which I use daily and would rather DIE than go without it!)  I don't know why Microsoft, (maybe it's the game developers) won't let you back up your games or the programs like Excel, Word, etc (even though you've already paid for them.)  But with Apple you just attach it to your computer  and sync it (hopefully you backed up your iPad, or whatever, to it) and voila, all your previous games, music, programs are on the Apple product ready to use just where you left off (most of the time anyway.  On a few of the games I had to start from the beginning, but I think that's because of the developer, not the iPad because some of them I did start where I left off.)  Also, set up for programs such as mail is minimal (just put in your user name and password and you're ready to go.)  I wish Microsoft would come out with something like that so I could purchase a new computer without the fear of not being able to play my favorite games.  Anyway, bottom line I LOVE my new iPad Air.  I even found a case that allows me to swivel the stand to either landscape or portrait positions so that I can read the newspaper or books on it and eat at the same time without having to try and prop it up on something (bought the case on Amazon.com, it's a Targus Versavu).", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Incredibly light, fast and beautiful. Is it the best tablet for you?", "Author": "John Ryan", "ReviewID": "R3W2AOZWQH82BD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The new iPad Air is Apple's latest, slimmest, lightest release of their hand-held computer. Oddly enough, it's so beautifully easy to use (my one year old daughter loves playing with it), it's almost doesn't feel like a computer at all.A word of warning - this review is written for people who've never owned an iPad before - and are wondering what all the fuss is about. If you're thinking of upgrading skip down to the \"What's great about the Air\" section below, or just buy it - it's amazing.Just what's all the fuss about?--------------------------------------I used to own a laptop for work, and (very occasionally), it'd sit on my lap on the sofa, and I'd use it for pleasure (eMail, watching films or playing the odd game). Then I bought my first iPad, and the laptop became redundant, a boring \"work device\". Hard to explain, but the fact the iPad is so small and light, and you navigate around with your finger by pointing and gently swiping the screen makes the whole experience a lot easier - a lot more fun.Even my most \"luddite\" of friends have been won over.It's incredibly simple and easy to use (it only has one main button), and everyone from my one year old daughter to my 85 year old dad have taken to without problems. It's size and shape also support using it like a book (literally to read a book or web page), but you can also watch TV and films.Personally I'm also paranoid about my password getting \"hacked\", and someone running up a huge Amazon bill or buying stuff with my credit card on eBay. Well one of the benefits of the iPad (and iPhone) is it's \"almost impossible\" to get a virus - one of the most common ways to get hacked. This doesn't mean you shouldn't use strong passwords, (both Sony and Adobe got hacked), but it's reassuring to leave the Windows world behind.Finally, I love the way these devices (iPad, iPhone, Apple TV, Apple Mac), increasingly work together. The fact you can start a Pages document on your Mac and edit it on your iPad, or take photos on the iPhone, and in seconds see them on the iPad or Mac and display them on the Apple TV.The thing is, \"it just works\".What would you use if for?----------------------------------* Shopping online. Obviously - you could be reading a review on Amazon about the iPad Air!* Reading web pages. As you can hold it like a book it's great to read the news online (my wife loves the Daily Mail Online).* Reading Books. It's great for reading books from Amazon Kindle or Apple Books with the benefit of 1,000s of online book reviews* Navigating web pages. Instead of clicking with a mouse, you gently swipe your fingers on screen to scroll around* Watching Films. I use it to watch Netflix online videos (with an Apple TV you can send stuff to the telly)* Watching TV. With the free BBC iPlayer app you can catch up or download BBC programs* Reading and replying to mail. I use \"mailbox\" a great free app to read and reply to mails, but there's a free one included* Showing and organising photos. Any photos on an iPhone are automatically available within minutes in \"the cloud\"* Playing games. From fun puzzle games like \"Cut the Rope\" to fully fledged first person shooters.* Listening to the Radio. With \"Tune in Radio\" you can listen to thousands of radio stations world-wide.* Listening to music. I stream mine to an Apple TV, but you can also buy portable speakers or just plug into the AUX socket* Editing Word, Excel and Powerpoint documents using FREE App \"QuickOffice\" (owned and supported by Google).* Editing Pages, Numbers and Keynote documents (Office for the Apple) on the FREE Apple apps.* The list goes on and on.Update: You can edit Word, Excel and Powerpoint documents (plus Pages, Numbers and Keynote) on the iPad (although I'd recommend an external keyboard - see below). It's definately powerful enough, although I'd not expect these apps to cope with REALLY complex document layouts. Great for general letter and document writing though.Which model should I buy?----------------------------------I can't comment about Android tablets (apart from the Google Nexus 7 which is well regarded), but in terms of the Apple tablet line-up in order of cost:-1. Avoid the Apple iPad 2, it's a relatively old model, under-powered and with a lower resolution screen. If you really want an Apple but don't want to spend the cash, buy a 16g WIFI 3rd or 4th generation iPad from eBay. Avoid this one.2. iPad mini is a lovely tablet. A 7.9 inch screen and astonishingly light and remarkably thin - it feels like a light-weight book.3. iPad mini with retina screen. Again 7.9 inch screen, but with the blazingly fast A7 chip and a \"retina\" (high definition) screen. Worth the upgrade if you can afford it.4. iPad Air. Much larger screen size (9.7 inches - doesn't sound much but it makes a huge difference). Same fast (A7) chip as the Mini with Retina - the latest and fastest iPad available.Clearly (from my viewpoint) there's only really three options. The iPad Mini, the Mini with retina screen and Air.What are the Optional add-ons?-----------------------------------------Well, assuming you've dropped by the Apple Store or John Lewis (which I would highly recommend), and handled the iPad Mini (with/without retina screen), and iPad Air then your options are around memory size and cellular option.Memory: Once bought, you can't add memory (space for apps, films, books etc). However, the basic price goes up a huge amount (+\u00a380 for the 16g to 32g iPad Air). But, having owned a 16g and then a 32g iPad - I can safely recommend the 16g unless you really want to store a huge amount of videos and downloads. Only you can decide, and if you're lucky enough that money is no object then splash out. Otherwise, 16g should be fine for most people.Celular: Allows you to connect to the internet while you're out and about. This will add an additional +\u00a3100 to the price and means you can slip in a mobile phone SIM card. This means (for an additional \u00a37-15 a month extra), you can access the internet on the move. Alternatively, you can opt for the WIFI option, and use it at home or at at \"hot spot\" (eg. Starbucks, most rail stations and hotels etc).Personally I'd buy (and indeed did), the 16Gb iPad Air WIFI.Do I need anything else?-------------------------------Most people (me included) buy a cover. Apple (and now several copy-cats) make a \"smart-cover\" which automatically shuts down the iPad when you close it, and switches it on when you open it. There's versions which cover the back, or just the screen. Apple charge from \u00a335 to \u00a365 for their (admittedly) high quality fabric or leather covers, but there's many available from \u00a310. Be aware, you do get what you pay for.Personally,I think it's a pity to cover the beautiful aluminium industrial design of the iPad with a cover - but if you've spent hundreds of pounds you'll want to protect it from scrapes and bangs.I also invested in a keyboard (\u00a325-80), as I tend to write a lot of mails and documents (remember it comes with a word processor). I'd recommend the Logitech Ultra Thin iPad Air Case with Keyboard - Space Greyand the ZAGG Keys iPad Air Case Folio with Backlit Keyboard - Black although these are strictly optional unless you want to use your iPad as a proper laptop.Finally, if you have another Apple device (eg. an iPhone, Apple TV or Mac) you'll find these work together beautifully. For example, you can create a reminder on your iPad and it appears on your iPhone. Equally, photos taken on your iPhone appear on your iPad, and you can stream music or videos from iPad, iPhone or Mac to an Apple TV.Some people think this \"locks you in\" - but it's your choice.What's great about the Air?-----------------------------------* Lighter (30%) and thinner than the previous version (469g from 650g)* Even faster A7 chip. Blazingly fast!* Improved sound (compared to the iPad 4)* Software including+ iMovie - edit and publish home made movies+ Numbers - Fully functional Excel for the iPad+ Pages - Word processor+ GarageBand - Play a piano or a drum kit+ iPhoto - Edit and organise your photosWhat's not so great?--------------------------* The change in physical size means you'll need a new keyboard or replacement cover if you're upgrading* Pity Apple didn't include the \"touch ID\" to secure your passwordsOverall Opinion---------------------It's hard to believe the iPad version 1 was released just four years ago, and there's a huge raft of \"me too\" tablet computers to choose from, but the Apple iPad Air is still the one to beat. As \"Which?\" magazine (in the UK) put it - \"...the best tablet we've ever tested. Apple packs a beautiful screen and lightning fast processor into a slimmer-than-ever shell, and battery life is very impressive\".Yes, there are cheaper Android based alternatives, but the quality, design and beauty of this tablet just sets it apart. If it were a car it'd be a top of the range Mercedes or a BMW.Highly Recommended.", "Date": "February 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great, even for an Android fan.", "Author": "Xachary Dinsmore", "ReviewID": "RSJSN0GPTVMU4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have historically been an Android person, However, this time I decided to give Apple a whirl.

You are staring at all the apps at once from the home screen mo matter what. Even all neatly organized in folders it can still be a little hard to find what you are looking for. This coupled with the lack of information on the home screen(such as you get from a widget) would make me really dislike this on a small phone screen. It does work fairly well with the 10\" screen though, and the multi touch gestures make switching between apps and multi tasking a breeze.  This thing is extremely fast as well, you really can't slow it down. 10 browser tabs open, streaming music, playing a game, and checking your email, all while jumping back and forth between them is completely seamless. It literally feels like you can't feed it input fast enough to make it even stumble a little.  The battery life is also excellent. You will be hard pressed to kill it in a day. You would have to be gaming on it for hours to accomplish a dead battery I would think. I think the battery life is the perfect balance, to increase it any would in my opinion probably mean a sacrifice to either performance or weight and size. I typically get about 2 days of moderate use out of it.  For those of you on the edge between this and an Android device(or the constantly improving world of Windows mobile), the App Store selection is about the same. For the types of apps I use there seems to be very little difference, the are both excellent for social media, media consumption, email, and browsing the web. I do somewhat prefer the BaconReader reddit client app for android over what I have found here, but that is a very minor complaint. There are a few apps that are paid on iOS that you can get for free on Android, but at the same time there are more tablet specific apps on iOS, so I think it's a fair trade off.As far as day to day use goes it has been impeccable and I would recommend it to anyone. It has been reliable, fast, and had great battery life, any complaints are minor and subjective. In case Amazon rolls my review in with all the iPad Air models, which they probably will, I have the 32GB white version. I would also recommend avoiding the 16GB, after everything is all updated and the included free apps installed, you will only have a couple GB left for apps and media.", "Date": "March 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best tablet for normal people.", "Author": "T.

One of the first things that jumps out about this device, beyond the gorgeous display and excellent speed, is the long lasting battery life.  I have owned this tablet since the day it came out, and I am still averaging about 10 hours of battery life on it.  That is a good thing, too, because if one gets this tablet, they will be using it a lot.  That is, by and large, due to the tremendous versatility that the iPad Air provides it users with.  I have effectively utilized this tablet at both work and in my graduate courses, and by my judgement, my performance has seen a boost by consequence of that.With that in mind, it must be acknowledged that the iPad Air, or more generally, apple products are more expensive.  Critics of the iPad often point to that very fact, but a \"premium\" price boost to a top of the line product is not unique to the iPad - the nicest things are also invariably the most expensive things.  Because this tablet is so well made, there will typically be very little to no frustration associated with it.  It gets the job done across the board, be it for personal or professional use.  It is for that reason that the iPad Air is worth the extra $100-300. As a graduate student, I cringed at my bank account after I purchased this, but at this point, I'm honestly relieved that I got the iPad.  $600 may seem like a lot at first, but by the time a month has gone by, and one realizes how much they actually use this thing, that $600 will start to seem like a small price to pay.

In my case, Verizon had to scan the IMEI of one of their own devices in order to activate one of their own SIMs to use in this Air so that it could be added to my existing account and used on their network.

Basically Apple can thank my optometrist. That being said this thing is gorgeous. It takes beautiful photos and video, the screen is crisp and clear. While I don't run around in public taking photos and video with it I'm happy it has the capability. It's great for watching movies on the go and I've been very happy with the battery life.So why should you buy this one? It's a reasonable size without sacrificing screen size or quality. I think the ipad mini is cute but I have friends who practically have smartphones with a screen that size. It wasn't worth the price for me. We have other ipad products in my family, I've never been motivated enough to go out and buy my own but this one is a good size.

I mentioned Samsung because I love their phones, tv's, etc. However, when comparing the note to the iPad, I opted for the iPad. One very big reason is I love to buy, rent, download movies to watch. Having an iTunes account makes this so very simple. Also, I have a ton of iTunes credit (I always ask for iTune gift cards whenever the occassion arises). In addition to iTunes, I love Pages. When I got this app, it was free! However, if you do a lot of word processing, you might want to invest in this much needed addition. The great thing about Pages is you can send as a PDF or Word doc via email.Some are trying to decide if they should buy a 16, 32, 64, etc. Speaking from experience, a 16 will not be enough for must adults, but would be fine for a child. I know you can store in the \"cloud\". However, you have to have a wifi in order to retrieve from the \"cloud\" unless you have the iPad with a cellular service (which to me, is a waste). So, having your documents available whenever needed is a plus. Therefore, a minimum of 32 would be great.All said, I love gadgets and technology. I love having the latest, and that is why with each new model, I will upgrade. However, I think this iPad air will be mine for many years - of course I say that until the next iPad air comes out with the finger print scanner and I will tell myself, \"must have\".If you own one, enjoy!

As an upgrade from prior iPad's, the Air is going to be the biggest reason to upgrade in recent memory. Users from the 3rd Generation down will see substantial benefits to speed alone.What Works:It's substantially lighter. Easier to hold and use while watching movies or reading a book.It's substantially faster. The upgraded processor is so fast that most users will be future proofed for the next two years or more. 64 bit processing will give this tablet some legs.the battery charges substantially faster. This is a nicer reason to upgrade than most realize. The Air's battery is smaller, and holds it's charge very well compared to older models on iOS7. I had problems on my 3rd gen keeping it charged compared to the zippier charging Air.Lightning port is much more convenient, easier to plug in compared to 3rd generation and back.Speakers seem to pack more of a punch.What doesn't work:the screen has a slightly hollow and thin feel on the finger. As a consequence of a lighter tablet it's expected that the display lost some of it's heft.the volume buttons are spaced a little too far apart for me. Harder to press.volume speakers are annoyingly where you'd hold the tablet horizontally.-----That's my impressions with the tablet. My recommendation is if you have $500 or more to spend on a tablet, the iPad Air is going to be your first choice. Android hasn't been competitive in this section of the market. If you're looking for a less expensive, smaller tablet, then you're going to be looking at the Kindle devices or the Android devices.For Apple users, i'd recommend people on the 1st and 2nd gen devices take the plunge, the changes are enough to warrant the upgrade. 3rd Gen users are in the grey area. They are not going to see any difference in screen quality, and the speed of the Air may not be too large to matter for basic use. 4th Gen users are totally fine where they are.", "Date": "November 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "REPLACED MY IPAD 3, WAS IT A GOOD DECISION? LETS FIND OUT. IN DEPTH.", "Author": "Kanwar Anand", "ReviewID": "R104L6A6P3VSAW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my third iPad. I decided on a 32GB because I wanted to load movies on it and a lot of music and not worry about space. I mean when they announce a new version of iOS the last thing I wanted to do was delete something dear to me. I was replacing my iPad 3 16GB with an iPad Air 32GB. There have been many changes. Are these changes enough to warrant the need for an upgrade? I am still not entirely certain but I am more happy than sad about doing that. I haven't been able to sell my iPad 3 but its still looking for a new home. So guys, here is what I like about the iPad Air, what I don't like much and what are some key features or new introductions to this device.The Positives of Upgrading to iPad Air -1) It is lighter, the surface area around the display has been reduced, the design is not revolutionary by any length of a realistic understanding of science but it still has the same battery life. It has lost that annoying 30 pin connector which seems so inconvenient to the new lightning port. I can use this one hand, I can expect the same battery life, the volume button on the iPad 3 seemed less delicate, the iPad Air definitely feels a lot more delicate than the iPad 3 which seems so robust now when I pick it up. But overall I would give them 4 stars for the design changes.  I wish it never heated up though but purely from the WEIGHT difference I think its good, the screen for some reason looks better, it must be the upgraded graphic chip.2) The Sound - This is the biggest winner for me. Imagine not having to turn the sound to 100% on your iPad air. It rivals my matchbook air in terms of how loud it is, yes it isn't as loud or roomy or filling but it is more than satisfying. They now have two speakers so its a stereo sound. It is louder than my iPhone 5 and certainly more clear, catchy, bass adoring than I would image from an iPad. This was the surprise winner for me. A bit of a let down in terms of design is that if you're lying and watching a film in portrait mood the speaker sound may be muffled by your stomach/body part in contact with the base of the iPad air. The solution is LANDSCAPE mode. The two speakers are now located on the left and right side of the charging port. No complaints on this. The iPad 3 is maybe 30% as loud as the iPad air.3) Battery Life/Faster Charging Speed - I don't know why but I feel the iPad 3 had a longer battery when it was new. A new apple iPad will last you so long, it will need for you to bore it to death to bring it from 100% to 64%. Yes, this is the case with the new iPad but it isn't as good but overall the fact that charging time seems to have reduced by half is a big big big big winner for me. So overall, no complaints. I don't get 13-14 hours like I used to with my iPad 3. I get 11 hours. Yes, I make the best use of the new sound feature. The fact that it charges faster means I don't need to pull it out before 100% and this is a good thing for the battery. With the iPad 3, I have to wait for it to be 100% charged and it can take unto 8 hours. This has been reduced by almost half and I feel 4-5 hours will give you a 100%.4) Processor - The iOS 7 clearly stalls a bit on the iPad 3. Did I notice this before buying the iPad Air? Yes cause my iPhone 5 was faster than the iPad 3. If you're playing quiz up, everything loads in seconds, if you are browsing, it goes boom boom boom like my macbook air. Well nothing quite compares to browsning on the AIR but this is very good. iPad Air is the best device for youtube because of the loud speaker, I can sit with it for hours and discover various things. The processor seems to heat a lot less. There  is never a lag on anything. It doesnt think so much.5) Camera - Camera has improved from the iPad 3. Both the front and the back is more defined. Do I use this? Why wouldn't i?COULD HAVE BEEN BETTERS' WITH THIS IPAD AIR -1) Headphone Jack Placement/Volume Output -  This isn't as loud when using with headphones as the iPad 3 used to be. It is a more customised sound. The headphone jack is located at the same place where it used to be but because the surface area is smaller, I have found that when I am lying down and using my iPad AIR, the wires often get a bit entangled.2) The iPad Air still heats up. I can't for the life of me figure out why I pay a company so much money when they make a product that heats up on full brightness. This is one hell of an annoying feature.3) The back on the iPad Air, the volume buttons, the power button, the menu button - they all seem a bit too delicate in comparison with the iPad 3. This is just an intuition or impression but I can't help but feel it needs to be treated gently.4) Safari has been needing an overhaul for the longest and I feel they need a better browser than the one they have right now. It often freezes on my iPad 3. It should be perfect like iMessage is perfect, like FaceTime is close to perfect, like email is perfect, it isn't quite up there. I would give it a 6/10 in terms of potential.5) iBooks - I read on my iPad more than anything else but the iBooks software also needs some more options of backgrounds and schemes. Apple plays safe for far too long but they need to give more options to make READERS WANT TO READ MORE.6) Syncing iTunes is a bit confusing. There should be more education given to all customers about preferred type of WIFI networks, sometimes applications don't update, I have no idea why they are doing this. I have to go to airplane mode and then go back up. The iCloud feature needs 10GB and Apple need to stop being a cheapskate.Conclusion  -Get the iPad Air if you are looking for something with good design quality, good battery, an extra lightning cable (half joke) , something faster, smoother...this is about a 31% improvement over the iPad 3. Thats a big deal.Of my iPhone, macbook Air, iPad Air - I have always liked the iPads the most. They have reliable battery and never ever ever die on you like the other two. Its that simple and that keen.If they take into account some of the things I didn't like about this product, Apple can be made better overall.

I got it the day it came out in stores. It starts with the ultra-sharp exterior. If you loved last year's iPad Mini, you'll feel right at home with the Air. Apple essentially built a larger version of the Mini with the Air, by slimming the beveling of previous iPads to achieve a sleeker framework.The lack of heft makes the Air just a little more comfortable: An LTE-equipped Air weighs all of 1.05 pounds. Wrapped in a comfy and protective Apple Smart Case, the Air weighs 1.368 pounds, still lighter than a third-generation iPad by itself. Despite the lack of size, the Air is no less tough. It's sturdy and not at all easy to bend.The Air feels that much more like an electronic magazine. The Retina display, once the standard for all screens but also facing more competition this year, helps that; reading text and viewing web pages on that crystal-clear, pixel-dense screen is the same joy it was when Apple first built Retina screens into its tablets early last year.If this is all Apple did, it would likely still be enough to keep it on top. But the iPad Air does far more, starting with the new processor powering the entire experience, the A7. The same dual-core, 64-bit A7 chip that debuted in the iPhone 5S is in the iPad Air; and initially, this seems like a disappointment. In theory, you expect something more in Apple's flagship tablet, something a bit more powerful, with perhaps more graphical horsepower.In practice, you won't notice a thing. Web browsing and apps still handle as snappily as ever, even if you have a gaggle of things running in the background. Top-tier games such as Infinity Blade 3 continue to deliver. A pleasant surprise is also how quickly some of the beefier games, such as Anomaly 2, loaded, compared to previous iPads. You'll move into and out of levels just a little bit more swiftly, and that helps make the entire gaming experience more friendly and natural. It's hard to know what this really means for Apple gaming, but don't rule out the possibility of more console titles being ported to the iPad.Apple realizes the limitations of the 64 GB storage too, offering a new 128-gig model. You'll pay a more-than-average-laptop premium here ($799 for the WiFi-only model and $929 for an LTE version), but the improved storage is intriguing, especially for those planning for a game-heavy future. I can now easily and comfortably load all the music and movies onto the iPad Air that I want and still have plenty of room left over for games such as XCOM: Enemy Unknown and Civilization: Revolutions.Battery life is steady, even if it's not mind-blowing. Apple claims the iPad Air can get you 10 hours on a charge, and that's definitely true. Even when using Apple's navigation for a long trip to Washington, I easily got through a day without needing to charge; and more casual usage, such as Web browsing and email checks, is no problem.The Air's lone shortcoming is that it lacks the fingerprint identification technology that debuted on the iPhone 5S. But I'd be hard-pressed to claim that this was some glaring omission; every other tablet you're going to use this year lacks such tech, and I've never seen that tech as an absolute must-have.The resulting tablet is as pleasant to use as they come, and it's backed by some consistently solid software. Android has made a tremendous run over the past few years, and a plethora of both Android and Windows Mobile devices are truly intriguing this holiday season. But if there's one consistent shortcoming on those devices, it's the up-and-down support of operating systems.It's hard to know whether this Android tab or that will support Google's latest OS, but that's almost never a problem with iPads. iOS releases are generally consistent and stable, the lone knock on Apple being its lack of Android-like customization.And while the Apps Store and iTunes are also battling competition from Microsoft's stores and Google's Marketplace, Apple's setup continues to set the bar, managing to be intuitive and easy to use and enjoying more and more high-profile digital releases.", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love It!", "Author": "Amy Leftis", "ReviewID": "R9JQAS7K7K0PK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Much faster than the original ipad.

As light and thin as this tablet is it still feels solid and sturdy. The screen is beautiful and the colors are deep and rich.

I was a previous Iphone user that moved on to Android because I didnt like the size of the 5.  I have two kids so consumer level usability is high on my list especially with a son that has autism.My choice came down to a samsung or the ipad since the nexus 10 2 is still MIA. :)  The samsung had several things going for it.  MicroSD, customization and control, mutliple user profiles but to be honest their overlay is a huge turn off and the plether backing with fake stitching just looks horrid.  I would say that the plastics are fine but why bother with fake stitching? I spent time in a B&M; and the feel was good, but visually as a whole it felt less...high end even with the price being in the same range as the IPad.  With several cloud storage options and knowing that I would be using it for light work related items and sharing it with my kids to some extent the MicroSD while nice was not compelling.  I do wish apple would realize that multiple user accounts would be helpful because that is one of the things that almost moved me to the samsung.  Both screens of course are amazing and I have to give it to the samsung on using a better aspect ratio for media, but the samsung felt klugy when trying to use it in portrait.  So with all this being debated in my head for a few weeks back and forth I decided on the IPad.  As an aside, I love the build quality and would have seriously considers a Kindle Fire HDX but the lack of the google play store put it out of contention.  It is one thing to have a walled garden like apple where just about any app you can think of is available, but it is quite another to have a walled garden like Amazon where you either have to root or sideload to simply get some basic useful apps.  If the Kindle Fire HDX had google play store, this might have been an entirely different review. :)Two things have stood out as I have delved back into the walled garden that is Apple...One, It may be a walled garden, but it is a gorgeous garden.  The app quality and availability is outstanding. If they allowed Google Play Music I would not have any issues at all with the app store.  I think that the tighter development control that apple institutes on its apps is a double edged sword in some respects but I have not had anywhere near the amount of bugs that I find in the android store apps so in that respect I appreciate that 98.7% of the time when I download an app it just works.  I use it with several google services including chromecast and have been very happy with the results. On a side note, the hardware and build quality is meticulous and the IPad itself is even more impressive after prolonged use, but that has been discussed and beaten like the proverbial dead horse.Two, battery life.  Apple seems to know how to eek out the battery life with more finesse than some competitors.Overall I like the IPad Air much more than I thought I would.  I bought it knowing from a techie nerd stand point what I was giving up with the ecosystem and I have had no regrets at this point.  I can use it for work emails and presentations and come home to play netflix or games with the kids.

He loved it so much that we got one for him. We bought the Apple cases for both of them and my husband bought the stylus, as well.We  are both very pleased with these tablets. My husband has a neurological condition and the accessibility features and stylus have been wonderful for him. He stopped using his laptop for portability, because the iPad Air does everything he wants. We were afraid it would be too heavy for him to hold, but he has found it to be lightweight and comfortable, and it does weigh less than earlier iPads. Anyone with vision and fine motor skills problems is almost certain to love the iPad Air, especially when combined with the stylus.I dropped my iPad twice when in parking lots, both times from low heights, but on hard surfaces. The case protected it and I have had no problems resulting from the drops.We use our iPad Airs primarily for reading Kindle books. Our joint account has a huge archive and our other devices were not handling it. The K4iPad app and this unit work beautifully together and we have had no problems accessing our books. This iPad is powerful.We were worried about how comfortable it would be to read for long periods because we kept hearing that tablet screens bothered one's eyes. We found it easy to use the settings to adjust the screen lighting, and found an adjustment that has caused no eye problems, even when reading for several hours. It has been very comfortable. We have also read in fairly bright sun with no problems. However, when the sun was actually hitting the screen, it was impossible to read on it.We do use the iPad Air for many other functions. Games, surfing the web, eMail, videos, music, photos, YouTube, social networking sites, and so on, work as well as on a computer. The battery lasts a long time and the 3G is a real bonus when wi-fi is not available.I have seen some negative reviews of the iPad Air, and I don't doubt that some people have had bad experiences. All I can say is that we have had good experiences with Apple. Our iMac was out of warranty and still working when Apple notified us they were replacing the hard drive on all iMacs like ours, because the hard drives had an unacceptable failure rate. When we took it in to the Apple store, I asked them to also check my iPod Touch, which was two years out of warranty and had become very temperamental and glitchy. They found a corrupted file on the iPod Touch and got it set up and working for me, and didn't charge anything.  We have had good experiences with the iPad Air and are extremely happy with both of ours.", "Date": "June 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Wonderful", "Author": "Brad Potts", "ReviewID": "R1IOW55MJ0WJHD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a ergonomic, user friendly, electronic media formate for the casual user.

At 467g the Air redefines computer portability and is so lightweight it's hard to tell whether you're carrying it in your bag or have in fact forgotten it, without looking to check. The Air has a fast A7 chip and the screen is a useful 9.7 inches; it's a breeze to use. The design of the graphics is so intuitive that any child or technophobe can master it and feel at home in a few minutes, which makes it the perfect entry-point into IT for someone who has so far avoided computers.One of the clever things Apple have done is the creation of the individual `Apple ID' which means once you enter your ID & password your iPad, iPhone, iPod and Mac immediately share all their files, and everything you created or stored on one device becomes available on them all: photos, music, reminders, address book, documents are all shared. This is probably the most brilliant idea ever in the IT mass market to create brand loyalty among consumers and `locks you in to the corporation for the duration'.Now, the bad news: the software crashes from time to time necessitating a reboot, which is annoying and inconvenient. This fault is acknowledged by Apple, as the software has a few bugs. Also the wireless reception is not all it might be, as it sometimes (mysteriously) fails to connect to even a moderately strong signal.Apple's pricing structure does not reflect the cost of manufacture but is driven by a market segmentation strategy, so the price really cranks up if you want an iPad with more memory or which can use the GSM phone network. The best value is the 16G Air without Cellular, which only connects to the internet via WiFi. 16G is a lot of memory by the historic standards of portable computers and you'll only find it insufficient if you want to store a lot of big files like films or powerpoint presentations.You'll need a carrying case to protect it (scores of different designs are available) and maybe a keyboard, which if you're doing a lot of writing and document creation rather than just surfing the internet is the one essential accessory, as without a separate keyboard the usable screen area is reduced in size. Around one million downloadable apps for Apple devices means you can personalize your iPad and make it into more or less whatever you want. The Air design is aesthetically a work of beauty in its simplicity, cleanness of lines and proportion, and despite some irritating niggles is a pleasure to own and use.", "Date": "January 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Always love Apple", "Author": "Patricia Coykendall", "ReviewID": "R2Q8KB9C8ZHKQW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "All said it would be and more, had the I pad 2 and this is so much faster and lighter", "Date": "January 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love it, love it, LOVE IT!!!", "Author": "Maryanne", "ReviewID": "RX8WHXEP7PHLS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I honestly love this tablet like crazy! It has great battery life, just like they claim. I had my younger cousins go on it and even though they were playing games and watching movies the whole time, the battery still lasted all day! The screen is also great, maybe it's not the best on the market but I can barely even tell the difference and it's still exquisite. The processing power is also outstanding and I couldn't need anything faster. Internet is very fast as well.

The big thing is I've always liked the iPad as a concept but I've never fully fallen in love. I bought an original iPad, 2, and 3 but ended up selling them not long after because of a couple reasons. Mainly they just felt a bit like a luxury item I didn't have much use for and they weighed just enough to be uncomfortable to hold for a long period.The weight is now a complete non-issue. I fall back in love with it every time I pick it up because it just feels so perfectly designed for being held and interacted with. It also feels like much more than a luxury because of how much usability it now has. There are so dang many things I can do on my iPad, things I used to need my pc to complete. This is partly because of improvements by Apple but its also the simple benefit of web and app developers designing their services with mobile in mind.I can only imagine this comes off as a completely biased review but know I didn't get this device expecting to be so happy with it.

When I tried to activate my accounts it would not allow it because apparently since I changed carriers I could not use my old Apple ID because it is tied to the old carrier. I can't establish a new Apple ID because I have an old one and if they delete the old one I lose all the apps I've paid for. I contacted Apple Technical where I was required to purchase tech support before they would do anything.  After doing this I went through multiple calls with multiple levels of support over three days so far with more to come. Seems that if the tech makes a mistake it stops the process and you have to wait 24 hours for them to be able to continue. They promise to call back and so far they have not so I called them to start the frustrating cycle all over again. I can't get the apps I want until this if fixed. I also can't connect to Facebook. For a machine this expensive plus having to pay for tech support for something that is Apple's fault I now believe Apple products aren't worth the gas to go buy one. I've been using Apples since the Apple Plus and I feel abused as a customer for the IPAD AIR. On top of all this they just had the gall to send me an email thanking me for contacting Apple Support. They have charged me for something a user should be able to do online with a new machine that is supposed to be the latest and greatest and it is just a paper weight right now. Can't return it because there is nothing wrong with it. Seems to me Apple is unethical and does not care about customers after a purchase.

However, compared to the iPad2, it does have a bigger processor, significantly better camera and, on the downside, costs about $100 more.

As our first tablet, we were mainly looking for a mobile media hub that also can perform various utilities that we find important (finances, travel guides, recipes in the kitchen, ebook reading).

Google it first with \"How do you transfer multiple folders to iPad?\" and read what others have said.

The hardest choice.", "Author": "Mumbly Joe \"MumblyJoe\"", "ReviewID": "R1EP8MRB01CCTV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A lot of people have already talked about the merits of this device and the pros and cons. For me the decision wasn't so much which to buy but rather which one I wanted. Originally I got the mini to replace my kindle touch because of the price and the pocketable size. Ultimately I ended up with the air. Here's why:Grip: despite the very comfortable dimensions for 1 handed holding of the mini the extra thin bezel proved problematic. The palm rejection tech is supposed to be quite good but I found it unreliable and for those times I wanted to gets.  Eventually I always wanted to get a hold of it with  the bezel between my thumb and forefinger but either ended up with a thumb right in the middle of whatever I was watching or a hand cramp.Real estate: getting smaller means text is smaller especially on we pages In portrait mode. You can set the text size up for dynamic type but it doesn't work everywhere and when if does work and you change to landscape, then the text is far too big for the screen. Furthermore, in games where part of the screen is used for the controls I ended up wishing for a larger screen.Keyboard: the keyboard ended up being the main reason I went for the Air. While it is surprisingly good on the mini (really it blew me away how good the keyboard was in the mini) typing at that size for any extended period is taxing and it just can't compete with the Air if you plan on writing any amount. Furthermore, using the GarageBand keyboards are fairly awkward on the smaller screen. Unlike the accessory keyboards for the full size iPads, I found the external keyboards for the mini were actually much much worse than the onscreen keyboard.Pocketability: the mini fit quite nicely into a jacket pocket, in the climate where I live jackets are only really feasible about 3 or 4 months out of the year. Other than that it needs bag of some sort, which is really the same situation I'd be in with an Air.Weight: this made the choice the hardest. Holding the iPad mini feels like hardly anything at all. The iPad air feels considerably heavier. That affects everything you do with the tablet and the entire interaction with it. Fortunately it's mostly a matter of perspective. Put down the mini for a day and all of a sudden the air seems  quite light.For me the decision was made for the larger version but what about options?Cellular of no cellular? The free 3G on my kindle touch has gotten me out of a scrape more than once and having access to a no-strings-attached internet connection is guaranteed to come in handy at least once during the lifetime of your tablet. $130 is a lot to spend though, especially if you have a smart phone and free tethering on your plan. Originally I went for the wifi version for precisely this reason. However, the ability to tether is dependent on the carrier you happen to be using. Should you switch phones, carriers or plans or simply lose the phone while traveling tethering May no longer be a option and it's never going to be as convenient as simply opening the settings on your iPad and activating a plan. In addition you also gain the ability to use gps with a cellular modem and gain the benefits of enhanced find my iPhone accuracy in the event that it's stolen and the thieves know enough to keep it off wifi. Finally though, the possibility of a free 200 mb per month with t-mobile and the ability to switch carriers at will ended up pushing me to get the cellular version.So, after having initially been interested by the mini, a lot  of research, even more indecision and having bought, lived with and sold multiple versions of this thing I can safely say that the iPad Air with cellular is the  version I'd pick. If you don't plan on typing a lot with it though or watching movies, go for the mini.", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "First Ever Apple Product - First Ever iPad - LOVE IT", "Author": "JoHarley", "ReviewID": "R1X2GEOQACNWD2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The has become a great tool for my photography needs.

If I held this up facing toward you with a first gen Ipad, and an Ipad 2, you would not be able to tell the difference, you know why that is....becasue there is none. Ohhh the new version of IOS has slightly different looking icons....it's still the same locked, limited, crippled Iphone OS on a larger screen.  It's a giant, thinner iphone. A total waste of money, espessially when there are vastly better options available from Microsoft and Android that can outperform this toy any day of the week in features and power.", "Date": "December 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Lol.", "Author": "Max \"Boston\"", "ReviewID": "R28WHNGRGRKWRU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "People are going crazy for an ipad coming out a tiny bit thinner, and a little bit more powerful (because we know that app really requires the mega power).
