Stapleton", "ReviewID": "R3J9TAZB9U6UBV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had my Tursion 4GB tablet with Android 4.0.4 on it for more than 8 months and have had little trouble with it.  Has all the features listed except for the HDMI output (which I already knew it wouldn't have, not for its price).  All the features is does have work fairly well for a bargain tablet:Pros1) Capacitive screen is responsive and fairly fast.2)  Screen output is clear and sharp, good enough for someone who wears reading lenses to happily watch TV programming and movies on it.3)  Mini-USB connection transfers reasonably fast data or varying sizes and types.4)  SD card slot (something a lot of name brand manufacturers STILL won't put in their tablets!) works like a charm.  Got a generic 32GB SD card in it that works beautifully.5)  Audio is very good, but I haven't found a case for it yet that doesn't muffle it a bit because the speaker is on the back.  Even with it in a case, audio is still quite snazzy.  It's my pr6)  Headphone jack is solid and works nicely with anything I plug into it.7)  The 3 touch buttons on one side (depending on its orientation) on the front work exactly as designed (standard Android options).8)  Auto-orientation is quick and works well for Android and all apps designed to recognize it.9)  Battery life runs 8-10 hours without WIFI engaged.10). One last detail: it's 3G capable according to the onbard device listing.It's not as fast as a laptop or desktop (of course not!), nor as fast and powerful as an iPad or other high-end tablet (of course not!), and I'm very satisfied with using it to read books, watch movies, listen to music, occasionally check email and visit the rare website with it.  Do not expect full-sized performance from any tablet, including this one.Cons:1)  Battery life only 4-5 hours with WIFI engaged.  Install anything graphic intensive (like Live Wallpaper, movies and/or other eye candy) and it will cut life down by 1/3 or so.2)  The 1.3MP camera is pretty bad, even for that range.  Either Android handles it badly or the hardware simply sucks.  Not a big deal for me, I have an Android phone I depend on for pictures and video.3)  I've had the occasional odd issue where it won't come back out of screen shut-off, but that's been solved by holding down the power button until it forces a shut down and then powering it back up - same thing I do with full-sized laptops and desktops when they're being flaky (don't let anyone fool you otherwise - ALL computers, tablets to desktops and everything in between flakes like this now and then).4)  Mini-USB and dedicated power connections are loose and tend to fall out if not watched.  Could use some minor engineering improvements.5)  Can't find any linking information online to Tursion or any company that supports these units (spec information on tablet says it's a model F721).  Basically, it means that if you want tech support or to upgrade Android on it, you're out of luck as Tursion is most likely a subsidiary of a larger Chinese manufacturer who doesn't support the unit after distribution.  It's a shame, but once again: this is a bargain tablet, and 4.0.4 seems to do a pretty good job", "Date": "February 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's okay for the price", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1IMX36HE2OR2A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The tablet is a nice tablet for the price.

I read some reviews mentioning a cloudy screen, but I don't see any problems with it.  It's not HD but  it's still fine.

My cat has a nasty habit of getting on the table and knocking everything to the floor and he couldn't resist when he saw this tablet laying there.

Patton", "ReviewID": "R1SLQHH2XX1R5O", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "11/9/12 - I ordered this Tablet from Value Max and it arrived within a day using Prime shipping.  The device itself is very sleek and it powered up immediately, with a nominal charge on the battery.  As I installed apps and played with the settings, I went to adjust the brightness and the screen went dark.  Nothing I could do could bring the screen back. After searching on the internet, I discovered that this was described as a \"voltage problem\" and that flashing the device with firmware update should fix it.  This, however, did not work for me.David at Value Max was polite and seemed concerned, but had little-to-no knowledge about the device.  He promised a return call after talking to the person in charge of QC, but three days later I have still not heard from him and when I went to call him back the second day I got a busy signal.  I began to fuss around with the buttons and after pressing and holding both the volume up button and the power button, the screen came to live in some sort of programming/recovery mode.  I deleted the cache and then selected factory reset.  The device booted up with no trouble and the screen was normal again.  I had to reinstall all of the apps, but my e-books and other content were still on the device. I am not sure if this brightness thing is a common problem or if it affects my tablet in particular.Since the reboot, I have had no trouble at all.  I purchased this tablet to use as a e-reader for books and graphic novels and it does the job amazingly.  The Netflix app worked, but it was a little slow.  Also, the  video resolution on the screen was less than ideal. When I uploaded an HD movie to the device, it played and looked fine.  Not iPad clarity, but good enough.  I don't keep many apps open on the device at once and, especially with the Wifi turned off, the battery lasts.  Three hours of reading reduced it by about a third.  After the screen had been off for a few hours, the battery hadn't diminished any further.It's not very sturdy. I think one good drop would wreck it, but for $100 it is a great device.  It works well for reading books or e-mail.  I don't plan to use it for video, but it performed well when I was trying it out with the Netflix App, YouTube app, and movies on the hard drive.  All in all, I am pleased with it thus far.UPDATE: Device eventually went tits-up right after Christmas. Seller refunded the price and I ended up going with an LG Tablet. $100 more (at the time) but worth every extra penny.", "Date": "November 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "touchscreen TERRIBLE, units junk.", "Author": "Julz", "ReviewID": "RLGMWT4OQVGZR", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I went out on a limb and bought 2 of these for my kids instead of only being able to afford 1 for them to share.

The screen and electronics fall out of the backing case easily, the buttons fall out and down into the case (my son's we have to turn on by pushing something into the hole the button used to be in, daughters were able to retrieve and repair) And that was the FIRST WEEK. Week 2, both suddenly (on different days) shut off and wouldn't charge or respond at all. Trial and error found they WILL charge thru USB port but NEITHER now charges with regular wall charger.
