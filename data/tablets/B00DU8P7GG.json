At this point I have not been able to achieve ability to use the Playstore,also I'm having a problem getting Netflix to preform.

Does not use external micro SD for memory expansion.Charger cheaply made and though it looks like a standard micro USB charger it will not work on other devices and vice versa. Looks nice and the stats look great but too many short comings even for $90Most sites think your using a iPad but trust me you will not. They had two postings for the same tablet so please don't think I didn't buy it because I did. The seller's will except returns with little to no problem but as I told them had it just performed as advertised there would be no need.

The follow are observations while setting up and using the AGPTEX tablet for less than a week.first the good:\u2022 Low cost\u2022 Quad code processor (very Fast)\u2022 Stable platform with latest operating Android system.\u2022 Plays Movies, including Netflix without any performance issues.\u2022 Connecting  to a external USB memory with the supplied OTG cable was a no brainerNow the not so good:\u2022 No Bluetooth. You will need to plug-in ear phones in for audio and movies for better sound\u2022 The G sensor (gyro) is very basic and has no Auto rotate\u2022 No GPS: If you use your table for travel, you will want the GPS to identify your current location for local information.\u2022 No near field function.\u2022 No rear camera.\u2022 Forward camera (this is the one facing you) is dark and no so good of qualityI was not impressed by the video quality when connected to a HDMI TV with a 10ft HDMI. Netflix was grainy, but I was on a slow connection so, It may be better when connected over a faster network.I used the Wattpad application to check out the tablet as an E book reader. It performed as good as any more expensive tablet.Final Note: Compared to the $200 Nexus 7 tablet I miss the Blue tooth and GPS function that is missing from the AGPTEX. However, having all the software and rooted  for adding external memory for storing video's and music is a big plus for the $80 AQGPTEX tablet. The AGPTEX also has HDMI output that the Nexus 7 does not.", "Date": "January 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "AMAZING", "Author": "Jake", "ReviewID": "R3G8ABZ8V35KYQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had the tablet for a couple hours now.

Though at first it appears to have navigation/GPS  abilities when using the Google maps/nav App. I found it didn't.  Upon further inspection of the item description/manual etc, there is no mention of including GPS capability. A slight bummer as this Tablet actually has a decent looking picture and, though not the fasted tablet I've played on, it generally performs at reasonable speeds. Netflix works well enough and the internet browsing is quick and works well when connect to high speed wifi.  For a tablet under $90 its a nice affordable media and internet browsing tablet. It is definitely a good back up secondary tablet.  I haven't had it long enough to say anything about its longevity or durability, but i'm happy with it so far.", "Date": "October 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Tablet", "Author": "Amazing Seller \"Jewelry Designer Lover\"", "ReviewID": "RUZCXAQO9ZCQ6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The AGPtek Android tablet is a great tablet.
