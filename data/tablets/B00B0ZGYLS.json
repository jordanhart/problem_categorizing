{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Okay for what it is...", "Author": "Dej", "ReviewID": "R2E1EOXVDOLSW9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It's put out by Mach Speed, and has a resistive touch screen. Operating system is Ice Cream Sandwich. Built-in memory is 4GB, expandable to 32GB with a Micro SD Card. You might have about 2GB usable storage once you subtract the OS from the original 4GB memory. Processor is supposed to be 1.2 GHz with 512MB DDR3 (check it, because mine didn't match). The battery charge lasts up to around 6 hours depending on what you're doing, and it charges quickly with either a wall charger or a usb cable - both are included. It looks and feels like it's all plastic, and is a dust and fingerprint magnet.That said, it actually works pretty well once you calibrate the touch screen. I had to run the calibration 4 times before it was responsive enough to be really usable. If you're used to a resistive screen you won't have a problem, but if you're used to a capacitive touch screen you'll feel like you've stepped back in time.It doesn't have the Google Play Store. I've installed the Amazon App Store. It plays videos well, and works good as an e-book reader. You can read library books through Overdrive, epubs and Kindle. You can, also, play YouTube videos. I've played word games on it, but you might have a problem if you want to play games that require a lot of finger and screen movements. The built-in speakers aren't very loud, headphones are a little better.I was actually looking for a color e-reader and found this tablet for less. I didn't pay the list price, and wouldn't. You can get a better tablet with a capacitive screen for the list price. Overall, I'm enjoying it for what it is, but I don't really recommend it.", "Date": "April 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "GREAT as a second tablet for reading and games, especially for travel", "Author": "Magistra", "ReviewID": "R27YJZKSJ14YQP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So far, so good: bought this baby tablet as an alternative to travelling with a laptop when I know there will be wifi access and as an alternative to cranky kids when sharing isn't working.  The setup was really simple,  and the apps available from Amazon,  google play and other sources have been entertaining and informative-  so far a dozen games and twice as many e-books.  Email is pretty darn slow but web surfing isn't too bad.  Haven't used the music player yet but kids report YouTube (etc) viewing is fine. Touch screen needs a harder tap than on my Galaxy tablet, with a stylus or capped pen,  but at about 20% of the cost I'm not quibbling.  With a backup external battery pack it should be great for plane trips, and I've found a few map apps that should help keep me from getting lost. .  .much. . . If you're looking for a more powerful machine,  this isn't it,  and it does feel rather toy-like.

We're an ipad/ipod family, so this took some getting used to. It works, but I'm glad I didn't spend very much on it because the screen is not very sensitive and we often have to touch on things multiple times before the tablet reacts. I didn't realize that I wasn't going to easily be able to sync my outlook calendar w/this like I do on my ipad, so I ended up moving my family calendar to google calendar. We basically use this tablet to check the calendar, but we use our other devices to add events since the screen reaction time is frustrating.", "Date": "June 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great item for the price!", "Author": "cami1969", "ReviewID": "R3PZ9DYK8YE4H1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's a little slow but it's a great tablet for the price.

I got it for my husband to use basically as a backup so he can carry it around without being out much money if it gets broken or stolen. For that purpose it works fine. He can play games and read.
