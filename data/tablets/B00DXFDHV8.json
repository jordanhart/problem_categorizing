{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not Quite Perfect, But Close", "Author": "Philip R. Heath \"Gadgets, Music, & Books\"", "ReviewID": "RJW7LIL0B39F6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Good:+ Extra Smooth, Fast Navigation+ Video Playback+ Music Playback+ Games+ Good Browser Experience+ Long Battery Life+ Micro-USB Charging Port (Finally!)+ Intel Processor+ Priced Right+ Plenty of Case OptionsThe Bad:- Lots of Bloatware- Feels CheapOverall:  The materials might feel cheap, but ASUS gets the rest of the table experience right this time.Design:  I guess to get the rest of the experience at this price, ASUS had to compromise on design materials.  The back casing of the ASUS MeMO Pad FHD 10 makes most netbooks feel like they were made of prime materials by comparison.  There's no way to sugar coat it.  The MeMO Pad feels like a toy compared to the brushed aluminum on the Transformer Pad Infinity.  It is also not the thinnest or lightest tablet compared to the likes of the Sony Xperia Z.  However, this is where my gripes essentially end with the MeMO Pad.Setup:  The instructions recommended a minimum of 8 hours charging, and I dropped mine on the charger and left it overnight.  This is a bit of a buzzkill for the excitement of a new tablet, but it is worth it.  You will benefit in long-term battery performance over the life of the tablet.  Other than that, ASUS has an easy to follow guided process that even first time users will be able to follow without issue.  There was a firmware update available, and I installed it before proceeding.  From this point forward, I experience boot-up times of about 35-40 seconds.  It's not the fastest, but it is vastly better than the Transformer Pad Infinity.Video Playback:  This is the punch line for a \"Full HD\" tablet, right?  Well, ASUS did a great job.  I fed the MeMO Pad some eye candy in the form of Thor and Beowulf from Netflix.  I have always thought that the throne room scene at the beginning of Thor was striking, and the colors were as rich as ever.  Beowulf is a relatively new entrant on Netflix, but it came through in all its glory as well.  One other Netflix improvement is in the actual navigation of the app itself.  Every other tablet I've used (Acer Iconia A100, ASUS Transformer Pad Infinity, and Sony Xperia Z) had poor, choppy navigation when scrolling through movies.  I am very pleased to say that this is not the case on the MeMO Pad.  Perhaps it is the new Intel chip that makes the difference.  This starts a trend of performance over design.Music Playback:  While it is definitely bigger than your phone (or dedicated mp3 player), the target use for the MeMO Pad is still with headphones.  The speakers are sufficient for watching video or playing games, but they lack the bass required to provide an enjoyable, balanced music listening session.  However, I used both my Monster Diesel Vektr (corded) and Plantronics BackBeat Go 2 (Bluetooth) headphones, and the experience is quite good.  If for some reason you don't already have a device to play mp3s, this will get the job done.  The Play Music app is the default for local music play, and both it and the Amazon MP3 apps can play from the cloud.Gaming:  Call me old school, but I love pinball.  I have been a fan of Zen Pinball since it came on my Acer tablet a couple of years ago.  The HD screen makes tables such as The Avengers pop visually, but the gameplay was smoother than I have experienced on my other tablets.  There was never a hitch or a jerk in the display.  While this is far from the most taxing game out there, I noticed a surprising improvement over the Transformer Pad Infinity.  The performance over design trend continues.Navigation:  I mentioned this earlier about Netflix, but the smooth navigation carries over into all aspects of the MeMO Pad.  Both the app tray and Chrome are snappy and smooth.  In the past, I have always been a bit envious of iPad owners because everything flowed so effortlessly.  This tablet is the first Android offering that has performed in the same zip code as the iPad.  I don't know how to account for it with certainty, but I do know that this is the first tablet I've had with the new Intel Clover Trail+ chip.  Whatever the cause, it's about time!Other:  The battery life on the MeMO Pad is as advertised.  The first charge lasted for three days of intermittent use.  ASUS finally went away from the proprietary charging port to micro-USB.  It is so nice not to have to worry about carrying around my one and only charger for my tablet.  It will just work with the one myriad of micro-USB chargers I have at home, work, in the car, etc.  You might accuse me of burying the lead on this, but all this goodness comes at a substantial discount over the Transformer Pad Infinity prices.  The only thing the Infinity has over the MeMO is the brushed aluminum case.  (All apologies to the \"Dock\" owners, but that is a component destined for failure from stress/wear and tear.)Complaints:  The list is pretty short.  I've already mentioned the cheap feel of the back panel.  The other thing that I don't like is common to most tablets - lots of bloatware.  Perhaps I am the outlier on this, but I just can't imagine that users are chomping at the bit to use the one off ASUS apps over things that are more generally available.  The only way to avoid them is to go with a \"pure Android\" device from Google, and I guess I can't be too harsh.  Since Android 4.0, you can disable and hide unwanted apps.  I just wish the tablet and computer makers would stop it.Conclusion:  Although I wish it had nicer material for the back panel, I can't take exception with much else about this tablet from ASUS.  Whatever it is that they've changed since the \"Transformer\" line; it works.  This tablet is strong to quite strong.  You get your money's worth, and I highly recommend it.", "Date": "September 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great and Economical Tablet - Click Video to See", "Author": "A Gamer at Heart", "ReviewID":

My tablet usage scenario involves a lot of browsing, book reading, some movie watching and very light gaming.After some research I bought Asus Memo Pad FHD 10.It is a 10\" tablet wiht 1920x1200 resolution which puts is above Galaxy Tab 3 and most of the tablets that feature 1280x800,on par with Sony Xperia Tablet Z and below Google(Samsung) Nexus 10 and Apple iPad.Please note, that while Sony Xperia Tablet Z has the same resoluton, the Sony screen is brighter and the color space is closer to RGB than on Memo Pad.Memo Pad FHD 10 runs Intel z2560 CPU based on x86 architecture while all other tablets use ARM architecture CPU.This implies that is really difficult to compare the performance, since some operations are faster and other opeations are slower than in ARM based CPUs.For example, the MemoPad Antutu test results are better than Nexus 10, the Sun spyder tests results  are better than on Sony Xperia Tablet Z, whilethe Geekbench puts Asus Memopad below last year Tegra3.Also, some application that use native ARM code or mixed code may have problems with this product.Even if Intel handles the code translation with the magic libhoudini.so, the translation is not perfect and may affect the performance and stability.Fortunately, it happens with very few applications.Why I chose Asus Memo Pad over Ipad 4:- I decided to switch from Apple to Android ecosystem.- Ipad has just 1Gb of RAM. My fear is that in 2 years the retina resolution Ipad4 will crash with 1Gbas my current Ipad one constantly crashes with 256Mb of RAM. (The crashes started after IOS upgrades, and I can't downgrade the OS version)- Ipad 4 is more expensiveWhy I chose Asus Memo Pad over Sony Tablet Z:- All reviews point that the battery life is lowest among  the competitors.- My everyday use scenario involves  a lot of browsing and Tablet Z scores pretty low on browser related tests.- According some message boards and reviews, Tablet Z runs hotter (> 100F) even in simple scenarios.- TabletZ is ~$150 more expensive.- The TabletZ beauty and lightweight design will not be appreciated with a case or cover.Why I chose Asus Memo Pad over Nexus 10:- Nexus 10 doesn't have microSD slot, so the 32Gb version is mandatory, this makes Nexus 10 ~$80 more expensive (as of today).and still I have my storage space limited.- While 2Gbs are enough for 1920x1200, there are some reports of crashes due to not enough memory in Nexus 10.- I don't like Nexus 10 design.- According some message boards and reviews, the Nexus 10 tends to heat up considerably in some circumstances.Also there are some complains about random freezes and reboots.What you should choose:If you're happy with Apple ecosystem, don't want to spend time learning android, and don't mind paying few $$$ more - get an Ipad.If you want the best colors, best design or you plan to use your tablet outdoors - check the Sony Tablet Xperia ZIf you need the highest resolution, but by some reason don't like the IPad - Nexus 10 is your choice.I expect that in few months new models will be released making this review partially obsolete.", "Date": "September 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "be careful, some apps are not compatible", "Author": "melonboy123", "ReviewID": "R3HLZ606IND5WH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a good tablet, well designed and is very fast.

I like the custom user interface on this tablet so much, I don't even feel the need to install a different ROM.  While it doesn't have all of the features of CyanogenMod, it does have a bunch of unique features that other ROMs do not.=== Look and Feel ===I had an HP TouchPad that I installed Android 4.2 on, and this tablet blows it away.  The screen is bright and the resolution is high.  Text is easy to read, and images and video look terrific.  It is light and easy to hold, although I decided to use a case (the VSTN Multi-Stand PU Leather Cover Case with Hand Strap and Card Holder).  The tablet even responds to the cover by sleeping when the cover is closed and waking up when the cover opens.  The images and video from the camera look great.=== The User Interface ===There is an extra button on the bottom of the screen that pops up a menu with a number of mini-apps that each open in their own draggable window.  Each works like a standard window that can remain visible while other apps are being viewed.  These mini-apps include:- Calculator- Audio Wizard (for selecting presets like Music, Movie, Gaming, Speech, and Recording)- A full dictionary, allowing you to look up words and show their definitions, listen to an audio example of how to pronounce the word, and a link to search for it on Wikipedia.- A video player- A complete unit converter, like for converting inches to millimeters- A simple countdown clock- A stopwatch- A compass- A mini-browser- A mini-calendar and e-mail window that links to your existing calendar and e-mail accounts- BuddyBuzz, a mini-window that you can link to your social media accounts withThe notification drawer that pulls down at the top of the screen has a bunch of controls in it.  From left to right:- On/Off for Wi-Fi, Power SmartSaving, Instant Dictionary (see below), Bluetooth, GPS, Sound.- A slider for brightness (with a toggle for auto-brightness)- A shortcut to Wi-Fi settings, sound settings (more on this later), wireless display settings (Miracast), and general settings.- The standard Android notifications.=== ASUS Apps ===I was surprised at the number and quality of some of the ASUS apps that come pre-installed.  These include:- AOLink, a media browser that can access your DLNA devices and your own ASUS cloud storage.- App Backup and App Locker- ASUS Artist, a fun little painting program with a variety of pens, airbrushes, backgrounds, etc.- ASUS Splendid, a tool for calibarting the colors on your tablet- ASUS Studio, a photo album organizer- ASUS To-Do, a task manager that also links to your Google account- AudioWizard (previously mentioned)- BuddyBuzz (previously mentioned)- Dictionary- My BitCast - a tool for organizing notes and photos using an ASUS cloud account- My Library, an e-reader- Parental Lock - a parental control app- People, a contact manager that links to your Google account- PowerSaver, a tool for automatically conserving energy which is customizable- Story, a simple storyboard editor that allows you to add photos, maps, and text and then share the image using a number of tools or your e-mail- SuperNote Lite, a tool for editing mini notepads including text, images, and even your handwriting.=== Summary ===I highly recommend this tablet.

Has all you ever need in a compact computer tablet.  Comes with basics charger and instructions.  Before use, it is good idea to put a screen protector on it.  Came with enough charge to set up. It gave the prompts and took about 15 minutes to do my set ups.  I then charged 5 hours and was ready to go.I love that this is a 16GB Tablet which is big enough to hold lots of information, and makes a nice little computer for every day use.  It easy to sync to all my other devices and get my information. I signed into my email accounts and have icon, that I can now touch and go directly to the emails.Touch Screen; 10.1\"  WUXGA (19201200):  Screen  is actually 8 1/2 \" X 5 1/2\"  viewing area, as it has a 1\" boarder all around.

It will take a photo from the back camera , or touch the flip on screen it can be in mirror and take a pic of you.  This is really handy. It has built in mic also,  so if you want to do face to face video call on this tablet computer like with skype you can, or use video camera funciton to make movies.Love the note pad function. It is so easy to make my grocery / shopping list or any list for that matter.  You can write with your finger. Great for reminders.  My daughter got me a 2\" soft end static pin in bubble gum machine at grocery store that hooks in the earphone jack. It works great on the touch screen, when I do not want to use my finger.Remember to add virus software, I choose the Avast for mobile devices and it recognized the tablet immediately. I downloaded the free Avast, and went on to choose the free avast storage back up, so that I can have my photos backed up for free, as a complement to the Asus backup.Pre Installed appsAmazon kindle Aolink App back up webstorage App locker  ASUS Artist  ASUSsplendid ASUS Studio  ASUS to-do  Audio Wizard Browser  Buddy Buzz Calculator  Calendar Camera  Chrome  Clock  Dictionary  Downloads  Email  File Manager  Gallery  Gmail  Google Google settings  Google+  Instant dictionary  Local  local maps  Messenger  Movie studio  MybitCast  My Library  Navigation  Parental Lock  People  Play books  Play Magazine  Play Movies & TV  Play Music  Play store  Power saver  press reader  settings  setup wizard  Sound Recorder  story  superNote Lite  talk  voice Search  webstore  You Tube  ZinoEasy to download apps.

I've owned Tab 3's,  Nexus-7 2013, Note 8.0.. they just don't match up.. FORGET Synthetic Benchmarks.. Don't let websites suck you in with numbers.. this Tablet kicks ass. Run either Nova or Holo launcher which allows you to speed up transitions if you need to make the Tablet seem snappier..HDMI Out works flawlessly and allows you to keep continuous charge supplied to the Tablet while viewing the Tablet on your Big Screen T.V. 1920 x 1200 is true HD Resolution and the Tablet is Razor Sharp.. I suggest you download Dolphin Browser from the playstore it runs MUCH smoother than Chrome..(Don't know why year after year Google's own Browser still stutters)The weight is average for this class of Tablet the rear is really grippy and feels nice even holding it for long periods.Asus is good with updates so I fully expect this this Tablet to get upgraded to Android 4.3 and possibly Android 4.4 early next year.. Please don't even consider the 3 Rating Review.. That is someone that is upset there are not Custom ROM's available..

G. boyd", "ReviewID": "RWX7FCNOVH5IM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was eager to purchase a new tablet before a long vacation. Traditionally I tote my laptop and after some consideration I realized a large tablet would suit my needs and be much more portable. I had my eye on the predecessor to this model which was inferior related to the resolution. I also didn't feel like shelling out big bucks for a new iPad; so for me, the middle ground of a mid-priced tablet with good specs on paper fit the bill.  It arrived in a couple days, just before my trip, so I promptly hit the GooglePlay store and loaded it up.Battery LifeDuring a 12 hour flight I was able to watch four movies back to back. I played some dots, listened to music and read content that I had saved prior.  While USB outlets were available on the plane, I didn't need to plug in.  I arrived with 30-something percent left. IMHO battery life is excellent.DisplayI read that some folks didn't like the display due to it not being as \"bright\" as iPad retina and the Nexus 10.  Well, honestly, I keep the brightness on this somewhere between 25 and 50 percent and it's absolutely great.  It's very vivid and cris-pity clear.  Again, even though I was looking to be critical, it's impossible.  This tablet display is very very nice.OverallSince my trip, I read and monitor Twitter nightly during the prime time shows I watch and enjoy the easy use. I'm always using it browse the web and relegated my laptop to the desk for tasks like Photoshop only! The FHD 10 is very lightweight and easy to hold. The sound is GREAT when watching youtube video or listening to music.  I have not tried Chromecast yet, but that's on my list.  Streaming video is smooth and error-free,  Web browsing gave me some concern initially because Chrome was soooo very laggy.  However after an update to Chrome, the experience is fantastic.  I am very very happy with my purchase.  The MeMO FHD 10 is fast, lightweight and looks great.  I have had zero issues with it and prefer the GooglePlay experience more than my iPhone and iTunes experience related to ease of use and content.  I'm not a \"gamer\" so I can't comment on that... but so far all my apps, social media stuff and web surfing are fantastic.I'm happy to answer questions etc if you have any prior to purchasing.", "Date": "October 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent tablet", "Author": "Dave", "ReviewID": "RA3TD8KRC55O5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I did a lot of research and flip-flopping before deciding on this tablet.  I wish that I hadn't, because I love it!The Good:The screen is nice and crisp.  I hear complaints about brightness, but I have no issues with it.  The auto brightness can be a little strange, but other than that it is fine.  The images look good and the color is not over saturated.  The size is great.  Another complaint I see is that there is too much bezel.  I have no issue with this either, as it lets me hold the tablet with my fingers getting in the way of what I am actually trying to see.The price is AWESOME.  I looked and looked for other tablets.  I could find used tablets for decent price, but wasn't so sure.  I have seen a couple of refurbs that might have been nice, but I just couldn't pull the trigger.  Getting a brand new device with a warranty makes me feel a lot better.  For the price you get a great deal here!  For a 10 inch tablet at this resolution you're usually spending much more.The keyboard.  I know it sounds weird, but I love this keyboard.  This has sold me on the typing experience.  This is an Asus keyboard, it differs slightly from the Android stock keyboard.  Providing the row with numbers is a boon and the layout is actually quite nice when you're using @'s and .com's.The speakers sound very nice.  When I saw videos or read reviews I kind of blew it off.  After using them, I am kind of impressed.  Don't get me wrong, you aren't throwing out your sound system and replacing it with this, but these are some of the best sounding tablet speakers I've heard.  They weren't super tinny and the mid range wasn't muddy and gross.  Not a lot of deep bass response, but I didn't expect much.  I was please with how it handled by old school gangster rap (NWA and Ice Cube) as well as 90's hard rock (Alice in Chains and White Zombie).The performance is actually much better than I anticipated.  Most of the reviews of this tablet pit it against some of the best tablets out there, which may not really be fair.  A lot of the reviews also use benchmarks that I'm not entirely sure can make full use of the Intel CPU powering this beast.  I have yet to see a real stutter on the device.  I have noticed a hiccup here or there when downloading or installing a lot of stuff at once while I was loading it up, but nothing else slows it down.  I've played a handful of games, browsed web pages and and scrolled through the screens countless times now.  The web browsing experience is actually remarkably smooth.  It is lightning fast and I was kind of shocked by it's responsiveness.  Web browsing is one of the things that this tablet does best, honestly.  With the speed at which it tears through the internet supported by the gorgeous screen and it's size and resolution... how can this not be a win?The Bad:The battery life has been kind of on the crappy side.  I understand that I am hammering away at this thing, but when I sit it down at night I expect that when I pick it up that it shouldn't have drained 20% while I was asleep.  Granted, there may be one of the apps that I've installed causing the issue, it is still frustrating.  I am sure that once I regulate my usage that the battery life will get even better.  I fooled with it nearly 12 hours today off and on and move it from 79% to 23?% before I tossed it on the charger.  The charger that comes with it, btw, seems to do the best job charging it.  Even a Note 2 charger wasn't pumping out the juice to move this badboy today.I am still skeptical about the support that this Intel CPU is going to get.  There is no real mod community and no one is developing ROMs for this device.  The method for rooting it is very limited.  While I've only run into one application that won't run on this tablet, I assume there are others.  I want Intel to do well in this space, though.  Since the developing community doesn't see a lot of interest, I wonder what I can expect in terms of updates from ASUS.  With a 4.4 release coming any day now, I would like the security of knowing that I can take advantage of some of these features.  If I can't get it from Cyanogen, I'd like to hope that waiting a little bit extra could score me an update from the manufacturer.Overall:This tablet kills it!  As long as you go in understanding that this IS NOT a top tier Android tablet.  It isn't going to be the fastest super tablet ever.  This is a capable tablet with a good looking screen that comes in a nice size that is insanely affordable.  I think this tablet is better than the top tier of last year in a lot of ways, but won't be competing with the brand new top end tablets of this year.  I got this to watch YouTube videos with my young son while we cuddle on the couch, to watch some Netflix when I don't wanna be in front of the TV, and to play Hearthstone when I'm supposed to be working (via Splashtop).  This tablet does all of that and more.I wish there were more actual accessories for this tablet.  Finding actual stuff for it or to fit it is no easy task.  For the price, though, I can't complain.  Most tablets exist as a niche.", "Date": "October 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "good ipad alternative, especially considering cost difference.", "Author": "mike gallagher", "ReviewID": "R3966WEPI30JD5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this after reluctantly giving up my ipad3. I was thinking about getting the new iPad but then I started seeing pricing for the 64GB versions (of even the iPad mini), OUTRAGEOUS. I have a ton of music and movies, which this screws people like me as a 'power user' so Apple really sticks it to you for the extra memory (which honestly, is really cheap). Even @64GB, I had less than 10GB left! It is not cool at all that for a small amount of memory (cost wise) that they stick it to you so hard for 64GB and I think the new 128GB will be completely out of this park expensive. Anyways, the cost was almost triple the cost of this unit. My major requirements was at least 64GB and something running at least the latest version of android OS (I've used Jellybean on multiple cell phones and it's pretty cool).  I had given a droid tablet a try before I got my iPad 3 and was not impressed (motorola brand) and returned to store, that did feel cheap. This time, with Jelly Bean shipping on the unit, it's not the same, not even close to same experience. If, like me, you're not happy with the IOS 7 changes, this is a good time to give android a shot (even if you have before). This unit is great, I disagree that the device feels cheap, it doesn't at all. The sound is really good for a tablet device as is the touchscreen. I did find issues with the light sensor to be a bit crazy like others had noted, but that's easy to disable and manually manipulate. Usually with tablets you're not moving like you are with a cell phone. The colors and brightness of the lcd, no complaints here. The only slight issue I saw was the onscreen keyboard is not the best but I'll survive to save as much as I did getting this unit. Here's my favorite part, this device supports microsd cards up to at least 64GB, so now my tablet isn't 64GB, it's **96GB***. I took my itunes directory and put it on a microsd card and plug it in, bam, done now my entire library is moved. Overall, I think this is a great tablet that you should consider prior to spend 2-3times for apple products.", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "A great Android tablet and iPad Retina alternative", "Author": "Jerry Jackson Jr.", "ReviewID": "R25IJ5CU2TQODS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The ASUS MeMo Pad 10 FHD is a fantastic Android tablet for those who want something similar to the iPad with Retina display but running Android instead. The screen isn't quite as bright as the latest iPad with the brightness turned all the way up (so it might be very difficult to see the screen under direct sunlight) and the screen on my ASUS MeMo Pad 10 FHD needed to be adjusted using the included app that lets you increase the color saturation. However, this IPS display has GREAT viewing angles and has essentially the same image quality as the iPad.The Memo Pad FHD also has a microSD card slot so you can add additional storage to your tablet ... something the iPad and most alternative Android tablets don't have.The performance of the Intel processor and graphics are \"class leading\" but I never had any problems or significant lag when viewing websites, video, playing games, running productivity apps for work or editing photos on this tablet.I will say that the tablet is a little bigger than some other 10-inch tablets (like the iPad) because of the screen ratio so it barely fits inside some \"universal\" tablet cases designed for 10-inch tablets.I found that the battery life varies dramatically depending on the apps you're running. I get 8 to 10 hours of battery life with this tablet when I'm mostly just browsing websites and watching a couple of short video clips on YouTube. If I play a bunch of games that have to connect with servers (because they're multiplayer games) then the battery life might only be 4+ hours before I get the alert message that I need to plug in the charger.In short, I would highly recommend this tablet to anyone who is looking for an Android tablet with a great screen and good features.

The price point is intriguing for a widescreen 10.1 inch tablet. It uses an uncommon processor and although I like Asus laptops for value, their tablets were unknown to me.After using and more importantly enjoying this tablet, I am impressed and it is worthy for consideration for an Android tablet. It does have a few limits. The screen is very good but not great. I do have an iPad 3 and I felt it was just a tad less high def. And the pixel density does bear that out, it is 240. BUT there is plenty to like about the screen: very accurate colors and good color depth. It is a very good screen especially at the price. But not great.Performance: Very quick web surfing, very quick download and install of apps. Video apps: not as responsive as web surfing but still very enjoyable. Netflix, Watch ESPN, HBO Go all work well. But there are times when video seems to go down in quality which happens rarely with my iPad across the same exact wireless network. Games: good performance, and the screen is a little better with games than video.Speakers: very good tablet speakers and very good speaker control. There is an easily accessible speaker interface with different speaker modes, music, movie, talking, etc. These modes matter. Movie mode works great for videos and music for, well, music. While the volume isn't exceptional it is more than good enough and no distortion even at full volume. Much better speakers than the iPad.Build: VERY impressed. The MeMO pad feels good. In fact the textured back feels so good in the hand I really can't recommend getting a cover. It is that good. It is also lightweight for the size. I didn't think .2 of a lb or so can make a difference, it does. The MeMO is a pleasure to hold for long periods and use.Interface: I like it. You swipe downward from any screen and it brings up a lot of useful controls. You can build folders and various screens can have different functions and layouts. Unfortunately this is hard to learn about (more later). There are a number of Asus apps from drawing, to video production, to backup, etc.Good virtual keyboard, responsive and accurate.Camera: I don't use tablets for video or pictures. But I tried it out and the back camera takes decent pictures and video. If this is something you do you will not be disappointed.Cons: Although I like screen I am going to also put it on the con. The screen is the heart of any tablet to me. Tablets are visual machines. It is a very good screen. But if the Fire HDX lives up to its spec...that has to be a consideration. Video playback on various apps seems to degrade at times more than my iPad.Summary: Wow. Very few compromises, especially considering the price. This is an excellent value. Speaking of value, the 32GB is an absolute no brainer at $20 more. You get about 11.5 usable gigs with the 16GB. Micro SD is nice of course but good to have more system storage. If you want an Android tablet that does everything well, is pretty fast, and has an enjoyable if not top of the line screen, for a very competitive price, you should consider the MeMO pad. It really shows how overpriced iPads are, especially the non-retina mini which was and is a complete rip-off. Competition is paying off in the Android tablet market, there is a lot of value to be had, and the MeMO 10 is definitely value laden.", "Date": "September 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "Sandra Hamilton \"shamiltonky\"", "ReviewID": "R49J8OGHPKY2X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After doing some extensive research, I decided to purchase the Asus Memo.

I've used the original iPad, the iPad 2, and right now I have an iPad Mini. I've had the Mini for nearly a year and had nearly forgotten the pros and cons of a bigger device.This tablet looks and feels nice. It is a little larger than the standard iPad and lighter than the old iPads, but heavier than the iPad Airs. It is designed to be mostly used in landscape mode (since that is where the cameras are placed). The large screen is really nice for web browsing, since lots of websites don't optimize for tablets.I liked how smooth the touch response was on this device. It is seems as good as my iPad (I have tried other touch devices and none have matched up to the iPad yet for smoothness). There are only two buttons on the tablet, the power and sound buttons. Then there are 4 digital buttons; a button for a dock, a back button, home button, and all running apps view. Audio is nice and clear and the volume goes up pretty loud. The screen colors are nice and vibrant. Battery has been great so far.I tried comparing the Mini to this tablet in the web browser for speed and appearance. The Mini constantly loaded pages quicker, especially if they had lots of images. But once they were loaded there wasn't any difference between the devices.The cameras appear to be the same (ran a comparison, but also checked specs and they are both 5MP).This tablet runs Android Jellybean, which is currently one version behind. I am not going to try and compare Android vs iOS other than to say that they both have their pros and cons. I prefer the iOS, but I enjoy playing with Android.I spent a very short time once playing with a Samsung Galaxy, which was pretty awful.

Apple is one of my favs, I still rock the iPod Nano Gen 3, I gave my iPod touch to my son when I bought the Galaxy S3.  Anyway to the point, this has to be one of my favorite toys.  The CPU is snappy and responsive.  The internet access is so easy to set up and not have to worry about when going from place to place, as it automatically signs you into the nearest remembered network seamlessly.

I will say, though, that it's been excellent for my needs.  There are quite a few apps available for it--including a free suite of tools that are somewhat similar to MSOffice, but work with Android--that I use regularly.  I've got a lot of books in PDF format  (most free!) stored on my tablet, so I always have a reading library with me.  This tablet is far superior for that function, alone, than my Nook was ... and at about the same price ... but this does SOOO much more!While I didn't get this for the camera feature, the camera does a pretty good job in normal lighting conditions.  The display graphics are excellent.  I don't use it for games, but it's great for things like streaming media.  I learned a lesson many years ago, and bought the model of this tablet with the most internal memory, then added a large-capacity external SD card to it.  It's always good to have lots of storage space when using a camera, videos, and lots of large PDF files.One thing that came along right after I bought this was Google's \"Chromecast\" dongle for use as an interface between Internet services available on my WiFi network and my television.  This tablet works exceptionally well with that, acting sort of like a remote control unit for Netflix, Hulu, etc.  It won't stream anything directly from the tablet to the TV yet (Android doesn't support \"tab casting\" yet), but hopefully that's in the near future.  In the meantime, I can attach the tablet to my TV via an HDMI cable made to fit both units.  That works very well ... but there's still a cable between the two, even though I found one online that's thin, flexible, and long.One other very nice (and cheap) accessory that I got for it was a cable that allows me to attach USB thumb drives to the tablet via the micro USB port.  I ordered a couple of these through an online site for a couple of bucks each.  They work very well, so I can carry additional content with me without having to transfer it to the tablet (but I could, if I wanted to, using the file manager).  I haven't seen anyone promoting this option, but they should.  We all have USB drives lying around, and it's a convenient way to transport data.When I first bought the MeMO Pad, I thought that I needed to have a case with a keyboard, so I bought a universal-style case with a bluetooth keyboard.  The keyboard works fine, but I find that I seldom use it.  The case was unsatisfactory because it's clunky and it was hard to get to buttons and ports on the pad.  I bought a second case--one made just for this tablet, but without a keyboard.  It's excellent ... and much cheaper, and it came with a stylus and a magnetic closing system for the cover.  I still have the keyboard, from the other case, but seldom use it.  It's good to have around, though, when I'm travelling.It's been a learning experience getting used to how tablets work, but there's no huge learning curve with the Asus.  Very little of the usual new-computer frustration comes along with it.  Most stuff is pretty easy to figure out for those of us who don't like watching introduction presentations and reading books.  But for those rare times that there is a specific problem to sort out, Asus has a very good PDF manual online (which I downloaded to the tablet).  Most of my learning has come through exploring and experimenting, and that can be fun.", "Date": "November 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Blown Away! Great Tablet, Hands Down!", "Author": "Natalie Herath", "ReviewID": "R1A8FBCZPNT10B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We have had the Asus Memopad 10.1 for a few days now. We tossed around the idea of which tablet to get for about a month. We traded in our iPad 1 as it could no longer be updated and was way out dated. We used the Amazon trade in program ( which I also recommend) and got an electronic credit toward another Amazon purchase.Before purchasing on amazon I took my husband to a retailer. There he was able to actually hold various tablets in his hands. The 7 and 8 inch tablets were too small for him. He of course picks up a 500 dollar tablet and starts to fall in love with it. I am cringing because all he does is web browse, play casino games, check Facebook and email. There is no need for him to have the most expensive tablet. But, where are going to find a 10.1 inch tablet that is affordable??.....yep Asus MemoPad! Perfect.Upon first using the memopad I was shocked at the initial setup. It walks you thru email set up.....easy! It comes pre loaded with all the necessary apps. The home screen is easy to navigate. There is a great note taking app that rivals Evernote, dare I even say it......The camera is fine. The video quality is acceptable for a tablet in this price point. As for all the stuff (bloatware) that is preloaded . . . That is still up for debate. The few that I clicked on seemed interesting and had its own function (card maker, video app, etc..) The 10.1 inch display is crisp, clear and stunning.In closing the MemoPad 10.1 was perfect for our situation! My husband is back to web browsing, Facebooking and sending emails with ease. I find myself always wanting to put my iPad 4s down and grab his MemoPad . . . . Ssshhhhhh don't tell anyone ;) buy it! You will love it! Buy it!

The Android OS is still pretty alien to me, and I'm still knocking around in it, discovering how it works. So it's probably not fair to review the tablet itself based on my own inexperience with the OS. But this tablet is high resolution, easy on the eyes, and amply large. I love that it senses the ambient lighting and adjusts automatically, because my Kindles don't do that and I have to take the brightness up and down manually.One thing I don't like about it is that it does not use Flash so you can't play anything that requires Flash. Any attempts to add Flash give you messages that Google or Adobe have decommissioned Flash and will not use it. I spent several hours nosing around in the forums looking for a solution, and even found some cautions that I could hurt my tablet by trying to install a Flash player, so I didn't do it. Sure, geeks and power users may laugh at this, but I don't want to mess with it. But what this means is that I cannot watch Amazon Prime movies on this tablet, which is a real bummer. In the forums I found discussions about this; it's apparently a problem with Amazon, not anybody else. They have not developed an app to allow playing their instant videos on Android systems. Somebody said they were hoping an app would be out by 2014, but that there was no guarantee; that Amazon is probably trying to protect its Kindle market by not releasing an app. So my normally high estimation of Amazon is knocked down a peg for absence of an app. Hopefully they will rememdy this soon.The first thing I did was order a rooCase for it, but I discovered that the cut-out in the rooCase for the rear-facing camera vignetted photos and videos (imagine a black circle around the edges). So I took the plunge and ordered ASUS Official Folio Keyboard Case for MeMOPad Smart ME301 Series, and that's given me a completely different experience with this tablet. It feels more like my Chromebook, if a little less stable in my lap. I like the soft-touch ON button on the Folio keyboard case because, without it, it's kind of hard to turn on the tablet. There are a few Bluetooth connection issues with the Folio keyboard case, but that's for another review.One thing that is weird to me about this tablet is that you are not supposed to leave it plugged in to the charger. I'm used to leaving my Kindles plugged in overnight, but with the Asus tablet you're only supposed to leave it plugged in for eight hours at most. (And if you get the Folio keyboard case for it, you use the same charger for both, one after the other.) The screen is more responsive to touch than my Kindle Fire, but still there is sometimes a lag that I haven't quite gotten used to yet. I think it's like learning to drive a new car: you just have to get used to the way it handles, and then you can groove right on into it.It is definitely easier on the eyes than a 7\" screen. Again, the auto-adjusting brightness is a major boon. I love that I can pick it up in the middle of the night, read or browse for a while, then close it up in its case (which auto-offs) and go back to sleep. I'm still not sure I'm in love with the whole tablet concept, but Google Voice definitely makes it easier to use it.

There is a case here on Amazon that you can get that comes with a Bluetooth keyboard for $35! You can also get a BLuetooth wireless mouse for it! I personally bought the Fosman Anti-Glare (Matte) Screen Protector for it. It fits perfect! There is a port to add a mico SD card. There is also a front and rear camera. They are both pretty clear and take good pictures. I use Skype a lot to talk with my cousin and I have yet to have a problem with it. Although, you are unable to  do other things while using Skype Video call becase it will shut your video off but you can still see the other person you are talking to in a little box on the screen. You can turn your video back on when you pull up your Skype window.Overall, I am absolutely pleased with my Christmas present! My husband picked the perfect one for me! I can do everything I need to!

Hanna", "ReviewID": "R3EKWPJW17PZIJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using Windows on my computers since the very first versions. My current PC is a  Lenovo Yoga 13, which is a very powerful #Intel2in1 running Windows 8. I've had a number of iPhone versions.I also have a 1st generation Kindle Fire. I would never give up my PC or my smartphone, but I'm glad I got this tablet and I am now a fan of #IntelTablets.I wasn't sure what to expect when I got a tablet running Android and I do not have another Android device to compare. I've had this tablet for almost 2 months now, so I have a fairly good impression of what I can do with it. I I have found out that for most common tasks, I use this tablet as my first choice.Email:  I subscribe to way too many emails, so my inbox fills up quickly. Sometimes I take a quick look at email on my phone, but for real work on my email I prefer to use this tablet or my PC. If I'm not already using my PC, I reach for the tablet. The tablet is light and easier to handle than the Yoga, even though the Yoga is light for a convertible. If you write a lot of long emails, you might want to get out the PC or add a Bluetooth keyboard, but the built in keyboard and word suggestions make it easy to use. Winner:  TabletFacebook:  I use the phone a lot when my tablet isn't handy. But my first choice is the tablet unless I am already on my PC. The Facebook app won't let you adjust font size like you can do on your browser, so if you have bad eyes, you might choose a PC first. However, photos and videos that people share take advantage of the large screen size on the tablet. Winner:  TabletGames:  I don't play many PC games, so I'm talking about the games that you might play on Facebook or through a phone or tablet app. My example here is Candy Crush, but there are loads of games that you could get via Google Play or Amazon that will run fine on this tablet. I haven't ran into any compatibility issues yet. If I want to play Candy Crush on my PC, I have to open Facebook and then open the game. The process is time consuming. Opening the game on the tablet just seems simpler and it automatically takes full advantage of my screen size. Winner:  TabletCamera:  You can see by the specifications that you get a decent camera on this tablet. However, I haven't gotten used to holding up a tablet this large for taking photos. Don't get me wrong, you CAN take great photos and videos with the tablet, but I find myself using my iPhone for photos and videos because it feels better to hold the smaller device in my hands. Winner:  Phone (or a compact camera.)Reading:  My wife and I have a large and growing library of Kindle books. The Kindle app for Android works flawlessly. This tablet's large screen and light weight make it my first choice for reading books. I also have several books on my Olive Tree Bible Study app that I use on my phone and PC. I have been using my PC when I'm doing serious study so I can have multiple applications open, but for reading verses and having study notes open at the same time, the big screen on the tablet is more than adequate. So my favorite reading device is the tablet.Composing documents, making presentations, spreadsheets, and other office tasks. For now nothing beats a PC running Windows. I don't hesitate to boot up the Yoga for the heavy-duty tasks and PC games for Windows. It only takes what feels like 3 seconds to boot up, so time is not an issue. It's just that I like the smaller, lighter tablet best for tasks that a tablet can easily handle.BOTTOM LINE:  I am sold on the capabilities of this tablet and the Android OS for most of my everyday computing.

high as $289.00 so be patient and snag it for under $240.00I did a video review covering the basics but just to sum up:The tablet is super responsive and fastGreat screen resolution 1920 x 1200 (like your LCD TV)Expandable memory with a mini SD slotAwesome sound qualityASUS brand name - they make good laptops alreadyLarger screen then the iPad (9.7\")Light and well constructedExcellent price pointresponsive keyboardvery good cameratouch screen is not over sensitiveBasically like your Smart Phone Jumbo sized ;)The video goes into more detail.

If you don't know how there are some videos that will help you, just Google: \"How do I install Flash Player on my phone?\" It is very easy to do.2.

Had so many issues with that, they replaced and sent a new tablet, same issues. Not to mention no Manufacturer support at all, don't even know who makes that tablet, you only deal with the seller AAA Mart. Returned it, and each time lost $20 in shipping plus the $10 restocking fee. So in total $229 + the $50 in shipping back and forth, so the tablet costed me $280, read my review on that tablet and get the details. before you fall into the trap. Finally came to my senses, and ordered Asus, I am tell you I am so glad I did. The screen quality is amazing, the tablet is fast comes with 2GB of RAM, dual 1.6Ghz Intel. 16GB of internal Storage. It rates very well on Antutu, mine is coming out close to 22,000 points. The best part costed me only $249!!! Amazing deal I have to say and very very good quality. So please do not fall into the trap of cheap Chinese tablets, they are not that cheap if you want good screen, they will also cost you $200-$270. Instead order this or Samsung.Update: 12/11/2013I have had this tablet now for 2 weeks, I absolutely love it. The pic quality is amazing, sound is great. Wifi is fast and i have played all sorts of games on this tablet and it is flawless and fast. I am very impressed by battery life.  Its light weight and durable.  If you can't afford a Galaxy Note or Tab then this is same quality as Galaxy Tab and better in many ways. Still less price, plus Asus keeps its tablet very up to date with all android versions.

I'm not a gamer so I cant really speak to how good it is for that, but I'm sure it's fine. I am not one that has to have the newest electronics out there and so far for me this is perfect. It is half the price of the upper end tablets and as far as I can tell does all the same things. The screen and picture are great.

Those might have had brighter screens or faster processors, but unless they were sitting side by side you would never know the difference.

I also own an iPad 3 and a 2013 Nexus 7 and am favorably impressed by the MeMO Pad. The aspect ratio is more like a wide screen TV than the boring 4:3 of the iPad and the display looks crisp and sharp when streaming movies. The tablet is lightweight and has the usual micro USB port, a micro HDMI port, a headphone jack and a micro SD card slot.  The micro SD card slot is especially welcome since the Nexus 7 lacks that feature entirely.Android 4.2 isn't the newest OS out there, but it's still very recent and is quite similar to the Nexus 7, but adds some Asus specific apps and an icon in the lower left of the screen that pops up some simple apps. The Asus supplied apps seem to work just fine, but I'd like to maintain compatibility with my other android as much as possible, so I'm sticking with the google apps.Battery life seems quite good and the smart sleep feature greatly cuts down on battery drain for times when I forget to plug it in for charging.The back of the tablet is a textured plastic which makes it feel secure when holding it, but you can still see a bit of flex in the body of the tablet when handling it, so I added a case to make it a bit less fragile feeling.I'm very impressed with the MeMO Pad, but am not surprised either. Asus has been building high quality systems, laptops and tablets (including the Nexus 7) for years and their experience shows.Negatives:NonePositives:great screen, speed and battery life. Wifi seems good, but I've not tried it much in extreme cases.

Chrome is also not great compared to the standard browser and boat browser but again easy fix by not using it. Sound is great. Some of the built in apps are nice but others feel like average bloat.

When I got the chance to try out this ASUS MeMO pad, I jumped on it because it's a little bit bigger.  I also have been thinking of getting an iPad, but haven't gotten to that point yet.  This MeMO pad is an Android device.  Pretty much the only thing I am not in love with about this thing is that it is a bit confusing to operate if you are an Apple product user.  I have a MacBook, iPhone, and several other Mac products, all which operate similarly.  This Android thing is cool, but there is an adjustment period that should be taken into consideration if you are coming from an Apple interface.The best thing for me, in comparing this product to the Kindle Fire 7\" is the screen size.  The viewing screen measures 8.5\" x 5.5\", which is quite a bit larger than the viewing screen on my Kindle, which measures 3.75\" x 6\".  Sure I like my Kindle because it is very handy to carry around, so I wouldn't trade that in for this, I love this in addition to my Kindle.  This MeMO pad is just  a great addition to my family because of how we use it.  My nine year old daughter reads online comics that I subscribe to for her every morning at breakfast.  ([...]  Before this pad, she would use my Macbook and I would flip out when she got food all over my keyboard, mousepad, etc.  Now that we have this bigger tablet, she can read her comics on it.  I bought a case that came with a stylus to go with the pad, so it's all decked out.  I was surprised to see so many cases on the market for it, since it seems there are about a thousand different tablets on the market right now.  Oh by the way, this MeMO pad comes with a black plastic easel-type thing that lets you prop up the tablet and read it easily.  I didn't see it until after I ordered my case, because it matched the black plastic packing material inside of the box.I am not going to give you a super-techie review, but an \"everyday person's review\".  The tablet itself has great sound, and very vibrant screen color.  Ear buds are not included with the tablet.  I haven't watched Netflix on it, so I can't comment about watching movies or television shows on it, but I think it would be great.  I downloaded the Amazon Kindle app on it, and it is an awesome way to read the books I have purchased for myself and my kids.  We are not all fighting for the Kindle Fire 7\", now we have options!  One thing ASUS could improve upon is the charger.  The cord is just under 3 feet long, which is not very long at all.  I would prefer at least a 4' cord.  And the plug ends don't fold down into the end of the plug box like the Kindle charger, it just sticks out.  At least this is a generic micro USB charger, so I have plenty of other options lying around my house that are longer.", "Date": "October 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very happy so far.", "Author": "J. S. King", "ReviewID": "R2IZNP1GQI6D41", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this tablet for about 3 weeks now and still finding new things each day.  So far, nothing I wasn't warned about and nothing that makes me feel shorted.  I'm finding it to be a good tablet at a fantastic price.  In my book, that makes it an excellent value.  Don't know how many of the negative comments were due to receiving a bad unit, being overly critical or not knowing how to operate the unit.  Here is my take on some of the issues that other reviewers found objectionable:No user manual included:  Couldn't believe some people had trouble finding a manual on line, but actually, if you go to the app called My Library (some referred to as \"bloatware\"), there is a copy of the complete user manual, Alice in Wonderland and Pride and Prejudice.Bloatware:  I'll concede that an app called Mirror that simply turns on the front facing camera and nothing else has limited usefulness, but how much memory is that actually using?  According to the internal storage summary, there is just over 11GB of internal memory available.  All of the \"bloatware\" takes up 242MB, and at least I found much of that to be at least somewhat useful.Battery life:  My experience was that after the initial 8 hour charge, I got about 7.5 hours of use with 10% power remaining.  There are two standard power saving settings and one that can be customized for your use, so I believe that, under the right conditions, Asus' estimate of \"up to 10hrs\" is achievable.  I get the idea that the charging system on this tablet may be a little fragile, as they warn you not to leave it on the charger for extended periods of time.  I generally charge overnight.Display:  My only complaint is a small one.  The display could possibly be just a little brighter for outdoor use.  It is plenty bright enough for any indoor situations, even bright lighting.  The resolution is quite good.  The Galaxy Note and the iPad are noticeably more vivid, but you are looking at $200 - $300 more.  The Nexus is slightly better.  Maybe Asus sacrificed a little screen brightness to gain battery life.Processor:  Can't really comment other than that the high res pictures take a second or two to fully render, so this may cause some problems for gamers.  Probably depends on the game, but I don't use the tablet for that.  There are some good technical comparisons on the web if that is a concern to you.Durability:  I must say that stories of the screens spontaneously cracking were disconcerting.  Didn't find much to support it when I Googled it.  I purchased the Minisuit Classic Flip Stand Case from Amazon and am very happy with it.  Also put a screen protector on it.Camera:  It takes a nice picture in bright light  That's about all I can say.Audio:  It does have pretty good sound quality through its own speakers.  It is not Blue Ray so don't expect it.  It's just good enough that it doesn't sound like a transistor radio (for those that remember them).  There is a built in mixer to fine tune the sound a little.  Max volume could afford to be a little higher.  Might be a problem using in a very noisy environment without ear buds.Screen responsiveness:  Someone recently commented about a lag in the key board.  I have experienced this, too, but have experienced it on other virtual keyboards, too.  It doesn't present a problem for me.  I have actually begun using the voice commands more frequently.  I have never used voice recognition software that typed this accurately.  Even with the screen protector on, the screen has been quite responsive to touch.I have rated it 4 stars based on its own merits.  If I were rating it compared to other 10\" tablets in the $250 range, it would get 5+ stars.", "Date": "March 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very good product.

I'm happy, she's happy, I'm happy that she's happy...it was a good choice for a gift.Cons -Only thing so far I don't like is transferring files from my Linux OS to the tablet, kind of a pain but I found a work around (Airdroid). The only other thing that I can think of is the lack of Adobe Flash Player support in the stock browser and chrome, won't likely be an issue in the future as HTML5 continues to gain popularity but for some applications it is a drawback. Solution for that is a browser that still maintains Adobe Flash Player support like Mozilla Firefox and backdooring in Adobe Flash Player, google is your friend.I may end up buying another one because I like using her's so much.", "Date": "January 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Wife Happy", "Author": "Wallace A.

Haven't had this for long but the time spent with it shows a strong indication that the purchase choice was an excellent one.Wanted a quick, not necessarily fastest ten inch tablet available today with front and rear cameras, a micro sd slot, newest version of android (Kit Kat not really available yet to the masses nor do I wanna flash since its my parents.), long battery life and a micro hdmi slot if possible or miracast enabled.This tablet had everything I was looking for and more. The Intel chip does well with performance. Things are quick and responsive but I've read that with the Intel chip since not specifically designed for a mobile platform OS, somethings may run slower than expected. Haven't encountered any hiccups but again just recently had got so time will tell. Ymmv.Everything was easy to setup, screen looks great, nice having full hd too. Sound is crystal and vibrant.  Shot a few test vids and sound came out very nicely, parents even commented on it. Pictures look great whether taking pics, vids or looking at others I online. The weight for a ten inch tablet is superb. It's very, very light and I even purchased a procase leather case for it and it's still light, manageable for one hand holding still.The one drawback for me is that the screen isn't the brightest so you may want to consider other tablets if you like to take your tech on the go and use outside frequently. Other than that, nothing else has come up for any drawbacks, and if they do will try and update.Very pleased with this purchase.

It seems like a lot of pro reviews about the FHD 10 are  lukewarm and compare it to the Nexus 10 which from what I've seen cost $100 + (33%) more street price than the memo pad but the users reviews I've seen talk pretty favorably about this tablet so I decided to roll the dice. I also own a 2012 Nexus 7 so I have something to compare it to.Back story: 2 weeks before Christmas I went to Staples and bought what I thought was the memo pad fhd 10 on sale but it turned out to be the lower spec ME102. I used it for about a week and it wasn't bad but then I figured out I had the wrong tablet and I found the FHD 10 for only $20 more so I ordered it and returned the ME102 and I'm glad I did because the FHD smokes the it in every way.I'm pretty technical so I did my homework on what was out there in this price range and what attracted me was the screen resolution, 2 gb of ram, the microSD slot, and the HDMI output. I was a little concerned about the processor causing app compatibility problems after reading some of the reviews but so far I haven't run across one app that doesn't install and work. I don't  play games on this so I can't really comment on extreme gaming  performance but I use this tablet pretty heavy for day to day tasks and for what I do it's very responsive and so far much better than my 2012 Nexus 7 which cost me more than the FHD.Some people complained about the build quality seeming flimsy and while the shell doesn't feel as industrial as my Nexus 7 time will tell. I don't beat my toys so I don't see this as a problem but do yourself a favor and buy a nice fitting case for it, they're not easy to find for this specific tablet but they're available online.Sound is very good for small speakersInstalled a 32 gb micro sd card no problemHooked up the hdmi to a tv and it worked great. I don`t normally plug a tablet into my tv but I could see this being handy if the need arises.The graphics are very very nice, crisp and clear. The bigger pictures in the Facebook app take a couple of seconds to appear but my Nexus 7 takes longer.As far as performance its peppy and responsive, quicker than the nexus and the ME102.As far as apps it has a nice assortment of basic Android apps but I wish I could uninstall what I don't want but Asus has them locked in.", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "LOVE this tablet!!!", "Author": "Jodi Artzberger", "ReviewID": "R1YE0PIW2XPWOW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is perfect and couldn't fit my needs any better!

But for the past 5 years, I have only been disappointed time and again.  I keep swearing that I'll never buy another ASUS products again, but then I'm lured in by a low price or a sale, and then I remember why it's never worth it.The Good:So this tablet has some good things about it.  The screen is absolutely fantastic.  I was very happy with it.  The design and build quality seem to be okay.  The form factor is not as good as Samsung's, but for the $100 price difference, I was willing to accept the massive bezels.  The backing was okay, but not as grippy as I was hoping. Despite what other reviewers say, note that the back is plastic, not rubber.  So despite its dimpled surface, it's still slippery and hard to hold with one hand (a common problem with oblong Android tablets). The sound was impressive for a tablet and the HDMI out is fantastic. I also like that it had a micro SD slot. That's so important and makes Apple look like a bunch of fools for charging $100 for an additional 16GB of storage.The Failure:Unfortunately all of the wonderful things about this tablet come crashing down to a complete failure due to a completely useless CPU.  I bought this tablet for one primary reason: To read PDFs.  My 7\" tablet is a little too small for reading rich media PDFs, so I wanted a 10\" screen.  I thought: \"How can I go wrong with a budget tablet with a 10\" screen, just for reading PDFs?\"  Well, with ASUS, they always seem to find a way to go wrong.  Adobe Reader struggles with this CPU to open a 4.7MB 32 page PDF that has lots of images.  At first I thought that perhaps this PDF was simply too much for any tablet.  But my 18 month old 7\" budget tablet handled it with no problems (other than the screen being too small).So I'll be seeking a new tablet with a different processor.  Clearly between ASUS and Intel, they can't make a tablet that can get even the basics of performance right.  FWIW:  If you own one of these and have this problem, there are a couple of alternative PDF readers that do perform within reason.  I'm personally going to return mine, as I feel no need to suffer the potential future consequences of this broken architecture.Bonus Junk:As with all ASUS products, this thing is loaded with bloatware.  Absolute crap software, and tons of it. I'm used to this after owning a number of ASUS laptops.  But at least with Windows you can permanently uninstall their bloatware (you know, over the course of two hours). But as with all bloatware on Android, you're stuck with this.  The best you can do is force-stop the apps and then disable them... sometimes.  There were a few I could not disable.  And even when you disable them, they still take up precious space in your 16GB of storage.  So plan to get that SD card.  Or root it once your warranty is up.I hate the thought of buying an Apple tablet.  But I might be forced to, given the currently disappointing lineup in the Android space.", "Date": "November 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Charger not working", "Author": "Toddler Mom \"CityMom\"", "ReviewID": "RMUTMXWRL7MZW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Just got it and the charger is not working.Not happy about that.

So I decided to try the Asus tablet. If you use a tablet for the things that most people do then this one will not disappoint you. It has very good resolution for watching movies or playing games on your apps. The speakers are clear and crisp although having them on the back is in no way ideal. To get the best sound you have to cup your hands while holding it to direct the sound from the speakers to the front. It is slick and smooth between screens and on the web and I have had no issues where the processor is concerned. My friend who owns a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 7\" tablet played around with mine and liked it better than his. I have had no problem with Apps except one or two which are specifically designed to run on the ARM based processing system, but these programs are very specific like XBMC and most people do not use them anyway. If you do you would have to get a custom made version of the app and it still will not run perfectly.But as I stated all of the normally things that people do on a tablet this one will handle with ease. I have not tried any PC type games on it to know how those run, but from demo's I have seen they should be just fine. And with expandable memory you can take it well past those high priced tablets for far less money. If you are looked for a great tablet at a reasonable price that does all the things you want than this just might be the one for you.", "Date": "March 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great tablet at a great price.

In many ways the tablet moves this genre of technical interface down the field by a mile. You have to keep in mind that a tablet is much closer to a computer,  it\u2019s truly multitasking and only limited by processor and memory.  I purchased this for my wife, who had become disenchanted with the hand me down iPad, not being able to upgrade, and some applications working slow or not at all.  It took all of a minute to find our wifi, and enter the code.  Internet interface is a breeze, 10,000 plus applications to choose from, most if not all the iPad ones were duplicated. Bluetooth connectivity to BOSE speakers, in one step,  file system for storing pictures, text and other, just not as easy on an ipad.  We are still learning the in and outs and little secrets. Like on the Facebook application,  if you see a picture you like, there is an icon that allows you to capture the image and then store in a file on the tablet.  I am sure ipad has this too but the tablet makes it very easy to do.  One of the really major differences is the aspect of having more than one application up and running, so if you use one, the others are  still running and swapping back and forth is effortless. But for 1/3 the cost of iPad and much less than other choices, this is a great deal. We are very pleased. Next go around I will seriously consider tablet before an iPad.

No big deal, but worth mentioning.I have found one negative:  The touch keyboard places the space bar too close to the menu soft button (not a hardware button, but a software button on the face, just below the screen), which makes it too easy to accidentally hit the menu button while typing.

HBO GO, Showtime Anytime, WatchESPN, and MLB At Bat are the major streaming services that I've tried that either do not work properly or at all. While Intel promised 90% app compatibility, these are major apps that I find essential.If you can look past this (or find a workaround, I was able to side-load an older version of HBO GO that worked) this is a very good value. The full HD screen is crisp and makes web browsing a joy. I put a few of my own 1080p movies on the device and it looked great. You won't find another 10inch tablet that has a 1080p display for under $300. For this reason alone it is a good buy. The Intel processor, despite the compatibility issues, runs pretty smooth and you won't find any problems navigating the device or the web. Some of the more intense 3D games don't perform as well as the top end tablets, but from what I've tried, games like Real Racing 3, Asphalt 8, and Dragon Age are all certainly playable. They look great on the Full HD screen as well.So this will all come down to whether or not you are willing to put up with some major apps being unusable on this device.

Love the SD card slot, drag and drop of music, vids, and pics.  Heartily recommending to friends.I decided to get a tablet because I am a pro photographer who needed a better way than binders to carry around portfolio photos.  I also want hand-held access to the many great reference books available online, but I don't plan extended reading.  If I did, I'd probably spend more to get the best 2560 screen.  (Note that my 5 star rating is for overall quality, usefulness, and value.  The screen itself is very good, but I did see better, so I'd give it a 4 star rating.  But at this price point, it shines.)I trusted this brand because I bought my first Asus laptop in China back in 2004--and it still works today (even with 750MB of RAM, Windows XP, and its little 40GB HDD.)  In 2010 I bought another Asus laptop, a powerful i7 machine with 12GB of RAM--and it's a true workhorse.So, Asus was an easy choice, one I'm glad I made.Contrast and color are excellent for portraits and fine art photos, and there is an important set of controls for color temp, hue, an saturation.  Streaming works great, which is also important to me, as I like to watch KelbyTraining and other videos.  The external sound is clear and loud, and with headphones, high quality for jazz and classical music.Build quality feels and looks excellent.  I like the ergonomics--even in kind of awkward positions, it's easy for me to pick this up and put it down one handed without feeling like it's going to slip.  Nice textured surface on the back without being rough or sticky.Using the tablet is, thankfully, super easy.  I tried quite a few others and had trouble with buttons, dropdowns, etc.  All easy for me on this MeMo.I'm finding it very fast for streaming, etc.  One thing I've learned is that sites like facebook and Youtube work better, faster, and smoother using an app rather than accessing through a browser.This tablet includes two browsers, Chrome and an Asus browser.  Chrome works much better for me.I went with Android because I wanted the most open system possible.  I might have chosen Windows, but the price and weight of those tablets was too much.  Like I mentioned, my needs are simple.I'm able to use an SD card to add storage space, and the OS on this tablet makes organizing photos a snap.  No dealing with crazy apps to load my own images onto my own device!  Just drag and drop!  Connects right to the USB port of my PC.Only thing I haven't tried yet is the HDMI port, but I can see it as useful for hooking to newer TV's to display photos and play slideshows.  I have to buy a cable.The virtual keyboard is easy to use, surprisingly.  For now, I really want just a cover for it, but I might consider one that includes a keyboard.All-in-all, a great choice.

But in October I finally got down to saying right, time to get one. So I was pretty sure that I was going to get a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 32gb but I couldn't find a 32gb on amazon that didn't come with a bundle of some kind. Which might be great for you but the offer I saw I didn't like. Then the other 32gbs were Tab 2s.  And the Galaxy Note 32gb was too expensive and I didn't want to spend that much or need all of the processor. In fact I could only find the Tab 3 16gb for 399 and it went on sale for 299. So I had resigned myself to that. Then I found the Asus MeMO Pad FHD 10.1 32GB and it was priced at 299 on sale for Black Friday. It had the same chip and the 16gb Samsung tab 3, but double the ram and the storage. So it started to become a no-brainer. It had the removable SD storage, dual cameras, a Micro USB port and a Micro HDMI. And that pretty much sold it. I checked out some online reviews and the machine seemed like it would be fine and it is. It's my first tablet, and it does what I expected it to do, browse the internet, play a youtube video, connect to the cloud and allow me to read a book. I have not tried to play a movie yet but I don't expect that will be an issue. The speakers are great, clear and loud, good sound. The apps all work especially the ones I wanted. I have no complaints.I will say that patience in waiting for Black Friday, waiting for android 4.2, doing a lot of reading and reviewer research really helped me to make a decision on this tablet.

This Asus tab is more affordable, much more, and beats both the Samsung and Sony in performance. The Samsung was quirky, and eventually the WiFi connection failed. Then I purchased a Sony Xperia, which has some impressive characteristics, like it's virtually waterproof. But, when I inserted the micro SD card, it would not recognize many files, like movies, and audio, that I was able to access on the Samsung Galaxy. So I returned that quickly. You need to have the micro SD card working, or why even have it.The Asus Memo tab appears on par with the Samsung in it's material and fabrication. I believe it is has a slightly quicker processor. The keyboard has been the most reliable and least idiosyncratic. It surfs the web well, and I've added a few movies to watch.Overall, it is on par or even better performance with the Samsung Galaxy and is more than $100 less in price. It's a no brainer. This is the best tab for the money, unless you want something very specific in the latest technology, then you'll have to pay for that elsewhere.

Everything has worked as promised.  I have looked for the issues that were written about in the previous reviews and so far haven't experienced any of them.The screen brightness that was discussed was fixed by taking it off of Automatic and setting it to my liking.One thing that users may need to be aware of is that you cannot just move apps to the external SD Card as you can on prior versions of the OS.  That is one of the reasons I went with the 32G model.As far as pricing...if you are considering purchasing this tablet make sure to check out the current price.  The price for this tablet can swing almost $60 depending on who the supplier is.This tablet is fast and display quality is very good.  I found the sound to also be acceptable.  It does have a limiter on volume when using a headset.  This can be overcome through third party software.Speaking of Apps...once I connected to Google Play and did a restore of all apps the tablet was hit with about 250 apps being installed very quickly.  Out of this number there were 6 that were not compatible with this tablet.  Also all apps work just as they should.Overall at the price point you can get this tablet for it is a very good value and I think most will be very happy.  One note though if you are coming from the latest generation IPAD or even a NEXUS I find this tablet to perform generally below those models in terms of display quality and speed.Don't get me wrong though -- for the price -- the performance of this tablet would be hard if not impossible to beat with any model.One last thing regarding WiFi...where I use this tablet we use a WiFi network that uses a zero hand-off system. This means that all APs are seen as one AP.The switch over between APs can be a challenge even for the  best devices.  I must tell you that this tablet has worked flawlessly between multiple APs and the speed at which it has negotiated this architecture has been the best I have seen among the hundreds of devices used here including laptops, phones and yes IPADS and Nexus devices.I am not sure what ASUS did on the WIFI portion of this tablet but it is impressive performance.I would highly recommend this tablet to even the most tech sensitive people I know and simply ask them to throw everything at it they can...I am convinced they will come to the same conclusion I have.", "Date": "March 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "I wish I'd bought this the first time around!", "Author": "miss-honesty \"Tiffany\"", "ReviewID": "R3PUGOPSEJOSCC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought a cheaper, obselete brand for my mother for a Christmas gift.

My mom who isn't very tech savvy said \"It's like night and day!\" I bet you can figure out what's the sunny day: this one. It has a USB hook up in case you want to attach a keyboard case to it. The screen is beautiful and crisp. The camera has a high resolution I compare to my iPhone. It is lighter than the Matricom I bought first. The wifi connects and stays connected without hiccups.

The only problems I saw is that you really can't open more than one window at a time (multi-tasking). You can open a floating window but you really can't have them open and usable at the same time. (Unless I'm missing something. I'm pretty good at figuring out how to do things and smartphones and a table basically is just a large smartphone that you can't make a phone call on.) I also wouldn't advise using an alternate browser such as go launcher even though it is supposedly made to use on a tablet. I found those slowed the tablet down and the launcher that it comes with, although not fancy, is more than adequate. It operates smoothly, screen looks good (I'm too old to see all that many pixels) and is pretty quick. Would recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "March 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "LOVE IT!", "Author": "R.

My only issue/concern is that the battery life seems to be NOTHING like my ASUS t300 Transformer.  I could leave it in sleep mode for days, literally, but the MeMo will not last more than 15 hours.  I have power management set to extreme.....screen off, wi-fi off, etc,  ASUS Account is eating up the battery even in sleep mode.  So bad, I am thinking I may have a defective battery or software.  The t300 Transformer battery life was fantastic.....very disappointed with the MeMo solely due to battery life.....itis faster and better than the t300 in every other aspect.UPDATE:  After snooping through Power Management, I disabled the app \"ASUS Account\" and has improved the battery life tremendously.  My last charge lasted almost 3 days with regular use (Facebook, Email, web browsing  and a few YouTube videos).  I have started manually turning off wi-fi, as the \"OFF when in sleep mode\" power mgmt option either doesn't work, or I have an App that re-opens wi-fi and eats the battery while in sleep mode.  Feeling MUCH better about the MeMo now, and upgraded from 3 to 4 stars.....I did see that Amazon has suspended sales of this unit due to a possible bad batch, so that might explain my power mgmt issues.  Otherwise, contrary to what others have reviewed I have no issues with Email (3 different accounts), app compatibility, or web browsing.  If power management worked as it should I would gladly give it \u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606!Another Update:I no longer need to manually turn off wi-fi, evidently an update fixed that issue.  A single charge is now lasting as long as my ASUS T300 Transformer did (BEFORE I dropped it....oops).  I've been browsing for over 2 hours and still have over 80% of my battery left.

I have had this Android tablet for 2 months and for the most part I can say that I like it (except that I was very bummed to find out that you cannot view your Amazon Prime videos on an Andoid tablet but you can on an iPad). We bought this tablet for 3 features that our iPad lacked: 1) Flash support  2) ability to upload pictues on ebay, amazon, etc.  3) browser does not refresh everytime the back button is hit or when changing tabs - very annoying and time consuming on iPad Safari (waiting while it refreshes every time you change screens).  The graphics on the asus memo are wonderful, sharp with great color, smooth videos. Internet is fast.  I did not see much bloatware at all on mine. The Andoid OS runs smooth, no problems there.However the Asus tablet does have some flaws, the major one being that the battery has started to give me problems charging. Yes I followed the instructions before using it to charge the battery. Now I leave it plugged in for 8 hours and it says its half charged.  I leave it plugged in another few hours and its fully charged, but after only 2 hours of use the battery is dead again and the tablet shuts down. They claim in the advertisement that the battery has a 10 hour use, that must mean for the first month. When I first bought it it charged quickly with in a couple of hours and would last all day of use. (This could be an app using excessive battery, so I will research it more and update this later.)Apparently it does not charge while in use (unlike my iPad which charges the battery WHILE I'm using it). If I use the asus while the charger is plugged in it tells me that the battery is drained and shuts down. For example, yesterday it said the battery was getting low (5%) so I plugged the charger in but it still powered itself down. I turned it back on, it ran for a few minutes then powered itself down. If you plan on running any big updates or downloads of your music collection, backing up, etc make sure the battery is fully charged and hope that your update/download/backup does not take longer than the battery life because it will not charge while in use.Another problem I have with this tablet is that the touchscreen can be downright flaky. Many times I have to click a couple times on something before it registers and then often it will enlarge the text instead of selecting it. So I tap, nothing, tap again, nothing, tap, tap, enlarge, tap again, finally works.You can long press to copy and paste text, but I find that tap and hold to paste the text is often cumbersome because again it wants to enlarge instead of bringing up the paste button. so I end up doing a long press then tap then double tap them long press then tap press and paste. Also annoying is the word suggestion bar, as you type words pop up, its predicting what you are typing and you can click on the word, helpful for long words but annoying for normal use.  It slows down typing for me. Hitting the backspace requires hitting it more because first you have to delete the predicted word.If you want to use Adobe Flash then be prepared to have to manually install it. Adobe Flash stopped supporting Android after version 4.0. I used instructions found online that did work to install flash so it is working now.That was one reason I bought the Android tablet because the apple iOS doesn't support flash and found out that the newer Android doesn't either (you have to manually install a set of instructions as a work around to the OS.)Android has a Google Play store which is similar to the iPad itunes App Store. You set up a Google account so if there is an app you want to buy it will charge it to the account. There are many useful free apps.I would give it 5 stars if this was based on android 4.2 only, because the OS is superb. But the asus tablet itself has some shortcomings with the battery not charging while plugged in, the battery not lasting very long  after 2 months and the touch screen being flaky.*** I would like to add that it seems whenever I give a negative review that I quickly get a few votes for NO to the \"Was this Review Helpful?\" question listed under the review. I believe that people who sell or make the product have a vested interest and some may try to make a review appear \"not helpful\" if it is a negative review.

My primary purpose for buying it was to use it as an e-reader for viewing digital magazines, and it excels at that job.  I also use it for email, watching videos, and browsing the web.  Though I haven't measured it, the battery charge lasts much longer than other devices, such as a netbook, that I have used in the past.My only criticism is the sparsity of documentation.  The \"user manual\" that came with it provides little more than a physical description of the device, plus how to turn it on and charge the battery.  A downloadable manual that I found online contains that information plus rudimentary descriptions of a few of the apps.  This being my first Android device, I have struggled a bit trying to figure things out for myself.  Of course, not having a keyboard, this and similar tablets are not ideal for office automation tasks, but a Bluetooth keyboard and cover is available as an optional accessory.In summary, this tablet excels at the tasks for which it was designed and is an exceptional value.", "Date": "January 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "I like it okay except for the power issues which is really a major thing I guess.", "Author": "Shirley Mickelson", "ReviewID": "R188L2UVA14QBB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Most of the time I like it okay. I feel like it is maybe not as good of quality as I had hoped. I had to force start it with the paperclip in the little hole in the side after only a couple weeks. Today when I turned it on it was all blurry and weird and I thought I would have to do that again because it was not responding but finally cleared up and was normal after a couple of minutes. I had it on but in sleep mode when I went to bed the other night and it started turning on for a few seconds then turning off for a few seconds and just kept doing that so I had to turn it off completely to get it to stay off. It doesn't always charge when I plug it in. I think the charger doesn't always make a good connection. I doubt that I would have bought it if I would have known this about it before I got it. I feel like I maybe should return it but after putting all my personal info on it I hesitate to do that. I guess I could have someone show me how to clear all that but I just don't have much spare time to do all that.It's been 3 1/2 months now and am adding to my review.

I can read and type comfortably on my lap in front of the fire.  The navigation is simple and intuitive, and on the whole it seems to be a more streamlined experience.  The hardware works and everything was easy to dive into right out of the box.Cons: The touch screen is driving me crazy.  The internet is all about chasing links, and I'm used to the crisp accurate click of a mouse on that little hand.  It's not always easy to FIND the links on a touch screen, and finding the right stylus and right technique shouldn't be so hard.  I'm really tired of shooting off to locations unplanned (No back button!)  I think the random zooming in and out is the worst.OK, as I said, more of a comment on the Android experience than the Asus tablet.  I think I like the tablet just fine.

After only 3.5 hours of use I was all the way down to 9%. That is a far cry from \"up to 10 hours\".At this point, I am finished with this product. I am not really interested in finding out what other ways it can disappoint me. I did the factory reset, tossed it back in the box and am returning it tomorrow morning. I figured I would give it a shot, knowing that if I was unhappy with it that I could return it hassle free thanks to Amazon.", "Date": "December 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "SO frusterating!", "Author": "Robin", "ReviewID": "R2SX7AIS54NLKV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I hate mine, I am going to sell it!

I'm not an Apple fanboi so I've been looking at Androids too. I bought my tablet used from a friend a couple of years ago. Apple's latest iOS update has pretty much killed the 1st gen pads. Apps crash constantly, browsing is crappy, etc. So, I'm looking for something else and something affordable.Today I looked at the ASUS MeMO Pad FHD 10 at a local brick & mortar store. I played with it for a long time. It's everything all the positive reviews said for the most part. However, there is one HUGE thing that killed the deal for me:The \"Home\" button is in the center bottom of the screen when in horizontal mode. This means that if you're holding the tablet in your hands your thumb can't reach the home button like you can on an iPad. You have to let go of one side of the tablet to hit the button.iPads have the home button on the short side of the tablet so when you're holding it horizontally (which I normally do) your thumb can easily reach it to turn off apps. I've become used to that.I'm really disappointed as I was ready to buy this tablet. I really didn't want to buy another iPad, as they're so expensive. I may have to settle for a used one or a 2nd or 3rd gen model.[EDIT] Okay, perhaps I was a bit harsh with only two stars. I upped it to three. Everything BUT the home button is really nice. Especially the price. Just so people don't think I'm an Apple fanboi trolling Asus reviews (I've got better things to do with my time actually), I own a Motorola Droid Razr M Android phone. I've never owned an iPhone. I've owned Windows computers ever since v3.1. My kids gave me an iPod for Christmas one year, though. My personal view is Apple products are overpriced.It's all what you get used to. I'm used to having the home button right at my fingertip (or thumb, actually).[UPDATE 04 December 2013]Well, I ended up buying this tablet. The only other 10 inch tablet I could find with a Home button not in the center was a Galaxy Tab 2. That button is on the left/bottom and would be sufficient but I learned that the Android version it runs is older and newer updates place the Home button in the center. So, I went ahead and bought the ASUS.I have changed my rating to 5 stars to reflect how impressed I am with this tablet after playing with it for a few days.It is taking me awhile to get used to the Home button placement but it's not as big a deal as I had feared. I'm impressed with the speed of the tablet, the clarity of the screen, among other things.Lesson learned: Never say never. :-)", "Date": "November 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "biggest mistake ever !!!!!!", "Author": "Theo", "ReviewID": "R6AV4697ALO50", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "ProsDurableLarge memoryConsDisorginized systemMost apps are always buggyAndroid suxCamera res is crapWord processor is rediculous does not even have spell check", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not what I was looking For but a great Tablet", "Author": "Robert T Church", "ReviewID": "R1FSZN03UECOGV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This Tablet was too hard for me to use.
