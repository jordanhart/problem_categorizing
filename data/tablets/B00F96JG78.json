{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best Value", "Author": "Joyce", "ReviewID": "R2FIR7IW69C0XU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this tablet because I didn't have a lot of money to spend and I thought that it had all the features that other much higher priced brand names have. It arrived sooner than expected by two weeks and was packaged very well. There was no damage and everything on it works. None of the connectors were loose or broken. The battery charger and additional cables work excellently. I put Sketch Book Pro on it right away and have been enjoying myself immensely ever since. I also liked the design for the micro SD card, it is recessed in the back so the card doesn't stick out or have a chance of getting accidentally hit with something. I put a 16GB micro card in there and it works without a hitch. The sound of the speakers is just as good as the HD 9 NOOK that I have and the display is better. Also, you get the newest version of android and there's no hindrance as to what vendor you purchase your apps from. My headphones sound well from the headphone jack and both of the cameras take excellent pictures. This is a very solid value for the price.", "Date": "November 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "My first day impression", "Author": "Y. Simon", "ReviewID": "R1SO80ZUFZI5A3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Goldengulf 9\" dual core tablet opinion:Pros:Decent battery lifeApplications are pretty responsiveScreen resolution pretty clear despite lower resolutionGoogle play app market is installedBare clean installation with few apps installed(no angry birds, only  flash and google chrome installed, safari 4.0 is the default browser)Android 4.2.2Wifi signal is pretty good throughout the house, can get decent signal even in the basementAudio quality is pretty loud, 1 speaker in the backFlash player actually worksCons:Camera could be a little better, it feels like a standard laptop camera that you get when you buy a computer.Power adapter gets quite warm despite it being only a 5v charger and charging when tablet is shut offUSB to recharge the tablet takes forever even if you have and use USB power adapter.Homepage default to some sort of weird news/feed website. Try setting it to google.com a few times keep resetting to some random website?Screen smudges somewhat easyCharge indication light confusing? Red when you plug in the power adapter, but the green light is still on at the same time(see next sentence). No extra light when using usb to charge just a green light next to the front camera.When you plug in the USB and have the tablet on. You will see a battery icon that says charging, in reality it is not even charging and battery percentage will still drop even if you don't have it in mass storage mode. You actually need the tablet off first in order for it to be actually charging. It will actually be charging with power adapter.. but that adapter gets hot already just charging when the tablet is off.Some websites with smaller text tends to get a bit pixelated, images are fine.Other/Misc:When you select free shipping. It will take a while before it arrives: My order was placed on November 4th 2013, and it was shipped out November 5th 2013. I finally receive the tablet today which is November 18th, It took 13 days to arrive to the east coast. I was not in a hurry, but for people who select free shipping be prepared to wait a while before it arrives.This tablet comes in a standard white box and what looks like a generic tablet printed on the top. On the inside you get a screen protector if you want to install it and then the tablet itself. Under the tablet is the power adapter and an adapter for USB. The tablet uses the very small USB port but gives you an adapter so you can connect standard USB devices.If you decide to use the screen protector, install it immediately. I put it(screen protector) aside to test the tablet out first and then my finger prints smudge the screen real easily and all over the place. I cleaned it then try to install the screen protector only to find that it was getting quite a few annoying air bubbles while installing. If you do install the protector, do it while the screen is clean and the protector being very static  so you don't have to use your credit card to try and remove air bubbles. The more dust, and wiping on the screen the more bubbles you will get. Maybe they should just install the screen protector instead by default?Tablet is shipped with 25% battery charge and got a good half an hour installing apps and running stuff before it told me battery low.The user manual was.. not so helpful. It told you how to do a few stuff on android like check email use some buttons but it didn't actually point out any of the tablet features like how to insert the MicroSD card slot, where the speaker is adjusting volume etc.. basic stuff. Easy enough to figure out, but it looks like it was just a generic catch all manual which is a very small folded sheets of paper stapled together.Generic Benchmarks:AnTuTu benchmark app - ranking 12860 (better then Samsung galaxy S2, less then HTC One X)*for some reason this app list it as a Allwinner A10 frequency 60.0-1056.0MHz x2 cpu (bug in the app software)cpu: allwinner a20 dual core ??Mhzgpu: Mali-400mpFinal Thoughts:For the price this tablet I think it is worth getting, A generic brand is good for people who want to learn how to use a tablet and to use it as a ebook reader. I have not test this tablet out for gaming, but for basic stuff like surfing the web and actually being portable throughout the house is a plus. The decent battery life is something that I like also, though time will tell if the battery will actually last a while before I have to replace it. I am not to happy about the charger getting very hot, might stop by radioshack to see what they have in terms of chargers. Watching youtube and visiting most websites, you probably won't notice the smaller screen resolution.Also I would to point out, no where on the box or tablet does it say Goldengulf, other then the key chain(mine came in red). It is just a plain white box with a generic tablet picture(not the tablet that is in the box) and when you take the tablet out. It is a plain white tablet with some grainy design in the back. When you turn on the tablet you get the A20 dual core logo, then \"tablet pc android\" on the loading screen.Yes, it can run angry brids, youtube and skype.. but you gotta install the apps yourself as mine came with just a bare installation which is good! Sometimes companies install so much useless stuff you don't need, it is a pain to uninstall. This means that you get plenty of storage space to actually install and put what you want.", "Date": "November 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best 9 inch tablet for the price you can find!", "Author": "medman", "ReviewID": "R260UVXI2PSCLB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My laptop power jack burned out, so decided to get a tablet instead of a new laptop.

As far as I can tell it is this tablet shown above. Mine has a white plastic back cover. It is hard to tell who makes it as it says nothing on the box, manual, etc. Though inside the terrible users manual it says MID-Android. So based on the fact that my tablet has a 9\" screen, a 1.6 Ghz Dual Core A23 processor and it apparently comes with 512MB RAM and 8GB of storage this is likely the right tablet. I say supposedly because if you go into settings/storage it says \"Internal Storage\" 504MB, then it says \"internal storage\" 8GB.I'm assuming the first number is actually the memory, why it labels them both as \"Internal Storage\" is anyone's guess.It also has an SD card section on the storage settings screen though the slot on the tablet says \"TD\"?.It is running 4.2.2 Ice Cream Sandwich. I have no clue what the screen resolution is as it doesn't say anywhere in the settings, in the user manual, on the box, etc., but it's pretty low, washed out, and grainy. Maybe 1024x640 or so? Several apps such as the Paypal app and Yahoo weather will not even install because the play store says \"this app is not compatible with your device\". I can only assume it is because the app requires a higher screen resolution to run? -shrug-Battery life seems fair. When it arrived it was 76% charged and I used it for an hour or two and it got down to about 25%. It fully charged up in about an hour so we'll see how it goes. It connected to my wi-fi just fine. I also plugged it into my laptop using the included micro USB adapter (it comes with 2 of them, one with a male and one with a female USB adapter on the other end of the dongle) and they seem to talk to each other just fine. I'm not going to try to figure out the permissions right now so I just put everything in the public user folder (Windows 7) that I want to copy to the tablet because it can access that just fine.I also have a Samsung Galaxy 4S and an iPad 4. This is clearly inferior to both but my expectations were pretty low. You get what you pay for.Most of the apps I wanted to install did install just fine and they seem to work fine, such as eBay, Flipboard, StumbleUpon all seem OK. I also installed a free file manager called \"File Manager (Explorer)\" that works fine for connecting to other computers on my network over wi-fi. I used to have a Motorola Xoom tablet (sold it and bought an iPad 2 years ago) and this is what I used on that tablet for the same purpose and it works great. There was another file manager that was pre-installed on the tablet but I didn't see a way to access files on the network, only local files so I disabled that one and downloaded the other which is much better for my purposes.It has dual cameras but they both suck, especially the front facing camera, but I don't plan to ever take pictures or video with this anyway.All in all, so far so good. We'll have to wait and see how well it holds up over time.I hope this helps somebody in making an informed purchasing decision.", "Date": "March 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "This is a nice unit", "Author": "big", "ReviewID": "R1CRUTY3QRBYJ8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The unit is as stated in the description .

And I didn't want to spend a lot of money on it. But when I opened the box I was amazed at how beautiful it was right out of the box. I was excited to charge it and get it working. It has been taking 4 hours to charge, I have been playing with it while it has been on charge. Downloaded some apps and learned how to use it while changing the look of it. I love Android for that reason. Customizing! The camera is not great. I wouldn't even use it. It sucks. But if you're just going to use this tablet, like I will be, some internet surfing, Vine, Youtube, movie watching. Then it's perfect. The picture quality is awesome. The sound quality is great. It could be louder, but I don't intend on watching anything without headphones anyway. I'm impressed with this item. It worked right out of the box. And I knew it was coming from China when I ordered it, and I expected it to take a lot longer than it did. I ordered it Dec 30, 2013. And it arrived today, Jan 10, 2014. Less than 3 weeks!

My daughter & I have put this tablet through its paces. I am on it through out the day & then she is when she comes home from school. I am purchasing another so that my daughter (age 10) can have her own. The tablet is cheap enough to be able to do so but it is not flimsy. We have not had any issues in the months that we have both used it pretty much all day long. The only problem is the metal piece that connects to the tablet to charger broke off. However, there is another port on the tablet that happens to fit the charger to my Virgin Moble cell. If you don't have one of these chargers, you can purchase one on Amazon for only $3. Mr.Li stands behind his product, of course & he resolves any issues that you might have. I emailed him about the time frame in which the 2nd  tablet would arrive(1st tablet came in 4 weeks from China) & he returned my email within minutes letting me know that it already had shipped from Amazon & would be delievered in a couple of days.

I can have multiple apps open and still peruse the internet with acceptable speed. I can stream video with average resolution fine, but higher resolution does seem to have a delay here and there. Your internet experience will depend upon which browser you use, as with any tablet using android. I played a boxing video game and it seemed to run smoothly. The only negatives are you need to turn the brightness down or the battery will drain in about an hour. If you use a lower brightness the battery lasts around 4 hours. You will need a micro SD card, or TF card, as the internal memory is sparse. Considering how cheap micro SD is now that is not really an issue. For the price I could not expect perfection, but it is reliably fast for my needs and has worked fine thus after nearly 3 weeks of use.Update: power adapter broker after a month.
