Came with a lovely black case and all the works. I cannot remember what I paid for it but it was a steal and still works beautifully. I can download my books from my local library and browse the internet, listen to music. I just love it", "Date": "September 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "A. Bosley", "ReviewID": "R1BJTPZYA8XF3I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my second tablet. The first was returned promptly. I purchased this refurbished but it very nice condition. It was approximately $40 and came preloaded with some classic e-books. It also came with a charger, black case, and a stylus.I had a little trouble getting started with it. I particularly disliked the App store that came with the product. After reading some online suggestions, I downloaded the SlideMe market. This helped tremendously and I haven't had any problems getting the apps I want for free.I have no problems connecting to free WiFi hotspots and wireless internet in my home. The size is great and I can easily read and use the internet without issues. Other than a few freeze ups now and then, I haven't had any issues. This was so much better than my last tablet and it was a great value.", "Date": "June 9, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004TH699Q"}}
