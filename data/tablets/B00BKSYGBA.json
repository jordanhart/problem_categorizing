Screen size, resolution and power are awesome!  The perfect balance of parent oversight and child independence is great!  Especially love the chore list integrated to earn nabi coins!  BUT seriously considering returning it because no accessories!  Especially a bumper for the XD I have a rough and tumble son.  Even though this is made for Tweens c'mon does anyone know an adult that doesn't have their own gear encased in a armour case?  Accidents can and so happen.  It especially needs a stand or the keyboard that was advertised in the photo.  My parents asked for what to get our son for his bday and I said Nabi (over his wish for an iPad).  He went to Skype them immediately on his new nabi and it was very inconvenient not having a stand as an accessory.  The stuff I bought for his bday from Target for nabi was horribly ill advised saying that their bumper and accessories \"fit all their sizes\".  If at least a few accessories were available (not even one of their travel bags are made for XD) this would be 5 stars!  Lack of forethought on accessories and no eta on their availability has me barely able to say a 3.Update: 7/22/2013 Currently in process of exchanging for the Nabi 2.  After searching hi and low at Best Buy and other electronic stores for a case, screen protector or stand it is after frustration and to no avail.  The curved sides on this make all other 3rd party options not fit.  Its large screen size which is awesome is a deficit because it is not the standard screen size of every tablet marketed.  If the sides were not curved I could make the Apple iPad accessories work.  I did contact Nabi directly to get a an eta on any accessories dropping for this version and they do not have any plans currently.  This could be such an awesome tool and I am almost not even wanting to do the exchange for the Nabi 2 because my son already has a Kindle Fire what sold this was the screen size and potential to be a laptop/desktop replacement and tablet all in one.  But Nabi does offer the great balance of more parenting controls and oversight and their chore list which is handy and I've yet to find something similar to make our Kindle Fire adapt.  We will see and I will update when hopefully exchange goes smoothly and we get the Nabi 2.", "Date": "June 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best productivity tool ever", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Writing Coach & Homeschool Mom\"", "ReviewID": "R3NV7LFFJJB6IH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My husband purchased this for me for my birthday and I absolutely love it. It is lightweight, reliable and cute.  I am a busy homeschooling mom and professional writer/editor and the Nabi XD's portability allows me to carry it everywhere and sneak in some work when I have an extra fifteen minutes or so.  I have a wireless keyboard and find I get more work done in the distraction-free environment the Nabi XD provides than I do on my laptop. The battery also seems to last longer. I retired my much-loved Nabi 2 and gave it to our 11-year-old. My husband, a gamer, admits he's a bit jealous of my Nabi XD, so we'll likely be buying another one with larger memory when it is released. I can hardly wait until all the accessories come out.  Nabi rocks.", "Date": "March 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Five reasons why you should save your money and not buy from nabi", "Author": "Paul Liechtenstein", "ReviewID": "R285FKLY6G6YS2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Based on my experience with nabi tablets (I've used all four nabis), I have came to the conclusion that while at first nabi is tempting to buy, in the long term, it is a bad buy.1. Product quality: I remember when nabi 1 came out and there was a huge issue with the charger, you'd think nabi learned from that incident and improved their charger's quality. nabi 2 came out and the charger issue came back. nabi had to built an entire site dedicated to replacing chargers. If you've ever taken apart a nabi and see the components inside, it is a frightful sight. Parts are held together with masking tapes.2. Customer service: Most of nabi's customer service is done through Facebook. You leave a comment on Facebook and someone from nabi will reply. I don't know who at nabi thought this is a good idea because most of the time your questions get lost in the sea of questions, complaints, and comments. Most customers complain about nabi support's response time which can take weeks or even months.3. Contents: Most of the preloaded applications on nabi can be downloaded for free from Google Play or AppStore depending on if you use Android or iOS. If you take a closer look at nabi's app list, most of them are demos you can get for free or copy-cat apps you can download from Google Play or AppStore. Why risk your money with an unknown brand just because they helped you pre-downloaded some apps?4. App Store: No Google Play. In order to get more apps on the device, you'll need to download the Amazon App Store which has a very limited selection of apps compare to the Google Play store. nabi does have their own app store called AppZone but the quantity and quality of the apps in AppZone leave much to be desired.5. There are better choices: Spend a few bucks on bumper and buy from a tablet reputable company like Google, Apple, Amazon, or Samsung. What you get is better product quality, customer service, content, and most importantly, peace of mind.", "Date": "September 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "nabi xd", "Author": "Michael", "ReviewID": "R2O381FMOZ8QBF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We purchased a nabi xd for our 5 yr old granddaughter and she loves it we also have a innotab for her and there is no comparison to the learning abilities she has gotten from the nabi xd so I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a tablet.

My 6-year-old son has a Nabi 2 and loves it. We bought the XD for her because she has a vision impairment so the larger brighter screen is easier for her to see. The screen is much brighter than the Nabi 2 and the build is very sleek and light. Over all I love this tablet and you can't beat the price for what you get. My only wish is that Nabi would offer a bumper for the XD like they have for the Nabi 2. I know it is meant for tweens but I'm sure there will be a lot of parents that will want the larger screen for their younger children and it would be a nice option.", "Date": "May 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Horrible customer service", "Author": "Mom in Virginia", "ReviewID": "R3CHWBK9LLKC9W", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "About a year ago Fuhu promised a group of customers (called HoldOut customers) whom purchased something called VIP Gold Membership the ability to switch their Nabi up to a Nabi XD when this product became available.  Fuhu has never upgraded my nabi as promised. Needless to say Fuhu (the makers of this product) does not return e-mails associated with this issue and gives you the run around on both the phone and their Facebook page.  Also, do not be fooled by the number of \"great\" comments you find on their Facebook page as Fuhu has been over the past month asking customers to post their good comments in exchange for a chance to win prizes.  I really wished I had not gotten involved with this product, but had instead shelled out the extra money for an ipad.  Also, there are more quality games through itunes for the ipad then there are through nabi (which still does not allow you to download google play). The only good thing I can say about Fuhu is that they do perform charity work to aid autistic children. This I applaud them for. Unfortunately, Fuhu needs to get their act together and be open and honest with their customers about their product as well as their ability to honor promises made to customers.

In order for it to be safe for kids the tablet must be put in what's called nabi mode.  Unfortunately, when you buy this tablet it may or may not have the capability to go in nabi mode.  It all depends on which one of their suppliers built the tablet and when it was manufactured.When I first called customer support about the issue I was on hold for over an hour and end up with someone who was clueless and when they transformed me the call was dropped.  Called back another day on hold this time for 45 minutes, talked to someone who tried to help out and then told me this tablet would not support nabi mode as it was for \"older kids\".  He needed to transfer me to 2nd level support.  After being put on hold for another 5-10 minutes he came back on the line to get get my phone number so I would not have to wait any longer.  No one ever called back.Since then I found a number of other people who were having the same issue with the tablet and lack of customer support.  Many of them have been told a new software version would be available by mid January that would fix the issue.It is now the end of January and I'm still waiting as there is still no update for the tablet.  I just called customer support again.  They told me nabi mode is not available for this tablet.  I mention about how they advertise this feature and was told that only some of the Nabi XD tablets support the nabi mode.  I asked if they could swap the tablet for one that has the mode and she had to talk to management.  When she came back she said they would be willing to do so but there is no guarantee it would have the nabi mode as they don't know which ones in their warehouse have nabi mode. They obviously don't know anything about quality control if they don't know what is in the products they sell.I then asked about getting my money back and I was transferred to another department and during the transfer the called was dropped.I will not be buying anything from this company again.  They just don't seam to know how to run a business and have no interest in correcting mistakes, where they are at fault.They also make a lot of promises for making accessories for the tablets for which always become available significantly late or never happen.  For instance there promised a keyboard of the XD tablet over a year ago.  Where is it?  Can't even buy one from another company as they have a proprietary connector.", "Date": "January 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "amazing pri", "Author": "syeda zehra", "ReviewID": "R1VZCTRJI2QS31", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hi love it my daughter loves it its amazing she learnd so much on it we goona travel soon it will be really help full it will keep her entertain", "Date": "July 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it!!!", "Author": "Diane Stevenson", "ReviewID": "R314DNK5RS87Z8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This an excellent tablet for kids.
