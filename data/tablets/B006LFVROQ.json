The touchscreen is worse than an early 90's PDA touchscreen.  Impossible to use even with the included stylus.  It is so slow it will hardly load the old and outdated operating system it comes with.  I had it about an hour before it went into the trash.  The worst part is, I bought it for my 18 month old son who has an affinity towards my tablet.  It is not even fit for an eighteen month old to use.  Absolutely worthless.  I don't usually leave bad reviews and I attempt to find some positive attribute in any item I purchase, but I had a bad feeling after I purchased this item and tried to cancel my order less than an hour after I had placed it, yet they refused to cancel the order.  I knew then to expect the worst.  Even with this expectation it is worse than even that!  Honestly, there is plenty of other cheap electronics for 50 dollars out there than this item.  Look elsewhere, you will be beyond frustrated and severely disappointed if you purchase this item.", "Date": "August 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "The worst", "Author": "Dania Jack", "ReviewID": "RYOUOGYJE4R5R", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this item for my 9 yr old niece who is very competent when it comes to electronic devices after 3 hours of usage the tablet wouldn't come bk on at all.

It has an outdated driod operating system, and no efficient way to add apps to it. It also is slow to respond to touch often and can sometimes be very slow. Surfing the net is okay but my iphone on wifi is significantly faster.  Also many sites such as netflix can't play video. Youtube worked okay. I purchased this unit to get my 21 month old daughter off my wife's iPhone 4s however it didn't work, it can only keep her attention for a few moments compared to the iPhones hours. Apps are very few and far between. The unit comes on and says phone?  It appears it is a droid SW cloan from a driod phone rather then and actual tablet PC as advertised. I sold it to a neighbor, it may work better for and older child with patients but for my daughter she expects instant results from action like with the iPhones. I would have returned it if I could have.Now in Sept. 2012 my neighbor informs me the unit will no longer power on, her 7yr old son liked it okay for playing angry birds, but again its incredibly slow compared to iPhone 4s and other apple products. Just returned here to see if there was any warranty offered doesn't appear so, guess I'm stuck. Don't waste your money with this junk, get a real tablet (new Samsung, Apple, etc.) make sure if your an Apple user you better play with driod SW before purchasing as I'm not impressed and would not purchase another tablet unless Apple OS is on it.", "Date": "April 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "So so", "Author": "PERER", "ReviewID": "R16QBZUH0JPX8S", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I ordered 2 tablets but only one worked but I returned with no problem and I got my money back.", "Date": "March 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "AFUNTA ADNROID 2.2 TABLET WITH 7 INCH TOUCHSCREEN", "Author": "Fructuoso Mata", "ReviewID": "RXTJN23796KHK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "IT ONLY LASTED FOR A MONTH AND A HALF AND I COULDN'T RETURN IT BECAUSE I HAD TO DO IT BEFORE 30 DAYS.", "Date": "January 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Ugh...Waste", "Author": "Lindsey McKay", "ReviewID": "R3QCFVZWGHP1TN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got this for $50.
