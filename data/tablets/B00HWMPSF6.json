{"Reviews": [{"Title": "This Tab Pro 10.1 is amazingly fast, with super vivid screen and I rate it at 4.5 stars, a detailed review follows...", "Author": "Daisy S \"Daisy S\"", "ReviewID": "RXRGDE6J5LA1U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATED REVIEW 5/7/14 - Since February, 2014, I have been using this Pro and am very impressed with it for several reasons. Keep in mind that this is a high end tablet meant for one who wants a very high screen resolution and has excellent specs on a WiFi only tablet. The performance I found peppy, the screen is just amazing in clarity and readability! And I love the new Kit Kat. First I list the PROS, which are wonderful, however, I give this 4.5 stars because there are some Cons that I want you to consider BEFORE you decide to purchase this or not...PROS/SPECIAL FEATURES ON THE TAB PRO 10.1:+ Screen Resolution/Weight/Size etc - The first thing I noticed is that side by side the screen spec are so so much better on this then previous Tab 2 and Tab 3. This model has a resolution of 2560 x 1600 (with 299 PPI-Pixels per inch) vs the older Tab 2 10.1 and Tab 3 10.1 had 800x1280 (with 149 PPI-Pixels per inch). Therefore, this model has DOUBLE the resolution of the older TAB line! Result: It is that much clearer and vivid screen with truly amazing clarity.+ Speed/Extra Memory - To check out how fast my apps opened and websites etc, I placed my Tab Pro next to my older Tab 2 and my Tab 3 8.0, the Pro was faster to load websites, faster to open apps etc. The memory in the Pro is 2GB of RAM vs the Tab 2 and 3 in the 10.1 the RAM is 1GB (it is 1.5GB on the Tab 3 8.0). So I am finding that this extra memory has made a difference in speed in my opinion.+ Speed of this unit / Memory etc (and special testing of speed) - This tablet has more memory and is MUCH faster than my other tablets. So I performed a tests today using my: Tab Pro 10.1, Tab 3 8.0 and Tab 2 10.1 (all WiFi only tablets. Results: I found that my Tab Pro 10.1 runs faster than my older Tab 2 10.1 does (with 4.2.2). **To better gauge the speed, I opened the same apps, etc using this tablet, Tab 3 8.0 and Tab 2 10.1 - This one opened apps, webpages and more so much faster than my other tablets!+ Ability to turn off the apps I did not want (helped my battery life). Did an actual test today to see if this made a difference and it did. After I safely turned off the apps that are safe to turn off, I now have more free memory and my battery life per hour has increased. So I documented this. If you have any questions about this, please ask in the comment section. Just a little tweak like this can really make a difference in battery lasting longer and better control over the memory etc.+ WiFi Connecting/Speed of WiFi and MORE - This tablet connects very quickly to my home WiFi and has never ever dropped the WIFi signal no matter where I am in my home. WiFi is OK in this device and does work very well, however, it is not as strong of a WiFi signal as SOME my other WiFi devices that I own presently. When I move closer to the router, it shows 4.5 to 5 bars, which is very good to excellent.*** To test the speed and strength of this WiFi and compare it to my other Android devices, I went to the Playstore and got the free app called WiFi Analyzer. This is a MUST HAVE app for any Android device as it gives you a visual report on the WiFi strength of your tablet, phone etc.****Do you need to know how to get on the internet when you are out of a WiFi range? Ask me about this as I have written an article on how to do this using a MiFi type of service from different service providers (please ask in the comment section for more info).+ SPECIAL INFO about INTERNET CONNECTION - Yes, this is a WiFi only, but when you are away from an WiFi internet hotspot location, there are ways to can get onto the internet such as MiFi and there are ways that you can purchase equipment so that you can have data when you do not have a WiFi hotspot available.+ Internet & Webpage & Video Viewing - The stock browser does a great job, however, I use Maxthon Browser and installed archived flash so I have great internet flash video viewing results and it renders webpages quite fast for me. And I suggest the free app called Pocket from the Playstore so you can read internet articles later offline.+ EXTERNAL SLOT FOR MICRO SD CARD up to 64GB - This is no real change over the Tab 3 line, but still it is a must for me as I keep my personal files, photos, and music on my internal SD card. Note that this was one of the deciding factors that sold me on this tablet.+ Camera / Video Camera - The front camera is now 8MP which is much better than then older Tab 2 and Tab 3 lines. And I took pictures inside and outside and they came out very SHARP and VERY CLEAR! So I am impressed with the camera!And I took some videos inside and outside to test this and they are much clearer and better resolution than on my Tab 2 tablet.+ Home Videos - The stock video player is OK and plays MOST home videos, however, may I suggest QQ Player (Free App from Playstore and the ONLY one I recommend as it plays every home video I tried).+ Reading/Creating/Editing Word, Excel, Text Files and much more on this tablet: This comes with a So So Office app (viewer) for reading Office documents, however, I STILL prefer Kingsoft Office which is a free app from Playstore. It is the best I have ever tried and I am very picky about so called Office programs. It is very compatible with MS Office as it reads, edits and creates Office files and reads PDF files, and it has more features of any other Android Office program that I tried. This app is a MUST have for tablet owners in my opinion.+ Music Player/Sound Quality - Stock player has clear sound through the outside \"speakers\" and very clear using headphones. To sync easily with Windows Media Player may I suggest the Playstore app free) WinAmp for the tablet as it is very highly rated and the sound is good, but I use a very high quality Bluetooth speaker for great sound! Suggestions: The best way to really enjoy music is through a high quality Bluetooth speaker or Bluetooth headset as the sound quality is superb this way and you can walk about your home listening to your music!+ Battery Life- Since I have done a few tweaks on this tablet, now I have found that my battery life is better than the first and even the second day. In fact, the battery life now I find that when I use WiFi just when I need it, I now get about 6 to 8 hours with it(this reflects 100 percent brightness however). Still this is better than I received on my older Tab 2, so I am happy.***Where battery life is concerned: To make your battery last as long as possible is to be sure to turn off BLUETOOTH AND WIFI when you do not need these. Both are these are memory hogs! Also, I turn off my GPS and even SYNC sometimes to conserve battery and then turn them on later.+ OTG USB Compatible - You can add an optional OTG (On the Go adapter cable to the Micro port for copying files to your flash drive and from your flash drive to the Tab Pro). You can also plug in a mouse, I tried it and it worked. *Note that portable external hard drives and portable DVD/CD drives will not work using OTG in the Tab Pro because these both require a lot of power to be compatible with the Tab Pro and most tablets that have the OTG. However, it is still good to know that you can easily plug in your flash drive and copy files to the Tab Pro and from Tab Pro to PC--what a time-saver. I have written an article on OTG and how to use it, just request this in the comments.+ Bluetooth Speed and Performance - The Bluetooth keyboard I own (generic OKA) paired quickly with several devices and copied files at a great rate of speed. Speaking of Bluetooth: Also there will be Bluetooth keyboards out for the Tab Pro coming soon. (Just make sure you purchase one for JUST THE TAB Pro 10.1 size).+ Lighter Weight - This is very light and easy to carry, the weigh is just about the same as iPad Air.CONS:- No support for Flash Videos - Adobe does not support flash in any Android tablets this days. This non support is for all Android tablets, not just Samsung tablets. + Watching Flash Videos - This device does not come with installed flash, however, I found a workaround to solve this. So if you request it in the comments, I will send you instructions on how to installed Archived Flash so you can watch flash videos and what proper browsers I recommend for this tablet...The only browser that I could get the Archived Flash to play on and well was Puffin Browser for 2.99 in the Playstore. (I tried Maxthon, FoxFire Beta and more and this was the only one that played consistently flash videos).**Here is what I do to watch videos: I use free Playstore apps as YouTube, Netflix, CBS.COM and more and open up the app instead of going to the browser to watch videos that I want to. They play fine in an APP rather than in a Browser.******* Need a tablet with 3G/Phone and Data that cost less than the Pro? There is the Tab 3 10.1 with 3G and a phone and data in it the P5200 model in white or brown. The P5200 Tab 3 10.1 is 90 dollars less than this Pro and you can make phone calls with it, use your data plan as it accepts an activated GSM Micro Sim card. Having a tablet with phone and data capabilities I have found are great, especially when you cannot find a WiFi hotspot when traveling!- No installed Adobe Flash (This can be fixed by installing an Archived Adobe Flash from Adobe website. And I did so and now I can watch flash videos using Puffin Paid browser. (No new Android tablets or phones come with flash, but the Archived Adobe Flash can be installed). Most flash videos play OK with this older Archived Flash, with the exception of Amazon videos (as of March 30, 2014).If you have questions about this tablet, I will be happy to answer any questions you may have through the comment section.", "Date": "February 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great tablet, few flaws", "Author": "Would-be-box-man", "ReviewID": "R21OGXW8J7A23E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "*****EDIT: As promised, I just received my case and it fit perfectly -- it does look like cases for the Galaxy Note 10.1\" 2014 Edition (make absolute sure you pick the 2014 Edition, not an earlier model) work precisely the same. The case I got was the MoKo leather case, though there are plenty of options out there.*****UPDATED EXPERIENCE: I'm a big, big fan after a week of ownership -- particularly the screen and sound, both of which surprised me with their clarity. I did note that a lot of app developers were not ready for the 4.4.2 version, so there's minor tweaking of a number of apps in order to get back to full operation; I expect those problems will be filtered out in the next few weeks at most. One thing I am nervous about is regarding how the screen is going to look in bright light, but most tablets are going to be in good company in that regard.First, as a background, let me divulge that my background with tablets has primarily been the iPad (3rd Generation), which I absolutely loved. I recently made the switch from an iPhone to the Galaxy S4, and I found the change quite likable, so I awaited a new tablet announcement that met my need. This did that quite a bit, though I'm sure MWC at the end of the month will release quite a few more like-wise tablets.PERFORMANCE/EXPERIENCE THUS FAR: Fantastic. It works incredibly quick, has smooth transitions, and looks absolutely gorgeous -- I don't know what they did to the screen, but it's a beast. I can't say I cared particularly too much for the Magazine UX (the on-the-top-of-TouchWiz-interface), but that was easily fixable with a launcher (as I did with my S4 as well). Also, the dang tablet is incredibly light.QUIRKS: I don't understand why, but when you hold down the Home button, it goes to Google Search rather than the multi-task menu (as on the S4). Instead, they did a swap of sorts: the old menu button (to the left of the home button) was replaced by the multitask window, and holding down the Home button will get you Google Search. As to the why, I couldn't possibly fathom.ONLY CON: Depending on the task and what brightness you're using, the battery can drain pretty quick. I gave the ladyfriend my old iPad, and myself the Tab Pro. It took two and a half hours to drain my battery from 100% to 77% (roughly 9.5-10ish battery life), but in the same time period, her iPad had only gone down to 93% (which I'd usually have two days of heavy usage out of). The Tab Pro *is* a more powerful device, as shown by the battery consumption, but I'd advise toning down the brightness waaaaaay down if, say, you have a long day of traveling ahead of you.", "Date": "February 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love it!

All the TabPROs are same resolution,  so we increase in size, the pixel density decreases. The videos were very crisp and text so sharp. The new Magazine UX interface makes the screen really pop. I was able to read magazines very easily. Aldiko and many libraries have teamed up and magazines can be checked out through the app. Resolution will blow you away. Reading magazine and pdf files are easier in 10.1in than 8\".PROCESSING POWER:Exynos\u00ae 5 Octa (1.9GHz Quadcore + 1.3 GHz Quadcore),2 GB RAM, Powerful for what it does. I have played games/watched youtube videos and have seen no lag or any latencies. Though the chip is octa core, do bear in mind only 4 cores are active at a time. This is done for minimizing heat.PRO MEANS?Tablet is certainly is a productivity tool. The TabPro series has free subscriptions to popular services such as Hulu Plus, Dropbox, Bloomberg Businessweek+, and Cisco WebEx Premium for varying times. It also has Hancom office suite which is an office suite developer in Korea. Hancom Office consists of Hanword, Hancell (Spreadsheet), and Hanshow (Presentation program). Since there is Google office, I don't know if this will be any market in the US and other countries.STORAGE:This model is for 16 GB tablets. Samsung does make 32 GB internationally, and will most likely appear in Amazon later.  Having the expandable memory to 64 GB is the greatest invention since sliced bread. Well, putting bunch of video/audio/books on the SD card which is so cheap these days, the tablet suddenly has more memory with no lag observed.  With prices plummeting for 64 GB cards, it is a great boon. Put all your music, books, photos on the SD card and you have a powerful computer in hand always! I personally use the 64 GB microSD card on my mobile devices. Get this mobileUltra (SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 6 Memory Card with SD Adapter - Retail Packaging.CAMERA:Having a tablet is a plus on smaller tablets, though I hate the feature on 10 or 12\" tablets.  I personally don't use cameras as much on 10\"+. If you use publicly, it is like having a big magazine in front of you. Imagine the guy in the sports stand using in front of you! The resolution is 8MP Rear + 2MP Front. Video is 1080p 60 fps. Nowadays there is nothing much to say of cameras, they just work for the required purpose.ERGONOMICS:I personally like for home uses 8\", but for work 10\" is good. At 469 gm, the weight is definitely not single hand holdable.  Size of this tablet is 9.57 x 6.75 x 0.29 in. The battery is 8200 mAh battery. The best part I liked is the beautiful resolution and is the best resolution on a tablet! HD videos are crisp.SOUND:Excellent sound system with stereo speakers and microphone. I was able to ask questions to Google Now and get precise answers.MISC:I tested OTG capability and it is great to have a external USB support.  USB Host is one of the most undernoticed features of Androids and is in my opinion one of the best features compared to iPad lines. What this means you get a USB Host cable also otherwise called OTG (On the Go) cables and plug in your USB thumb drive or other USB devices and the device recognizes it. I have used it with Alfa AWUS036H for a wireless project with Android PCAP Capture from reputable Kismet wireless.Having a GPS is great for immediate needs and I could get immediate lock on this tablet. Wi-Fi is 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, dual-band. Also has infrared which can be used for WatchON as a TV remote control. Worked straightaway on Samsung TV. This is also great for sharing your tablet with family members, multi user mode lets different users log in separately, so you each see only your own apps, backgrounds, and email.APP POWER:I tried following apps and they just worked awesome. A tablet is only as good as the apps you have and how productive it makes you. It's almost like the camera/lens analogy in the DSLR space. What good it is to have a great DSLR body if you have no good lens? Same with Tablet body and apps you have.WolframAlpha (I can go on for hours praising this.

Phillips \"tx.parrothead\"", "ReviewID": "R14OJ2RVH3RIAC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "One of the primary reasons I like Samsung tablets is the support for external SD cards, allowing you to store your pictures, music, books, etc. on an easily removable device.  For that reason, I was EXTREMELY disappointed to find that Samsung has caved in to Google on the issue of file access on external SD cards. In case you are wondering what I mean, it's this. Beginning with this tablet and the Samsung implementation of Android 4.4 (Kitkat)it uses, your external SD card files can no longer be modified by any app on your tablet/phone, other than the app that \"owns\" the file. For example, if you use your external SD card to store photos, you can't edit them, crop, delete, etc. KitKat will not allow it. The same applies to music and books.  I always used Syncme to keep my books and music on my SD card in sync with my PC wirelessly. Now Kitkat will not allow it. I would say this is annoying, but it is way beyond that. The bad part is, Samsung could have chosen not to implement this behavior, but they did not. Had I known this before my purchase, I probably would have chosen different device with another version of Android.

I think the screen is more vibrant on this tablet and the text is slightly more crisp thanks to the higher pixel density. If you are in the market for a high end tablet this is the answer to all your needs, unless you can't live without the app store.

I had no problems at all. The display was beautiful, the processor fast, the interface user friendly. I own a Kindle Paperwhite, so I had no need to use this as a reader, but video and sound quality were terrific and playing games was a blast with the great touch screen. The leather backing looked classy, not cheap, and it was really light. Having bought the item on something of a whim, though, I spent the next 10 days researching reviews. Ultimately, I realized that the features that make this tablet \"PRO\" are business apps I will never use and a weight comparable to that of the iPad Air. Since I put the device in a case, anyway, the light weight didn't mean much to me.Best Buy guaranteed the return of the tablet for any reason, within 15 days. After reading enough of these reviews, I realized that the extra gig of ram and the S pen included with the Note 10.1 2014 Edition were far more valuable to me, personally, than the lighter weight, slimmer appearance, and business apps. Fortunately, the devices are so similar that I didn't have to return my case. It's a matter of personal needs and if you're looking for a tablet to use for professional purposes that require electronic group meetings and presentations, or something super lightweight, this is a GREAT device. If you're wanting something for fun and personal use, I'd recommend the extra gig of ram and S pen that comes with the Note 10.1 2014.", "Date": "February 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Perfect size, perfect weight, the android equivalent of the IPAD air", "Author": "Homer \"consumer\"", "ReviewID": "R11QBKILMW2A7K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just received this product. It comes in a simple box and has enough juice to start up immediately.I was waiting for Google to release a new tablet with a basic Android interface as I am a huge fan and user of the Nexus 7. However, in my opinion, the wait is over for all of those who have been on the fence, waiting for Google to announce a new tablet.This device is, in my opinion, the next Android tablet that beats the others. It is, on initial evaluation, without any current equal.On start up it immediately goes into settings which take only a minute to complete. I am a Google user, so I entered my account and it downloaded all of my apps that I have installed on my other Google accounts.I also use a Microsoft exchange e-mail. It installed, downloaded my contacts and calendar.I am a user of the Nexus 7, and a Samsung Note 3 cell phone. So, I am very familiar and happy with the Android/Samsung environment.This device is absolutely flawless and present. Great screen, incredible clarity, and the touch screen responds as quickly as the Nexus 7.The new interface is somewhat different, but I actual like the fact that when I open it, it shows me my calendar, e-mails and the news. It can be changed to include more or less.I have used the Nexus for almost 6 months, wishing there was a larger device with up to date hardware and software. Well, this device is fast and handles every app and function without a hiccup. It has never hesitated or had a slow response rate. No freezes or any complaints. The touchscreen has an instant response. There is no evidence of any response problem.I did install the new Hancom and my first impression are good. Microsoft documents opened without a hitch.I was not able to get the free Bloomberg download to download. Not certain if the server is overwhelmed as it comes from the Samsung site.It also comes with free inflight GOGO for one year, which I will use... and hulu, which I could live without. Sirius radio for three months if you don't already have a subscription.The WIFI seems very good. I was able to connect throughout my area without any loss of signal or drops.The weight and size is almost identical to the IPAD air, Easy to hold and use.So, easy setup, new but nice touchwiz interface, good WIFI, light as the IPAD Air but with Android and it looks great.I did consider that this does not have the  S pen. However, this device is lighter than the 10.1 Note, and the typewriter on the screen is \"THE BEST\" I have ever used. Great touch and feel. Great haptic feedback.So, call me very pleased.The Nexus 7 is going to be used by other household members.

Both devices use the same Samsung account for stream-lining the automatic installation of apps and settings.I needed a tablet where I can set up multiple profiles to easily log into multiple email addresses, linkedIn accounts, facebook accounts, etc. The Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1 has been absolutely perfect for my needs - this has been the best tablet I have ever owned (several) or used (many).

Here\u2019s what I like about it:1. Setup: Setup was drop dead easy. I have a Samsung Note II phone and once I logged into my account via the tablet it synched with my account and downloaded all the apps I had setup on my phone. The wizard steps were simple and easy to follow. Connecting to wi-fi worked first time as well as all the other configuration settings.2. Operating System: If you know any android system device you know this tablet. Although tailored somewhat for the Galaxy the overall look and feel is pretty similar between Android devices. No problems there. Ease of use is great. I was up and playing Candy Crush 15 minutes after I opened the box.3. Hardware: The footprint of this tablet is the smallest yet so if you have a case for a prior Samsung 10.1 tablet (as I did), it won\u2019t work.  There aren\u2019t a lot of cases available for this model yet and the ones that are available are pretty plain and, depending on where you shop, over-priced. The charging port has changed from earlier models (my wife has a 2nd generation Galaxy tablet) and it\u2019s now a mini-USB plug. This is a plus as it means my existing phone chargers work with this tablet. The picture is bright and exceptionally sharp and the gorilla glass looks to be the best yet at being able to easily clean off smudges.Overall I would say this is an excellent device and very handy for a quick connect for web research or just casual browsing.

I played heavy games for about 2-3 hours and only about 20-30% was wasted(with a lowered brightness). The only thing that really annoyed me and if I had known would have made me not buy this tablet was controller support...there is NONE. My nexus 7 detects and already supports xbox 360 controllers, so it really is just plug and play, and it works as it should(full support for analog sticks, trigger buttons, etc.) However, on this tablet, this is not so, when you connect the controller, it will just blink the green lights forever with no response at all from buttons, you need to purchase an app that will detect your controller(usb/bt joystick center) and even then it doesn't work as an xbox controller but instead as a generic IME device where you have to map buttons, this is a problem for games and emulators because you have to do different mappings for different games and emulators will not detect the analog sticks as actual analog sticks and trigger buttons as trigger buttons, but only as mapped keys(a problem if you want to use epsxe for android as it only lets you map axis, but not other emulated mappings)...In other words, NO native support for gamepads is a hassle on this tablet, but other than that, I guess it is a pretty good tablet for the other various things tablets do.", "Date": "May 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best purchase I've made in a long time", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Promgoers Mom\"", "ReviewID": "R3SM9K6Y1BBAZ5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first tablet and I am happy that I waited to get it!

It,  and the back button and the active apps button,  do not follow when the device is held in the portrait orientation.

The design, display and build quality of the Tab pro is great, but unfortunately, the Touchwiz UI ruins it for me.

In my case, it pulls most of its content from Flipboard so when I open something from Magazine UX it launches in Flipboard and I end up going back and forth.  Could save myself a lot of time and tapping if I just launch flipboard to begin with. I would just turn Magazine UX off but you can't so it is always there as you swipe through the home screens.My other two complaints; there is about a one second lag from the time you click the power button to the time it actually comes on and when streaming audio via bluetooth, the volume is very low and there isn't much base.

Packed with Features & Can Multitask - There is A Lot To Love About this Tablet.", "Author": "Carrie", "ReviewID": "R3IAP562PRCBLX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Samsung Galaxy Pro 10.1 is one of the nicest Android tablets on the market & is a tablet a business user should consider.  Unlike its 8.4 sibling, the 10.1 has a Samsung Exynos 5 octa processor so that it can handle multitasking with ease.  There are still a few annoying things, especially if you use Windows for business. All in all, however, the positives outweigh the negatives, and, for light business use, the Galaxy Tab 10.1 is a strong contender in the tablet arena.What to Love:1. Bright, clear display2. Easy to set up/intuitive3. Quickly downloaded my contact information (from outlook/hotmail)4. Expansion slot allows for a 64GB microSD card5. Lightweight & thin (for a 10.1)6. Decent battery life7. Easy to connect to wifi8. Decent rear/back camera9. Can split windows/open multiple windows10. Did a good, quick job of transferring large files from folder to folder, USB or SD card to tablet folderCould be better:1. Gmail emails are in a different folder/app than other emails (hotmail, roadrunner, etc). It would be nice to have them together.2. Need to use a USB adapter in order to use a flash drive3. Have to download each HanCom App separately4. There doesn't seem to be an equivalent HanCom version of OneNote5. Have not tried, but other reports indicate that Excel Macros do not transfer to the HanCom version6. If you are using the USB adapter, you cannot charge the tablet at the same timeI did not try the tablet as a remote, but to do so, you must have or register for a Samsung account.I travelled overseas with the 8.4 tablet. While I loved the fact that the 8.4 was lightweight & very packable, I did not like the fact that it choked on large file downloads, thus eliminating one of the advantages for taking the 8.4 over the 10.1 or (my old) Surface (which is larger & heavier, but also can handle all of my required tasks).  Had I toted the 10.1, which isn't that much heavier or larger than the 8.4, I not only could have used it daily to connect to the internet for emails & social media, I could have also transferred everyone's pictures easily & quickly.  Consequently, the 10.1 is the better travel tablet for my needs.I've used a Sony Experia tablet (10\" Android), a Surface tablet (Windows) & the Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro tablets (8.4 & 10.1). Of the two Android tablets, I think the Samsung 10.1 is a superior tablet for light business use and travel.  For simple tasks - email, social media, light gaming (time killer gaming), the 8.4 tablet is a good choice. As compared to the Surface, the 10.1 Tab Pro is more lightweight, but the Surface is more functional as a business tablet because Word/Excel/Powerpoint are seamless applications.  However, for light business use (reading files, small file edits), the Galaxy's HanCom suites work well and can handle simple Word/Excel/Powerpoint files. Keep in mind that the HanCom version is not the complete version, so certain items may be lacking (ie, Excel's macros).Scorecard:Sony Experia: good for email, social media, light gamingSamsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4: good for email, social media, light gaming, travel.Samsung Galazy TabPro 10.1: good for email, social media, light gaming, travel, light business useSurface: good for email, social media, light gaming, travel, light-moderate business useBetween the Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1 & the Surface, if you are a light Office Suite business user, the Tab Pro has an advantage because it is lighter & easier to carry.  The Surface is heavier, but has more business functionality (full USB port, can charge at same time as using the USB, kickstand, touch or type cover). The Samsung does not have a manufacturer created touch or type cover, and I did not do the research on after market covers.In the end, I like both the Samsung Galaxy 10.1 & the Surface.

It is light, fast and a big improvement over my Nexus 7 tablet. I gave it 5 stars but really wanted to give it 4.8 stars. Maybe I'm being nit-picky but the Nexus tablet (which my wife now uses) had a very nice feature that is missing on the PRO 10.1. When you rotate the Nexus the 'App Mgr', 'Home' and 'Back' \"buttons\" rotate with you, so you always know where they are when you need them. Not so with the Galaxy. Those \"buttons\" are fixed for landscape viewing and thus do not move when you rotate to portrait view. Not a big problem unless you (1) have several apps that only run in portrait mode and/or (2) you have a big thumb that occasionally hits one of those \"buttons\" and takes you where you were not planning to go.That being said, I do believe that the Galaxy is the way to go.

I returned the tablet to Amazon and they sent me another one. I have had this one for about 6 weeks. I have been happy with it's performance until this week. It just turns itself off randomly when I am using it while it has a 50-75% charge. You have to hold the button down for about 20 sec to get it to come back on. I contacted Samsung support and after troubleshooting they told me to return it or fill out a service request. This is a $500 tablet that is 6 weeks old. Are you kidding me?

You can pretty much stop the chase of looking at tablet specs for comparison and just move straight to the purchase phase right away!Like you, I always do a lot of research before I decide to make an investment in any new gadget because I've been burned before, but after buying this tablet, it definitely has delivered on the promise.I looked at the 12.2 inch version and the Note Pro versions, but I just could not justify the extra expense of going with any of those and so I ended up getting the 10.1 Pro tablet.

Nothing like highlighting through 40 pages of material and then being unable to save your work!

Of course most slideshows still show up closer to their original format if you use QuickOffice, which is native (and free) on all android systems.

I guess the issues is with the 2 apps and not the device since I went through trouble shooting with Samsung and that is what the recommended I do, contact Netflix and HBO.  I scoured the internet and no one else had this issue.  I don\u2019t understand.  The specs on this tablet are amazing.I was trying to get away from Apple so I first purchase the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9.  I actually loved the device,  but wanted a larger screen, Google integration, and freedom to use a different browser.  I have come to the conclusion that the IPad is the best tablet on the market and as soon as my money is credited I will purchase the IPad Air.Collin", "Date": "April 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Don't waste your money.", "Author": "Patricia Driscoll", "ReviewID": "R372UA0FJ3C44G", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Issue with tablet turning off during web searches and as I am using it.

This is exactly the same as the Galaxy Note 10.1. The only difference between these two devices is that the Note has a wacom digitzer. Why would you not get the Note instead? The wacom digitizer is fantastic and does a great job at letting you take HAND WRITTEN notes, annotate PDF's in a HAND WRITTEN fashion, draw on a high resolution screen!Why would you buy this tablet instead? There's not wacom pen support...Please do research about the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 edition before you get this!I'm currently an owner of the galaxy note 10.1 2014 edition, these two tablets look the same. The note has more ram, but the note does not have kitkat. If a tablet doesn't have a wacom digitizer then it pretty much lacks one of the most important factors of a tablet. The ability to do all the signing, writing, note taking, DIGITALLY LIKE ON A DIGITAL PIECE OF PAPER.Please, don't get this unless you've looked at galaxy note 10.1 2014 edition.Edit:Look at the pricing for both these tablets as of 2-17-14. The note 10.1 2014 edition for 16 gb is 500 dollars. It has digital pen, it has 3 gb of ram, and is 80 grams heavier. Look at the new pro tab 10.1 16 gb edition. It is also 500 dollars, NO pen support, and has 2 gb of ram. It is 80 grams lighter.Do the math in your head, you are getting less by buying this tablet. People are getting mad at this post since they are looking at this AFTER they bought the pro 10.1. And to try to make themselves justified, they throw out stupid arguments.YOU ARE GETTING LESS, IF YOU BUY THIS TABLET, PERIOD.I understand this is not a true review of the tab, this was never mean't to be. This was to inform consumers that samsung is selling two tablets at the same price, but one lacks the pen.Double Edit:Kitkat came out for the Note 10.1, so you have the same OS on both tablets now.

It should be 200$ though, seriously...", "Date": "February 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "worst tablet on the market not wort it", "Author": "arturo", "ReviewID": "R1ZDQP859K8NIK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is crap I bought this thing to enjoy social media,  you cant play any video on facebook, I was somewhat happy but this just kill it for me, there is small nick in the corner of the screen and I took it back, but they won't accept it back because of it, but the little nick was there when I opened,  I didn't care cause I was going to put a protective case anyways, but is going to Craigslist, so it doesn't matter, I will never buy another samsung product, ever again,", "Date": "June 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Amzaing Screen, poor device", "Author": "Robert Vardell", "ReviewID": "R59RZ65LH9L6U", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The screen on this device is only surpassed by the 12.2 Pro yet that cannot overcome for the performance degradation caused by the bloated OS and features added to try and bombard you with \"stuff\".

Spent two hours trying to get far enough along to look for an update on the first one but it kept crashing, with non stop force close messages and random reboots to factory settings every 30-45 seconds. Put all info back in again and ....same thing! Nightmare!Second unit to replace the first stayed on long enough to download the update 14.4mb that take almost 30 minutes on my super high speed WiFi and then hung up on a startup to \"installing updates\" logo/screen that just loops infinitely. I am soooo frustrated!I can't believe this is happening. I have never had this many problems with a tablet in my life let alone all from one! I will go back to the store one more time and if that's defective too, I give up. I desperately want this thing to work but NOTHING DOES! NOTHING.I was able to snap off a picture on the second between crash to factory reboots cycles and I can say that it was the nicest quality picture I've ever seen a tablet take....though I can't say ANYTHING else good about this frustrating piece of dissapointment.It is currently stuck in a boot installing updates cycle that will not stop. The tablet is boiling hot and will not turn off no matter what I do, I had to stick it in a metal cooking pot in case it explodes or starts on fire, this is not a joke.I am waiting for the hidden cameras to appear to see who's punked me but I'm starting to think this is reality after all. I've never seen anything so bizzare in my life, its crazier than a phone after a fresh swim in the toilet.Just a warning for what it's worth.
