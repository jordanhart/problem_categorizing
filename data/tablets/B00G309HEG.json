It comes in weighing a little over 1lb.I upgraded from the iPad 3 and you can defiantly feel the difference. When reading with the iPad 3, after a few minutes my arms would be tired of holding the iPad up. With the new iPad Air, that is not the case anymore. I can read for much longer now and my arms don't feel tired. The unit is also easier to hold (much thinner than previous versions of the iPad)It\u2019s built of high quality aluminum just like every other iPad is and constructed to last.PerformanceThe new iPad air is fast! It has an A7 processor in it which is defiantly an upgrade from the previous iPads. The Wi-Fi is even quicker to connect and I notice I can achieve more of my potential in bandwidth speed using this iPad. The new front facing camera makes video chatting much better and the M7 chip makes editing and slow motion shooting fun and a breeze.StorageI upgraded from a 16 GB iPad 3 to a 128 GB iPad Air. Why you ask? Well because I do a lot of traveling for work and Apple is notorious for sneaking in extra stuff on your hard drive that takes up space. My iPad 3 came with only 13.8 GB useable space and after a month I had 3 or 4 GB of \u201cother\u201d storage that no one could figure out how to remove or clear.I mentioned earlier I travel a lot for work so I enjoy watching movies on the plane rides. With my old iPad I never had room for all my movies I had to use a wireless hard drive  (Seagate Wireless Built In Streaming STCK1000100Just to watch my movies. Now with this new 128 GB hard drive I can fit tons of movies on it and I no longer need the old wireless hard drive. (One less thing to lose on travel)Final thought:For people who have an older iPad (like I did) then this is a no brainer buy this new iPad you won\u2019t be disappointed! It is much lighter than previous versions. Wayyy faster! And still sleek and built to last as every other iPad is. The new storage options give you the ability to carry more pictures, movies, books , games with you and the battery life is superb coming in at 10+hours. Overall I am happy with my purchase. It might be a little expensive, but if you buy smart you'll have this tablet for a long time with no problems.", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bad crashing problems, NOT ENOUGH MEMORY Major Fiasco", "Author": "P.

By Apple. If you go in their forums, there are plenty of (new users) people reporting crashing problems. Then you have the level 6 and up users denying there is a problem. Many posts are being censored and deleted by Apple.The 64 bit processor needs more memory than a 32 bit CPU - so in effect, the ipad air has LESS memory than the ipad 4.Do yourself a favor and dont buy the ipad air. It is already obsolete. If you must have an ipad, buy the 4th generation one, or wait until the next one comes out.

The specs are about the same as the New Ipad (iPad 3) and iPad 4. I would definitely get an iPad Air over an iPad Mini, even with the Retina Display, as what made the Mini desirable was the smaller weight and size. The Air is really light, more manageable for someone who uses it continuously.All in all, if you can afford it, it is a great gift, to yourself or seomone else (you really like :)).", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "iPad Review from an Android user!", "Author": "Jason Wang", "ReviewID": "R3MRBK7OU4EGHS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased as a long time android user because I needed something for textbooks and the 4:3 aspect ratio works a lot better for text books than 16:9 (I tired the Nexus 10 for a week as well)..Here is my review after  a week:The first thing I noticed was how light and compact it was, coming from the Nexus 10 I was surprised how easy it was to hold with one hand (although you still wouldn't for long periods of time) and how compact it was for a 10in tablet. The tablet is as fast as anything out right now, to be honest I don't play games but in terms of everyday use everything was fine...but at the same time every iPad that I've used before felt fast as well, I have heard of some issues with tablet optimization for iOS7 but I haven't encountered any. The screen is bright and sharp, text is really easy to read vs a higher PPI tablet (nexus 10) I really couldnt tell a difference with the extra pixels. The color on the iPad is very good once again this is to be expected as Apple always makes high quality devices.The only Cons I can't think of is the speaker placement and feel of the glass (as mentioned in other reviews). The iPad has \"stereo speakers\" which are located on the bottom, I really wish they would have put one on each side instead of both on one side. Watching youtube or netflix in landscape is kind of weird since all the side comes from the right side, kind of defeats the purpose of stereo speakers imo since I never watch fullscreen videos in portrait mode. The nexus 7and 10  have  really good desigsn for speakers that I wish Apple would've adopted.The other con is the feel of the screen, to be honest it feels a bit cheap...compared to previous iPads and the nexus devices the feel of the screen on the iPad air is the worst. It feels like plastic and it just doesnt feel solid when you push down. I'm sure this is a sacrifice that Apple had to make in order to reduce the weight to me the benefits of having a lighter, smaller device outweigh the feel of the screen (something that I'll eventually get used to).Other notes: I haven't used the camera, sorry but I never use the camera on a tablet to take pictures but from what I hear from reviews it takes pretty much what you would expect from a camera on a tablet. I probably wouldn't upgrade if I had an iPad 3 or iPad 4 unless your someone who has to have the newest tech or is absolutely miserable with the weight.If you do want to purchase it you can get it for 479.99 + Tax, go to Walmart's website or you can have any other retailer price match it.All in all this is an excellent tablet besides the minor gripes...the only Android tablet I can see competing with the iPad is the Nexus 10 v2 if it ever comes out...and while I preferred the Nexus 10 for media viewing, real stereo speakers and OS, reading textbooks felt a little cramped and since I'm using this tablet primarily for \"school\" the 4:3 factor fit my needs better.So there it is proof that you can be a fan of both Android and iOS :)", "Date": "November 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Experience", "Author": "Dragember", "ReviewID": "R3RZ0F8IARVY1A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My first tablet was a Nexus 7, and while I enjoyed it immenseilly I was ultimately disappointed in how slow it eventually got (speedy at Christmas, snail slow come April despite factory reset and other attempts to speed it up. Bought my brother a new nexus 7 that summer only to discover its speed was on par with the Nexus I currently owned. Very bizarre). I was skeptical whether or not I would enjoy a tablet experience, so the Nexus 7 was none the less a great first tablet. It could do anything any other tablet could without putting a dent in your pocket.I decided to get the iPad Air this season, specifically the wifi 32gb space gray version.Never owned an iPad before, so I can't really tell you how the models compare,However some things I note, the screen is rather large (duh) which does make typing with the onscreen keyboard difficult. However the screen real estate and quality is stunning, and if typing is a huge issue for you there is the iPad mini and other tablets. That's the trade off, and this is always a choice you have to make between 10 inch vs. 7inch tablets, no matter what brand you're looking at.The glass does feel rather thin, and I am concerned about its durability. I have read that the screen is durable however, and this perception is due to the lightening of the device causing the screen to sound thinner. Supposedly I will be able to confirm this with a case, as the addition of the case will give the tapping of the screen a deeper sound. Apparently it all comes down to acoustics - though a specification on glass thickness versus previous models would be nice.The design of the tablet is exquisite, definitely some top of the line material choices. The tablet has a VERY sturdy feel.Lots of free apps come with this tablet, which all work excellently and efficiently. There is no hesitation between tasks, and the speed is phenomenal.Overall I noticed the quality of apps and how they work on the operating system is MUCH better with apple than it was with android. However, the apple App Store isn't very easy to navigate. Google store is much more user friendly.No widgets, makes customizabibility limited.Multitasking is an ease with this tablet due to gestures. I love how well the gestures work. You can swipe between apps.Battery lasts insanely long, mine averages 12 hours of use.Hasn't overheated (vague warmth can be felt), even with gameplay.Sound from speakers at bottom of iPad sound full. Other tablets I've played with have a tin-metal quality sound emit from them, as though the speakers strain to emit a hearable noise.All iPad Airs, according to Apple's website, come with a complimentary one year limited warranty.Cool front AND back microphones work together to cancel out noise when using skype and FaceTime. Sounds very clear and crisp, I recommend you check out some videos on it.Overall I would say an A+ tablet. I mainly listed some concerns and observations, but that aside this thing is amazing! I love and, it from what I've heard of previous models, I'll hopefully be using this tablet for years to come (number one selling point for me is that apple devices function excellently passed a year).Update December 3, 2013:I've noticed a bizarre memory leak that occurs whenever I watch videos using Apple's video app (love them digital copies). I was testing the video streaming and after I noticed entire GBs were gone! After shutting down the app and fiddling around I realized that the iPad stores memory it buffers and keeps it hostage. However, after going back to the app and quickly loading the same movie and exiting before it begins to buffer the memory reappears. That being said, I wouldn't be surprised that if you watched movies completely through your memory would be restored each time. Still this is a rather large flaw on Apple's part, and I'm not sure if it occurs with any of the other video streaming apps. I'll be sending them a message to see if they're working on a patch for it.", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best tablet just got better", "Author": "G.

Three and a half years later, the release of the iPad Air, the fifth full-size tablet Apple has offer, has been much calmer. This is the fourth full-size iPad I have owned, beginning with the AT&T; 3G model which was released in May, 2010, about a month after the first WiFi only iPads arrived. Every one of my iPads has had an AT&T; cellular data.Until this model I have purchased the largest capacity solid state drive Apple has offered. This year there is a 128GB iPad, which costs about $100 more than my 64GB model. Here is the reason I did not select the higher capacity-iCloud. Data stored on iCloud is instantly available across multiple IOS and OSX devices. With all that storage (I buy 50GBs annually) why duplicate it on a hard disk?The iPad Air is incredibly light(about a pound) and has a slightly smaller external footprint than previous models. The retina display actually seems sharper, if such a thing is possible. It also holds a charge for even longer than before.Beyond the physical beauty of the iPad Air is its amazing utility. As a trial lawyer I can easily access the firm's network. This means that  every file and every document is instantly at my command. In just a few years time I have learned that I no longer need to drag loads of paper files and depositions with me to court.Over 400,000 apps are built exclusively for iPad, and well over a million iPhone apps run on my device as well. It is an incredibly powerful platform, well on its way to replacing laptops for all but the most labor intensive tasks. When I travel, I typically bring only my iPad-no laptop, no hard copy of a file.  I didn't really appreciate just how dependent I had become on the iPad until this June when a federal judge held that  I could bring  either a laptop or a tablet into the courthouse. I chose the iPad.My weapon of choice-the iPad. This is the one tablet to buy if you are serious about using a tablet.

For something I use everyday, like a tablet, it really is worth the investment. As powerful as a computer, but an absolute dream to use. The iPad Air now comes with the feature-rich word processor and spreadsheets apps, called Pages and Numbers. With included cloud-based collaborative features that can even be accessed from a PC.While there may be cheaper tablets on the market, you certainly get what you pay for.

I have a Samsung Galaxy Note Tab 2 and right away I noticed the weight of the iPad Air. It felt like a feather compared to my tablet. The display is crisp and VERY sharp, I was amazed by that. The only thing she had an issue with compared to my tablet, was that the speakers on the iPad are placed at the bottom and not on the front facing you, like it is on the Galaxy Tab. We turned it up all the way and it definitely gets loud, so it's not like the speakers aren't good. It's a minor gripe for an overall great tablet experience.

I also have a motorola xoom and it doesn't even come close to the ease of use and just generally aesthetics of this ipad.  Its probably best that I break it down into pros and cons to give the most accurate picture I can of what I have found since I bought myself, my wife and my son all the new ipad Airs.--The Good--The business apps I use are all exactly what I hoped for.  I use Chrome for browser and it looks incredible.  When tablets came out, this is what I imagined browsing the internet should look like on a tablet.  The form factor is great, and the Air is as light as advertised.  Despite other's claims of durability issues, I have found it to be quite durable even with my minimal case.  Movies in correct format play flawlessy and my music sounds great.  Paired with some good headphones, long plane trips become tolerable in the worst of seats.  Facetiming with family is a breeze and the 'cool' factor is definitely still present.--The Bad--There are also some cons which I think takes the Air down a half star to a star.  First off the 16GB model which I purchased for my wife from a big box store after I purchased my 64GB from Amazon is simply not enough memory.  I know thats a choice etc but for those that are purchasing for the first time, do NOT buy the 16 GB model unless you plan on mostly using for browsing the internet.  Apps + music + movies will fill up your 16 (actually less after what IOS takes up) gigs very quickly.Second, they should have put a little more RAM in.  The browser occaisonally crashes and there is definitely some latency on scrolling for more content intensive pages.Lastly a few random complaints; the screen also seems dimmer than the ipad with retina (last generation), there is no additional storage, and there seems to be a growing number of junk apps/games.--The Ugly--I will preface this with this: only power users are likely to encounter the ugly.Synching with Apple TV is not as easy as advertised.  Sometimes the air icon shows up, sometimes it doesn't.You can play MKV files but it is painful.  You need a third party player, then you have to transfer movies via http (drag and drop doesn't work), and you will not see where that space went, should you forget about things you've transferred via that method.If you have a home media server and use a PC, itunes + network drives + adding files to the ipad reminds me of the days of the 2400 baud modem.  You wait, and you wait, and you wait.  Anything you really want to transfer, transfer it from your network drive to your pc, then add to library, then transfer to ipad.--Overall--I still prefer this to my android pad or any other tablets I have encountered. The pros outweigh the cons if you have the money to spend considering how much more these are than comperable android tablets.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wifes Toy", "Author": "victor a. quaranta jr", "ReviewID": "RMRD11B7V8WY8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife is very thrifty and seldom ask for anything.

Figuring what you want to know is, \"Is it worth the upgrade?\"Well yes and no.If you are already using an iPad with a retina display (and the display IS pant-wettingly gorgeous), you're going to get a sleeker, lighter, faster version of the same thing. Sure, the camera is a bit improved, but don't you think that people look odd trying to take photos on an iPad? For me, that's not what this is designed for.The first thing you'll notice when you pick it up is how sleek and light it is compared to previous models. It really is a beautifully designed and built tablet. It' also noticeably (but not hugely with the apps I tested) faster. iOS 7 looks fab on the thing.Still, the bottom line is, if you are running a pre-retina iPad and you got the cash, yes, it's worth it (and I use 'worth' as a loose term here, they are bloody expensive). If you are running a newer iPad, sure, this is sleeker and shinier, but I'm afraid it's not going to change your life.To conclude, this thing is beautiful, extremely useful in my life, and I love it like the child I never had :-) Just don't expect it to change your whole life!", "Date": "November 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "iPad Air was a great buy!

I have both the HDX 8.9 and the Air even though the HDX 8.9 has a better screen, I prefer reading books and magazines on the iPad Air because of the 4:3 aspect ratio.  I also am happy that I got it because it is apparently the only tablet that works on my company's internal network.The HDX 8.9 is better for video watching, particularly if you're watching without headphones.  The speakers on it are amazing.  However, the speakers on the Air aren't bad, they're  just too close together to practically be stereo.That said, both the HDX 8.9 and the Air are 5-star tablets.

M. Kahn \"Gizmo Lover\"", "ReviewID": "R3QIG90IQFIVZV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had first purchased the iPad when it first came out, wasn't impressed and returned it.  Bought the 2nd version, loved it and have had it ever since.  When they came out with the 3rd version I wasn't impressed with the changes so I kept my iPad 2.  Ditto when they came out with the next version.  But I saw the iPad Air in person and had a chance to try it for myself.  I loved the new camera (much more defined pictures) and the screen definition (it's now hi-def).  Beautiful sharp, clear colors.  So I upgraded and bought it (I bought the white one though.)  I was fortunate that the place I bought the iPad Air from accepted my iPad 2 as a trade in so I got it for approximately $200 less (my iPad was in immaculate condition and I still had the box, paperwork and the accessories.)  I do love this iPad.  It's fast, fast, fast and my games are beautiful.  I have both Microsoft and Apple products (although no Apple computers, they're too expensive.)  Both have their merits, but I have to say one thing for the Apple products, upgrading to new devices and transferring all your programs, particularly games, is so much easier.  On Microsoft products, with Windows, you have to reinstall all of your games and programs, and with the games pray that the new operating system will let you play your old games.  In most cases it won't and you have to go through a bunch of iterations to play them (and I say this while typing on an HP Laptop which I use daily and would rather DIE than go without it!)  I don't know why Microsoft, (maybe it's the game developers) won't let you back up your games or the programs like Excel, Word, etc (even though you've already paid for them.)  But with Apple you just attach it to your computer  and sync it (hopefully you backed up your iPad, or whatever, to it) and voila, all your previous games, music, programs are on the Apple product ready to use just where you left off (most of the time anyway.  On a few of the games I had to start from the beginning, but I think that's because of the developer, not the iPad because some of them I did start where I left off.)  Also, set up for programs such as mail is minimal (just put in your user name and password and you're ready to go.)  I wish Microsoft would come out with something like that so I could purchase a new computer without the fear of not being able to play my favorite games.  Anyway, bottom line I LOVE my new iPad Air.  I even found a case that allows me to swivel the stand to either landscape or portrait positions so that I can read the newspaper or books on it and eat at the same time without having to try and prop it up on something (bought the case on Amazon.com, it's a Targus Versavu).", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Incredibly light, fast and beautiful. Is it the best tablet for you?", "Author": "John Ryan", "ReviewID": "R3W2AOZWQH82BD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The new iPad Air is Apple's latest, slimmest, lightest release of their hand-held computer. Oddly enough, it's so beautifully easy to use (my one year old daughter loves playing with it), it's almost doesn't feel like a computer at all.A word of warning - this review is written for people who've never owned an iPad before - and are wondering what all the fuss is about. If you're thinking of upgrading skip down to the \"What's great about the Air\" section below, or just buy it - it's amazing.Just what's all the fuss about?--------------------------------------I used to own a laptop for work, and (very occasionally), it'd sit on my lap on the sofa, and I'd use it for pleasure (eMail, watching films or playing the odd game). Then I bought my first iPad, and the laptop became redundant, a boring \"work device\". Hard to explain, but the fact the iPad is so small and light, and you navigate around with your finger by pointing and gently swiping the screen makes the whole experience a lot easier - a lot more fun.Even my most \"luddite\" of friends have been won over.It's incredibly simple and easy to use (it only has one main button), and everyone from my one year old daughter to my 85 year old dad have taken to without problems. It's size and shape also support using it like a book (literally to read a book or web page), but you can also watch TV and films.Personally I'm also paranoid about my password getting \"hacked\", and someone running up a huge Amazon bill or buying stuff with my credit card on eBay. Well one of the benefits of the iPad (and iPhone) is it's \"almost impossible\" to get a virus - one of the most common ways to get hacked. This doesn't mean you shouldn't use strong passwords, (both Sony and Adobe got hacked), but it's reassuring to leave the Windows world behind.Finally, I love the way these devices (iPad, iPhone, Apple TV, Apple Mac), increasingly work together. The fact you can start a Pages document on your Mac and edit it on your iPad, or take photos on the iPhone, and in seconds see them on the iPad or Mac and display them on the Apple TV.The thing is, \"it just works\".What would you use if for?----------------------------------* Shopping online. Obviously - you could be reading a review on Amazon about the iPad Air!* Reading web pages. As you can hold it like a book it's great to read the news online (my wife loves the Daily Mail Online).* Reading Books. It's great for reading books from Amazon Kindle or Apple Books with the benefit of 1,000s of online book reviews* Navigating web pages. Instead of clicking with a mouse, you gently swipe your fingers on screen to scroll around* Watching Films. I use it to watch Netflix online videos (with an Apple TV you can send stuff to the telly)* Watching TV. With the free BBC iPlayer app you can catch up or download BBC programs* Reading and replying to mail. I use \"mailbox\" a great free app to read and reply to mails, but there's a free one included* Showing and organising photos. Any photos on an iPhone are automatically available within minutes in \"the cloud\"* Playing games. From fun puzzle games like \"Cut the Rope\" to fully fledged first person shooters.* Listening to the Radio. With \"Tune in Radio\" you can listen to thousands of radio stations world-wide.* Listening to music. I stream mine to an Apple TV, but you can also buy portable speakers or just plug into the AUX socket* Editing Word, Excel and Powerpoint documents using FREE App \"QuickOffice\" (owned and supported by Google).* Editing Pages, Numbers and Keynote documents (Office for the Apple) on the FREE Apple apps.* The list goes on and on.Update: You can edit Word, Excel and Powerpoint documents (plus Pages, Numbers and Keynote) on the iPad (although I'd recommend an external keyboard - see below). It's definately powerful enough, although I'd not expect these apps to cope with REALLY complex document layouts. Great for general letter and document writing though.Which model should I buy?----------------------------------I can't comment about Android tablets (apart from the Google Nexus 7 which is well regarded), but in terms of the Apple tablet line-up in order of cost:-1. Avoid the Apple iPad 2, it's a relatively old model, under-powered and with a lower resolution screen. If you really want an Apple but don't want to spend the cash, buy a 16g WIFI 3rd or 4th generation iPad from eBay. Avoid this one.2. iPad mini is a lovely tablet. A 7.9 inch screen and astonishingly light and remarkably thin - it feels like a light-weight book.3. iPad mini with retina screen. Again 7.9 inch screen, but with the blazingly fast A7 chip and a \"retina\" (high definition) screen. Worth the upgrade if you can afford it.4. iPad Air. Much larger screen size (9.7 inches - doesn't sound much but it makes a huge difference). Same fast (A7) chip as the Mini with Retina - the latest and fastest iPad available.Clearly (from my viewpoint) there's only really three options. The iPad Mini, the Mini with retina screen and Air.What are the Optional add-ons?-----------------------------------------Well, assuming you've dropped by the Apple Store or John Lewis (which I would highly recommend), and handled the iPad Mini (with/without retina screen), and iPad Air then your options are around memory size and cellular option.Memory: Once bought, you can't add memory (space for apps, films, books etc). However, the basic price goes up a huge amount (+\u00a380 for the 16g to 32g iPad Air). But, having owned a 16g and then a 32g iPad - I can safely recommend the 16g unless you really want to store a huge amount of videos and downloads. Only you can decide, and if you're lucky enough that money is no object then splash out. Otherwise, 16g should be fine for most people.Celular: Allows you to connect to the internet while you're out and about. This will add an additional +\u00a3100 to the price and means you can slip in a mobile phone SIM card. This means (for an additional \u00a37-15 a month extra), you can access the internet on the move. Alternatively, you can opt for the WIFI option, and use it at home or at at \"hot spot\" (eg. Starbucks, most rail stations and hotels etc).Personally I'd buy (and indeed did), the 16Gb iPad Air WIFI.Do I need anything else?-------------------------------Most people (me included) buy a cover. Apple (and now several copy-cats) make a \"smart-cover\" which automatically shuts down the iPad when you close it, and switches it on when you open it. There's versions which cover the back, or just the screen. Apple charge from \u00a335 to \u00a365 for their (admittedly) high quality fabric or leather covers, but there's many available from \u00a310. Be aware, you do get what you pay for.Personally,I think it's a pity to cover the beautiful aluminium industrial design of the iPad with a cover - but if you've spent hundreds of pounds you'll want to protect it from scrapes and bangs.I also invested in a keyboard (\u00a325-80), as I tend to write a lot of mails and documents (remember it comes with a word processor). I'd recommend the Logitech Ultra Thin iPad Air Case with Keyboard - Space Greyand the ZAGG Keys iPad Air Case Folio with Backlit Keyboard - Black although these are strictly optional unless you want to use your iPad as a proper laptop.Finally, if you have another Apple device (eg. an iPhone, Apple TV or Mac) you'll find these work together beautifully. For example, you can create a reminder on your iPad and it appears on your iPhone. Equally, photos taken on your iPhone appear on your iPad, and you can stream music or videos from iPad, iPhone or Mac to an Apple TV.Some people think this \"locks you in\" - but it's your choice.What's great about the Air?-----------------------------------* Lighter (30%) and thinner than the previous version (469g from 650g)* Even faster A7 chip. Blazingly fast!* Improved sound (compared to the iPad 4)* Software including+ iMovie - edit and publish home made movies+ Numbers - Fully functional Excel for the iPad+ Pages - Word processor+ GarageBand - Play a piano or a drum kit+ iPhoto - Edit and organise your photosWhat's not so great?--------------------------* The change in physical size means you'll need a new keyboard or replacement cover if you're upgrading* Pity Apple didn't include the \"touch ID\" to secure your passwordsOverall Opinion---------------------It's hard to believe the iPad version 1 was released just four years ago, and there's a huge raft of \"me too\" tablet computers to choose from, but the Apple iPad Air is still the one to beat. As \"Which?\" magazine (in the UK) put it - \"...the best tablet we've ever tested. Apple packs a beautiful screen and lightning fast processor into a slimmer-than-ever shell, and battery life is very impressive\".Yes, there are cheaper Android based alternatives, but the quality, design and beauty of this tablet just sets it apart.

In comparison to an Android device it is far less customizable. You don't get to install different keyboards, or load widgets onto 8 different home screens, or install a completely different launcher all together, but this doesn't mean it's all bad. The user interface is very simplistic, but that actually works fairly well on a screen this size. The only thing that really sucks about it is that you can't hide the infrequently used apps quietly off to the side in the app screen like you can with Android. You are staring at all the apps at once from the home screen mo matter what. Even all neatly organized in folders it can still be a little hard to find what you are looking for. This coupled with the lack of information on the home screen(such as you get from a widget) would make me really dislike this on a small phone screen. It does work fairly well with the 10\" screen though, and the multi touch gestures make switching between apps and multi tasking a breeze.  This thing is extremely fast as well, you really can't slow it down. 10 browser tabs open, streaming music, playing a game, and checking your email, all while jumping back and forth between them is completely seamless. It literally feels like you can't feed it input fast enough to make it even stumble a little.  The battery life is also excellent. You will be hard pressed to kill it in a day. You would have to be gaming on it for hours to accomplish a dead battery I would think. I think the battery life is the perfect balance, to increase it any would in my opinion probably mean a sacrifice to either performance or weight and size. I typically get about 2 days of moderate use out of it.  For those of you on the edge between this and an Android device(or the constantly improving world of Windows mobile), the App Store selection is about the same. For the types of apps I use there seems to be very little difference, the are both excellent for social media, media consumption, email, and browsing the web. I do somewhat prefer the BaconReader reddit client app for android over what I have found here, but that is a very minor complaint. There are a few apps that are paid on iOS that you can get for free on Android, but at the same time there are more tablet specific apps on iOS, so I think it's a fair trade off.As far as day to day use goes it has been impeccable and I would recommend it to anyone. It has been reliable, fast, and had great battery life, any complaints are minor and subjective. In case Amazon rolls my review in with all the iPad Air models, which they probably will, I have the 32GB white version. I would also recommend avoiding the 16GB, after everything is all updated and the included free apps installed, you will only have a couple GB left for apps and media.", "Date": "March 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best tablet for normal people.", "Author": "T.

One of the first things that jumps out about this device, beyond the gorgeous display and excellent speed, is the long lasting battery life.  I have owned this tablet since the day it came out, and I am still averaging about 10 hours of battery life on it.  That is a good thing, too, because if one gets this tablet, they will be using it a lot.  That is, by and large, due to the tremendous versatility that the iPad Air provides it users with.  I have effectively utilized this tablet at both work and in my graduate courses, and by my judgement, my performance has seen a boost by consequence of that.With that in mind, it must be acknowledged that the iPad Air, or more generally, apple products are more expensive.  Critics of the iPad often point to that very fact, but a \"premium\" price boost to a top of the line product is not unique to the iPad - the nicest things are also invariably the most expensive things.  Because this tablet is so well made, there will typically be very little to no frustration associated with it.  It gets the job done across the board, be it for personal or professional use.  It is for that reason that the iPad Air is worth the extra $100-300. As a graduate student, I cringed at my bank account after I purchased this, but at this point, I'm honestly relieved that I got the iPad.  $600 may seem like a lot at first, but by the time a month has gone by, and one realizes how much they actually use this thing, that $600 will start to seem like a small price to pay.

In my case, Verizon had to scan the IMEI of one of their own devices in order to activate one of their own SIMs to use in this Air so that it could be added to my existing account and used on their network.

My eye doctor told me if I didn't stop being ridiculous and using my itouch as an ereader (I know, I know but it was so portable!) I could kiss my 20-20 vision goodbye. Basically Apple can thank my optometrist. That being said this thing is gorgeous. It takes beautiful photos and video, the screen is crisp and clear. While I don't run around in public taking photos and video with it I'm happy it has the capability. It's great for watching movies on the go and I've been very happy with the battery life.So why should you buy this one? It's a reasonable size without sacrificing screen size or quality. I think the ipad mini is cute but I have friends who practically have smartphones with a screen that size. It wasn't worth the price for me. We have other ipad products in my family, I've never been motivated enough to go out and buy my own but this one is a good size. It fits in a normal size bag or purse and makes me feel like I'm carrying around a pad of paper rather than a small laptop.I've had several people ask me why I bought a ipad instead of a kindle fire or the like. As I said, we have a lot of iproducts at my house and I'm very happy with itunes. This way I can easily swap movies, tv shows, ebooks, various apps I need on a daily basis around and basically this has turned into a backup laptop for me.

Others about the brightness...indeed I do have it cranked all the way up but the brightness is nowhere as bright as what is found on the Samsung Note 10.1 2014 edition, nor the iPad4 and my most recent purchase the Samsung Note 8. All 3 when cranked all the way up are much brighter than the iPad Air.I will be buying the new Google nexus 7(even with all the GPS and multi-touch issues) for the upcoming holidays but even in the store, that too seems much brighter...I am very dismayed at this lack of brightness from the Air but it is still more than adequate for indoors. I have not tried it outdoors nor will I as this is not my \"outdoor\" tablet...lol.I like Apple and the tight integration of their apps and the reason many including myself continue to buy their products. I do feel the price for this latest iteration is them trying to make money at our expense. WHO HERE DOES NOT KNOW IN THEIR HEART THAT APPLE IS TRYING TO GET IN ON THE CHRISTMAS RUSH AND PUT THE AIR AND THE NEW MINI WITHOUT THE FINGERPRINT FEATURES FOUND ON THE NEW IPHONE...COME MARCH MAYBE APRIL, APPLE WILL UPDATE THE IPAD AIR TO INCLUDE THAT FEATURE.I will continue to buy Apple mostly because their store has apps that are better, with more choices and work extremely well with their devices. I think this product is a 3 1/2 Stars at best and mostly for the size and weight reduction that is very significant. I feel the \"glass\" is too thin but seems to be durable as I have really been typing a lot on it as well as playing several games that require a lot of tapping. I am very happy with the size reduction but feel the brightness is not up to par with other new tablets or the iPad4.Recently the Safari browser has been \"crashing\" a lot over the past week in that when you tap on a hyperlink, the browser will basically disappear off the screen. None of the tabs close but it just disappears and returns you to the home screens. I also am finding the browser will get stuck/freeze for several minutes before resuming. I have several calls in with apple support and they are looking into the issues.Other issues is the VIDEO app, if you play a video via streaming not downloading and leave it somewhere like the middle or so on, it actually reduces your available memory by the amount you have watched from what I can glean. IT IS LIKE DOWNLOADING THE MOVIE TO THE POINT YOU HAVE WATCHED IT TO EVEN THOUGH YOU SELECTED THE STREAMING LINK. If you do this with several movies, you can basically wipe out your free memory. I find it difficult to clear the buffer and have basically learned to tell the app not to display any movies then to display movies then play the movie but move the slider to the beginning and press stop playing then done. Of these many steps I eventually clear the buffer but I am not sure which of all these steps actually is what does it if any!Oh lastly, the WI-fi is fantastic.FINAL RATING IS 3 1/2 STARS...MAYBE 4 IF NOT FOR THE BRIGHTNESS ISSUE.First I own iPad 2 and 4 and Samsung Note 10.1 2014 edition.I like...not love...the new iPad Air as it is faster both in operating the software apps and graphic intensive apps. The apps continue to be fantastic for all the pads not just the Air.Apple did a great job on the weight but FEEL STRONGLY THAT THE NEW SCREEN IS NOT NEARLY AS BRIGHT AS MY iPad 4 NOR DOES IT EVEN FEEL LIKE GLASS.As I type this review on the Air, the \"cheap tapping\" feel of this glass leaves me wondering how durable this glass is. It feels thin and makes a tapping sound not found on the more solid glass on my other two iPads.Oh I am keeping the Air for the faster processors but feel Apple has put out a product whose screen will not be as durable as prior pads.I can see it flex when I push down on it with minimal effort and have some light distortion when I press down like old type LED TVS.Apple over prices their products because they can and really did so on this iteration of their iPad. In my estimation the glass feels like plastic and the brightness is much diminished when compared to my iPad 4 and so must have a higher profit margin with all these cost cutting that resulted in a new iPad that for all practically purposes is just faster but not as solidly built as prior pads.Time will tell on the screen and maybe this is the way all tablets are headed to achieve the weight reduction and thinness. I love the ability to hold the Air in one hand comfortably for much longer than any of my current tablets. I am OK to sacrifice the glass quality as long as the touch screen does not suffer or long term screen reliability.I wish Apple would splurge and include a 6 foot charging cord...OMG $600 for 32GB and the cord is so short still after all this time...lol.", "Date": "November 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very nice hardware for the price! Lightweight, a joy to use", "Author": "Gearhead Mania", "ReviewID": "R3K3EAML83WH3K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using Android products mainly, but I first delved into touch devices with the first generation iPod Touch so I am familiar with iOS to an extent. For the past few years I've used Android FroYo, Gingerbread, Ice Cream Sandwich, and now Jelly Bean. I also have a Kindle Fire HD. The iPad Air is my first iPad, and I chose to go with the iPad Air because it has a much higher resolution than the best Android Tablets, with a really slick dual-core CPU and quad-core GPU. The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 is a close second but is more expensive than the iPad Air which was on sale during a Black Thursday promotion. The Galaxy Tab 3 just doesn't even come close with the screen resolution.The iOS 7 interface is OK. I prefer Jelly Bean's interface. Although clean and simple, the iOS interface isn't intuitive. There are too many sub-menus interwoven in odd areas. To change language, I have to go into no less than 2 sub-menu layers. Siri is fine, but Google Now/Google Search was far more intelligent and effective. Siri's default US female voice is much more realistic and smoother, but Google Now's other voices along with IVONA rectify that situation fairly well.The battery life on the iPad Air is very good. After an hour or so, I'm still above 90%. The WiFi is fast, and the overall UI is smooth. The movie/graphics playback is super fast. I can watch Flash based movies/video within the Safari browser without any hiccups.Compared to my 7 inch Kindle Fire HD, I felt that the 9.7 inch (Air's display size) or 10 inch screen size is just right, but only because the iPad Air is extremely thin and lightweight. The 7 inch KFHD is large enough to be usable for reading magazines, but it is not a good use of space. I have to flick through 2 or 3 screens while the iPad Air will show the entire page (in a very legible font size) in one screen. The KFHD is also heavy, so hopefully the new KFHDX is thinner and lighter.I used to make fun of Apple for going with the Lightning connector, but after using it up close, I can understand why it is innovative. It is made out of a solid chunk of metal with contacts on both sides. There's no \"right\" way of plugging it in, unlike USB where I constantly flip it around trying to figure out which side is up. But I still feel micro-USB is the right way to go, due to its universal acceptance with devices. The included 12W power adapter can actually charge the iPad Air at up to 14W of power based on what I saw with my Kill-A-Watt.With respect to the hardware and design, the iPad Air is outstanding at this price point. Aside from the hardware, the bulk of the iPad Air and Apple experience centers around iTunes, iCloud, and other Apple software. This is an area where I feel Google far surpasses Apple. The Apple ID system is cumbersome and annoying to use. I had to login probably a dozen times during the registration process, and buying/installing free apps required me to enter my password each time. It didn't seem like all of Apple's programs were tightly integrated because I had to use my Apple ID each time I fired up the apps for the first time. Once everything was setup and installed, it seemed fine. That said, installing and running Google's apps on the iPad was significantly less painful. The first time I used my Google account for an app (I believe it was YouTube), all of the other Google Apps recognized me and started syncing. Google Now/Google Search also puts Siri to shame, albeit Siri seems more \"human\" with basic functions. For instance, asking about the weather, Siri actually told me (In Chinese and English) that the weather wasn't very good at 27F. Doing basic searches, Siri and Google Now are about equal, but Google Now seems more intelligent with some of the intermediate activities like unit conversions or advanced searches.I never liked iTunes in the past, and my opinion has not changed with ITunes 11. It is overly complex to use. With Google/Android, I can access Play with a browser and have new apps sent to my devices with the greatest of ease. Syncing calendar events, email, contacts, etc... is also far easier with just using a browser versus the iTunes program on my PC. The good news is that iTunes isn't too bad to use on the iPad. Running Zinio, Conde Naste magazine apps, and other apps was smooth and problem-free.For those that like to use their tablet for browsing or reading magazines, or watching videos, I'd highly recommend a 10 inch display (the Air is 9.7\" but falls in the range). My 7 inch Kindle Fire is fine to use, but it is frustrating to use for magazines due to the amount of panning that is needed. After using the iPad Air, my Samsung Galaxy S3 feels claustrophobic with its 4.9\" display.Overall: 5/5 stars, the iPad Air is a well-designed device with great hardware especially with the Black Thursday/Friday promotions. However, Apple has a lot of catching up to do with respect to its software designs. I very much prefer Google's ecosystem as it is more \"cloud-based\" than what Apple is trying to do.

The female plug in the air was not quite the right size. I couldn't get a snug fit, also tried with the ear buds and another speaker. And as I fidgeted with the plugs to get a secure connection to receive a signal, the song would stop playing and the volume on the screen kept going up and down. Is this supposed to happen???? As for the sound, I wasn't expecting much from such a thin tablet. The speakers were on the back side but I'm not sure if speakers could be placed in the front.

Amazing product.  I have an ipad 4 and this in my house now.  The size and weight of this is terrific, though the comments about the brightness being less and the screen feeling a little cheaper rang true to me as well.I am also having the memory loss issue on the ipad air some have mentioned.  First, there is an ipad 4 in my household and it is also 16gb and, having passed it down to a family member, was very happy with it.  That said, the 16gb Ipad 4 has about 13.5 gb of usable space prior to loading anything, while the air somehow has 12.8.  Not really a big deal.  However, I have noticed my usable memory dropping dramatically (500 mb) on the air when doing streaming or using facetime.  I don't recall that happening on the ipad 4.  The memory does not recover afterwards, even after days and seems to continue to drop 100mb every other day even when I'm not using it.  It is not the apps or newspapers loading, as I pulled a lot of stuff off to check it.  I'm a light user of apps and don't store content, so 16gb was enough in my prior ipads, but on this one I'm getting worried. I was able to free the memory back up, but only after doing a full restore of the ipad as new and letting my cloud stuff stream back.  I really don't want to have to do full restores every few months.  For those interested, when connecting to itunes, it is the \"other\" category of memory that keeps expanding.  Tried calling Apple several times, but all they could offer was to do the restore.", "Date": "November 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Why did I wait so long", "Author": "RUSH46", "ReviewID": "R3TO3MYT3N3189", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this specifically to download and use some speech therapy applications for my wife who had a stroke.

But not without some downfalls due to recent changes.", "Author": "Sean Cushman", "ReviewID": "RNGUUYGUJBQ80", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Alright so I know if you are reading this then you already have your mind set on a new iPad and hey you know what? That's great. I'm a dual user. I love my PC products and Android and I love my mobile Apple products as well. I don't take sides or at least only when it concerns the best bang for the money at least. I've been using iPad's since I bought my mother her first one at release (she is disabled and iPad's (or tablets in general) are wonderful tools for those less than capable of using a keyboard and mouse. I also fell in love with it , the design was just amazing , the feel was great and the capability was very impressive when you consider at that time tablet's were barely around at the consumer level. Seeing the look on her face made it worth every single penny. Prior to getting the iPad she suffered a horrible infection and was hospitalized for 4 months fighting it , nearly losing her life in the process. She lost the capability to stand and only has use of her left hand now (with about 80 percent capability) and couple that with MS and you get someone who can't really use a mouse and keyboard setup easily.I wanted to state that before what I'm sure I will be accused of being a critical troll about the latest iPad version compared to a recent Android tablet I bought.Now onto the experience thus far with this new iPad , here is a list of what I like :1. LIGHT. Seriously , incredibly light. I can hold it in one hand very comfortably and its not meant to be held in such a way for the regular Joe ( I got big hamhocks for hands). I love it when technology trims up as it shows that its forward march is continuing without pause.2. FAST. Even over the iPad 4th generation this lean machine is even faster at multitasking which is good because it will help versus the recent Android tablet I bought which is a multitasking god.3. THIN BEZEL. If there is one complaint I have for the consumer electronics of the world in general its that we haven't done enough to remove overly large bezels from products. I hate them. I find they are a waste of real estate but I also realize that this is part of the technical limitation and the need for space for various reasons (board hardware , batteries and so on). The iPad Air's bezel is at least half of all previous iPad's. Very much appreciated Apple.Those are the biggest reasons to buy an iPad Air and they are really good ones in my mind. If you already own an iPad 4th gen though I don't think they are enough to justify the upgrade unless you really want the reduced weight (the iPad 4th gen is a pound and half while the iPad Air is only a pound flat).Now to the cons. And there are some that are very concerning and especially so if you tend to treat your products poorly (many people do..) :1. THIN PIECE OF GLASS. So while I realize that Gorilla Glass 3 is very impressive and amazing tough for its extremely thin profile .. I also feel its wildly out of place with a product like the iPad. People who buy iPad's and especially families tend to treat them pretty rough. I've seen children as young as 4 drop a 3rd gen iPad like a brick onto hardwood and it remained intact without a mark to bare. This new iPad Air has a very thin piece of GG3 that helps reduce the weight (and I would imagine the cost of manufacturing for Apple) but its recently been shown in several Youtube videos that when it comes to endurance its actually pretty fragile. Its very easy to crack it and especially so if it lands on its side. So while all the previous generation iPad's had a nice thick piece of glass to help protect the product this new one .. does not. It also sounds hollow when you tap it. And for some that drives them crazy. I don't mind this as I know its glass and not plastic like some \"claim\".2.COST. Since Apple did so much to slim down the cost of this new iPad and they used the EXACT same guts as the iPhone 5 (with a different layout and power profile) and yet they also trimmed down the battery size then how come this isn't any cheaper? The iPad mini is supposedly Apple's response to critics about the fact that its always the same price in each iteration. Apple , Android has fantastic alternatives now and the Google Play marketplace is becoming quite a fleshed out competitor , its time to start taking Android more seriously as a competitor and stop living inside your own eco bubble.3.SUB PAR HARDWARE VERSUS PRICE. Even with a new 64-bit chip (which isn't supported very well but that will change) the iPad is quite a puny product in terms of hardware specs. NOW BEFORE YOU FREAK OUT.. I know that Apple has optimized it heavily and that living in a very closed ecosystem (versus Android) gives it this advantage HOWEVER.. for what you are paying for you should be getting more. 1GB of RAM for instance? That's what I expect in a mid to low end smartphone these days. I can imagine those who complain (and have for a while now) about the random crashes because of running of memory would really love an extra 1GB of RAM for the iPad. I would also imagine it would do wonders for those who love to open programs by the truckload and not have to worry about random crashing errors due to running out of memory.Could you imagine a quad core A7 chip with 2 GB's of RAM? That beast would sing and you could do even more with an iPad that powerful. I would bet that when Apple moves towards 4k resolution that we will be getting those exact specs to run at that monster resolution but still I would have loved that right now.So my remarks about a recent Android tablet purchase.. I bought a Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 and I just have to say its a real beast and outshines Apple's best in many ways. The resolution is higher (2500x1600) and it comes with the S-Pen and S-Pen software plus an office suite of apps. Now the Note Pro 12.2 is made for business applications the price of it versus 64GB iPad is about a hundred more. But for that hundred more you get massive hardware support , with an OTG USB cable you can connect external hard drives to it , you can also add memory through SDXC cards (up to 128GB's) and Samsung's Touch Wiz is getting quite mature and really offers a very set of apps. Not to mention the screen size of 12.2 inches versus 9.7. However the iPad beats it in terms of weight , the Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 has a massive battery (but it lasts about 11 hours with heavy use) and the weight puts it into a class that speaks more towards laptop replacement that competitor to the iPad. However you can buy the non-pro versus for $100 less (you won't get the S-Pen) and still a get a monster solution.Android's tablet app market is getting better and better each week and there are plenty of apps that support landscape mode without issue. One thing I always thought Android did better was application scaling , something Apple could learn from frankly. The Galaxy Note 3 Pro in my mind is a Android finally getting its ducks in a row and Apple is going to have pick the pace to keep with Android's MASSIVE market share which is over double what Apple's is now.THAT BEING SAID.. I'm keeping the iPad Air. I love the Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 and its just a great tablet but I don't really have need of its business level features. But if I were going to recommend a tablet for a business minded individual I would recommend they go for it because it blows the iPad away for business use. The free office app it comes with is more fleshed out than MS Office for the iPad and the extra screen real estate is a big bonus for anyone attempting real work on it. But for a guy like me the iPad has an easier to consume profile and that's what I really love about it.If you intend to buy this product however (the iPad Air) I HIGHLY recommend you buy the Apple care warranty. You will be extremely glad you did with this powerful but more fragile new version of the iPad.", "Date": "April 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "As a Laptop Replacement, No Real Downsides So Far", "Author": "Marc Kennedy", "ReviewID": "R135BX9BW5FCYG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a grad student and when my laptop went on the fritz, this was my replacement.Pros - The Apple App Store is easier to navigate and more trustworthy in my opinion than the Android app store.- like my iPhone, the interface is clean and much less cluttered than my Samsung tablet- the onscreen keyboard is very useable- there are a lot of available accessories, as should be expected- this seemed like less of a toy to me than a Kindle Fire- free iWork apps- so lightweight- great battery life- the screen is beautiful- I can download all my docs from DropboxCons- the external button to put it to sleep is small- it may just be the screen protector I purchased (Tech Armor clear), but the distance between the home button and the edge of the bezel is small and the screen protector will not seal there- no fingerprint scanner like the iPhone 5s- there is currently not a flawless PDF app for iPad, so using Adobe reader on my laptop was a better experience", "Date": "March 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Ipad Air", "Author": "Sallyann Wagoner", "ReviewID": "R2QCORPE8PPSFZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I absolutely love this!!

I got it the day it came out in stores. It starts with the ultra-sharp exterior. If you loved last year's iPad Mini, you'll feel right at home with the Air. Apple essentially built a larger version of the Mini with the Air, by slimming the beveling of previous iPads to achieve a sleeker framework.The lack of heft makes the Air just a little more comfortable: An LTE-equipped Air weighs all of 1.05 pounds. Wrapped in a comfy and protective Apple Smart Case, the Air weighs 1.368 pounds, still lighter than a third-generation iPad by itself. Despite the lack of size, the Air is no less tough. It's sturdy and not at all easy to bend.The Air feels that much more like an electronic magazine. The Retina display, once the standard for all screens but also facing more competition this year, helps that; reading text and viewing web pages on that crystal-clear, pixel-dense screen is the same joy it was when Apple first built Retina screens into its tablets early last year.If this is all Apple did, it would likely still be enough to keep it on top. But the iPad Air does far more, starting with the new processor powering the entire experience, the A7. The same dual-core, 64-bit A7 chip that debuted in the iPhone 5S is in the iPad Air; and initially, this seems like a disappointment. In theory, you expect something more in Apple's flagship tablet, something a bit more powerful, with perhaps more graphical horsepower.In practice, you won't notice a thing. Web browsing and apps still handle as snappily as ever, even if you have a gaggle of things running in the background. Top-tier games such as Infinity Blade 3 continue to deliver. A pleasant surprise is also how quickly some of the beefier games, such as Anomaly 2, loaded, compared to previous iPads. You'll move into and out of levels just a little bit more swiftly, and that helps make the entire gaming experience more friendly and natural. It's hard to know what this really means for Apple gaming, but don't rule out the possibility of more console titles being ported to the iPad.Apple realizes the limitations of the 64 GB storage too, offering a new 128-gig model. You'll pay a more-than-average-laptop premium here ($799 for the WiFi-only model and $929 for an LTE version), but the improved storage is intriguing, especially for those planning for a game-heavy future. I can now easily and comfortably load all the music and movies onto the iPad Air that I want and still have plenty of room left over for games such as XCOM: Enemy Unknown and Civilization: Revolutions.Battery life is steady, even if it's not mind-blowing. Apple claims the iPad Air can get you 10 hours on a charge, and that's definitely true. Even when using Apple's navigation for a long trip to Washington, I easily got through a day without needing to charge; and more casual usage, such as Web browsing and email checks, is no problem.The Air's lone shortcoming is that it lacks the fingerprint identification technology that debuted on the iPhone 5S. But I'd be hard-pressed to claim that this was some glaring omission; every other tablet you're going to use this year lacks such tech, and I've never seen that tech as an absolute must-have.The resulting tablet is as pleasant to use as they come, and it's backed by some consistently solid software. Android has made a tremendous run over the past few years, and a plethora of both Android and Windows Mobile devices are truly intriguing this holiday season. But if there's one consistent shortcoming on those devices, it's the up-and-down support of operating systems.It's hard to know whether this Android tab or that will support Google's latest OS, but that's almost never a problem with iPads. iOS releases are generally consistent and stable, the lone knock on Apple being its lack of Android-like customization.And while the Apps Store and iTunes are also battling competition from Microsoft's stores and Google's Marketplace, Apple's setup continues to set the bar, managing to be intuitive and easy to use and enjoying more and more high-profile digital releases.", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love It!", "Author": "Amy Leftis", "ReviewID": "R9JQAS7K7K0PK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Much faster than the original ipad.

Recently I saved up enough money (about $800 total when you add in insurance) to purchase the latest iPad which I am reviewing now. I still always buy the 64GB version because I always need more space.What I like most about the the new iPad is that it is much faster and a lot lighter.

Even though it didn't have a front or back camera. I didn't mind.It's pretty heavy so, i just layed it down on a tablemost of the time. It was all fun and games, until the ios7 update came out a few months ago. After the new update,I could barely do anything on it. All of my favorite apps were no longer useable and, I had to delete them all because theyrequired the new update. After ios7, the first gen ipad suddenly became useless and, I felt cheated out on the amount ofmoney that was spent on that ipad. I'm very surprised that the ipad 1 only costs 200 hundred dollars less than the new one.Even though generation one is a discontinued model. In my opinion, it should be off the market completely. Why bothergetting this outdated device, when you can buy the newest one for $200 more? The ipad air has a completely different feel to it. It's a hundred times lighter.The iPad air has so much new things like Siri. Some people may think asking a electronic device to do something for you might be a bit lazy but, you can make a reminder within 5 seconds without leaving your current app. Siri has better results when searching for something specific. It's also helpful if you're slow at texting or, if your hands are full. Browsing the web is a lot faster but, downloading an app may take a while depending on your Internet connection.

After a few days of using the iPad Air and iPad 3 I can tell that an upgrade would not be worth the hassle of putting my older iPad on ebay and making up the difference which would be around $300 I guess (I have the 16 GB version) . Actually, a lot of professional reviewers online recommend exactly this: don't upgrade if you already have either an iPad 3 or iPad 4.The difference in size and weight is (slightly) noticeable when you are picking the device or holding it in your hands. The thing is that I never just hold my iPad in my hands when using it (and I do use it a lot!). Most of its weight goes either to the desk when I am at my desk, or to my lap if I am in my chair, or to my chest if I am on my couch. Which means I am basically using my hand(s) to balance the iPad not to support it. In such situations extra 7 ounces is not a big deal at all.If you are using your iPad differently (for example, playing games a lot) then you might appreciate the iPad Air better. Also, if you just want to have the latest and the coolest iPad then of course that would be worth it too :)Seems like Apple is following the same pattern with both the iPad 2 and the iPad Air, mostly squeezing the same device in a smaller package. This is not good enough for me. I waited until the iPad 3 came out to upgrade my iPad 1 (yes, Retina display was totally worth it!) and I hope that the iPad 6 will be worth an upgrade. But I am not getting into the hassle of replacing my iPad just to get a little bit thinner/narrower and lighter.Making the decision to return the iPad Air got even easier when I realized that its screen has a noticeable yellow tint which makes my iPad 3 look a bit bluish which I like better.Good bye, iPad Air, and lets hope that Apple will be able to impress even the most conservative of us with the iPad 6 in October 2014!

Many apps are optimized with animation and are even better on a larger screen, but....This device is not worth $500, its not worth $400, it probably should retail between $300 and 350, and here's why:*Locked in system. You have very little customization options. Yes, you can change wallpaper and move icons around the homescreen, but that's about it. No making the device an extension of your personality like Android.*Speakers. For being the most popular gadget on earth, why are there not stereo speakers on this device (one on each end of the tablet)? This is a serious design flaw that makes watching videos a huge drag because sound is muffled especially if the device is leaning on your lap.*Multitasking is a joke. These devices can only perform one task at a time. Apples competitors such as Samsung and Microsoft have already addressed this in their tablets, why hasn't Apple?*Screen Casting. This is not equipped with Miracast or have an HDMI out port. This means if you want to show your devices screen on a TV, you can't without buying a bunch of overpriced adaptors and cords.*Maps.

Up until then, I had never owned an Apple product. I have always had Windows pc\u2019s and I have an Android phone (Galaxy S4).I read that people just love the iPad\u2019s and thought it would be time to try out an Apple product. I bought it from T-Mobile to get their free data promotion. Now that I\u2019ve had one for about 3 months my overall opinion is \u201cmeh\u201d. It\u2019s ok.I don\u2019t hate it. It\u2019s light & portable. It\u2019s great for watching movies and listening to music. However, there are limitations that make me wonder why the devices are so popular. For example, Swype doesn\u2019t work on iPad\u2019s and if you\u2019ve ever used Swype on an Android device you know it\u2019s a great feature but one I consider very basic. True multi-tasking doesn\u2019t exist and you just don\u2019t realize how much you\u2019ll miss it until you don\u2019t have it. You can\u2019t print, for example, pages 1,3,&10 of a pdf. Instead, you can only choose a range, such as 1 thru 3. I still remember one of my first calls to Applecare+, where some young woman explained to me that you can\u2019t do a search in a pdf. She actually suggested that I add hundreds of doctors that were in the pdf to my contact list so that I could then find individual doctors. I quickly ended that call. The Apple browser, Safari, is slow. Chrome, on the other hand, is fast. These are only small examples but in general, the iPad seems to be much less flexible than my Window\u2019s computers or Android phone.As an aside, the support on Applecare+ varies widely. I have been connected to people that seem knowledgeable but have also had plenty of people that knew less about the iPad then I did, even after only 1 months use. Many of the young women referred to my iPad as an IPhone and didn\u2019t have a clue how to help me.They are also expensive. I bought the 32GB version and thought it was a rip off to pay $100 for the extra 16GB.Now, my iPad Air is 3 months old and needs to be exchanged under warranty. After 10 minutes of use it can\u2019t access the web anymore. Regardless of whether you use a browser or an app. They had me reset it back to the factory default but it didn\u2019t fix the problem. It's stayed in a case and never left the house. It's been babied. I\u2019ve never had any device fail after only 3 months use.I really wanted to love this device and thought I would based on other people\u2019s feedback. It just hasn\u2019t worked out for me though.

I was a previous Iphone user that moved on to Android because I didnt like the size of the 5.  I have two kids so consumer level usability is high on my list especially with a son that has autism.My choice came down to a samsung or the ipad since the nexus 10 2 is still MIA. :)  The samsung had several things going for it.  MicroSD, customization and control, mutliple user profiles but to be honest their overlay is a huge turn off and the plether backing with fake stitching just looks horrid.  I would say that the plastics are fine but why bother with fake stitching? I spent time in a B&M; and the feel was good, but visually as a whole it felt less...high end even with the price being in the same range as the IPad.  With several cloud storage options and knowing that I would be using it for light work related items and sharing it with my kids to some extent the MicroSD while nice was not compelling.  I do wish apple would realize that multiple user accounts would be helpful because that is one of the things that almost moved me to the samsung.  Both screens of course are amazing and I have to give it to the samsung on using a better aspect ratio for media, but the samsung felt klugy when trying to use it in portrait.  So with all this being debated in my head for a few weeks back and forth I decided on the IPad.  As an aside, I love the build quality and would have seriously considers a Kindle Fire HDX but the lack of the google play store put it out of contention.  It is one thing to have a walled garden like apple where just about any app you can think of is available, but it is quite another to have a walled garden like Amazon where you either have to root or sideload to simply get some basic useful apps.  If the Kindle Fire HDX had google play store, this might have been an entirely different review. :)Two things have stood out as I have delved back into the walled garden that is Apple...One, It may be a walled garden, but it is a gorgeous garden.  The app quality and availability is outstanding. If they allowed Google Play Music I would not have any issues at all with the app store.  I think that the tighter development control that apple institutes on its apps is a double edged sword in some respects but I have not had anywhere near the amount of bugs that I find in the android store apps so in that respect I appreciate that 98.7% of the time when I download an app it just works.  I use it with several google services including chromecast and have been very happy with the results. On a side note, the hardware and build quality is meticulous and the IPad itself is even more impressive after prolonged use, but that has been discussed and beaten like the proverbial dead horse.Two, battery life.  Apple seems to know how to eek out the battery life with more finesse than some competitors.Overall I like the IPad Air much more than I thought I would.  I bought it knowing from a techie nerd stand point what I was giving up with the ecosystem and I have had no regrets at this point.  I can use it for work emails and presentations and come home to play netflix or games with the kids.

The total length of the lightning cable is approximately 3.25 feet. Being used to longer cables, I've accidentally yanked this thing a few times but that hasn't done anything to my iPad Air... yet. However, you can probably purchase a longer lightning cable online.Also, I found the rate that the iPad downloads apps is about 5x slower than even an iPhone 4. Apple support told me this is usually because newer devices have a lot more to do like connecting to iCloud for the first time, etc, but I don't buy it. I think it's just because iPad apps are a lot larger than iPhone so I don't expect this to change, but I'll update if it gets any faster. UPDATE: Yes, my iPad does download at fast speeds now after one day, so don't worry if you encounter the same issue at first!While these two points are on the negative side, keep in mind that my overall experience is easily still 5 stars.

Even now, I get annoyed at some Apple-isms, the way Apple does some things, and try to stay away from it for the most part.  But I do believe it's typically more stable than it's technological counterparts, and easier to use for newbies.  Which is why we bought an IPAD 2 for our 8 yr old a couple years ago.  He took to it right away, it's intuitive enough.  There have been some slight issues, but it's still going strong.  Now 10, we just bought him this IPAD AIR... his 2 yr old brother gets the \"old\" IPAD 2.  And yes, the IPAD is intuitive enough for even a 2 yr old!  The screen on the AIR is so much better, clearer, sharper, and not just because it's \"new\".  Its resolution is just that much better.  Bought a cheap full body case until I could find a better one... trying to decide between the Otterbox (love the protection, not so much the hard cover design and that it doubles as a stand)... the Griffin Survivor (flimsy stand, landscape mode only)... or the Pelican Vault (no integrated screen protector, but I can put a protector on, and it is rated against water splash)... Lifeproof too expensive for what it offers... The 16G in the IPAD 2 was ultimately not enough after a year or so of use... Even with no \"movies\" or \"music\", games are much larger now, a few big games, and there is little left in a 16G device.  Without removing games, we didn't have enough memory left to upgrade the OS... so we opted for 64G this time... Though not an Apple fan, my 2 sons love them, I seldom have to \"fix\" anything with them, and so I rate it 5-stars!", "Date": "May 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "very happy", "Author": "charles a. winthrop", "ReviewID": "R20V3OWBNO61S9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "my wife loves it she likes it more than her ipad one.

First off, Safari crashes ALL THE TIME. I've only had one or two crashes on my old iPad so this took some getting used to. Secondly, there is the \"white screen of death\" where the iPad will just reboot itself for no apparent reason. Again, Apple products just don't behave this way so this was a huge disappointment. Finally, it is long past time that iOS add a real file system for saving files and sharing them between apps.

It's incredibly light and has a lot of useful apps for school (which is why I wanted a tablet). It beats dragging a heavy computer around campus, that's for sure! The sound quality of the speakers are really nice and the screen's resolution makes pictures beautiful.I only just received the product so the battery is quite new, but it has a very long life; even when you're constantly using wi-fi or bluetooth it will last you all day.If you're looking for a tablet, you should go with whatever makes you comfortable and consider what you want to use the tablet for.

Performance wise I do a lot of multi tasking and it doesn't even break a sweat. The picture is brilliant very clear and crisp. The size and structure are amazing light and beautiful very sharp. It fits in your hands like a glove. It has a great camera for a tablet you wouldn't believe the pictures I have taken with this thing I get a lot if compliments all the time. As for its competitors the samsung note 10.1 2014 edition, the structure of this ipad blows it away. Know Samsung has its own perks that Apple doesn't offer but I would still say its a fair superior product then the note. That being said I do own a galaxy s4 smart phone and I absolutely love it I just prefer my phone to have a bigger screen,and it has it's other perks as well. mainly the galaxy gear watch sealed the deal for me.

I had cracked my screen and it seemed as if it was slowing down over time, probably due to the updated operating systems putting more stress on the aging processor and memory.So, I saw a good deal on a used model appear on Amazon, and decided to go for it. For little over $500, after I traded in my older model, I had a brand-new, or close to it, iPad Air. The first thing you'll notice is the weight. It is at least half that of the previous models. The bezel thinner on the sides and the new thunderbolt port on the bottom. I also love the addition of stereo speakers, as I own one of the biggest recording studios on the East Coast and love to try out the music I produce on a multitude of sound systems. This allows me to hear what I've done in stereo, on a lower common denominator, so as to know what my music sounds like coming from the speakers of a system millions of people own.The next thing I noticed, is the screen seemed quite a bit brighter then my iPad 3. This could just be because of the aging screen tech under the glass, or some other factor. But it definitely helps for reading, even at half power, in darker and lighter situations that I have no control over. Next up, the speed at which everything operates. Not only loading software and apps, but in switching apps and multitasking. There is just a zip to everything now.The biggest thing I noticed, the Internet is 10 times as fast as it was in my prior model. I'm going to guess the MIMO has something to do with that, along with the two antennas. Giving a stronger signal, which in turn allows for the fastest Internet possible. I have 50 Mb Internet, and I now feel like I'm using every bit of it in doing something as simple as loading webpages or downloading videos, games and music. When I load a webpage, everything appears instantly, no more loading in of different aspects of that page, everything is just there. I think it is the first time, and Ive owned  hundreds of computers over the years, that I've noticed any webpage load so instantly.Games look every bit as good as they can, due to the increased processing power of the CPU and GPU. If Apple would only make a proprietary gamepad for the iPad, they would have a true contender for a great video game system on the market. Some of the games, especially those from Gameloft and EA, have every bit the quality that you see from any game on modern systems, bar a few effects here and there.Even music production can be done at high-quality, for the home or studio producer, with decent results. I've heard some songs recorded completely via the iPad, that you would've sworn were done in multi-million-dollar studios. They are that good. Which goes to show, great music is made by a great producer and not the equipment behind him.So, to sum things up:Positives:Great, bright, high resolution screenSmaller and lighterIncredible portable powerGreatly improved internet speedStereo speakers built inAwesome games and production softwareCheap accessories from third party vendorsNegative:Price, though I imagine we would sacrifice some quality at a lower price pointOverall, you will not find a better portable computer for the price. Anything Windows is going to have issues. Whether that be with drivers, malware, viruses or some or the other issue that goes along with owning a Windows machine. Sure, they are more powerful and will allow you a greater depth of software, but you make trade-offs with that power in size, weight and ease-of-use. So, if you have the means, definitely get the iPad Air. The upgrades are truly worth the extra cost over previous models. It's like having a super computer under your fingertips everywhere you go.", "Date": "February 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Converted Fangirl", "Author": "HardatTwerk", "ReviewID": "R1C5M2NPBI3XR9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So..for a long time..I hated apple.

The big thing is I've always liked the iPad as a concept but I've never fully fallen in love. I bought an original iPad, 2, and 3 but ended up selling them not long after because of a couple reasons. Mainly they just felt a bit like a luxury item I didn't have much use for and they weighed just enough to be uncomfortable to hold for a long period.The weight is now a complete non-issue. I fall back in love with it every time I pick it up because it just feels so perfectly designed for being held and interacted with. It also feels like much more than a luxury because of how much usability it now has. There are so dang many things I can do on my iPad, things I used to need my pc to complete. This is partly because of improvements by Apple but its also the simple benefit of web and app developers designing their services with mobile in mind.I can only imagine this comes off as a completely biased review but know I didn't get this device expecting to be so happy with it.

Young", "ReviewID": "R11CXF8RPTZQJW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased the IPAD air last week. When I tried to activate my accounts it would not allow it because apparently since I changed carriers I could not use my old Apple ID because it is tied to the old carrier. I can't establish a new Apple ID because I have an old one and if they delete the old one I lose all the apps I've paid for. I contacted Apple Technical where I was required to purchase tech support before they would do anything.  After doing this I went through multiple calls with multiple levels of support over three days so far with more to come. Seems that if the tech makes a mistake it stops the process and you have to wait 24 hours for them to be able to continue. They promise to call back and so far they have not so I called them to start the frustrating cycle all over again. I can't get the apps I want until this if fixed. I also can't connect to Facebook. For a machine this expensive plus having to pay for tech support for something that is Apple's fault I now believe Apple products aren't worth the gas to go buy one. I've been using Apples since the Apple Plus and I feel abused as a customer for the IPAD AIR. On top of all this they just had the gall to send me an email thanking me for contacting Apple Support. They have charged me for something a user should be able to do online with a new machine that is supposed to be the latest and greatest and it is just a paper weight right now. Can't return it because there is nothing wrong with it. Seems to me Apple is unethical and does not care about customers after a purchase.

If you have doubts shoot me a comment, I can help!Having used several tablets, I like the hardware weight and screen resolution of iPAD Air. It takes 3-4 years for a tablet maker to reach an acceptable level. All previous full size iPADs were heavy for me. I won't go into details of iOS7 itself. I am also disappointed Apple has GPS only on 4G models. The apps and security of iOS platform is generally good. What I don't like is the iTunes way of syncing up. Not a USB drap and drop. This is the primary reason for me giving a 4 stars. Android trumps in this regard.Overall being a geek, I like all makers. I don't bias and want Apple to succeed. Success of Apple will propel Google and other makers of tablets. My wishlist is to try a a Windows tablet once they get through a iteration cycle in late 2014.Overall iPAD is a delightful tablet as long as you accept its limitations.

The hardest choice.", "Author": "Mumbly Joe \"MumblyJoe\"", "ReviewID": "R1EP8MRB01CCTV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A lot of people have already talked about the merits of this device and the pros and cons. For me the decision wasn't so much which to buy but rather which one I wanted. Originally I got the mini to replace my kindle touch because of the price and the pocketable size. Ultimately I ended up with the air. Here's why:Grip: despite the very comfortable dimensions for 1 handed holding of the mini the extra thin bezel proved problematic. The palm rejection tech is supposed to be quite good but I found it unreliable and for those times I wanted to gets.  Eventually I always wanted to get a hold of it with  the bezel between my thumb and forefinger but either ended up with a thumb right in the middle of whatever I was watching or a hand cramp.Real estate: getting smaller means text is smaller especially on we pages In portrait mode. You can set the text size up for dynamic type but it doesn't work everywhere and when if does work and you change to landscape, then the text is far too big for the screen. Furthermore, in games where part of the screen is used for the controls I ended up wishing for a larger screen.Keyboard: the keyboard ended up being the main reason I went for the Air. While it is surprisingly good on the mini (really it blew me away how good the keyboard was in the mini) typing at that size for any extended period is taxing and it just can't compete with the Air if you plan on writing any amount. Furthermore, using the GarageBand keyboards are fairly awkward on the smaller screen. Unlike the accessory keyboards for the full size iPads, I found the external keyboards for the mini were actually much much worse than the onscreen keyboard.Pocketability: the mini fit quite nicely into a jacket pocket, in the climate where I live jackets are only really feasible about 3 or 4 months out of the year. Other than that it needs bag of some sort, which is really the same situation I'd be in with an Air.Weight: this made the choice the hardest. Holding the iPad mini feels like hardly anything at all. The iPad air feels considerably heavier. That affects everything you do with the tablet and the entire interaction with it. Fortunately it's mostly a matter of perspective. Put down the mini for a day and all of a sudden the air seems  quite light.For me the decision was made for the larger version but what about options?Cellular of no cellular? The free 3G on my kindle touch has gotten me out of a scrape more than once and having access to a no-strings-attached internet connection is guaranteed to come in handy at least once during the lifetime of your tablet. $130 is a lot to spend though, especially if you have a smart phone and free tethering on your plan. Originally I went for the wifi version for precisely this reason. However, the ability to tether is dependent on the carrier you happen to be using. Should you switch phones, carriers or plans or simply lose the phone while traveling tethering May no longer be a option and it's never going to be as convenient as simply opening the settings on your iPad and activating a plan. In addition you also gain the ability to use gps with a cellular modem and gain the benefits of enhanced find my iPhone accuracy in the event that it's stolen and the thieves know enough to keep it off wifi. Finally though, the possibility of a free 200 mb per month with t-mobile and the ability to switch carriers at will ended up pushing me to get the cellular version.So, after having initially been interested by the mini, a lot  of research, even more indecision and having bought, lived with and sold multiple versions of this thing I can safely say that the iPad Air with cellular is the  version I'd pick. If you don't plan on typing a lot with it though or watching movies, go for the mini.", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "First Ever Apple Product - First Ever iPad - LOVE IT", "Author": "JoHarley", "ReviewID": "R1X2GEOQACNWD2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The has become a great tool for my photography needs.

You will more than likely receive an ipad air with scratches, dings, or smudges on the screen or on the back. Right out of the box my ipad had a scratch right above the volume rockers.

First, try to buy the product through Amazon.  If you get lucky you will avoid 38+ dollars in taxes.  In my state I get charged that anyway.  I bought mine a few weeks ago and I now regret my decision.The ipad Air, full size not the mini, is expensive for what you get.  The much talked about retina display really isn\u2019t much better than Apple\u2019s or Samsung\u2019s normal display.  I take a lot of photos and even at full zoom I can\u2019t make out much difference.  The Apple ipad Air does NOT come with an SD card slot, and if you want to upgrade from 16gb to 32gb you will be looking at over $100 additional dollars.  Many of Apple\u2019s competitors have the SD slot and cost less.Apple sells an SD card \u201creader.\u201d  You can download from the card to the ipad but NOT the other way.  And the ipad SD card reader will run you $30 plus dollars.  You must buy other $30+ dollar accessories if you want to use a USB memory stick for example.  I purchased a non- Apple SD card triple reader (USB and SD for example) for about $9 dollars.  The machine complains at me but it still works (but, once again, it only loads to the machine not from the ipad as a normal SD slot does).An SD card reader would have been easy to install as part of the iPad, and this gives their competitors an edge, especially when one is taking photographs and trying to download them immediately to examine on something other than a 2 inch screen.  As I shoot RAW (large files) photos with my Canon this inability to use an SD card is a real pain.Downloading music from Amazon to iTunes isn\u2019t any picnic either.  My wife has an android device from Dell running Jellybean and she downloads everything with zero problems.  Plus, she has an SD card slot which really helps.  Her screen is as sharp as mine.Finally, the OS systems.  Jellybean has about a million apps written for it while I have about 200 - or that is how it seems to me.  Her system is faster than mine AND her system is intuitive and mine is not.  I\u2019ve had to read over the Apple manual for ipad three times trying to get things done.  Maybe my largest gripe is I bought the Apple thinking several Apple machines could sync up and trade information easily including photographs and music and documents.  Wrong.  I\u2019ve tried numerous syncing ideas and none of them work.  I started using Pages (an Apple word processing program) instead to Word to get it to transfer.  Finally, I saved it to the cloud and managed to get the document to the other machine.  Photographs that are in the photo stream do transfer; however, getting the photograph into the stream when it was not automatically placed there by the ipad doesn\u2019t work.  And finding photos to look at in the ipad, when the ipad did not take the photo and the photo is on another machine (with the photo stream on and home sharing on) the photo still does not come up.  Very frustrating.After using the ipad and watching and using Jellybean and Android in action I think the Android devices are a much better deal.  Get one with an SD card slot.  I am certain Apple has designed their machine so the user cannot get extra storage on the machine (as an SD slot would allow) and must buy a more expensive machine if they handle large files.  If you like buying music at Amazon good luck getting it to iTunes onto your machine if it is an Apple (Yes, I have Amazon cloud player).  My wife got her music downloaded in about a minute.  It took me an hour to get one of Mozart\u2019s songs I had purchased downloaded to my computer.In retrospect, since the programs do NOT sync up as advertised, the machine has little storage unless you pay an enormous additional price, the retina display is not revolutionary, and the number of programs are minimal compared to Android I wish I had purchased an Android.  Samsung seems to be on the cutting edge there, although my wife\u2019s Dell is performing just fine.", "Date": "February 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Apple iPad Air", "Author": "Oscar Crumby", "ReviewID": "R1LFVGKI48DRB6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I would recommend this product to anyone that is looking for a tablet.

Nobody seemed to know what was going on or how to help me.This is really annoying. I'm a professional software engineer and have a lot of experience with mobile devices, and have never had to deal with this kind of runaround before.Add to that the fact that Safari crashes about once per hour, and I have to say this device is a big, expensive dud.

It's tv quality display unlike the laptop or regular computer screen that is not visible if you are standing off to the side or too far away.I still hate touch screen tablets preferring the keyboard control of laptops but I have no regrets about this family purchase.  It does load internet pages faster and it does have the best display I have ever seen (but we are not a high tech wares household).  You can see the images from different angles from distances unlike how you need to position yourself to view a laptop screen.  So basically the high price can be somewhat justified in that for the price of a really good laptop - you can get a tv quality screen.  If the iphone had come out with a bigger screen like the Samsung Galaxy Note 3, I wouldn't have supported the purchase of this device and I would have been wrong about that but my brother has been sick and this makes him happy every day when he holds it - he smiles to himself.  After a few weeks of holding it carefully in a plastic bag!, we finally got the nearest perfect case for it: the i-Blason Apple iPad Air / iPad 5 ArmorBox Kido Series Light Weight Super Protection Convertable Stand Cover Case (Black).  I wanted the Speck handyshell of the Tylt stand but I as wrong.  The iblason folds under making it sturdier and better especially on a bed.We have screen protectors on front and back because this looks like the iphone 5s in that it is prone to scratches.We went with 64 gb after deciding on the 32 gb because nevermind Apple's profit margins, it was worth a hundred dollars more to prolong the life of this device.  Hopefully, this will be the only ipad we ever own.  We know people who still have their one and only ipad 2.This is another nonremovable battery so don't overcharge it.  You need to break out the included adapter because it's designed to be powerful enough to charge this ipad.  Iphone adapters will probably give you the message that the device is \"not charging\" after lighting up for a few seconds with the charging symbol when you first plug it in.It is thin but it is like a hard wafer - so it still FEELS thick in some ways - but it turns out one pound FEELS heavy to us so we didn't mind putting a fat case on it and ruin the thinness of it.  For the first few weeks without a cover, it didn't feel like that comfortable in the hand but then neither did the iphone 5s without a case.Holding something thin like the Air or the 5S does not make the device feel grounded but I definitely do not prefer the ungrabbability of the laptop - it is always a chore to haul a laptop.I don't doubt after living with the Air that Apple will be putting out much bigger Ipads in the future - it's the grab and go quality that is the selling point and we need bigger screens - this will then cut into Roku's competitiveness because Apple WILL put out an Ipad that is just large enough to make owning a tv set nonessential - it just needs to be bigger enough to be a few feet from the eyes.  Apple TV has real competition in the Roku but a bigger Ipad would not only be a laptop killer but it could make flat screen tvs less important.***********you can stop reading if you just need to decide if this is a good device - it is.  It also happens to be exponentially more expensive than Android and Windows tablets.The Apple walled garden feels BIG - it doesn't feel like the Android one which makes you feel like you went the a la carte route - you got a removable battery and removable memory with your device and you're feeling clever about saving money but the trade off is that you always have to scramble and you are NEVER SURE that you got everything covered (think of Apple as frustrating and expensive American citizenship as opposed to being a citizen of the European Union - Apple SUX!)  Android is missing apps and you notice when shopping at apps that it doesn't feel like the Apple App Store on the device - it doesn't feel like you have almost internet-size reach within the Apple universe.  It doesn't give you the feeling that you are receiving the goods first.  Android updates can be wonky and there is no accountability there - Samsung just apologizes if bad code screws up their phones that you now own and those updates with the unappetizing names that only sound good in theory but are all frankly, DREADFUL foods are never guaranteed for your particular device.  It feels like there is no recourse, no genius bar, nothing if there is malware or some other software problem.I'm not happy at all with Apple because of the nonremovable battery and the tough luck attitude if you plunk down way too much money BUT I can't trust the Android products at all BY THEIR VERY NATURE.  Google themselves won't refund their own branded devices after 14 days.  Am I supposed to head out to their California headquarters and beg for some customer service?  It doesn't matter if Apple stores don't make the majority of the sales  - they indicate a commitment to the customer.I'm always afraid Samsung is going to fold when it is no longer profitable for them - chaebols do do that.  I honestly don't think Google and Motorola are seriously interested in taking away from the Appleverse.  The Appleverse is the alternative, the break time from working on Microsoft computers.I would think the Android devices after they stopped getting updates would be as useful as the gameboy or nintendo ds toys in the back of the drawer somewhere.I'm not an Apple fan but I don't think Android has a shot despite offering removable batteries and memory sometimes which are extremely important especially for work-related data.*****************************The Apple Store lets you buy gift cards or coinstar receipts to pay.  Sony wants your credit card information even after they \"got\" hacked and released all the credit card information of its accounts.  Microsoft is only slightly better.  It's arrogant to force us to lose our financial privacy and security to access a device that we paid for.****************Who do you want to have access to too much of your personal information?I don't want ANY Of my stuff on ANY cloud especially if it is work related.  The internet-enabled devices are getting way more myserious, inaccessible and way slicker in the way they are not providing a description of what they do, how they do it, what is entailed, etc.  It's all ... hazy like a CLOUD.The internet access and the access of the apps to the owner's information makes me very uncomfortable which is why I see this as an entertainment device and not a work one  - it is impossible to look under the hood and control this thing - it takes the user for the ride - we are NOT in the driver's seat with these devices but that is also another reason to go American (that means Windows, Android Motorola/Google or Apple) and Apple and Windows are the ones with more closed systems but they're not perfectly secure.I think Siri indicates that not only are they recording our voices but they digitized them and broke down our voices into code not for recognizing our COMMANDS - but that means Siri could probably say something you never uttered in your voice.  The touchscreen could have been a fingerprint collector all along and the camera - well, I'm sure it is always on.**************Apple's litigation against Samsung is big news this week and if Samsung has been allowed to make money (it may be the only competitor who has something to show for its efforts) then it may have been in on it which means it can shut off the lights on their android devices and just sell big appliances because Apple's legal wins have huge implications.  It let competitors (usually foreign) copy (mostly for android - the name \"android\" doesn't really invite confidence thanks to Blade Runner and I, Robot) and if Apple is now suing Samsung successfully for copying - that means Apple didn't strike until there was something they could get back financially and it also means that Apple can damage you enough so that all your years of efforts will be for naught.  Those sunk costs - that's the poison.So I wonder - what if Apple sues in the home countries - the ban is for Samsung sold in the US.  What would Korean courts do about a lawsuit by Apple in Korea?  Does that make Sony Experias vulnerable in Japan?  What about Nokia now owned by Microsoft in Finland and in Italy one of Nokia's strongest markets?  What about the touchpad controller on the Playstation 4?Three days from the anniversary of the Pearl Harbor Attack, Comedy Central is reairing South Park episodes on 12/4/13 in this order:HumancentiPad - not only about the actual war crimes committed upon civilians and POWs by Mengele and Unit 731 but also about Apple's originality AND their dominant attitude towards their rightsfollowed byA Song of Ass and Fire which reiterates the claim made in Black Friday that the selling point of the Playstation 4 is the touchpad interface.Apple can pull the litigation trigger at ANY TIME and because they already won with Samsung, Sony's attorneys are not going to be able to drag out much of the issues of the lawsuit so that the Playstation 4 can sell for as many years as its predecessors.Holy Moses.", "Date": "November 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Expensive but built cheap.", "Author": "Timothy M.
