It has the 4KPlayer app which allows for all formats to be played on the tablet. That particular video player supports hardware acceleration and plays all the formats (including 720 and 1080) flawlessly.It can handle several applications at the same time. I'm impressed, and this is a great buy. 5/5.", "Date": "October 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "HD Tablet: High Performance, Low Price", "Author": "Mary L.

For under $300 and far less than the price of the newest iPad model, you get a crystal clear, 10-inch HD display, customizable Android OS, and a super-smooth quad core processor all packed in a light, compact tablet PC.The first thing I noticed was the simplicity of the package contents and packaging design.  With what came in the box, it was super easy to break out and get going right away.  Also you get a wall charger as well as a micro USB cable which makes powering this thing really convenient.  With the exception of the primary charging input and headphone output, all ports on the tablet are located in one area and are protected with a very handy dust shield, which looks pretty sturdy compared to other designs I've seen.  It also comes with a neat micro-SD slot, which is handy for data transfer up to 32 GB at a time.  The external speaker is also a great feature for showing video clips and video chat.The feature most worth mentioning is the awesome HD display, since I work in marketing and was looking for a way to give one-on-one, quality presentations on the fly.  I downloaded a very useful office suite app and can not only view presentations, but also spreadsheets and documents as well.All in all I'd say you're getting a great deal given the price point combined with the quality HD display and it's uses.  I'm definitely happy with it!", "Date": "October 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "A very good value; a very good android tablet.", "Author": "JMat", "ReviewID": "R3NBAAZ7QU7537", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a very good general android tablet and I give it 4 stars mostly because of its exceptional value,although, its technical offerings, with a few exceptions, are very good. It is a beautiful white tablet with a very small bezel edge. It is listed as a 10.1 in. screen sized tablet but that only refers to the diagonal measurement of the screen. Its actual size from edge to edge is 7\"x10\" so be careful when you buy a case for it.The G-Tab allows you to carry out the same functions as many other much more expensive tablets do with the same kind of ease. The graphics are very clear and fairly sharp thanks to its Mali400 High Performance 3D Gaming GPU . It is fast and most importantly it is very stable. The A31s Allwinner  Quad Core CPU  really does this tablet justice. Except for the camera (which seems to have been made not for picture taking but for webcam use and perhaps document imaging) and the minor ports location design quibbles, I found that all its listed functions do perform well. I mean who uses a tablet's camera to take pictures. The tablet is also `rooted' which means that you will be able to install apps that only work with a rooted android device. That would be,for example, apps such as the firewalls in Avast and Comodo's security software. Firewalls only truly work with rooted devices. I bought one tablet as a gift for my nephew and while setting it up for him, I put it through the wringer testing all its capabilities and it held up through all my abuse beautifully. I was so impressed by the value and function provided by a tablet at this price range that I ordered me a second one. Of course, I am referring to the $197 price range that I bought it for. I ordered my second one on January 3, 2014 for $197.Now, my friend that is good value. Right now,right after I made this last purchase, the price went up and Matricom is selling it at the $299 Plus 10.77 shipping price at amazon.com. I guess that the good reviews have gone to Matricom's head. At that price, you might as well start considering other more stable tablet options from Samsung, google, et al. And by stable, I mean tablets that have the possibility of future support for updates of the operating system. If you go to their supplier <quantum supplier> you will see no sign of future support for this tablet but then you have to balance that out by the one year defective hardware warranty that they promise.Now, it is not a perfect tablet but it is very good where it counts. Where this tablet will fall short for some people-I mean some people- is in its flash storage capacity. Eight gigs of storage with three for system resources and  for storing applications from google's play store and 5gigs for your photos, music, vids, etc. is not enough storage for people that install a lot of apps, especially games. When you download apps from the play store they are automatically installed into the three gigs system partition and considering that this tablet does not make it easy for you to move them to the second partition of the internal flash memory you will need to do something to avoid insufficient storage problems. Don't forget that if you just buy an external microSD flash card and just pop it into the unit that the only thing that you will be able to use it for is to store your music, videos, and documents but not to install your apps. For most people, that will not be a problem.So, here is a solution for those of you who will be bothered when your tablet tells you that it cannot install an app because of insufficient storage:1. Buy a flash card (30gigs, class 10 would be good) from amazon.com and use it to store your music, pics, vids, etc.2.  Go to the google play store and download the free utitily \"move Apps (Apps 2 SD)\" and move all the movable apps to SD partition of the tablet. That would be the 5gigs second internal partition.3.Don't use the tablet without buying the microSD card suggested above or you might run into the \"out of storage\" problem as you start to install more apps from the play store.", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "definetly worth the money!", "Author": "casey", "ReviewID": "R141YSH86T9KO0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "<!--\n\nfunction

I was originally going to get an ipad but I found this on amazon for 249.99 so I purchased it so save some money. I was very surprised that when I got the product at how easily it is to use.  The display is a 10-inch hd and is crystal clear and is very light tablet. It is very customizable to the things that you need. Its design seems to be very durable as well and has a great battery life.  The reason I chose to purchase a tablet is for school, net surfing, Netflix watching, and composing short documents for work. Within the first twenty four hours I found myself completely addicted to this tablet and wondering how I'd ever managed life without it. The graphics and sound quality are excellent for the price and it is extremely easy to set up and use. I enjoyed being able to listen to music while at work and school, getting instant email and Facebook updates. I've played around on friends' Ipads before and personally find this  much easier to use the keyboard is easier to type on and I find it easier to scroll while browsing the internet.  I also like that it had the dual cameras which makes skyping and  taking pictures even easier.Overall this is a great tablet and worth the money.", "Date": "October 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not bad.", "Author": "Undertone tire", "ReviewID": "R1QH1NTEDLGXA0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Coming from an Ipad (first Gen) i was expecting something similar, well, not built as well for sure. Now saying that, being more of an Android fan than IOS, i love the Jelly Bean. My phone is Ice Cream Sandwich, so there were some minor differences. The tablet is faster than the old Ipad, has more of a wide screen format, has 2 cameras, USB, HDMI, and the Micro SD slot. These continue to be my biggest complaint with Apple not providing these minor additions(other than the camera on newer models). I agree with others, the camera is marginal, the 720P video recording function is a little choppy. Works well enough for Skype etc. I was able to plug in a Micro USB charger, and it seems to be able to charge through that, time will tell. The standard charger is a pin type power connector, this one thing drops my overall score a bit. The back is aluminum, and the build quality is pretty good for a sub-$200 tablet. The display is pretty sharp, colors look ok. Not higher end tablet quality, but usable for sure. The touch is responsive, and pages scroll very well. Comes with flash installed, but needs a third party browser to enable it. I use dolphin or Firefox, both work well with the flash once you enable the plug in. For those that care, it WILL connect to the ELM327 Bluetooth and run Torque for OBD2 diagnostics. I would have given 4 1/2 stars if i could, but its not 5. I will update my review in a week or so if anything changes. Update: working well, however 2 issues.

I use this mostly for school, e-mail, surfing the net and watching You Tube videos and Movies. Ok, so straight out of the box the unit feels solid and well made. The buttons on the side are self explanatory so it was easy to see where to charge it, and to turn it on. While others have negatively commented on the door that hides the USB, micro USB, and memory card slot, I have no problems opening or closing it and it's as sturdy as any others that I have encountered on other electronics.When I hit the power button the G-tab powered on in seconds.It is fast and responsive to the touch, downloads everything I've needed quickly and with no issues, including proprietary school documents. Everything works the way it is supposed to, the battery usually lasts 6-9 hours depending on what I'm doing. The only issue's that I have experienced are that the camera's take grainy pictures, but I didn't get this tablet for the camera and the speakers could be louder, also not an issue for me because I normally use headphones.This is a great tablet and much cheaper than anything comparable. I ordered a keyboard case for my G-tab (also here on Amazon) and after a month of solid use I still love it. I hope this review helps others ;)  P.S.

(1280x800)resolution at a bargain price.  I personally spend so much time YouTubing for musical performances from Late Night television shows, streaming concerts from across the world and catching up on morning sports debates and ESPN highlights that I may not have time for in the early mornings or late nights.  Watching Netflix and Hulu Plus on this HD screen is a joy.  It is a excellent tool for social networking and it provides easy access to Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and video chatting with friends and family on Skype or any other application downloadable through the packaged Google Play Store. I particularly like the sound of the keypad as it clicks with a crisp feedback when you type on the keypad or click on an application.  The only discrepancy I have is that I wish the front face camera had a higher megapixel count but I have had no problems video chatting with anyone nor did they have trouble viewing my face. For the Gamers and online internet radio music streamers, this would make a fine investment for those that love listening to tunes through Pandora, Spotify, and playing Angry Birds. The sound is exquisite and the colors are quite vibrant as you can multitask applications to accommodate your busy day. Already 8GB standard memory but conveniently expandable up to 32 GB through a micro SD card expansion. I'm quite satisfied with this buy! 5 stars for the pricing.", "Date": "October 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good tablet but I question the production QC process", "Author": "Dale A.

Tablet 2 worked perfectly and to date I am very satisfied with its performance , battery life and overall experience. So I returned tablet 1 and purchased Tablet 3.Tablet 3 had a flawless screen  but its Wifi connection speed was considerably less than tablet 2 . with every test I did , OKLA speed test, YouTube downloads , movie downloads , switching positions of the tablet .. It made no difference tablet 2 always demonstrated a faster download speed. I have checked all the settings and both tablets have the exact same android version , firmware version , kernel version and Build number. Given that this tablet will be used mainly for media viewing if I cannot figure why tablet 3 is so slow I will definitely be returning it. It seams like they may have at some point swapped out internals . So to sum it up , this is a great tablet if you get one that was built properly and has its WiFi internals are configured correctly . if I figure out how to improve the download WiFi  speed I'll update this post.To date I have reset and reflashed my matricom tablet and the download speeds on tablet 3 is still about half of that on tablet 2 . It looks to me that someone in the finance department decided to go with a cheaper part to save a few pennies and messed up a perfectly great product. I think I will be returning tablet 3 and ordering another one hoping that I get one from the good production run.http://youtu.be/aOdy4bEc9AY", "Date": "February 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great value", "Author": "Sandy Rodriguez", "ReviewID": "R3OTII99VZULF4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So far the G-Tab has been everything I could want: fast, responsive and easy to use.

I assumed that this was simply one of the many clones built in China or somewhere else in the Far East by a small manufacturer. Perhaps so, but Quantum did quite a decent job. The IPS screen is reasonably responsive and while the 1280 by 800 resolution is not state of the art, it is good. While 8 gig of memory can be quite limiting, Android is very efficient and one can load a number of Android apps on the tablet. The tablet comes with Flash installed (for Android 4.2) and one can play flash videos (for example from the NBC web site) by activating the flash plugin in some browser such as Firefox. You can also add a microsd card and use the card to move apps from the tablet to the sd card. This helps the user overcome some of the limits of only 8 gigs of memory. The tablet appears to be fairly stock Android, and the user has full use of the Android Play store. The system does not recognize the proper amount of memory on the flash memory card, but I will keep filling it with apps and media until I get a \"full\" message. Audio is okay, screen refreshes are obviously not as fast as on the latest Samsung Note 10.1 or the iPad Air, but decent. The battery life appears to be good, but the charger is not microusb, so don't lose it. I have used the tablet for 4 days, and so far so good.

However, Amazon really screwed up on the description of this item. In the description it claims to take a mini USB port, which is NOT true. It takes a MICRO USB. Because of that, the two cases with built-in keyboards that I ordered for myself and my fianc\u00e9 will have to be returned, because it's painfully obvious that a mini USB plug will not fit into a micro USB port. My advice to any buyer is to wait until they get the item and then purchase a case or keyboard for this tablet. Don't take Amazon's word for the specs like I did. Wait until you've got the item in your hands and can see for yourself what accessories and plugs will fit.Back to the tablet though... this tablet is great. Moderate use of apps and emails and other online activity, I'm getting at least 12 hours right now from the battery. I received this two days ago, so it's been going through some testing.

She lugs around the laptop and was having trouble carrying it. Her computing needs could be covered by this tablet so I purchased it. For under two hundred dollars, the reviews looked favorable enough I decided on this relatively unknown brand. Her eyes aren't that good so I needed to get her the ten inch tablet versus a seven inch one. It's unfortunate because for that same money a good brand could have been procured in 7''.At first, I was pleased with myself. She loved it. The HD display is nice, the weight is on point and it did everything she needed it to do. The camera has a very low resolution and that was initially all I disliked about it. Now it is hardly February and she's having wireless issues. Mainly, the internet will work on one day and not on another. How is she supposed to cope with that? I've tried working it upstairs, and downstairs when it's within several feet of the router. This router can operate two laptops and a phone without problems. I tried using this tablet with ONLY the Matricom requesting internet. No dice. I just looked into my orders to return it thinking I'd try out another tablet to see if this was merely some hardware fault in her particular one. My window expired TWO days ago. I now plan on buying a more reliable brand like Asus or Samsung and I'll be the proud owner of this secondhand paperweight. Thanks, Matricom. I'll remember that I shouldn't roll the dice on electronics.My advice? Stick to a brand you've already tried and found to be true. The knock-offs can really burn you.

It's not HORRIBLE, but it's not great either.  This matters not at all to me since I use my iPhone, which has a flash, to take pictures with.  If it's important that you have an upscale camera feature - this unit might not be for you.Occasionally the touch screen doesn't respond the first time a selection is made. I found this on the far left of the screen usually.  I'm a patient person, so this really doesn't drive me crazy.  Especially since it happens only in very limited circumstances, and it's easy to work around it.  If you are a gamer it might matter to you.Overall - I'm pleased with this purchase, and I look forward to finding lots of ways to use my new tablet.", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wireless Issue!!", "Author": "yukon sunrise", "ReviewID": "R3NYXMH3IZ0QC5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "We received this item yesterday from a seller on ebay.  We really like it.  But there are serious issues with wireless connectivity.

But have no estimate on when or if this will happen. At 30 feet, line of sight, no metal obstructions, we get only 2 bars and the internet is extremely slow.  Anything under 4 bars doesn't seem to work well.  We also tried it on another router/different channel with the same results.

My G-Tab reports a total storage space of 4.24GB (not to be confused with \"available\" space) so perhaps I am misunderstanding something here. I realize Android needs about 1GB.It's a speedy device considering the specs. Battery life is quite nice too.The video quality is impressive (again, this is a $188 unit) and all in all I see this unit being great for air travel (movies, music, my pinball app) and downtime in airports.I tried to pair it via bluetooth with my Oontz Angle bluetooth speaker but it just wasn't finding it. I'm a little unclear with this issue... since the speaker and my Samsung Galaxy paired perfectly.I think you'll be pleased with this.

When I first received the tablet I noticed a black strip on the corner of the screen that was most likely an assembling error I ignored it because it was on a corner and not particularly noticeable. The first week I had the tablet it well after that I would occasionally get buggy or would take longer to load pages on e-book or comics.Finally I got too much inconsistent performance on wifi. I always receive a fairly strong signal with the tablet but I always get different readings for download/upload speeds. One time I'll be with in 10 feet of my router getting the correct bandwidth and 5 minutes later I won't even get close to 1mbps.I suspect that my problems with inconsistency in performance reflect an inconsistency with internal build quality, (the out side of the tablet is sturdy). It seems ordering this tablet is a bit of a gamble on getting one that performs vs getting one that has problems.

The Description is Not as What it Promises...", "Author": "Eric. B", "ReviewID": "R5XY060LABAMM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "At first I was thrilled to get this product as it arrived quickly but after I received it I felt very disappointed at the tablet in terms of what the description promised.My main gripe with this tablet is its not a true HD style screen comparing this to a tablet I recently bought as this tablet's replacement (Wal-mart's HiSense Sero 7 Pro). Its fuzzy, especially when swiping to move the screen to view something else and even when viewing black or dark backgrounds, pictures and videos, the screen flickers as you can see horizontal lines \"bounce and dance\" from top to bottom of the screen as if it had some issues, I found this annoying at night when view videos or pictures. I had factory reset this tablet about 5 times to see if it fixed the problem and I had no luck.Sometimes (especially for those who use Go Launcher EX) It lags quite a bit. Even when not using Go Launcher EX the touch input is slightly slow. I would say no more than about 1/4 of a second. Very critical when playing games or doing quick swipes.However the general overall speed and graphic capabilities of the tablet allowed me to play games such Sonic Dash and Emulators from NES to Sega Genesis with little to no issues other than the input lag on the touch screen. The wifi and bluetooth abilities are ok from wifi I'm about a good 15 feet away from the router going through a wall that's about 4 inches thick and had no slowdown when viewing Netflix and Youtube videos in HD (As HD can get on this screen in particular) and using a bluetooth gamepad worked fine as well.Overall I have to rank this a 3 out of 5.Cons:That this isn't a true HD screen. The screen is fuzzy and it flickers horizontal lines on dark and black pictures and backgrounds is very annoying at night.The Cameras are too flickery and images are too blurry to make out. I didn't use these to take video or use Skype with.The lag input may be ok for those who need a tablet just to use for daily and work tasks but if you want to play games be warned about the 1/4 of a second of input lag.It hangs up and freezes at time during some apps, I had to clear the ram and the cache a few times to clear that problem.This tablet can't charge through a USB port, it uses its own AC charge with a small circular port on the end that you may find on older cameras and this is annoying seeing that by standard that most devices can charge through a normal 2.0 USB port.Pros:The build is made of a dense metal casing and it feels very sturdy. However the side where all the connection ports are is a plastic however the ports are hidden in a clasp and the clasp is hard to open up as I feared to open it as I though it would break off so be careful of your finger nails when opening it.Wifi and Bluetooth works well within the particular range of a standard host device. I tested out the Play Store and downloaded apps with no problems, used Dolphin Browser with no problem and also used Skype for general instant messaging and there were no problems sending and receiving messages. I also used Netflix and Youtube with no lag or issues.Sound is ok considering the speaker is Mono, just watch nothing covers the speaker but the headphone jack works fine when listening to music and videos.I would only recommend this tablet for those who are starting out using tablets, who aren't out for a true HD screen, need this for daily internet usage, curtain work tasks or for children.

It would've been a good budget tablet at the price if it worked stably.  I didn't want to pay extra for a brand name tablet, and the specs of this tablet seemed good enough for my uses.Unfortunately, I must've gotten one of the bad ones - the screen had constant static color noises in the entire screen, and they were pretty noticeable against certain background colors (e.g., Skype's sky bluish color).  I could not read a pdf (one of the primary reasons for buying the tablet) because these color jitters were constantly moving in the background.  After a few hours of checking out the features, the tablet froze and I had to do a hard factory reset as a normal reset would not make it bootable again. The tablet started making a strange noise when booting up, like electric components starting.I really think this tablet could've been a good choice had it worked stably.  Unfortunately, the quality control on this tablet seems very bad.  I returned it the same day and ordered a somewhat more expensive ASUS tablet after looking at similar no-name brand tablets with good specs.  They all seemed to have quality control issues.

I use 3 laptop and a desk top PC but I want a 10 inches tablet just for go to the web.  I do the research and read the reviews, I choose this Matricom G Tab 10 Android, is a 10 inches tablet with OS 4.2.2.I open 4 windows when I am on the web and doing good, but open more than 5 windows is slow down but not auto close the browser, instead ask to wait or close the browser. WiFi, I setup downstairs and get good signal upstairs. I don't plan to play games with this tablet so I don't know how good or bad on the games or download a lot of Apps.  All the common use Apps are already installed, just turn it on and ready to go.  Battery, I total used about 6 hrs after full charge and still shows about 50% battery left. As all Androids tablet to turn on/off, there are two way. One is quick turn off (Sleep mode still use battery) and total turn off, (hold power for about 5 sec, not sleep mode). When is at total power off mode, to turn back on need to hold the power button 5 sec.  Put 32 Micro SD Card (TF Card) work.  USB (is a mini USB Not a Micro USB as its said) I try with a Mini USB OTG cable from my iRuLu work and see flash drive and Microsoft USB wireless mouse, but the 2 USB cables (Not know is regular mini USB or Mini OTG) come with the box is hard to put in, I don't put force to put it in that might damage the port.  Bluetooth, try with IPad Bluetooth wireless key board work.  Don't try with the HDMI cable yet.  The Cover for the USB, Micro SD, HDMI is hard to open, be careful might broke the cover plastic attachment, use finger nail to open.  So far I use it for about 3 week and don't know how long it will last.  One minor complain is the cord for the power supply is about 4 feet long need extension cord from the wall outlet.

Out of the box, it seemed to work quite well.  I was able to play several games and read my books without any issue.After a couple of weeks, it seemed to shutdown and I had to force it to reboot.  Not a big deal, but after a couple of more times of this it seems to be more of an issue if you press/hold on the device in a certain spot it just shuts down.  Still not horrible, but just a pain.Since I've installed quite a few apps and tweaks, I decided to reboot it to factory defaults.  Bad decision there.  Now I can't get the Amazon Free App of the Day application installed.  Amazon thinks it's running iOS.  Used an APK extractor to take it off from my Kindle and it installed just fine.  However, the app now stops responding.  I'm going to have to try and extract it off from my Android phone in hopes that maybe it is just a version issue, but for it to think I'm running iOS is ridiculous.The WiFi is definitely not its strong point.  Very weak and a lot of times I have to turn it off and back on in order for it to connect after powering the unit on.If you want something for taking pictures, this device is useless.  Quality is horrible, but the description of the device even points that out.Game play is decent and as I said, reading is nice too.  I like the bigger screen, bluetooth, HDMI output and USB connection.  Its also nice to be able to power it through the micro USB and an actual power cord.My next purchase will be the Aerb\u00ae Universal 9-10 Inch Tablet Portfolio Leather Case W Detachable Bluetooth Keyboard.  Since I'm going to use this for some work, I'd like to be able to have a nice case and keyboard for it.  Hopefully, that will help to make up for some of the downfalls.Overall, nice replacement if you want a bigger screen than the Kindle Fire for the price.

The shell isn't very sturdy and will probably break if dropped or impacted in any way.  I got a great keyboard case to keep it in and it seems to be alright now, but at first the case was so loose it made it hard to get the mini USB properly connected and the charger is very loose in the connection.

I rated this tablet 3 stars for a few reasons that i will go into later in my review. I want to say before i starte the review that i tried to give a fair and accurate description of the product with not hate in mind what so ever. Overall for $175.00 it wasn't a bad buy but not a great buy for \"me\" either an ill explain why.Cons:*What everyone complains about the most on the reviews for this tablet is the Wi-fi antenna which they are correct about. within 20 to 25 feet of a modem the connection is fine but drops off severely afterwards. My iphone off the same wi-fi works just fine any where in the house.*The sound quality from the speaker is not good. The single speaker is in the back of the tablet an its small and not loud at all. Watching youtube video's on full blast you literally need to turn off all other sounds in the house/room to barley hear the tablet. My iphone sound output in 3x louder then this tablet which is terrible in my opinion. (i had to buy a small mobile speaker)*Next is a quality control issue(personal) : When i took the tablet out of the box i immediately notice that it had looked like a piece of lint, or some small article underneath the glass of the touch screen in 2 areas. Not sure if its lint or a crack in the touch pad(not the top clear glass screen)? One area is not badly noticeable but the other i notice right off the back about a cm long! (maybe when they were laying the screen on, it was dusty that day or something??) i tried to call them about it, but i was on hold for over 10min so i hung up, will definitely call them back asap because there warranty is 30 days for them paying for the shiping on a bad product but afterwards, 1yr. but, you have to pay the shipping back and forth. Still its nice they have a 1yr warranty!The screen resolution: \"This is not really a con as much as it is a small nit pick because the screen resolution is still nice!\" The tablet is advertised at 1080px800 but i don't believe it is. I dont have anything to test that for a fact but i know what 1080p looks like an this tablet does not seem to have that type of clarity. The screen resolution is not bad at all it is very good and well lit (not dim or hard to read),so let me just say that first. But, that said, i don't believe its 1080p. unless theres a switch that you have to turn the 1080p resolution on, nothing that i viewed movie wise or just regular viewing was in 1080p, more like 1024x800p is what it seems like.Lastly, The camera: The camera is not good at all, which i expected that because the other reviews said the same thing. The clarity of the camera is old school, like the first camera lenses of the old smart phones. But, that said, they do serve there purpose of skyping or snapping a picture of mediocre quality and i'd rather have two cameras then not!Pro's:* Very good battery life and quick charge.* Very good not great screen resolution. (compared to a newer apple product.) but at this price its Very nice and not a disappointment at all trust. (i'm just nit picking).* Very quick speed through web pages and apps.* Came 100% charged.* Comes with Great features, apps and accessories.* Multi-tasking is a breeze with no lag.* A quality construction of product doesn't feel flimsy or cheap at all.* 1 year warranty on defects (very nice).* upgradeable memory up to 32gb.* 2 Camera's*Hopefully good customer service..lol but ill see about that when i come to them with my issues. Will update my review on seller and product after.Over all:I would buy this product for under $185. and feel like i got a good deal! I would have also rated it a 4 stars if i didn't have the personal issues with my tablet. This product would be a 5 star if they get a better speaker and Wifi antenna. Your going to sacrifice a few things the cheaper in price you go but for the money paid, its not a bad product, it's just restricted in certain ways.  If you can live with those issues stated above, i think this tablet is a good buy worth giving a try and you probably won't be disappointed.", "Date": "February 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Tablet!!!", "Author": "Marlene", "ReviewID": "R1QC4XMEB3RCP0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great Tablet!!!!!!
