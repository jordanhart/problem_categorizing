{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Beautifully built, incredibly fast, the best tablet computer ever!", "Author": "John Ryan", "ReviewID": "R3CXMI18TV70OE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The new iPad Air is Apple's latest, slimmest, lightest release of their hand-held computer.  Oddly enough, it's so beautifully easy to use (my one year old daughter loves playing with it), it's almost doesn't feel like a computer at all.A word of warning - this review is written for people who've never owned an iPad before - and are wondering what all the fuss is about.  If you're thinking of upgrading skip down to the \"What's great about the Air\" section below, or just buy it - it's amazing.Just what's all the fuss about?--------------------------------------I used to own a laptop for work, and (very occasionally), it'd sit on my lap on the sofa, and I'd use it for pleasure (eMail, watching films or playing the odd game).  Then I bought my first iPad, and the laptop became redundant, a boring \"work device\".  Hard to explain, but the fact the iPad is so small and light, and you navigate around with your finger by pointing and gently swiping the screen makes the whole experience a lot easier - a lot more fun.Even my most \"Luddite\" of friends have been won over.It's incredibly simple and easy to use (it only has one main button), and everyone from my one year old daughter to my 85 year old dad have taken to without problems.  It's size and shape also support using it like a book (literally to read a book or web page), but you can also watch TV and films.Personally I'm also paranoid about my password getting \"hacked\", and someone running up a huge Amazon bill or buying stuff with my credit card on eBay.  Well one of the benefits of the iPad (and iPhone) is it's \"almost impossible\" to get a virus - one of the most common ways to get hacked.  This doesn't mean you shouldn't use strong passwords, (both Sony and Adobe got hacked), but it's reassuring to leave the Windows world behind.Finally, I love the way these devices (iPad, iPhone, Apple TV, Apple Mac), increasingly work together.  The fact you can start a Pages document on your Mac and edit it on your iPad, or take photos on the iPhone, and in seconds see them on the iPad or Mac and display them on the Apple TV.The thing is, \"it just works\".What would you use if for?----------------------------------* Shopping online.  Obviously - you could be reading a review on Amazon about the iPad Air!* Reading News stories.  As you can hold it like a book it's great to read the news online (my wife loves the UK Daily Mail newspaper Online - personally I prefer a web digest from free app Zite).* Reading Books.  It's great for reading books from Amazon Kindle or Apple Books with the benefit of 1,000s of online book reviews* Navigating web pages.  Instead of clicking with a mouse, you gently swipe your fingers on screen to scroll around* Watching Films.  I use it to watch Netflix online videos (with an Apple TV you can send stuff to the telly)* Reading and replying to mail.  I use \"mailbox\" a great free app to read and reply to mails, but there's a free one included* Showing and organising photos.  Any photos on an iPhone are automatically available within minutes in \"the cloud\"* Playing games.  From fun puzzle games like \"Cut the Rope\" to fully fledged first person shooters.* Listening to the Radio.  With \"Tune in Radio\" you can listen to thousands of radio stations world-wide.  My personal favourite is London UK based XFM - alternative rock* Listening to music.  I stream mine to an Apple TV, but you can also buy portable speakers or just plug into the AUX socket* The list goes on and on.Which model should I buy?----------------------------------I can't comment about Android tablets (apart from the Google Nexus which is well regarded), but in terms of the Apple tablet line-up in order of cost:-1. Avoid the Apple iPad 2, it's a relatively old model, under-powered and with a lower resolution screen.  If you really want an Apple but don't want to spend the cash, buy a 16g WIFI 3rd or 4th generation iPad from eBay.  Avoid this one.2. iPad mini is a lovely tablet.  A 7.9 inch screen and astonishingly light and remarkably thin - it feels like a light-weight book.3. iPad mini with retina screen. Again 7.9 inch screen, but with the blazingly fast A7 chip and a \"retina\" (high definition) screen.  Worth the upgrade if you can afford it.4. iPad Air.  Much larger screen size (9.7 inches - doesn't sound much but it makes a huge difference).  Same fast (A7) chip as the Mini with Retina - the latest and fastest iPad available.Clearly (from my viewpoint) there's only really three options.  The iPad Mini, the Mini with retina screen and Air.What are the Optional add-ons?-----------------------------------------Well, assuming you've dropped by the Apple Store (which I would highly recommend - fantastic service), and handled the iPad Mini (with/without retina screen), and iPad Air then your options are around memory size and cellular option.Memory:  Once bought, you can't add memory (space for apps, films, books etc).  However, the basic price goes up a huge amount (+$100 for the 16g to 32g iPad Air).  But, having owned a 16g and then a 32g iPad - I can safely recommend the 16g unless you really want to store a huge amount of videos and downloads.  Only you can decide, and if you're lucky enough that money is no object then splash out.  Otherwise, 16g should be fine for most people.Celular:  Allows you to connect to the internet while you're out and about.  This will add an additional +$100 to the price and means you can slip in a mobile phone SIM card.  This means (for an additional $5-10 a month extra), you can access the internet on the move.  Alternatively, you can opt for the WIFI option, and use it at home or at at \"hot spot\" (eg. Starbucks, most rail stations and hotels etc).Personally I'd buy (and indeed did), the 16Gb iPad Air WIFI.Do I need anything else?-------------------------------Most people (me included) buy a cover.  Apple (and now several copy-cats) make a \"smart-cover\" which automatically shuts down the iPad when you close it, and switches it on when you open it.  There's versions which cover the back, or just the screen.  Apple charge from $35 to $65 for their (admittedly) high quality fabric or leather covers, but there's many available from $10.  Be aware, you do get what you pay for.Personally,I think it's a pity to cover the beautiful aluminium industrial design of the iPad with a cover - but if you've spent hundreds of pounds you'll want to protect it from scrapes and bangs.I also invested in a keyboard ($20-$70), as I tend to write a lot of mails and documents (remember it comes with a word processor).  I'd recommend the ogitech Ultra Thin iPad Air Case with Keyboard - Space Grey and the ZAGG Keys iPad Air Case Folio with Backlit Keyboard although these are strictly optional unless you want to use your iPad as a proper laptop.Finally, if you have another Apple device (eg. an iPhone, Apple TV or Mac) you'll find these work together beautifully.  For example, you can create a reminder on your iPad and it appears on your iPhone.  Equally, photos taken on your iPhone appear on your iPad, and you can stream music or videos from iPad, iPhone or Mac to an Apple TV.Some people think this \"locks you in\" - but it's your choice.How should I set it up?--------------------------Well, if you already own an iPad or iPhone it's incredibly easy.  Just log in with your existing iTunes and iCloud accounts, and select the option to either set this up as a new iPad or restore from backup.If you've never owned an iPad before - read on to hear about how to set up an iTunes and iCloud account - it certainly confused me the first time I used them.+ iTunes account - is how you buy your music, Apps or films from Apple.  You register your credit card with them, and protect the account with a secure password+ iCloud account - is used to identify you as an individual.  This gives you 5Gb of backup space (your iPad will be automatically backed up when you charge it), and also means your iPad will work together with your iPhone.How to set them  up:1) Create a SINGLE iTunes account for your immediate family and children.  Then when you buy an App, it's immediately available (for free) to all the family members.  Maybe once the children reach 15-16 they'll want their own account (as otherwise they'll end up spending your hard earned cash on your credit card to buy music you don't want).  Until then - it's a great way to share the Apps.2)  Create YOUR OWN INDIVIDUAL iCloud account for person.  That means if you buy an iPhone you can share data (eg. reminders, notes or calendar events) across both devices.  If you're partner (and maybe even children) have their own iCloud account they also have 5Gb of space, and can keep their own notes and documents private.Easy when you know how.What's great about the Air?-----------------------------------* Lighter (30%) and thinner than the previous version (469g from 650g)* Even faster A7 chip.  Blazingly fast!* Improved sound (compared to the iPad 4)* Software including  + iMovie - edit and publish home made movies  + Numbers - Fully functional Excel for the iPad  + Pages - Word processor  + GarageBand - Play a piano or a drum kit  + iPhoto - Edit and organise your photosWhat's not so great?--------------------------* The change in physical size means you'll need a new keyboard or replacement cover if you're upgrading* Pity Apple didn't include the \"touch ID\" to secure your passwordsOverall Opinion---------------------It's hard to believe the iPad version 1 was released just four years ago, and there's a huge raft of \"me too\" tablet computers to choose from, but the Apple iPad Air is still the one to beat.As the UK based consumer magazine \"Which?\" magazine put it - \"...the best tablet we've ever tested.  Apple packs a beautiful screen and lightning fast processor into a slimmer-than-ever shell, and battery life is very impressive\".Yes, there are cheaper Android based alternatives, but the quality, design and beauty of this tablet just sets it apart.  If it were a car it'd be a top of the range Mercedes or a BMW.Highly Recommended.", "Date": "January 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Longer lasting power, faster, lighter, with free top quality apps to

I own an iPad 2 and 3 and now this new iPad Air version.  My main reasons for updating were that I literally fill up my 64 GIG iPad every day or two with videos and photos that I shoot.  Having this larger version at 128 GIG allows me to work longer and add more to my iPad.  In addition this new version is much lighter and easier to use all day long.  Even though the battery is smaller in capacity than my iPad 3 the battery life is longer and it is very noticeable. This is because the faster A7 CPU and the motion chip actually use less power.Please watch my video as I go into more details in it.I immediately noticed the increase in speed.  The unit connects to the WIFI faster, synchs with iTunes faster, downloads emails faster and speeds up your web browsing.  The differences are very noticeable and enjoyable as a user.  The dual speakers are a nice change but I also use a lot of Bluetooth speakers to enhance the sound of the iPad.In my video I do a size and weight comparison to an iPad 2, an iPad 3 and the iPad Air.  I also show how the basic set up takes place and for advanced users you can just speed through that portion of the video.  The iPad 2 weighs 1 pound 5 1/8 ounces, the iPad 3 weighs 1 pound 7 1/8 ounces, and the iPad Air weighs 1 pound and \u00bc ounce.  The iPad Air is narrower but has the same screen size.  The left and right edges of the iPad are thinner on the sides of the useable screen and you can see that in the video.Here are the key improvements for me:* Much lighter in weight* Thinner, smaller design with the same screen size* Much faster when synching with iTunes* Much faster when browsing the web* Much faster when downloading emails* Stronger WIFI connection and faster WIFI synching* A more powerful AC wall adapter with 5.2 VDC and an output of 2.4 Amps.  It charges at 12 watts of power. It operates at 100 to 240 VAC and 50/60 Hz and it is UL approved.  It features folding AC wall plugs for easy packing when traveling.* Lower CPU and motion chip power consumption that makes the smaller/lighter internal battery last longer!  This is very noticeable!* As usual a beautiful high resolution retina screen with 2048 by 1536 resolution at 264 pixels per inch.  You can see the difference in the photos, videos and reading quality of the screen.* Dual speakers in the bottom* Free high quality Apps* iPhoto* iMovie* GarageBand* Pages* Keynote* Remember to download these from Apple!Overall this is a superior product that really outperforms the older iPads that I have.  I was disappointed that the new iPad Air did not have the home button with the fingerprint sensor built in.  Since I have used it with my iPhone 5S I have really become attached to it and it just seems like a way to cheapen the unit and be more competitive instead of showing and using the enhanced technology.  I would have paid a little more for the iPad Air with that sensor.This is still a 5 star product and I recommend it as a very good tablet.", "Date": "November 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "Daniel G. Lebryk", "ReviewID": "R2RCYFJ9NNSROC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The iPad Air is everything I imagined it would be and a lot more. This latest generation iPad is so much lighter than previous versions; it is now approaching the weight of a Kindle - meaning it is easy to hold for a long time. The body is about two inches narrower, making it easier to hold. The retina display is so darn sharp and looks great.The iPad Air finally pushed me to upgrade my original, version 1 of the iPad. I bought that iPad on release day, seemingly millions of years ago. I loved that device, my one complaint was that the iPad was too heavy - everything else about it was great. Now that I've used the Air, I'll never go back. This was an upgrade well worth doing.November 2, 2013 Update: After using this for two days and thinking harder about the iPad, I figured you might want a few reasons why this might not be for you. Your iPad works just great and you don't do much more than read email, play angry birds, and look at websites all at home. In my case I went from a slow turtle first generation iPad to this lightning fast new version - I'm blown away. And if you have a latest previous version and get a great deal on recycling your current model (read at least $200) then it might make a lot of sense. This is an expensive device, and a MacBook Air is not all that far away from the iPad, after you add $60 for a case, $100 for two years of accidental breakage coverage, and maybe $60 for a keyboard. A MacBook Air at $1100 suddenly doesn't look all that expensive anymore, especially if you opt for the 128GB option of the iPad. Of course there is nothing like holding one of these new iPads and they are super sweet. If you are super logical and conservative, this is probably not the device for you.On the other hand, I decided to jump in both feet first.Setup was super fast and easy. There is a good step-by-step wizard to get the device running. Since I have an iCloud account, I was blown away with how fast this thing synced. That whole improved WiFi antenna is not hype - the device connected quickly with my network. Most devices take a while to connect to my network, this was painless and fast. Filling in the information for my mail account, it seemed like seconds and new email was downloaded - significantly faster than my other iPad.I had a choice during set up to restore from a backup or set up the unit as new. I chose new device, so none of my apps loaded right away. If I had chosen a backup, I could plug this into my computer and with iTunes could have grabbed my purchased apps. All incredibly seamless.Video is stunning. Amazon Prime Video took seconds to start (I've gotten used to 15-20 seconds). The video started in standard def, and within 15 seconds switched to high def. So much faster than happens even on my PS3. I have never seen buffering move this fast, scanning forward, there was a 5 second delay for buffering and the movie resumed. Sound is much better than the single speaker. It is still not great, just more passable. It is silly that they put two speakers on the bottom of the iPad. A speaker on top and bottom would give movies stereo. Music sounds better. Two speakers put out more sound, the stereo effect is minimal, the two speakers are one inch apart.This is an incredible display for films. The blacks are deep, rich, and have great tone range. Out of the box, this display looks fantastic.Everything moves so darn fast. Switching apps is a snap. New apps load with a blink of an eye.I'm glad I bought the full size iPad; Apple got this size and weight exactly right. I think this is well worth the extra $100 over the retina mini to be released the end of November. Apple has blurred the lines between these two devices. I guess they've done the same thing with iPods, so it makes sense they would do it with the iPad.If you've used iOS 7 on an iPhone, the iPad is essentially the same thing - you will feel right at home.", "Date": "November 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Beautiful product, non-premium hardware.", "Author": "Avenging Taco", "ReviewID": "R52KR35VM0NQ3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have owned several Apple products, and the iPad is the most distinguished among Apple's line up relative to its competition.  The most compelling aspects of this tablet are the beautiful design, and the 10 hour battery life.  These are the two features that made me decide to purchase another Apple product irrespective of their business practices which try to squeeze money out of their customers by not supporting devices properly after they are released.After having used this product for over a month now, I can say it is an improvement over my iPad 1.  The browser now crashes on the original to the point of making it worthless.  My original iPad had 256 MB of RAM which is not enough to load a lot of modern web pages without the browser crashing.  That is why I had hoped the 1 GB of RAM in the iPad Air would be sufficient, and it has improved, yet I still find that the browser crashes on occasion.  The scroll latency is very subtle, but noticeable to me.  It doesn't really impact my usage, but it could create problems for people who game on their iPads.  Putting in 2 GB of RAM (which is what I have in my Nexus 4) does not cost that much, and would improve the performance greatly.  For a premium product, I expect the best, and Apple has consistently under-delivered on processing hardware which created the same problems all the way back to the iPhone 1 I purchased on launch day.I take 1 star off for business practices which burn through your pocket, and the second star is removed for needless low-RAM browser crashes that are still a problem on the latest iteration (which is likely planned to force relegation of old devices and compel new sales.)  Still, I can say that this is the best 10 inch tablet available, and android has no viable alternative worth purchasing.  If you can overlook the two biggest strikes I have against Apple, you should consider no other 10 inch tablet at this time.UPDATE 1/17/14Today I called into Apple support because my browser is crashing frequently.  I am now experiencing 5 - 10 browser crashes a day when it was only 2 - 3 times a week when I first purchased it.  Speaking with the Apple support technician, he said that they have not received many complaints about this issue yet, so I may be experiencing a rare software or hardware problem.  I looked through my crash log (which had over 100 crash reports in it since Nov. 11th) and the vast majority of them were low memory crashes.  However, the tablet did not operate this way when I initially purchased it, and it began to increase in frequency about 2 weeks ago.  Therefore I suspect that there is a software conflict (I still have 4 GBs of free flash hard drive space, so I doubt it is a conflict with virtual memory, although a RAM hardware problem is possible).  I went through some basic procedures the technician recommended, and I was advised to do a system wipe if the problems should persist.  I will test the tablet for a few days before wiping everything and starting over. I'll update this review once I am confident of what the issue was.", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Apple still rules the tablet world.", "Author": "Makavelli02", "ReviewID": "R3AWGSO5C50M8A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of let me tell you I am not an apple fanboy. I own and support samsung products. I carry a galaxy note 2 with me every day and would not consider an iPhone until the make some huge changes to it. Last year I bought a nexus 7 and loved it. Now that it's specs are getting a little dated I had to look for an upgrade. The new nexus 7 didn't impress me with it's dated CPU. So I looked to the note 2014 and the iPad air. I used both side by side and researched every detail. I sell these things for a living. The note is very impressive but, for all it's stats and hardware features it still struggles with simple movements. You can point out is 3 gigs of ram and the very good snapdragon 800 quad core CPU. Then you have apples 1 gig of ram with the measly dual core a7 CPU. ????? Now for the real world facts and it pains me to say this because I love android, but the fact is the a7 in the iPad air with it's upgraded clock speed at 1.39 gigs has yet to be matched in any bench mark from another mobile processor including the quad core s 800 by snapdragon. And with the future in mind the 64 bit tech is hard to beat. Them to the 1 gig of ram vs the 3 gigs in the note. If you can't use all that horsepower why put it in there. The air is twice as snappy as the note with no lag what so every. The note on the other hand lags even on swiping through home screens. It all comes down to the operating system apple remains king. Android may be pretty and customizable but that all comes at a cost. That cost is performance. You can take a car with 500 horsepower and put it on a curvy bending road. All that horsepower doesn't mean a thing. The car with 200 horsepower will still win by going straight.So I bought the air and love it.

They all went back to the store after much disappointment & I would go back to reading on the Kindle App.The iPad Air has become my mini workstation, paired with an Apple wireless keyboard, my library, my entertainment zone where I watch movies, play games & listen to music. I can also shop, do research-the list is endless! The device is as light as air even with a leather cover. It stays cool-no overheating. It is fast & with 128g, there is room for what interests me.

I've had original iPad, iPad 3, and now the Air. Many people may say iPad is not worth the price for what it does, but in my case, it was worth every penny. I used iPad 3 and now the Air mostly for browsing the web, reading textbooks, and occasional gaming, and for these tasks iPad Air is perfect; not to mention, I've saved a couple of hundreds on textbooks already. Air is much lighter and faster than the other iPads I've had so far. Now, I can easily hold it longer while reading longer texts, and I can see the performance increase in web browsing and games.Mini vs. Air DilemmaI first got the new iPad Mini with Retina display, because the Apple sales person said it is identical to iPad Air in every aspect other than screen size. Of course it turned out to be wrong, since mini is a bit slower and has the display color accuracy issue. After a week, I went back and exchanged the mini for iPad Air. While mini is a wonderful tablet, I was keeping it much closer to my eyes that I liked to. Web browsing also suffered a lot on a smaller screen of the mini even with Retina. With iPad Air, everything is back to normal again, and I can browse the web more easily now.Wi-Fi vs. 4G CellularI have had the cellular version of iPad 3 and the original iPad. To be honest, I only enabled the service for a few months and disabled it afterwards. I find myself to be always near Wi-Fi networks, either at school or work, so I decided to get the Wi-Fi version this time. Another reason was that I can always turn on the Hot-Spot feature on my phone, and share the internet with iPad Air. Because of these points, it didn't make any sense to pay $130 more for the cellular version.Games and PerformanceI've tried a few games, including Dead Trigger 2, and the 3D performance is very good. The new A7 processor really shines here. I am sure new wave of 3D and 64-bits games will come to iPad pretty soon, and if you are into gaming, definitely go with larger than 16GB models. The web browsing performance has been increased as well, so you can browse the web more fluidly.ConclusionI am pretty happy with my purchase. The free iLife and iWork packages with the purchase of new iPad from Apple sealed the deal for me. It is much better than my previous iPad 3, and I definitely love the new reduced weight. The performance increase is also noticeable both in games and web browsing.

I am neither an apple/pc/android fanboy, I use the tool that gets the job done reliably. (Ever have a paper due and your computer breaks down?) I own a macbook, iphone, windows desktop, and had a Nexus 7 for a short time but wanted a tablet with a larger screen.So lets get down to it- initial impression was \"Wow!\" and I never realized how chunky or laggy the Nexus 7 was. The resolution, animations, user interface, and general build quality is superb in my opinion. It feels like a device \"that will get work done\". Unfortunately, the iPad out of the box feels like a digital storefront for the App store as opposed to something I can do school work on. Bluntly, the device is unnecessarily handicapped. For me to put my own videos on it, I have to use Handbrake and waste 3-4 hours to convert the movie to something the iPad can play. The Nexus 7 played almost any format out of the box. Using textbook PDFs is horrible, there are only a few quality apps that offer continuous scrolling. If your course requires mymathlabs, webassign, or one of those other edu-gimmicks to do homework, good luck, most of them require Flash which is unsupported. Then I went to use safari.. advertisements everywhere! Same with every free app, constant advertisements! Occasionally I have to download PDF to read for course work. Ain't happening in safari- there is no way to download and the page will refresh if you close the app. Good luck reading where there is no wifi.Then I jailbroke it, installed f.lux, adblockerNetworks, safari downloader, nitrous, retinapad, vplayer video player, and videopane. That took care of the blinding blue light at night time, killed off 90% of advertisements, I can download files now, iPhone only apps are now in HD, I can watch almost any format of video too. Now the device is useful!After that, I installed DocsToGo to read PDFs with continuous scrolling and to write papers. I also HIGHLY recommend Notes Plus if you intend on hand writing notes. Lastly, I would suggest getting the \"Papers\" app (no typo) to read PDFs with multiple columns.Overall, iPad has a lot of potential but is held back by Apples walled garden. After jailbreaking and eliminating the majority of the artificial handicaps, I feel OK with heading to school only with it and not worrying about it not being capable of doing something.

I own an iPad 2 and 3 and now this new iPad Air version. My main reasons for updating were that I literally fill up my 64 GIG iPad every day or two with videos and photos that I shoot. Having this larger version at 128 GIG allows me to work longer and add more to my iPad. In addition this new version is much lighter and easier to use all day long. Even though the battery is smaller in capacity than my iPad 3 the battery life is longer and it is very noticeable. This is because the faster A7 CPU and the motion chip actually use less power.Please watch my video as I go into more details in it.I immediately noticed the increase in speed. The unit connects to the WIFI faster, synchs with iTunes faster, downloads emails faster and speeds up your web browsing. The differences are very noticeable and enjoyable as a user. The dual speakers are a nice change but I also use a lot of Bluetooth speakers to enhance the sound of the iPad.In my video I do a size and weight comparison to an iPad 2, an iPad 3 and the iPad Air. I also show how the basic set up takes place and for advanced users you can just speed through that portion of the video. The iPad 2 weighs 1 pound 5 1/8 ounces, the iPad 3 weighs 1 pound 7 1/8 ounces, and the iPad Air weighs 1 pound and \u00bc ounce. The iPad Air is narrower but has the same screen size. The left and right edges of the iPad are thinner on the sides of the useable screen and you can see that in the video.Here are the key improvements for me:* Much lighter in weight* Thinner, smaller design with the same screen size* Much faster when synching with iTunes* Much faster when browsing the web* Much faster when downloading emails* Stronger WIFI connection and faster WIFI synching* A more powerful AC wall adapter with 5.2 VDC and an output of 2.4 Amps. It charges at 12 watts of power. It operates at 100 to 240 VAC and 50/60 Hz and it is UL approved. It features folding AC wall plugs for easy packing when traveling.* Lower CPU and motion chip power consumption that makes the smaller/lighter internal battery last longer! This is very noticeable!* As usual a beautiful high resolution retina screen with 2048 by 1536 resolution at 264 pixels per inch. You can see the difference in the photos, videos and reading quality of the screen.* Dual speakers in the bottom* Free high quality Apps* iPhoto* iMovie* GarageBand* Pages* Keynote* Remember to download these from Apple!Overall this is a superior product that really outperforms the older iPads that I have. I was disappointed that the new iPad Air did not have the home button with the fingerprint sensor built in. Since I have used it with my iPhone 5S I have really become attached to it and it just seems like a way to cheapen the unit and be more competitive instead of showing and using the enhanced technology. I would have paid a little more for the iPad Air with that sensor.This is still a 5 star product and I recommend it as a very good tablet.", "Date": "November 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very happy with the purchase", "Author": "Xiaodong Cheng", "ReviewID": "R39R44Y8UD95AG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is a beautiful unit, with solid construction, gorgeous display, and of course very light and thin compared with older models.

Others about the brightness...indeed I do have it cranked all the way up but the brightness is nowhere as bright as what is found on the Samsung Note 10.1 2014 edition, nor the iPad4 and my most recent purchase the Samsung Note 8. All 3 when cranked all the way up are much brighter than the iPad Air.I will be buying the new Google nexus 7(even with all the GPS and multi-touch issues) for the upcoming holidays but even in the store, that too seems much brighter...I am very dismayed at this lack of brightness from the Air but it is still more than adequate for indoors. I have not tried it outdoors nor will I as this is not my \"outdoor\" tablet...lol.I like Apple and the tight integration of their apps and the reason many including myself continue to buy their products. I do feel the price for this latest iteration is them trying to make money at our expense. WHO HERE DOES NOT KNOW IN THEIR HEART THAT APPLE IS TRYING TO GET IN ON THE CHRISTMAS RUSH AND PUT THE AIR AND THE NEW MINI WITHOUT THE FINGERPRINT FEATURES FOUND ON THE NEW IPHONE...COME MARCH MAYBE APRIL, APPLE WILL UPDATE THE IPAD AIR TO INCLUDE THAT FEATURE.I will continue to buy Apple mostly because their store has apps that are better, with more choices and work extremely well with their devices. I think this product is a 3 1/2 Stars at best and mostly for the size and weight reduction that is very significant. I feel the \"glass\" is too thin but seems to be durable as I have really been typing a lot on it as well as playing several games that require a lot of tapping. I am very happy with the size reduction but feel the brightness is not up to par with other new tablets or the iPad4.Recently the Safari browser has been \"crashing\" a lot over the past week in that when you tap on a hyperlink, the browser will basically disappear off the screen. None of the tabs close but it just disappears and returns you to the home screens. I also am finding the browser will get stuck/freeze for several minutes before resuming. I have several calls in with apple support and they are looking into the issues.Other issues is the VIDEO app, if you play a video via streaming not downloading and leave it somewhere like the middle or so on, it actually reduces your available memory by the amount you have watched from what I can glean. IT IS LIKE DOWNLOADING THE MOVIE TO THE POINT YOU HAVE WATCHED IT TO EVEN THOUGH YOU SELECTED THE STREAMING LINK. If you do this with several movies, you can basically wipe out your free memory. I find it difficult to clear the buffer and have basically learned to tell the app not to display any movies then to display movies then play the movie but move the slider to the beginning and press stop playing then done. Of these many steps I eventually clear the buffer but I am not sure which of all these steps actually is what does it if any!Oh lastly, the WI-fi is fantastic.FINAL RATING IS 3 1/2 STARS...MAYBE 4 IF NOT FOR THE BRIGHTNESS ISSUE.First I own iPad 2 and 4 and Samsung Note 10.1 2014 edition.I like...not love...the new iPad Air as it is faster both in operating the software apps and graphic intensive apps. The apps continue to be fantastic for all the pads not just the Air.Apple did a great job on the weight but FEEL STRONGLY THAT THE NEW SCREEN IS NOT NEARLY AS BRIGHT AS MY iPad 4 NOR DOES IT EVEN FEEL LIKE GLASS.As I type this review on the Air, the \"cheap tapping\" feel of this glass leaves me wondering how durable this glass is. It feels thin and makes a tapping sound not found on the more solid glass on my other two iPads.Oh I am keeping the Air for the faster processors but feel Apple has put out a product whose screen will not be as durable as prior pads.I can see it flex when I push down on it with minimal effort and have some light distortion when I press down like old type LED TVS.Apple over prices their products because they can and really did so on this iteration of their iPad. In my estimation the glass feels like plastic and the brightness is much diminished when compared to my iPad 4 and so must have a higher profit margin with all these cost cutting that resulted in a new iPad that for all practically purposes is just faster but not as solidly built as prior pads.Time will tell on the screen and maybe this is the way all tablets are headed to achieve the weight reduction and thinness. I love the ability to hold the Air in one hand comfortably for much longer than any of my current tablets. I am OK to sacrifice the glass quality as long as the touch screen does not suffer or long term screen reliability.I wish Apple would splurge and include a 6 foot charging cord...OMG $600 for 32GB and the cord is so short still after all this time...lol.", "Date": "November 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very nice hardware for the price! Lightweight, a joy to use", "Author": "Gearhead Mania", "ReviewID": "R3K3EAML83WH3K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using Android products mainly, but I first delved into touch devices with the first generation iPod Touch so I am familiar with iOS to an extent. For the past few years I've used Android FroYo, Gingerbread, Ice Cream Sandwich, and now Jelly Bean. I also have a Kindle Fire HD. The iPad Air is my first iPad, and I chose to go with the iPad Air because it has a much higher resolution than the best Android Tablets, with a really slick dual-core CPU and quad-core GPU. The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 is a close second but is more expensive than the iPad Air which was on sale during a Black Thursday promotion. The Galaxy Tab 3 just doesn't even come close with the screen resolution.The iOS 7 interface is OK. I prefer Jelly Bean's interface. Although clean and simple, the iOS interface isn't intuitive. There are too many sub-menus interwoven in odd areas. To change language, I have to go into no less than 2 sub-menu layers. Siri is fine, but Google Now/Google Search was far more intelligent and effective. Siri's default US female voice is much more realistic and smoother, but Google Now's other voices along with IVONA rectify that situation fairly well.The battery life on the iPad Air is very good. After an hour or so, I'm still above 90%. The WiFi is fast, and the overall UI is smooth. The movie/graphics playback is super fast. I can watch Flash based movies/video within the Safari browser without any hiccups.Compared to my 7 inch Kindle Fire HD, I felt that the 9.7 inch (Air's display size) or 10 inch screen size is just right, but only because the iPad Air is extremely thin and lightweight. The 7 inch KFHD is large enough to be usable for reading magazines, but it is not a good use of space. I have to flick through 2 or 3 screens while the iPad Air will show the entire page (in a very legible font size) in one screen. The KFHD is also heavy, so hopefully the new KFHDX is thinner and lighter.I used to make fun of Apple for going with the Lightning connector, but after using it up close, I can understand why it is innovative. It is made out of a solid chunk of metal with contacts on both sides. There's no \"right\" way of plugging it in, unlike USB where I constantly flip it around trying to figure out which side is up. But I still feel micro-USB is the right way to go, due to its universal acceptance with devices. The included 12W power adapter can actually charge the iPad Air at up to 14W of power based on what I saw with my Kill-A-Watt.With respect to the hardware and design, the iPad Air is outstanding at this price point. Aside from the hardware, the bulk of the iPad Air and Apple experience centers around iTunes, iCloud, and other Apple software. This is an area where I feel Google far surpasses Apple. The Apple ID system is cumbersome and annoying to use. I had to login probably a dozen times during the registration process, and buying/installing free apps required me to enter my password each time. It didn't seem like all of Apple's programs were tightly integrated because I had to use my Apple ID each time I fired up the apps for the first time. Once everything was setup and installed, it seemed fine. That said, installing and running Google's apps on the iPad was significantly less painful. The first time I used my Google account for an app (I believe it was YouTube), all of the other Google Apps recognized me and started syncing. Google Now/Google Search also puts Siri to shame, albeit Siri seems more \"human\" with basic functions. For instance, asking about the weather, Siri actually told me (In Chinese and English) that the weather wasn't very good at 27F. Doing basic searches, Siri and Google Now are about equal, but Google Now seems more intelligent with some of the intermediate activities like unit conversions or advanced searches.I never liked iTunes in the past, and my opinion has not changed with ITunes 11. It is overly complex to use. With Google/Android, I can access Play with a browser and have new apps sent to my devices with the greatest of ease. Syncing calendar events, email, contacts, etc... is also far easier with just using a browser versus the iTunes program on my PC. The good news is that iTunes isn't too bad to use on the iPad. Running Zinio, Conde Naste magazine apps, and other apps was smooth and problem-free.For those that like to use their tablet for browsing or reading magazines, or watching videos, I'd highly recommend a 10 inch display (the Air is 9.7\" but falls in the range). My 7 inch Kindle Fire is fine to use, but it is frustrating to use for magazines due to the amount of panning that is needed. After using the iPad Air, my Samsung Galaxy S3 feels claustrophobic with its 4.9\" display.Overall: 5/5 stars, the iPad Air is a well-designed device with great hardware especially with the Black Thursday/Friday promotions. However, Apple has a lot of catching up to do with respect to its software designs. I very much prefer Google's ecosystem as it is more \"cloud-based\" than what Apple is trying to do.

However, when I travel, I will use a 5 oz cover or just a Smart Cover (3.5 oz).I know it can be dangerous, not using a case, but I am extremely careful and i bought the special Apple warranty.

I told we would both have to download Skype to teleconference with eachother and she said forget it. too much trouble.  then I'd have to buy new extra chargers/cables etc. just too much incompatibility. so I returned it and bought this and I'm thrilled and happy with it. if I wasn't used to Apple products I would have kept the the Kindle. just being honest as I don't want anyone to think that the Kindle wasn't good", "Date": "November 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Disappointed first time apple customer", "Author": "Ginfx", "ReviewID": "R3PXX0AJCUBKMP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was excited to purchase my first apple product. This unit was purchased from another retailer as part of a bundle and offered flexible payments. I was looking at the Air laptop, but then heard iPad air was coming out.  Sadly it will be going back.  iPad air is thin, lightweight, perfect size screen.The color is super sharp.  Super fast typing and going from app to app,, when it wanted to work. Which meant I really couldn't tell you if they worked well or not.  I'd only had it for a day and the screen froze.  Could only go back to the home screen, then loose any work one might have done. Couldn't turn it off. Then, when I was getting ready to put it back in the box, amazingly it decided to work. The set-up wizard was super fast helping this technically challenged person set up and link  all her accounts.  I REALLY liked that it was a tablet and a small laptop as it came with an awesome keypad. So then I started downloading music and wanted to hear the small ball speaker that came in the bundle. The female plug in the air was not quite the right size. I couldn't get a snug fit, also tried with the ear buds and another speaker. And as I fidgeted with the plugs to get a secure connection to receive a signal, the song would stop playing and the volume on the screen kept going up and down. Is this supposed to happen???? As for the sound, I wasn't expecting much from such a thin tablet. The speakers were on the back side but I'm not sure if speakers could be placed in the front. But since the speaker plugs won't fit, what's the point? You'd need to buy some blue-tooth speakers to really hear better soundIt would be hard for me to compare the ipad air to other tablets as this would have been my first touch-screen device other than my android smart phone.I'd have to agree with previous reviews. I also feel this device was rushed on the market before X-mas. With the screen freezing and the plug being poorly made, is a good indication of frantically putting something together and getting it on the market for the holidays. I really hope that the next generation iPad air will be greatly improved as I really like apple products,and software, and was hoping this would be the first.Apple, I am disappointed. You can do a lot better.

The need for both color for children's books and my own need for a white background to provide contrast when reading were my primary motivators.  The price and versatility of the Kindle were better than other options available.  I do not use my device as a media player, but that seemed to be a nice option.  However, my spouse insisted I look at the \"Apple iPad Air\" before I made any purchase.After looking at the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" and the \"Apple iPad Air\" side-by-side in the big electronics retailer, I had to admit it, he was right!  Clarity on both devices was excellent, particularly as I intended to use the item primarily as an e-reader.  However, the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" kept freezing up; the blue shirted employees said that was a frequent occurrence.  The \"Apple iPad Air\" connected easily to WiFi and navigation was smooth and seamless.  The ability to use many of the same programs I have installed on my PC is a plus.  Downloading books is quick and the \"Apple iPad Air\" does not bog down so that it seems painfully slow when I try to change from a book to the main menu page.  Using the \"Apple iPad Air\" is intuitive, even for those individuals - like me -who are not especially tech-savvy.  Based on recommendations and the fact that I would use the tablet when traveling, I purchased the \"Apple iPad Air\" 16 GB with the ability to connect to AT&T.;The principle downside of purchasing the \"Apple iPad Air\" is its initial cost.  Individuals who are debating between purchasing a Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" and an \"Apple iPad Air\" should look at the two side-by-side; consider their primary uses and personal preferences; and evaluate the price difference in light of those factors.  While I don't like having to admit my spouse was right, I do love my \"Apple iPad Air\".

She had been using an earlier iPad so was already familiar with tablet technology.  She uses it for reading, checking email, web browsing, and for taking videos of our grandson during his wrestling matches.  For some reason, iPads are popular among moms and grand moms for taking wrestling videos.  She then transfers the videos to her MacBook Pro, writes them to an optical disc and gives it to the coach for analysis.  Video transfers are achieved when she syncs the iPad Air with her MBP.  She keeps it protected in a pink Otterbox, which gives the iPad a completely different look and feel.iPad Air is thinner and lighter than previous iPads and comes with a sharp Retina display.  I don't know if it's the best tablet for your money.  I do know she keeps it close at all times, and though she doesn't qualify as a geek she's worked in software maintenance most of her professional life.  If she were unhappy with it she wouldn't use it.

Or maybe the Enterprise from the future brought it back to Apple and said here. Enjoy.But seriously, the build quality is wonderful. As light and thin as this tablet is it still feels solid and sturdy. The screen is beautiful and the colors are deep and rich. The colors are actually noticeably better than the first and second generation minis. I've held them side by side and there is a pretty wide gap between the two in terms of richness of color. The ipad air looks vibrant and robust with deep blacks and warm bold colors.Plus it's very fast. I loaded up GT Racing 2 last night and it ran flawlessly fast and looked absolutely gorgeous. I couldn't believe how sharp the cars looked and the backgrounds had such depth. I should stop writing and go play right now.Despite the other great tablets like the Nexus 7 and 10 or the Samsung Galaxies 8 and 10 the ipad air is in another realm. A realm all to itself.

There were some bugs that cropped up with the Safari browser with the final iOS update, causing the iPad to crash. These have been widely reported. Apple did not take the effort to fix them. I guess it was upgrade or deal with slow response and repeated crashing. Having had it for two years I did not feel Apple stood behind their product for very long.Anyway, this iPad Air is fantastic. It operates smoothly without crashing. the LTE downloads quickly, just like my iPhone 5 which I had often turned to when my old iPad couldn't handle the job.If you have been waiting to upgrade, this is a huge step up from any of the older models.

Performance wise I do a lot of multi tasking and it doesn't even break a sweat. The picture is brilliant very clear and crisp. The size and structure are amazing light and beautiful very sharp. It fits in your hands like a glove. It has a great camera for a tablet you wouldn't believe the pictures I have taken with this thing I get a lot if compliments all the time. As for its competitors the samsung note 10.1 2014 edition, the structure of this ipad blows it away. Know Samsung has its own perks that Apple doesn't offer but I would still say its a fair superior product then the note. That being said I do own a galaxy s4 smart phone and I absolutely love it I just prefer my phone to have a bigger screen,and it has it's other perks as well. mainly the galaxy gear watch sealed the deal for me.

Is it the best tablet for you?", "Author": "John Ryan", "ReviewID": "R99F4BEOZO0JF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The new iPad Air is Apple's latest, slimmest, lightest release of their hand-held computer. Oddly enough, it's so beautifully easy to use (my one year old daughter loves playing with it), it's almost doesn't feel like a computer at all.A word of warning - this review is written for people who've never owned an iPad before - and are wondering what all the fuss is about. If you're thinking of upgrading skip down to the \"What's great about the Air\" section below, or just buy it - it's amazing.Just what's all the fuss about?--------------------------------------I used to own a laptop for work, and (very occasionally), it'd sit on my lap on the sofa, and I'd use it for pleasure (eMail, watching films or playing the odd game). Then I bought my first iPad, and the laptop became redundant, a boring \"work device\". Hard to explain, but the fact the iPad is so small and light, and you navigate around with your finger by pointing and gently swiping the screen makes the whole experience a lot easier - a lot more fun.Even my most \"luddite\" of friends have been won over.It's incredibly simple and easy to use (it only has one main button), and everyone from my one year old daughter to my 85 year old dad have taken to without problems. It's size and shape also support using it like a book (literally to read a book or web page), but you can also watch TV and films.Personally I'm also paranoid about my password getting \"hacked\", and someone running up a huge Amazon bill or buying stuff with my credit card on eBay. Well one of the benefits of the iPad (and iPhone) is it's \"almost impossible\" to get a virus - one of the most common ways to get hacked. This doesn't mean you shouldn't use strong passwords, (both Sony and Adobe got hacked), but it's reassuring to leave the Windows world behind.Finally, I love the way these devices (iPad, iPhone, Apple TV, Apple Mac), increasingly work together. The fact you can start a Pages document on your Mac and edit it on your iPad, or take photos on the iPhone, and in seconds see them on the iPad or Mac and display them on the Apple TV.The thing is, \"it just works\".What would you use if for?----------------------------------* Shopping online. Obviously - you could be reading a review on Amazon about the iPad Air!* Reading web pages. As you can hold it like a book it's great to read the news online (my wife loves the Daily Mail Online).* Reading Books. It's great for reading books from Amazon Kindle or Apple Books with the benefit of 1,000s of online book reviews* Navigating web pages. Instead of clicking with a mouse, you gently swipe your fingers on screen to scroll around* Watching Films. I use it to watch Netflix online videos (with an Apple TV you can send stuff to the telly)* Watching TV. With the free BBC iPlayer app you can catch up or download BBC programs* Reading and replying to mail. I use \"mailbox\" a great free app to read and reply to mails, but there's a free one included* Showing and organising photos. Any photos on an iPhone are automatically available within minutes in \"the cloud\"* Playing games. From fun puzzle games like \"Cut the Rope\" to fully fledged first person shooters.* Listening to the Radio. With \"Tune in Radio\" you can listen to thousands of radio stations world-wide.* Listening to music. I stream mine to an Apple TV, but you can also buy portable speakers or just plug into the AUX socket* Editing Word, Excel and Powerpoint documents using FREE App \"QuickOffice\" (owned and supported by Google).* Editing Pages, Numbers and Keynote documents (Office for the Apple) on the FREE Apple apps.* The list goes on and on.Update: You can edit Word, Excel and Powerpoint documents (plus Pages, Numbers and Keynote) on the iPad (although I'd recommend an external keyboard - see below). It's definately powerful enough, although I'd not expect these apps to cope with REALLY complex document layouts. Great for general letter and document writing though.Which model should I buy?----------------------------------I can't comment about Android tablets (apart from the Google Nexus 7 which is well regarded), but in terms of the Apple tablet line-up in order of cost:-1. Avoid the Apple iPad 2, it's a relatively old model, under-powered and with a lower resolution screen. If you really want an Apple but don't want to spend the cash, buy a 16g WIFI 3rd or 4th generation iPad from eBay. Avoid this one.2. iPad mini is a lovely tablet. A 7.9 inch screen and astonishingly light and remarkably thin - it feels like a light-weight book.3. iPad mini with retina screen. Again 7.9 inch screen, but with the blazingly fast A7 chip and a \"retina\" (high definition) screen. Worth the upgrade if you can afford it.4. iPad Air. Much larger screen size (9.7 inches - doesn't sound much but it makes a huge difference). Same fast (A7) chip as the Mini with Retina - the latest and fastest iPad available.Clearly (from my viewpoint) there's only really three options. The iPad Mini, the Mini with retina screen and Air.What are the Optional add-ons?-----------------------------------------Well, assuming you've dropped by the Apple Store or John Lewis (which I would highly recommend), and handled the iPad Mini (with/without retina screen), and iPad Air then your options are around memory size and cellular option.Memory: Once bought, you can't add memory (space for apps, films, books etc). However, the basic price goes up a huge amount (+\u00a380 for the 16g to 32g iPad Air). But, having owned a 16g and then a 32g iPad - I can safely recommend the 16g unless you really want to store a huge amount of videos and downloads. Only you can decide, and if you're lucky enough that money is no object then splash out. Otherwise, 16g should be fine for most people.Celular: Allows you to connect to the internet while you're out and about. This will add an additional +\u00a3100 to the price and means you can slip in a mobile phone SIM card. This means (for an additional \u00a37-15 a month extra), you can access the internet on the move. Alternatively, you can opt for the WIFI option, and use it at home or at at \"hot spot\" (eg. Starbucks, most rail stations and hotels etc).Personally I'd buy (and indeed did), the 16Gb iPad Air WIFI.Do I need anything else?-------------------------------Most people (me included) buy a cover. Apple (and now several copy-cats) make a \"smart-cover\" which automatically shuts down the iPad when you close it, and switches it on when you open it. There's versions which cover the back, or just the screen. Apple charge from \u00a335 to \u00a365 for their (admittedly) high quality fabric or leather covers, but there's many available from \u00a310. Be aware, you do get what you pay for.Personally,I think it's a pity to cover the beautiful aluminium industrial design of the iPad with a cover - but if you've spent hundreds of pounds you'll want to protect it from scrapes and bangs.I also invested in a keyboard (\u00a325-80), as I tend to write a lot of mails and documents (remember it comes with a word processor). I'd recommend the Logitech Ultra Thin iPad Air Case with Keyboard - Space Greyand the ZAGG Keys iPad Air Case Folio with Backlit Keyboard - Black although these are strictly optional unless you want to use your iPad as a proper laptop.Finally, if you have another Apple device (eg. an iPhone, Apple TV or Mac) you'll find these work together beautifully. For example, you can create a reminder on your iPad and it appears on your iPhone. Equally, photos taken on your iPhone appear on your iPad, and you can stream music or videos from iPad, iPhone or Mac to an Apple TV.Some people think this \"locks you in\" - but it's your choice.What's great about the Air?-----------------------------------* Lighter (30%) and thinner than the previous version (469g from 650g)* Even faster A7 chip. Blazingly fast!* Improved sound (compared to the iPad 4)* Software including+ iMovie - edit and publish home made movies+ Numbers - Fully functional Excel for the iPad+ Pages - Word processor+ GarageBand - Play a piano or a drum kit+ iPhoto - Edit and organise your photosWhat's not so great?--------------------------* The change in physical size means you'll need a new keyboard or replacement cover if you're upgrading* Pity Apple didn't include the \"touch ID\" to secure your passwordsOverall Opinion---------------------It's hard to believe the iPad version 1 was released just four years ago, and there's a huge raft of \"me too\" tablet computers to choose from, but the Apple iPad Air is still the one to beat. As \"Which?\" magazine (in the UK) put it - \"...the best tablet we've ever tested. Apple packs a beautiful screen and lightning fast processor into a slimmer-than-ever shell, and battery life is very impressive\".Yes, there are cheaper Android based alternatives, but the quality, design and beauty of this tablet just sets it apart. If it were a car it'd be a top of the range Mercedes or a BMW.Highly Recommended.", "Date": "February 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Apple does it again", "Author": "Robert Garner", "ReviewID": "R2A8NVDAH0DGG5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is not my first iPad.

The big thing is I've always liked the iPad as a concept but I've never fully fallen in love. I bought an original iPad, 2, and 3 but ended up selling them not long after because of a couple reasons. Mainly they just felt a bit like a luxury item I didn't have much use for and they weighed just enough to be uncomfortable to hold for a long period.The weight is now a complete non-issue. I fall back in love with it every time I pick it up because it just feels so perfectly designed for being held and interacted with. It also feels like much more than a luxury because of how much usability it now has. There are so dang many things I can do on my iPad, things I used to need my pc to complete. This is partly because of improvements by Apple but its also the simple benefit of web and app developers designing their services with mobile in mind.I can only imagine this comes off as a completely biased review but know I didn't get this device expecting to be so happy with it.

Young", "ReviewID": "R11CXF8RPTZQJW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased the IPAD air last week. When I tried to activate my accounts it would not allow it because apparently since I changed carriers I could not use my old Apple ID because it is tied to the old carrier. I can't establish a new Apple ID because I have an old one and if they delete the old one I lose all the apps I've paid for. I contacted Apple Technical where I was required to purchase tech support before they would do anything.  After doing this I went through multiple calls with multiple levels of support over three days so far with more to come. Seems that if the tech makes a mistake it stops the process and you have to wait 24 hours for them to be able to continue. They promise to call back and so far they have not so I called them to start the frustrating cycle all over again. I can't get the apps I want until this if fixed. I also can't connect to Facebook. For a machine this expensive plus having to pay for tech support for something that is Apple's fault I now believe Apple products aren't worth the gas to go buy one. I've been using Apples since the Apple Plus and I feel abused as a customer for the IPAD AIR. On top of all this they just had the gall to send me an email thanking me for contacting Apple Support. They have charged me for something a user should be able to do online with a new machine that is supposed to be the latest and greatest and it is just a paper weight right now. Can't return it because there is nothing wrong with it. Seems to me Apple is unethical and does not care about customers after a purchase.

If you have doubts shoot me a comment, I can help!Having used several tablets, I like the hardware weight and screen resolution of iPAD Air. It takes 3-4 years for a tablet maker to reach an acceptable level. All previous full size iPADs were heavy for me. I won't go into details of iOS7 itself. I am also disappointed Apple has GPS only on 4G models. The apps and security of iOS platform is generally good. What I don't like is the iTunes way of syncing up. Not a USB drap and drop. This is the primary reason for me giving a 4 stars. Android trumps in this regard.Overall being a geek, I like all makers. I don't bias and want Apple to succeed. Success of Apple will propel Google and other makers of tablets. My wishlist is to try a a Windows tablet once they get through a iteration cycle in late 2014.Overall iPAD is a delightful tablet as long as you accept its limitations.

Apple keeps getting so close, in some ways, yet so far away in others. Please let me explain.First, an iPad is overall a great piece of hardware. The iPad Air is lighter, thinner, and faster than all other tablet devices on the market. However, it does come with a few issues that leaves me hesitant to give more than a rating of 3 stars. Please let me explain.First off, Apple is notorious of fleecing every penny you have out of you. It isn't just the brand name or the product quality.For those that remember the days when buying a Nintendo Entertainment System (NES for short), what did you get in that box? You got the connector cable to the TV, you got not just one but two controllers, a light zapper gun (Duck Hunt anyone?), and up to three games that came included all in one box.What does Apple doe? Let's see. You have to buy a screen protector (separately) a protecting case (separately) connectors to a TV (separately) a stylus (separately), etc. etc. even if you get a good Black Friday deal somewhere, you can end up almost spending the same or more of a cost on a used car versus the cost of the iPad with all the extras you end up being required to buy on your own. You also get another additional $99.00 charge for a very limited (basically only a 1 time only use) AppleCare warranty plan.Also, there is the hardware. I know Apple is known to hold back a bit and choose stable hardware versus the latest greatest things out there. I get that. However, there are a number of areas Apple slacked on A LOT on the iPad Air.1. It still uses a USB 2.0 connection over a connection to your PC. Even if your PC has a USB 3.0 port, the iPad Air still only transfers data at USB 2.0 speed (a snail's pace by comparison).2. The battery in the iPad Air is actually half the size of the battery in the iPad 4. Despite claims of optimizations and so-on, Apple has still refused to spend some of the billions they earn each year on actual real research and development on a longer lasting battery with a much longer amount of juice. You shouldn't have to run to the nearest plug-in jack every few feet to recharge the thing. Likewise, am I the only one that realizes that solar charger calculators have existed since the 70's? If Apple would simply put a slightly larger sized battery inside the iPad, with a solar charger built into the case itself, no one would ever need to plug it in again to recharge it. As how very dated solar chargers are for small electronics, there is no excuse for not having it.3. The iPad was recently boosted in storage capacity from the former max 64GB to the current 128GB model. I do appreciate that. What I don't appreciate it just how many years the 64GB max storage model existed and how many years it took Apple to raise storage capacity. As fast as technology advances, we should have at least 512GB or even 1TB storage on an iPad. Consider that desktop PCs can have a 6 to 8 and soon to be 10TB storage capacity, a minor 512GB or 1 single TB of storage space should be no issue for Apple to provide, especially since Apple still offers no micro-SD slot for adding more storage capacity.Finally, I will say, I find it very inconsiderate, rude, and showing true colors on just how far Apple is in bed with Obama, the White House, the police state, and the National Security Agency (NSA). Just look up the Part 2 of Infect and Protect video by Jacob Appelbaum. About half-way through the video, he shows with official NSA slides that proves they have a 100% chance to be able to turn on any Apple device, i.e. iPad, IPhone, etc. They can turn on the microphone when you are not using it, they can also activate the camera to take photos of you, all with everyone around being left completely unaware. They have full access to your contact lists, including the complete addresses and phone numbers of all of your contacts, have access to all of your passwords, all of your email, all of your Google searches, and much more. Unfortunately, Apple decided to give in and join the PRISM program after Steve Jobs died. When that happened, any possible minor chance of any privacy, freedom, or liberty any owner of any Apple iDevice had, went right out the window. Could Apple have done their part to protect its customers? Yes, and very easily. The could have chosen to encrypt all user information and data stored at Apple and in the iCLoud. They could have been respectable and NOT give the FBI, CIA, NSA, or anyone else 100% universal backdoor access keys of their customer's devices. They could have added a completely free open-source plug-in offered by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) called HTTPS-Everywhere into Safari on iDevices, preventing web traffic from being intercepted, by using a SSL connection everywhere, instead of use the very unsafe standard HTTP connection on the web. They could built into iOS a 2 form of authentication, instead of just a small 4 character password. They could have built access directly to the Tor network for full free anonymity. Apple did none of this, and it would have costed the very little in time and resources to implement. Until Apple grows up and starts fighting for the privacy, liberty, and freedom on their customers, I cannot in good faith suggest anyone buy an Apple Product again.", "Date": "April 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice increase in speed,", "Author": "Mike60", "ReviewID": "R1QHQO5QBVHQFP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "light and fast, easy too hold, screen is very nice.

No problems with my wife's iPad2.  I've tried several sounds to announce an email, and when I tried the duck quack I can never change it or shut is off. It's so annoying I quit watching Duck Dynasty! Also, when an email arrives you have to scroll to the most recent, it doesn't do it automatically. The worst problem was ignoring my touches, even though the icon would highlight, indicating it recognized my touch. However, when I did the software update a few days ago the touch problem went away and always recognizes my touch.The biggest issue is once you build your life around one of these monsters it has you for the rest of your life. You cannot live with out it. Carrying mine to a hardware dealer 55 miles away to use a coupon that wouldn't print out saved me $70, as it was still on the screen at the check stand. If left on all night in the sleep mode it only uses about 1% of the battery charge.A couple days ago  I stumbled into an iPad chat and some guru suggested doing a \"reset\" to cure the locked on duck quack, that did the trick. I also saw I wasn't alone with this problem.  However the command said it wouldn't change any of  of your stored data, but I later found it deleted several critical, most used passwords, and I had to track down  my list.

I cannot comment on a previous poster's comment that the screen is not as bright, but the display is plenty bright for me when I need it to be.Typing on the tablet does feel a little different than before, but I do not think it feels like it's going to break. I actually prefer typing on the new one. It is difficult to explain, but I suggest trying it out in store if you are seriously concerned about the feel.Overall, I would definitely recommend this tablet (especially if you are tied to the iOS ecosystem).

It doesn't have all those add-ons that one in one hundred users would use, which would make it weight as much as the surface or a garden brick.It's a five star device.

There are 3 little air pillows around it. That is ALL YOU GET, period. I never even opened up the cloth bag to look at the actual Ipad so I will assume that the \"with plastic\" means there is the thin plastic screen protector, in place. I will never know because I didn't open the cloth bag. Its true that there is ''no box'' but there will also be no instruction booklet, no USB cable, and no charger. (seller later told me he would send these accessories, which normally come with a \"New\" Ipad air-.One can merely speculate what happened to the originals. I had  assumed from the original Ad that the only thing that would be missing was the original box. Also, I was a little surprised when an email from the seller said \"iPad its brand New, it cover under apple's limited warranty.Model Verizon - put a sim card and use anywhere\"---thats a cut and paste.......The surprises just kept on coming.
