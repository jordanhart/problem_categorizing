After charging it her mother tried to set it up. Didn't get far so called customer support. She had to reset it about 4 times before it responded. It still was not responsive to touch and took 2-3 times trying different ways to touch it before it would respond. Then it was very slow. She got very frustrated. I took my Kindle Fire for her to try and it was great. She got it registered, games downloaded and parental controls set in a short time. I ordered another Kindle for myself and returned the Zeki Tablet the next day. I do not recommend it.", "Date": "September 28, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00CKE5YGY"}}
