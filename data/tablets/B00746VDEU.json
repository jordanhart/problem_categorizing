I opened the iPad box to discover...no protective plastic over the accessories and the screen, and a few hand prints over the iPad. I contacted WOW and it looks like they \"accidentally\" sent me a used one, when it's pretty blatant all over the order if you purchase a new or used one. Thankfully they provided a FedEx shipping label to return so I could exchange the used iPad for a new one. UNFORTUNATELY, despite them having my credit card information and charging it twice, they did not want to ship me the iPad first before me returning it (I use this for work so it's a hassle to get rid of and return it and wait again). So I dropped it off at the nearest FedEx only to become nervous again as they said they couldn't provide any receipt. It's been almost a week now since I've dropped off the package, with no tracking label or confirmation code and I've yet to hear form WOW what the status is of my new iPad. It's either a sketchy business trying to rid themselves of their used iPads or they're too 'lax and let silly mistakes happen in shipping.", "Date": "October 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "The new Ipad 3", "Author": "TheMan", "ReviewID": "RH4J2EOS6TMLA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had the new Ipad for almost 3 weeks now. I've downloaded lots of apps, use it for business meetings, play HD games on it, take pictures in different settings, use it to stream videos, watch my own videos on it, do some ppt presentations on it, use MSWord and Excell documents on it, read some iBooks on it, put the battery into constant abuse to see how long it last and I gotta tell ya, I'm pretty much impressed! But I do have a few cons about this tablet. And now I will list my pros and cons below.PROS & CONS:1.  Retina display is stunning! I have view wallpapers, photos, videos(my own uploaded & streaming)and it looks incredibly sharp and crisp.  I have some photos that were taken during a trip to SF Bay a few months back and forgot to bring my Cannon DSLR camera so we took some pictures with my wife's little samsung handheld 8mp camera.  When these photos loaded onto my laptop they look ugly, blurry, and pixelated but when I had them transfer to the new Ipad to view...wow they look great (not amazing, but great). The retina display help the photos to shine!  I've also uploaded the movie \"The Lorax and Acts of Valor\" to the new Ipad and even at 720p, the pictures looks stunning.  Then I stream movies from Netflix and Amazon and the pictures looks even more stunning.  Last week we went to a hiking trip and I took some pictures with the Ipad's camera.  I was a little skeptical due to the fact that it didn't have a built in flash, but when I view the pictures both on the new Ipad and my laptop, I was amazed how good the pictures look (it makes me wanted to take it to walmart and have it printed).  I even test the display laying down and try viewing from the side and the picture still looks stunning.  Overall, the Retina display on the new Ipad is topnotch and you will love it! Definately a PRO!2.  Performance wise, the Ipad is a quard core (4X) processor and with only 1g of internal graphics memory I don't really have much issues with it.  I have had a few crashes with some apps but I believe it's due to the app.  I have run apps that are processor hungry such as Air Supremacy and Garageband without a glitch.  I know with any tablet, you will experience some problems and the Ipad 3 is no exception.  I only wish apple put a 6 cores and 2g of memory inside but that would up the price too. Neither PRO or CON.3.  Responsiveness, the touch screen response pretty quick with my fingers but I'm using a stylus pen and depends on how hard the tip of your stylus pen is sometimes the screen won't register.  You will need to push a little harder. Still a PRO!4.  Productivity, with any tablet you buy it because you want it to use it for work and play, right?  Well, I have work with the new Ipad and play with it and this is how I feel.  I've used it to take notes during a meeting (I'm the notetaker) using just the app \"Note\" with a bluetooth keyboard and I was able to keep up with the meeting.  Pretty impressive! I have use it to give out speeches using ppt slideshow and able to use and edit MSWord on the tablet.  Even if I have to use third party apps to be able to use ppt and words, it runs great and very impressive!  I've used the tablet to remote controll my laptop and wow it runs smoothly without a glitch.  I was able to download some of the files I needed to my new Ipad within minutes!  You can access ONLive, Dropbox, etc. on the tablet without any issues.  Reading on the new Ipad is great also.  The letters on the screen is truly crisp, clear and sharp and I gotta say it's the best compare to any tablet on the market now (Even with the new Asus Infinety TF700).  PLAYTIME! Games, Games and Games!  I've downloaded tons of games, bowling, Angry birds, hockey, fruit ninja, pool, DH reloaded, Riptide, Dark Me, FLcommando, Dead Trigger, Juggernaut, GT HD, Air Supremacy, Metalstorm, F18 Carrier, Gunships, Blood and Glory, Infinety blade, and many more that I've played and deleted.  The games looks stunning on the new Ipad and it plays well (especially Air Supremacy, wow you gotta check out the graphics on that game!). THIS IS MOST DEFINATELY A PRO!5.  Well, every tablet has it goods and bads and it's no exception for Apple's new Ipad.  I have the screen brightness at \"AUTO\" and in my opinion I don't think the battery lasted long enough. It lasted about 6.5 to 7 hours for me.  This made me want to get the Asus Infinety TF700 with the keyboard dock.  I went to bestbuy to ask them why didn't the new Ipad support flash and they gave me a bunch of bullship excuses.  Well it's APPLE! They want to be different!  I really wish that my wallpapers could be a moving background like all the android tablets.  NO ANIMATED BACKGROUNDS - a bummer for me!  NO microSD card slots, HDMI, or anything else except your power button, wake, and volume buttons.  And it will cost me an arm and a leg to get accessories/adapters for the new Ipad to be able to stream (HDMI) movies to my HD TV, shoot my ppt presentation on a screen, transfer photos/videos to and from my new Ipad.  And most of all, I can not expand my internal storage cuz NO microSD card!  I bought (well...my wife bought it for me.  What a nice wife I have!) the 32g Ipad and with all the apps, movies, videos, photos I have already I'm down to 7g of memory left.  Darn! should have told her that I wanted the 64g!6.  Other CONS that I have are, IT GETS HOT! as hot as my 3 year old laptop.  The new Ipad can be a heater for winter (although the new Ipad might freeze during winter).  Do not put your Ipad in the car!  It does not like heat!  Even under the seat it will overheat, it likes to breath just like you and me.  It's like why would you lock your animal or kids in a warm summer car.  Same concepts here people! why would you lock your Ipad in a hot summer car.  When you play intense games or run application hungry apps it will get hot and you will notice it.  Another gripe, I mean CON.  What $#R@# is the use of a facing camera that takes pictures or video that looks like VHS quality.  All these tablet companies that have a little wimpy low resolution facing camera on their tablet need to go and do more research.  If you're willing to put a 8MP camera on the back might as well put one in the front.  I want to look stunning when I facetime with friends and family.  It's an advertisement gig! LOOK GOOD on camera to show the world they will come and buy your product!  PUT a decent camera on the front!7. And LAST but not LEAST!  I was very happy that the next system upgrade on the new Ipad, Apple will finally have SIRI on the new Ipad.  Well...at least I will have a woman to talk to when my wife is not home.  I just hope Apple don't use a man instead! better yet, give options to choose man or woman or an alien.  I guess, after all the PROS and CONS and gripes it all comes down to one last question.  DO I RECOMMEND PEOPLE TO BUY THE NEW IPAD 3?  Yeah...yeah! If you have the cash ($499 and up) or if you have a beautiful and very nice wife that would buy one for you.  \" GO AHEAD MAKE YOUR DAY!

Dean \"John\"", "ReviewID": "R3918O293VNU9W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I started with the original Kindle - I love reading, and an ebook reader was a lot better than reading on my old Windows Mobile 6 phone.  Then the Kindle 2 came out, and I upgraded to that.  I found that most of my reading was done laying in bed before going to sleep, and I was getting tired of having a little lamp clamped to the Kindle.  When the first iPad came out, I sneered at it.  I've done tablet PC's since their inception back in 2004, and had no plans on buying one.  But after playing with one at a local brick and mortar, I grabbed a 16GB version and brought it home.  30 Minutes later, I returned it for the 32GB version since I knew 16 would never be enough.  Gave the kindle to my mother.  Then when iPad 2 came out, I gave my 7 year old son the old one and got the new.  Now that the third gen is out, I gave my son my iPad2, my mom the iPad 1, and am enjoying the third generation immensely.The processor step each time was very noticeable - even for something simple like changing orientation in iBooks.  The convenience of checking mail while i'm reading, or doing quick searches on the web when I come across something I'm reading that I want to look into a little more, it's like having the options on my laptop but in an easy to use anywhere form factor.Since I can find wireless pretty much anywhere I go, there was no need for any version other than just the WiFi one.The screen is incredible.  The resolution if notably different, much like the iPhone 4 was when it was released.  It was the screen more than anything that made me get the iPhone 4 when it came out (was my first iPhone), and seeing it on the larger tablet format is just stunning.  And it's not just photos or movies that it looks good, since I don't do much of either on here, but everything else, even just the text while reading.  Everything is just crisper and much easier on the eye.Having spent the majority of my almost 45 years scoffing at Apple, and not buying anything they offered until almost 3 years ago, it's quite a change for me.  The app store makes it so easy to find things (almost too easy, like how it's so easy to spend money at Amazon).  Most items I can install on all my devices (3 iPads and 2 iPhones now) as long as they don't require in app purchases.The screen is easy to use, the touch component works great.  The only downside is the handwriting - even with apps designed for it and styli, it's not anything as good as the Microsoft tablet platform.  Which leaves the on screen keyboard for input, which works alright, but just not as easy or quick as a full screen keyboard for those of us who touch type.Fortunately I have a Macbook Pro so I can charge it from USB, but I also have several speaker docks, a few alarm clock docks, so there's plenty of options.  But it does not charge on my son's laptop or all in one dell touchscreen via USB.Weight is nice - but if you're used to a kindle, it's a shock, since the kindles are SO light.  But still not heavy enough to really be a problem usually.  The back is just brushed metal though so it's not very \"grippy\" (one of the things I liked the most from the original Kindle was the back, which helped it to be held without slipping).  I always have a snap on case of some sort that gives me a better handhold.I'm using the smart cover from my iPad 2 and it works fine on this new one.Sound is good for something with just the single speaker on it.  But sometimes your hand partially blocks it depending on how you're holding it.Sensitivity for game input (tilting, etc) is outstanding.Camera works great, better than the previous version, but it still will never replace a real digital camera. More for when something happens and you don't have the regular camera on hand.I'm very happy with mine.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Loving it", "Author": "Charlene", "ReviewID": "R2L6UNTPGPDO90", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I finally took the plunge and I replaced my laptop with an iPad.

We went out to a restaurant, they have never so quiet in a restaurant before. They actually shared and were able to play together. I have read some users have warned their screen heats up but I haven't noticed anything. I love that I can use it for work, my kids to play and that I can download books and movies.

There are very few improvements over the ipad 2. If you have never had an ipad, then go for the ipad 3. If you have an ipad 2 like I did, I would say stick with it and wait for the next year's ipad. Let me nonetheless talk about how I use this device.What do I use my iPad for -a) I stepped on my Kindle four months back and have been using my ipad for \"reading\" since. It is a much better experience because of the backlight, the smooth transitioning of fonts. It is so easy for me to send myself an ebook. I simply attach the .epub file to an email and send it to myself and it opens within seconds on iBook. On the other hand, if I have a .mobi file - I can simply open it using the Kindle app. If the Kindle app is installed on your ipad, when you click on the attached .mobi file in your email it simply opens it in Kindle.b) I sometimes like to watch mp4 files on my ipad. I do this when I'm lying on the bed leaning on a couple of cushions I can simply place the ipad on my stomach holding it with a hand and watch an episode of Game of Thrones. Bear in mind, it will not play any avi files or divx files and Apple iOS devices support only mp4. If you have a mac, I recommend a s/w called \"smartconverter\" which specifically converts avi files to mp4 for iPad 3.c) I'm using a Speck case so the fact that this little man heats up more than the predecessor hardly makes a difference. Does it heat up? yes, sometimes, it gets very annoying and does definitely heat up more than the ipad 2.d) Portable mp3. If you switch the screen on the ipad off and let it play music for you, it will keep playing at a sufficient volume for hours. I often go to sleep on my couch with the iPad singing away for hours. It can play audio for several hours without losing the battery.  I am disappointed in saying the audio is the exact same as it was on the ipad 2, so it not Louder than the ipad 2.e) Checking email, facebook, the web browsing still needs improvement because often times I have found Safari a bit lacking and buggy but trust me I am saying this from the point of view of someone who's been using the iPad for a year. If you have never used an iPad you will find it sufficient, I just find it annoying when I'm trying to use it on forums. The world wide web is still not very iPad friendly. Is it better to serve than any other tablet? Hell yes. But is it as good as using Firefox on my macbook air? Never. The keyboard is great.WHAT HAS CHANGED FROM THE IPAD 2 -a) A bit heavier but I got over that soon.b) The graphics are slightly better. The retina display is not that different. Brightness is the same.c) The 5 megapixel camera is very bad for indoor shooting. I havent traveled that much with my ipad so I can't say if the camera is all that good outdoors.d) This heats, that didnte) The battery is the same. I thought this will give me a much better battery because the battery is thicker, turns out, the battery is thicker to support the RETINA display.f) Faster graphical processor .. making it overall the fastest ipad.4G iPad - I feel all of this technology behind ipads supporting 4g is actually very misleading. In what you will really use your ipad for you will never need 4g. I urge you not to fall and become prey to ill effects of consumerism. I strongly advocate purchasing the wifi model. Even if you do get 4G and want to watch Netflix video, you get a limited data limit so why would you do that to your money?**Pulse application is good. Youtube looks the same but the newest OS has made it buggy and sometimes you have reload a video. Very amateur mistakes by Apple.I should have stuck with my ipad 2. This is really the iPad 2s. Facebook app is good. I wish Apple would charge us five bucks more and include one of those white headphones. Do buy a case if you're buying the new iPad because if you drop this it is more likely to crack the screen. Stay away from big cases, buy something practical, be a little careful and avoid those screen protectors. There is no excuse to making such a good looking device cheesy. Though it's a good reader, bear in mind, you will need to charge it daily. I turn it to aeroplane mood when Im reading but I'm not sure how much battery that saves.RETINA DISPLAY - If you put the ipad 2 and ipad 3 side by side you will notice the ipad 3 icons seems to be more clear and seem to take less space, seem more organized. It is a slight increase in the dots per inch. The hue on the buttons and icons for the ipad 2 is MISSING from the ipad 3. The new ipad does have a better display guaranteed. Here's a funny thing to consider. When I stopped looking at my ipad 2 and playing with it, I thought a month after using the ipad 3, the ipad 2 would look a little cheesy. The same way my ipod touch looked cheesy compared to the new ipod touch. THIS DID NOT HAPPEN. The ipad 2 still holds its own. All said and done, gotta love the iPad.Do I use a case? Yes. Speck.

Buy the 16 GB Model if any.", "Author": "Craig A Pridemore", "ReviewID": "R2UH6Z7UIKE7KV", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "From the time the iPad was first introduced, customers have been complaining about the \"Other\" category arbitrarily expanding to consume the available memory.  To date, Apple has never explained this problem or made any effort to fix it.  I have never been able to load more than half the iPad before the \"Other\" category suddenly appears and swallows most of the remaining memory.  I have the 64 GB iPod Touch and it easily loads all my stuff in under 50GB.  The iPad can't load half of it in \"64GB\".MANY customers have been complaining about this problem for YEARS and many have offered solutions on community forums, none of which work.  Apple remains silent.  It takes 10-20 hours to load the iPad depending on how many times you have to restart iTunes, which is frequently.  Since August 8th when I started counting (exactly two months now) I've tried to reload mine 33 times.  That's right:  33 times!  I tried many more times before I started counting.  I've gotten used to glitchy and unstable software from Apple, but Apple has been ignoring people's pleas for assistance with this problem for years now.  I'd hoped they'd make some effort with iOS 6, but NO help at all.  The 64GB iPad is a rip-off since half the memory is unusable.  I recommend not buying more than the 16GB version and just using it for basic games and simple email.If I only wanted 16GB, I'd say the iPad works fine.

So, like anyone else who had ordered the new iPad on the same day Apple announced it, I snatched my package up and ran into my room, closed the blinds, slit the package open, and turned the slate on. And the rest is history.Actually, most of that is a lie. I waited in shifts with my fianc\u00e9 to sign off on our packages, and then let the iPad sit in its shipping box for a few hours while I tried to sort out a racial conflict in Mass Effect 3. Anyhow, I did eventually open it, and now that I've spent nearly half a week using my iPad to do a variety of different tasks, I feel comfortable writing a brief little review of the device, to follow up my review of the Acer Iconia A500 tablet that I reviewed late last year.The first thing a user will notice when picking up the iPad is that it looks identical to the iPad 2. However, this third iteration is also slightly heavier, has a wider camera lens on the back, and, apparently, has slightly more tapered edges. I don't know about that, but to be totally frank, I couldn't have told the physical form factor apart from the iPad 2 if you'd held them in front of me. And that's OK with me, to be frank. The iPad, like all high-quality tablets, has a simple and understated look that stays out of the user's way. Like previous iterations, the 3rd generation iPad comes in two flavors (black and white), with a variety of storage (16, 32, 64 gigs) and connection arrangements (Wi-Fi and LTE (4g)). Whether you care to pay for the extra space or connectivity is a matter of personal preference, I opted for just the 16 gig Wi-Fi only model. So my review is based on that.Once you turn your new toy on, you'll notice the retina display. It's impossible not to. The screen on the iPad has effectively 4 times the number of pixels as previous generations, despite remaining the same size. Text on the screen is as crisp as print, and colors are more vibrant and defined. If you've spent any time with a laptop, desktop, tablet or Smartphone, you'll be able to see the difference immediately. It's gorgeous, and as near to life-like as we're like to get (for a few more years, anyway...). A lot of people are saying the retina screen is worth upgrading for alone. I don't know if that's totally true, but it is certainly a good argument.Despite the massive increase in pixel density, the iPad doesn't slow down at all. It packs an enhanced A5X processor chip inside, which runs a quad-core processor (basically as fast as most laptops and computers now, if not faster), and since it runs a smaller screen without all of the hardware attachments, the extra speed is put into driving the display with fluid speed. It's a lot of fun to just flip the pages back and forth. The quad-core processor also enables more advanced graphics for games; expect to see a few envelope-pushers coming out soon, like Epic/Chair's Infinity Blade: Dungeons here soon. With a quad-core, we might even see some more console games debut on the iPad, like GTA III did last year, to major success. The speed of the machine, plus the mobility, and the glorious retina display make for a beautiful, fun gaming experience. While there are very few retina-ready games out, most still up-scale well and look quite purdy. I use my iPad primarily for web-surfing and gaming, and I'm very glad I waited for the retina display.Oh, yeah. Web surfing. There's something so much more appealing about surfing the web on a tablet as compared to doing it on a laptop or other dedicated computing device. The tactile scrolling, the literal pointing and clicking, the meandering finger-tracing through websites and wiki-safaris--it makes for a great experience that leaves the user loathe to return to their old machines (I've taken to calling my laptop the \"diesel rig\"). While RSS-readers are available through most major browsers, the iPad (and other mobile devices) make a show of formatting a user's plethora of feeds and headlines into magazine forms. With my Acer tab, I used Google Reader to do just that, but on the iPad, there is a better alternative: FlipBoard. Most of my news, I read through FlipBoard, and on the retina display, the text is just as crisp, smooth, and black as it would be on a high-quality magazine print. Except that I can poke an image and start a high-resolution video, or ride a hyperlink out in half a second to the host site. It's a lot of fun to flip through my FlipBoard and read disparate articles from the wild range of feeds I subscribe to. I can sit there all day reading and flipping, poking and reading. The retina-ready FlipBoard app is the epitome of mobile media consumption: beautiful, simple, yours. That experience is worth buying the iPad for, let alone the bevy of excellent games, software, and the retina-display.I want to comment on battery life real quick: It's the same as the last iPad. Excellent. Ten hours with heavy usage, but I've gotten a lot more than that out of it already. I ran the thing down once after watching about three and a half hours of video, playing about four hours of games, surfing for five or six hours, and letting it standby for about twenty over two nights. It's a far cry better than the competition, but, here's a bit of a catch: it takes forever to charge. And the battery gets warm while you use it. This might lead to a heating problem in some models, so beware of that, but as far as I know, there haven't been any major complaints about the heating.There have been some complaints about the camera(s), though I don't know why. The camera is gorgeous, a five-megapixel beauty on the back and a decent one megapixel on the front. The two-way deal allows for backwards and forwards video calls, like the Acer tab did, which is a nice touch, especially with Apple's Facetime videoconferencing software. At the bottom, I've included a few sample shots I took with my iPad camera. It's a nice piece of hardware. Not the best, but by all means perfectly acceptable for shooting anything a normal human would be pointing a camera at. If you're a camera dork, the lack of a flash LED might be a turn-off, but deal with it. Light a match or something.I'm going to wrap this up here: if you have the money, indulge yourself. When I was a kid, my father had a big, cream-colored PC with a monitor that weighed as much as I do. When I was in high school, schools and houses started to convert to flat-screen LCDs, and cell phones became common-place. Now I have a computer that is very probably more powerful, with a display twice as clear, and many times more vibrant than the one you're reading on. It's an incredible leap in technology, and a beautiful one, too.

The weight and size was about the max that I thought I could withstand in a handheld device.  For me, the iPad 3 is a set of compromises that I decided was worth it in the end.Weight/thickness: If you hold your iPad a lot when using it, then I think you will notice the extra heft of the third gen iPad.  It's not major, but it's noticeable. I find that I become a fatigued more quickly when reading in bed or holding the iPad on the plan while watching a movie, etc.Heat:  Yes, it runs a lot warmer than my iPad 2.  You will notice it.  The heat adds to the overall fatigue, largely because the greatest heat occurs exactly where you hold the iPad in portrait mode (lower left corner). Sure would have been nice if they cold have flipped something around inside to put the greatest heat elsewhere.Screen:  Nice improvement over the iPad2.  Makes reading easier on the eyes.  No more jagged fonts. When I go back to reading on my iPad 2, I wonder how in the word I managed with it.  Colors are more vibrant too.  I won't call is revolutionary, but it is a very nice upgrade.  At the end of the day, my iPad 2 would still be fine if I had never seen the iPad 3 screen.LTE:  This is a major selling point for me.  AT&T; LTE has been faster than both my home and work WiFi.  I did notice that LTE drains the battery very quickly, however.  I saw a 10% drop in battery within about 15 minutes while using LTE.  Battery drain was much slower when I jumped onto my work wifi.Overall:  I am happy with the new iPad, but I do find that I miss the smaller size and weight of the iPad 2.  The iPad 2 \"disappears\" when you use it, which was Steve Job's main objectives.  The iPad 3 does not have the same effect.  The screen pulls you in, but the extra heft becomes apparent more quickly.  IF the heft doesn't become noticeable, the heat will get your attention.  The heat is within acceptable limits, but it is there to remind you that you are holding an electronic device.  It's harder to get lost in that book or movie.  So if the magic of the iPad disappearing is important to you, then wait for the fourth gen which is bound to be lighter and cooler.  If you want a graphics and LTE workhorse that you will use on a table more than holding free-form in your hand, then the iPad 3 is a good choice.  Overall, I prefer the iPad 2 for the reason that it does disappear and pull you in.

It's excellent for photographers or those who prefer quality text. In my case, I love it to view photographs and to read books, and magazines. New Yorker and National Geographic look great on it!+ It's intuitive to use, and this makes it an amazing device to use- sorry for Apple marketing speak, but it's true. You'll never look at a laptop in the same way again. The quick power on and the built-in gestures makes it easy to move between apps, search, etc.+ Apple has always had great cameras in their phones and this one is no exection. The camera is great, and although a lot of reviewers make fun of it, or think it is superflous, they are wrong. The big screen makes it fun to take pictures or videos as I recently did at the National Air and Space Museum.+ The moveable & splittable on-screen keyboard makes it useable, but just for simple stuff, see below for more intensive writing.+ The size is perfect for me. i can see some wanting a 7\" screen but I enjoy the space.+ Battery life is excellent!- If I had my choice, I'd have it weigh a few ounces less. If you hold it for long periods, it can be tiring, just like a heavy book.- The screen is too reflective. If you're using it at an angle you often can see the ceiling lights reflected it in it.- The front facing camera has limited resolution, which is limited when making facetime calls to relatives that you haven't seen in a while. It's okay, but not up to the screen's quality.If you really want to write something long like a short story, long email, or leave your laptop at home, get Apple's Pages (similar to MS Word with spreadsheet and presentation versions available) app, and a bluetooth keyboard. Some people recommend iPad cases with a built-in keyboard but the two I have tried have been too bulky reducing the fun of using it. These all in one keyboards are too small causing the keys to be unreliable for typing. Instead get a light bluetooth keyboard that you can use while propped up in bed or on a desk. Apple's keyboard that I got my wife works well but its on/off is clugey and it's too big & heavy. A better alternative is Amazon's Basics bluetooth keyboard for the iPhone and iPad. It works well and is very light, which is great while traveling.I haven't found a case I am crazy about. The challenge is that the case needs to provide protection without interfering with its operation- holding it, taking photos, etc. Make sure you get one with an adjustable angle so that you can use it in bed or on a desk. The Apple flip is nice but I feel it doesn't provide enough protection.Take care.Update 12-09-06: I've gotten Apple's latest case- iPad Smart Case, which is almost perfect, providing good protection. I would prefer if it's stand worked in vertical mode.This is an amazing device.

Please check Apple's prices, which include free shipping (but tax is extra) against prices offered on Amazon before making your buying decision.  Usually Amazon has the most competitive pricing around, but for some reason they (or their vendors) are charging higher than \"list price\" for the various \"new\" iPads. WIth iPods, in contrast, they charge significantly lower prices. _Also be aware that Amazon Market vendor return policies are set by vendors INDIVIDUALLY not by Amazon._ Amazon generally has the most liberal return policies in the industry except for Costco, while individual retailers are generally much more strict.Here is my usage history with iDevices:I fell in love with the iPod Touch, 3rd generation, in 2009 when I bought it to see if it could really replace a netbook on my trips. I was dubious that a 3.5\" screen would \"work\" but the emergence of mobile-optimized websites coupled with \"double tap to perfectly zoom to full column size\" feature made it workable for reading the NY TImes and practically everything else. I read several novels on this during my trips, even though the 3rd gen did NOT have the current high resolution Retina feature.When the \"Retina Display\" 4th generation iPod Touch came out in 2010, it was a revelation in terms of reduced eyestrain. With my contact lenses out, or with high diopter (2.75) reading glasses, I could read comfortably for hours, and the built-in illumination was wonderful, no need for a miners headlamp when going to bed, no screen glare.I wasn't sure about the iPad when it came out, and skipped the first generation. I personally even skipped the second generation (iPad2) but bought one for my wife. She has a specific, limited consumption need - she watches foreign language videos on YouTube and on a foreign language subscription website. For those two purposes, the iPad2 screen was superb, and like the iPhone and iPod Touches it has a wide viewing angle, IPS screen - compared to my laptops and netbooks, viewing angles were a breeze. With my laptops and netbooks, I couldn't shift my head up or down, I had to find the perfect \"tilt\" angle so the bottom and top of the screen were evenly bright and not washed out or black. With i-devices,  viewing angles are superb, colors are great - and this is true for all of them to date (with the latest \"new\" iPad being rated by one monitor-specific site as approaching professional quality for accuracy of colors and illumination levels). My wife could watch her iPad2 from almost any angle.But guess what? I was expecting to start to glom onto her iPad2 until it would be like a fight over the tv remote, but that never happened. I watched large video on my desktop, I read blogs and news and books on my iPod Touch! When I tried reading on the iPad2, I found the resolution was too low - it was like sliding back to a 3rd generation iPod Touch in terms of quality. Not easy on the eyes. Good compared to a netbook screen, but not as good as a Kindle e-reader (not the Fire) or as good as a 4th gen iPod Touch.When the \"new\" iPad came out, I knew it would be game-changing, with a ultra sharp \"type.\" Now that I've had it for several months, I believe it is. But is it essential?I have been switching back and forth between my \"new\" iPad and my wife's iPad2 over the past few months, and undoubtedly the new iPad is a MUCH more pleasant \"reading\" experience. THIS is the best e-reader on the market - do the math - it is in COLOR so highlight colors, chapter headings, book covers, illustrations, all POP, while the text is as easy to read as on an e-ink reader, PLUS illumination is BUILT-IN. THIS is the wave of e-readers of the future.Reading email and Facebook is easier too.All icons are sharper.VIDEO IS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER. Remember, the iPad2 could already display 720p. Bumping up to 1080p on the new iPad doesn't provide significantly better video. GAMING IS BETTER because the smarter game programmers are using the extra video horsepower for better action and shading NOT for higher resolution per se. The new video chip in the new iPad is simply head and shoulders better than in the prior iPad2 even if the actual processor is the same speed (the cpu vs. the gpu).So why do I find my self using my iPod Touch and desktop MUCH more than the new iPad or the iPad2?Simply, size. 10.1\" is a little heavy to hold. When I am reading a book where the book design is important, the new iPad is terrific. But that is rare. Most of my reading is \"just text\" and the 3.5\" screen of the iPod Touch is more than adequate for that - long ago I got used to frequent page flipping, it doesn't bother me anymore.So what is my shopping recommendation?If you aren't satisfied with your \"smartphone\" (it's too small, but that is in the process of changing, already in the Android market and soon in the iPhone world) you may well be happy with an iPad. If you are mainly watching video, the iPad2, still in production, has much better battery life (they just improved the battery life by moving to a smaller \"die size\" for the processor/gpu - check Anandtech for the details) and fine video. If you mainly read email, blogs, and browse the web, and ESPECIALLY if you plan on reading a lot of books, don't think twice, buy the new iPad.But be forewarned that rumors are flying that Apple is releasing a 7.85\" tablet soon, probably with the same resolution as the iPad2 (which means sharper letters since the screen is smaller), and that may be the \"sweet spot\" in terms of size that a lot of us have been waiting for. Also, rumors are flying that Apple intends to \"upsize\" the iPod Touch and also the iPhone to a 3.95\"/4.01' screen, which will make it easier to read while still being light and comfortable in the hand.Finally, Apple devices have done remarkably well at holding their value, and Amazon has an excellent re-purchase program for small electronics, and pays some of the industries highest prices for used i-devices. There probably isn't a more significant \"game changing\" electronic gizmo in the last decade than the iPhone and iPad. You won't go wrong or regret an iPad purchase, and except for slightly shorter battery life there is no _negative_ to purchasing the latest and greatest - the price didn't even go up this round (although the iPad2 in 16gb only was retained).16gb is enough for photos and books. 32gb or larger is recommended if you intend to load up a lot of games, download movies or a lot of music, or take a lot of videos.", "Date": "May 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "A very good purchase", "Author": "Ah Pui", "ReviewID": "R3R2O5CP6OICN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "as a first time tablet user, I am simply blown away by the new stunning ipad. The screen is simply gorgeous and the clarity and crispness of the text is literally like reading a paper in hand. Can't really describe it as you have to see it to believe it. I feel like I can touch the text itself instead of reading them through a screen. If you use ipad as a book reader, I highly recommend you to get it. The text quality do improve a whole lot. But I think regular gallery pictures and videos will look the same in your regular non-retina devices.I couldn't seem to find too many retina-ipad3 specific apps out there in the wild that I am interested in. I am not a big gamer so I will have to wait to see how other productivity apps will look in this stunning new screen. Flipboard and Pulse do look absolutely amazing and the browsing experience is even more elevated here.After lots of research, I believe the only sure smartcover for ipad that is guaranteed to work is the Apple Smartcover. So I purchased one with it and so far happy with my decision. I did get some minor scratches on the back already so I am rushing to get a Smartcover partner to protect the backcase. I am the kind of guy who aren't usually careful with gadgets but this ipad just have the magic draw to get pamper.Can't comment too much on the battery life, but it still hasn't drained out after days of playing. So it looks good! Wish there is a wireless wifi charger for this baby like the rumored Samsung S3 has. then it would be perfect! Since ipad does not have any usb ports, it comes along with a wall charger. But I didn't find it as a hindrance at all given its long battery life. My overall interaction with my new ipad is an absolute joy as everything is so easy to use and very intuitive. Kudos to Apple for making such a gorgeous, simple and clean, and absolutely intuitive product.Before settling on the new ipad, I have been debating whether to go for android tablet or not. I am a very happy android smartphone user so is not allergic to the android ecosystem. But the android tablet world is a different beast. Most of the android apps seem to tailor more to the smartphone so won't look as good on the tablet. Hard to find Android 4.0 Ice-cream sandwich even on the latest android tablets so the current bunch look dated. Granted there are a lot more hardware options to choose from and specs maybe more powerful, but none match the quality, ease of use and overall look and feel of ipad. The other factor that seal the deal for me is that the resale value of ipad is so overwhelming strong that I can safely buy it now and upgrade it later in the future, knowing that my current device will still fetch a pretty penny.For would be first-time tablet/ipad users, I highly recommend going for it. It is going to be a wonderful experience that you have to own it to believe it. Given the high resale value of the currently existing ipad2 and how the new ipad costs pretty much the same as before, upgrading it is not a bad idea at all. For those people on the fence about getting an ipad or android tablets either existing, or the upcoming Samsung Note or tab tablet, or even the highly anticipated Asus transformer infinity, you own it to yourself to give the new ipad a try.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "3 Generations in and Still No Equal", "Author": "Vincent E.

The tablet has become and extension of my arm!My Apple iPad.  What started out as a nice to have toy, has become the virtually indispensable tool for making sense of my increasingly hectic life.  There isn't a day that goes by when I am not on the device; from checking my e-mail, to sending and receiving text messages; from checking my calendar to playing games with friends and family; from posting to Facebook or Twitter to listening to NPR's morning edition; reading the latest news from the AP, New York Times, Politico, NPR, or The Daily, to listening to music on-line or stored on my hard drive; from logging into my business network via VPN, to talking to me daughter via FaceTime, almost everything I need to get done on my laptop I can now do on my iPad.Now Apple has released the iPad 3 and those of us who use the iPad 2 are throwing them over for the next big, or should I say smaller thing.  I was satisfied with the iPad 2, but never wanting to be behind the technology curve I decided to order the newest offering from Apple in the exact same configuration as the last; in other words I ordered an \"iPad 64GB Wi-Fi+4G\" version.The iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G FactsOn the surface the iPad 3 is not demonstratively different from the iPad 2.  Featuring an Apple designed Dual-core A5X, low power, high performance processor, the 1.44 pound (1.46 pounds for the Wi-Fi + 4G) iPad 3 is a tad thinner than the iPad 2, though the screen size stays the same.  Other than that, there are no physical changes to the tablet.  Under the skin however, Apple has included a Retina display that offers 2048 x 1536 pixel resolution @ 264 pixels per inch.  The other notable change concerns the front and rear facing cameras, which now offer 5MP autofocus resolution and HD video recording.No matter what hardware version (Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi + 4G, 16GB, 32GB, or 64GB) you chose the Ultra-Portable, iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G is a simple device with very few moving parts.  The power button sits on the top of the device on the right, while a standard 3.5mm headphone jack is situated on the far left.  Along the right edge of the 0.37\" thick iPad you'll find the screen lock/mute and volume control switches, while the bottom of the 9.56\" long device is reserved for speakers and the USB/power port.  The USB port is proprietary so, no, like the iPad Original you cannot plug a USB memory stick into it, but with the provided cord you can plug it into your computer and into an outlet to recharge the device.The iPad 3 (available in black and white body styles) can be had with 16GB, 32GB, or 64GB of memory, and all iterations are fitted with a 1GHz Apple A5 custom-designed, high performance, low-power processor.  Internet connectivity is through either Wi-Fi (802.11a/b/g/n), and or 4G LTE: UMTS/HSDPA/HSPA+/DC -HSDPA (850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz) and GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz).  Bluetooth 2.1 EDR is also provided with either configuration.The 9.7-inch fingerprint resistant LED-backlit glossy widescreen multi-touch color display offers 2048 x 1536 pixel resolution @ 264 pixels per inch and can display multiple languages and characters simultaneously.  The IPad 3 is fitted with an ambient light sensor and the device supports 576p and 480p with Apple Component AV Cable; 576i and 480i with Apple Composite AV Cable and 1024x 768 with Dock Connector to VGA adapter.The back camera can be used for HD (1080p) video recording of up to 30 frames per second with audio, as well as still camera with 5x zoom.  The front camera can also be used for (VGA) video recording of up to 30 frames per second with audio, as well as still camera pictures.Re-syncing with iTunes or iCloudThe iPad 3 will sync up whatever Apps, music, Podcasts, movies, etc., connected/ associated with your iTunes account and currently on your iTunes desktop.  I was able to sync the iPad 3 to iTunes and like magic everything that was on my iPad 2 showed up on my iPad 3, since the last time I \"physically\" backed up the tablet via iTunes, right before I started using iCloud to perform back-ups.So I finished the restore via iCloud which took close to three hours to complete.  No big deal; I plugged the tablet into A/C, started the restore and went to bed. I did restore all of my music (15GB) via iTunes however, and that took considerably longer than 3 hours to accomplish; again another overnight chore.  I suppose if I purchase more iCloud storage I could back up everything including my music, but I see no need to pay for additional storage; 10GB would set me back $20.00 a year; 20GB = $40.00/year, and; 50GB = $100.00/year.Microsoft ActiveSyncSurprisingly, or maybe not so surprisingly, setting up the iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G to use Microsoft Exchange via Exchange ActiveSync is simple and easy; all told it took less the two minute to start receiving my business e-mail on the device, and there does not seem to be a limit to the number of devices associated with a given ActiveSync account; I also have my iPhone 4S and iPod 3rd Generation synced.After I established the connection via ActiveSync I verified inbox functionality by reading, responding to, forwarding, and moving, e-mail.  iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G even allows you to choose whether or not you want to download your business contacts and calendar; sweet!And once connected I am able to control password usage, minimum and maximum length, age, complexity, and expiration via an Exchange ActiveSync policy.  The policy can also control other aspect of the iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G's including third-party e-mail account creation; Windows SharePoint Services and Windows File Shares access; message size limits; attachment downloading, as well as a host of other security related features and functions.Word to the wise: Exchange ActiveSync policies, limited as they can be configured to disable a number of features on the device including camera, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi.  And yes, utilizing ActiveSync I can even wipe the iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G from the Exchange server, and as long as the tablet remains a part of the ActiveSync policy it will continue to wipe every time its powered on unless it is either removed from the policy or the check mark is removed from the radio button instructing ActiveSync to \"Perform a remote wipe to clear mobile device data.\"VPN AccessThe iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G has VPN access and it actually work quite well.  There are three options: L2TP, PPTP, or Cisco IPSEC. Like Exchange ActiveSync the VPN functionality was surprisingly easy to set up and get going, all one needs to know is what information to plug in and away we go!VPN took less than a minute to set up and configure, and once complete I was able to log into my company Intranet and thanks to some (free) Apps I was able to RDP into my workstation from the iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G; again, sweet!  Yes, the lack of makes maneuvering around the desktop somewhat challenging, but I could still get around the desktop and use it.  Note: there are paid versions of the Apps I used that offer crude mouse functionality.Like all of the network components on iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G VPN can be togged on and off at will.Personal HotspotNew to the iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G is the Personal Hotspot, which allows you to share the tablets' cellular data connection in order to connect computers and other devices to the Internet.  Nice!!!First ImpressionsLike the iPad's that have come before it, I really, really, really, like the Apple iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G.  Naysayers aside this thing is cool and I am happy to own one and even take it out in public!  I love being able to take my favorite book(s) with me when I am on the go, and I have the ability to stop at a Wi-Fi hotspot and plugging into the Internet in order to read the latest news, get the weather, run an application, play a game, post to social networks, log into my business network and access my workstation, read e-mail, etc.But, I really like the fact that I can take the lightweight iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G with me everywhere and still gain access to my pre-selected books, magazines, music and images, not to mention a seemingly endless supply of useful applications.  And let's not forget the Internet and business as well as personal e-mail.Today while typing out this review on my iMac, I fired up my iPad 3 and I played Hanging with Friends with an old friend in Maryland, held a text conversation with a friend visiting Vegas and another in downstate Illinois, read e-mails from 3 separate accounts, posted to Facebook & Twitter, while listening to music via Pandora! Last night while grilling BBQ chicken on the patio I streamed music from my iPad to a portable Bose speaker via Bluetooth!Setting up Wi-Fi is easy enough; the antenna is always on and looking for new connection.  I set up the iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G to use the secure wireless setup at work; I typed in the pass-phrase via the incredibly handy keyboard and surfed the Internet; simple and easy.  Since I started using the iPad I have taken it out frequently to places that offer free Wi-Fi access and in only one instance did I have an issue connecting.  Nice!  And even then I effortlessly switched to 4G and, instance access.Heat & NoiseThere has been much to do about the heat the iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G gives off, and while I have noted that the tablet gets a little warmer than its predecessor, the degree of change is in no way uncomfortable.  So, I have to ask what all the fuss is about!?ConclusionsI like the iPad; it is the must have device of the decade, period for anyone who wants to stay connected!  Not a day goes by when I do not use it for something.  I love the portability of the device, the ease of use, the utilitarian nature of the unit, thanks in large part to the plethora of Apps that can be down loaded and utilized for the tablet.Is the iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G ready for the enterprise?  I say yes with a few caveats; chief among them is the inability of the tablet to truly manipulate Microsoft Office Applications without the assistance of the Documents-to-Go application ($9.99), or an increasing number of similar applications.  Second is the inability to truly mirror the iPad screen on a monitor, however with the Apple Digital AV Adapter that can be changed.  Video can be presented onto the screen--via an HDMI connection.Lastly, is the lack of available USB port(s) or a memory card reader that will accept memory devices and help you keep files organized on-the-go, as well as the ability to truly turn the iPad into a mobile office, though again via Apps that is changing.  For instance I purchased an App last week that allows me to access our Microsoft SharePoint 2007 environment and manipulate documents contained in Lists and Document Libraries.  This is a big deal as more and more business content is shared and or stored on SharePoint in a number of businesses.  The availability of VPN on the iPad makes this possible.There are also a number of very good RDP applications available in the App Store that will allow me to log into my workstation at the office and manipulate date via VPN. As the number of Apps that mimic , and or reproduce the business environment increase so too with the iPad's usefulness as a business tool!Hands down, the Apple iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G is a performance winner, and one heck of an e-book reader! The new Retina display has made considerable difference in the reading of text on the tablet.  Whereas before my eyes would start to hurt after just 15 minutes of book reading on the older iPads, not I can read continually without discomfort, the text acuity has improved that much!Yes, the entrance fee ($829.00 for iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G) is steep, and enterprise customers will have to think long and hard at the cost, however the iPad now has a certain \"cool\" factor that is hard to escape.  The more large enterprises adapt the iPad and find practical uses for it, the more popular it will become in the hall of corporate America.So far the iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G has more than lived up to my expectations and I have fun testing the limits of its ability to operate effectively in the enterprise and personal environments.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great display for text and graphics", "Author": "Stan Gibilisco", "ReviewID": "R2EXRAYX55HXHJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this device mainly because of its high-resolution display (2048 x 1536 pixels). To me, clear text and graphics matter more than anything else. I need a device that can do simple Web browsing on Wi-Fi, but I don't need the high-powered features such as 4G LTE or great video (yet). The display lives up to my best expectations. I've never seen anything else like it. It's as clear as the finest printed book pages ever were.I'm conducting experiments in \"dynamic book publishing\" right now, and I want readers to see the text and simple graphics (grayscale technical drawings) clearly. This device is perfect for that application, although at times I feel like I'm driving a Lamborghini at 20 miles an hour because I have not come close to utilizing all the capabilities of the device. The new iPad can play movies just like a TV set, and I'm looking at plain text and line drawings. But oh, what crisp letters and numbers and equations and pictures they are!I've read some complaints in the blogosphere about poor Wi-Fi sensitivity and slow, hot battery charging in the new iPad. I have a Nook Tablet and Kindle Fire, and the new iPad works better on Wi-Fi than either of those devices. I took the iPad to several local establishments and tested it on Wi-Fi, and never got any result other than all three bars lit (strong signal). The new iPad also has better range with my router than an old laptop computer with a PC card wireless modem has. It does take awhile to change the battery, about 6 hours from minimum to a full charge, but I expected this result because the new iPad's battery has greater capacity than the one in previous versions. (It takes longer to fill up a big \"electricity tank\" than it takes to fill a smaller one at the same power level.) I didn't notice excessive heat during the charging process, as some people have complained about.I've heard one limitation that I take quite seriously: Don't drop this thing from shoulder height and expect it to work afterwards. The display will likely shatter.For my purposes, an iPad 2 would have done well enough. But I wanted something that would do better than well enough, and this thing does. It's my first Apple since I had an old \"II Plus\" back in 1982.

I have both versions, receiving my iPad 3 via FedEx this morning. So I've had a little time to compare them side by side instead of reading all the great things the iPad 3 can do online etc.The first thing I noticed when I opened the box was that the packaging was no different than the iPad 2. The only difference being that it states 32GB 4G on the new iPad (3) instead of 32GB 3G on the iPad 2. Set up was very simple. There was no need for me to connect it to iTunes which I dreaded. It came 80% charged and all the steps needed to connect and set up your new iPad is actually done on the iPad without you needing to connect it to iTunes.Edit: Just realized that this means that for those who have a windows based PC and don't want to install iTunes, all you need is an apple ID. In order to get one you can go to appleid.apple.com. Once you have that you can purchase all you need from iTunes without the use of a computer. Great for those who also don't own a computer although in this day almost everyone has one. :)The clarity of the new iPad is a lot clearer compared to the iPad 2, (I've uploaded a pic but you may not notice it since it still has the plastic on that it came with). It's also a little heavier than the iPad 2. I did notice though that my ATT signal is a lot stronger on the 3G version compared to the new iPad. I have a lot more bars. If that's going to be a problem then I'd suggest getting the iPad 2 unless you're just going to be using the WiFi option.Here's my pros of the new iPad. The 5mp rear facing camera compared to barely existent one on the iPad 2. Sure you're still not going to get pictures you can send in to National Geographic but it's a lot better than before. If you want it to just use as a camera you're still going to be disappointed. The retina display makes your screen pop and sure makes it look a lot more vibrant.

The Kindle app on iPad is wonderful--every book has its right cover, etc.  I purchased the 64 gb version and I am so glad I did.  iPad apps are much larger to take advantage of the retina screen.Some people have mentioned that the tablet gets warm or hot--I have found after a full day of intensive use that the tablet got no warmer than any android tablet I have ever used.  I have used the tablet outside to read and play games and as long as the sun is not directly on the screen I was able to see it very well and I had the screen brightness just past the 50% marker.

Miyao", "ReviewID": "R2LW0OP2OHU9GE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I picked up my iPad this morning from the Apple store here in San Diego and have played with it all day.  I got the white 32gb 4g Verizon version.  I bought the Verizon version because you can still use it all over the world as it does have GSM built into it unlike the iPad2 Verizon version, and in San Diego the Verizon LTE is at minimum 4 times faster than AT&T; faux G and the mobile hot spot feature is included in Verizon's data plan whereas AT&T; it is not.  I am a AT&T; customer otherwise and I really like them as a cell provider(I know I may be in the minority on this one).A little background on me - I love gadgets.  I love to get them as soon as they come out but I try to be as unbiased as possible.  I have owned a few tablets, all of the iPads now, the Kindle Fire, the Motorola Zoom and a couple of other droid tablets not worth mentioning.  I have owned all of the iPhones, the Motorola Atrix, Dell Streak 5, Samsung Focus when windows mobile 7 was launched, and a couple of other droid devices, again not worth mentioning.  I use Windows 7 at work, but am all OSX at home.  I have the Macbook Air(2011 version) and the Mac Mini (2011 version).Just a quick recommendation if you don't want to read a long review.  Yes the screen is that much better.  No, the iPad3 is not that much faster than the iPad2.  It feels slightly heavier and thicker, but if you use a case, which I'm sure a lot of you do, it doesn't matter.  If you have the iPad 2, it probably won't be worth the upgrade unless doubling your resolution is important to you.  As of right now, only 42 apps are optimized for the high resolution screen.  The Amazon Kindle App does look spectacular, but it is still a backlit screen which will cause eye fatigue/strain for some people.  I would recommend the iPad 3 if you are upgrading from the first version, if this is your first tablet, and if you don't like droid tablets.It goes without saying that Apple products are really easy to use.  I have seen 3 year olds use the iPad with more ease than talking and I have parents who are technologically backwards but still manage to navigate their iPhones and iPads very easily.  In general most people like this about their mobile devices, although some people want the ability to hack their phones/tablets to get more out of their device(droid products).  I see the benefit to both, but I am a fan of the easier of the two.  I still think Apple has a significant advantage over the competition when it comes to software.  If you want simple, with access to thousands of apps stick with this device.I know that the iPad is not the cheapest device, but in general I believe you get what you pay for.  The Kindle Fire is cheap and is accessible to way more people simply due to the fact that it is only 199 whereas the base model of the iPads is 499.  If the Kindle Fire is your first tablet and you have never owned any other tablets it is a great starter.  But once you have used the iPad, you will get used to the larger display, clearer resolution, smoother rendering of videos, and no lag in between tasks.  I have found that all droid products have a lag to them that I never notice with Apple mobile devices.  I even find windows mobile 7 to outperform droid.  I showed the iPad off to a few co-workers today and they loved the new Retina display.  They were amazed at how clear it was and a couple of them even went on to order their own.  It really is the biggest improvement. If you have an iPad 2, it may not be a significant enough upgrade to justify the cost, especially since the resale price of your used iPad 2 has significantly dropped with the price drop on the iPad 2 still being sold by Apple.  I do have a friend who is a graphic designer, and once she saw the iPad3 vs the iPad2, she ordered herself the new model because she couldn't go back.The Verizon 4g is really fast.  I ran a speediest today and was getting 6-10mb/s download and 2mb/s upload in my area of San Diego.  This is way faster than any current device I own that connects to a mobile network.  My iPhone 4s on AT&T; averages 1mb/s down and 1mb/s up in the same testing spot.  I really like that the mobile hotspot feature is built into the data plan whereas with AT&T; it is allowed(I'm guessing this will change though for them to stay competitive with the competition).I do love the iPad3 for my own use.  I don't think I can go back to using my iPad 2 so my nieces will probably get my hand me down.  I am a early adopter and have been told many times that I waste my money on these expensive Apple products.  I have have been called a Apple fan boy, but I personally have tried all three major platforms so I think my review is maybe a little more unbiased than some of the other 5 star reviews.  Sorry RIM, I think you are on the verge of death.  I know there will always be Apple haters, and by all means everyone should have their own opinions.  But for me, I personally recommend Apple mobile devices to everyone I know and even those same people who said,\" you waste your money, I will never need an iPhone\", are now current iPad users and iPhone users and the speak as if they were the first ones to discover the iPhone.  The lines speak for the products.  They get longer and longer every year and the products keep improving.  Many reviewers complain that the upgrades to each iteration of the iPad/iPhone isn't significant, but that is usually said even before the product is released to the general public and within 2 months everyone forgets about the previous generation.If you are on the fence, you can feel comfortable trying the iPad by purchasing it because if you don't like it, I can almost guarantee right now that you will get your money back if you were to sell it via Amazon, Craigslist, or eBay.  If not, I'm sure you know someone who will take it off your hands for free.  It is very typical of gadgets to have a really bad resale value even if you have only used the product for 1 month.  But because Apple only has one generation per year, and never discounts their products, they tend to hold resale value better than the competition.I hope my review helped you come to a decision and if you get the iPad3, I hope you love it as much as I do.  Oh yeah, I also use my iPad a lot for my work.  I am a chemist and there are a lot of useful apps for me.Edit - 3/18/2012I did get an iPad that has a slight yellow tint.  I have seen this issues a few times with the white iPhone and Apple will exchange your iPad in the store for this defect.

The file setup for the Ipad is rudimentary.  For example, the Kindle has a much better interface, allowing you to transfer documents and organize them easily.  Many of us are document intensive, wanting to read word files, pdf files, essays, briefs, and other documents.  This is difficult using an Ipad.  The screen, slow motion, and trendy apps on the Ipad are really great.  The engineering is superb.  But Apple still does not know how to appeal to the document intensive professional who mainly wants to review documents, read large word files, and share material between PCs, Word, and the Ipad.  File sharing is possible using the Ipad, but it is difficult, and you are in for some real learning time, trial and error, downloading various apps, signing up for Icloud and Itunes, figuring out how to interface, transfer, etc.  Instead of making this easy and intuitive, Apple has made this difficult.  It is as if Apple hates any other supplier, and does not encourage you to use any other devices except Apple devices and software.

While it does get finger prints it does not get them that bad. Battery lasts a long time for a tablet, Fast A5X processor, great apps at decent prices and most apps have free version to try. The white version looks elegant and professional. Facetime is awesome. It also comes with a free 5GB icloud service for back up. The  WiFi reception is very good.  The speakers produce great sound and the games look awesome! There is so much to list! It is slightly little heavier than the Ipad 2 makes it feels more durable. iOS 6 coming soon!Cons: Does get kind of warm compared to Ipad 2, location of the volume rocker, didn't come with any accessories, something simple as some headphones would have been nice or a cleaning cloth for the screen. ITunes can be more expensive than songs you can purchase from Amazon (Sometimes a dollar more for an entire album).This is my first Ipad. My wife had an Ipad 2 from work so I had something to compare it to. I have been an avid android user for years. The most recent tablet that I own was the Acer 100 Iconia. It was a great tablet for the price. My wife really wants me to go Apple so we can do more things together for fun or facetime when she goes out of town. Ipad 3 simply works. It is a beautiful machine and If I was not a gamer, I would have sold my PC and try out their computers as well. I am one of those people who always gave Apple a hard time (though they are overpriced still). I have the WiFi non 4g version. I tether it to my Android phone on a 3G network (LOL) and still able to browse the web, listen to music and play at a decent speed. The color on the screen just pops. Everything is so crisp and clear. Not only do games and other apps look great but reading anything like Flipboard or books are fantastic. The words are so easy to read on the eyes and are very sharp. There is so much to do. Rent movies; buy music, apps that help to bring the creativity out of you. There are plenty of accessories that you can purchase for your Ipad. It did annoy me that for the price you paid for this great tablet that it didn't come with anything but a couple of Apple stickers.  I was expecting at least a pair of headphone to use while lying in bed watching a movie or listening to music while my wife sleeps. The appstore is great. The one improvement on the appstore would be that when you download an app that it would be nice if the appstore would stay open instead of going back to the screen to show you the download. At the moment FaceTime can only be used on WiFi but with the iOS 6 you will be able to use it over a 4G network. I opted not to get the 4G version because I do not think it is worth paying $200 more to get the feature. Especially with the new Iphone 5 that will come out on the 4G network you can just use the tethering option and save some money over all though you will have to pay for the service. Though I have had only three days with this Ipad, I can't seem to put it down. I even take it to work and never brought my android. The ipad simply works. I was into rooting my phones and tablets, changing my ROMs out on a regular basis and have gotten to a point that I do not care about doing that kind of stuff anymore. I love simply just turning my ipad on and enjoy my experience. If  you are looking for a great tablet and can save for it. This is the one to get.

The screen resolution is beautiful, it interacts beautifully with my AppleTV, and I was able to find enough productivity/business apps that it's not just an $800 gaming platform. I even bought a good dashboard mount ( here on Amazon - search for Kropsson 900 - so its great for navigation on long car trips (you *must* have the 4G though - I started out with a Wi-Fi and a Verizon hotspot, but your location isn't tracked real-time on Wi-Fi, so it was useless for that particular application).However. I'm finding that the battery life leaves a lot to be desired. I actually took the first one back because I thought there was something wrong with it. Not so much - it simply drains very quickly. Just since I started writing this review, it has dropped by 2%. Oh - there's another 1%. It doesn't charge when it's plugged into your computer (not sure if that's specific to this one), and even the charger itself makes a difference. I've got a number of cables in various places around the house that I use to charge (kitchen for when I'm cooking, living room for when I'm reading, bedside for overnight charge, etc.) and I've found that the older cables charge so slowly that they're essentially useless. The dashboard mount has a place that you can plug a charger into to help with cord management, but going through that, the battery usage when using the navigation app (Waze - highly recommended) out-paced the charging ability of the mount. When my iPad was plugged directly into the cigarette lighter, there was no change - battery didn't go down, but it didn't charge either. I couldn't play music at the same time, or it couldn't keep up then either.Somebody else mentioned that the back of the iPad gets hot. I also found this to be true. The Apple store explained that it's because the battery is larger - obviously that's necessary because it sucks up so much juice. It's now gone down another 5% since my last mention.Bottom line, I still love the thing. It's damn cool. There's a lot you can do with it. But keep a charger handy.

Partridge", "ReviewID": "RUAHDQH0PLB6X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is, without a doubt, the best tablet on the market. It's what's all other tablets aspire to be, hands down. The problem is that while it's better than the iPad 2, the difference might not be enough.So what's different?  The screen is now 4 times the resolution.  It's the best screen on a tablet, by miles. If you were to display a picture of icecream on the screen you'd be tempted to even lick it. RAM is also now doubled which leads, most notably so far, to less reloading of pages when you use multiple tabs in browsing.  The graphics processor is also better, while the main processor it self remains at the same speeds.  The differences in this, so far, aren't perceivable.  The back camera is also improved but I'm not really sure who's taking pictures with their iPad.  If you go with the LTE option, well that's going to clean the floor with the 3G versions, but that's up to you. On the downside the tablet is now also a little heavier (it is noticeable, but you'll forget about it) and runs warmer with long use (this is also noticeable and you won't be able to ignore it unless you're using a case).  Also Apple changed the polarity of the sleep/wake magnets so now nearly all 3rd party cases that you have from the iPad 2 won't work that way.What's not different? iOS. All the pros and cons are still there. The front camera is also still VGA. While the graphics processor got a nice bump the CPU itself is still the same dual-core.I'm really disappointed Apple didn't improve the front camera.  A VGA camera on a screen this good is just a joke.  The rear camera, a camera I used maybe a dozen times in my ownership of my iPad 2 gets a massive upgrade but the camera I've used for hours of video chat is left where it was (even a year ago the VGA camera was terrible).  I can only assume it was left off to provide some feature for the next iPad.  What this product ultimately highlights now are the shortcomings with iOS. Aside from putting a better front camera in the device and addressing some of the backwards steps with the iPad 3 (temp, weight) there's really nothing else Apple can do with this device.  The main hold over from the iPad 2 was the screen and that's been solved now.  Apple needs to, and appears to be doing (but slowly), work on the OS itself.  It's somewhat troubling that by and large iOS 5.1 looks and operates the same as iOS3 and 4.  The most notable of improvements has been the addition of the multitouch gestures and the addition of the notification system.  All nice additions but they don't really represent 2 years worth of changes.In comparison to the iPad 2 this is a nice upgrade, but ultimately it's not enough.  I'm not sure anything could have been enough to be honest though, but the fact that it runs hotter and is heavier don't help it in comparison.  While the screen is appreciable, the screen on the iPad 2 is still amazing in it's own right. If anything it's not a comment on poor quality of the new iPad but rather just that the iPad 2 was already so good.  The new iPad is a worthwhile upgrade from the original iPad or great for a first time buyer.Pros:++Screen++Extra RAM+iPhone and iPod touch based games now use their retina display apps for upscaling on the iPad (this is a REALLY nice improvement when you do use it).Cons:--Front facing camera is still the same-no new OS version = same old same old (e.g. no Siri)In addition, I'd like to compare this to Android tablets in general as I own both.  Android itself represents a better operating system.  Notifications are better, multitasking is better, and just the general usability of the device is better - especially with regard to the home screen.  What Android tablets fail to deliver, however, is the smoothness and richness that iOS offers.  Scrolling on a webpage in iOS versus in Android is just effortless.  It really shows off the imperfections of Android in general, much like how Android shows off the short comings of iOS.  The other issue is app selection.  Android doesn't have the heavy media hitters.  No Hulu Plus, no Xfinity, no HBO Go, no EA games, and just a general lack of quality applications (Android 2.2/2.3 based tablets and the Kindle Fire are exceptions but I'm focused on iOS 5 versus Honeycomb or ICS).  While the Google apps are hands down better on the Android side, they don't make up for the lack of entertainment on the iPad.  Also to note, a lot of the Android apps really don't feel like they take any advantage of the screen size difference, many of the apps feel just like scaled up phone applications where as iPad apps seem to have more thought put in to them for the extra size.While Android often times offers better and more features in it's core implementation, none of that matters when there's so little in comparison to do.  And nearly none of the things they both do are done as well on Android or as smoothly.  Yes, I miss widgets, GTalk integration, and a variety of other things when I use my iPad, but I ultimately use it a lot more because there's more to do.  If you own an Android phone (I do) there's not much really the tablet can do that my phone can't do already, so ultimately it just feels pointless.And I think that's a good point to consider.  Unless you hate Apple/iTunes, if you own an Android phone you'd probably be better off with an iPad to complement the phone.  Likewise might hold true for people who own an iPhone, an Android tablet might be better than the iPad.In the end, if you're looking for a tablet, get the new iPad.  Android may do more things on the front, but there's just less to do on it in most cases.  If you already own an original iPad or an Android tablet - this is worth the upgrade.  However, if you own an iPad 2, unless you really need LTE (and you won't tether your phone) this is a pass.  I made the change to get more storage space primarily (32GB wasn't cutting it anymore) but if not for that I'd have kept the iPad 2 instead.

I'm glad I got the one with 32gigs of storage! Although my primary motivation for getting the IPad was for the wonderful apps, which are way better than the ones on the IPod touch, mainly because of the bigger screen. I decided to sync the IPad with my ITunes library and that filled up 16.5gigs, but the photos and movies look great on the IPad, and make them easier to share with friends and family, the music, not so much. Anyway, with the extra hard drive space I wont have to worry about running out of space, at least for the next year or two. I'm sure to replace this IPad with a later model by then and hopefully it will have a port for an SD card. I ordered through Amazon for 2nd day delivery, and it got here on time and undamaged. One thing that I liked about my Ipod touch was the weather app, on the IPad the weather app is not included, but if you buy the WeatherBug Elite app, you not only get detailed weather, current and forcast with dangerous weather alerts, but you also can watch the national weather forcast on the WeatherBug.com website!

Its not like people were in the streets up in arms about the iPad2 screen quality, its amazing. The iPad1 & 2 are still the 2nd and 3rd best tablets---for performance and value---on the market.My 3 year old jammed the business side of a fork into my iPad2 USB port (effectively ending my relationship with my home button) about 2 months before the 3 was released....so....I knew I'd be getting this.I use the iPad all day. It dies on me everyday. Let's cover just a few items for what and why:1. I use it all day, everyday. If I'm not sending an email, browsing or reading the news (flipboard will change your world) then its in my office on my desk playing a CNBC or Fox News etc. video. This isn't the X brand tablet that will sit and sit like so many others.......2. Yes, its for consuming content. 90% of what I do is consume text/video/game with this device. Its replaced my newspaper and all of mags but I prefer my ol' black and white Kindle for long form reading. This is the greatest screen ever made ---but its bright. And that can be a hinderance for long reading session. And it flat out sucks to use outside i.e. poolside or at the beach etc. If you want a reader, this isn't for you. I would highly recommend the black and white Kindle. Yes, it has the iWork suite and I do use this for work occasionally but I have to be honest and reluctantly admit until Office is available this kind of work will be limited on the tablet.3. 3.4 million pixels. Yes, its the greatest screen ever made. People complained that Apple focused too much on this SUBSTANTIAL improvement and not something else but they are shortsighted. The entire device IS the screen, its the most intimate and prominent  feature. Therefore drastic improvement to this elemental piece means something. Its that good.WhyThis isn't going to replace the laptop or the desktop. Its not an iPhone. In terms of taking away time spent on the desktop and laptop---YES, people will spend less time on those devices then they otherwise would. But, again, for long form spreadsheets, letters or long emails, media editing etc.---the iMac or whatever desktop/laptop you use will still be choice.

Being able to fit 4x as much information on the screen is fantastic. Text remains sharp even when very small. SpeedTest on LTE from AT&T; topped out at 27 Mbps down and 14 Mbps up. Wish the data plans weren't so stingy, because at this rate you can blow through your month's allotment of 2GB in 10 minutes of downloading... but that's really AT&T;'s fault, not Apple's.Usability is second to none. I'm a pure Windows guy and even I concede defeat here. The iPad is intuitive and easy to use. It's also very responsive. Snappy when it switches back and forth between apps. Pinch/zoom and flipping motions are fluid. Android tablets are getting better all the time, but the iPad is still king here.Battery life is pretty good. With light use, I charge it probably every 2-3 days.With more apps being updated to take advantage of the high resolution display, I find more and more of my storage space being stealthily consumed. With 75 apps, 100 songs, 3 videos, and about 150 pictures, my 16GB iPad has about 5GB of free storage. If you're someone who feels the need to carry more of your music or video collection with you, you'll probably want the 32GB version.The iPad is locked down, so you're limited to the Apple-approved apps you can install through the App Store. This has always been a curse and a blessing. The experience is refined, but power users can feel confined. You can always jailbreak it, though at the expense of your warranty.The worst part about the iPad is having to use iTunes. It's got an outdated feel. It poorly manages media folders. It's a memory hog. It's got limited support for music formats. It stealthily tries to install Safari and QuickTime at every update.

I don't need the 3G/Wi-Fi version so I purchased the 16GB Wi-Fi only version. Nothing changed on the design compared to the iPad 2 but the New iPad is a hairline thicker. What's great with The New iPad is the new faster processor (A5x), Improved Camera and the Retina Display.The new Apple A5x chip is awesome. It runs at a 1GHz dual core processor and a Quad Core GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) with 1GB of RAM which delivers a very great responsive experience.  It is very quick on opening applications, watching videos or playing games.The Retina display resolution is 2048 x 1536 which doubles the resolution of the iPad2.  Has a bright contrast and great viewing angles.  No problems using it outdoors, great for reading and watching movies.  You also get Video Out (using the charger slot on the buttom) on the New iPad but you need to get an optional digital AV adapter to get that feature to work.Love the Camera: The new improve 5MP iSight Camera which features an F2.4 lens sensor with back side lumination. The shutter button is now position on the right side for easy access compared from the previous one which is located on the buttom. Another improvement is the 1080p High Definition Video Recorder which moves at 29 frames per second.  It also has an Anti-Shake features to help capture that great video even if you have that shaky hands.Voice Dictation Service is another new feature if you don't want to type your messages, great for that long email replies.If you get the AT&T; or Verizon version, the micro sim slot card is on the left side of the tablet.Another great aspect that I love with the new iPad is Battery Life.

I received the iPad 3 16GB (wifi only) model as a gift two months ago and it has been working flawlessly and I love it. I love Android devices too, however, I had a bad experience with the one I bought and I regretted not spending the extra $100 on the iPad earlier.Pros:I have had zero problems with the iPad. The display is very bright (but I usually keep it at a low setting). The whole device is built to feel very durable and responsive. My previous tablet, every time I tapped the screen, I felt like I had to be extra careful because it always felt like it was so delicate and would shatter. The battery life lasts for three days for me on average, even with a decent amount of game playing. It's easy to set up. Has a lot of accessories you could find for it with no problems everywhere.. even in a street stand in NYC. I also haven't had the problem where it heats up easily even with games.It is fast and the experience of using it is very smooth. It shuts off quickly, turns on quickly, loads apps quickly. I love the multi-touch gestures. I can switch between apps with no lags and no freezes.Cons:16GB should be sufficient, but sometimes I feel like these apps are huge and will deem this 16GB model as \"not standard\" anymore. In fact, three games I downloaded raged at the 500-550MB size. And since the storage isn't exactly 16GB, it leaves me with even less space. You could always use cloud storage for other files like photos and music, but you'd always have to have internet to access those files so try to leave the least used stuff in cloud storage.I'll also have to admit that the iPad does take a long time to charge. I think it took about 4 hours to charge, two days ago. Another con is that it's a bit heavy and a bit thicker. It's not very noticeable compared to the iPad 2, but for general use and holding it up to read, it does get tiring, so this might not be the device mainly for extensive reading with one hand.There's also no SD slot where you can expand memory, but then again, I realized many other tablet manufacturers stopped doing that also. I don't mind anyway as I feel like the SD slot would just ruin the design of the iPad.

In other words, I couldn't determine how a new tablet would fit into my technology product suite and not simply overlap with other devices I own.  I already own an Andriod device via HTC's original EVO 4G (released in June-2010 and still running Android 2.3.5 - Gingerbread) and I was extremely impressed with the operating system from Google.  I've also NEVER owned any Apple products and thought they were gimmicky and overpriced compared to other brands.  I needed to justify a tablet purchase, so I narrowed the research between Asus Prime 300 (not the Transformer one with the WiFi issues), Samsung Galaxy Tab 2, and the new iPad.  I thoroughly researched and tested each tablet online and in-store and decided to take a bite out of Apple.  I've only owned for 3 days with heavy use, but will update should my experience change in the coming weeks.Hardware:  Although I thought Apple was more style than substance, I must admit that iPad is a pretty looking device.1. It is minimalistic in it's design, sleek, and seems easy for both my wife and I to hold and control.  It does seem to get warm after long use though.  As I'm sure many others have already mentioned, the retina display is gorgeous.  I've never owned a tablet before, but did test the Asus and Samsung and this one is definitely ahead.  It makes browsing the web, looking at photos, and just about everything else you do with a tablet a more enjoyable experience.  I imagine that if I never saw the iPad display I would have never missed it, but boy, after you see this thing it makes looking at other screens harder.2. I also thoroughly enjoy using the camera.  I initially thought a 5 megapixel camera (compared to my 8 MP camera on my EVO) would be a disappointment, but I was surprised by the quality.  Although it doesn't have a flash, it still takes quality pictures in decent light.  I've also learned that camera sensor quality and arpeture (sic) play a huge role in picture quality and not the megapixel count, so my guess these are at play here.3. I really haven't used the speakers or headphone jack, so I can't speak to those, but overall, I think Apple did a great job with the tabgible aspects of this tablet, especially compared to others I tested.Operating System:  Again, I was accustomed to the flexibility of using Android with my smartphone and thought it was an ingenious concept to allow the user more control.  I'm a thirty-something and technologically sophisticated, so I wasn't intimidated by setting up an Android device.  I had always heard that Apple took a simpler approach with their devices, so I was curious to see this in action.1. Obviously, more tech savy users will prefer Android over Apple (performance aside) because it is extremely customizable.  Android 4 (Ice Cream Sandwich) is probably ahead in this category for users like myself, but for those users that won't demand this flexibility, I think iOS is fine.  Besides, I have become discouraged by the amount of time it takes Android to deploy their operating system updates to the various devices.  And of course, yesterday Apple announced iOS 6 by this fall.  I've heard that several Android tablets still don't have the latest ICS operating system even though it's been out for several months.  In the end, if you prefer flexibility over simplicity, then stick with an Android tablet.  If you don't care or won't use the flexilbity to its fullest potential, then Apple is just fine.2. I actually found the Apple  to be more flexible than I thought based on research before I bought the tablet.  I heard many Android fans complain about it.  Sure, not as flexible as Android, but I imagine that many tablet users over the age of 40-45 probably won't care or even notice.  And those under 40, most probably won't even explore the benefits of Android (just like when people overpaid for 1080P tv sets and didn't even use Blu-ray that much).  I haven't seen any hangups or crashes that I had become used to with my Android device.  I know I comparing a smartphone to a tablet, but I know operating system issues when I see them.  I can't tell you how many times my smartphone has crashed and needed to be restarted after doing simple tasks.  I've run my new tablet through the mud and it continues to come through without any hitches.3. The performance is very crisp compared to the Android tablets I tested.  I know this can be hardware and operating system related, but I feel like this tablet just outperforms the others and delivers rapid response without any lag.  I almost started to cry when I double tapped a picture and it zoomed right away.  With my Android phone, I have to pray when I double tap that it won't crash and kick me out of my picture gallery.  I get frustrated when I tap on something and nothing happens.  And then get in more trouble when I tap again only to find out that it was just hung up trying to start.  I haven't experienced this yet with my tablet.  And before you criticize, I did experience some lag and crashes when testing the Android tablets too.Software (Apps):  Apple's library of apps is far superior to Android ,and they are even organized better to separate tablet apps from phone apps.  Although Apple doesn't offer as many free apps, they all seem to work well within the tablet and never crash.1. They also seem to have more apps optimized for the screen resolution.  I actually downloaded about 25 free apps the other day and they only used about 1 GB, so it seems that buying the low memory tablet won't stop me from enjoying dozens or hundreds of apps as long as I don't store too many photos, music, and video............and even then, iCloud offers 5 GB of free storage that can sync to your Mac or PC.2. The apps that come with the tablet aren't much to speak of, but the App store has too many nice ones to name............and surprisingly there are several good ones that are still free.Overall:  I never thought I could be convinced to buy an Apple product.  I used to make fun of relatives that bought their Apple laptops at prices greater than $1,000 for something I bought like a 17 inch Acer for $400 (still not sure what this big difference is for the Apple laptops).  But I must admit this tablet is worth the premium you pay compared to Android tablets, especially given the way that my family will use it.  Sure, it doesn't have USB output, expandable memory, standard HDMI output, etc, but I'm not sure that I would use those anyway.  And even if I did, there are some workarounds based on my network setup at home that are pretty easy to implement.  My wife and I will use this primarily for mobile web browsing, picture and video, game, news, finance, and productivity apps, and even offline news reading to/from work.  I might even hook up my nice Bose headphones to it once in awhile.  But based on that usage, I think we made the right decision.  I still think the Android tablets are nice too (especially the Asus brands), but iPad is a bit better for how I will be using it and for the things I think are important.  So am I a new Apple Fan Boy convert?  Only time will tell since this is my first Apple experience.  I don't think I will be buying their Macs or Macbook Pros anytime soon because I think they are way overpriced, but I really like what they have done with this tablet even though it's about $100 more than the competition at $499.  It suits my needs and I hit the lottery in that it will be updated with more features through iOS 6 this fall.", "Date": "June 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "I-pad 3", "Author": "kens amazon", "ReviewID": "R386LKVBQUHLVH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Got it for my wife, she loves it see her playing with it all the time!!! dont know much about it myself but as long as she is happy, you know the rest!", "Date": "May 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love my iPad!", "Author": "OC shopper", "ReviewID": "R37B6TTV3X6YAP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got my iPad for use in my MBA program, which uses all eBooks.

I'm familiar with Apple products ranging from the iMac, Macbook, iPhone(s), iPod(s) and iPad(s).  I owned the first gen iPad while my wife owns the second gen.  After all of this time I knew it was time to upgrade.  My 1st gen. iPad was slowing down and the laggy moments were really starting to get to me.  I don't like to wait....I admit it, Im impatient!So after getting irritated with some lag I ordered the iPad 3.  Immediately there is a huge speed increase compared to the 1st gen.  Compared to the 2nd gen, you won't notice much of anything.  What you will notice of course is the screen.  It looks absolutely amazing.  Very clear.  Perfect.So what else is there to say?  It's light (compared to the 1s gen, almost the same as the 2nd) an roughly the same size.  I'm using the Apple case from the 1st gen for this one even though it is a bit loose.  I had to punch a small hole in the back for the camera but that was easy enough.  The camera works great and takes good photos in 'house' lighting.  No flash but that's ok with me.  I usually taking random photos and not counting on this as my primary camera.  All in all, it's better than the 2nd gen, worse than a point and shoot.  Video is good quality though.  Not bad at all.Battery life is like the other iPads.....AWESOME!  No issues with it being hot (it does get luke-warm).For me this is the king of the tablets.  I have android tablets and they are good but not great.  When it comes to having something that simply works and works very well, then you can't beat Apple and the iPad.  You can do the same with other tablets but not as easily or as seamless.  That I assure you.I'll update in the future.", "Date": "May 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good for Reading", "Author": "Ghazali", "ReviewID": "R27BG1981LZWXH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I didn't buy the first and second generation iPads because I didn't like the resolution.

The only issue is the screen glaring which is not comfortable if sitting nearby the light source.IMHO it's worth to upgrade from iPad two if you read a lot of text and watch HD videos on netflix. For other uses like occasional browsing, reading emails and gaming: The iPad 2 is a good option for a lower price.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "The best 9.7 inch tablet I have ever used!", "Author": "jjceo", "ReviewID": "R1UQGTAYSMPCIL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What's included?The device is packaged nicely and the box includes the iPad charger rated at 2.1 Amps at 5.1 VDC. It also includes a USB to iPad cable for use with the power supply and it also interfaces with your computer to connect to iTunes. The cable is only 41 inches long which is always one of my pet peeves because when you plug the charger in the wall the cable is too short to allow you to reach to the top of a dresser for example and charge the product at night. The first thing you will do is buy a USB male to female extender cable or buy the Apple extended version charger at $29 cost to charge the unit properly.You also get a one page instruction card that basically says to turn on the unit and follow the directions. You also get the important product information guide and two white apple logos to use as you desire.Set up* Turn it on and select your language and touch next.* Select your country and touch next.* It will ask you if you want to have the unit identify the location of where you are at. Select yes as this is important for later tracking of the device if it is stolen.* Activate networks, which in my case was only WIFI. Select your SSID from the list of possible connections, enter in your password, if your network is protected. Touch next.* Activate your Apple ID using your e-mail address and your Apple password.* Accept the Apple terms.* It will then start a set up.* It asks if you want to use the cloud option for communication and uploading and downloading.* It asks if you want to use the dictation mode when you touch the microphone on the keyboard.* The iPad then does some diagnostics and loading.* It asks you if you are ready to register the product with Apple.* It then tells you that you are ready to use the iPad.Attach the unit to your computer that has iTunes installed, (make sure you are using the latest version):* When you plug in the iPad it asks if you want to set it up as a new iPad or to use the data of an existing iPad. I selected New iPad.* It asks you to select an iPad name. Make sure that it is unique so that you don't confuse iTunes into thinking you have two devices with the same name.* The iPad is set to auto sync and I stopped that as my music files are to large for the 64 GIG memory. I select only the music, videos, and photos I want to sync.* The unit will begin to sync your data and it will install all of your existing apps you own as long as you have not exceeded the limit of 5 Apple devices using those apps.* Your apps are all loaded as single apps and if you want you have to combine them into folders and name the folders. This took me about an hour as we own over 200 apps. The list was 10 pages long.* I then told the iPad to sync with my contacts, calendar and with two email accounts using Outlook. Don't forget you will have to enter in your ISP email account password for each email account you sync with before your e-mail will be down loaded.* All of these steps occurred without error and they happened very quickly. This unit is faster than the iPad 2 device and it clearly shows while processing these steps.Installing Kindle Reader app.* I use the Kindle reader app a lot and it was already installed above by the app installation process.* Touch the Kindle app and it will ask you for your Amazon ID and password. Almost instantly it tells you that you can look at your books in the Cloud and you will start to load up the book covers. Each cover will have a downward pointing arrow on it to indicate that it has not been downloaded to your device.* Touch each cover and the book will download. I have a very good WIFI and each book only took seconds. I own about 350 Kindle books and the process was very fast. You can touch 10 to 15 books and it will download them sequentially and very quickly.* When you are reading a book and want to look up a word in the dictionary, the first time it will ask you if you want to download the dictionary to your device. Select yes and it takes about 5 seconds to do this. Look up of words is virtually instantaneous.* You will notice the outstanding quality of the display as the text looks like a printed page with perfect resolution and dark text. It is impressive!Find iPhone* Touch the Find iPhone icon* Enter in your Apple ID and Password and touch Go.* The application will then locate all of your Apple devices assigned to your account. You can now look at each location either on a map or even a satellite view. If your iPad does not show up then go to settings and touch Location Services and turn on Find My iPad and Status Bar Icon. You will be able to locate your device within about 10 to 20 feet!* It is critical that you set this up as you can now track your device if it is lost or stolen!* You can also make the missing device, Play a Sound, Remote Lock, Remote Wipe, and even allow it to send you an e-mail when the device is found.SecurityThis is one of Apple's shining stars regarding security. By touching settings for example you can set Auto-Lock to on, select a Passcode Lock and set restrictions. By doing this you can lock your iPad with a simple or more complex passcode (recommended) so that if it is stolen you will not lose your data to a hacker. Under restrictions the list is 21 items long. You can give this device to a child and turn off the web browsing, social networks, buying games and products, dictation, installing and deleting apps, etc...This product is professionally designed and if you are giving this to a child (or even giving them an iPod) you can lock these features and feel secure that they have access to only the things you want them to have. You can even assign age limits for music, shows, movies, apps, etc.. It is the best security setup available today.Web browsingUnbelievably fast! This is where the strength of the new processor shows and the speed of the WIFI connection is wonderful. It is virtually as fast as my 1GHz wired Ethernet connected computer. The streaming of video is fast and flawless.Face TimeThe advantage of having a front and rear facing camera is that you can call anyone using a iPhone 4 or iPad 2 or the new iPad and talk to them and see them simultaneously if they are connected to a good WIFI connection. The new cameras on this iPad are 5 Mega pixels and you will see the difference immediately. The video and picture are extremely clear.Face Time is very nice and if you want you can even swap camera front to back so instead of the person you called seeing you they can see what you are seeing. This is a very nice and powerful feature.TypingTyping is smooth and fast. You cannot type with two thumbs (as the screen is too wide) and it is better to rotate the device to landscape mode and get a good sized keyboard to type on. I can almost type as fast on the iPad as I can on a full size computer keyboard.E-mailThis set up immediately and downloaded 50 e-mails into each account in about a minute. The e-mail system is easy to use and to respond on. It set up two email accounts for me in about 1 minute to set up and 1 minute to download the 50 e-mails.AppsApple has the best app store in the market. Amazon is getting better but Apple has a head start. Literally, \"There is an app for that!\" is not a joke but a reality. All of my 200 apps loaded via iTunes in about 20 minutes and we have a lot of them.CameraThe new 5 Megapixel camera is very nice. The quality is instantly recognizable in every photo and video you take. You actually record video in 1080P HD quality and between the camera and the display you will be amazed at how good the result is.There is no flash on the camera so that is an issue in low lighting.One of the advantages of the iPad is the number of high quality apps that can be used to tweak your photographs and make them look professional. We own several of these apps and the results can be spectacular. You can literally make a professional looking photography show using these apps and with this improved camera the results will even be better.Dictation and microphoneUsing the iPad Notes function you can touch the microphone on the keyboard and dictate to the iPad. I dictated this paragraph and it translated it to text with fewer typing errors than I did while typing this section. After you finish dictation, just retouch the microphone on the keypad and the voice recording will be converted to text.FacebookSet up of Facebook was fast and easy. Just enter your e-mail address and then your Facebook Password and you are on line. The quality of the pictures looks much better on the display as long as the person who set them up used a high quality photo.iTunes music and moviesI have input every CD and audio book I own into iTunes. I also have loaded MP4 movies into iTunes and they can be played on the iPad with very good results. They literally are HD quality. I purchased a 64 GIG version white iPad 3 to have the space to load as much music, photos, and videos as I can onto the device and use it for an entertainment center. I loaded 200 apps at 9.5 GIG and 350 Kindle books and I still have almost 48 GIG of free memory left for my other items!GamingI won't spend a lot of time here but just to say that we all know that the Apple products have some of the best gaming apps available. They vary from action games, sports games, strategy games, puzzle games and tower defense style games. Make sure that you buy the HD version of the games for the iPad in order to take advantage of the new display features.DisplayThe 9.7 Retina Display; 2048 x 1536 resolution produces razor sharp pictures and text. You simply have to see it to believe it. This screen has 3.1 million Pixels and is powered by a quad core graphics chip. The first three things I noticed were the quality of the pictures and videos and the text is crisper and darker.BatteryThis design has up to 10 hours of battery life even with all of these features. This makes the Apple iPad a truly enjoyable device when you know that you can listen to music, read, watch videos and work on photos for 10 hours and not have to worry about recharging or being tied to a power cable.Cons* No flash on the camera.* No 7\" tablet available for a lower price and portability.* Power and connection cable 41\" long, way too short in my opinion.* High price, demanded by the quality but still a gulp when you buy one!", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "IPad 3", "Author": "Debra Krause", "ReviewID": "R1VECTSBIXK31", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really love my ipad.

It is processor intensive use after all.I find it very comfortable to hold, especially in the leather folio I purchased to carry it in.  It's like carrying around a fairly normal weight book, which is pretty astounding in it's own right.But I daily experience awe at the power this thing has.  From business applications to photo editing to games, this does almost everything I use my computer for.  If I didn't need real Photoshop, a huge hard drive, or struggle over some of the websites that apple refuses to support (ahem flash), I might be able survive with the ipad alone.

I love that all my music is on iTunes Match now so I can listen to anything in my list while I'm out and about.  There is so much to love here!If I had any complaints, I would say the camera needs a flash.  It's fairly silly to assume that what you are photographing will be in the right light.  It's much more likely that it won't.  So that's kind of a bummer.  I can't figure out a fix for this one.Syncing with my google accounts was a bit of hassle.  I had to read up on how to make my google contacts sync with the native contacts app.  But once it was set up then I didn't have to think about it.The really short cord was kind of annoying especially with the suggestion that we ought to remain tethered to the outlet.

Still a Great Product!", "Author": "Irineo Placido-Lopez", "ReviewID": "RIAXYJW0WQHAY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This  is a review of the Apple iPad 3 or the \"New\" iPad as Apple likes to call it. The main question is, should I buy this? The answer will vary from person to person, but I can help you decide to see if it's worth it. First of all, let's take a look at what is new in this version of the iPad. Please note this review will be long so only read the parts that interest you. If you are truely curious, feel free to read the entire thing.Top Things in the NEW iPad: The A5X chip with quad-core graphics drives four times the pixels of iPad 2. The A5X chip is the main thing in the New iPad. It is what delivers the New Stunning Retina Display! With a 2048-by-1536 resolution you can't argue that the New iPad obviously has a way better screen than any other iDevice. With an amazing 10 hours of battery, the new display is really going to get noticed. Due to the fact it now has the A5X chip, the iPad is a lot faster and has really amazing graphics! The new 5MP Eye Sight camera is also something that is really enjoyed on the new iPad. Even though most people aren't really used to taking pictures with a 9.7 inch display tablet this update might encourage people to do so.Now, Let's get into detail. I will break up the review in segments in order to make it more convinient for you all.==== The A5X Chip ====You might be asking, \" Is the new chip really such a difference?\" The answer to this question is, yes. The new A5X chip, although not seen, is what makes the new iPad so great. It is the source behind the improved graphics, faster responces, and even the really improved Retina Display! Trust me, the new iPad is something truely amazing!==== 5 Mega Pixel Eye Sight Camera ====The new rear camera on the iPad is now a 5 Mega Pixel Eye Sight camera! What is Eye sight ? Let me put it this way. It is similar to professional DSLR Cameras with Autofocus. That's right, the new iPad has similar features to professional DSLR's. With really good Macro Focus and all-around high quaity pictures. Although 5 Mega Pixels is not that high, the pictures still look really nice on the iPad's Retina Display. MegaPixels matter, but there are other things like Aperature and shutter speed that have a dramatic effect on pictures. This is what is new on the iPad's camera. There is stilll room for improvement in the cameara. They could add a Flash which would make the camera truely spectacular. For now though, the camera is definitely a great improvement from the iPad 2.==== The Battery Life ====Now the battery life on the new iPad can vary from user to user. If you are those types of people that enjoy having the Best Display at all times the battery life is going to be reduced drastically. You can get more life by changing the screen brightness. The iPad has a nice feature to it called Auto-Brightness. This enables the iPad to automatically turn the brightness of the screen higher when you are outdoors and when you are indoors it automatially lowers the brightness to the point where it is just right. On auto-brightness the battery can still last a good 10 continuous hours. This means using it 10 hours non stop. Of course most people don't do this. They leave it on standby. If you only use it a couple of times per day the life can range to maybe 2 full days. Since the battery is larger and it lasts longer it takes more time to charge than an iPod or an iPhone.==== The Display ====As I mentioned before, the display is amazing on the new iPad; however, it is something so great that I can't cover in a review. The best way to decide is seeing it for yourself. I would recommend seeing one in person for you can truely observe the new display with your own eyes.With all of this said, What can an iPad Really do? I will answer this in the sections below...An iPad is basically a computer in some words. It can really be a computer with the right accessories. Some required things to take full advantage of an iPad are:* A wireless printer that supports Apple's Air Print.* An Apple TV to stream with Air Play.* A Bluetooth wireless keyboard that is supported with the iPad* A good case to protect your iPad.Let's take a look at what an iPad can truely do...==== Air Play ====If you have an Apple TV you can stream wirelessly to your HDTV. For Example, If you want to share some pictures with your family, now you can with Air Play. You can wirelessly send infromation to Your HDTV in which you will be able to see pretty much everything you see on your iPad. From Youtube videos to Photos to even Netflix.==== Air Print ====If you have a wireless printer that supports Air Print you can now print straight from your iDevice. For example, you have a PDF file that you just edited or a really great Picture that you just took. With Air Print you can print this from basically anywhere in the world. Even if you are in another county you can send an e-mail to your printer and your printer will wirelessly & Automatically start printing out whatever you sent it! This is someething truely amazing!==== Games & Apps ====With an iPad you have a wide variety of applications and games that you can install on it. With Apple's App sotre there are literally hundreds of apps to choose from with most ranging from FREE to around $5. There are two types of applications on iPads. There are normal apps that were meant for use with an iPod Touch or an iPhone and then there are HD Apps. The High Definition apps were meant for iPad only and they look a lot better than iPhone Apps; however, both are fully functional. The Games will look a lot better on the new iPad as it now has the A5X chip.==== Dictation ====Dictation is a new feature on the iPad. It allows you to speak text. An example would be writing a note in the notes section of the iPad. Instead of typing it out slowly, you can now just say it and the iPad will turn it into text! Save time by literally talking to your iPad. This is also very helpful when sending e-mails.==== Siri ? ====Apple has released to us that in its new update that is coming soon it will allow the new iPad to be used with Siri! The main feature that made the iPhone 4S such a big hit is now going to be integrated into the iPad. Just another great reason to buy an iPad 3.==== iOS ====iOS is the magic behind the  iPad. It lets you see and do everything using Multi-Touch. Apple likes to boast about it being the worlds most advanced mobile oberating system. With every update making it even better, this is a true reason to buy an Apple Device.==== iCloud ====iCloud is new in ios 5 allowing your iPad to update its self with the \"cloud\" wirelessly of course! You no longer need to own a computer to own an iPad because of this amazing new feature! It also allows you to store all of your apps, music, and movies in the cloud! With this said, it automatically pushes all of your pictures, apps, etc to all of your other iDevices wirelessly! It also allows you to restore an iPad and get all of your contacts and information automatically if you ever have to restore an iPad.Overall:This is a truely outstanding product that is just amazing. The only reason why this is not a 5 Star product is because it tends to be hot! Literally it gets really hot if you use it for around 2 hours. This and the fact that it can still be improved in some areas. Overall though it is a great product that I would not hesitate to buy. I recommend this product for everyone who is looking for a Tablet. I hope that this review helped you guys out. If it did please feel free to say that it helped you out in the buttons below. Thanks.", "Date": "August 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice Tablet, have a Kindle Fire to compare", "Author": "W. Moore", "ReviewID": "R1SRUTWOQOHYBB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a very nice tablet.  The screen is very clear and detailed.I have a Kindle Fire, so will compare that to the Ipad3.  I know they are priced much differently, but I have a Kindle and was questioning if the Ipad3 was a good upgrade.First the obvious:Apple has a bigger screen.IOS vs AndroidMain menus:The IPAD main menu scrolls smoother between screens and when opening applications.  The Kindle default Amazon interface is kind of lame and too simple, however I use a side loaded app called Go Launcher on the Kindle.Go Launcher has onscreen buttons for home and back (which is the same type of interface on an Android).  With the Ipad you have to press the hard button over to the side to go back to the home menu.On screen buttons like with Go Launcher are nice, example... if I am in email then open a url this will open up the web browser.  When I want to return back to that email I simply just press the onscreen back button while in web browser and this will take me back to the email I was just looking at.With the Ipad if you are in email and press on a url the web browser opens as normal, but you have to press the hard button to get out of the browser and back to the app menu, and then press the email app.  This seems kind of redundant to me.  Another option with the Ipad3 is you can hit the home button twice to access your open apps and press the email program.The Android onscreen navigation buttons are more intuitive for this purpose.Screen:The Kindle Fire screen looks very good but looking closely (12 inches away) I can still see the pixelation on smaller pictures.The Ipad Retina is for sure more clear and sharp.  The pictures are more vivid and detailed.  Text looks much sharper.Internet:Ipad3 web browsing is faster than the Kindle but there are still some occasional delays when scrolling down a webpage on the Ipad, but much less than the Kindle Fire.  Using the Safari browser is more responsive.  The larger screen on the IPAD3 is way nicer for web browsing.  With the Kindle Fire there is a lot more side scrolling going on and moving around the screen to browse the web.The onscreen keyboard:Ipad is very responsive and I don't feel like I have to guess if the onscreen key I hit was registered.The Kindle was not as responsive.  While the onscreen keyboard is good, there times when the Kindle just seems to hiccup and not register an onscreen key.Email:The Ipad built in email integrates with my MS Live account.The Kindle built in email doesn't work with MS Live, you have to get a different program which really sometimes does not pull up new email and the navigation is clunky.Music streaming:Pandora Radio works fine on both.  The Ipad has one speaker, and the Kindle has two for stereo affect.  The Kindle sound is very good for the price, but when tilted horizontally the speakers are on the left side and one of the speakers gets covered up when held up.  I think the Ipad3 sound is better, however the speaker faces away so the sound can be distant when propped up.Video streaming:Netflix on the Ipad3 is way better; the movies look clear and stream in HD.  The Kindle movies look blotchy and appear to be playing at a lower resolution.Google maps and locationing:Kindle Fire has no location positioning for locationing apps.The Ipad3, has no GPS, but can still use wireless positioning to locate the Ipad location like in Google Maps._____________So the Ipad3 is way better than the Kindle, surprise!!  My only gripe is there are no onscreen navigation buttons to jump to other applications.  Pressing the hard button is not a big issue, but I rather only use that button sparingly.I like the Ipad3 for most tasks including email, browsing the web, streaming movies.I like the Kindle Fire for compact use and I prefer the smaller size for traveling lightly.", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "The screen is so much more noticeable /clearer compared to the iPad 2.

Johnson", "ReviewID": "R1JK70QRWY58PM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The two most important features as compared to the iPad 2 and the new iPad are the amazing resolution and this speech to text dictation.I am now using the dictation to write this review and it seems so much better than Nuance Dragon Natural Speaking. Combined with the new resolution, which is much noticeably better than the iPad 2, it seems worth the upgrade. If you sell your iPad 2 you are only lose about $150; Apple products hold their value. Apple has created a system for apps, which makes which makes the new iPad available to download your current apps in four times the resolution; Web browsing and Kindle texts looks so much clearer on the new iPad. If you are a blogger or WordPress, Joomla or just an every day emailer there is no point in having a external keyboard for the new iPad. The voice to text dictation is a huge bonus.Cons:Although the front facing camera is adequate for Skype and FaceTime the resolution is not as good as other cameras for taking clear pictures. Another con compared to the iPad 2 is that the battery takes very long to charge. Although the backward facing 1080P camera may seem good on paper it is not as good as one would think. Like me, not many people use their iPad for recording videos anyway.Also, like the iPad 2 the Wi-Fi antenna is not nearly as good as a laptop or desktop computer.16 GB is really all you need, most people don't even use half of the space. Streaming music or videos does not require any extra GBs, however if you use it as your main camcorder, download video/music directly to your iPad consider getting more space or more than 16GB. If you are a big traveler and have the money go with the LTE version, otherwise the Wi-Fi version is all you need.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Kind of a dissapointment", "Author": "Serpentiz", "ReviewID": "R1WTV6KJW1IU0E", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought the new iPad because of the retina display, it is my first Apple device. The retina display is beautiful, but I found more cons about the device then I found pros. They say once you go mac, you never go back, but I have to admit, I miss my Android tablet. First, let me say that this tablet seems to be built nicely, I have no qualms about the build quality of the device, other than the WiFi seems to be a bit slow. My complaints are about functionality and overall cosmetics. I was surprised to find out that I am unable to add widgets to my home screens without jail-breaking the device, really? This is something that Android users can do, and have been able to do since the dawn of time. Okay, fine, I can get past that. Next, my main email address is a Gmail address. I use my Gmail account to backup all my contacts, as well as send/receive emails. There is a setting on iOS 6 (which I updated to immediately upon turning the device on) that allows you to add a Gmail account. Taking into consideration that the two companies always seem to be at each others' throats, I was happy to see this was possible, however, then I found out that, while I can add my Gmail address and receive emails from my account to the iPad, I can't sync my contacts. May I ask why? In order to sync my Gmail contacts, I had to set up my Gmail account as a Microsoft Exchange account, this is stupid, why can't I just set it up as a Gmail account and automatically sync my contacts without the extra hassle? Now, I haven't really looked, but I assume Apple offers the same kind of service, where you can receive emails, and backup contacts, etc. that I can just switch to, but why should I have to? This device is supposed to be the best tablet available, why can't it do something as simple as syncing my contacts without having to use a work-around? Next, I have an Amazon account, and tons of books I've downloaded through Kindle. I found the Kindle app on the app store, and it works great for reading, then I found out you can't buy books through the app. Really? I have to go to the amazon website through Safari. Well, Apple has iBooks ... okay so to be able to do something as simple as purchasing and downloading e-books through the app itself, I have to re-purchase my entire library? This is ridiculous, in the Android Kindle app, you can do this, so it has to be Apple that for some reason decided they wouldn't allow this functionality with the app available to iOS devices. So, okay, I can get past all that as long as it reliably works right? Wrong. One of the biggest aspects this tablet is built for is gaming. There are great games on the app store, and the iPad is supposed to play them without a problem. So I go to try a game and start playing, after about 15 minutes, the device over-heated and the game crashed. There are other aspects about the iPad that I don't like, there's no HDMI out without having to buy a separate adapter, there's no SD card input (should be available on every tablet ever), I would've like to see an I/R blaster, but it seems only Samsung and Sony think that's a good idea, but these are my main complaints about the device. So, here I am, I like the iPad, but I find myself more often wishing I'd gone with a new Android tablet, and that's why I can't give the iPad 5 stars. And if you're an Android user looking to give the iPad a shot, like I was, all I can say is buyer beware.", "Date": "September 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great buy!", "Author": "Janie Dills", "ReviewID": "R28QD8JHKVIAB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my second purchase of this particular product from this Amazon Marketplace seller.

I already had a MacBook Pro and an iPhone so what would I do with an iPad? It seemed to be a blown up version of the iPhone (without the phone part) and an inferior version of the MacBook Pro (without the keyboard or processing power). So what the heck would I do with this iPad thing?As it turns out, I do a lot with it! I will admit that I play games on it a lot, but I also use it as my main \"to go\" item. I have it synced with my MacBook Pro and iPhone so it always contains anything that I consider important and want to always take with me (emails, notes, calendars, documents of various kinds, etc). It's my entertainment if I'm ever stuck anywhere, having to wait on something (the apps are much better on the iPad than my iPhone). I keep track of the weather and my kids (AT&T;'s Family Map plan), and the rush hour traffic (which can be a mess in the Houston area). Maps are easier to read and follow with the larger screen than they were on my iPhone. Even reading books is better on the iPad than the iPhone. And, yet, it's easier to carry around than my MacBook Pro; plus, with the cellular contract, I always have the internet available to me at all times.So as it turns out, the iPad does have its place even though I have a MacBook Pro and an iPhone. They each have their specific purposes. Even though I waited years before finally buying my first iPad, I cannot imagine not having an iPad now. And I'm very pleased with the model I selected as it runs all the current software very well and should be able to keep up with whatever comes out in the future for a long time before it becomes so obsolete that I'll have to buy a newer version.

But the ios is actually easier then windows once you know what your doing. And there is the rub. This comes with no instructions. But you do get 90 days help and can call in as many times as you want in that time frame. The service is great, real people that seem to be in California, no accents. As a befuddled \"oldster\" (but I did know windows very well) they gave me plenty of time and effort. Some things are so simple if you only knew, and reading on the \"book\" manual in the iPad's ibooks (free) can only get you so far. The touch is so responsive it took time to \"power down\" my finger compared to \"other\" touch products (my other brand smart/dumb phone, kindle fire, other people's tablets, etc.)Things to know, = makes very sure you get that 90 days service, once the box has been opened the clock starts. If you buy someone else's or a \"open box\" from some store, make sure you know how much time is left. If you are like me and didn't even know there was that service, or that I needed it, I would have been lost. Another thing is that dang password. I spent a lots of time on the phone with Apple help on this, and they kept passing me up to higher supervisors. I don't know why it was so hard, but I know I wouldn't have got \"in\" without that help. God help me if I ever forgot it.You hear fanboys and geeks talking about Apple products.

Awesome, Awesome piece of technology and tool.Now for the long version.  I had an iPhone for two years before purchasing the iPad.  I had played around with my friends when the first one came out and thought it was a fun (expensive) toy great for surfing, playing music and games.When I got the chance to get one for myself finally, I honestly wasn't sure that I would use it.  I had been given the first gen Kindle Fire and thought the UI was s#@t!  Not to mention that the Android store was neutered and I wasn't able to download any app that I wanted because of the Amazon operating system that was on it.  So even after rooting the Kindle and installing the Android operating system I was even less thrilled about the tablet idea.  The touch technology between my iPhone and Kindle were significantly different.  That difference equated to annoyance when I couldn't get the Kindle to recognize the correct link I was trying to get without having to zoom in all the time.  The iPhone would figure out what letter I was picking on a page and get it right 98% of the time... unzoomed.  What I did like was the idea of being able to not have to have my laptop around all the time (which is 17inches of screen) and that I could use it as a reader.However, I didn't want to squander my work bonus on something that would sit on the kitchen counter next to the Kindle Fire because I had no use for it.  After researching what apps were available like iWorks, Flipbook,  Note Taker HD that would serve a utilitarian purpose for my job.  I went ahead and got the iPad.  I honestly can't remember being more stoked about Apple since my first experience on the Apple IIe as a kid learning basic and playing games.  This muthafkr goes EVERYWHERE with me now along with my iPhone in my back pocket LOL!!!The clarity, visual smoothness, quality of the metal... Steve and his team really out did themselves.  As a reader, there can occasionally be some glare as I've come across when reading outside.  For a true person wanting an eReader, I think one of the other Kindles would work (Kindle Fire had glare too).

While I still love some Android tablets, thanks to now owning an iPad 3 after owning the Ipad 2 for a few months before that I can say that Android developers have to catch up BIG-TIME!  The design aesthetic and ease of use of the iOS system and the design philosophy that gets passed onto the developers who make the apps is beyond average.  I will give my impressions on a few different aspects that come to mind as far as superiority.Hardware----The aluminum unibody frame and simple design of the front just gives off a great feel of quality and even though its Chinese made it gives you an idea of what is possible for Chinese companies.  If Chinese workers can put together these high quality products, its only a matter of time before before they improve their design abilities and crack out well designed and quality over engineered products that will leave Western companies in the dust (Please remember my kind comments future Chinese overlords!)  Even the glowing green light for the FaceTime camera is a demonstration of superiority keeping in mind the amount of thought, time, and expense put into figuring out how to make it semi-transparent.  Google the article about the special machinery Apple custom designed and built just to accomplish that one simple task to make the light glow green through the material!  Its weight is very light considering the size of the battery and the retina screen.  The thinness is still pretty damned good considering all of the above features that are included.  Thanks to the uniformity of the device that they purposely kept, there are stupid amounts of available accessories that will hold, protect, or customize your hardware.  Genius!Software-----Web Browsing:Safari is one of the best mobile browsing experiences out there.  Thanks to HTML 5 I do not miss flash all that much since a lot of the video sites I thought I would be missing out on actually work pretty good.  I am able to use the browser to accomplish most tasks that there isnt an app for, or if the apps is crappy I can always pull up Safari and just act as if im on my MacBook Air.  Copy and post is really simple in the app also so that comes in handy a lot.Taking Notes:Thanks to tons of apps including Notability (which I highly recommend for all college students) that made me lugging around my backpack ALMOST irrelevant.  At the very least I could leave my laptop at home if I chose to and annotate slides from classes.Face Time:This program works great on the tablet.  I am able to have a conversation as close as possible to having the person in the room with me.  I've tried Tango, Skype, and Google Video Chat.  I just wish more people I knew had Face Time devices because I swear I would just stop making phone calls and just video conference with everyone.  Welcome overshare and having conversations in my boxers!Watching Videos:This is so convenient using ___ that I rarely use my laptop which has a bigger screen to watch videos that I have downloaded from the web including MKV files, AVI files, and mp4 files.  It has turned into my home entertainment center, car infotainment system, and my constant companion when I'm dying to watch my show and have to head to work.Calendar:Calendar works great with my Google Calendars and I can move events around and put in all kinds of related information.  Just works great, despite the fact that it relies on a Google calendar system in my case.Mail:Works great also.  Emails look good and I can easily copy and paste different parts of emails and pictures.Bottom Line:I started to write the bottom line simply because of the fact that I realized how easily I could go on and on about the different aspects of the device and speak glowingly about this tablet.  The point that should be taken from this, if you are reading this review and \"considering\" getting the new iPad just STOP and buy it.  I can guarantee that 99% of the population can come to love this device just as I have being a former Windows and Android fiend.  If I made the switch and feel this strongly about it, damn near anyone can be convinced that Apple does, not good but EXCELLENT products and software.

My first Apple product.  So far, I like it a lot.  Glorious colors, very fast downloads, enormous app store, I felt like a kid let loose in a candy shop.  I haven't had any problems with \"warm spots\" or \"hot spots\" either.  But it's not an unmixed blessing.For one thing, it's pretty heavy to carry around.  Walking 20 blocks toting an iPad in my tote bag is not the best experience I've ever had.  A smaller tablet comes in handy at times like that.For another, some apps and websites don't work as well on Apple as they do on Android.  Notable among these is Nook.  (I know nothing about Kindle because I've never used it.)  I have Nook for Android on my HTC phone and every feature works great.  There is no Nook store on Nook for iPad; to download books from Nook you have to go to the Barnes&Noble; website, navigate to NookBooks, and order from there.  Another minor cavil is that Nook for iPad doesn't have animated page-turning whereas Nook for Android does.  However, I didn't have any problem downloading my Nook library to my iPad; in fact, as soon as the app was installed, all my books downloaded immediately.  (Reading books, of course, is a lot easier on an iPad than on a cell phone because the screen is so much bigger.)The iPad bookstore is adequate; that's the most I can say for it.  It's nowhere near as comprehensive as NookBooks.  So far I've got 3 books on my iPad bookshelf and over 30 on my Nook bookshelf.I clicked on the Huffington Post website on my iPad.  Lousy scrolling and none of the comments loaded.  iPad has an app called HuffPo for iPad so I downloaded that and found out the videos don't load properly.  C'mon, Apple, you can do much better than that.  I haven't had any problem with any of the other websites I've navigated to so far.I was able to transfer all my photos and videos from my cell phone to my iPad with no problem at all.Actually, my biggest beef with the iPad is that the screen is a fingerprint magnet.  No, this screen is NOT fingerprint-resistant, I don't care what anyone tells you.  Five minutes in and the screen is absolutely covered with fingerprints.  The screen  protector for the iPad 3 is okay and solves about 95% of the fingerprint problem.  The smart cover is great for saving energy and keeping the screen free of dust and scratches.  Naturally the screen protector costs extra, but they did apply it for me at the AT@T store.  Good thing, too, or I would have gone bananas trying to get out the air bubbles.  Actually they did a commendable job.I bought the iPad with 4G from AT&T; because I don't have wi-fi at home and don't want to be limited to a wi-fi hotspot if I want to surf the internet.  The day AT&T; set my account up, the iPad worked perfectly until around midnight and all of a sudden it wouldn't connect to the server.  Next morning, it was working fine and continued to work all day with no problems until late that night when it wouldn't connect again.  I took it back to the AT@T store the following day and they told me AT&T; was having some server problems which should be fixed by that evening.  They were.  No connection problems since then.Overall, the iPad is a lot of fun.  I'm still exploring all the various apps it comes with (I absolutely love the Photo Booth) and getting used to how it works.  It's not perfect, but what is?Judy Lind", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "From  very disappointed to thoroughly impressed", "Author": "MikeT", "ReviewID": "R3MGCWXEA314YE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Received my New IPAD 32G WIFI only right on time on March 16 and promptly unboxed it and restored my latest IPAD 2 backup.  My anticipation was excited by the many articles I've read claiming that the new display is everything from your first experience seeing HDTV to a blind man getting sight.Since I had shelled out the cash for the new one and promised a family pass down for the old I was out of pocket about $1200.  So you can imagine my disappointment when I turned it on and saw nothing dramatically different from the IPAD 2.  OK let's get them both out and compare side by side.  More disappointment as there seems to be almost no difference in the visuals.  My first taught was they shipped me an IPAD 2 by mistake.  Weight, thickness, larger camera and a serial number check proved it was definitely a 3rd generation tablet.I have now had it for more than 24 hrs and can positively report I have gone from totally disappointed to thoroughly impressed.Why:Visuals from a distance of about 3 ft. when I made my comparison looked about the same but when you put It on your lap to view it at a more normal distance the display starts to pop and everything from text to pictures to movies look phenomenal.The camera is finally capable of taking excellent photographs and the HD video is with anti shake is very high quality.  Bringing photos up in IPhoto makes them look more like a printed glossy and very 3D like.Internet sites load very quickly and seem more crisp especially when you blow the size up or view a video full screen.  Download speeds tested out about 50% higher than the 2 and so did the links.My favorite racing game \"Real Racing HD\" issued an update to run on the new iPad screen and so I tried it out.  WOW first off the cars in the garage now have a life like appearance.  The game itself played very smooth at very fast speeds and the visuals were outstanding.  Even games that have not been updated yet played and looked much better.I read a lot and it was important to me that the books and online articles would provide a better experience and less eye stain than the iPad 2.  Too early to tell about the eye strain but the text on iBooks was noticeably better and pages turned smoothly.  The kindle app text was also better but pages were jerky and did not turn properly. Checked out flip boards new updated app and again the articles were all eye catching and pictures were outstanding to look at.So now I've gone from very disappointed to thoroughly impressed and glad to hand over my iPad 2.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "More expensive than Apple Hmmm", "Author": "M.

That statement is of course not entirely technologically factual. But at the end of the day, it is feels more true than the fact that there are differences in specifications between the two devices.Ram, processor -The iPad 2 in some instances felt constrained with only 512mb of ram, so the iPad 3 was supposed to feel like an improvement when it comes to app management and multitasking. However, that difference is negligible. The iPad 3 packs 1GB of ram which is the minimum amount required for an acceptable experience. But due to the fact that the iPad 3 is driving 4 times as much pixels in the screen as the iPad 2, the experience is pretty much the same. Both devices render websites at the same speed, some games are faster on the iPad 2, some games have greater detail (yeah, believe it) on the ipad 2 than the 3, etc. The design of the iPad 3 chip shows a great increase in power even though it is still is clocked at 1Ghz due do a doubling of graphic cores from 2 to 4. But testing reveals that the increase in power is entirely used to drive that high definition screen and is not felt elsewhere.Screen, application size and Internet usage -The improvements in the screen are magnificent for people who care about reading on the iPad. But then again a lot of users do not notice a difference between the screens, and i was one of them. Staring at both iPad 2 and 3 side by side does not reveal the WOW factor to me that everyone has been talking about. What is obvious is that apps that are used on iPad 3 are much larger than the same apps for iPad 2 since these apps must have high definition imagery. So if an app is 20mb for iPad 2, the same app may be 80-100mb for iPad 3. If an app is 100mb for iPad 2, that app may be 400mb for iPad 3. If you're using a limited plan to download these apps, you may be running out of bandwidth sooner than you anticipated, and if you only bought an iPad 3 16GB like I did, it may only take a day to run out of storage space. 16gb was definitely not enough. The iPad line now needs an SD slot more than ever.- Processor - improvement is negligible and not felt over iPad 2- Ram - improvement is negligible and not felt during multitasking- Storage - it's the same storage for the same price, but more limited due to an increase in app size to support the high definition screen. You run out of storage faster than before. Charging the same price for limited storage is also a big NO. Apple should have already made 32GB the norm and included an SD slot.- Screen - improvement is obvious especially in reading and text rendering, but to some it's a drawback since it increases app size- NO Sd card slot to increase storage is truly disappointing. This is my main problem with the iPad line, and with the 3rd iPad it got even worse.-  Great 9 to 10 hour battery life- iPad 3 is thicker and heavier than iPad 2 - again a drawback- iPad 3 also has a warmer corner than iPad 2, not that big a deal, but an annoying featureFor me all of these factors caused me to return the iPad 3 within a week, but since I needed a tablet for textbook use, web reading, and my partner was already annoyed at me using his iPad 2 all the time, I walked into a GameStop and picked up a used 64gb iPad 2 plus 3G for $499 and 2 free iTunes gift cards totaling $100. The same price as an iPad 3 16gb. That was a much better deal in my mind than the iPad 3.The iPad 3 is not worth the hype, and since it under-delivers in almost every category but for the screen and 4G, I do not recommend its purchase. If you own an iPad 2, wait for the 4th to come out. If you're purchasing a new tablet, I'd consider the iPad 2 for $399 16gb or a used one with larger capacity for a cheaper price. Or the nexus 16gb for $249. Just remember iPad 2 has no Siri, dictation or other advances present in the iPad 3 due to apple's choice to only include the latest features with the latest iPad.  My jailbroken iPad 2 does Siri and dictation as well as an iPhone 4S and iPad 3. All in all I'm happy with my decision. 64GB of storage is fantastic.If iPad 4 comes with an SD slot, I'll definitely be looking to upgrade in the next year, if not my iPad 2 will be standing with me for the foreseeable future.Make the decision that best works for you.Good luck!", "Date": "August 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very disappointed", "Author": "sam", "ReviewID": "R2ZHC4O6M76E31", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought my new ipad through apple.com.

The iPad is not one of these things, but it is still a very nice piece of hardware / software.  The problem with the iPad is the same thing that makes it incredibly useful:  It can connect to and integrate so many disparate services into a single interface, and controls me.  My work email, contacts, and calendar with my Gmail one, as well as any other account I configure.  That's pretty slick, and I can't say I've ever seen anything be able to do that before, on Windows or Linux.  The dark side of all this is that \"It KNOWS!\" ..... as it has now become a sentient being.  But, this isn't that dissimilar from Google, or any other service you use that tries to integrate all the aspects of your life and/or workflow.  Do I wish that all this data could be stored in such a way where the only person that has access to it is me?  Absolutely.  Do I understand the reality that I'm not going to get this kind of integration unless I give up my privacy and/or anonymity?  Yep.  Would I also be for any other alternative that comes up that can protect my privacy and rights more than it can when using iPad, Google, etc.?  Certainly.The reason I got an iPad is essentially because I knew it would \"just work\".  While I can't say that this has been completely true, it has been mostly true.  As a knowledgeable tech guy, I've been wowed again and again by what this device can do, with relatively little effort on my part.Gripes:- There is no Adobe Flash.  I don't give two flying fish about your business politics;  I want Flash, because so much of the web depends on it.  You can take your stinky business model and send it down a dark alley.- No streaming Amazon video. (EDIT:  Amazon released their iPad app on 2012-08-02, so this is no longer a gripe)I'm able to find apps (and am willing to pay some amount for good ones) that do what I want them to, and do it well.  SSH, RDP, VNC, SFTP, FTPS, FTP, and other acronyms.  That makes the iPad very useful to me, and I can subdue the rage that brews inside about these other things.  I think that it's possible that the iPad could be just as useful to me (if not more) and *not* do (at least some of the evil things) that it does.Steve Jobs was a visionary, and so was Bill Gates.  They both ripped off their ideas from other companies, and proceeded to market them better.  That's kind of the idea behind open source...  except with open source you give credit where credit is due.  So, I'd like to thank Xerox and IBM for the iPad that I've purchased.

Long story short is that I absolutely love the Ipad for everything it can do, BUT, there were two reasons why I ultimately returned it:1. Connections:  I still really find it annoying that the only connection you have to this Ipad is the normal connection as seen on every single previous version of the Ipad.  Look, I know there is that adapter that you can buy separately that connects a USB cord to the Ipad as well as the SD card as well:[...]But, the general public that has bought the item specifically for the Ipad 3 are consistently complaining that it is very shotty and doesn't really work.2. THE BIG ONE!!!:  Itunes and the TERRIBLE interface when trying to sync photos from your computer (either PC or Mac ... and for me specifically a PC with Windows 7, 64bit), to the Ipad 3.  Not, Ipad 2, I'm taking about the Ipad 3.  Why is nobody complaining about this HUGE problem on this site?  If you don't believe me, just type in \"Ipad 3 Photo Syncing Problem\" on Google, and be amazed.  If you want to save the time, click on the below link which will take you directly to the blog as discussed on Apple's own community website.[...]Just start from that page and read on through 23 other pages, of complaints with this issue.  Some people offered solutions, some worked, but the bottom line is is that Apple continues to deny this problem, and there has been no recent fix/update with Itunes to remedy it.  Even though Itunes update 10.6.1 says:About iTunes 10.6.1iTunes 10.6.1 provides a number of improvements, including:* Fixes several issues that may cause iTunes to unexpectedly quit while playing videos, changing artwork size in Grid view, and syncing photos to devices.So, all in all, once Apple fixes this issue, I will not get the Ipad 3 again.  People reading this, please post your comments if you are experiencing the same annoyance that I experienced.

I was hoping to use my iPad 2 for 2 years and get the iPad 4. I decided to try the newest android tablet the Samsung note 10.1. I experienced many issues on it and in the end I missed the usability, reliability and apps of my iPad 2. I decided to get the iPad 3 and am very happy with it so far. It is more expensive and has less features than the Samsung note 10.  But it is still the best tablet on the market hands down. The iPad is really easy to use, has a huge app market for tablets, good support, good build quality, lots of accessories, retina display and air play.  When I first read about the iPad 3's retina display I thought it was a gimmick. After owning and using it I do see the difference with the screen. Since I spend a huge amount of time on my iPad 3 (mostly reading) it makes sense to get a better screen. They say it's suppose to be better on your eyes even if you have bad eye sleight. I also see the difference when watching videos or viewing pictures. In terms of speed I don't really notice the difference from my iPad 2. The extra ram is probably the main thing I've benefited from by getting the iPad 3. I do wish apple would improve the speakers on the iPad by making them stereo and not down facing. That's once thing I miss from the Samsung note 10. The samsung note 10 also had the ability to do real multitasking not the seudo stuff apple does. The note 10 could also run apps simultaneously side by side. These are things apple could do to improve their tablet even more. Although the iPad 3 is only slightly heavier and thicker than the iPad 2, I still notice the difference. I know that apple had to put a larger battery to power the higher resolution screen, LTE and processor.  I just think its unlike apple to release a product that is heavier, thicker and offers less battery life than it's predecessor. I haven't updated to iOS 6 yet as I heard it slows down the device, gets rid of YouTube/google maps and wifi issues. I am waiting for an update and also a jailbreak for ios 6. I am looking forward to Siri for the iPad 3, browser enhancements, email enhancements and Facebook integration. In the end apple won me over with air play since I own 2 apple tv 2's. No other tablet or mobile device anything like air play or as easy to use as AirPlay.Early November 2012 update: Well Apple screwed us iPad 3 owners by releasing a new iPad just 6 months after this one. The iPad 4 has a faster A6X chip, dual channel bonding wifi, a hd front camera and lightning connector. The new chip is suppose to make the iPad 4 twice as fast as the iPad 3. The dual channel bonding will make wifi connectivity twice as fast when connected to a n network support router. The lightning connector is suppose to charge the ipad 4 about 45 minutes quicker than the previous version. Personally I wanted an iPad that was thinner, lighter, had more ram and stereo speakers. Do yourself a favor dont buy the Ipad 4. Wait for the iPAd 5 which will most probably be thinner, lighter, stereo speakers and more ram and look like the ipad mini. In my case I was within 3 weeks. The apple store let me return mine for a full refund. I came home and placed an order for a iPad 3 refurb. I got my refurb wifi 64gb for only $550. Which is a great deal. I really dont know why Apple couldnt have waited a few more months for a newer version. Who knows maybe Apple will release a new iPAd in march or april again. The only reason to get an ipad 4 is if you do alot of gaming, photo editing or video editing otherwise your not really going to notice the difference or be worth your while.

Waiting until a new version of iPad is released seemed like a good idea, but I decided to go for it and buy the New iPad anyways. No regrets: it is not bulkier than my older ipad 1, and even though I do feel the warmth on its back and wish it was not there, the high resolution screen makes up for it and would probably compensate for more problems if there were more ones.The iPad definitely has the niche of its own: as small as MacBook Air 11 is, it is not the same.

I was definitely going to order one of those. I had ABSOLUTELY no intention of even considering an iPad. I have always had Android in my phones and wasn't about to change now.As I played with these two tablets, I noticed the pros/cons as stated by reviewers. My complaint with the Galaxy was the bit of lag, especially in the browser... but it was doable. The Prime just flat out disappointed me with it's non-bright display. I thought that someone put the display settings down but it was on high. I tried another one thinking that maybe this was defective and I got the same dark(er) screen. Also had the same lag time. Was also scared about the wi-fi issues I had heard about. And wi-fi is the main reason I am purchasing a tablet.For the hell of it I looked at the iPad 3 since it was right next to these. I immediately saw a huge difference in resolution. The more I studied it the more I was blown away. I went back and forth comparing the text resolution to the other two and there is NO comparison. The text on the iPad 3 is just crystal clear and as sharp as can be. You can even see the difference between the iPad3 & iPad2. While looking at small text I had to zoom in a little to read it with the Androids but with the Ipad 3 I could leave it at it's smallest text and read it easily.Also there was NO lag at all in the browser. It flowed smoothly with no hiccups or lags. After seeing this I went back to the Galaxy and now I can realllly notice the lag. Scrolling through web pages it was choppy and hesitant (in comparison).When pinching the pages, it would jump a bit and go down a few lines. With the IPad 3, no jumping at all. Pinching was extremely smooth and perfect. I have been converted!!Yes, I would love to have the Android personilization, but better graphics and smoothness are more important to me. The other tablets just can't compare in this department. I am a convert.Note - Give careful consideration as to the storage size you need. I was going to get the 16GB model and although I do not do many games, I was concerned about running out of space. If the iPad allowed you to use an SD card, then the 16GB would have been my choice; but I stepped up to the 32GB model to play it safe. Currently I have only a few games and about 4 apps. I have NO photos or music on here yet and already I have taken up almost 4GB of space. Obviously pre-installed material contributed to this but I would recommend that you consider the size carefully.

Other people have provided more extensive reviews, but I wanted to give my two cents on the new Retina Display.Photos definitely look more crisp on the new iPad.  In particular, areas of photos that include fine detail are noticeably cleaner and sharper.  As Apple advertises, if you look closely at, say, someone with a white shirt in a photo on the iPad 2 you can actually see the display pixels, which obviously limits the sharpness of the photo.  If you look at the same white shirt on the new iPad you cannot see the pixels; you just see a smooth area of pure white shirt.I think the difference between the new iPad and the iPad 2 is most dramatic when you view print, whether in a browser article or in an electronic book.  On the new iPad the boundary between fonts and the white page background is much, much cleaner and sharper.  This will make the new iPad much better for reading, with sharper fonts and less eye strain.", "Date": "May 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great at what it is intended to do.", "Author": "Brad Gordon", "ReviewID": "R1CC1J3FRCNN9X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you like reading books, watching TV shows or Movies, and playing games, then this device is perfect. However, the Ipad was never intended for serious office work or as a portable storage device, so be informed up front, this tool will not replace your laptop or even your netbook due to its limitations.That said, I have used it to display PowerPoint presentations and to do light office work. But when it comes to editing or performing actual day-to-day work related tasks, this device is simply not capable of performing much (if any of them) without jumping through tons of hoops for every new project.This shouldn't matter if you use this tablet for it's intended function: to entertain you.PROS: The construction is second to none. Processor speed is excellent. Huge library of Apps. Long battery life. And fairly simple to use. The speaker is also pretty decent.CONS: It can be a pain to upload files. ITunes is the worst program I've ever used. The back is way too smooth to get a grip on (basically, you NEED a case/cover to actually hold onto this device with any sense of security). Accuracy with a stylus isn't that great; only the most talented artists are capable of using this as a drawing tablet and your handwriting will never look worse than it does on this device.Even with the amount of cons, I can't stop using this tablet when I'm away from the computer.And depending on where you live, a wifi version should be sufficient when out and about. I've rarely had difficulty finding a hot spot at any destination I've travelled to.", "Date": "May 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "First time iPad buyer, excellent device on all counts.", "Author": "Nick", "ReviewID": "R1NO8BPY3AQ8GH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I decided to consolidate my digital life from my 3DS, Android Tablet and a few other gadgets into the new iPad. I ended up selling all that other stuff to pay for the $499 iPad that I bought at Best Buy. I'm typically an Android guy as I own the Droid Bionic and have only used Android phones since the original Droid. The only experience I had with iOS was with a second generation iPod touch I bought 3 to 4 years back that I enjoyed.My experience with the new iPad has been very positive. The battery life is fantastic, the screen is so enjoyable to read news articles and watch TV shows through Netflix and other streaming software. I've had two tablets before the iPad (Galaxy Tab and HP Touchpad) and iPad is the only device I've actually wanted to watch HD shows on. In almost all cases, anything I watched on my iPad seemed just as sharp and colorful as my HDTV and much sharper than my laptop screen. Top it off the device is quiet with no mechanical fans running in the background so your watching experience is really luxury stuff. I would note the external speaker is nothing special and that any type of TV or movie watching should be accompanied by a nice set of comfy headphones.iOS in many ways doesn't seem all that different at the core from when I had my 2nd gen iPod touch. It seems Apple has taken a more evolutionary approach to iOS while Google has tried to take giant leaps in user interface design. (Ice Cream Sandwich). In many ways however this has boded well for Apple. the A5X processor (pretty much the same as an A5 just optimized for  retina) tears through the menus with elegance and smoothness unlike anything in the market. That type of smoothness in transitions creates an experience where you stop caring about the clockspeeds and dual cores and ram and just concentrate on what you're doing which eases my techy brain into a calm state.I wanted to also note that the heating \"problem\" people seem to have doesnt' bother me. I rarely heats up and when it does it's just a tad warm nothing more. I recently put it in leather-ish case for protection reasons that seems to have reduced the heat on my hands as well. The battery charge time isn't a big deal to me because I charge my devices overnight and the slight change in heft is laughable as my last tablet (HP Touchpad) was a blimp in comparison.Ultimately to sum it up, the screen has made this device superior in many ways to almost every device I have in my apartment. It's THE screen to use when watching video and reading and it's super sharp and clear. The software support on iOS is the best of the best and the slick transitions make this a great device for almost anybody wants a great computing device when in bed, on the couch or on the go.

The aviation apps available these days are simply amazing. I no longer have to carry a big case full of charts and approach plates. It's all available on my iPad. Plus the location of my airplane is shown right on the chart or approach plate in real time. I can get 15 minute old weather including radar and satellite showing right on the chart. And with the 4G active I get updates in the air as long as I'm not in the mountains too far from a cell tower on the ground. The FAA and airlines have been crazy careful about passengers using cell phones in airliners. I can use my cell connection on my iPad for real time updates while in the air. For aviation usage the iPad is wonderful.That said, I use the iPad at home for reading the NY Times and responding to email. I have a Logitech bluetooth keyboard/cover that perfectly integrates with the iPad. I also use the iPad for displaying textbooks in the Amazon Kindle app. I can use the iPad for a laptop replacement for domestic pleasure trips. But for international travel the iPad is not very useful. For business trips there's no real replacement for a laptop when you need to use PowerPoint to make presentations or work with large spreadsheets or documents. The iPad is for light duty only. And it has no video connection for attaching a projector. HDMI is available using an adapter. But it's not well integrated. I see folks using an iPad for reading a book on an international flight or watching a movie. But a Kindle is much better suited for book reading on long flights. And bigger Android phones work perfectly well for watching movies. Taking an iPad on an international trip where it's a major target for thefts is really not the best idea.This iPad is the best option for what I use it for - aviation. So I can highly recommend getting an iPad for aviation. Make sure you get a WiFi 4G model. The WiFi only models do not have built in GPS.  I've tried the few apps available for aviation on Android. But they are much less capable than the iPad versions and there is really only one app choice - Garmin :Pilot. If you're in the Apple world and need a tablet then the iPad is a logical choice. But if you're in the Android world and don't need aviation apps, then the Galaxy Note 8.0 or the Galaxy Tab Pros are very good tablet choices.", "Date": "March 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good, Great, Wonderful !

I can hear their CFO saying: 'another sucker we took money from with an obsolete product sold as if it was the top of the line'. I expect better of the companies I buy expensive hardware from, that if they know what is going to happen just start discounting the current - but soon to be obsolete product -  so the CUSTOMERS would stay loyal.

I even incentivized and told them if they helped I would re-purchase another one from them but\u2026crickets.I purchased another one but I wouldn't recommend this seller.

The Kindle worked well enough for many of the reasons I bought it (and I absolutely love it as a book reader) but not for everything business-wise.I researched and read reviews for the iPad itself and the apps that I would need before I finally took the plunge and purchased it.  I chose the most memory with WiFi and Cellular coverage because it is primarily a business tool for me.  I need the memory for photos and videos and the cellular coverage so that I can access files and contracts.  It's important to me that I can conduct a complete real estate transaction wherever my clients or I happen to be.Even if you are purchasing primarily as a personal device, you may still want the 64GB version if you store a lot of music as well as photos / video.One of the things I was not able to get conclusive info on before I purchased was whether or not I would have to activate cellular coverage immediately.  The answer is no.  You can do it whenever you want.  I chose to wait until my next billing cycle started just because it was easier to read the bill without the pro-rations.I was a little hesitant about buying it from Amazon instead of from Apple or my phone carrier, but that turned out to be a misplaced concern. As pretty much always, it arrived on time in good condition.

This is substantial in weight compared to the Kindle, but not so heavy that it's annoying. It can slip into a tote purse easily.I highly suggest getting a protective cover for it. I have the magnetic one from the Apple store which is nice for the front, but does nothing for the back.  So be careful when carrying it around or maybe check out the Targus cover.DH has the Kindle which is a good size for him just reading \"books\" and he has the Targus cover which is so nice.Back to iPad - it's my first and I love the display - it's gorgeous. Fingerprints do show up, so I got the cleaning kit from the Apple store to keep it looking nice (solution and cloth).I simply use this for browsing or reading in bed and I love how you can size and resize the text instantly by pinching open or closed and moving down/up the page quickly.Get a stylus. We have the Targus which is like a little pen with a small \"balloon\" on the end for tapping/selecting. I wish the stylus was a bit more pointy or small, because sometimes I have to resize the text before using the stylus for selecting. If I had to use a finger all the time, I'd be resizing a lot more.This is not a toy for little children (obviously), as the price is up there and if dropped, oops.  We did get the protection plan, but haven't had to use it.Haven't used Facetime, but if more of the family gets with iPad, then it will be wonderful for staying in touch.This is our first Apple purchase and I'm impressed at the ease of usage.

I always wondered why there was so much hype surrounding Apple products. It's a beautiful tablet, both the body and the screen. I just thought Apple would've shaken things up a bit instead of using the same mundane icon layout etc. The good thing is that it gets the work done that I need, the extras that I want are just not there. For example, no auto-fill when typing URL's, lack of Flash player, no built in HDMI port, no notepad for me to write on unlike the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 and the so-so sound quality. I've gotta tell ya, the Kindle HD sounds way better. There are some other features I wish the iPad had, but I won't get into that.What I'll say is that I like the sturdiness. It feels like they used good quality material to construct this. Battery life is simply amazing, I rarely need to charge it. It connects quickly to the internet. I like the sharp retina display, the ease of transitioning from one app or website to another. It's very smooth, the best I've seen in any tablet and I've purchased and returned a few in my quest to find a really good one (Kindle Fire HD, Blackberry Playbook, Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 & the Asus Transformer TF700T). I think Apple got me by the sheer volume of apps they have and so many of them are free! It's amazing to have such a vast array of apps that are dedicated to this one product.I like it enough to keep it plus I'm tired of returning tablets. I'll just have to learn how to manipulate it.

The backspace \"key\" is the only way to move the cursor and it erases characters. The touch screen allows you to place the cursor where you want it, but it isn't always responsive to my attempts to place the cursor where I want it; so this too can be awkward for making corrections etc. I ordered a stylus.

With this issue however, there are apps you can get which will allow for texting to other devices. They aren't quite as simple to use(just a few more steps) but I'm sure that is by design.

It is my first iPad. I do own an iPhone 4S, and I did briefly purchase an iPad2 back toward the end of January. However, I took it back because I expected that the display would equal to that of my iPhone4, but it was not. I heard there would be a new one coming out in the spring, so I returned my iPad2 within one week of purchasing it. I only played with it a day or two, and so glad I did return it. The new iPad was more than well worth the wait! :)Words simply cannot describe just how intense the screen resolution is, and how vibrant the colors are. Simply SPECTACULAR!! Stunning! The speed is excellent, the photos are crisp and clear, and if someone has a small piece of fuzz on their hair, for example, it will clearly be seen in their photo, as was such with one photo that I took! :)I own a white 16GB Wi-Fi only version.There are a few issues that I have experienced, however, and also read on the Apple Support Forum that others are also experiencing. I also took my new iPad to my local Apple Store yesterday to ask some questions.First, the new iPads heat up. This is due to the new and larger battery. I was told at the Apple Store that this is nothing to be concerned about. Some, although not myself, claim that their new iPads are actually too hot to touch. I have not experienced that. Mine does get extremely warm, but, nowhere near too hot too tiuch. So, you may want to beware of that, and purchase a Smart Cover to fold and hold your iPad with. (It's a good idea to have one to protect your screen, also! :))I have also experienced issues with iTunes, and read others have, too. ITunes simply \"kicked me out\" when I tried to look at movie information, not even trying to download a movie. It kicked me out and returned to the home screen. It did this several times. Tried the re-boot, but still kicked me out. Others have reported problems with downloading content from iTunes, as well. I don't know why this is happening. I heard that one possibility could be that with so many new iPad users, all trying to sync and download, that it is causing these issues. Or, it could be a glitch that will need to be corrected by Apple. Just don't know. I'm not worried about it though, because I feel confident that it will be resolved in one way or another.The battery seems to drain pretty quickly. Especially for me because I crank my screen up to maximum brightness. :) And, so far, my new iPad takes an INCREDIBLY long time to charge. I was told at the Apple Store to be sure to let the battery run all the way down before charging, and that after a few times doing that, this will improve. Time will tell! I've read others also are experiencing this issue. I bought a 6 foot charger at the Apple Store yesterday so that I can plug in and charge, and still use while charging it. I found out that it is completely safe to use the new iPad (or any iProduct) while charging, so, that is very helpful to me.I am in love with my new iPad, and am VERY, VERY happy with it. I recommend to all. :) It is truly incredible, and better than I ever imagined it would be. :)", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "The problem with Apple products is Apple service!", "Author": "Jacob Cox Jr. \"ACC Solder\"", "ReviewID": "R2WHQW0CZO8HYT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The problem with Apple products is the absolute abismal customer care for their products.

By the way, if you call Apple with your cell phone, make sure you plug it into your charger. Otherwise, you will need to go find it around 1 hour and 10 minutes.

I'm petty. On the other hand, the assumed eventual availability of OnLive cloud gaming was one of the major reasons I invested in the tablet with the highest resolution on the market.

I loved the original iPad and have used it for productivity and fun.I decided to wait for the 3rd generation iPad and am glad I did.  It sports a 5 megapixal camera and video camera capability with the beautiful retina display (which I have on my iPhone 4).  The design and curves are the same as the 2nd generation iPad, so iPad 2 cases should fit this iPad without a hitch.  I purchased the rooCASE Convertible Premium Leather (Red) Case Cover with 24 Angle Adjustable Stand for Apple iPad 2 / iPad 3 / The new iPad and it's been a nice protector although I am a fan of the Otterbox iPad 2 Defender Case - Black.Overall, if you are a fan of iPad (or Apple in general) and have the iPad first Generation, you will notice a nice change.  If you have the iPad 2 and were thinking of upgrading to the latest model ... you may want to just hold off.  The differences are in the chip and the camera quality and display.  Depending on how you use your iPad (power user like me or casual user), that will help you to judge.I think the switch from first Generation to third Generation iPad is definitely a great and worthy leap.  I would question the switch from 2nd Gen to 3rd Gen if you are just a casual user.  Truth is, from the outside ... you won't really know the difference.

Brunner", "ReviewID": "RIX6U3CS4S65U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "5 Stars For The New IPad! 1 Star For Best Buy's Lousy Customer Service!I  have both the IPad 2 and the IPad 3. There are differences between the devices, but the two devices share many similar qualities as well. If you have not bought an IPad, I highly recommend it. I have the wifi plus Internet on both of my two devices. I also have a steel case made by Logitech that is a Bluetooth keyboard. With this keyboard the IPad 2 completely took over for both my MacBook Pro (2011 model) and my dell.So, there are many things that are the same about the IPad 2 and the IPad 3. They look identical next to each other. They are the same size. They both fit my Logitech keyboard which is also a snug case. When turned off, the two devices are indistinguishable. Also, the apps seem to work on both although some of my apps seem to be a little off. For example, on WeRule the buildings have earnings that you need to click on to collect. On the new IPad, you have to click to the side of the buildings, and the picture seems to have trouble loading. Hopefully, the apps will update soon fixing these issues. The features on the two IPads really seem the same.There are a few differences that I can see on the two devices as soon as you power them up. First of all, the picture on the new IPad is very crisp. There are more details. It is hard to explain the difference. I only really see it when I put the two screens next to each other. When you put them side by side, the difference is striking. The movies and graphics look much clearer and impressive. Another difference is in the speed of the devices. I can see that the new IPad is faster. It runs certain apps faster like Plants vs Zombies. It loads apps faster than the IPad 2. Again, this is a very small difference only seen with the two together. The camera does take a better picture on the new IPad 3 than the IPad 2, but it is nowhere near what I would be happy with. I do not use either one for this except to FaceTime, and I do not see me changing that with the new IPad 3. My IPhone 4s has a camera that far exceeds the IPad 2 or IPad 3. If you do not have an IPhone, I am sure that you could find a much better camera for less than a hundred dollars. I plan to test it out more, but my first look did not impress me at all. The pictures were fuzzy. The new Internet does seem faster on the new IPad 3 as well. I have 3G on the IPad 2 and 4G on the IPad 3. In my area, the only Internet is 3G, but I swear the new IPad is faster. The Internet just seems faster.Honestly, I bought a new IPad 3 only because we wanted another one for my husband. I'm not sure if there are enough differences to say that I would get rid of my IPad 2. I was very pleased with the IPad 2 that I bought at Best Buy with their protection plan. I also bought my IPad 3 at Best Buy with the protection plan. It was $135, and it covers accidents as well. It covers if you crack the screen which I like alot. The people at Best Buy activated my 4G for me, and they were extremely helpful.Edited 3-20-12- a couple additional thoughts- the voice dictation is a feature that I'm not very impressed with. It is a good idea, but I would rather just type with my keyboard rather than have to go back and correct mistakes. The battery does not last as long as my IPad 2. I am using the new one exactly the way I have used the old one for the last year. The difference is about an hour less battery with the IPad 3 because of the improved display I guess. Another thing that I recently noticed is that the new IPad 3 weighs a little more. I only notice this after reading for a few hours on it. I started getting tired of holding it which I never did on my IPad 2. Also, I noticed that I have to slow down my typing on the touch screen on the IPad 3. I got pretty used to a fast pace typing on my IPad 2. The same pace on the IPad 3 leaves out letters. I only mention this because it happens quite a bit. I slowed down my speed, and the problem went away. Sometimes the autocorrect catches it, but other times it doesn't.Edited again 3-27-12 I just found out that Best Buy totally screwed me over when I bought my New IPad from them. The day that I bought my IPad; I was told by three Best Buy sales employees that I had to activate my New IPad in the store through them. In fact, I was taken out of my line to pay, which would have taken 5 minutes and put in a line that made me wait for an additional 30 minutes. I asked the employees if I had to activate it there since that was not the case with my IPad 2. I was told that I could not activate it on the IPad itself. Come to find out that this is a big lie/ scam cooked up by Verzon and Best Buy. If you activate your New IPad at Best Buy, you are set up with a post paid plan. There are people saying that Best Buy gets a kickback from Verizon to screw you over in this way. It is similar to a cell phone plan except that you do not have a contract. Well, why am I griping??With a pre paid plan that you set up directly on your New IPad, you can:1. You pre pay. So if I only want one month then I can pay for that one month and that's it. If I want another month, it is fine. If I do not, it is fine. On a post paid account, you do not have a choice. You are billed for each month and if you go over your data you get charged overage fees and if you leave and come back you get activation fees.2. On a pre pay plan set up directly on your IPad, you do not have any activation fees. If Best Buy activates your IPad, you have a 35.00 dollar activation fee. You also have this fee if you do not wish to have Internet for a month or two. You come back, and Verizon charges you another activation fee.3. On a pre pay plan you can access your account directly from the IPad. If Best Buy activates your IPad, you can only access your account through the Verizon website ( which is a total nightmare) or by calling their customer service ( which is another nightmare) trust me on this. I have been dealing with them all night.4. On a pre pay plan you have the choice of 1g of data for 20.00 dollars a month. If Best Buy activates your New IPad, you only have 2g for 30.00 or 5g for 50.00. This is what I was told by 2 Verizon customer service agents tonight.One good thing that I found out about my New IPad was the personal hotspot. I don't know why I never saw this before today. Oh, it is because if you activate your New IPad at Best Buy, the personal hotspot is not in your general settings menu until you turn it on. I think you go to general then network then turn on personal hotspot. This is really cool. You can then use your iPad's Internet as WiFi for other devices. We tried it with our IPad 2(worked beautifully) iPhone( worked beautifully). Because of this feature, I changed my opinion. I would upgrade from an IPad 2 to the New IPad. Just please do not let the people at Best Buy activate it. I am a Best Buy silver reward zone member, so please do not think that I am a Best Buy hater. This is the first time I have ever had an experience like this with Best Buy, but I will not trust that store ever again.", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Returning It :\\", "Author": "sampson", "ReviewID": "RL6HR7T9CQTB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought the newest ipad over the weekend and will be returning it in a few daysThe retina display is overrated.

Playing a video or audio file in one window or tab?  Don't look at anything else!  As soon as you do, 99% of the time your playback or whatever stops.  And, if you switch back, the very idea that it might hold onto that data seems to be a foreign concept.  Download a 200 meg PDF file, read thirty or forty pages, then check your email.  Coming back to that tab leads to your iPad basically saying, \"Oh, you weren't done with that?  Well, we'll just have to re-download the whole thing from scratch!  And, even though it would be incredibly simple for me to do it, I didn't bother to remember where you were at.\"Flash, Java, and JavaScript. \"Why would you want to play anything like that?  Stephen Christ did not approve of such heresy!!  Therefore, you do not, either.  Therefore, you have no need to see them, use them, or have me acknowledge their existence on websites.  I shall block them out and make popup windows of large, empty frames to protect you from their sinful natures.  Praise Steve!!\"And before anybody replies and says that you can eat apps that will run flash movies, yes, those do exist.  However, either you have to pay a monthly subscription fee for them or you have to become the software equivalent of an AMWAY distributor to keep using them.Wi-Fi vs cell connection.  I purposely bought the model of iPad that had a cell connection, and, unlike a number of other reviewers, I haven't yet had any trouble with that cell connection and I do like the navigation software, but, given that Wi-Fi is generally free and cellular data generally costs money, wouldn't it be somewhat reasonable to default to using the Wi-Fi if there's a connection available?  Or have a place where I can set a preferred order to access these things in?  Oh, not in Blessed Saint Steve's world!  I have to turn my cell connection completely off anytime I'm using wi-fi, or it'll just keep pulling data over the cell.This damn touch keyboard.  Enough has been said about that in other places, but let me assure you, it's true.Keeping the screen clean.  If you're using programs that require you to input a lot of stuff or you're typing a lot, be prepared to clean your screen off every twenty to thirty minutes.  I just use a paper towel that I always have sitting by my iPad, so that's not too bad.  It's still an annoyance, though.Finally, how reflective this screen is.  Working against a white background isn't bad, but if the background is darker?  Well, looking straight into the iPad screen is like standing eighteen inches away from a mirror and trying to watch a t.v. program being shown on the glass.  Maybe this is supposed to be some kind of symbol that Blessed Saint Steve, Hope For All Mankind. Is watching over us, I don't know.  What I do know is it's annoying as hell.I could go on, but I think I've made my point.I'm just hoping that, when my financial situation improves to be able to replace this embarrassment to progress, I'll be able to borrow a hunting rifle from a friend of mine, and, with five or six rounds, put this iPad out of my misery.Who knows?

Yeah, Apple already has them at premium price, but usually it's worth it.  However, Apple doesn't price gouge even when there is huge demand.  Why does Amazon feel they need to add to the already high price?  It's not like they put any technology into them.  Obviously it's to make more money from us, the loyal customer.  If you saw an 32 GB iPad 4 priced at $690 in a store you'd walk out and go into an Apple store and get it for $90 cheaper.  You could also get it online from Apple for the true price.  Also, why is the white iPad cheaper than the black iPad?  They're the exact same product, just different color.  Oh, more people want the black one, so Amazon is going to profit more from that.

I thought having a windows tablet would make lot of sense to me. But after 3 years still there are no windows tablet and windows 8 is planed to be released by end of 2012. And there will be host of tablet makers good/bad/ugly onces in the market and trying to find the best one is difficult. So that means another 1.5 years of wait.Meanwhile, about 8 months back I purchased asus transformer 1st gen. It kept me happy for sometime, but latter I was less than happy with its performance. With the death of asus transformer tablet that I own, it was no brainer to buy the 3rd gen iPad.The iPad does what it is advertised to do, it is a giant iPod touch, but the larger screen is always better.The tablet is all nice and good, the apps, the performance the acceleration, the retina display etc.BUT the display calibration is bad. I have iPhone 4 and now iPad 3. iPhone 4 has much better color reproduction quality than iPad. The white on iPad looks pale white instead of pleasant white on iPhone.If the display is not able to reproduce the white properly then there is no way (IMO) it will be able to reproduce other colors properly.I have attached an image showing the difference between iPhone 4 and iPad3 display.EDIT1: I am doing a battery cycle test, i.e. charge to the maximum, discharge till it shuts off. Then recharge back to 100%. It took about 6-7 hrs to discharge the battery completely mostly reading books and surfing and few 1-2 min youtube video.And it is taken me 6 hrs to charge from 20% to 85%, I did not track when I put it charge at 0% so it has actually taken much longer to come to 85%. It is not a good deal with the batter, right? The battery discharges way faster than recharging. I am using the adapter and cable provided by the iPad 3. The battery recharging capability is less than satisfactory to me.Edit2: I upped my rating by one star because I am more than happy with the performance of the device.

Is it being fazed out, yes, but not for a long time. The lack of Flash hurts a lot of the websites I have tried to go to.Next, their new maps support. These maps are terrible. Why kick the company to the curb that has already done all the work, put all the money needed into it, and is proven itself. Why? Apple has gotten a big head again, and believes that whatever it makes it just has to be better.Touch sensitivity: I used my friends iPad 2 for awhile after he upgraded to the iPad 3. He told me I had to try the new version. The touch sensitivity seems to be off. It does not have the response of the iPad 2, Samsung Tab, or even a Kindle I used to have.Retina display failure: I see no difference between the iPad 2 and the new iPad. If you are looking at upgrading to the new one for its display don't. There is nothing special about it. It is just a numbers game.Must use iTunes: iTunes is one of the main reasons I will never own an Apple product. This software is awful. I cannot believe they have not made it easier to use. If you want to buy all your stuff through apple then yes, oh yes they make it easier. But what if you are not brain wasted by apple and you want to use Amazon to get your music for a better price? Not so easy to get it on the iPad. The software is a joke.No support for other video formats. This device unlike all its competitors has said no to supporting standardized formats. If you are buying this device and wanting to transfer your current videos to it, don't. It will only support the apple format.Your apple ID: This is nearly the worst part of the iPad itself. You cannot do anything on the iPad without this ID. It is terrible, and if you forget your security questions you will need a crack team that can get into Fort Knox to get back in. Why are these questions so important? Well it took me over a month to help my mother fully get back into her apple ID because if you upgrade to a new apple product and you do not know those questions? Good Luck! You may never get back in. And if you have spent a lot of money in iTunes it could be lost. BEWARE: write down your security questions.So much for ease of use. I have had in the past year family come up saying with a big smile I just got the iPad. I tell them good luck with that. They go off and \"play\" with it for awhile. Then they come back and ask how to you download apps, how do you transfer music, how can you put DVD's I already own on it, how can I view this website it says flash not installed, and the list goes on. It took only about a month for one family member to ask me what is this good for then?I then smiled.I stand by my word.
