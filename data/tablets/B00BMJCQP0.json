Everytime I read the reviews I would change my mind about the ematic and look at other products. They didn't have the same apps like the ematic funtab, so I decided to search for the ematic again. Since I buy every thing from Amazon I kept comimg back to see if the ever got any in and they did. It was the second versions. I preferred this version because it has a front and back camera, even though my grandsons are only 4 & 5 they enjoy taking pictures and making videos of their self. The 4.3 screen is perfect for them.I learned a long time ago that you can't go by other people's opinions. You have to take a chance, and try it for your self. l took a chance on the the ematic funtab and was very pleased. I brought this tablet for my grandsons but I couldn't stop playing it myself after setting it up. Now my boys are boys, they are hard on toys, so I purchased the extented warranty. So far they have dropped them and threw them a dozen times and they are still working. I am very satisfied with my  purchase of the ematic and so are my grandsons now I have to purchase two  more for my granddaughters. I may even purchase the 9inch for me.", "Date": "July 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "terrible", "Author": "Librarychick1970", "ReviewID": "R3SFEZS8SE6ANL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This tablet quit working for my 5 year old on the day she got it.

The parental controls weren't very easy to use, nor did they keep my son from bypassing them and browsing on his own.  It was a pain to figure out how to download the Amazon App Store (my preference) and every time I wanted to use it, I had to reinstall.  It comes pre-loaded with a ton of games he wasn't interested in - I ended up deleting them all.  The best part was that it was very easy for him to download his own apps once connected to wifi.  Sometimes it was a little slow for my taste, but he enjoyed it.  It was testy to get the charger to connect sometimes, though it does use the same charger as my Droid and Samsung smartphones.  That was helpful for long car rides!!It is broken now (less than 1 year later) because the piece that the charger connects to has broken off inside of the thing and I can't figure out how to get it open.I'd recommend this for medium use for smaller kids; but I think 6-7 years old may be about the limit, if they are anything like my child who likes to download and delete all the time.", "Date": "October 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "WARNING: BAD PRODUCT", "Author": "Dena Thomas", "ReviewID": "R3UW7CVXCT7TTC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought 5 of these for my children for Christmas 2012. Every one of them broke within a week. The charging ports are bad on them. I sent them back to the company who repaired them, but it took 4 months to get them back. They broke again. I was able to get my money back from Wal-mart for 2 of them which was nice because I purchased a warranty for those. However, I sent my daughter's back to the maker in February 2013 and didn't get it back until July!!! Then it broke again within a week-the charging port again, and they refused to fix it. Another problem with it is if your child is old enough to figure out a birth date year that makes him older than 10 years old, the parental controls will not work. Then they have free access to explicit internet material. My kids are definitely smart enough to figure that one out so this is not a kid safe device.Another huge frustration is the touch screen doesn't work well. There have been times I haven't been able to return to the settings because it was at the bottom of the screen where it wouldn't allow me to touch. HUGE, HUGE, HUGE FRUSTRATION!! I just about wanted to flush the thing. I have also had these to just not boot. It just sits there on the loading screen for days. I sent that one back for this problem, too, which was another 4 month wait for a repaired one. I will never buy an Ematic product again!! My recommendation is to buy an old working ipod touch (whatever generation you budget can buy) on ebay, download free apps and set parental controls. It is MUCH better, safer and cheaper! This is what we did and I wish I would have done this for Christmas last year!!

I have to agree, on the first look the USB charging input has to be handle gently...not for a 4 years old.  The tablet can discharge within hours while unused.  There is not power management applets installed, install one.  I have installed \"Easy battery saver\"=> mostly 1,5 to 1,7x the normal play time.- Give proper rules to your kids; play while sitting comfortably, put it away to the charging station as soon as your finish, parents should activate the limited playing time feature (they have to return after a while, do not toss it away (buttons are exposed and could be broken).- Put on a screen shield- The rugginess could be overestimated.  The protection is better than normal tablet, but not as strong as the Nabi for example.In the kid mode, some games won't work unless you pay for them because they are sending publicity which is blocked by ZoodleFor the price of a console, you get unlimited free games for your kids and if you activate the Zoodle account, you will get all the review you need for almost every games available to google market, which is a good tool for concerned parents.", "Date": "May 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Worse purchase ever", "Author": "Darla Davis", "ReviewID": "R2GLZZL78JJHLP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We bought 2 of these for our girls at Christmas they lasted less than a week.

Let me get this straight, they were going to replace it before it came with the cracked screen right?

He was 18 months during the holidays and took to the \"ANT SMASH\" app/down load immediately, along with his mother's tutelage, he was learning and doing fun activities in a very short time. After using it for all of 4-6 weeks, My daughter called , telling me it won't hold a charge. After way to many, phone calls, jumping through hoops. no resolution, coupon, exchange, or percentage off on another.  Amazon(distributor) and Disney( maker of product)  have given me is pitiful excuses. ultimately, I did purchase the product in September. I have a voice for my grandson something should be said.  First, it's a God awful shame this has happened to my grandson or any child that received a defective Disney Fun Tab Mini, any defective toy, ever.( made for children under a certain and over a certain price, I say $50.00)  We don't have that type of money and for us and many others , there are certain times of the year to make \"big purchases on a budget\"  We were all truly  amazed with this toy/product and could see the potential of this gift for children so young. I trusted both of these companies for many other purchases and vacation stays. Secondly, Disney put out this product with this defect or defects, Amazon sold it, and neither accepts the responsibility. I do understand the time frame situation, but the truth is the truth, \" You can see in your record also that the purchase was made, it was given to a child for Christmas and before the first week of February is was not taking a charge at all.\" Third, most important, Disney and Amazon put this out for CHILDREN and left parents and grandparents to have to explain that we, brought products that are now broken and they can't play with anymore. In my case I couldn't even word an explanation to a 1 1/2 year old child, he just can't play  Ant Smasher anymore. Ironic, that these big companies are always \"Smashing\" the working class. My grandson's birthday is in June do I buy him another tablet? I will most likely replace it because of the concept.  Clearly not a Disney product ever or a purchase from Amazon ever again, Disney/Amazon big money makers duping the CHILDREN.
