Young", "ReviewID": "R2AFF3T31DXVP6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Okay, first of all I have read through about 10 customer reviews of this new iPad 3rd Gen. I must say that I am very impressed at some of these \"editorial like reviews\". Well after all of the technical stuff, I'd like to just keep it plain and simple.I never owned an iPad before last week. I was always saying that Apple was overrated and actually they're not. I have owned all kinds of \"other\" cellphones, smartphone and tablets. Well, last month I finally brokedown and purchased an iPhone 4S and now this cool looking iPad 3rd gen 32GB. I will just say that it makes my Samsung Galaxy Tab look pretty lame and boring. I had ordered mine online and could not wait for it to arrive earlier this week. Well anyway, I opened it up registered it on iTunes and began to sync it to my account. Well after that I began to mess around with everything and had so much fun doing so, that I didn't go to bed until really late. I was impressed that it was fully charged up when I turned it on for the first time. The graphics are second to nothing elso out. I purchased some Beats by Dre Studio headphones so I could listen to music and movies in quiet places. I love everything about the new iPad...I really don't even need a regular desktop anymore. I have considered buying an iMac desktop maybe later on down the road. I heard that some people complained about the iPad getting hotter than normal on one side, well mine has not so far, I assume Apple fixed the problem with that.Now, on the flip-side of the coin, I must say this new iPad is really heavy and dense like, I am turned off from that aspect, especially since a lot of reviews say the iPad 2 is much lighter, why is this one so heavy!? Secondly, I think this model should have an sD card reader and at least one USB 2.0 port. Lastly, I think they should have added Siri to this new iPad since she's such a hit with the iPhone 4S.Well hopefully this review is pretty simple to absorb and can be really helpful to someone. All and all, I really enjoy my \"new iPad\", but the last things I mentioned above is the reason why I gave it an 8/10 or equally 4/5 stars rating.**Forgot to mention**, iTunes is really cool and now they have the iCloud feature. So what ever you decide to download it will automatically appear in other Apple devices that you have registered. I currently own 2 other devices and it's nice not to have to download everything via the computer, with iCloud it's already there.**UPDATE**  9/22/12 A few days ago, I was able to update my iPad 3rd Generation to iOS 6 (so this means \"Ms. Siri\" is now available on this generation of iPads). I said thank you, they have answered our prayers. One strange thing that happens when you update your operating system is the YouTube App disappears...IDK what that's about.", "Date": "July 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Horrible Device For Basic Business Needs!  Too many restrictions!", "Author": "J.

Don't be fooled by the slick design & nice screen display, this device has so many limitations compared to other cheaper devices.I think it's good for an entertainment device but it's horrible for business. Here's why....The iPad does not allow a basic way to attach a file to an email.The iPad does not allow a way to upload any content through a web browser. Example, if you wanted to upload your current resume to a career site, there is no way for iPad to do so.  You would have to use your computer or an android device.I'm shocked in 2012 with a hi tech device I'm unable to do the most basic everyday functions.I tested out some cheaper android tablets & they all seem to do the basic internet functions with no problem; even the Kindle Fire!?. Email attachment, upload & download files through the web browser.  All web content is not hosted through iTunes so the restrictions is a big headache.

It's a toss up, the apple \"may\" go.", "Author": "DC \"David Ceremuga\"", "ReviewID": "R3NHLQDQS267E6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've been using an Acer A400 for about a year, and to be honest, with the firmware and software updates it has become a very stable and fun tablet.  It does absolutely everything I need.  I love having the built in full size USB port, MicroSD card and true dolby stereo speakers.  So you are probably asking, why did you buy an Ipad then.I wanted to check out some new technology and I already know Apple makes some great products for graphic/audio and Education.  Well I like the interface and ability to truly close out programs.  But you know what?  The Apple bogs down when truly multitasking.  The android puts apps in a suspended state, so you can have dozens of apps open.  Android \"claims\" it is ok, but the performance does start to hurt.  The iPad simply gets hot and bogs down if you do the same things.The iPad has a better and more solid feel, it is a snappier interface, but it is locked down.  The Android is semi-locked down, but easy to change.  You don't have to have a face full of icons.If I had to start over again, I wouldn't buy either at this date and time.  I honestly  believe that there are some very good products based on Windows 8 and later versions of Android that will hit the market in Q3.  This will be a game changer as far as functionality and usefulness of a tablet.My advice.  Put your credit card back in your wallet unless you have an immediate need for a tablet.  Don't fall for either an Android or iPad at this particular time.  They are all over priced and the limitations are frustrating.  Go take a walk and think about the fact that you can save the money for a much more advanced generation of tablet about to hit the market 3 to 6 months down the road.I rate this a HOLD.", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "DO NOT BUY THE VERIZON IPAD", "Author": "Mary Lou Cochrane", "ReviewID": "R2LHWV8IIGYJYA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I haven't had any problems with my iPad EXCEPT for deactivating my VERIZON account.  This product is advertised as allowing you to sign-up for service one month, drop the service when you don't need it, and then reactivate the service when you want it again.  DON'T BELIEVE IT!I used the Verizon service for one month, deactivated and received the message that my sim card is associated with another account or is no longer supported.  When I updated to the new IOS 6, the sim card was magically reactivated (!) and I could use the service again.  I signed up for a month's service again and at the end of that month's service, I deactivated and received the same non-service alert.All Apple forums on this problem have the same complaints.  Consumers need a new sim card and are hassled at the Verizon store to change service.  As far as I am concerned, this is false advertising so I have filed a complaint with the FCC as recommended in the Apple forum.  I am waiting for a call from Verizon before proceeding with replacing the sim card.  If I need to constantly replace a sim card then that should be stated in the advertising.The reason I purchased the new iPad was to be able to use it and pay for ONLY the months I WANTED and NEEDED, not for what Verizon wanted to sell me.  I am extremely disappointed with both Verizon for the service and Apple for allowing this to happen.  This is not how this product is promoted by both companies.If you want the new iPad, maybe you should try AT&T; instead of Verizon - maybe they have better service - maybe not!

This is the only obvious *external* difference between a 4th generation iPad and earlier models!  The other differences, like the \"Retina Display\", resolution of cameras, and speed of the CPU, are less obvious.  There are no markings on the outside of the box that would let you tell the difference between third and fourth generation iPads (e.g. no \"third generation\" or \"Retina Display\").If you have an iPad, the best way to tell which one you have is by looking at the model number displayed by the iPad software under Settings --> General.  Or look up the model number, written on the (physcial) back of your iPad, at [...] (Amazon won't let me include the URL, but a google search on \"Identifying iPad models - Support - Apple\" will turn it up as the first entry at Apple support.)Anyway, here's my story:I tried to order this product, a 4th generation iPad (with Retina display) from two different sellers, but received 3rd generation iPads both times.  I'm giving this one star because of the ordering problems, not the product (I hope that folks are more likely to read this if I put it down as a negative review rather than a positive one).The fist seller, \"IMG Direct\", sent me an obviously used 3rd generation iPad in the box of a 4th generation iPad.  The order was fulfilled by Amazon.  Amazingly, Amazon took the blame for this as a \"packaging error\" and voided my 2 star rating for the IMG Direct on the grounds that it was Amazon's fault(!).  I strongly suspect it was IMG Direct that supplied Amazon with the re-marked product.The second seller, \"Wirelessnow\", sent me a new 3rd generation iPad with the box relabelled to appear to be a 4th generation iPad.  At least it was a *new* 3rd generation iPad! (I'm planning to upload a picture of the remarked box.)I'm going to make my third attempt to order a 4th generation iPad, but this time the order will be direct with Apple!Looking through the reviews of a number of sellers, including \"IMG Direct\" and \"Wirelessnow\", i see a pattern where customers complain that they were shipped the wrong item and give a 1 star review.  Amazon then apologizes for the mistake and voids the review (the review remains readable but the 1 star score doesn't seem to count against the seller's rating!).This behavior is not limited to my two sellers -- its true of some other sellers as well!I'm going to speculate that Amazon actually pays the seller the ~$600 price for the mis-labelled item based on their \"failure to fulfill it properly\", so that this is a win-win situation for the seller.If the customer doesn't notice they've been shipped a cheaper product, the seller pockets the profits.  If the seller does notice and complains, Amazon takes the blame as a \"fulfillment error\" and gives the seller most or all of the original list price.If my speculation is correct and you're a seller, this is great!  Its a win-win situation.  Either the customer misses the substitution and you collect $100 or $200 more than the shipped product is worth, or the customer catches the substitution and Amazon takes the blame -- and you're still laughing all the way to the bank!  But I don't see why Amazon wouldn't wise up to the scam!Just my $0.02 -- YMMV (Your Milage May Vary).", "Date": "November 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Screen / Slow Charging", "Author": "Glenn R. Howes", "ReviewID": "R9GHM1VDIAW18", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As an iOS developer, I've owned all 3 generations of iPads. I also own a couple other tablets: a Kindle Fire and an HP Touchpad, so I have some perspective about usability.  In terms of general usability in the most situations, an iPad is the way to go, it has the most and best tablet apps, and the best hardware. This release took the solid base of the iPad 2, and added the best screen I have ever seen, a very nice camera and real 4G networking. This review is about whether you should switch from an iPad 2 or possibly even buy the still available iPad 2.First, the negatives. The new screen with 4x the pixels, the 4 core GPU to draw into it, the LTE radio, all three conspired to make Apple put in a much bigger battery, making it heavier--yes you can actually feel the difference--and longer to charge. Because Apple uses an extension of USB to charge at 2.1 Amps, which is unchanged from previous editions, it took me 5 hours 57 minutes to go from 0% to 100% charged using the Apple provided charger, compared to 4 hours 14 minutes with last year's model. As a consequence of using more energy in the same 10+ hour usage, the device can get mildly warmer.While the front facing FaceTime camera is unchanged in quality, it's still dismal especially in low light, you know the kind of light you're likely to have when you are inside thinking about video chatting over Wi-Fi.Because developers will need to replace their bitmap graphics with additional copies that are 4 times the resolution, a Retina display updated app could potentially be 5x larger in the worst case, although that would be unusual. Still, apps will take up more room. This isn't an advantage over the iPad 2, as the iPad 2 will be laden with the same bulked up apps, with no advantage given.Now, on with the positives.Great screen. Really you have to see text on this thing. It's like you are typing into a laser printer. Not only that, but better color reproduction. I did a side by side comparison with my iPad 2, watching a synced up copy of Puss n Boots, the iTunes 1080p copy and the older device had a bit of too much orange in it, just a bit which you wouldn't likely notice without the side by side but glaringly obvious if you did. And 1080p content is spectacular on this display where all 2.1 megapixels can be shown without scaling down.I purchased the Verizon LTE model. This has the advantage that Verizon is allowing personal hotspot tethering, while AT&T; is not. I've had tethering on my iPhone and when I've needed it, such as taking my family on vacation with a laptop, the Fire, an iPod Touch and an iPad 2, it's been a Godsend in a Wi-Fi scarce world.  The LTE is zippy fast when you can get it, unfortunately that doesn't include my house, where it drops down to Verizon's inferior CDMA network, which is noticeably slower than AT&T;'s GSM network, but I wasn't going to use it from my house.  Put it this way, an iTunes 1080p movie is 2GB max; Verizon charges you $30 for the first 2GB. If you still have an AT&T; unlimited plan from your iPad 2, I think you can move it to a new AT&T; model, but be careful.This release reputedly comes with double the RAM at 1GB which mainly shows up in the much larger number of tabs you can quickly switch between in Safari, a nice sweetener.The backfacing isight camera is about the specs of the one in the iPhone 4S, excepting being 5 instead of 8 megapixels, which is fantastic, excepting the part about using a 10 inch tablet to take pictures or shoot video. Why couldn't they have put this camera on the front?\"Audio to text about comes with this release this is a bit hit or miss and you might be lucky to have a clear and constant voice which allows you to text at your text\". As you can see, it doesn't like my voice, but it is a potentially cool feature.So, in the end, I think choosing this over an iPad 2 comes down to whether you love clean text and demand the most beautiful video. If you need faster charging times and want to save money stay with the 2. Next year there will be a new new iPad, with a faster processor, a more efficient LTE chipset, Siri, a decent front facing camera, and whatever else they can think of to part you with your money,", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Who's Ipad is it????", "Author": "IronmanFX", "ReviewID": "R2GIWZQB7E66J1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered my Ipad on July 25th of 2012. I received it shortly thereafter. A few weeks later I called Verizon for a data plan which they did provide. When the first bill came from Verizon there was a $904.13 equipment charge. After several calls and many hours on the phone Verizon tells me the serial number of the Ipad I bought from Tech Giant, fulfilled by Amazon is (wait for it...) STOLEN. I offer to provide Verizon with my proof of purchase from Amazon and Verizon says it doesn't matter. Verizon says I bought a stolen Ipad so I am responsible to Verizon for payment (904.13) after I have already paid Amazon $864.00 for the Ipad. I contacted Amazon about it and all they say is they are sorry and let them know if they can be of further assistance. HELLO I contacted you for assistance. Did you help me when I wasn't looking?

While loyal Apple fans or people who want to use the basic apps but appreciate its design you'll likely give it a 5-star.  So I had to go with the 4-star to be fair.Where the iPad 3 shines:- Gorgeous screen; not much complaint here as watching HD movies including Netflix and YouTube video is amazing- Thin & lightweight; for its size, it's not too big of a hassle to carry around- Beautiful design overall; Apple pretty much set a standard for today's tablets and they still keep simplicity in a beautiful design- Simple; you don't need to know how to use Apple products, great for kids and adults that aren't exactly tech savvy- Amazing battery life; I could play Minecraft for hours and don't eat up batteries like other tablets do- Very responsive; for the most part depending on the app.  Rarely freezes (yes, it still does freeze from time to time) and is fast enough to run any HD games and apps.Where iPad 3 doesn't impress:- No flash.  Flash enabled sites either need a flash compatible browser if not you cannot view the content.- No GPS for the Wifi version; this would annoy you if you're looking to use it for navigation (you'll need separate GPS module made by another company that cost at least $100)- Slow charging; with the wall charger it comes, it does charge very slow.  The only negative side of the longer lasting tablet- Keyboard is not intuitive; difficult to type in landscape mode, no swype or other after-market keyboard like Android has- Expensive; for the money you'd think you'll get more out of the unit- Screen size icons; for the massive screen, you don't have a way to cram more icons forcing you to either create folders within or use multiple screens.- Many apps that are free on Android market often times are not free on Apple Stores.- Proprietary plugs; when will Apple learn?  No HDMI, mini-USB, etc.I personally recommend the iPad Wifi version for:- General entertainment for games, movies and news reading + where Wifi is available- Children; easy to navigate and use- Don't care about GPS navigation or use it for related purpose- Are not tech savvy or don't mind not having flash options- Want something simple and reliable- Want long battery lifeI don't recommend the iPad Wifi version if you:- Want to use this in the car, boat or wherever you need a GPS for navigation and plotting- Want to do any sort of modification including custom ROM's- Need flexibility in terms of the O/S- Are looking for cost savings and best bang for your moneyPersonally I'm more of an Android guy than Apple guy but it doesn't mean Apple's products are bad either.  It's one beautiful tablet I've ever played around with (it's my wife's) and aside from it not having GPS and other features available on Android, it's a solid performer.On a personal note, if they come out with a 7\" tablet I wouldn't mind owning one.  Especially if it had GPS even on the Wifi version I'd buy one in a heartbeat.  To me, the pro's outweigh the con's for the iPad 3.  For as long as I can remember I've been a PC-guy where I didn't care for Apple but ever since iPod's came out, they've really changed the computer industry.You won't regret your purchase either way.

Ard", "ReviewID": "R2PSRD71G1I2XN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As my title says I'm an Android man, this is my first iOS device. There probably isn't much to be said that hasn't already been covered by more experienced users, so I'll be brief. I bought this with the idea to use it for a few months and then give it to my wife who's been asking for one for awhile. I was planning to get an Asus Transformer for myself. Having used this for a month so far, I now find myself on the fence...while I love the customizable features of android (usually root my devices and load custom ROMS), the ease of use and final polish of this pad is phenomenal. I like the screen, the size and I think I might actually prefer the 4:3 screen ratio to the widescreen of the asus, as it means less scrolling when browsing the web in landscape mode.Ultimately, the new iPad is undeniably a 5 star device regardless what we of the Android community spew against it. So if you like iOS, or want THE tablet all other tablets are judged by, you should probably buy this one. As for me, I'll continue hemming and hawing, for the next couple months while I use this iPad (much to my wife's distress) while I continue trying to decide if I really want to abandon my beloved android.***Update***So my wife and I have been using it consistently for about 2 months now, and my main aggravation with the iPad is simply that there is no native file management system in place. Example: I want to create a text file with my passwords on it. However, I don't want any person that comes along to open the notes app, see my file and be able to open it. I prefer to be able to \"bury\" it in a hidden folder somewhere within the operating system. I would also like the option to easily rename files, and organize my Pictures, Music and personal documents in my own folders, i.e. a \"My Documents\" folder. I debated dropping a star on the iPad for this inflexibility in the iOS, but I knew about this \"shortcoming\" (as least in my eyes) before buying it. I just didn't realize how heavily it would impact my day-to-day use. In the end, I will be buying myself an Android tablet while the wife will use the iPad.***Final Update***So I finally ended up purchasing an Asus TF300 for myself and have been using it for about a month. My reasons were mainly because I wanted the flexibility of a file management system and the ability to more thoroughly customize my home screens (i.e. widgets and such). While I'm happier with my Android tablet, I still think the iPad a 5 star device, while I'll probably give the Asus 4 1/2 stars. The build quality just can't compare, the retina screen on the iPad is beautiful, and the stability of the OS is rock solid. Of course, the price of the iPad is more steep, and it came with 1/2 the memory, but 16GB should be plenty for most users and anyone who isn't SURE they want the Android, would probably ultimately be happier with the iPad.

So over the course of years I always dismissed iPad because of it's price. I bought MANY Android Tablets and taking them back because I was disappointed with Issues. Here is a list:- Elocity A7 tablet- Samsung Galaxy Tab- Dell Streak 7- Archos (few of those)- HTC Flyer- Eee Pad Transformer- Xoom- Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1- Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0+Now all of them wasn't bad tablets, they just wasn't working properly after a while. So after all that I gave up on tablets period. I decided that since I have a now Android phone (Samsung Galaxy Note) It was time to just save and bite the bullet on a iPad....Now I question myself...Why did I wait so long to buy one?!?!This tablet is amazing, It truly a remarkable device. I can see why Apple get's praised for making a device this good and this fluent. While I understand both iOS and Android is different and each it's own (There are some things Android and iOS do better then one another.) but \"The New iPad\" is leaps and bounds over most tablets that I've tried here is why:Screen:Bright and Vibrant HD Visuals. It's crisp and sharp and reading on this thing is Phenomenal. This is eye candy (or iCandy) pure eye candy to anyone who is a fan of a HD display. Unlike the iPad 2 which I tried at the demo at store there is no way I can go back to a lower resolution tablet due to the fact I am spoiled by this screen. The games look amazing as well. Honestly its like the screen isn't there.Speed:Quick...So quick in everything it does. Web browsing is super fast, Opening apps is super fast, Doing anything is fast. I never owned a iPad 2 so I can't compare the two but I am very happy with it.Apps:Good apps are in the app store. Almost anything your looking for its almost certain its in the app store and running perfectly if they are iPad ready. You won't be disappointed. Its one of the best ecosystems on a tablet device. This was my main reason for getting the iPad and I'm sure a lot of other people too. There wasn't a hassle like \"side loading\" like it was on my first tablet \"Elocity A7 tablet\" which lead to a terrible user experience for a first timer. The iPad simply just works and I can believe if this your first time having a tablet. You will be happy.iOS 5.1.1 / Camera:It improves on what was already one of the best mobile OS out there. Notification makes it a much more enjoyable experience. unlike it was before on the first iPad. The cam on this thing is so much better then it ever have been before 1080p looks clean and clear. Recording Video is nice! What bad about it is that it takes up SO MUCH STORAGE. I don't see myself using the camera at all to take pictures it's nice that it's there though. Let's face it, I don't think many people would want to use their tablet to take Pictures / Videos. I will just use the front facing cam for face time.Build Quality:Solid and it just feels right in the hand. Just don't drop this tablet at all. it seem like it would break pretty easily. I would get a screen protector like I did and a case to cover the iPad. I notice its a little heavier then the iPad 2 which might be a problem to some people.The bad:Well, The iPad can get warm at times on the back. It's also somewhat restrictive and limited. I would like to have an SD slot to add more storage / lack of customization that iOS such as widgets / and a little bit more open in the market. I can live without these but it would be nice for Apple to open up a little more. The price is expensive but worth it (especially for that screen alone) just little too much just for 16GB of space.Overall:I just want to point out that this Tablet is not for Android junkies, its just not. If your coming from an Android and that's all you've been using. I doubt you will be 100% happy especially if your so use to customizations. I suggest you guys wait for the Nexus Tablet from Google which I will be getting as well.But for people that just want a great user experience with a tablet without any hassle. Even if your a New comer to tablets, I suggest you get the New iPad. Its a little hard to say if you have an iPad 2 to feel the need to upgrade unless you want that drop dead gorgeous screen. But trust me it improves on what the iPad 2 before it had which was a good tablet from the start.It have the best ecosystem, it still has the \"just work\" aspect and it still one of the best tablets out there. Buy it, enjoy, and have fun!Edit:I took back the 16 GB and got myself a 32GB iPad and I love it to death! Personally I highly suggest getting the 32GB/64GB iPad. its just not enough storage with some Apps ranging to 1 GB+. Thanks to some research I also found out how to do home sharing on iTunes to save space. Still loving this product so far.", "Date": "July 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "I love it.", "Author": "Elizabeth", "ReviewID": "R2P05D14AT8VJA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had Apple products before, and I've been considering an iPad. I finally took the leap.Admittedly, when I first got it, it felt like a luxurious toy -- and perhaps it is. I kept saying to myself, \"my Macbook can do this\" or, \"Do I really need this app?\"But finally, what it boiled down to was that I was having so much fun with my new iPad. It was a mixture of both practical, functional apps and wonderfully fun apps. I concentrated on free apps and already have so many good ones downloaded. I have books and magazines to read, including audiobooks which can be read to me before I fall asleep, and apps to help me with things like finding yard sales in my neighborhood or Manga Storm, which is marvelous for reading manga on the iPad. There's Glympse, which lets everyone know where you are at any given moment.This may be the Wi-Fi version, but in my city it has its advantages. My ISP is providing free Wi-Fi hotspots for its customers around the city, and is adding more all the time. I imagine other ISPs will follow suit. Wi-Fi may soon be in competition with 3G and 4G. It sounds far-fetched, but at least in my city, it isn't, although a few years ago it would have been. So I can get connected in a lot more places for free, which is nice.I'm very impressed with everything about the iPad, from the display to the controls to the sound. I don't have an iPad 2 or an original iPad to compare it to, as this is my first one. All I can say is that I am very happy with mine.I got a beautiful case for it that I just love: the Osaki iCoat Slim Y+ Hard Case and Cover for The New iPad and the iPad 2. It fits both the new iPad and the iPad 2. What I love is that the front of the case is like a Smart Cover, except that it does both portrait and landscape modes. The front cover attaches not to your iPad, however: instead, it attaches to the back case. I also got a nifty little stand, the Arkon Portable Fold-Up Stand for Apple iPad, Galaxy Tab, BlackBerry Play Book. It works great in both portrait and landscape mode and is great for charging.I also want to say a word about screen brightness, since some people have mentioned about the iPad overheating. I was worried about this prior to getting mine. Yes, if you have a bare iPad and you run a game or a very graphic intensive app, the iPad may get a little warm. However I have found that most of the time, the brightness level that the iPad is set on, which is around 50%, is fine for me. There have been a few times when I have raised it to 75%, and there have also been a few times when I have lowered it to 25%. But mostly I keep it at 50%. I keep my Macbook's screen at 100% brightness. So I like a bright screen. But the 50% brightness on the iPad is really bright to me. The only exception is if there is a game and it has a really dark scene. Then maybe I want to turn up the brightness a bit, or maybe I want to dim the lights in the room. It depends on the game.However, most of the time, people are not going to have a bare iPad if they are thinking about protecting it against dropping it. Usually they will have AppleCare+ or some type of protection plan. Mine went right into my case as soon as I got the case. So with the case on it, I really do not feel any heat. The heat I was mentioning was when I was playing games on it when it was bare, before I got a case for it.Also, if you've never had an iPad, I learned from Apple tech support you can only have 11 pages of apps on the iPad (you can have unlimited apps stored on iTunes or in iCloud). But you can put apps in folders. So at least there is that option!All I can say is, if you've never had an iPad and you're on the fence, this is a beautiful device. I'm extremely happy with mine. The only thing I would wish for is more storage. I got the 64GB but it still feels like for things like photos, videos and movies that I would like more storage.The iPad third generation is amazing: you won't regret your purchase. I'm thrilled with mine.", "Date": "May 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good upgrade if you have an iPad 1 but not if you have an iPad 2", "Author": "Hoppaguy", "ReviewID": "R1TOQLTSMRPLM3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had both an iPad 1 and iPad 2 prior to purchasing the New iPad (iPad 3?). The iPad 1 is pretty much now obsolete because it is incredibly slow and crashes a lot with the newer apps. There is also no camera on the iPad 1. Therefore, if you are going to upgrade, you might as well upgrade to the iPad 3. Everything is better on the iPad 3 compared to the iPad 1 in terms of screen and speed.However if you currently own an iPad 2, I actually do not think upgrading to the iPad 3 is worth it. For one the iPad 2 and the New iPad look virtually identical. I even brought them both into an Apple Store and the guy that was helping could not tell the difference. You might think you can easily tell the difference with the retina display but you have to look very carefully to be able to tell. Don't get me wrong the retina display is beautiful but you have to look carefully to tell the difference. In terms of speed, I cannot tell the difference between the iPad 2 and iPad 3. The big difference I can tell is the camera in that the New iPad has a 5 megapixel camera.I am giving the New iPad a 4 star rating because it is a great device but in my opinion it is not worth upgrading if you already own an iPad 2.", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "It is so easy and works flawlessly!", "Author": "Learna21", "ReviewID": "R2TLI2GSKLCZGG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're not a technical person or want something that just works and is simple enough to set up, the iPad 3 is the way to go. iOS is set up with a very simple interface for people who just wants to get the job done and nothing else. I received the iPad 3 16GB (wifi only) model as a gift two months ago and it has been working flawlessly and I love it. I love Android devices too, however, I had a bad experience with the one I bought and I regretted not spending the extra $100 on the iPad earlier.Pros:I have had zero problems with the iPad. The display is very bright (but I usually keep it at a low setting). The whole device is built to feel very durable and responsive. My previous tablet, every time I tapped the screen, I felt like I had to be extra careful because it always felt like it was so delicate and would shatter. The battery life lasts for three days for me on average, even with a decent amount of game playing. It's easy to set up. Has a lot of accessories you could find for it with no problems everywhere.. even in a street stand in NYC. I also haven't had the problem where it heats up easily even with games.It is fast and the experience of using it is very smooth. It shuts off quickly, turns on quickly, loads apps quickly. I love the multi-touch gestures. I can switch between apps with no lags and no freezes.Cons:16GB should be sufficient, but sometimes I feel like these apps are huge and will deem this 16GB model as \"not standard\" anymore. In fact, three games I downloaded raged at the 500-550MB size. And since the storage isn't exactly 16GB, it leaves me with even less space. You could always use cloud storage for other files like photos and music, but you'd always have to have internet to access those files so try to leave the least used stuff in cloud storage.I'll also have to admit that the iPad does take a long time to charge. I think it took about 4 hours to charge, two days ago. Another con is that it's a bit heavy and a bit thicker. It's not very noticeable compared to the iPad 2, but for general use and holding it up to read, it does get tiring, so this might not be the device mainly for extensive reading with one hand.There's also no SD slot where you can expand memory, but then again, I realized many other tablet manufacturers stopped doing that also. I don't mind anyway as I feel like the SD slot would just ruin the design of the iPad.

Fun for face time, basic emails, watching YouTube videos or to play games but in reality it doesn't have enough computing power, memory or a functional keyboard to be useful as a mini-computer.EDIT: After Apple released the new IOS and it's subsequent update I have lowered my rating. NOT because the new IOS is bad but because of the stupid way it updates. Before you would update the IOS and the IOS only, now you have to completely wipe the IPAD's memory even for the littlest update (last one they added a Greek keyboard). That means you lose EVERYTHING on your IPad and you have to download it ALL again. That's right, every song, picture, app, data, video, magazine, kindle book, etc. etc. etc. But not before you have to input you Wi-Fi password (for every Wi-Fi account you use) and your apple account and password, not once but three times in order to even start using your IPad. For me to reprogram all of the passwords, restore all of the apps and re-download all of the data takes about 8 hours on a pretty high-speed connection of clicking on apps.

If you want to use it at an angle (e.g., while sitting in an armchair or lying on a sofa) - you still can kind of prop it on one hand (e.g., bottom edge on your palm and a few fingers behind it for a prop) - but your hand will start getting numb in just a few minutes (remember the weight!!!)- Sound: given its size, I didn't really expect it to have Bose quality, but still, it's rather more rattling than I care to listen to music with...- Battery: it never really gave \"...Up to 10 Hours of Battery Life...\", and with time it dies faster, and takes longer to recharge - now it only takes it ~2 hours to go from 100% to 8% (and it's been less than a month!!!)- Cord: power cord is extremely short (never seen something similar in my life!!!), so, if you want to use it while plugged in (remember the battery life?) you need an extension cord - with the bulgy adapter dangling just below your knees (when standing - figure out where it'll be when you're sitting or lying down) - It might be not a bad idea for a new product: \"belt clip for the iPad's extension cord\"...- I resent the idea of 'sandboxes' for applications, where each application can see only its own data and nothing else: e.g., if I have two applications capable of viewing PDF files, and I download/save a PDF with one application, I can't open it with the other; or if you have two 'file managers', each one's storage will be separate, so you have to remember which files are managed with which manager... And if you try to install a 'better file manager', moving your files from the old one is a nightmare (if you figure how at all)... Honestly, 'Jailbreak' seems almost a must... :-(- Applications: yes, applications are provided by different vendors; but there are some that come preinstalled - and some of them suck big time... (e.g., Safari, the web browser, etc. - but that's a separate big topic...)P.S.

I got the Wifi + Cellular model for AT&T; so I could have the internet anywhere and everywhere. I have used my iPad every single day and absolutely love it!I resisted getting an iPad for a long time because I could not see a need for one. I already had a MacBook Pro and an iPhone so what would I do with an iPad? It seemed to be a blown up version of the iPhone (without the phone part) and an inferior version of the MacBook Pro (without the keyboard or processing power). So what the heck would I do with this iPad thing?As it turns out, I do a lot with it! I will admit that I play games on it a lot, but I also use it as my main \"to go\" item. I have it synced with my MacBook Pro and iPhone so it always contains anything that I consider important and want to always take with me (emails, notes, calendars, documents of various kinds, etc). It's my entertainment if I'm ever stuck anywhere, having to wait on something (the apps are much better on the iPad than my iPhone). I keep track of the weather and my kids (AT&T;'s Family Map plan), and the rush hour traffic (which can be a mess in the Houston area). Maps are easier to read and follow with the larger screen than they were on my iPhone. Even reading books is better on the iPad than the iPhone. And, yet, it's easier to carry around than my MacBook Pro; plus, with the cellular contract, I always have the internet available to me at all times.So as it turns out, the iPad does have its place even though I have a MacBook Pro and an iPhone. They each have their specific purposes. Even though I waited years before finally buying my first iPad, I cannot imagine not having an iPad now. And I'm very pleased with the model I selected as it runs all the current software very well and should be able to keep up with whatever comes out in the future for a long time before it becomes so obsolete that I'll have to buy a newer version.

As a befuddled \"oldster\" (but I did know windows very well) they gave me plenty of time and effort. Some things are so simple if you only knew, and reading on the \"book\" manual in the iPad's ibooks (free) can only get you so far. The touch is so responsive it took time to \"power down\" my finger compared to \"other\" touch products (my other brand smart/dumb phone, kindle fire, other people's tablets, etc.)Things to know, = makes very sure you get that 90 days service, once the box has been opened the clock starts. If you buy someone else's or a \"open box\" from some store, make sure you know how much time is left.

Awesome, Awesome piece of technology and tool.Now for the long version.  I had an iPhone for two years before purchasing the iPad.  I had played around with my friends when the first one came out and thought it was a fun (expensive) toy great for surfing, playing music and games.When I got the chance to get one for myself finally, I honestly wasn't sure that I would use it.  I had been given the first gen Kindle Fire and thought the UI was s#@t!  Not to mention that the Android store was neutered and I wasn't able to download any app that I wanted because of the Amazon operating system that was on it.  So even after rooting the Kindle and installing the Android operating system I was even less thrilled about the tablet idea.  The touch technology between my iPhone and Kindle were significantly different.  That difference equated to annoyance when I couldn't get the Kindle to recognize the correct link I was trying to get without having to zoom in all the time.  The iPhone would figure out what letter I was picking on a page and get it right 98% of the time... unzoomed.  What I did like was the idea of being able to not have to have my laptop around all the time (which is 17inches of screen) and that I could use it as a reader.However, I didn't want to squander my work bonus on something that would sit on the kitchen counter next to the Kindle Fire because I had no use for it.  After researching what apps were available like iWorks, Flipbook,  Note Taker HD that would serve a utilitarian purpose for my job.  I went ahead and got the iPad.  I honestly can't remember being more stoked about Apple since my first experience on the Apple IIe as a kid learning basic and playing games.  This muthafkr goes EVERYWHERE with me now along with my iPhone in my back pocket LOL!!!The clarity, visual smoothness, quality of the metal... Steve and his team really out did themselves.  As a reader, there can occasionally be some glare as I've come across when reading outside.

I used Mac computers for nearly 20 years before switching to a PC. When I got my first smartphone, 4 years ago, it was an Android. I still use an Android global phone. So when it was time to try a tablet, I figured I should get the Samsung Galaxy Tab as it would be compatible with all my Android apps that I had spent a *lot* of time finding and testing. What I got was a 32GB model that was a complete flop. I was incredulous. How could my phone (Droid Incredible 2) work better, faster, and more smoothly than the Tab? So I kept if for a month or so, trying to tweak it in every way imaginable to make it work better.When I decided it just wasn't happening, I got an iPad 3rd gen. I was blown away by everything from the typing experience, the number of great accessories (typing this with a Zaggfolio keyboard case) and its incredibly smooth operation. It is so amazing that for the first time in 4 years I'm thinking about buying an iPhone next time around. What I notice is that you can simply enjoy the tablet, instead of killing times trying to make it work better. It just works perfectly to begin with. My only consideration now would have been to get at least the 32 GB model. Different than Android, apps for the iPad are much larger in size. A typical 2MB app on my android might be 20mb on the applie, making the memory evaporate pretty quickly. Still, I use it mostly for reading books and sending emails, or buying something on line, so I think the 16gb should suffice.Do yourself a favor and get this tablet.

I have been the proud parent of many tablets prior (Asus TF 300, Galaxy Tablets, etc) and nothing compares to the silkness of the ipad 3's OS, processor, and retina display. My Asus TF internal chip overheated and my galaxy tablets constantly froze, which frustrated me...As an average consumer who always looks for the most efficient way (money and quality wise) to purchase products, I did tons of research concerning the comparison of the ipad 3 and 4. I realized that shortly after the release of the ipad 4, the ipad 3 was discontinued from being produced and not even sold or offered in stores while the ipad 2 still was. This led me to assume that apple discontinued the ipad 3 in order to make more money selling the ipad 4, since people would just buy the ipad 3 instead since the ipad 4 would be priced a 100-150 more, just for a half-second speed boost over the ipad 3, while they both held the retina screen.So overall, i highly recommend the ipad 3 to the 4, as you can even buy a used ipad 3 for 250. if you want a half-second boost in speed and bragging rights to say \"i have the newest ipad\", go ahead with the 4.

The battery life was over-promised from the beginning and only got worse over time.

I bring it to class instead of my heavy computer, which, trust me, makes a huge difference when you are also carrying a lot of books. There are many uses of the Ipad 3 in a schooling aspect, and also some restrictions. I'll go into both in this review.I will start with the positives of the Ipad 3. First off, it is super lightweight. So if you are interested in carrying it a lot of places, it is a good option. It is small so it can fit in most bags or purses. I wouldn't write an essay on it, but when I need to look something up really quick in class or on campus, I have the option to. It is also good for taking quick notes on, or having something saved so you can show your professor.Something else that is really good about the Ipad 3 (which also goes for all apple products) is the choices of apps. I am taking a French class, which has an online textbook. However it uses Java, which most Ipad internet apps do not support. Through lots of questions and research, our teacher found out that there is an app that supports java. So now I can also access my french book from my iPad using \"Puffin\" internet browser. Other than that, safari and other internet apps are very useful, fast, and easy to use.The iPad 3 has a \"mail\" app that is used for your email. It will load the email straight to your iPad, so you can use the app instead of having to log in online. The best thing about this app is that you can load multiple emails to the app, so you can see all of your emails in one place. This might sound overwhelming, but you can sort them in a specific way. Say you have three emails linked to it, and you only want to see the new emails for two of them, you can select and unselect what email shows the unread messages. Something else that is good for school is \"math reference\" app.I am so glad I have the Ipad 3 because when I was in math class, and lost in the lecture, I could just open up math reference with my Ipad and get a quick answer. There are many helpful apps on the Ipad 3 that you can use for school, and a lot of them you can get for free, or for really cheap. One comes already on the Ipad 3, which is called \"iTunes U\". This is an app where you can download and save specifically education material. Such as books, courses, and educational videos. More and more now textbooks for certain courses are coming out with the \"kindle edition\" of their books. Which means if you have the Ipad, you can buy your textbook as a Kindle book and read it in the kindle app. This would make the books astronomically cheaper and of course, be much more convenient because they would all be in one place in a nice, lightweight iPad 3.The iPad 3 makes it very easy to change settings if necessary. All of the apps are easy to move around into the organization that you desire. They are easy to download, or delete. You can easily manipulate almost every aspect to your Ipad from the \"settings\" app. It is very clear, concise, and easy to use. Even for the technologically challenge. And even if you don't know how to fix something, you can just look it up online. There are tons of forums and Q&A; websites for apple products. There are also a lot of great shortcuts on the iPad 3 to get around easy. For example, the very left page is a search page. If you double click the home button a bar at the bottom shows up with your most previously visited pages. If the iPad is on lock, if you double click the home button, some options will appear for listening to music (if you already have music playing). If you click and hold the home button, you will have access to \"Siri\". If you click the home button and lock button at the same time, it will take a screenshot.Now for the negatives of the iPad 3. I have very little things to complain about with this product, but of course there are always a few inconveniences. One would be that sometimes the internet stops working. Most of the time it is just my campus internet failing, but sometimes its my iPad. Most of the time, just turning it off and back on will fix it right up. Very, very rarely my iPad will be slow or have apps quit unexpectedly on me. But again, this is very rare.Overall, the Ipad 3 was a great purchase. I use it everyday. I am still looking for my class books to be kindle editions so I can just download them to my iPad. I am sure more will start having kindle editions soon. It is such a great thing to have for my schooling, it is incredible how many things you can do on it to help your education.", "Date": "February 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "I really love my iPad", "Author": "Uriel Galimidi", "ReviewID": "R3P51MYSFQ7LOG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I use my iPhone for news video clip, reading books and documents, and surfing the web.

Wireless devices aren't useful if you are constantly wandering around, trying to find a signal.Some inherent problems with touchscreen devices also afflict the iPad. When typing, moving the cursor to a specific position in the text to make changes is clumsy and annoying. It is almost always quicker to just hold the delete key.

The Ipad fits in her purse and is so practical.No one should think this is a replacement for a laptop - it's not, but it is great for email, browsing the web, and streaming.  She also loves the camera to take pics of grandkids.  It's only 5mp, but still looks good.  Being able to add apps is another thing she loves.Well made and extremely easy to use.

Personally, I will not be using the iPad to take pictures as I laugh at people who use their tablets to take pictures, they look ridiculous.Good feel and size - I'm one of the rare few that likes their items to have a good weight to them because it proves that they have value to them, like pick up a Walmart watch then a Michael Kors watch and you'll know what I'm talking aboutDictation - It's nice and accurate, old technology, nothing to see here folks.Elegant looks - Of course it looks breathtaking compared to any tablet out there, it is sleek and simple.Cons:Still no smaller model, this is not a personal concern but yeah for all the whiners out thereStill no headphones - is it that hard to include them apple? Come on...A5X processor - You would think being a 1gb dual core with quad core graphics processor that it would blow the A5 out of the water? It actually got a point lower than the iPad 2 ( 720 vs 721) disappointing.To sum it up really, if you have an iPad 2, do not upgrade, if you have the original PLEASE do.

Hinton", "ReviewID": "R2IKLSS535J07U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The reason I decided to write anything here at all is the listed price of the 32Gb model.Wow just wow....  $629 for a $600 item.... Apple iPad MC706LL/A (32GB, Wi-Fi, Black) Price: $629.08 & this item ships for FREE with Super Saver Shipping.I guess Amazon has now come full circle charging more than MSRP for an item that is readily available everywhere for MSRP or lower.Even at the the Apple Store (iPad with Wi-Fi 32GB - Black 3rd generation $599.00 In Stock Free Shipping).What a deal for unsuspecting Amazon shoppers.Since I am here I may as well put some very random thoughts about the machine into the user reviews.We had an iPad2 (16Gb wifi) for about a month, it was bought so my wife could take it on a trip. Since we did not know if she would really like a tablet or not we went with the lowest price model.  Well as it turns out her fingers became permanently glued to the device. The iPad3 came out very shortly after we had bought the iPad2 so we sold the iPad2 to a family member and bought a iPad3 (wifi 64Gb) model.Other than my Galaxy II phone I/we have no other experience with tablets or smart phones.  I have used the iPad a little and the phone a lot.I am pretty middle of the road when it comes to the iOS / Android battle. Each has good points and bad points.  I think the Android will always suffer some of the same type issues as Windows due to the multitude of hardware configurations it is deployed on.The one thing I was greatly concerned about with the iPad was the lack of Flash support, but as it turns out the only website I have noticed the lack of Flash being a problem is here at Amazon.In the music section the Amazon music preview player is Flash based so I cannot listen to the sample clips when browsing CDs.  I am sure there are plenty of other sites that will give errors but we don't visit them so we are not greatly affected by the Flash 'issue'.Of course if the websites you like are Flash driven this will be a major issue you should consider before buying this machine.As far as I can tell the best trick the iPad3 has over the competition is the retina display; the text on the new iPad is considerably sharper than the iPad2 (big deal for me, not so much for my wife) and only a couple of the premium Android tablets are in this fight.Any tablet I decide to get for myself has to have text that is on par with what the retina display produces.  So my list of tablets is pretty short.When it comes to the rest of the hardware the review sites give the A5 processor a slight edge over the Tegra 3 processor, but for my use I am confident either processor is more than adequate.If you like action games I would specifically seek out performance reviews of the particular game you want to play before committing to any specific machine.The iPad3's cameras do a really good job for Facetime and video recording. Picture taking is somewhat lacking and from the reviews I have read this is a common knock I see on all the embedded cameras on phones and tablets. The 8mp camera in my Galaxy SII does not take as good of pictures as my old 4mp Kodak camera so I have good reason to believe the negative reviews of the cameras on the various tablets are accurate.The one thing I really don't understand is Apple's omission of some variety of SD slot (and on a top of the line machine in 2012 it needs to be a SDXC slot) on the iPad.Even the 64Gb model is really limited on storage space if you want to put a music library on it.  I don't even think my music collection is all that big and I have over 60Gb in high quality MP3 files.If the iPad had a SDXC slot I would not hesitate to buy one for myself. As it is if one of the premium Android machines adds it in the next refresh that will probably tip the scale for me to go that route simply for the storage capability.Build quality is outstanding on the iPad3, not sure what more could be asked for.The native apps that Apple has particularly right are Facetime and the music player.Even though I am unsure about the whole iTunes thingy (my wife has it on her computer, but I don't have it on mine) once the music is loaded on the machine it is functionally the best music player I have ever used.Facetime simply works; too bad it is a closed system for Apple only (the rest of my family that I would like to do video chat with use some variety of iPhone, iPad, iTouch, iMac). I have used Skype and it has done the job, but it does not work as good as the Facetime.Since the listed price of this machine is what prompted me to write anything I might as well comment on the price vs the competition, if you want to compare a budget Android tablet to the iPad3 there is nothing anyone can say that will affect you. Apple does not compete in the budget machine market.But if you do a more direct comparison of top of the line machines there is not really that much price difference (yeah I know $100 is $100 but $600 for a ASUS TF700T 64Gb model vs $700 for iPad3 64Gb model seems pretty close to me when any head to head review by an unbiased source gives the overall winning nod to the iPad).", "Date": "October 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Author": "OLE LADY MEL", "ReviewID": "R2F67F526IC6Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I PURCHASED THIS ITEM FOR MY NEPHEW, WHO GAVE ME HOPE WHEN I NEEDED IT.

It is my first iPad. I do own an iPhone 4S, and I did briefly purchase an iPad2 back toward the end of January. However, I took it back because I expected that the display would equal to that of my iPhone4, but it was not. I heard there would be a new one coming out in the spring, so I returned my iPad2 within one week of purchasing it. I only played with it a day or two, and so glad I did return it. The new iPad was more than well worth the wait! :)Words simply cannot describe just how intense the screen resolution is, and how vibrant the colors are. Simply SPECTACULAR!! Stunning! The speed is excellent, the photos are crisp and clear, and if someone has a small piece of fuzz on their hair, for example, it will clearly be seen in their photo, as was such with one photo that I took! :)I own a white 16GB Wi-Fi only version.There are a few issues that I have experienced, however, and also read on the Apple Support Forum that others are also experiencing. I also took my new iPad to my local Apple Store yesterday to ask some questions.First, the new iPads heat up. This is due to the new and larger battery. I was told at the Apple Store that this is nothing to be concerned about. Some, although not myself, claim that their new iPads are actually too hot to touch. I have not experienced that. Mine does get extremely warm, but, nowhere near too hot too tiuch. So, you may want to beware of that, and purchase a Smart Cover to fold and hold your iPad with. (It's a good idea to have one to protect your screen, also! :))I have also experienced issues with iTunes, and read others have, too. ITunes simply \"kicked me out\" when I tried to look at movie information, not even trying to download a movie. It kicked me out and returned to the home screen. It did this several times. Tried the re-boot, but still kicked me out. Others have reported problems with downloading content from iTunes, as well. I don't know why this is happening. I heard that one possibility could be that with so many new iPad users, all trying to sync and download, that it is causing these issues. Or, it could be a glitch that will need to be corrected by Apple. Just don't know. I'm not worried about it though, because I feel confident that it will be resolved in one way or another.The battery seems to drain pretty quickly. Especially for me because I crank my screen up to maximum brightness. :) And, so far, my new iPad takes an INCREDIBLY long time to charge. I was told at the Apple Store to be sure to let the battery run all the way down before charging, and that after a few times doing that, this will improve. Time will tell! I've read others also are experiencing this issue. I bought a 6 foot charger at the Apple Store yesterday so that I can plug in and charge, and still use while charging it. I found out that it is completely safe to use the new iPad (or any iProduct) while charging, so, that is very helpful to me.I am in love with my new iPad, and am VERY, VERY happy with it. I recommend to all. :) It is truly incredible, and better than I ever imagined it would be. :)", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "The problem with Apple products is Apple service!", "Author": "Jacob Cox Jr. \"ACC Solder\"", "ReviewID": "R2WHQW0CZO8HYT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The problem with Apple products is the absolute abismal customer care for their products.

I was told to reset the user name and password. Done! No good. Work week starts. Phone goes back on the backburner. Try again a few days later. Same results, but someone emails me back this time. Tells me to go to the \"provided\" link and try again. Done! Same result. Someone else emails me. I changed my credit card info some time ago. That was it. I need to go to the ITUNES store and manage my account. Oh. That sends me back to reset my account yet again. I did manage to stumble across a number, finally. 1-800-myapple. I call it. A virtual person answers the phone. Had to find my serial number. 40 minutes later, yes, I timed it, a human answers the phone. He's friendly. He confirms my serial number and apologized for my wait. Apparently they can tell how long I've been on the phone too. Bad news. He has to forward me to the security folkes. Looks like that is going to take another 20 minutes. Do I mind waiting? Oh.

I suppose the 1 hour and 6 minutes I've been waiting now should provide a clue. My first apple rep--I haven't spoken to the second one yet, told me there's a lot of people trying to get their accounts fixed. By the way, if you call Apple with your cell phone, make sure you plug it into your charger. Otherwise, you will need to go find it around 1 hour and 10 minutes.

It was definitely a good deal, considering the device had minimal damage and a newly replaced screen. I was set on getting the 3rd generation since it included the Retina Display without having the infamous lightning dock connector found on the newer iPad. All in all, I was very pleased with the item I received, now on to the actual device:Screen:I didn't believe all the hype at first about the Retina display, but in fact it is all true. The display is definitely stunning and features probably the best screen on any tablet, although I think the Google Nexus 10 still wins in terms of pure sharpness.Build:As stated in the review's title, you can definitely feel the premium material that was used to put this device together. I wouldn't go so far as to call it durable though, which is why I recommend you get a case and screen protector.OS:Here is where the iPad falls short. At least for now, Apple's iOS 6 is the iPad's most visible weakness. It looks and feels stale, despite the iPad's beautiful screen. The static icons just don't cut it anymore, especially if you have used Android 4.0 or above on a tablet. Hopefully iOS 7 will improve upon the software, but from the initial previews it seems to be more or less the same.Battery Life:This is where the iPad excels most notably. The 10 hour reported battery life proves to be all but true, even with the brightness and high levels. The fact that iOS is extremely simple with little to no graphical animations is what optimizes the iPad's great battery life.Productivity:I know that most people buy tablets for recreational use, but sometimes people choose to integrate it with their work life through e-mail and word processing. Unfortunately, the iPad isn't really great for either, considering that the keyboard accessories from most manufacturers are overpriced and Apple's own iWork suite is far too minimal at a high price. Also, true multitasking with multi-window support is just not present and further shows iOS' limitations.Overall, the Apple iPad is a great device for media consumption while delivering excellent battery life. If you are not able to fork up the heavy price, there are definitely cheaper options available such as the Google Nexus 10 but they arguably don't offer the same 'premium' look and feel as the iPad does.", "Date": "July 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "New iPad 32 that is a 64!", "Author": "Mary T.", "ReviewID": "R3DRI8W80DNFOL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "You sent a 64 gbs instead of a 32 Wewant to keep it but how much do we owe for the difference?", "Date": "July 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great and more space for itune downloads", "Author": "Lorance", "ReviewID": "R1QV5DANAPHFWS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The touch Screen is clear and colors are bright with no issue of any hick ups or stalling.Easy to download applications where eve your can find a wifi connection and its light weight and easy to move around with.", "Date": "June 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "good condition", "Author": "Kenneth J.

The iPad really just feels \"off\" - like it's missing something.  The OS isn't customizable, and we really miss a back button like on Android.  Not all of the apps have buttons in the same places and very little consistency, so it was a bit of annoyance just using it for daily use.If we needed this for daily/entertainment use, I would probably return it.  As it turns out, I'm a pilot and use it for Foreflight/Stratus.  For that purpose it's fantastic, but that's because Foreflight is awesome, and could be just as awesome on Android.  So the iPad doesn't deserve all the credit - but maybe some.My girlfriend loaded her Danish newspaper website, and it didn't display well at all, everything was a mess and all the flash elements were obviously broken.  The same site loads perfectly, flash and all, on the Transformer tablet.This is my first experience with iOS and it just feels really dumbed down and overly simplistic, but in a bad way.  Missing flash is a very real problem and I kind of think anyone honest with themselves would freely admit that Android is far superior at this time.The battery life is fantastic and will last for a couple days of flying without a recharge, that's a big bonus.  The screen is quite nice though the benefits with the retina display just aren't all that noticeable in the real world.  Does it look nice?  Totally.The iPad is a very well polished device, but it's trying too hard to be simplistic to the point where it becomes more of a toy for a 5 year old child than a device for an adult.  I highly recommend Android over the iPad, and for me, I prefer my Win 7 Slate - I need a real OS.", "Date": "August 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Too Heavy and Hot!!

The reason I am assigning a \"1 star\" rating to this product is NOT because we bought a defective unit. Nor am I disappointed with the service: every time I went to the Apple Store to get help (and that happened a lot!), a perky 16-year-old would materialize out of thin air and show me how to press the only button available to make the gizmo work.But herein is the rub: if buying an iPad, any iPad, please be aware of its limitations. I THOUGHT I WAS GETTING A SMALL COMPUTER, WHAT I GOT WAS A LARGE CELL PHONE WITHOUT THE PHONE!PROs:-- it looks cool;-- my kids love it;-- yes, there are a lot of free apps in the AppStore;-- you can check your eMail pretty much anywhere and any timeCONs:-- many \"free\" iPad apps are \"teasers;\" i.e. they have limited functions and you have to pay to get a full version of these apps only to discover that they are often faulty;-- NO Java support-- NO Flash media support (although the iPad does come with a free YouTube app)-- NO preloaded apps that would let you manage Word-type documents or Excell-type spread sheets (you have to buy those but, again, once you do, you soon realize that they are nowhere close to the quality of the ones you use on your desktop [Mac or Windows])-- most importantly, there is NO ABILITY TO MANAGE YOUR OWN FILES! This one particular lacking feature drives me to distraction! There are several apps you can BUY that would allow you to manage your OWN files but, again, they are very poorly designed and often do not interact well with iTunes, Windows, or, surprisingly, iPad's own OS system .-- and here is another critical issue: EVERYTHING MUST BE SYNC'd via iTunes. If you are running a Windows desktop, this may be (and in my case indeed IS) a serious problem. Things purchased via iTunes, iStore, AppStore, etc, usually manage to get to your iPad unscathed. Other content (e.g. I am an eBook fan and purchase my eBooks in multiple places on the Net) are not so fortunate. Although, Apple's iBook app is free and allows you to use both .pdf and .ePub formats (you can also install a free Kindle app for .mobi books),  actually getting your books onto your iPad may be difficult, if not impossible. You cannot \"drag-and-drop\" your book files (or any other files) onto your iPad. Everything MUST BE SYNC'd with iTunes, an app called \"DropBox,\" or some other app. If your iTunes does not get along with your desktop (usually a PROBLEM FOR WINDOWS users like me),  you will end up spending endless grim nights uninstalling iTunes, re-installing iTunes, wiping your iPad clean, sync'ing and re-sync'ing your iPad again, and again, and again.-- The Camera is OK, but keep in mind that all your videos will be in .mov format and may not play on all desktops --you will need a special converter to re-code the formats for non-Apple media players; you will need to install \"Quick Time for Windows\" on your desktop if you are running Windows.-- finally, there is noway to increase the amount of memory for the device as there is NO slot for a memory expansion card. I can't believe it! Every tablet has it BUT iPad. So you are pretty much stuck with 16 gB, 32 gB, or 64 gB tablet without ever having any hope of expanding!OVERALL :  I feel so bad that my wife spent all that money, time, and effort to get me this. I feel awful that her loving good intentions made us spend ~ $900 for something that turned out to be just an appallingly expensive toy, poorly engineered, thoughtlessly designed, and very frustrating to use. (The MSRP is ~ $600 - 700, but there are sales tax, additional warranty, front cover, back cover, USB attachments, and other apparel that one needs for this thing, hence the enormous price!)  The good thing is: it is possible to easily re-set it back to factory settings. And we still have the original box. I think it will make a great (and a VERY EXPENSIVE) Christmas gift for my in-laws. For Windows users (like me): please, think hard before sinking all that money into this purchase! Again, keep in mind, this is NOT a small and portable computer, IT IS ESSENTIALLY A SmartPhone WITHOUT THE PHONE!... just a bit bigger, though...", "Date": "December 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not a notebook or desktop", "Author": "Michael H.

If you have nothing to compare against, it depends. If you are coming from Android world, there may be some surprises.I got 64GB 4G LTE version. LTE version mainly for GPS as WiFiversion does not have GPS. I am big into using voice guided navigation. First let me go through areas which can be improved or what I find as negatives. Everyone gives positives which I will surely give in plenty at the end.1. Having no back button, I do find a bit troubling initially, but got used to quickly. I used iPhone, went back to android and now used a iPad. You have to exit each app in entirety before you can go and launch another. But if you back to original app, and if it supports multitasking, you can continue from where you left off.2. All tablets are heavy and one has to set expectations for one handed usage. This is compared to Kindle. So set your expectations3. Having no siri is a bummer, I thought Apple will have that. Hope a software update will fix it and they upgrade the data center machines to handle it.4. Voice dictation has lot to improve. Google voice dictation and decipher is unbeatable5. In App store after you buy each app, it jumps to new app. I often want to buy several apps at a time. Apps cannot be launched immediately, it takes time, so having ability download and trigger multiple app purchases in one screen will be good. For example a car racing game I downloaded was 1.3 GB!6. I wish you can pack more apps in each page like the bottom bar which can have 6 apps.7. iPad does not have an app/hardware to do laser dental floss for you :)Now the Positives. The positives outnumber the negatives by a huge margin.1. The display is very sharp. Since I have not used any tablet in the past for prolonged periods, there is no reference for me, but looks sharp. I have used Archos couple of years back.2. Having 64GB was a boon as I have GBs of music, photos and pdf documents. pdf documents render beautifully in this ipad. text is sharp and crisp.3. Navigon, mow owned by Garmin is fantastic. It is like having a large map with you. The details and voice guided directions are excellent.4. Settings menu is just great, I played around with all options in settings. Accessibility options are great. Being able to increase font sizes is excellent. Black on white and white on black are also great.5. The apps are very fluid and apps like Kindle is excellent6. Touch response is just awesome. No android phone can even come close to it. I used Archos android tablet in past and iPad is so smooth  ---> major point7. Overall OS/sandboxing mode is very secure. I trust iPad and iOS far more than Android though I am a fan of open source software. Chances of malware/virus are slimmer than in other non iOS phones/smartphones. ---> major point8. Integrated hardware/OS makes everything looks beautiful9. Diagnostics menu in settings lets you look into code dumps and crash reports. It gives you a sneak peak to how things work inside if you are not a iOS developer10. Smartcover design is genius11. Kids just get it. My 3rd grade daughter started using without even thinking it as a computer. I realized what ubiquitous computing meant. It just comes naturally to kids who have no fear and want to get their work done whether to make cakes using cake doodle, play ping pong, paint the screen or read books/take pictures/modify the photos. They for a second don't think it is a computer, It should do everything.12. I have not tried 4G yet. I will use while travelling only but will use GPS frequently13. Camera is awesome in this iPad. You see pictures in big clear screen. If you print you may print in 4x6, so your print is smaller than what you see, just the reverse of norm. iPhoto is terrific.14. Video quality looks great for shooting indoors. I don't think I will shoot outdoors in a beach with this.15. Having SD card adapter/camera connector is a big plus for me.16. I won't go into the basics, browsing/email/notepad/ etc. There is nothing more for me to say about them. You will reinvent browsing with this device.17. I will keep adding some apps I keep using on this - Notetaker HD, tweetbot, pogoplug, navigon, kindle (retina support), flipboard, dictionary, iPhoto, google, Amazon, lastpass, iTunes U (great app), Onenote, Zite, Google earth, ABC Player, Google currents, Solarwalk.Current trend for me seem to be  start day with smartphone, day with laptops, nights/weekends on iPads!", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Tablet Ever", "Author": "Joe Rose", "ReviewID": "R3F0UQBUKUOR9W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "APPLE RULES.

Over the last few years, I have thought about moving on. For example, my new MacBook's battery died within two years (new ones cost about $175!) This iPad was great, but the digitizer (glass) broke and it is extremely fragile. It can cost about $250-$500 to fix (you can get one or two tables for the price of the repair alone). By contrast, Amazon has always replaced my items either for free or at a reduced cost. My first Kindle reader broke due to wear and tear, and they gave me a new one at a reduced price. When the new one broke, they replaced it for free (Apple will never do this unless you pay for apple care, which is more akin to gambling than to customer service). I have had two HP computers through work, and they seemed much more sturdy and the battery lasted longer than my MacBook; and were definitely more reliable than my iPad (which with a cracked screen is basically useless).In terms of fun and the number of apps, the iPad may be better. But in terms of sturdiness, product quality, and the ability to replace when broken, I think the Kindle fire would definitely be a better purchase. For the amount I have spent on the iPad and all of the issues associated with it, I could have had about three fires. It seems like I can get everything in Apple that I can in Amazon (syncing, personal cloud, etc.), except that Amazon is less in terms of dollars, and has better customer service and stands behind their products a lot better.

I do see where they have some flaws. But if you're wondering if the iPad is worth the money, it absolutely is. You get what you pay for, and the iPad is a perfect example of it.I skipped the iPad 2 because they did not come out with the retina display, which makes everything, most notably text, much more sharp then it has been previously. If you do any fair amount of reading on the device, you need to get the third generation iPad, and don't look at the previous models. It will be entirely worth it, and you will not look back or regret your decision.And for the people who are confused why Apple chose not to name this device the iPad 3, I would like to help with a brief explanation. Apple currently has many products where they do not have a numbering system in the official title of the device, like the iPod, iPod touch, MacBook, MacBook Pro, Apple TV, and so on. It's simply labeled just with the title of the device, and the way people distinguish it from previous models is to simply refer to it as the first, second or third generation, etc. Evidently they are going to do this with the iPad now as well, and you can count on the fact that the next iPhone that will be released will not be called the iPhone 5. :-) I partially digress, but for the people who are wondering about this with any possible confusion, I hope this clears some of it up.I could get into all of the features that it has, but if you're looking for an overall device that does everything extremely well and fast, look no more and get this third generation iPad. It's easy to use and fast, but most importantly, it is fun and productive.", "Date": "March 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "A comparision with Samsung Galaxy Tab 8.9", "Author": "L. Jacobs", "ReviewID": "R3HH4893BPGUYP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have a Samsung Galaxy Tab 8.9 and love it.  Decided to try the new iPad and would like to offer some comparisons.Display - The iPad's display is certainly sharper than the Tab, but not by much.Display size - I prefer the 8.9 size to the iPad's larger screen. Simply easier to carry around.  iPad better for reading magazines but prefer the Tab for almost everything else. Really a matter of preference.Speed - iPad is faster.Heat - I live in a warm climate and find the iPad runs hot at times.  No problem with the Galaxy Tab.Build quality - About the same.  iPad may be a bit better but Galaxy Tab is also well made.Weight - The Tab is feather light, being less than a pound.  The iPad feels like a tank in comparison, a major disadvantage.Apps - Although the iPad has significantly more apps, the Android system is starting to catch up. So far, I have found everything I need on the Android app  stores.Interface - A matter of preference.  I appreciate the tightness of the IOS but prefer the openness and flexibility of the Android operating system.Bottom line.  Most people flock to the iPad because it is the best known and best integrated of the tablets.  However, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 8.9 offers some advantages in size, weight and flexibility.

Why kick the company to the curb that has already done all the work, put all the money needed into it, and is proven itself. Why? Apple has gotten a big head again, and believes that whatever it makes it just has to be better.Touch sensitivity: I used my friends iPad 2 for awhile after he upgraded to the iPad 3. He told me I had to try the new version. The touch sensitivity seems to be off. It does not have the response of the iPad 2, Samsung Tab, or even a Kindle I used to have.Retina display failure: I see no difference between the iPad 2 and the new iPad. If you are looking at upgrading to the new one for its display don't. There is nothing special about it. It is just a numbers game.Must use iTunes: iTunes is one of the main reasons I will never own an Apple product. This software is awful. I cannot believe they have not made it easier to use. If you want to buy all your stuff through apple then yes, oh yes they make it easier. But what if you are not brain wasted by apple and you want to use Amazon to get your music for a better price? Not so easy to get it on the iPad. The software is a joke.No support for other video formats. This device unlike all its competitors has said no to supporting standardized formats. If you are buying this device and wanting to transfer your current videos to it, don't. It will only support the apple format.Your apple ID: This is nearly the worst part of the iPad itself. You cannot do anything on the iPad without this ID. It is terrible, and if you forget your security questions you will need a crack team that can get into Fort Knox to get back in. Why are these questions so important? Well it took me over a month to help my mother fully get back into her apple ID because if you upgrade to a new apple product and you do not know those questions? Good Luck! You may never get back in. And if you have spent a lot of money in iTunes it could be lost. BEWARE: write down your security questions.So much for ease of use. I have had in the past year family come up saying with a big smile I just got the iPad. I tell them good luck with that. They go off and \"play\" with it for awhile. Then they come back and ask how to you download apps, how do you transfer music, how can you put DVD's I already own on it, how can I view this website it says flash not installed, and the list goes on.
