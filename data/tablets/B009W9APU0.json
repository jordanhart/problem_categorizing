Mcgusty \"EddyMac71\"", "ReviewID": "RT8ZEN18U0YUX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As much as I didn't want to buy another iPad for my new tablet, Apple makes great hardware and has a nice, simple, stable operating system.  If they just stuck with that I'd never leave them.  Unfortunately I love my Google also and Apple is pulling an AOL by trying to make its customers be stuck with their apps.  We'll see how that works out for them, but they lost me as an iPhone customer because of it.That's my Apple rant :)  Moving on to the review, the 'new' new IPad, aka iPad 4, is nice and quick!  Had the original iPad and it became obsolete pretty quickly due to the small 256MB of memory - great for a game of freecell, but it couldn't hold more than a few web pages without having to do constant refreshes when you switch tabs, very annoying, hardly ever used it eventually.  Bought an iPad 3 for my girlfriend, she didn't like it and we returned it to buy $100 necklace which she loved.  Almost bought an iPad mini, cute size, then found out Apple only put in 512MB of memory - it can't handle many web pages without doing the annoying refresh thing either - already obsolete when it hit the shelves.  So iPad 4 had the nice high res screen and 1 gig of memory, still only half the 2 gigs that comparable Android tablets have, but that's why we'll all have to buy another tablet in a year or two rather than 3-4 years for any other electronic device - planned obsolescence, slightly annoying also.  I would do a Nexus 7 over the mini, but since I have an Android phone with a nice large screen (which I love compared to my iPhones), a Nexus 7 is too similar.So long story short, I like and use my iPad 4 a lot more than I thought I would, it's still currently the best tablet as of February 2013.  The higher res screen, although not a big difference in the store, is actually really nice once you get used to it.  My MacBook Air looks old now in comparison and I'll have to upgrade that when Apple adds the Retina display on the next generation.  Web pages look great, HD apps are more available now and I even use my iPad to read with the Kindle app ... although I suspect Apple will take that away from you at some point also, ha!  Greedy, oh well.  Best of all the iPad is very quick and has great battery life so far, using mostly for web browsing and not gaming.WIFI claim of double the speed - FALSE.  One of my big factors of getting the iPad was its claim of double the WIFI speeds as I want quick internet browsing.  No one at Apple Store knows how or why it will give you this or whether it will do it without special equipment like a new router.  So here is the deal - the new iPad gets HALF, not double, the WIFI speed of my three year old 2010 MacBook Air on the same (standard 2.4mhz) high speed cable modem WIFI router.  I get about 66Mbps (speedtest.net) on my 2010 MacBook Air and only about 32Mbps on the new iPad.  Tested it every way possible and the results only get worse if you adjust your router settings.  Long story short, you need to get a new dual band (2.4mhz & 5 mhz) router if you want to get the higher claimed speed, but the claimed speed is only in comparison to prior iPads.  Essentially buying a new router and going though the pain of setting that up with your ISP is the only way to get back to the wireless speeds Apple could do three years ago on a standard 2.4mhz WIFI router.  Browsing is fairly quick and will obviously depend on your broadband connection, but to claim double and then not even equal three year old speeds is a little annoying.In conclusion, with all the little issues that Apple makes me not like them as a company, they still do make great hardware and they have a stable operating platform.  If you are looking for a quick, smooth, full size tablet, the new iPad is hard to beat.  We'll see what the rest of 2013 has to bring.  As Android apps convert to full size tablet and HD over time, I think next year Apple will see a lot more competition.  All I want is my Google apps on my iPad, is that too much to ask for to keep me an Apple customer in the future?  Will have to go through the hassle of jailbreaking this to be able to make Chrome my default browser and then Apple will not allow updates, slightly annoying.  But, yes, it's a really nice tablet otherwise.", "Date": "February 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Beware Apple support", "Author": "Rob Haff", "ReviewID": "R1UNU7YAKVP7S3", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The ipad is a good product, but beware Apple support if you purchase online!  I believe it's a \"dirty little secret\"...when you purchase an Apple product on-line...it seems you are treated differently when it comes to support?  You decide....  After recieving my $800 defective Ipad in the mail, I was told by Apple Care on the phone to \"go to a store and they'll take care of it\", so I did so and drove for an hour to the closest Apple store in Miami.  So believe it or not,  I could not get a repair job OR replacement from that store...or any of the 4 stores in the Miami area!  How could this be I asked???  Maybe because I purchased my ipad from Amazon?  I couldn't get a straight answer from any of the folks at the store but when I asked if they actually did not have an ipad in the store to replace mine, the answer was \"warranty replacements come from a different inventory than ones for sale\".  And not one store in the greater Miami area had a \"Replacement\", according to them.  I was told my only option was to go to a UPS store, and mail it via ground to them, and then in a week or so they would send me a \"Replacement\".  Again, they could not tell me if it would be a new one, or a Refurb.  Very disappointing from one of the most profitable corporations in the world.  If I could do it again, I'd try a Samsung Tab.", "Date": "April 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Too many issues", "Author": "Jason M Parnes", "ReviewID": "R2UEDSGK0XUJQZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Let me start by saying that the mediocre rating on this product had nothing to do with the seller I went through.  I had several issues with the product when I first received the iPad, starting with a small issue of the home screen button not functioning properly.  This was then compounded into a larger issue by the Apple \"genius\" not being such of a genius and replacing my iPad with a new ones and not swapping my SIM card (this was after a 3 hour wait at the Apple store).  After several more hours on the phone with both Apple and Verizon, I was finally able to get them to over-night me a new SIM card and thought everything should be fine... wrong.The big issue I am now having is a \"No SIM card\" error, which I clearly do have as evidenced by the SIM card in my iPad.  I have done some Google searching and have noticed that many others are having the same issue.  My iPad will work great for some time and then give me that error and no longer let me connect to the internet through my Verizon service.All in all, when the iPad is working, its amazing, however when you pay >$700 for an item you expect it to work perfectly without having to lose hours of your time at the Apple store and on the phone.  The customer service Apple has provided to me during this time is also making me rethink my switch to Apple products.", "Date": "January 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing product and customer service", "Author": "T.

Rodrigues \"I'd rather be cycling\"", "ReviewID": "RC6W0KOEYKB3X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "On the plus side the IPad has a fast charge time, long battery life, good Wi-Fi, a robust cpu, and an excellent display. That said, it's not without some flaws and annoyances. Foremost, there's no consistent method to back navigate. Perhaps, this was one of those cases where design overrules function; in order to keep the device looking elegant they sacrificed functionality. The result is confusion and inconsistency. In some cases you find yourself navigating back via the app itself; however sometimes you need to use the home function or start swiping. For example, at one point I opened a PDF that was attached to an email but then I could not easily find a way to close the PDF to return to the inbox. There's no consistency as to where the back function is to be found or what it may be called. Often you are forced to make reaches across the screen whereas if there was one consistent placement for a back function you always know where it is. The same is true for getting a list of apps running in the background. You are forced to use a awkward four finger up motion.  Why not just give us a consistent button for a list of running apps?  I found the need to use 4 finger swipes annoying.. Another missing function is the cancel key. If you accidentally start to download a huge file and want to abort - where's the key to stop the download?  The app store is annoying as you can't search for apps in ways of your choosing. Why not offer advanced search that would give you some options to sort and filter?  Another issue I have with the device is its dependence on iTunes. Certain files cannot be removed from the device unless you are on iTunes, really? Why? I should be able to delete files off my device. I'm assuming there's an app for doing that but really - why not just make that part of the OS? Speaking of what's not included - why not include a free calculator? Do I really need to shop for a basic calculator? The native Maps app is a work in progress with many roads or local features not labeled correctly. If you want to hook this device to a camera you need to purchase a special adapter but check the reviews for the adapter as many users are reporting it no longer works after the latest OS update. There's no easy way to manage your cookies in safari. In advanced setting you can either delete all cookie data or none.  It has a very nice display however I refuse to adopt Apple marketing speak and call it \"retina\" display. Don't bother thinking you'll be able to send anything to your printer unless of course you have a specific \"air\" printer that will work with the Apple iOS. I could go on but hopefully you get the point that this device has both strong and weak points.", "Date": "June 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Multipurpose Tablet", "Author": "Student", "ReviewID": "R2NVMYCXD1WBB6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This product is amazing. It's not perfect, but considering that I'll have it for at least 2 years and I've used it every day so far, I certainly get my $.40 worth each day! It's very sturdy and I know it will hold up well, as my other Apple products have. I have friends who still use their original iPads (they work just fine, but many applications don't run on the operating system). I have a Kindle (an old version), and still love my Kindle as a reader. It's the only way I can read in the sunlight and it's SO lightweight. Eventually, I'll upgrade to a new Kindle reader, but I see them as having different purposes. The iPad is a mini computer, and the non-Fire Kindle is the equivalent of carrying around a book (or a thousand).iPad 3 vs. iPad 4:I purchased the version right before this one--the iPad 3--several weeks before the announcement of this version. I called Apple a few days after the announcement, and they immediately set me up with a way to return the iPad 3 to repurchase the newest version. I realize that some people were angry about the announcement, but there has to be a cut off date for new technology at some point, and I thought that Apple treated me as well or better than I've seen from any other technology company.Yes, both the iPad 3 and 4 have very crisp, clear screens (which are stunning for video quality compared to my Macbook from 2010). However, the increased speed of the iPad 4 makes the video quality seem clearer. It's difficult to explain, but movies definitely got a bit crisper. Also, the increased speed really is incredible when opening apps and running a lot at once. I'd say the time it takes to open large applications is cut in half. But, I was so impressed with the iPad 3 when it came, and if I hadn't been able to exchange it, I would still give it a 5-star review--it's definitely not \"obsolete.\"Finally, what makes the iPad special? First, no one *needs* one. But now that I have one, it's sure useful and I wouldn't want to go back to life before I got one. Here's why:* I sit at school or at work in front of a computer all day. I am always typing or reading on the screen. Coming come to something different is nice--it's refreshing. I'd rather watch a tv show on a 10\" iPad than any other non-TV device (laptop, tablet, phone, etc.). The picture quality is great for movies and browsing, and the 10\" screen is big enough to share if a friend and I want to watch something together. A 7\" isn't enough for that or big enough to basically serve as a TV replacement.* It is functional enough to REPLACE a computer. Don't get me wrong, I still need my computer for editing files, serious typing, spreadsheets, etc. But right after I got the ipad, I went on a 10-day trip. No computer, no problem. I could take care of all of my emails from work and school, keep in touch, keep up with my finances, etc. It was anything I'd need for a non-work trip. Web browsing works just as well as a laptop for 95% of sites, and there's an app for many that even improves the browsing experience.* Given the first two points, I think owning an iPad will greatly extend the life of my laptop. I probably use my laptop 50% less now that I have an iPad, so I'll probably get an extra year of life out of my laptop as a result. That, in itself, makes the purchase of an iPad worth it in my eyes.* Integration with other Mac devices. This doesn't apply to everyone, but if you're a Mac user for a laptop or an iPhone, I'd highly recommend the iPad over alternatives, even if it's more expensive. If you're hooked on Windows products or Google products, I'd consider those devices.* The number of apps. I know that apps are everywhere these days, but, it seems at least, that there are still the most applications for Apple devices. The difference is especially noticeable in non-retail applications. For example, I've tried dozens of \"to do\" and organizer apps, and my favorite, Errands, is only available on iOS. Another of my favorites, Fotopedia Heritage (a gorgeous display of UNESCO World Heritage photography), is only on iPad. So far (and this may change), a lot of companies also choose to release new iOS versions of applications first. This edge will decrease with time, but for now it is still a significant \"plus\" for an iPad over other tablets for those who are into applications. Also, I can run most iPhone apps on the iPad, and there's an easy way to tell the difference (e.g. you can search just for iPad apps or for iPhone/iPad/iPod apps). Not sure if you can do this on other tablets, but I've found it useful (e.g. my bank only has an iphone app, but I can still run it on my iPad). Finally, though, just to be clear, this is NOT just a device for running applications. I could do almost everything I choose to do through applications just by using a web browser.* The number of accessories. Many won't care about this, but some will. If you like to have cases to protect your electronics, the sheer number for iPad is a draw (not a huge one, but the sprinkles on the cake). Everything's out there, from cheap plastic covers to the smart cover (the one that folds as a stand) to professional-looking leather folios to designer soft zip cases. It can be a fashion statement, but it's more likely just a way to make sure to keep your device safe.* Finally, and this may be petty, but it's the most professional device. In the field I know (law), partners at law firms and federal judges use iPads, not other devices to read briefs, send emails, etc. I've never seen anyone doing work on a Kindle device and I've never even seen another tablet in a professional setting. Part of this may be that it's a well-established product, and part may be that the 10-inch screen is nice for reading, even if it's bulkier. Being able to feel comfortable that you can carry your device in a professional environment may matter for some, and the iPad definitely delivers above other devices there.", "Date": "December 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "As good as advertised", "Author": "stu", "ReviewID": "RMGBPKEZ1NMXG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Grandma bought this for our Daughter on her Birthday.

Here I am going to talk about what 'new' features you see in the IPad 4 (also called the 'new' IPad).First off.. they don't make the IPad 3 anymore.. when this was created it was immediately a replacement for the IPad 3.  There wasn't a lot of fanfare as this wasn't a huge upgrade over the 3 and was just released with the new IPad Mini.The two main features (for those in the US):- Retina display.. I never thought the display was bad, but this is an improvement.  Compared next to the original IPad 3 there is a difference, albeit not overly noticeable unless you get an app that was made for the retina display (not many out there yet as the product isn't even 30 days old yet).  The glare issue is still there.  If you're using this outside it's basically like looking in the mirror if the sun is at a bad angle. Nothing changed on that front.- Faster speed. Same as above I never thought it was an issue but when using some speed tests it is faster and you'll notice, especially when multitasking, the apps run smoother with less 'hitches'.Also:- Like the IPad Mini and the new phone it has the 8-pin adapter and not the 'old' 30 pin insert.Everything else.. the exact same as the former IPad 3. Battery life is great and while I'm not a 'heavy' user of the IPad (mainly used for web surfing, basic apps, etc..) it fits all of my needs.  Overall, if you have the IPad 3 should you upgrade?  I don't see a major reason unless you're the type that HAS to have the latest and greatest.  I just happened to finally be in the market for one (after years of indifference) and with my roommate having the IPad 3 it was an easy comparison.", "Date": "November 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "My first iPad", "Author": "W.

Basically from day 1 they loaded up the iPad with apps of all sort, so much so that there was not enough space to get updates.  They have periodically come to me to complain about lack of wifi connectivity, I usually restarted the device and most of the time it would connect (for a time at least).  I assumed this was some sort of a software issue that would be corrected when I upgraded.  So I finally wiped off the iPad and upgraded and have only had a greyed out  wifi on switch.  We live in the great midwest nowhere close to an apple store.  I finally made a trip to Des Moines IA to take to the apple store there for service.

Although it is sturdy and slim, it's still the same weight at around 650g. I had hoped for a reduction in weight since the iPad 3 was around 50g heavier than the iPad 2. The battery lasted 12 hours when I was playing videos matching the time achieved by the smaller iPad Mini.The 10in screen still has the same 2,048x1,536 pixel resolution. It's very sharp and bright with exceptional image quality, especially when compared to lower resolution tablets like the iPad Mini. Only the upcoming Samsung Nexus 10 Android tablet will have a display potentially capable of matching it.All the changes are on the inside rather than the outside. The A6X dual-core processor is twice as fast as the iPad 3's A5X chip, but this will make little real difference until apps are designed to take advantage of it. Apple will doubtless release features in future versions of iOS that will only run on the A6X, but that has yet to happen.The iPad 4 is thankfully compatible with the recently launched EE LTE network.HD FacetimeI was pleased with Video chatting and that the front-facing camera now records in 720p resolution which gave better, more accurate-looking video although the speed of my broadband connection did also affect image quality.The iPad 4 may be a modest upgrade over its predecessor but it's still the best 10in tablet so far, which says just as much about the competition as it does about Apple's tablet.

Safari takes longer to load up internet pages....and much more.  The new upgrade is a farce and I will not buy another iPhone (on my 5th) or iPad again.  Once these are gone, I will not replace them.  My suggestion would be to learn another operating system.  Androids are cheaper, and I've found my Kindle to be a new companion and easier to use since IOS-7.  The system used to be very user friendly and actually kinda classy looking, but now it's design takes after  operating in an old Windows computer in SAFE mode 24-7.  And who wants that. It is absolutely NOT visually stimulating at all.  We went from a classy Cadillac Made In the USA look to a cheap Chinese knockoff.  Again, buy something else....  Apple has stepped into the Microsoft realm of hated upgrades....", "Date": "October 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "2nd time is a charm !!!!!", "Author": "Johnny \"J.O.\"", "ReviewID": "R25SRUMB8L5KJS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my 2nd iPad. I tried one of the 1st models and liked them, but didn't really \"Love\" them. After giving my iPad #1 away I took another shot. I LOVE ipad 4 Iris. Unlike a Laptop the iPad is ALWAYS connected, contrary to what others have said I have a 24/7 SOLID internet connection never has it dropped, not even once ???. Now this may be since I bought the iPad version without any phone company card/designation ?? Not sure, but it is reliably connected when I open the magnetic cover..even after a full nights sleep, no wait at all..INSTANT !!!!. The other thing that is exceptional is the SPEED of browsing. VERY FAST !!! much better than my older iPad. We do have a very fast cable modem though fyi. I bought this iPad solely for travel and surfing. For high levels of accounting tasks and say Photoshop applications I still prefer a full sized keyboard with a desktop PC. All in all I am very happy I gave a tablet a 2nd choice.

At the time when I was ready to purchase the 128gb cellular version it was going for a 1000 dollars plus on this website, when apple stores and bestbuy stores were selling this for $929 plus tax. 2. Some of the reviews suggested the seller was actually sending people used iPads when paying clearly buying \"new\" products.Anyways, I love it, its fast, easy to use. You get what you basically put into it, the app store is amazing with so many things that make this ipad great. I can not believe I did not own one sooner.The only thing I can not figure out how to do is, is be able to send multiple attachments within a email. I hope some new application or apple fixes this issue. Its easy to do one at a time, but its not efficient. It seems like a common problem and question that is asked i noticed when googling this issue.My iPad has had none of the issues addressed earlier.

It does some things faster, and much more efficiently than my laptop.As a Musician, I can use Garage Band, and video editing apps, for our live footage, and even editing our music videos.  It does this quickly, seamlessly, and without crashing, (Again, ala Windows), all on something I can carry to a restaurant, or Starbucks.  I got a keyboard and case for the thing, for $30.00 on Amazon, and now, my laptop, just kind of sits there.Don't hesitate.

Likely because fonts and such are all still the same size. For photographers, the increased resolution will result in extra sharpness, but for most users it won't make a bit of difference.-- The latest iPad really hasn't added much; it's competitors have been adding innovative designs and features since it came out. Apple needs to come up with a creative twist on the iPad that makes the cost difference worth the purchase.Bottom Line: I have bought iPads for work use, to test products and features we develop.

I will only say that  indeed the iPad works very well and you will be pleased with it.  I will also briefly tell you my own story to try another  tablet that left me completely unsatisfied and very disappointed: Before trying the IPad with Retina Display, I tried the most recent version of Amazon's tablet, the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" 4G LTE Wireless with 64G.The most powerful aspect of a tablet (according to my opinion) is its ability to establish a wireless connection. Without it, it is just a useless piece of extra weight someone carries around. And, unfortunately for Amazon, the Kindle's wireless card is not working as it should be.  In my home, the tablet was loosing connection with the router continually (even when I was keeping them within 1-2 feet from each other) for unknown reasons. When the connection was on, I opened some simple web pages but the downloading was very slow. Trying to open cnn.com, the downloading was so excruciatingly slow that the tablet went to sleep on its own.... And this happened multiple times, not once.  When I took it to an area where, in order to use the net, you must accept the terms and conditions, the connection was made but the browser got confused. The connection was lost and my efforts to reestablish it got fruitless. Although I use computers and other electronic devices on a daily basis and encountering problems is not foreign to me, with the Kindle I got tired and discouraged very quickly and I returned the tablet to Amazon  30 hours after I received it. The experience with the iPad has been completely the opposite. It worked immediately. The connections are relatively fast (often restricted by the lines themselves).  There is a tremendous number of apps and work well although some of the free ones are quite annoying since they broadcast so many ads that make their use very irritating. (Incidentally: At the time I am writing this review, Amazon's app for streaming video is not working on the iPad with retina display although it was working for the previous iPad models. One cannot login to his/her prime membership!)Overall, if you are thinking to buy a tablet, I would strongly recommend to buy  an iPad. However, think well before you decide. Amazon is great in returns (and  I am a very satisfied Prime customer); it will refund your money if you do not like the Kindle. However, Apple has a restocking fee (15% at least; may even vary from store to store); hence you may loose a considerable amount of money if you decide to return the iPad.", "Date": "May 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome.", "Author": "Aditya K.", "ReviewID": "R75RND1N2IJVQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Retina screen.

Also, when you use it for very long, the ipad get warm. I tried with different wall chargers (original 12W) and it is the same. The charging seem to take longer than the iPad2.I would stay away from iPad 4 is you are thinking of buying it for retina display.UPDATES: Contacted Amazon and the Seller. They suggested that I return the iPad4. I confirmed with Apple that iPad4 is ok and the charger need replacement.

As noted on another review, the only drawback with the Ipad is that there's no room for expansion of storage space and you cannot just watch any video off line that you want: it has to be compatible with the Ipad.

I found myself in a job where I am on very remote locations with quite a bit of downtime and finally decided that I could use one.I have been absolutely thrilled with this device. It is extremely stable, even with the new iOS 7 operating system. I am very happy that I chose the Retina model, because the screen is basically perfect. For everything from web browsing to watching Netflix, the quality of video and images is second to none.App performance on the iPad Retina is superb, and many of the iPad specific apps are simply mind-blowing, particularly some of the art apps like Sketchbook Pro and Procreate. I recently acquired an Adonit Jot 4, which is a pressure sensitive stylus that connects via Bluetooth, and it works like something out of the future. Just crazy good. For forum participation, writing Amazon reviews, etc., I prefer my laptop simply because I don't like typing on a touchscreen, but that's just my personal preference. I can get around on the touchscreen and if I really wanted a physical keyboard, there are several available. But that's not really what the iPad is all about. It's not there to replace your computer; it's a different type of device that excels at browsing and media consumption and is portable in a way that no laptop is.Though it takes a bit longer than I would like to take a full charge, the battery life is excellent, and I rarely find myself needing to charge when I am out and about.As a media consumption / web browsing device, the iPad Retina is ideal. The screen is so amazing that it is generally preferable to me over a larger computer or laptop screen for these purposes. I take a star off of my rating because USB connectivity would be REALLY helpful for those who would like to watch movies that they have stored on an external drive. There really is no reason that the iPad shouldn't have USB.I love my iPad, and it is so usable in this current configuration that I don't see myself having to replace it with the latest and greatest for many years.", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "very cool", "Author": "TSKPP", "ReviewID": "R1AUZXO9SSK1RI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My first ipad!

When I first heard about the Retina display, I was sort of shocked by it and a bit doubtful. I thought there was no way that they can make the display any better... but I was wrong, it looks better than any still photo! It looks more real, realer. It is absolutely amazing. I got the 16GB Wifi only and have not had a problem with it once. I did get this one since I was not interested in the iPad Air that they had coming out, and I already had a 7 inch Kindle, so I was not interested in the iPad mini that was already on sale.I do not regret this purchase at all, everything on it works wonderfully, I got a Fintie case for it that rotates which is wonderful, and I must say that this iPad is the only thing in the world that is as close to perfect as anything or anyone can get. Pictures look wonderful, games look fantastic, and The Cloud works very well on this device. There is no set up time, just enter your email and password (or make an account) and that is it you are ready to use/share on The Cloud.I have to say now after experiencing Apple and their products, I now will be purchasing all their products (the products that I need) so they can all work together and accommodate one another. Right now I have an iMac and iPad and they work wonderfully together. Syncing my PC takes a bit more time, but it does indeed work. Although it is not as quick or seamless as my Apple products syncing with each other, but of course they are using the same iOS, etc. so that is understandable.This device is a masterpiece, best little computer there is, and is a absolute pleasure to have.5 stars all the way!!

If I don't like the Apple I will return it and get my money back.After using my Apple for a few weeks now, I am totally sold on this product!  If fact I am considering a total change to Apple for all of my computer needs!  Next it will be a switch from my Dell desktop to the Apple 27 inch desktop.  I have been a Dell customer for approximately 20 years!Apple is a more expensive way to go, but I feel it is the best way for me.  I think Apple products are very much worth the price difference..in my opinion!Why have I strayed somewhat away from the review of the Apple I-pad!

It briefly showed a \"shaky\" \"blurred\" screen for a second or so. And then back to normal.Then we started to explore its functionality like taking pictures etc. The frequency of \"shaky\" screen by now increases. Then we tried to download some free games. After we downloaded the first free game (I do not remember which, our purpose was just testing) app, it went black. This time for 15 minutes or so.

But even though the Amazon Market Place's packaging for shipment was as good as required for shipping and delivering this type of merchandise, and that the Apple iPad factory box was undamaged, both wrappings intact and unopened, the iPad screen came with a noticeable two centimeter hairline scratch on top center, right below the camera lens. The scratch was visible through the factory envelope-like cellophane wrapping around the iPad itself. That type of scratch, could not had happened at the seller's warehouses, nor during transportation/delivery because it requires direct contact with the screen to produce it and as I explained the delivery package and product box where undamaged and unopened, so responsibility lies with manufacturing facility during or before final boxing of the iPad, which says a little of quality assurance and control in this case. That is, I do not blame Amazon nor the seller for the problem in this particular case (first time ever).That aside, the new iPad is working nicely and has a great retina display (colors, graphics, resolution...) and great speed. But I still will not give it the fourth and fifth stars, because contrary to what I'm used, and expect, to get from Apple products, this one didn't have that mint condition look that I expected from and Apple's new item. Instead of going trough the process of returning with all the time delay and implications (customs in my country for once)I installed a anti-glare/mate screen protector to \"hide\" the scratch, which somehow defeats the purpose of the great retina displayIMPORTANT UPDATE: IOS 7 have a feature that cannot be turned of, which verifies that the Lightning connector is certified by Apple, and as soon as I update to IOS 7, and connected my iPad to be charged with the Lightning connector that came with the iPad in the original, brand new, sealed and unopened factory box I got a pop up display that stated that my iPad connector isn't certified and my not function properly with my iPad. I reported this to apple via chat support and the agent told me, after running an online diagnostic, that my device and connectors were new and that it was a glitch in the IOS 7 verifying routine that would be fixed on a next release (update of IOS 7), so I dismissed (every time) the message and charged my iPad without problems. But that was until today, after connecting the new iPad with the supposedly original Apple lightning connector and receiving the  warning message, the iPad stop charging after reaching 27% charge. Beware, either don't buy this model or wait until Apple issues some kind of correction or update removing that verifying routine from IOS 7. Right now for me, living outside the US this is a disaster, returning the device, for me is not an option. So I will have to take my iPad to a Venezuelan authorized service center, testing and probably buying a new \"original\" lightning connector, cause if I buy the Apple care plan in the US It won't be applicable in my country.", "Date": "August 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "A welcome upgrade", "Author": "Matthew P.

I NEVER work on it. I mean I can check email and all of that but it's just not a laptop. I should have passed on this and gotten one of the thin little laptops instead.Also if you get one, get some kind of warranty and get a cover for it before it even arrives. It's more fragile than the iphone. I did not have a cover on my iphone when I first got it and dropped it a few times and it was fine. I was in the process of looking for a cover for this ipad and dropped it and the screen cracked. It's going to cost me at least $160 to get a new screen. The more protected it is the more places you will take it and the more use you will get out of it.

They had it in stock, so I was thrilled with the fact that I could walk out of the store on my lunch break with a fully functioning new iPad.  I'm a sucker for picking things up in person, unless it means waiting on a line with people who think they are 'making history' with their purchase, in which case I just have it shipped to me at home or work, most likely from Amazon.This is my first iPad.  I held off on buying one because I'm a film geek and wanted a full HD display.  When Apple came out with the Retina Display, I thought, \"That's great, but with a maximum of 64GB it's still just a toy.  I need at least 120GB.\"  And then they came out with a 128GB model plus a better port and it was time to buy.  All my friends who rushed to buy the first iPad, the iPad 2, and 'The New iPad' as the 3rd generation model was called were definitely jealous; but more important for me was that I got exactly what I wanted.In fact I was so happy with getting exactly what I wanted that when the iPad Air came out, a little faster and lighter than the one I bought, it didn't make a difference to me.  Sure, I'm looking forward to when Apple comes out with what I predict will be a larger, more powerful, fully functioning computer in iPad form--and I'm predicting it will be called the iPad Pro--but even then I'll probably wait until at least the next generation of that model before buying it unless it features the ability to use Final Cut Pro (which no current iPad can do).Will you regret buying this one instead of the iPad Air or waiting for the next model?  I don't think so.  First thing, it's nearly as powerful as the iPad Air, and if you wait for the next model you're going to pay top dollar.  If you wait for the price to drop, then you're going to want the model after that.  And the cycle of suffering on this matter is endless.When you're ready to buy, then buy.  Buy the one you want.  This one versus the Air, personally I think the only significant difference is price, that you're not missing something.

Safari is an wasting Internet browser to use and, while you can't customize settings as much as a laptop computer, it has excellent malware protection and is set up very conveniently for the casual browser. It's a good weight too. While shopping for my tablet, I've looked at and held many other brands. A common problem (for me) is that a lot of them felt too light for their size. This is probably because apple uses aluminum for the back cover of their tablet instead of plastic. It feels sturdy, and that's a good thing when it comes to durability. Another excellent apple quality? The apps! I know, other tablets have apps too, but apple has kind of cornered the market on app production. Most of what you can find on an android or kindle tablet, you can find in the apple store (and then some). See an app not available through apple? Probably a good thing! I've learned that Apple screens all of their apps before putting it up in the store. This means that there are no major malware problems. There are some disadvantages of course: 1- you have to buy directly from apple as they do have monopoly on their stuff and a lot of imitation items are suspect (this can get pricey), 2- you can't really open two screens the way you can simultaneously on other devices. This is not to say that you can't have two (or more) things running at once, but you have to switch entirely between them and can't view both on the screen at once. 3- there are many conveniently pre-downloaded onto other tablets that are very useful for students and office work. You can get a lot of those same apps through the apple store, but many of the better ones are not free and you have to pick and choose your way through quite a few applications.There are probably more then 3, but these are the ones that stood out to me. Overall though, PROs totally outweigh the CONs, making this tablet just plain awesome!

Just like my relationship with my smartphone, don't leave home without it.  Crystal clear on graphics.  Of course, this is my first ipad so I cannot really compare it on past experience.  Tons of apps, batteries lasts ok.  100% can last for about a day (I actually used it for about an hour every hour, and by about 9-930 pm, battery was at 15%.  Again, depending on what you are doing, it lasted me for about 2 more hours (I think).Price was great!  Seller was AWESOME (they actually gave me a cover for this ipad as a token of appreciation for the business).  However, with that being said, if you have kids that always run around, MAKE SURE TO INVEST on a more \"military\" style case.  If you call Apple, the only thing that they could suggest was..., well sir, just buy a new one??!?  (yeah, like I have $500 bucks, spewing out from my pockets.  My response; okay let me go to my money tree and pick some bills out, goodbye!  If you go to an electronics store, make sure to have at least $200 laying around.  I broke/cracked my screen after 2 weeks!  So needless to say, a case with something covering the actual screen, yes it is a must!

Another plus is it connects to the 5GHz band of my dual band router and rarely has a buffer problem.Apples constant upgrades every few months is a turn off to me and this will be a one time buy - same reason I bought two 3GS phones, runs the new software at a half the price of a new phone every few months.
