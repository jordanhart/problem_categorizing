{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A Step Closer", "Author": "Craig Whisenhunt", "ReviewID": "R3MU84B6T9NYD7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For anyone out there who is considering whether or not to make the leap and purchase the iPad 2, this review is for you. If you're still debating between the iPad 1 and the iPad 2 check out my review of the first generation iPad right here on Amazon to see a discussion of its strengths and weaknesses with a number of people commenting (both positively and negatively) over the past 11 months.Let me begin by saying this upfront, I don't work for Apple, I don't own Apple Stock, and whether you buy an iPad, Xoom, a laptop or a pad of paper and pencil I don't get anything for writing this. I'm not an Apple \"fanboy\" although I can give credit where credit is due and lately Apple has deserved a lot of credit for some of their products.Physical CharacteristicsThe iPad 2 is absurdly thin. More importantly than it's thinness is its tapered edge which feels more natural in your hand. One of the biggest complaints about the original iPad was it really wasn't tremendously comfortable to hold for long periods at a time. For a tablet device designed to be held, that's a pretty big deal. Apple really has done an amazing job of cramming everything into an even smaller space than before and the difference is really noticeable when you're holding the device. In addition to the tapered edge, Apple managed to reduce the overall weight of the iPad 2. That might not seem like a huge deal to most, especially when you consider the weight difference isn't tremendous when you're already under 2 pounds, but I spend a good part of my day holding the iPad in my hands and the weight difference is surprising by the end of the day. The first generation isn't heavy by any means, but the iPad 2 outshines it.New and \"Improved\"Apple doubled the RAM in the iPad 2 from 256MB to 512MB. What does that mean? For most casual users, probably not a whole lot. There is a performance bump that everyone will see the effects of in things like loading times for webpages that are open in the background, but 256MB was sufficient for most daily use and games. If you're planning to use your device for some of the more graphically intense games the iPad 2 does offer a better method of graphics processing that'll help deliver faster images with fewer jerky movements. If you're just playing Angry birds and reading e-mail you're not going to know the difference.The screen is the same for all real purposes. It is technically a \"new\" part in that it isn't identical to the old, it's a bit thinner and more efficient, but it's the same resolution. The Glass is thinner though, and this amounts to a fair bit of the weight loss from one generation to the next. In playing with the device it seems surprising but despite feeling lighter it actually feels more sturdy in your hands. I still wouldn't suggest dropping it, but if it were to fall the iPad 2 certainly feels like it might stand a better chance to survive. Try not to drop it though.The addition of 2 cameras was expected. Some were a bit surprised to see the first generation released without the cameras. Whether it was for a price point consideration, or a means to get people to upgrade, Apple held off until iPad 2. The cameras do a reasonable job, but they're not going to replace a dedicated digital camera, or really even the camera on your phone for most still images. The cameras do a substantially better job with video, and FaceTime is probably one of the best reasons to get the iPad 2 over the original iPad. For those who might not be familiar, FaceTime is Apple's face to face conferencing system, kind of like Skype, or if you'd rather, kind of like the Jetson's TV/Phone. With the push of a button you can be having a face to face chat with a loved one just about anywhere in the world (provided they're on a wireless network at the time). FaceTime doesn't work over 3G natively (it can be used over a wifi connection created by a 3G device however) so you're not going to be able to use it in your car anytime soon. This is probably a good thing though. It is incredibly easy to use and if you know other people with an iPad 2, iPhone 4, or Mac it's a lot of fun.Smart Covers aren't really \"smart\" but they're really very useful. Not only do they provide a stylistic enhancement of the device, but they serve a practical and functional purpose of doubling as a screen protector and stand in 2 configurations. You can find them in a variety of colors and from third market suppliers, and it's a safe bet that more will be out soon to capitalize on the magnetic sensors in the iPad 2. It's unfortunate that this same feature can't somehow be retrofitted to the iPad 1, I wouldn't have thought a case would be a compelling reason to consider a product over it's competitor, but these covers are really so useful it's hard to understand why they've not been there since the beginning.Multitasking SupportOne of the biggest knocks against the iPad when first released was the lack of native multi-tasking support. Jailbreakers added the feature quickly and Apple soon realized it would be a requirement for any future device's success and released an OS update that included the feature. The iPad 2 capitalizes on that progress and takes it a step further with the increased RAM enabling more open applications to be suspended at once, and the time to open or close an application has improved as well. That said, even the first generation managed to open and close apps faster than most people would be used to on their computers, so while this is an improvement it's more akin to showing off.AppsOne thing that Apple has clearly the advantage in for the moment is app availability. The App store has close to 70,000 iPad specific Apps, all of which will work on the iPad 2. The new cameras will undoubtedly see this list expand rapidly, as will the inclusion of a gyroscope for gaming and motion based uses. There are also a substantial number of professional applications ranging from document creation to photo editing and vector drawing. Chances are if you can dream it, there's an App for that (and if not you might want to get started on one to fill in the gap). The Android market is making a strong showing, and ultimately it'll likely be a strong competitor, for now it still has a ways to go, but any potential buyer should consider the strength of the application market before buying a tablet.Pros:Weight. Seriously. The minimal weight of this thing is by far the most impressive feature about it in my opinion. It seems to defy physics and logic that so much could be in such a small space working that hard for that long.Battery Life. From full to dead my iPad 2 went just over 11 hours with the movie Robin Hood showing twice during that time, the screen at half brightness, wifi turned on, an Angry Birds marathon and a good portion of a book in ibook. That's better than a work day and that's constantly on.Books. This is definitely a Pro, but reading itself could go either way. The great benefit to the iPad is having access to Google Books, ibook, Nook, and Kindle. This allows for some comparison shopping and price competition (although for the most part they're all usually about the same). Reading in the evenings in bed is great as the back light means you don't have to worry about keeping others awake, but the glass screen causes some glare trouble when trying to read outside or near a sunny window. If you're an avid outdoor reader the Kindle might still be your best bet.Cons:Still no dedicated USB support. While there is a camera add-on that allows for certain USB devices to be used there is no option for mass storage. Some of the Android Tablets allow for this and if you find yourself wanting to use your tablet as a standalone storage device this might be something to consider. The device can read from certain flash drives though, but is largely limited to photo and video files. Jailbreaks offer solutions to this, but those come with their own issues as well.Still no dedicated SD card slot. This is troublesome on two fronts. First, if you want to import pictures from your camera you have to have an adapter which is just one more thing to carry around. Second, the lack of expansion means you're limited to what you purchase in terms of storage. I purchased a 32GB iPad last time and never filled it up completely, so for me capacity wasn't an issue. If you want to be able to have your entire movie collection with you though... you may want to consider whether the iPad 2 can meet your space requirements.HDMI output. Really this is a Pro and a Con. The iPad does allow for HD output over HDMI but again it requires an adapter. All of these adapters are additional purchases for features that some tablets offer built in. This can be a pain, but then again if you're not likely to ever use HDMI Output then you're not paying for something you won't use.No Flash Support. This is becoming less and less of an issue as the internet and web developers are moving away from Flash for many websites, but there are a lot still out there relying on Adobe's Flash to run properly (including a lot of web based games). Before you pick a tablet consider what kind of websites you frequent and try and determine if they are Flash driven or not. If they are you may really want to consider something from the Android offerings as it is expected that they'll have at least some Flash support.If you're in the market for a tablet device the iPad 2 should definitely be on your short list. If you're uncertain it is always best to go and play with these things hands on first if you can. Best Buy is a good place for that, so are Verizon Stores since they have the Xoom and 3G iPad. Don't get pulled into the hype and mania that comes with an Apple release. They're exciting and new, and they're impressive enough to warrant some excitement, but it will die down and there will be other products that prove a strong competitor to the iPad 2. If you're looking for right now though, this is probably your best bet. I gave the device 4 stars, as I did the iPad 1. I did this in contemplation of the features offered by competitors that are absent from the iPad, most notably the requirement for adapters for USB/SD/HDMI. While these features are there, they aren't as convenient as in other tablets. With that in mind I firmly believe that the iPad more than makes up for this in usability, reliability, and design and in those areas far exceeds its current competitors.", "Date": "March 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "iPad pros and cons", "Author": "Larry J. Crockett", "ReviewID": "R4VCE1TBRME86", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "People need to be aware that the reviews you see for the iPad often reflect the old Mac/PC platform wars with some people making comments who simply don't like iPads from a distance, without actually owning one, because they see it as part of the deplorable Apple mania they find so distasteful.  They're entitled to their opinion, of course, but it is unfortunate they skew the evaluation of this product without the deep acquaintance one needs in order to give it an insightful evaluation.I have taught computer science at the college level for 26 years and have had computers with all kinds of operating systems. I don't own Apple stock and have never known anyone who works at Apple. I therefore have no connection to Apple.I have had my iPad for about a month and read a fair number of reviews before I purchased, spent some time using one at the store, and thought about what I might use one for, in contrast to my laptop with which I am well satisfied. People too often think of computers in terms of hardware, the specs and looks, instead of the software and the functionality.  You should ask yourself, \"What will I use this for that solves a problem I would like to have solved?\"  Software is always more important than hardware, even though it is the hardware that makes an impression.The iPad is not a laptop and is not principally a production computer, that is, a computer on which you are going to develop web pages, do serious graphics editing, or write a book.  You could use your new Taurus to tow a trailer, but that is not what it is designed to do well. These things can increasingly be done on an iPad, but I don't believe they will ever be what it is best at.  It is a portable media machine with an inviting touch interface that requires a somewhat different set of skills, which take a modest amount of time to learn.  Surfing the web, checking email, watching movies, playing games, looking at new cars, reading the Economist magazine, all work better on an iPad than a laptop.  It does these things very well indeed. There are now 80,000 apps for a wide variety of activities--given its design intent.  The apps are either free or reasonably priced, so you can get a bunch from the \"app store\" for little investment. As with Amazon, you can see what other people think of an app before getting one.This would be a splendid acquisition for small children, for teens deep into social networking, for an adult wanting to drop into the love seat for a quick look at what is happening in the world, for a senior citizen who wants a simple, inviting system with few hassles, to stay in touch with grandchildren.  The iPad is not a light laptop; it is instead a different way to use computing to do a wide variety of consumption and communication--not principally production.In my experience, its wi-fi is adroit from one environment to another.  It \"knows\" where it is geographically, scans its environment for wi-fi, and accesses wi-fi seamlessly.  At this point in time, we should expect no less.  I cannot address the 3G communications since I have a wi-fi only (I am not convinced of the value of the 3G and I can use my phone as a hotspot).  I have never had it crash, though I have had to back myself out of apps that seemed to have no logical next step.  This was the result either of my ignorance or the fact that there is less of a standard user interface from app to app than there is in classical GUIs such as OS X and Windows.For the laptop lugging road-warrior, it should be noted, this is not going to be a full replacement.  I now take my laptop and my iPad when I go into the college.  But much of the time there, I use my iPad because it is so light, convenient and useable. I use it to teach my classes and often reference traditional texts from the iPad instead of lugging them along to class. I develop my own web pages on my 27\" desktop which is the right environment for such development; I wouldn't expect to do that on an iPad.  In education (and evidently in medicine), it is proving to be a real boon.  The enterprise situations where portable information access and transmission are critical will find this a compelling solution.  The heavy Photoshop user or music track editor will still need a conventional computer, either laptop or desktop.I purchased the 64GB version, which may be more storage than I need. But since it will drive my 50\" screen downstairs I figured I would begin to load lots of pictures and favored music, so it may prove a wise choice in the long run.  It can swallow up entire evenings with the music-augmented slide shows it can do. In fact, you may begin to wonder if you need cable TV.  Conventional content providers should be worried about the iPad since it provides yet another way for the user to determine viewing experience. But if you are still drawn to cable, it makes a fine remote control.Before people evaluate this new kind of computing, they need to spend a month or so with it to identify what it does well and what would be better left to other kinds of computing solutions. I fear some of the evaluations here (both glowing and critical) are not well informed and so do not serve the readers well.  So read these reviews with a critical eye.October 18 2011 Update:I continue to find my iPad remarkably productive and productive in ways I would not have anticipated. It does indeed redefine how we can use computing so that it does the work we want to do with minimal impediments.  I now leave my laptop at school and take my iPad back and forth since 80 or 90% of the time the iPad does all I need to do.  I use it 3 or 4 hours a day.I just ordered my wife an 11\" MacBook Air with the larger RAM and storage, which might seem to contradict what I said in my review.  I don't believe it does for the following reasons. She needs to do serious editing of Word documents for the volunteer work she does for the college and still wants the joys of a 2-pound piece of elegant hardware. She is an excellent typist and likes the feel of the Air's keyboard. A keyboard can be added to an iPad, but it's a kludgy add-on that compromises the point of the iPad: an ultra-light slim, touch-interface device that does most of what traditional computing does without the impediments of mouse and keyboard and weight.  The 11\" Air is a gem of engineering with many of the advantages of the iPad but it is more capable of the production I spoke of in my review since it is a full OS X Lion machine--so it is fully capable of running traditional production software such as Word or Photoshop or, for that matter, Windows.The Air and the iPad illustrate the difference between a consumption device (iPad) and a production device (Air).  Much of what is appealing in the iPad can be had in the Air, but at the cost of an additional several hundred dollars. It's not the solution I want since I don't want the keyboard getting in the way when I want to curl up with a consumption device in my favorite love seat or use it to assist my teaching in class.  My wife prefers the Air since email and other typing-intensive production activities are so important to her. In a word, the iPad is distilled essence of computationally assisted consumption.I guess we will give the phrase \"mixed marriage\" new meaning!", "Date": "April 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "It's cool, but has its flaws - and do you really need one?", "Author": "J. Harvey", "ReviewID": "R1YNKZ8Y1IOMEJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First things first: I consider myself relatively unbiased on Apple products. I received the original iPad as a gift (which I was able to return once I saw the iPad 2 announcement) and I have an old iPod 4th gen with color display which is still going strong after a few years, but aside from that I typically use Windows PCs and my phone is Android.If you don't have an iPad, and you're trying to decide whether you want one or not, ask yourself: What will I use this for?This is meant to be an overview for the uninitiated, since according to initial news reports, 70% of people who have bought the iPad 2 so far didn't own an original iPad.Advantages:If you want it for web surfing, a portable Netflix or other video screen, gaming, or FaceTime/Skype video chat, it's definitely adept at all of those things. I used to read books and magazines in my bed before going to sleep, and I still occasionally do, but now I've found that surfing with the iPad is just as convenient and relaxing.The iPad is all about the apps, many of which greatly expand the native capability of the iPad. You can get Microsoft Office clones, remote desktop, second screen, calculators, alarm clocks, remote apps for cable boxes and disc players, and more. Some are free, many are not. I'll get into some of those a bit later, but keep in mind this isn't intended to be a review of apps. If you want to see what's out there, you can search the App store on the web or in iTunes. If you expect the iPad to be able to do something not in its specs, check the app store first.The only difference I've seen with the iPad 2 is that now there are a few games out there that are optimized for iPad 2, or have improved iPad 2 modes. Lots of games are free and those that aren't occasionally go on sale. The only two I've bought are Scrabble HD and Dungeon Hunter 2 HD, both when they were $1 each. (I've played many more free ones.) I recommend both. Dungeon Hunter 2 HD is a great 3D game that tries really hard to be Diablo 2, with character classes, customization, and online play. It looks great and has never crashed or had a framerate stutter. The iPad 1 had problems with crashing and low framerates with games occasionally, and this version seems to be a much better gaming system. That's the only big difference I noticed between the iPad 1 and iPad 2 so far though.For me, having a huge array of apps to play with, many of which are free if you don't mind ads here and there, and the convenience of being able to web surf without having to drag out my laptop makes this worth having. Plus the battery gets 8-10 hours on a charge, which is a far cry better than any laptop I know of. It's a great e-reader for airplane travel, even really long flights, though you can't use it on take-off and landing of course.Wi-Fi performance is flawless and the range is excellent. More than once I've pulled up in the driveway and before I'm even in the house, I've heard my iPad's ESPN ScoreCenter app go off to inform me of a score. I can't speak to the 3G quality, though, as I don't have that model. Frankly, I don't think most people need it. If I'm out of the middle of nowhere and need the web for something, I'd much rather pull out my phone than the iPad. If you just have to use the iPad, tons of public places have Wi-Fi these days.If you want to be able to print things, you might think at first that you need an AirPrint compatible printer. Fear not! A simple Google search for \"AirPrint any printer\" will show you how to configure your PC or Mac to broadcast its printers with AirPrint. I have Brother and Canon printers and they both worked with it. It took some time to download and install the AirPrint service and then configure printer sharing options on my network, but that was a far cry better than buying a new printer or an expensive printing app! Still, I've found that my printers occasionally disappear from the list, and the only way to get them back is to shut the iPad down completely and power it back on. Annoying.Limitations:The iPad 2 still doesn't support Adobe Flash. Some websites are adapting to this and adding HTML 5 video. Many aren't. Keep that in mind if you're a heavy web video user. I love to watch web shows like the Nostalgia Critic and the Angry Video Game Nerd, and most web show hosting sites are still in Flash. Also, some sites have flash menus, making them completely unusable to you if they don't have a mobile version. It's this that prevents the iPad from being a true laptop replacement, regardless of how much you spend on apps. I still end up having to fire up the laptop to use several websites I enjoy.The screen is supposedly oleophobic but gets fingerprints all over the place in mere minutes of use. I find that extremely irritating. If you feel the same way, get a screen protector like the ZAGG InvisibleShield (though if you get that particular one, be VERY careful when you install it, it's extremely difficult to get it on there with no air bubbles). You will thank yourself when all it takes to clear fingerprints is one wipe, plus it protects from scratches to boot. To get fingerprints off the screen itself took vigorous scrubbing and left streaks, which needed isopropyl alcohol to remove. Also, in direct sunlight, the glare off the screen makes it hard to see. Add fingerprints to that and it's practically impossible.Although the iPad 2 has two cameras, one on the front and one on the back, I haven't found much reason to use them other than for video chat. The cameras are terrible quality and the iPad 2 just isn't portable enough to drag around everywhere for camera usage. You can get an excellent digital camera for $150 or less, and most smartphones have much better cameras than the iPad has. Use one of those instead.If you don't own a laptop, don't expect the iPad 2 to do everything a laptop will, especially if you plan on doing any work-related things. Office applications are not included. Pages, Numbers, and Keynote, which are like Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint respectively, are available for $10 each. I don't own them, but apparently they work reasonably well. However they are not 100% compatible with Microsoft Office documents, especially if you have more complicated formatting, macros, or animations that don't translate directly. Plus, the virtual keyboard is a bit more tiring to type on and definitely hinders typing speed. I average about 45-50 WPM on it, where I can get 80-100 WPM on a normal keyboard. You can be a little lazy with it to increase your effective typing speed, though; you can leave out apostrophes or required capitalization and the iPad will nearly always fix it. That also mostly takes care of my fingers occasionally hitting the wrong keys due to the lack of tactile feedback, but I still end up having to go back and fix words sometimes. Also, sometimes it fixes things that don't need to be fixed. It always seems to correct \"its\" to \"it's\", but what if I mean \"its\"? I know the difference!A lot of other features that you would expect a laptop to have are not here, though, or cost more. For example...- You can give slideshow presentations or display video on external monitors, projectors, or TVs with it, but that will cost you $29 for a VGA adapter plus the price of a cable and DVI to VGA adapter (monitors or projectors), or $39 for an HDMI adapter plus the price of an HDMI cable (newer TVs), or $39 for a composite or component video cable (older TVs)- You can transfer photos from a camera directly without having to use iTunes, but that will cost $29 for a camera adapter kit- The iPad is terrible at file storage for things other than music, videos, photos and apps, and with no USB or SD card slot, can't easily use external storage. If you want to store documents or need external storage for anything you'll need a file management app to keep track of them, and an online cloud file storage service like MobileMe (expensive) or Dropbox (free but limited to 2 GB, or pay for more)- Where you can just close a laptop to protect its screen, you'll need a case to protect the iPad. I highly recommend getting one. To save some money, try a cover/case intended for iPad 1, assuming you don't care that the rear camera will be covered up. A lot of them still fit and work great, such as the Griffin Elan Passport for iPad - Black, and since they're for an old model they'll be discounted- You can watch videos/TV episodes/movies on it, but unless you bought them in iTunes, it's a big fat pain to find a converter for them and transfer them to iTunes. This is especially annoying for DVDs/Blu-Rays that have digital copy. You've already paid for the movie and have a digital file but you can't transfer it to your iPad without having to jump through a ton of hoops or buying expensive programs or apps! Not all media companies have this problem, though. When you redeem a digital copy from Disney, you can choose to get an iTunes version, which is perfectly compatible with the iPad. I have Up, Toy Story 3 and Wall-E, and getting them on the iPad was hassle-free. Conversely, Warner Brothers only offers Windows Media versions of the Harry Potter series for digital copy. Transferring to iPad is possible but you need to find programs that remove the DRM, resize to iPad resolution, and convert to Quicktime format. Good luck with that.Despite all that, the iPad 2 is worth getting if you can spare the cash, and more importantly, if you anticipate actually using it. I don't think it's worth getting for games alone, but if you're a gamer, there are lots of great, cheap games out there. Many of them are even multiplayer, though I haven't tried it, since most of my friends don't have iPads and interoperability between iPad and iPhone versions of games is slim to none (board games like Scrabble and Carcassonne tend to support iPad/iPhone interoperability though).The thing is, though, I got this as a gift. Would I have gotten it if I actually had to plunk down the $500+? Honestly, probably not. The lack of many features without having to buy expensive apps and accessories is a real deal-breaker for me (and subtracts a star from my rating). Plus, though I understand why Apple doesn't like Adobe Flash, they really need to get over it since there are large parts of the web that don't work without it. It may be bad for battery life, but why not just have the option to turn it on and off as needed, then? Still, if money is no object for you, it's a slick, entertaining device, and you'll enjoy it quite a bit. Just don't expect it to replace anything you already have; the iPad is in a niche market that the iPad itself created.", "Date": "March 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Comparison of my IPad 2 with my Xoom", "Author": "A", "ReviewID": "R3RXN27YVJW4VK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have purchased both an iPad2 and Xoom for different family members.  I thought it worth comparing the two devices for anyone interested.  Many of my comments are subjective so bear that in mind when reading the review.External appearance and feel:The iPad2 screen has a different feel from the Xoom screen - the iPad2 is a bit slicker, less likely to stick when moving short distances.  The screen on the Xoom tends to show fingerprints more than the Ipad2 for some reason. Everyone in this family thinks that the iPad2 looks sharper than the Xoom.Both weigh 1.6 lbs.  Subjectively, the Xoom feels heavier than the Ipad2, but it's an illusion perhaps caused by it's slightly smaller size.  UPDATE:  I need to learn to use the scales - the Xoom is about 3 ounces heavier than the iPad2.Both have a similar size screen, measured diagonally.  But the aspect ratio is different - 4:3 for iPad2, 16:9 for Xoom.  This means that the iPad2 actually has a larger viewing area, and this makes a real difference when scrolling through a web site.  The iPad2 screen is brighter than the Xoom screen.Hardware performance:The Xoom feels a bit faster than the iPad2, and the specs show that it is faster.  Both have dual core processors based on ARM designs.  The Xoom seems to be able to handle graphics better than the iPad2.  As far as connecting to Wifi networks, both seem to have this one down pat - they both just work.User Interface:The iPad2 is just like a big iPhone.  Whether this good or bad is subjective.  For me, it's good - polished, flexible and can be customized to my needs.  The Xoom user interface is totally new, and unfortunately it shows - there are many rough edges.  Some examples: moving icons around to group programs together is not intuitive and they keep moving back; you can see the first 5 applications running on the Xoom and select one, but the list doesn't scroll so applications that don't show in the list can't be selected; you can't close applications (except by a force quit that can lose data) as the Xoom decides when to quit an application; customization is possible but more difficult than the iPad2.  In short, the Xoom user interface is a work in progress - great potential but currently quite flawed.Operating System:The iPad2 uses Apple's IOS.  It works, but it uses cooperative multitasking which (in theory) is less effective than the full multitasking on the Xoom which uses a version of Google's Android designed for tablets.  In practice, they both work fine and I doubt anyone would notice the difference.Applications:iPad2 has 70,000 apps available from the Apple App store and it also runs the 300,000 apps available for the iPhone.  Xoom currently has around 60 apps and it can run Android phone apps (but they are stretched in one direction which makes them look strange).  Some of the iPad2 applications are pretty impressive - GarageBand for example.  There are many games on the iPad2, and just a few games made for the Xoom.  If this doesn't improve quickly, the Xoom is sunk.  After all, applications are generally the reason people buy these devices.Browsing:Because of the screen aspect ratio that I mentioned, I prefer browsing on the iPad2.  The Xoom has Adobe Flash and the iPad2 doesn't, but so far I haven't come across a single instance where this has been an issue.  I'm sure there are very many sites not compatible with iPad2, but I haven't browsed to one of them yet.Camera:I don't use the camera much, and I'm not really sure if either is better.  In the family, the Xoom owner says the Xoom is better, the iPad2 owner says the iPad2.  The Xoom has flash and iPad2 doesn't which is a win for Xoom, but the Xoom seems slower to take a picture.Speakers:The Xoom has two small speakers, iPad2 has one slightly larger speaker.  The sound is somewhat better quality on the iPad2 and the Xoom cannot achieve the same volume as the iPad2.  But they are both pretty poor - use earphones or an external speaker if you want decent audio.Battery life:Difficult for me to give an exact comparison, but based on family usage it seems the iPad2 has the edge here, but not by much.Internal storage:The Xoom has 1GB of RAM and 32 GB of flash storage.  The iPad2 has 512MB of RAM and 16GB, 32GB or 64GB of flash storage - I bought the 64GB model.External storage:The Xoom has an external card slot that supports SD cards, but the software was not ready in time for the product release.  The slot is inoperative until Motorola releases an operating system update.  The iPad2 has no external storage support.User Experience:The iPad2 was up and running quite quickly.  I connected the device to iTunes and it automatically updated to the latest version of the operating system.  I was then able to select and download Apps immediately and start using them.The Xoom was not so easy.  For some reason, I was not able to install the latest version of Google Maps or Adobe Flash.  I was able to download the apps, and the install process appeared to work without errors, but the new apps just were not installed.  After some time trying I finally returned the Xoom back to the factory settings and started again, and this time both the installs worked.  Of course, this wouldn't be a good solution if you had a ton of applications and/or data on the device.Support:Apple has their retail stores.  You can get a huge amount of help from these stores from people whose only job is to support users.  Both iPad2 and Xoom users have web sites available that support their products but you have to spend the time digging for the sites and digging through the sites.  You can also purchase an Applecare support package which gives you a couple of years extra support for the iPad2.Bottom line:I believe the Xoom hardware may be slightly better than the iPad2 (apart from the screen aspect ratio and the speakers), but the software is terribly lacking.  The Xoom was released FAR too early, it's just not ready for primetime.If I had to pick just one, I'd pick the iPad2 - less hassle, apps for everything, better browsing experience, better support options.  The Xoom needs less buggy software and more applications; it has potential but it's not there yet.  And by the time it gets there, there will be something better available.Update 7/5/2011We have now had the two devices for over 3 months.  During that time Motorola released an update to fix some of the issues with the original Xoom.  It's somewhat faster, the problem of only seeing the first 5 applications is fixed, there are some extra capabilities for USB, and most importantly, the Xoom doesn't crash every few hours.However, the biggest issue with the Xoom is still the number of applications available to run in native tablet mode, as opposed to running Android phone applications.  I've read that there are 300 applications available, but it's hard to find them.  The Android Market doesn't distinguish between phone applications designed for a small screen  and tablet applications.  You have to read the description of each application to see what it is designed to run on, and finding 300 apps in 200,000 is very time consuming.  Apple claims to have 100,000 iPad specific apps in their store.Another problem with the Android Market is the complete lack of supervision.  I understand that anybody can put any application there without any review, and I've read there have been a few problems with malware.  Recently I saw an article that claimed there are spyware applications on the store, which worries me a little.  I'm not saying you can't get malware from the Apple store, but Apple does look at the apps first - I'm not aware of any malware getting into the Apple store.The iPad2 does have some downsides I wasn't aware of when I wrote my review.  It would be nice to have a general purpose USB connection and a card slot.  There is an extra-cost adapter available from Apple that supplies HDMI out and a limited function USB connector.  Also the keyboard attachment made for the original iPad doesn't work on the iPad2.For us, the iPad2 is the winner.  The Xoom is sitting on a shelf and I don't think it's been used over a week now.  In contrast, iPad2 is in use every day and continues to be a big hit.  The primary problem with the Xoom is the lack of tablet-based applications.Update 7/7/2011The Xoom has been sold to a colleague who wants an Android tablet.  I think the Xoom is better than most of the Android tablets currently available.  However, the Honeycomb software feels so unfinished, and the paucity of available tablet-based applications was a major issue.  I lost several hundred dollars on the sale, but nobody wanted to use it and there was no point in letting it lay around unused.  I'm already under some pressure to buy another iPad2, but I want to wait to see if the rumors of another iPad version in September are true.", "Date": "April 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Went from \"why do I need it\" to \"Can't live without it\"", "Author": "C. A. Sinclair \"doctorcreation\"", "ReviewID": "R1FENBQH0LHSET", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "SUMMARY: White iPad 2 64GB Wifi-onlyA really wonderful electronic device for media consumption with some moderate content creation potential. This will likely change as more apps focused on content generation are created.  I find myself using it more and more simply because it is \"always ready\" and small enough that it is always near. If this device had a better file management system and a more robust way to share printers it would have gotten 5 out of 5 stars. As it is, the iPad 2 is a solid 4 star device.DELIGHTERS (Current features that exceeded my expectations)FORM FACTOR: Thin and comfortable to hold. Small enough to toss in a bag or carry around the house so you find yourself using rather than trying to \"remember\" to do \"that thing\" the next time you're at your computer. Still has some weight to it (1.3lb) so prolonged reading in certain positions will cause fatigue.APP ENVIRONMENT: Really excellent variety and quality of applications for a broad range of uses and a broad range of prices. Also plays nice with content providers like amazon kindle, Google docs, and lots of news outlets.SLEEP MODE: It is seemingly \"always ready\" as it wakes from sleep very quickly.HDMI OUT: Granted there is a $40 accessory required it is nice to have the option of showing what's on your iPad 2 to a larger audience.iOS: Overall the operating system is \"cleanly\" designed, features are easy to navigate and find.PROCESSING SPEED: Remarkably quick to load apps, web pages, pdfs, etc.SATISFIERS (Current features that met my expectation)HOMESHARING: Being able to share my iTunes library (music, movies, podcast, etc)  across my wifi network is wonderful and saves space on the iPad 2.SCREEN: Bright, good touch sensitivity, \"flips\" between orientations well, handles pictures and text with aplomb.PRICE: Reasonable considering the competition but nearly high enough to justify a \"real\" laptopAUDIO: Speaker is quite good for a handheld device, placement in portrait mode ends up in your lap but you can invert the iPad so not a huge deal. Also speaker faces rear of device instead of forward meaning you need to crank it louder than maybe otherwise necessary if it were forward facing.BATTERY LIFE: Battery holds up well even after a day of heavy usage, charges up easily over night. Can go 2-3 days without charging with moderate to light usage)WIFI: This simply \"works\". turn it on, detect a signal, and go. No messing around with complicated network settings.ONSCREEN KEYBOARD: Its responsive and surprisingly easy to use. However, scrolling to a separate numbers keyboard and lack of a \"tab\" button really disrupts workflow.DISSATISFIERS (Current features that did not meet my expectations)FILE MANAGEMENT: File management on the iPad is Byzantine. You use iTunes to \"attach\" files to apps or email them?PRINTING: Unless you have an AirPrint capable printer (new hardware to buy) or one of a handful other printers you will need to use the atrocious \"file management\" system above to get the docs on you computer to print. Double whammy of pain!CAMERAS: The two cameras are adequate for video chatting but taking stills is a joke. True I wouldn't want to shoot a lot of birthdays holding an iPad but I would like to use a program like \"GeniusScan\" to photograph documents for later reference. The 0.7Megapixel camera is capable of \"barely legible\" documents.COST PER GB: Paying >$3 per GB ($100 more for 64GB than 32GB) is nearly twice what you'd pay per GB for the difference in a stand-alone USB thumbdrive.TOUCH NAVIGATION: Ok so this is a general criticism of any touch device and there is no way to get around it really. Having \"grown up\" using keyboards and mice to interface with computers I am having to learn how to do tasks differently. Press-Hold, Swipe, Two vs Three fingers. All for tasks I was so used to doing with a Tab or Right-click.WISHLIST (features I'd like to see in the next-gen iPad)Touchscreen: The capacitive screen works fine for many things but writing notes with a \"fat\" stylus isn't one of them. Having a touch screen that doesn't require the \"fat\" stylus would greatly improve handwriting and note taking.USB or SD Card ports (never gonna happen as Apple uses memory as a price differentiator but it doesn't hurt to dream)Retina displayInfrared receiver/transmitter (Can anyone say universal remote!)GPSCheaper 3G antenna: $130 bucks extra for a 3G receiver plus I gotta buy a plan? ugh.Smartcover: Would like to see this included in the price of the device", "Date": "April 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "A few things that haven't been covered...", "Author": "Expert Reviewer", "ReviewID": "R1HDDISACYGGRC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're considering a tablet, the only rational choice is the iPad 1 or the iPad 2. Anything else you there is too expensive/too buggy/lacking support/etc. As someone who owns a desktop but no laptop, the iPad 2 is just perfect. A laptop would often be redundant, though it would be handy for working outside of the home.  With the iPad, I will use it all the time both in the home and elsewhere.I will try to add some comments that haven't been covered:* I find that 16gb is fine, though this may change if app sizes get much larger. I don't intend to store my music or a bunch of videos on this. Videos can be streamed, or added as-needed, and I rely on DropBox to store files - it lets me view and edit files between my desktop and my iPad.* Part of the reason the iPad is perfect for travel is that you can use it in any position, unlike a laptop, where you have to find a seat.* It won't ever got hot or overheat. Personally, I've had a couple laptops expire on me due to overheating. You always have to keep them on a firm surface so you don't block the vents. The iPad doesn't have these problems (I think that the Macbook Airs similarly will never overheat). You no longer have to grab a tray or giant book to set your laptop on when using it in bed.* Terrific value. All hype aside, the design, durability and capability of an iPad 2 is such that I would expect to pay much more. You can find a cheap laptop for the same price, and it will be capable of much more. However, the iPad will accomplish 95% of what you want to do on a computer, and will open doors (via apps) to new and totally unexpected experiences.* Browsing the web is better on the iPad. At least, it often is. It's certainly better to take your iPad on the couch than to hunch over a laptop on the coffee table. Though the screen is small compared to a desktop screen, it's equivalent to working on a bigger screen because of how close you will be. Scrolling and navigating a webpage with your hand is a qualitatively better experience than using the tools we've become accustomed to (mouse, trackball or trackpad). I guess that's why sci-fi movies always depict computers with touch interfaces in the future. Moving the page around and adjusting the size of everything by hand never gets old.* Just like with my iPhone 4, I rarely sync my iPad 2. I'm not a huge fan of iTunes. I can sync occasionally to back-up my apps. I don't use iTunes to manage files (again, I rely on Dropbox). Dropbox and Evernote are must-have apps on all my computers and portable devices.* Safari can use some work. I prefer the tabbed browsing, not having to switch windows. There are some alternative browsers (I bought 360 Browser, which is good), but Apple won't let me select those as my default browser. I don't use Safari on my desktop, but even if I wanted to sync my passwords and history, I don't think it'll let me (it will sync bookmarks through iTunes though). I really wish Apple would loosen up so that Firefox or Chrome would be available, and that one of those could be my default.* As cool as the smart cover is, I spent my money on a wireless keyboard instead. I really don't think the smart cover is going to make a difference as long as I take other measures to protect my screen. I may skip the HDMI adapter as well - it would be fun, but there is never a time that I will need to project my iPad on my HDTV.In summary, if you think you'd like it, you'll probably love it. If you are just kinda curious but content with your current set-up, you can save yourself the money. For the same price, you can get an adequate laptop running Windows 7. I think this is a great alternative though.", "Date": "March 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "honeymoon is over", "Author": "bkluvr", "ReviewID": "R35YBRP4F9OZZ8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "i bought this from apple because amazon didn't have it yet.  I am middle- aged, love my nano, a kindle devotee from the first days, don't have a smart phone, and am a pc user.  at first i was awed by the touchscreen and the resolution quality.  images are gorgeous.  but now, it is really annoying.  too often the screen doesn't respond, and then reacts when you don't even know you're touching it.  the word processing function has been limited and limiting from the start, for someone accustomed to microsoft.if you think in buying the ipad you are getting a  compact, fast, light computer, you are not.  it IS fast.  a computer it is not.  no flash player is definitely a hinderance.  what it is great for is apps, games, (although the screen has been frustrating there too), watching movies and tv shows,  some browsing on the internet, and as a portable photo album, because images are truly fantastic on the ipad.  i find the screen very fatiguing on my eyes, and have the brightness level down almost as far as it can go.  i would never dream of reading a book on it.  kindle has nothing to worry about, as far as the ipad as a reading device.  the fact i can't see the ipad  screen outside, even in the shade, is also unfortunate, but i get it, that's a backlit screen.i am submitting this review not to bash apple, but to clarify a bit to people not familiar with macs and/or touchscreens what this device is about.  would i buy this device again? not unless it sold for maybe $300.  it is more a toy than a tool.", "Date": "August 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "ANYONE OF ANY AGE CAN USE IT.", "Author": "carol irvin \"carol irvin\"", "ReviewID": "RFX4JZ7CUL8NY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The biggest change in our lives so far with the arrival of our iPad 2 is now that we have three of them, no one is without an ipad 24/7.  You wouldn't think this would be a big deal but it is.  It has eliminated all discord here plus the place is quiet as a tomb most of the time as each person is curled up with his own ipad. We are a husband and wife in our 60s plus my husband's mother who is 100 years old. She is curled up with the iPad almost all day long as her ability to do anything active has all but vanished. She goes easily  from reading a Danielle Steele ebook to watching a Prince William and Kate lifetime movie.The above is both versions of the iPad's biggest virtue: ANYONE OF ANY AGE CAN USE IT.  Both my husband and I are techie types so we are quite expert on computers.  Friends in our age range usually are not.  My advice to every one of them is \"buy an ipad.\"  It puts those with low tech abilities on an even playing field because they do everything with their fingers and visually.  It is the supreme compliment to say about either iPad, \"any idiot can use it.\"Right now you can't buy an iPad 1.  We were going to buy a third one of those on sale but they sold out so fast that we had to get the iPad 2 as our third one.  My husband is the one who appreciates subtle refinements in electronics.  He has been in seventh heaven since it arrived.  Truthfully, my mother in law and I, as long as we can get on it and read our books, watch our movies, assemble recipes in our app cookbook, and so forth and so on, are happy as can be and both iPad versions do that extremely well.  My husband is the one who waxes rhapsodically over lighter weight, better LED screen, improved battery life, and so forth.  Like most reviewers of iPad 2 he concludes that it is a beautiful evolution but not a revolution from the first iPad.For those of you with extended families elsewhere, there are other new features which could be huge features for you.  The ability now to visit with family members by video with your ipad 2 are completely built in.  It has two way cameras. I would like to talk our other family members in California into getting one for the benefit of my mother-in-law, who could have excellent \"visits\" by iPad with all of them.Also if you want to stream what is on your ipad directly to your HDTV and projectors, that too is now built in. We don't have such a tv because we like watching directly on the iPad itself with earphones.There is also the ability to not only take your own videos but to edit them online. Plus the ability to locate your ipad if it is lost and to wipe its contents remotely.These above new features are opening up a lot of possibilities for educators as well.  Apple maintains an entire subsection on its website to helping educators use the new features to iPad 2 to best advantage.  Essentially, it wants to enable them to use the iPad 2 to put its content onto a screen immediately in front of their students with the teacher controlling the whole thing with his or her fingers.  Go over to Apple to check this all out as it is incredible.I absolutely love the camera on the iPad 2.  There was no camera on the iPad 1.  Much as I have always loved my iPhone's camera, and much as I complained about who would want to use a camera the size of the iPad 2, I admit I underestimated it.  It is just a fabulous camera and with just pointing and shooting you take pictures that look as if a professional had taken them.I also researched this cover that apple was pushing real hard.  It looks great but i discovered the users were not happy with it.  Turns out they have to clean their screens every time they use it because it leaves three big marks on the glass every time.  They also said it was unstable as a stand and one guy smashed his ipad on the floor as a result, shattering it.  Apple is not very good at these accessory devices.  So we ordered the zoogue ipad 2 case and are very happy with it. We have zoogues on our other two ipads as well and are totally happy with them.

Lleras", "ReviewID": "R3SEXRV40Z31JD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The iPad is an invaluable travel companion if you are a frequent travelet.Why do I preffer black vs white? If what you mostly do is watch videos on your iPad you want it with the black bezel because the video will blend with the black bezel and look larger than with the white it becomes kind of a distraction, this is the reason why most TV's in the market have a dark or a black bezel.Portability of this thing is amazing, Its light and its easy to lug around when you are traveling. Also the battery life is exceptional, I'm bad at keeping my devices charged up and I have done a couple of 8 hour trips and my ipad was stil kicking when I landed and a few days after, Im truely surprized.For those of you debating between the 3GAT&T;, 3GVerison or the Wifi version, it depends on where you go to. I had the original 32 wifi only and I was very happy with it I noticed I got Wi-Fi access at a lot of places and I could also use the wifi hot spot on my phone to connect however, in recent travels I have been sent to middle of nowhere america where AT&T; has no 3G coverage and hotels have no wifi (yes they are out there, hotels that still have no wifi) after I returned from my last trip to said location I decided I should get the Verizon iPad simply from the coverage perspective and since the 3G service is not on contract and the Verizon plans have more options I decided that was my choice. Now is this the best option for everyone, no! I think the 3G is just for a small amount of users the vast majority should be fine with a 16GB or a 32GB, if you know your way around the app market place and apps like Air Video Server and tools like DVD Fab and TVersity you dont need that much storage space on your iPad you can simply stream everything. Besides, I have a 32GB and I have 57 videos loaded in that 32GB iPad which if I watch 10-12 on a trip it is an overstatement, I'll watch a few on the plane but the rest, Im streaming from my Media Center at home or from NetFlix. When talking to people in line I was shocked at the number of people looking for the Verizon version when they do not travel, people if you are home most of the time just use your wifi, its cheaper and its faster! Another thing to note is that if you are an international traveller and want 3G the Verizon iPad is NOT Global wireless (so no 3G anywhere outside of the US) however wifi will work just fine.You will see people complain about resolution and such and honestly, I think the resolution is perfect, the iPad is not meant to replace your laptop or your desktop or your TV, if it was why they would have bothered with airplay? If you are expecting to dump your laptop because you got an iPad think again, if you just use your laptop for browsing pages and playing games then you might get away with it however if you expect to do Office on these, think again, until MS gets their act together and decides that IOS is another venue of revenue for them I will still need to carry my laptop around to do word/excel/ppt files. Lack of flash support has not bothered me, yes I wish I could see some pages however, Im not in to the too flashy stuff (no pun intended) I rather get the straight text and keep going my only gripe would be that when Im conected via WiFi I would like to get full pages and not the mobile version however that is not an iPad problem it is a server problem.Overall my score goes as followsComfort and portability A+Battery Life A+App Diversity and usability A+Interface A+Expandibility C (I dont need a USB port or anything like that however it is annoying that if I ever needed and expansion either I have to pay for an adapter or its not available)TV Out Support B+ (simply judging that for HDMI you have to buy the dongle)Cammera Quality C (who needs a cammera in their iPad anyways? Face time sure, rear facing meh)Other thoughts:Get a screen protector, I tried the Invisible Shield for my Gen 1 and hated it, the material removes the slickness of the screen and makes it harder to interact. I like the Splash screen protector, it is like its not there and it does make cleaning a bit easier.Get a case this thing is beautiful but if you would like to maintain its resale value get a case that cover both front or back or separate covers, I think the Vapor case hack is pretty interesting.Investigate tools like DVD Fab Video Converter (excellent for making iPad versions of your DVD's and BD's and it does take care of EVERYTHING for you from conversion to the right format to importing to iTunes) TVersity and Air Video for content streaming.Be realistic on your expectations, I know Apple calls their products magic and their user interface and experience is fenomenal however there are limitations as to what these things can do so try to make an informed purchase that you are happy with instead of rushing and then having something that doesnt meet your expectations.

So, here is the \"Dummies Guide to the iPad\" to help you make that decision.\"I promise to keep the jargon down to a bare minimum\" :To begin with the iPad must be paired to an existing Laptop or Desktop PC. These can be normal Microsoft Windows or Mac PC's. Once paired you can use the iPad by itself. It only has to be paired once. Although, there is a rumour that the next generation will work straight out of the box.You will be able to:-Touch and pinch the screen to type words and move things around-Send and Receive Emails-Browse the Internet including Online Banking, Internet Shopping and more...-Listen to Music, including the Radio when there is a Wireless (Wi-Fi) connection-Watch Videos and Movies-Write and Print Letters (see the section on 'Printing' further down)-Download and Play Games-Become a Smarter Person (more on this later)-Display Pictures - it is an electronic Picture Frame too!-Take Pictures and Movies, if it has the onboard camera (iPad2 and newer)-Have a chat with the relatives abroad using Video Conferencing technology-Download THOUSANDS of books into a snazzy Book Reader that you can actually turn pages on the screen with-There are loads more - I'll leave them as a surprise if you decide to buy one :)You will NOT be able to:-Watch a special type of animation or movie using a technology known as 'Flash' - don't worry about this though, you'll hear lots of people complaining about it. It really is no big deal and you'll learn to live without it. Over time, many of the popular web sites will move away from using Flash and use a newer technology that DOES work on iPads.-Insert a CD (there is no slot and you don't actually need one)-In fact, there is not much else you can't do with an iPad :THE WIZARDSNo, not the ones' from Oz! Wizards are helpful programs that magically pop up and automatically configure things like the Internet and Email connections for you. The iPad has more Wizards than you can wave a wand at! When you first switch it on and whenever you need to set something up it will automatically present you with a Wizard. Therefore setting things up is as easy as 1-2-3.The iPad is also an iPod!! - Loading music is done in one of two ways.1 - install the free version of iTunes onto your normal PC and follow the Wizards instructions to download your music from the 'iTunes Store' or transfer your music from your favourite CD collection. Then, connect the iPad to your computer using the supplied cable and it will automatically 'Synchronise' your music to the iPad. Yup, you guessed it - using yet another Wizard!2 - iTunes is a built in application (or App) on the iPad itself. Tap this App to search for and download your music directly to the iPad. You could even download a movie or your favourite episode of 24 too!Once the music is on there just tap the iPod App to listen to it. Easy-Peasy!APPSThe iPad extensively uses Apps. Apps are downloaded, using Wi-Fi. This is why you don't need a CD drive. These are the icons that are displayed on the screen.Apps are downloaded from the Internet using yet another App called: \"The App Store\". Tap this icon to search for or see a list of the most popular Apps available, some are paid for and some are free! Tap the 'Install' button next to the one you'd like, follow the Wizards instructions and the App will automatically download and appear as a new icon on the screen.LOADING PICTURESThese can be loaded onto the iPad using iTunes, Email or the 'Camera Connection Kit' - this is a separate adaptor ($30) that plugs into the bottom of the iPad. Just insert the memory card from your camera into the adaptor and it will automatically load the pictures into the built in Photo App.THE PICTURE FRAMEWhen the iPad is locked (by pressing the button on the top-right side) and then back on again, you'll see a little icon in the lower right side corner of the display. Tap this and the Photo App will automatically display your pictures in full screen mode, converting the iPad into a digital Photo frame! It is a great feature. This means that you can leave the ipad on the shelf, literally as part of your rooms decor! You may want to purchase a 'Dock ($30)' to have the iPad tilted and supported at just the right angle.Tip: if you need a reason to justify buying an iPad to your wife - use the Picture Frame one!!PRINTINGPrinting is done wirelessly, however you MUST use one of the wireless printers detailed on the apple.com website. Typically, it will not print to anything other than one of those printers. There is one caveat to this statement, it is possible to print to any wireless printer if you pay for and download a third party App that is available via the App Store - use the search keywords 'wireless printing' to find it.It is also possible to email whatever you'd like to print and pick it up on your normal PC for printing.Finally, I mentioned that you could become a Smarter Person by using an iPad - in fact this is not a joke. There are thousands of educational Apps including ones' for learning Astronomy through to learning how to read and play music and even Apps that will help you learn a new language. The possibilities are literally right at your finger tips!!If you're unsure of which size to buy just buy the largest one you can afford. I have a 32GB version and have only used half of its capacity even with some very large Apps installed.The iPad is many things to many people and the information above is just scratching the surface.\"I hope this review helps you make the right decision and I also hope that I did not use too much confusing jargon.\"Good luck!*** update 12th October 2011 ***Apple have released their new Operating System (iOS 5)Amongst many new and enhanced features there is now the ability to synchronise data across multiple Devices. They call it 'iCloud' - think of iCloud as 'Virtual Filing Cabinet' to store your Documents, Diary and a record of your downloaded media from iTunes. Always accessible as long as there is an internet connection.iCloud also allows the iPad to be used without having to 'Pair' it with a computer.

Since Verizon chose to go it alone with CDMA, and the regulators let them do that, you are stuck  in their little prison if you want to switch carriers....So I was told by Apple that the data service would be easily turned on and off like a faucet, and that I would only have to pay for the months for which service was enabled.  Great!  I buy it in December, immediately use it \"off-campus\" in Albany on Christmas vacation (no internet at my Dad's if you can believe it...)Sometime during Dec/Jan, I call AT&T; to get them to help me figure out why I can not get in to the Settings->Cellular Data->My Account feature.  First call was probably 15-20 minutes long, and the AT&T; representative is clueless.  It was like I was asking for help with my Acme Moon Lander.  I suspect it would have been news to the rep that AT&T; actually has millions of iPad customers who pay them monthly.  In fact enough customers that AT&T; should be able to escalate to iPad expert reps.Call two: Again 15-20 minutes, this time the rep is much more adamant that this must be an apple screen (though he could not explain why the AT&T; death-star logo was on the screen I was having trouble with.)Just to play along, I call Apple, and waste some of their money and more of my time.  They quickly confirm this is not their problem.I finally figure out although it would be a nice-to-have to check my account out this way, I can go to their web site, and log in.  It takes me a surprisingly long time (about 20 minutes) to figure out how to \"suspend\" my service.  By this time, I've waited much too long, and I'm going to have to pay them for January, even though I had not used it then.OK, I pay my bills, and now I get a new bill for Mar 25 thru Apr 25.  Whot?  My service is suspended, why are they still billing me?Now the reason for the dud star: I call AT&T;, and get Rep one.  They are very nice, and explain that even though I have suspended my service, I still have to pay.  What I really wanted to do is cancel my service.  Huh?  This is not sounding too much like a faucet anymore.  She suggests that what I REALLY want is what she calls \"Session based\" service.  She can not do that for me, but she will connect me with someone who will.I get put on hold where a recording LOUDLY tries to sell me a new Samsung tablet, repeatedly tells me I can  \"Re-think the Possible\" with AT&T.;  Let me tell you, I've starting to rethink how badly customer service can possibly be at this time.  ....Oh yeah, and there is something in there about not wasting my time too.Rep number two:  I recount my tale of woe,  but she will not have any of it.  First of all, I better get it straight: she does not know where this \"Session based\" phrase I'm throwing around came from, but I better get it straight.  Its called pre-paid, and we will hence-forth ONLY call it pre-paid, so we both know what we are talking about.  OK lady, you're the boss, Pre-paid.  How do I switch my account to Pre-paid, and how do I get this bill cancelled?  Well it turns out they can not just flip a software switch on their end.  The type of service (let's just call it a billing plan) is determined by my SIM card.  You've got that right: even though it is just a stupid serial number in a database, I've got to haul myself down to an Apple or AT&T; store to get a new SIM card, so that they can bill me differently.Apparently WAY back when, when I first signed up with AT&T; (which I think I did on the phone because the web site was too confusing), THAT is when I went off the rails.  That is why my Settings->Cellular Data->My Account feature gives me a weird error which three different AT&T; reps have not been able to help me with.  This woman was annoyed with me, and clearly thought it was all my fault for getting myself in to this predicament.  ....But she could not give me help with my bill.  Onward:More annoying \"commercials\":  you know if this Rep loudly read the scripts from these commercials while we waited for the next rep, it would be considered really rude, and nobody would put up with it.  Give me the elevator music please.  I am not calling AT$T because I've got money burning holes in all of my pockets to buy another tablet, I am calling because they are not billing me the way I was promised.Rep number three: I again recount my tale of woe (more quickly this time, so I don't p*ss him off).  Since I'm now in to minute 30 of this call, and that last rep was really testy with me, I'm now asking them to forgive three months for service not consumed.Guess what?  I tell this guy I apparently should have signed myself up for Pre-paid service way back when, and that is why I am here now, and he says: \"Oh you mean Session-based service?\", and proceeds to use the \"Session-based\" term that Rep #2 reprimanded me about for the rest of the conversation.So AT&T;: you are just awful.  When I communicate with you, you use the term \"Phone Number\" when it is not a phone. And I can not make phone calls (or text as far as I know)  You allow me to suspend my service, but you still charge me the same money, whats that all about?  Your own people disagree on what terms should be used for the billing plans.  And we are not talking innocuous terms like \"pop\" vs. \"Soda\", because this is how I got in to this mess.  I signed up for the wrong service, and I suspect it is because your poor discipline with terminology.  And that original error message, why give me a mis-leading error, just put up a screen which say \"You have got a XXX plan, and this info is not available under that plan\".  Cancel/Suspend, Pre-Paid/Session-based. Phone Number/device number.  \"Invalid account\"/Wrong plan type.  Pathetic. And I mean pathetic, not ludicrous, or shameful, or awful.  Pathetic.", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "WISH I BOUGHT A TABLET EARLIER.", "Author": "Harkanwar Anand", "ReviewID": "R3D8AOAY06VVE5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I thought about getting a tablet a hundred and seventy  eight times before finally buying one. I have a couple of laptops and a mac desktop so I wondered if I really need one. I know it isn't that expensive to own but then I also had 2 iPod Touches. So basically I was going to get the iPad 1 first but then they came out with the iPad 2, I waited several months and then like any man who hates indecision I decided to get a tablet. The choice was simple. I was used to the iPod Touch (4th generation) and thought this would possibly be similar. I was worried it would sit in one corner of my house. To clarify I never needed an iPad, what I did like however the most was the speaker on it. You see, i'm big on music and wanted something that can behave like a traveling jukebox. Besides watching a film when I'm on an airplane  won't be a bad idea either. I was sincerely considering getting the Samsung Galaxy 10.1 but then I knew this thing has been the best selling product of all time so I decided to get it anyway. I've had it for a little over a month now and in the following points i shall speak of the features, some unique and share my findings with you.UNIQUE FEATURES OF THE IPAD 2 -1. At 9.7 inches of diagonal length and brightness that is nothing short of being called exquisite one would imagine this thing to have an average battery or a good battery but the battery life is extraordinary. I use my iPad for a couple of hours daily and I must say that despite music playback, wireless data transferring to the iPad from my mac iTunes library, this thing lasts me for at least 5 days. This is remarkable. I can give you the best device in the world as a manufacturer but if the battery life isn't good what good is it to keep charging it. It does take a very long time to charge mind you which tells you that it's gonna last you a while. For some bizarre reason I like to charge this with my Mac. Charging using the wall outlet is slowly getting primitive.2. The speaker is amazing, it's loud and clear but you have to know where the speakers are placed and it's very important or else it will hamper your experience. Sometimes you have to hold it in your hands to make sure the sound output is ideal. Does it work well placing it on  a flat surface glass or  wood? Yes. What do I use the speaker for? iPod. At 16GB this is just about enough for me to carry a contemporary selection of music  and films with me. Does it sound good while browsing internet pages? Yes. Youtube is exhilarating to say the least. Also only selected Facebook videos will work because many are not available on mobile devices so if something doesn't run on your iPhone or android phone, it may not run on the iPad. Fair trade.3. There are two cameras, both are sub par for 2011 but if you're sitting in a dimly lit room and have washed your face, it may just somehow take a nice photo of you but I seldom take pictures from it. I like to record 30 second to 1 minute videos and email it directly to people. I always keep it connected with my wifi. This is really convenient and is a NEW WAY for me to keep in touch. I never did this with my mac or my iPhone. Also please note an interesting thing here, if your video is too long, your iPad tells you that you cannot send it owing to the large size. I have not gotten into the whole editing video and cutting it thing so what I then resort to is UPLOADING  IT DIRECTLY ON YOUTUBE. Great feature though quality is to be compromised slightly.4. The iPad 2 weighs less than the iPad 1 by a significant amount. This shall be reason enough for people to upgrade or maybe you guys can wait for the iPad 3 to come out in April next year (random estimate)5. While typing on the iPad is a breeze for \"novices\" and \"intermediates\" it is not ideal for a super fast expert typer. Having said that I don't use it much for typing. I am much faster on my phone than I am on the iPad. I have noticed i am able to type best when I am not holding the tablet in my hands and it is resting on a surface. Now I have installed a invisible shield for it because it liked to keep a daily account of fingerprints. Did I find an ideal one? No. I also use an invisible PLASTIGLASS thing for the back which I found on Amazon and found super amazing. The back is so smooth even with this accessory. I find the leather cases a little too pricey and there are several available but I find them kind of obstructing to the design of this iPad and a little cheap so I don't use.6. Great company on an airplane - While I am always fidgeting with this device when it's playing something, the device makes for great company on an airplane provided you have an \"mp4\" type file to play back on it. You can easily install it using iTunes. But if you have  an avi file or a divx file I don't know how to play them or transfer them. The iPad doesn't work as a USB STORAGE device so it won't show up on your finder (or my computer) when connected. There is no way for a user to save files by dragging and dropping. WHILE MANY ARGUE over the relevance of such storage, I believe the absence of it helps in keeping things organized and we all could do with a little less clutter. iTunes works beautifully for transferring stuff. I have noticed on all apple platforms (iPhone, iPod, iPad) that uploading a picture to Facebook involves more steps than on Android. Infact in certain cases Apple makes you buy an application to upload files to Facebook for the iPad. I find this cheek quite amusing but I take it with a pinch of humor. While playing back video you can tilt the device in any which way you want and the screen tilts that way. The video output is superior and the tilt  helps so it makes sure your fingers don't keep smacking into the headset jack when headphones are attached.7. Browsing - Yahoo looks utterly brilliant on the iPad. I love to go  once a day and simply look at their news features. Most search engines have specific websites for the tablets to access em and it looks super. My friend has a Xoom and he loves his tablet and is always talking about it but I see a sincere longing in him for an Apple iPad. The interface is unmatchable whether you are browsing, playing back a video or a song, the iPad wins. I do not use this as a task keeper so I don't bother with office utilities and all. Neither do I edit videos on the iPad but I believe there are inexpensive  solutions available. I read about them all the time on Macworld. Browsing on the internet, watching youtube videos, being on Facebook - it all seems flawless on the iPad. Much better than using a computer or an iPod or a phone. This is where the iPad truly shines. The font and the brightness I repeat is flawless and magical - nothing like i have seen in a dozen years of computers.8. TRANSFER - With the new ios 5.00  and iCloud I can actually send music, video, pictures to the iPad or play them back on my mac without connecting. Another big significant improvement. Now if only I could charge it wirelessly :)9. Are you thinking about getting the 32gb version? Don't. The 16gb is just fine  - for applications you won't need more. Multi-tasking is very easy and truly mastered on the iPad as opposed to the relevance on an iPod or iPhone courtesy of the big screen. Yes there is no flash support so I can't watch imdb trailers directly on the iPad. I have found applications which allow me to download music directly for free on the iPad - I am sure you will too. Netflix works flawlessly on this. I have put 740 songs on it and three films and have 35 applications installed but I still have 3GB remaining. After watching this film once I delete it to keep it free for another. This way you won't need a bigger iPad but if you do the difference is just $100 + Tax. I have also found that there exist many solutions for iPad users to wirelessly connect the iPad with a wireless storage hard drive. The expansion options are super. So take a look into that but I strongly advise getting just the basic  16gb version. I have a 64 gb iPhone and 64gb iPod so maybe I am so adamant on the uselessness of a higher storage iPad too.10. Miscallenous - It works with bluetooth, the iPad is light, unique for browsing, unique for youtube, ultra fast, multitasking is beautiful, you can play music or pandora while browsing, you can also switch the screen off and it will continue singing to you for several hours, the battery life does justice to it's perfections, the cameras are ok, i never Skype using it or i don't use FaceTime cause I don't know many people who do that. I like to carry it in my 13inch laptop case logic bag when I have to. I haven't dropped much water on it because i like it too much to be clumsy  with it. No headphones or instruction manual is  shipped. It took me roughly 30 minutes to set it up by connecting  with my mac.  It comes with a decent amount of charge so you can go 4 hours of playing around with it right out the box.I want you to look at all the above mentioned points and ask yourself if this is a notebook replacement? Obviously not. Because it has no physical keyboard, hdmi out, usb slot but if you are a casual browser, you can invest in this first and use it within the first 30 days to make your mind up. Apple is good that way. Overall - this is by far the best device i have ever used. It beats my iPod, iPhone, android phone, old blackberry, my mac desktop (close  2nd) , my ASUS laptop, my tv, my xbox, my blu ray player, my cameras and even my iron. Good luck.

We have one white 64GB WiFi/AT&T; 3G and one black 16GB WiFi.My family all pooled together to buy my son his iPad 2 (after they saw how he was responding to my 3G version).  Unlike many children with autism, my son has never been very computer or technologically inclined.  His interests have always been with physical and tangible objects and interests (not a bad thing, at all)... but we strongly suspected that the iPad touchscreen would change all of that.There are some remarkable apps for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) - some of which (fortunately) we don't need to use, since my son is very verbal.  That having been said - I have watched how the iPad is completely transforming the lives of his peers who are not very verbal.  Since this isn't a review of the apps, I won't write a whole book about the great apps - except to highlight three that perform really well on the iPad for my son:  1) the \"First Then\" schedule - you can use stock photos, photos you take, or grab them from Google images; 2) Stories2Learn where you can make your own social stories using photos you take; and \"Look in My Eyes\" a game that makes your child look squarely into the eyes of images of children (there is a secret number displayed) that needs to be entered on a next page to get \"prizes\".Okay - so now a review of the iPad itself...For the 64GB wifi/3G model - I swore I would only use it for my son and myself... that I wouldn't get sucked into using it for work (since I am the one who paid for it... right?).  Okay, well that plan lasted all of 3 minutes.  I have all of the attachments now: the VGA connector (used it yesterday to put maps up on the wall during a meeting using our projector); the HDMI connector (which is genius - since it has a 2nd port to provide power using your own AC adapter - and I use this at home and at work to plug into the TVs/LCD displays); the USB and SD Card reader (which imports my photos from my Nikon DSLRs); and my sister bought me the bluetooth keyboard (which I thought would be superfluous - but since I AM actually using this for work ALL OF THE TIME - it comes in very handy).  All of the Apple attachments work great.  Yesterday, I received a cheap non-Apple 2100 mAmp car charger from Amazon - and it works GREAT.  Charges, and I'm not afraid of my iPad battery frying!So, let me get to the two negatives - since that's why YOU are reading this review - right?  You want to figure out what is wrong with this thing... if anything.  The honest truth is that the cameras STINK!!!  Totally, and completely.  So, why give it a 5 star review, right?  The cameras WORK for the purpose that I wanted:  to use facetime to call my sister who lives overseas... and for that - it works passibly well.  Not in low light.  NEVER in low light.  So... I adjust.  Don't call Asia with the lights off!  Problem solved, solution found!  Trying to take photos with the front or back camera - also not great.  REALLY HORRIBLE in the low light conditions I just mentioned.  YET - when you take photos outside in the sunshine - they are actually quite decent.  I'm a photo snob, though - so nothing that didn't come from one of the Nikon DSLRs is suspect to me... DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU ARE HOPING THIS WILL REPLACE YOUR COMPACT DIGITAL CAMERA.  My Blackberry phone camera is a million times better - and I still think that THAT stinks.While I'm on the subject - let's talk about Facetime.  Apple - it's a great product.  I really love it.  HATE that I can't use it on my iMac at home unless I upgrade to Snow Leopard - which I have no intention of doing.  Glad my son now has his own iPad 2 so that I can call him when I'm at work or on the road... So others who are reading this understand - the Facetime App is a billion times better than the Skype app.  Apple made Facetime to work on their computers.  Period.  As such, it takes those not-so-great cameras I just mentioned, and maximizes their abilities and functionality.  If you can call someone Mac to Mac - use Facetime.What else don't I like:  the cost of all of those add ons I mentioned.  Seriously!?!?  My choice to buy them.  I will stop my rant.What I HATE:  the smartcover.  It's horrible.  Don't waste your money on the smart cover!  It's not smart.  I bought the orange - and it's already dirty in the ridges (remember I take this everywhere, and to work... and I work as a project engineering overseeing large dirty and messy job sites) - but the orange was already a sick creamsicle color, but it is just lame.  It doesn't always \"snap\" to the edge with the precision shown in the video commercial.  Just buy something else.  Or save your money.  I am waiting for the Otterbox Defender to come out - since I now realize how much I will travel with this.Everything else - I love.  The list is long, and I won't bore you.  As a child, I dreamed of such a device... and it meets almost all of my desires and wishes for a non-human user interface.  The AT&T; 3G is good enough, don't know if Verizon would have been better... I will always question my decision.  I can watch Netflix - but it doesn't hold coverage on my trainride... but then again, my cell phone from Verizon doesn't either.  There are lots of \"dead zones\" on my train ride to work.  When I'm stationary - in the woods, at a restaurant, in a store - the AT&T; signal is typically strong enough to handle the most demanding streaming.Visually, this object is a stunner.  Physically, this object is a winner:  it feels great in your hands, is responsive to the touch, and it makes everyone want one...I recommend that anyone who has time on their hands buy one.  If you don't have time on your hands, don't buy one, since you will never sleep..... that is my woe...", "Date": "April 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "A Step Closer", "Author": "Craig Whisenhunt", "ReviewID": "R36OU1VJHER2BP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For anyone out there who is considering whether or not to make the leap and purchase the iPad 2, this review is for you.  If you're still debating between the iPad 1 and the iPad 2 check out my review of the first generation iPad right here on Amazon to see a discussion of its strengths and weaknesses with a number of people commenting (both positively and negatively) over the past 11 months.Let me begin by saying this upfront, I don't work for Apple, I don't own Apple Stock, and whether you buy an iPad, Xoom, a laptop or a pad of paper and pencil I don't get anything for writing this.  I'm not an Apple \"fanboy\" although I can give credit where credit is due and lately Apple has deserved a lot of credit for some of their products.Physical CharacteristicsThe iPad 2 is absurdly thin.  More importantly than it's thinness is its tapered edge which feels more natural in  your hand.  One of the biggest complaints about the original iPad was it really wasn't tremendously comfortable to hold for long periods at a time.  For a tablet device designed to be held, that's a pretty big deal.  Apple really has done an amazing job of cramming everything into an even smaller space than before and the difference is really noticeable when you're holding the device.  In addition to the tapered edge, Apple managed to reduce the overall weight of the iPad 2.  That might not seem like a huge deal to most, especially when you consider the weight difference isn't tremendous when you're already under 2 pounds, but I spend a good part of my day holding the iPad in my hands and the weight difference is surprising by the end of the day.  The first generation isn't heavy by any means, but the iPad 2 outshines it.New and \"Improved\"Apple doubled the RAM in the iPad 2 from 256MB to 512MB.  What does that mean?  For most casual users, probably not a whole lot.  There is a performance bump that everyone will see the effects of in things like loading times for webpages that are open in the background, but 256MB was sufficient for most daily use and games.  If you're planning to use your device for some of the more graphically intense games the iPad 2 does offer a better method of graphics processing that'll help deliver faster images with fewer jerky movements.  If you're just playing Angry birds and reading e-mail you're not going to know the difference.The screen is the same for all real purposes.  It is technically a \"new\" part in that it isn't identical to the old, it's a bit thinner and more efficient, but it's the same resolution.  The Glass is thinner though, and this amounts to a fair bit of the weight loss from one generation to the next.  In playing with the device it seems surprising but despite feeling lighter it actually feels more sturdy in your hands.  I still wouldn't suggest dropping it, but if it were to fall the iPad 2 certainly feels like it might stand a better chance to survive.  Try not to drop it though.The addition of 2 cameras was expected.  Some were a bit surprised to see the first generation released without the cameras.  Whether it was for a price point consideration, or a means to get people to upgrade, Apple held off until iPad 2.  The cameras do a reasonable job, but they're not going to replace a dedicated digital camera, or really even the camera on your phone for most still images.  The cameras do a substantially better job with video, and FaceTime is probably one of the best reasons to get the iPad 2 over the original iPad.  For those who might not be familiar, FaceTime is Apple's face to face conferencing system, kind of like Skype, or if you'd rather, kind of like the Jetson's TV/Phone.  With the push of a button you can be having a face to face chat with a loved one just about anywhere in the world (provided they're on a wireless network at the time).  FaceTime doesn't work over 3G natively (it can be used over a wifi connection created by a 3G device however) so you're not going to be able to use it in your car anytime soon.  This is probably a good thing though.  It is incredibly easy to use and if you know other people with an iPad 2, iPhone 4, or Mac it's a lot of fun.Smart Covers aren't really \"smart\" but they're really very useful.  Not only do they provide a stylistic enhancement of the device, but they serve a practical and functional purpose of doubling as a screen protector and stand in 2 configurations.  You can find them in a variety of colors and from third market suppliers, and it's a safe bet that more will be out soon to capitalize on the magnetic sensors in the iPad 2.  It's unfortunate that this same feature can't somehow be retrofitted to the iPad 1, I wouldn't have thought a case would be a compelling reason to consider a product over it's competitor, but these covers are really so useful it's hard to understand why they've not been there since the beginning.Multitasking SupportOne of the biggest knocks against the iPad when first released was the lack of native multi-tasking support.  Jailbreakers added the feature quickly and Apple soon realized it would be a requirement for any future device's success and released an OS update that included the feature.  The iPad 2 capitalizes on that progress and takes it a step further with the increased RAM enabling more open applications to be suspended at once, and the time to open or close an application has improved as well.  That said, even the first generation managed to open and close apps faster than most people would be used to on their computers, so while this is an improvement it's more akin to showing off.AppsOne thing that Apple has clearly the advantage in for the moment is app availability.  The App store has close to 70,000 iPad specific Apps, all of which will work on the iPad 2.  The new cameras will undoubtedly see this list expand rapidly, as will the inclusion of a gyroscope for gaming and motion based uses.  There are also a substantial number of professional applications ranging from document creation to photo editing and vector drawing.  Chances are if you can dream it, there's an App for that (and if not you might want to get started on one to fill in the gap).  The Android market is making a strong showing, and ultimately it'll likely be a strong competitor, for now it still has a ways to go, but any potential buyer should consider the strength of the application market before buying a tablet.Pros:Weight.  Seriously.  The minimal weight of this thing is by far the most impressive feature about it in my opinion.  It seems to defy physics and logic that so much could be in such a small space working that hard for that long.Battery Life.  From full to dead my iPad 2 went just over 11 hours with the movie Robin Hood showing twice during that time, the screen at half brightness, wifi turned on, an Angry Birds marathon and a good portion of a book in ibook.  That's better than a work day and that's constantly on.Books.  This is definitely a Pro, but reading itself could go either way.  The great benefit to the iPad is having access to Google Books, ibook, Nook, and Kindle.  This allows for some comparison shopping and price competition (although for the most part they're all usually about the same).  Reading in the evenings in bed is great as the back light means you don't have to worry about keeping others awake, but the glass screen causes some glare trouble when trying to read outside or near a sunny window.  If you're an avid outdoor reader the Kindle might still be your best bet.Cons:Still no dedicated USB support.  While there is a camera add-on that allows for certain USB devices to be used there is no option for mass storage.  Some of the Android Tablets allow for this and if you find yourself wanting to use your tablet as a standalone storage device this might be something to consider.  The device can read from certain flash drives though, but is largely limited to photo and video files.  Jailbreaks offer solutions to this, but those come with their own issues as well.Still no dedicated SD card slot.  This is troublesome on two fronts.  First, if you want to import pictures from your camera you have to have an adapter which is just one more thing to carry around.  Second, the lack of expansion means you're limited to what you purchase in terms of storage.  I purchased a 32GB iPad last time and never filled it up completely, so for me capacity wasn't an issue.  If you want to be able to have your entire movie collection with you though... you may want to consider whether the iPad 2 can meet your space requirements.HDMI output.  Really this is a Pro and a Con.  The iPad does allow for HD output over HDMI but again it requires an adapter.  All of these adapters are additional purchases for features that some tablets offer built in.  This can be a pain, but then again if you're not likely to ever use HDMI Output then you're not paying for something you won't use.No Flash Support.  This is becoming less and less of an issue as the internet and web developers are moving away from Flash for many websites, but there are a lot still out there relying on Adobe's Flash to run properly (including a lot of web based games).  Before you pick a tablet consider what kind of websites you frequent and try and determine if they are Flash driven or not.  If they are you may really want to consider something from the Android offerings as it is expected that they'll have at least some Flash support.If you're in the market for a tablet device the iPad 2 should definitely be on your short list.  If you're uncertain it is always best to go and play with these things hands on first if you can.  Best Buy is a good place for that, so are Verizon Stores since they have the Xoom and 3G iPad. Don't get pulled into the hype and mania that comes with an Apple release.  They're exciting and new, and they're impressive enough to warrant some excitement, but it will die down and there will be other products that prove a strong competitor to the iPad 2.  If you're looking for right now though, this is probably your best bet.  I gave the device 4 stars, as I did the iPad 1.  I did this in contemplation of the features offered by competitors that are absent from the iPad, most notably the requirement for adapters for USB/SD/HDMI.  While these features are there, they aren't as convenient as in other tablets.  With that in mind I firmly believe that the iPad more than makes up for this in usability, reliability, and design and in those areas far exceeds its current competitors.", "Date": "March 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "SuperPad for a preacher!", "Author": "J.

So, the verdict is in:I put it in a black leather case and deliver sermons from it every week (written on a Mac and transferred to the iPad by \"Print to PDF\" at A5 size straight to a Dropbox folder, then transferred on the iPad from Dropbox to iBooks. It takes about 20 seconds). I prefer the iPad to printed sermon notes and wedding outlines because it's more easily hand-holdable, I can use a custom color scheme at no extra charge for ink, the print can be very large, I'm not wasting a bunch of paper, it's lighter, smaller, and more portable than a large-print Bible, and when talking to people after church I've got access to my calendar and address book so I can schedule appointments, get contact information, write reminders for that week's staff meeting, etc., -- all while standing in the foyer greeting members and visitors.I've also used it for presentations by connecting it to a vga projector input at the podium and utilizing the mirrored display. You aren't limited to Keynote for that although it does work well. But I've found it just as useful with iBooks, Bible software, and even YouTube player. The portability is fantastic -- disconnect the video adapter, slap the cover closed and walk away.Daily uses: mileage and expense tracking, keeping track of contacts, calendars & notes, video record-keeping, listening to Texas Rangers baseball broadcasts, web surfing, investment management, reading papers and books, and navigation. It's my favorite device for reading and responding to most emails.It can stand in for a computer in a pinch, which it had to recently when my laptop was put out of commission for a few days by a lightning strike. Using various apps most of the data I need on a daily basis is automatically synced wirelessly between the iPad, iPhone, and MBAir, so I still had my complete calendar and all my appointments (iCal/Google combo), access to all my email (IMAP gmail), all my notes (Evernote), vital documents (Dropbox), and the ability to research and write sermons, articles, and class presentations. It's capable enough that I can get by with leaving my laptop at the office most evenings. Yea!It's far more portable than even my MacBook Air. It's small and discrete enough to take into restaurants, tuck into the console in my car, and take into hospital waiting rooms without appearing insensitive to anxious family members. Instant on and off means you can pick it up to glance at the weather radar, or check an address, or take a note as easily as picking up an iPhone, but the size makes it much faster and easier to enter and view information.

Would 16gb be enough, or should I go for 64gb (since it's not like you can add memory to it later)? Or maybe I should take the moderate middle road and get 32gb? I had definitely decided on WiFi, not because 3G doesn't appeal, but because I don't need another monthly bill. What about the Apple-refurbished iPads? Are they as good as the new? Is there any tangible difference? If these are the same questions you have, I'll try to flesh out these answers in detail -- as well as what the iPad is good for -- and what it is decidedly not good for, and what a dedicated PC-user (like myself) should expect from a first-time Apple purchase.THE SPECS:So, Question #1: White or black? I was instantly enamored by the white. It was so... different. And that is the reason to go for white. Perhaps the only one. However, the reasons not to go for white outweigh this almost immediately: Primarily, the contrast of the white does in fact make the screen appear less bright and vibrant (I noted this in the Apple store) and there are reports of light-leakage. I went for black, and have no regrets.Question #2: What size? This was probably the question I spent the most time on, and I felt as if I couldn't get a really good answer for it. Some people seemed to find 16gb to be more than enough, while others said even 64gb wasn't enough. I almost bought the 16gb, but ended up compromising and getting a 32gb refurbished from Apple for the same price as the new 16gb. And I'm really glad I did, because I've already used more than the 14.4gb -- which is the usable space available one the 16gb.The 16gb, I've discovered, would have been ideal for someone only using apps and browsing the internet. Forget using it for music or movie storage, it's just not happening. On my iPad I have about 80 apps currently, consuming 5.6gb of space. Contrast that with the 1300 songs I have on there which are taking up about 8gb of space, and you'll see what I mean about 16gb being an apps-only device. So, if you already have an iPod, say, then it might make sense to get the 16gb.The 32gb is ideal for apps and storing a moderate music library, something I never would have anticipated using the iPad for -- but it turns out, I always have my iPad in my car, and find it much more convenient overall than my CDs. I've even gotten rid of an old stereo I used to play CDs on in the house. They're just kind of obsolete once you switch to storing tunes on an i-device.The 64gb, I imagine would be perfect for storing a little of everything: Music, movies and apps. I'm actually glad I didn't go for the 64gb, as I'm perfectly happy with YouTube or streaming Netflix for a nominal monthly fee (more on this in a moment).Question #3: Is a refurbished iPad as good as a new one? Although I don't have a new one to compare, I'm going to say yes -- with one minor caveat. The refurbished iPads have new glass, a new back cover, a new battery, the same 1 year warranty, and go through the same rounds of testing that a new iPad goes through (if you buy from Apple directly, of course). And when you think about it, why wouldn't this be just as good as getting a new iPad? After all, even a new one could have flaws that might become apparent in the first year of ownership. There aren't guarantees with any device, and when you can knock 20% off the price and make a vote for recycling electronics -- better for the Earth -- why not do it, right? Oh, and the caveat? There are a couple of times I have come across some settings that were clearly from the previous user which is... a little odd. Nonetheless the pros outweigh this, so far as I'm concerned.All, told, if I had it to buy over again, I'd make precisely the same choices as this time: Black, 32gb, wifi, refurbished. So, onto the device itself....__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________THE IPAD:This is my first i-device, and I have always been a PC (Windows) user in the past, so it's an entirely new experience to me. I bought it primarily because when laptop shopping I ended up getting a fantastic deal on this behemoth of a wide screen laptop. Not portable at all... so what about when I'm at the coffee shop or the bookstore and I want to tinker around, check my mail, Facebook, etc. Here's where the idea of getting an iPad came in for me. I wanted an easy-to-carry, reasonably-sized, aesthetically pleasing (and here's where the competing devices were blown out of the water) device to fill my portable computing needs.Interestingly, some of the things I initially bought the iPad for are the same areas where the iPad falls short. I knew there would be no flash capability, and so expected this. In truth, it's not been much of an issue, and YouTube is way better on the YouTube-dedicated iPad program than it is on my flash-enabled Windows 7 laptop. But its the simple demands that are over-complicated by the iPad. Email is a bit tedious. Like the way that you can only delete one item at a time, see one folder at a time, can't do certain things like 'star' an email to make the level of importance or permanently relegate something to a junk mail category. Note: This refers to the included email program, but even if you do your email through Safari there's going to be a lot of awkward pinch-zooming to awkwardly replace the awkward lack of functions in Apple's email program. Similar issues arise with the Facebook app: It's hard to see who's online, for one thing. I can't share a story from someone else's wall to my own, and most infuriatingly -- if I post a comment, and hit enter too soon (easy to do with the on-screen keyboard layout-- backspace and send are way too close to one another) I can find no way of deleting it -- aside from opening Facebook in a browser window and trying to navigate the too-small text and awkward formatting, when this should be a an obvious and simple maneuver on the iPad app for Facebook. This is true of many apps that replace simple browsing, from eBay to Amazon to social networking. Most are beautiful, well-laid out, and missing at least one (often more) necessary function. And speaking of function, while zooming is a simple task, cutting and pasting is beyond annoying -- so much so that I often say 'hell with it' and don't bother copying things I otherwise would have. Apple needs to overhaul that function.It is the aesthetic beauty of the iPad that rescues it from a lesser star rating based on the lack of functionality inherent in some its apps/programs. I tried the Kindle Fire in the store and found it to be visually lacking in comparison -- and much slower as well. Meanwhile, the iPad is lightening fast with just about any task you set forth to do. It makes my laptop with better specs look like a dinosaur in contrast. The screen is breathtakingly beautiful (and unless you're trying to close out lots of open apps, incredibly responsive). It's so fun to just look at that you will find yourself wanting to store a photo library on there just to view the pictures on it. I love having pictures of my kids to show off on here for the older relatives at family get-togethers. It's definitely better than a traditional photo album -- and that sentiment comes from someone who is rather old-fashioned about anti-technological items like physical photo albums. Side note: My 300 moderately-sized photos are only eating about .5g of space. Another side note: The camera, while not graphically amazing, takes some of the speediest photos I've encountered with a digital device.Just as the iPad is able to display unparalleled beauty with photos, its video display is equally amazing. Since I care little for large-screen televisions, watching movies on here has actually made me consider getting rid of our two televisions. Netflix is convenient, the resolution and sound are perfect, and although the selection for streaming is quite limited, it fills our equally limited television needs. I haven't watched a single show on the television since I received the iPad, but I have watched the entire first season of Downton Abbey -- at my own convenience -- which was quite a luxury.Lastly, the apps that are built *specifically* for the iPad: The games (like Contre Jour, Angry Birds, Cut the Rope), Garage Band, and Drawing Pad are awesome toys to have on hand --and affordable (as well they should be, considering the cost of the device itself). There are endless free apps to play around with, download, play with a bit and often delete -- occasionally saving the really exceptional ones. This is a great bonus to owning the iPad. My husband has an iPod touch, and the apps are far more interesting on the iPad.There are even a number of educational apps that I didn't expect. I'm not one for computing for kids in most instances, and we stay away from all that LeapFrog and VTech madness -- instead opting for books. But I've been so impressed with apps like Solar Walk and Star Walk that I've been willing to make an exception. They're magical, and present really difficult concepts like the universe in a understandable way.Despite the iPad having some glaring flaws, I would buy it again. I believe now -- as I did when I chose it -- that it is the best tablet available. I can't stress how much I love perfection of the display. I've been pleasantly surprised by the unexpected things which it has been so handy for. I'd have loved to have known about its flaws in advance, which is why I write this review -- I hope someone else will go into their purchase feeling more informed and confident about their decision than I felt when I ordered mine. But if I had it to do again, I am pleased to say I'd make the same decisions all over again, so it was an easy 4 stars.", "Date": "January 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Will an iPad work for you?", "Author": "Artlover \"Experience It All\"", "ReviewID": "R35HWMRSKXH9XA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're deciding whether or not to buy an iPad 1 or iPad 2, you may want to read this first.  I've had an iPad 1 for 9 months.  Before I bought it, I doubted how much I would use it.  It had no hard drive, USB connectors, DVD player, camera, full keypad, ability to load major business software apps, ability to play flash-developed graphics, and it did not have much storage and memory space.  I wondered how it could be useful to me, since I had many Apple products - Mac Pro, Macbook Pro, iPhone, Mobile Me, Airport, Time Capsule, etc.To my delight the iPad provided 100x my wildest expectations.  Once you start using it for searching the Web and researching just about everything you do, you realize how much more you can get out of the Web and Internet every day.  You begin making tons of use of the Web and it makes you become way more productive in life (home, autos, service providers, education, children, parenting, illness, job, professionally, etc., etc., etc.).  It ends up becoming an extension of your hand, mind, and life.  It doesn't take you over, it merely helps you with everything you do.Email is also a different experience using an iPad.  You find yourself no longer reading email on your phone or computer.  You end up having your iPad with you, no matter where you are.  Email is extremely easy to read and is organized in way never thought possible.  I bring it in stores, theaters, healthcare providers, hair salon, work, lunch, and e v e r y w h e r e !!  it's way too easy to use and to make you much more productive.All this, and I haven't even gotten to the thousands of extremely useful and productive apps, movies, podcasts, music, etc., available (via iTunes).  You can have every type of app, from sophisticated business intelligence dashboard software to first class presentation software, to science, astronomy, and tons of world-class games.  All in addition to the new extension to your brain and hand (mentioned above).  So, don't get hung up about USBs, DVDs, and hard disks.  You can get a VGA cable, external camera connection cable, and a myriad of cases and multi-use devices.

I loved that movie for all the action and, of course the story, but more for the way that the creators of the film portrayed the future. All of the self driving cars, and gadgets that no one had ever thought of.Anyway, I was watching it the other day and the police chief guy with the bald head and glasses was carrying around something that looked like a book, but it had a screen. It seemed as if the screen was a touch screen, and he was having what appeared to be a video chat with another law enforcement agent on the thing. This was an idea of a gadget that the creators of the story and movie thought they would see in the distant future, like 2020's or 2030's. An awesome portable, touch screen device that had most, if not all the functionality of a PC, but smaller than a book. It's not 2020 something, though, and I realized that I had a much better, sleeker, and if I might say more futuristic looking device that performed as described right next to me. It was the iPad2.Now, I'm no Apple fanboy. Not in the least. I grew up using Windows machines at home, and my only experience with Apple before buying my first ipod touch 4G was in the \"computer lab\" in elementary school. But, last June I picked up the iPod touch 4G like I said, and I was blown away. It was so easy to use. So portable, so fast. I didn't like one thing, though, and it was the fact that the damn screen was too small to really use it for all the things that you could use it for other than just music and videos, like surfing the net, or using any of the million apps available. My hands were just too big.This was a problem. I don't have a lot of money to throw around, and the next step up on the Apple mobile line was the iPad2, and the 32GB version that I wanted was around $600! Thats a lot of money. And I already had an iPod, and at least two other Windows based machines that are very fast and up to date. It just didn't make sense to really buy the thing.I just kept falling more and more in love with the iPod touch, though, and more particularly with iOS and how well it performed. Everything worked and made sense. You wanted music, you hit the music \"button\" on the screen. Email you say? After you set up your account you just press the mail button. Pretty simple. The touch gestures are amazing too. The responsiveness and speed at which the device reacts is amazing. And its so smooth, people. Seriously, if you haven't handled an iOS5(when I got the ipod touch it was iOS4 i think, but the update is awesome) device you owe it to yourself to try it. Its incredible.But, I was still using that super tiny screen, and I couldn't send an email because my fingers would hit like 3 keys at a time and it would take a year to type it all out correctly. Surfing the net, although super fast and smooth, was horrible because typing a web address took a long time. What was I to do? I just gave up on using the iPod for anything other than media, and the occasional youtube video. I still played games on it, but even with the games, I really wanted a bigger, brighter screen.I started to look for reasons to buy the iPad2, and I couldn't come up with any. Not for about two months, at least, until my girlfriend said she needed a laptop and didn't really have any money to buy one. Bingo. I would give her the laptop, and even though she lives with me and I can still use the thing, I'll be down a machine and it leaves an opening for me to replace it. Right? Right!Off to my local retailer(sorry amazon)I go. 30 minutes later(store is literally right down the street from me) and I'm at home, updating the operating system and transferring all of my previous purchases and then I'm up and running. I was blown away.I knew what I was getting, a much bigger version of the iPod touch 4G. And, I got exactly that, and a whole lot more. First, the screen size is a huge plus. Much bigger than the iPod touch of course, and more than big enough to handle any number of tasks or games, or whatever. The keys on the touch screen keyboard are a really good size. No missed keys here people. And my fingers aren't small. The screen is so bright, and it just begs you to touch it. Movies and videos look great, and the web and all the apps are very vivid. This thing just looked great.It was lightweight too, and very thin. Physically this thing is like a very thin composition pad. Actually, much thinner than a composition book. About the same weight, though. Overall, the dimensions and weight make this thing ultra portable.If you're at all familiar with iOS you know about the apps, and they're pretty much all great. There are quite a few that are free as well, so don't let that stop you. In fact, some of the best games and apps available are free, or are just a buck so its not that bad. They range from super useful to super fun. Everything from photo transferring(desktop/laptop to ipad without USB)to remote desktop connection, to Grand Theft Auto is available, and almost anything you can think of has an app. Need a level? You can get one on your ipad for free. Want to tweak a photo? Get photo toaster jr for free and get tweaking. The apps are a real strong point for this device, and they make up for some of short comings of the device(more on that later.The battery last forever. Ten hours is more than enough for me. Plus you get a wall charger and a usb style hook up that you can use to hook up to your car if you have the adapter. Sweet.Like I said, processing speed is very quick, and it handles everything I throw at it all day long with no problems. Videos run without clipping or lag time and apps load up and run perfectly. I never have any freezes or crashes. Awesome.I can't say enough good things about this thing. Really. I can say few bad things as well. I wouldn't say bad, but you know, not what I would want from a \"perfect\" device.First, there are no USB ports. This sucks. There are apps that like I said earlier will help you transfer photos and videos, and documents, but it would be better if you could just plug directly in to the device.Second, you can't charge this thing with your laptop. Or I can't. It has to be plugged into the wall. Not too bad, but it sucks if you need to charge and you have laptop full of juice but no outlet.The biggest problem I have is the price point. Honestly, this thing is worth double what they want for it in my opinion. It will redefine how you look at computing in general. It is so much more intimate. But, even with that said, I think I have the right after purchasing to complain about the price a little. Again, worth every penny, but really pricey and I had to save up for the thing, and that sucks sometimes.Other than that, go buy this thing. Seriously. And shame on you if you think you can get what this thing delivers from a Kindle. Those guys are playing a very bad game of catch up. And they're going to lose. Think Android to compete with the iphone. I've used both. Androids are horrible. Epic fail. Now Amazon wants to lose money trying to compete with a legend. Trust me, if you want mobile, go Apple.

I tried the MOTOROLA XOOM Android Tablet (Wi-Fi) and was happy enough until I tried this iPad 2.  I love this updated version!  The only issue I had was trying to decide which version to get since there are many options.Storage capacity can be 16 GB, 32 GB or 64 GB.  I would recommend at least the 32 GB since you cannot expand the storage and although apps do not take up much space, I was amazed at the amount of stuff I loaded onto my iPad (photos, movies, music, documents, etc.).  Trying to save some money, I wondered if I should get wi-fi only or the wi-fi/3G combination and with which service provider, AT&T; or Verizon? Every iPad has wireless technology built in and automatically finds wi-fi networks easily but if you want to use it while traveling, the great outdoors or rural areas, wi-fi is not always an option.  If you have an iPhone 4, you can use it as a personal wi-fi hotspot for your iPad but your iPhone carrier might charge extra when this option is used.  Also, GPS is on the 3G models only, wi-fi provides an approximate location and this could be an issue if you love using Four Square or other GPS based applications.  More importantly, the wi-fi only model cuts your battery time down (~8 hours).  If you do choose wi-fi + 3G, I would check with AT&T; or Verizon networks for pricing before deciding.  Both seem to provide reasonable costs for domestic usage but international usage is outrageous.  The previous iPad allowed any carrier to be used overseas (which is a bargain) but I'm not sure if AT&T; and Verizon models allow for the same thing.This new version is lighter, faster, slimmer and has slightly longer battery life at 10 hours.  I love the brilliant LED backlit display on the 9.7 inch screen.  I'm still not a fan of Pages (iWork) but it is possible to get Word documents on your iPad through iTunes.  There is no official Microsoft version but being able to download Word documents from my pc to the iPad and work on them makes a huge difference for me. I really love the technological improvements that allows this iPad to know your every move and be more responsive.  No matter how you rotate this iPad, the display self adjusts - even if you place it upside down!  It makes playing games like Critter Ball that much more fun to play and allows viewing movies or reading a book in any position.  Need I comment about Apple apps?  They beat the Android and every other market out there on this score and help make Apple products first choice.For me, The only thing that prevents this tablet from being perfect is a better camera and the lack of Mozilla (I know this will never happen).  I have tried a lot of tablets and prefer this one over all others.  Yes, it is expensive but I consider it a good investment since it allows me to complete tasks on-the-go and help pass the time while waiting.  I think having this iPad along with an iPhone (or any smartphone) is the best combination.  Smartphones can provide information from the web but their small screen size can make viewing difficult and this iPad allows for a perfect union.", "Date": "April 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Much More Than the Novelty I Thought I was Buying", "Author": "D. Reinstein \"marindavid\"", "ReviewID": "RQTYDX3UXR5S3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After being tempted to buy a tablet for many months, when Apple introduced its new generation iPad and, at the same time, dropped the price of the earlier version, the iPad2 by $100 across-the-board, I jettisoned the thoughts about buying a relatively inexpensive Android device with a 7-8\" screen and bought the basic iPad2 with the minimal 16GB and WiFi only. Initially thinking that I was buying a new toy, a `novelty', I soon discovered that the iPad2 is much more than that. I use it for dozens of things I never imagined using one for and have become quite attached to it, especially when travelling or just sitting in my favorite easy chair at home.A great deal has been written about the technology and capacities of the iPads, so I will not waste your time reiterating them here. Suffice it to say that this one is the most basic model available. It requires a WiFi connection to operate and its total storage capacity is what seems like a `mere' 16GBs. My focus here is more on my personal experience with my first tablet. I am glad that I waited for the iPad.Being a 65 year old man, my are no longer nimble enough to manage the tiny keys on a Smart Phone nor is my vision acute enough to read things easily on a 3\" screen.  On the iPad, however, with its 9.7\" screen and keypad that is entirely adequate, I have become quickly facile.The limited memory is entirely adequate as I do not download and keep movies and am not an accumulator of music. The memory is needed to manage the necessary receiving elements of the various applications (Apps) that I choose to install the capacities for. Many are free, a lot of them cost between 99 cents and $3.99 and some cost more. The most expensive one I have is called \"Pages\" and is a comprehensive word processing and office management suite. Compared to the prices of `installable' programs, this is remarkable cheap. Some of my favorite apps are free, like voice recording capacities and \"GoSkyWatch\", an App that looks at the night sky through the out-facing camera and shows what constellations are there. It is like having my own telescope.The 20-30 Apps I currently have installed have used about 2GBs of the total available hard drive. I don't expect to run out. The exclusive use of WiFi vs. 3G has a pro and con to it. In the Pro column, WiFi is pretty universally available in most places and it requires no paid data plan to access the internet and use all of the iPad's features. On the Con side of the ledger, the device is usable ONLY where there is a WiFi connection available. With 3G and a data-plan, the iPad can connect from anywhere you can access a signal for your cell phone.At this time, for my own purposes, this basic iPad2 has been a rather surprising delight. I understand that the camera resolution on the third generation iPad is far superior, but what I see on this iPad2 is perfectly adequate for me - and, I expect, for most other people as well.The price is right and the product is truly outstanding.", "Date": "May 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "One Word:  Splashtop", "Author": "Mastodan \"Mastodan\"", "ReviewID": "RHCCZCFW5SYMZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "\"This sunlight is OK, I guess, I mean it provides all my food I suppose, but I have to give it zero stars out of 5 because I danced naked outside one day and it totally gave me a sunburn.\"I swear, this is what it sounds like when people complain about new technology.  Is there an astounding amount crammed into a small, considerably weight-reduced package? A resounding yes.  Are there some pretty impressive apps available for it?  Per this review's title, yes.  Is it a completely effective replacement for meaningful human contact?  No, but I'm reserving judgement for when generation 3 arrives with an optional mounting harness for love dolls.Look, its not perfect...realistically, it'll be a solid 4 or 5 years before a device in this price range can match the 160 gigs of an ipod classic with flash memory, and the dual core chip, while fine for day to day maneuvers, can lag in the more intensive tasks (not that there are many apps that convert things to DivX format or remotely control nuclear cooling towers).  Additionally, the lack of slots for SDHC or its 'micro' version knocks off a point or two for versatility.  Once data is on the thing, your only hope of exporting is via email or with third party software (and be REALLY careful to test it out with nothing crucial already installed, as there are some abysmal titles out there).  Also, I feel a decade of that proprietary cable is enough.Gripes aside, this thing is a joy to use.  The battery is every bit as good as people claim, my average use per charge is right between 11 and 12 hours.  No screen protector was included, but aftermarket options are plentiful, and the matte finish option I tried produces an incredibly natural response, especially when using a stylus.  Need to entertain a child 1-3 years of age?  Furry Friend is a fantastic app, and less than 2 dollars in the full version.  Splashtop, though, is the primary component of the 5 stars.  Full version is fairly inexpensive (intermittently goes on sale for 1.99), and it has saved me both time AND monitor life; Splashtop is remote control for your PC or MAC...nothing new there, those in the IT world have been doing this for some time, and its one of the features advertised for Windows 7 in particular.  But the versatility is the selling point.  You could be stuck at an airport, and edit a slew of photographs, browse on Firefox with your home presets/favorites, access anything your home computer can access, all with intutitive touch controls.With the sum of available science today, one could certainly design a device with more features and performance.  Sure it would cost a ridiculous sum, but ultimately, you get what you pay for.  I am a PC guy (only in computer preference), but I have to admit this is an impressive slab of glass and aluminum.  As for those claiming the purchase of an Apple product will designate you as a sheep or conformist, I applaud your staunch independence...just be sure you avoid any Meat, Fruits, Grains and Vegetables grown more than 50 miles from you, switch to a all-recycled burlap wardrobe, Handcraft your furniture from sustainably harvested logs downed with your own teeth, coat the whole thing with cruelty-free mud, and power your domicile with a small windmill and excercise bike hooked up to a homemade turbine.

I didn't see much utility for it and frankly thought it was a bit silly and I wasn't all for it. I didn't see much use for it although I recognized it was a nifty, cool little device but thought it was a bit too much like an Ipod touch. Forward to 2012 I now am the owner of an Ipad 2 and loving it, I'm converted. It wasn't until I had the opportunity to spend time experimenting and playing with the tablet that I saw myself using it me and bringing it along with me, in short wanting one. I've owned an Ipad for a little over two weeks and with this time passed by I've had enough time to enjoy and experiment enough with this device that now seems to be the right time to review it. If you must know I went for the Ipad 2 simply because I liked how remarkably slim and light it was and although the Ipad 3 has the new retina display, to me it didn't significantly expand the second generation of Apple tablets for me to pay a hundred dollars more (money is important after all and is a deciding factor) to have the \"new\" product I decided. I read reviews and articles, comparisons between the second and third generations of Ipad and came to the conclusion that I'd be well off with 16 GB Ipad 2 and from then on would decide whether or not to upgrade to one of the future Ipads depending on my use and enjoyment of the tablet.You can say all you want but no one presents and markets a product quite like Apple is capable of (and does). They're often criticized for how expensive their products are yet they are everywhere and well designed and thought and they're hard to ignore.  Apple had success with the Mac and Mac book and their different models, the Ipod, the Iphone (all with variations and updated models of the same product) and more recently with the Ipad. I'll be the first to admit Apple's gadgets and electronic devices can be expensive but I've also never had a problem with any apple product I've owned in the past.The size is one of the best thing about the Ipad, it's neither too big nor too small and the screen is big, bright and clear and there's just so much you can do. The interface is excellent; it feels and works great, looks neat and simplistic and it's very easy to catch on. It just feels natural and anyone from a child to a grandparent can use it and understand the bare basics an enjoy it. The applications or \"apps\" as they are called are truly what MAKE the Ipad the innovative device that it is, otherwise it does a lot of what your Iphone/Ipod touch or Laptop/Desktop do which is still keep in mind, excellent. There are ton of apps for different needs be it for reading books and magazines, to taking notes, playing fun games and everything in between. There are ton of apps already on the market, some brilliant and very useful to some downright stupid and new ones are constantly being created. Many apps are free, not most but a good quantity are and the range from the 0.99-1.99-2.99-3.99... 9.99 etc.  There are apps that serve as business tools, diverse utilities, fun mindless games like the popular Angry Birds, there's Safari as the internet browser, you can set up you e-mail accounts, manage your bank account, make hotel reservations etc. The list goes on please believe! There's of course Itunes from which you can buy music, movies and more and have them uploaded instantly to your Ipad. You can also sync it to any existing Itunes account and select material to upload to the device. I also like that there is both an inward and outward camera like on the Iphone so you can take pictures of anything you see or yourself which is a very nice option I thought I'd mention.  Those programs and apps are all stored in your Ipad via the memory it contains whether it's 16, 32 or 64 GB and ultimately the amount of Gigabytes you have determines how much content can be stored on the Ipad. The battery life is roughly ten hours (of course depending on certain factors such the brightness, volume etc.) which is not bad at all and still better than my laptop.These are just a few thoughts and suggestions if you're considering purchasing an Ipad.-  For me just the Wi-Fi model was fine. However, if you're often on the go and have a need for internet that can't wait and need it \"right now\" all the time without close Wi-Fi access available at all times then maybe you should consider getting a 3G model for just a little more $ with a monthly or pre-paid plan.-Another thing you might want to consider is the memory you're going to need. The 16G model has in reality 13.9 G (there is always a certain portion of available storage taken before even touch it) and I think for the average user this will be fine (besides you can always remove apps etc. and it does keep track of whatever you've downloaded in case you want it back). Most apps don't take up a whole lot of storage room although some are bigger than others. The same with music, it depends how much you plan to use the Ipad for music and this also applies to the books you buy and how many you plan to buy keep (although the books aren't as bad as the music and movies as far as I'm concerned, I wouldn't worry too much unless you're a hardcore reader who plans to store plenty of books).  If you're planning to upload a lot of movies or have/use a lot of data then perhaps a 32G or 64G model would be a better fit for you considering how movies can easily be over 1GB each. They're more expensive of course but may warrant the consideration if you'd rather have the larger number of Gigabytes but and not take the available space entirely than have one that's filled up soon after.-If you're interested in owning the latest thing and see potential great things about the Ipad 3 like the retina display and the upgraded processor you may want to go ahead with the newer model. Otherwise the second generation Ipad makes a viable option if you want to save a bit of money, other than that the two devices are basically identical and at first look no one could notice a difference between the 2 and 3. If you're considering either I suggest you do some research as I did, especially if money is an important factor in your decision and then decide for yourself which one it is you want.-Another somewhat big decision is the color choice, whether you want a black Ipad or a white one. Personally I went with the white one as I liked how it looked and it seems to me that most people I know own the black. The color is not all that important it's what it can do and the options it gives you although some will insist on owning either one color or the other.-Last you may want to protect the Ipad with a protective screen just in case (it's always better to be prepared) to protect it. You may want to consider purchasing a nice case to store and carry it and maybe even a stylus pen if you think you might be into that type of thing.In a world where tablets are rapidly and steadily selling Apple's Ipad has in reality very little competition partly due to clever marketing but mostly due to the great product they delivered.  Don't have a lot of negatives, if any, to say for the most part I am really liking it and find myself using it every single day and it nearly replaces my laptop. It does close to everything I want to do with my laptop usually, for me the Ipad is now one of those things tht I can't live without (not literally but still!).  I made the jump and find myself enjoying the Ipad and like it for its portability which makes it great for travelling and carrying wherever I go. It's entertaining, useful and smooth.  I like that I can have so much in one convenient sized device that doesn't take up a whole lot of space, can access wi-fi, check my e-mails, play games and more. It's not as big or heavy as a laptop, does not overheat even when running for several hours and opens MUCH faster yet it's not so small that it's inconvenient to type or a little hard to read (or touch in the case of my cellular phone) and do tasks with a cell phone, it's a perfect balance if you will. I really don't have anything negative to say about my Ipad, it would be nice in the future to have place for a USB/SD slot and I believe that may be coming eventually.

I have a couple of laptops and have owned a netbook for a couple of years. I bought the netbook because of its portability, size, and relative light weight when I am on the road.Throwing caution to the wind, I bought this  Ipad2 and it was instant love. Installation was a snap and took a matter of minutes per the instruction card which comes with the device as well as accompanying online prompts. There are a huge number of applications available for the IPad and many of them are free; others are available at minimal cost. The learning curve for using this device is fast; if you own an IPhone it is even faster. The platform this is built on is similar in operation to the IPhone. As for installing new apps, I have yet to encounter any installation problems with my add ons, though some people have.If you install the ereader app, it negates the need for a Kindle or Nook. While I'm not about to toss my Kindle, this is a nice alternative to carting around yet another device when I travel.The battery's charge is supposed to last about 10 hours. That is a fairly accurate measure as I've been averaging about 9 to 10 hours before draining the charge.The device's design is truly a work of art. While this is not a very constructive comment re: to buy or not to buy, I'm driven by aesthetics. I'm drawn to attractiveness and functionality. I own a lot of Apple products and their purchase has partially been driven on visual appeal and cleverness, though ultimately i have fallen in love with their ease of operation and their ability to go way beyond most folks'  imagination. What I am trying to say is that even if you buy this blindly assuming that it will do most of the things your laptop does you'll probably be surprised by its many added features. The  Ipad2 is very light and portable. It is easy to hold and with a smart cover or case that converts to a stand, it works great on a  flat surface or a lap. It can slip easily into a purse. I usually carry a small or medium Ameribag and have no problem getting it to fit. In order to keep this pad in pristine condition and safe, I installed a screen protector, a back cover, and a smart cover. For what it's worth, this pad is nifty but I wouldn't try to see if it will bounce if dropped. Additional accessories are readily available such as Bluetooth keyboards, headsets, and external speakers.The 32 GB capacity is more than adequate for my needs. However, an application junkie may need 64GB. I mention this because my son is upgrading because he wants to add more apps and is running out of space. 16GB or 32GB is probably adequate for most users.Response time is robust on this little sucker. While I didn't buy the 3G model, I haven't had a problem attaching to free WiFi and reception has always been good given that I'm usually in populous areas.The pad's sound quality is good as well as the screen's image. The camera is o.k., but I prefer my IPhone's camera or better yet a high res dedicated camera.While I had no previous experience with IPad's first incarnation, IPad2 seems to be an improvement over the first release due tofaster processing speed and a lighter and more compact design. While there is no slot for an SD card, I suspect that subsequent IPads will feature better and/or more sophisticated cameras and video conferencing capabilities, and an SD card slot among other things.Bottom line: the IPad2 is a fantastic device that is more versatile  than a netbook but lacks some of the functionality of a fully integrated laptop.

For various reasons I did not have an original iPad despite wanting one, so this review will focus on the iPad2 and not the differences between the two generations.1.  Screen.  The Screen on the iPad2 is gorgeous.  HD movies really do look HD, and the iPad2 provides a very satisfactory viewing experience.2.  Battery life:  Very good.  Despite moderately heavy \"on the road\" use, I have never managed to run my battery even to 50%.  Others are reporting 11-12 hours and this is consistent with what I am seeing.  Apple did a good job with this battery, and the overall power management of the iPad2.  I have my screen set to auto-dim (where the screen adapts to the lighting in the room) and no doubt this helps.  I have never needed or wanted to fiddle with the screen using this setting.  Ordinary Apple chargers work fine to charge the iPad2 battery.  However, many computer USB ports do not have enough juice to charge the iPad2.  My main Windows computer does not; not even from a powered USB hub.  Many third-party chargers for the iPhone turn out not to work with the iPad2 although all of the Apple ones I have tried do, and some of the after-market ones do.  So far my experience has been that if they sold it in the Apple store, it works.3.  Browsing the web.  The iPad2 is peerless for just plain web browsing, and this is what it excels at.  The virtual keyboard is OK for short email messages or filling in fields on websites.  For more heavy duty typing, there are a number of fine outboard keyboards out there.  I was delighted to find that my Apple Bluetooth Keyboard works splendidly with the iPad2 and for road trips I pack it along.4.  Cameras.  There are two; front and back.  They are exactly what you would expect: OK for quick snapshots, but a lens a fraction of an inch in diameter is not going to take the place of a real camera; we all know that.  They work reasonably well for what they are.  I have not yet tried the various videophone applications so I cannot speak to that.The iPad2 is thin and easy to carry.  The Apple case, which many people buy, is nice to have, but it does not protect the back of the iPad.  There are any number of aftermarket leather or other kinds of cases that provide the iPad2 with more protection.  Most of these will cause the iPad2 to power down when the front flap is closed, just as the Apple cover does.  This is a very nice feature.The iPad2 has infinite professional and personal uses.  I can have it in the courtroom (I am an attorney) and look up cases on-line quickly and snappily using the 3GS, since most courtrooms do not provide counsel with Wi-Fi.  Email, Web access, etc., these things are all becoming a fundamental part of our lives.  I used to use my iPhone for portable Web access, and it was OK for that, but the iPad2 with its larger screen is infinitely better for this.  In my life Web access wherever I go is the main use for the iPad2, and it is a critical use.My main negative on the iPad2 are these: 1.  No dedicated USB2 port.  Why not? 2.  The lack of a USB port makes it very difficult to print anything with the iPad2 and for some reason Apple does not make printing easy, or hardly even possible.  Apple flat-out does not encourage or want its iPad2 users to print off of their iPads.  Whether they are trying to protect their notebook sales or there is some other reason, I do not know.  Eventually I anticipate that competition and pressure from the user base (me!) will force Apple to relent on this.In the 21st century, devices like the iPad2 are destined to become a fundamental part of our personal kit.  The iPad2 is beautifully made, and for most of us very much worth having.  Highly recommended.  RJB.", "Date": "July 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Save your money.

Apple products are said to be easy to use but they don't live up to the hype. iTunes expects the user to know what to do. There are no clues as to how it should be used. All of that money and they can't even afford tool tips. I've spend an hour trying to figure out how to put a PDF into my iPad and it's like pulling teeth. A simple task made difficult by a bad design. Why can't I just drag and drop the files using Windows explorer like every other hardware product in the world? Why so difficult?Apple had an edge when they were first to market. Now they're relying on the loyal base and offer no advantages. Pay more and do less. Still no USB or SD card slots?

When I first started iTunes there was only one menu available and it was hidden under a graphic in the upper left corner of the app. I \"Added files to library\" from the menu and selected my PDFs. This made them appear in iTunes under Books but it didn't put them on my iPad even after several syncs and prayer.The solution(of course) was to select Show Menu Bar from the first menu to get a second menu (File, Edit, View, ...), then I could select View Side Bar to get a third menu I needed to add my PDFs. The first screen they appeared in was also labeled Books but it is obviously something different. After doing a sync the PDFs didn't appear in the Acrobat Reader where I expected them(why would they?) and I eventually found them in iBooks.The PDFs still won't appear in either of the PDF apps I installed.  Why not? This makes absolutely no sense. Easy? No.I tried using the iPad search feature but it can't find the PDFs that are on the iPad even though they show up in iBooks. The files are there. Why doesn't search find them? Because iPads are over priced JUNK! Basic functionality doesn't work.Apple products are supposed to be easy to use but they are far from it.Very disappointed.  Not designed well and lots of room for improvement. It makes me wonder what they've been working on for the last few years. It wasn't usability.------------------------------------------------------------------The more i use it, the more I hate it.  This weekend I received a message from iCloud Backup that has rendered my iPad completely useless.  When I tap OK to dismiss the message it keeps coming back. I can't dismiss the message, I can't interact with any apps, I can't power it down, I can't pull the battery. What am I supposed to do? Is this why everybody goes to the Apple store?", "Date": "February 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic!!!", "Author": "Di Angeli", "ReviewID": "R3V79ZEFTQT7CL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought a Samsung Galaxy Tablet a while ago, and it sucked Horribly.

Not to be outdone, I bought an iPad as well.  Now I thought I'd be using my iPad more than my Android, but this has turned out not to be the case.  You see,  Android and iPad are two very different devices, with one device often doing things much better than the other one.  So I've found myself using each device for different purposes, and I've found my Android device to be much more practical for everyday use.Here's a summary of my findings over two weeks of using both devices:OS Stability:  The winner here is the iPad.  I've experienced occasional freezes on the Android tablet, along with delays and slowdowns.  The only delay I've experienced on the iPad is when I'm using Safari and want to type in an address in the address bar.  There is a small delay from when I type the 'www' to when it shows up on the screen.  No big deal.Camera:  iPad is far and away the winning choice here, especially since my Android device came with a shabby VGA camera.  I can't speak for other devices like Galaxy Tab, but the iPad with its front and rear facing cameras definitely wins.Video Chat:  iPad.  Especially since my Android tablet doesn't, as yet, support this.Screen Resolution:  iPad.  What can I say about this, other than the difference is like night and day.  The Viziotab's screen resolution is, in a word, ugly.  It seems very one-dimensional compared to the iPad's.  The iPad screen is clear, bright, and attractive.Browsing:  I'm going to give this one to Android.  Although iPad's browsing is fast and Safari is easy to use, Android has flash.  Yes, I know, the resource hogging flash!  But here's the thing about flash for me: There are a couple of mission-critical websites I use constantly  one is for my job) that use flash.  With the iPad, it's a no go -- unless you buy a third-party browser that supports flash.  So Android wins here.Photos:  This is a toss up.  While iPad blows away Viziotab in terms of resolution, Android wins simply because you don't need to go through iTunes to sync your photo library.  I think I'll be using my iPad to share those photos from my recent trip to Hawaii, but if I need to 'manage' my photos I'll use my Android tablet.Video:  Again, a toss up.  iPad presents videos beautifully, but management is a pain in the a**.  First, iPad doesn't support all video formats.  And second, you have to sync your videos through iTunes.  So, if I have that iPad-compatible video of my trip to Egypt, I'll share it on iPad -- otherwise I'll be using my Android tablet to manage my video collection.Email: I was at first impressed by the iPad email app.  But I enjoy reading my email on Android.  Perhaps it's the Android's integrated GMail app, which makes viewing email a more pleasant experience.  iPad just seems awkward.  Android wins here.Downloading:  No contest here.  Android wins.  You can download anything to an Android tablet, including video and audio in multiple formats.  Android supports torrent downloading, too.  What can you download to iPad?  iTunes apps, music, and video, all of which come at a price.Games:  iPad wins.  I just can't see Android competing in this area.  Although I'm not a big mobile-device gamer, so it doesn't really matter to me.Bluetooth connectivity:  iPad supports Apple devices.  Android supports everyone's devices.  Android wins.Apps:  A toss up.  App store wins for number of apps, and for integration with iPad.  Market wins for functionality.  I like ebooks, for example, and have ebooks with Barnes and Noble and Kindle.  But Apple has hamstrung the Nook and Kindle apps buy taking away the ability to download books through the iPad apps.  And there will be no app available through the app store that duplicates any other functionality that would eat iinto Apple's profits.Viewing Videos on your HDTV:  With the purchase of a $5 HDTV cable I can view beautiful, high resolution movies and TV shows on my HDTV with my Viziotab.  With iPad you have to buy Apple TV ($99) and then are limited to iTunes store purchases.  Viziotab is the winner here.In conclusion, I like the iPad for its big, beautiful display and ease of use.  I don't like it for its limitations, like lack of bluetooth connectivity, file management capability, and file format support.  I will keep my iPad to share videos and photos of vacations, and to use if I have to video conference with someone.  Which will probably be never, but at least it's there!  And for the cool apps that I do like.  Not so much for browsing or file management.  If I were to have to choose between the two, I would choose Android simply because it is wide open compared to iPad. If I sit on the couch to surf, I'll use Android because I know there will be no artificial barrier between me and the world wide web.  And if I go on vacation, I will take the Android with me for compatibility reasons.Buying advice: If you're an Apple user already and are immersed in the Apple ecosystem of products and services, compatibility probably is not an issue for you, so I would choose iPad.  If, however, you're not an Apple user I would carefully weigh the compatibility issues.  The iPad effect wears off eventually, and you have to realize the iPad is a device that does some things really well, other things not so well, and a few things not at all.  If those things it does 'not at all' are things you need it to do, then you might be well advised to get one of the Android tablets to better serve your needs.  Or, if you're like me and can afford it, why not get both?", "Date": "October 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "After a couple of Android tablets, this is the one", "Author": "Ricardo Chavarria \"RCP\"", "ReviewID": "R1LZCKQZS24E80", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a developer and Android fan who also happens to have and Android phone which I love. So I was looking for the same experience in a tablet, and mostly because of Android being open and the fact that I may be able to apply custom roms, etc. After researching a lot, months ago I found the Androids tablet to be superior, or so I thought, to the iPad. Thats because I compared the hardware specs, usb support, etc. So I bought an Archos tablet first and then a GTab. But to be honest, the experience was never fluid or at least not near to what I was used in my phone. The UI is very laggy and there are too many bugs still. After a while I couldnt stand it anymore and I sold them. I think the problem is the software, Android, which is evolving and is still not ready for primetime, though I do think it will be sometime given the currnt trend.So I decided to give the iPad a try. And it was worth it. The experience of this product is amazing, everything is crisp and fluid, even with less hardware than the Android ones. There's just no way to compare the OS in this regard. The iPad offers the best experience for a tablet today. If you don't believe me go and try one for at least 30 mins. I know that Apple is closed and all of those things I also hate, but still, the experience of using this device is so amazing it outweights other purely inellectual aspects, at least for me it does.If you want a tablet that is fluid, reliable and just works, buy the iPad. Even the iPad 1 will do. If you want to play with roms and don't mind the bugs and UI freezes and basically don't mind spending time debugging usability issues, buy and Android tablet for the nice things like USB integration and openess.For now I'll stick to Android for phones and to Apple for tablets.

VonCamper", "ReviewID": "R2LAI9RDEW7FTF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "(Caveat: I'm not a techie dude (though I do enjoy some techno music... go figure, right?) so proceed cautiously with my review...)I've been brought to the iPad dragging my heels, kicking and screaming, like a bratty toddler told to eat his peas (I hate peas).My history: I've not been a fan of the proprietary and I love music.  Some years ago, before my kids bought an iPod... I owned a Creative Zen Vision M MP3 player... 60 gigs that thing carried... and I could download whatever I wanted into it... no proprietary poo and nobody needed to know my financial information or address, and I loved that lil device for that freedom.  Creative created a great product, and in fact they own a couple of patents that enable certain Apple products to work, but like Beta recording tape... a technology that was superior to VHS, yet it was popularity of the lessor product that eventually killed the chances of the better device ever really taking hold.  Similarly, from a freedom point of view.. seems like much of the MP3 market has gone the way of the dinosaur, losing out to the proprietary Apple name.  And so begins my review.To recap: I hate proprietary.  And Apple IS that: proprietary.  Having said this, and yielding to my better senses, I have made allowance to bend towards the Apple by initially purchasing my iPhone.  I still hate the proprietary... love the device; Apple, begrudgingly liked by me for the things they build, made such a great device in the iPhone that I decided to take the leap by swallowing the whole schtick and bought this iPad.This second generation, 16 gig, iPad purchase was a big one for our family... actually, for my wife (as a birthday present to her), and she's been tethered to it for two days... loves it.It's a nice sized tablet... much easier to surf the internet with a larger screen than that of an iPhone, so that's a nice plus.  As for their proprietary... if you move to Apple with the purchase of your own iPad, you'll have to give them information... personal information, to include credit card, and normally that's enough to stop me in my tracks, so if you're like me and don't easily want to part with giving this info out... this isn't the tablet for you.  But before you consider not buying this tablet for that reason, remember that once you do give in, you're introduced to a world of great products and support.As far as functionability... this iPad is basically a picture/video taking wi-fi accessing internet surfing tool (nice run-on).  Conceptually, the tablet is intuitive in it's function... if you already own an iPod/iPhone/iPad.... yet if you don't, navigation/use of this tablet is pretty easy to learn... easier still if you have someone that owns one helping you for the first 2 mins.What makes this device interesting is the ability to add applications (apps) that enable you to do a millions things with this device.  Some apps are free while some cost money... and they're found once you hit the \"App Store\" icon on your device.My iPad was purchased with the wi-fi connectibility option only; I wasn't interested in purchasing (another...) 3g AT&T; smart device usage fee, though it's an option (another model...).  As for internet connectibility, I just have to find a wi-fi site and wahla... connection, at no extra cost to me.  Sure, this doesn't make the tablet very usable while in motion, but that's not a big deal for my usage intent... so this really doesn't effect me as it would someone who's occupation relies on such mobility usage (did that make sense?  Hope so...).This tablet comes with 16 gigs of memory (same as my phone...); I have hundreds of photos and some video on my phone, but no music.  If you have an ample music collection you would like to carry/keep on this iPad, I might suggest you purchase one with a higher storage capability.  This iPad will be used by my wife and she's going to stick pictures on it, perhaps SOME music, but not much between the two; for her, 16 gigs is just right.As for other functions: it's got a camera (don't ask me for specs... look them up.  New generation iPads have newer iris'/greater photo capabilities), that can also take video.  I can do a video type conferencing with another Apple device (another iPhone/iPad, for example)... it's called \"facetime\"... that's a neat feature that my 4 year old loves when I'm at work for two days or more at a time.  Battery life seems good... charging is a snap; USB or wall... you can do both with hardware supplied.Importantly, and to their credit... Apple does a great job supporting their products (my experience with a problematic iPhone, handled by Apple Care... was top-notch).  They take care of warrantied items very well.  An additional note: Apple stores, if you 've got one close-by... are a great resource for handling warranty/problematic software issues... so the support for the product, in-store or not, is there.As for iPads or tablets in general... there are others, but even this second generation iPad makes internet connection, and use, a breeze.  After owning now... two devices, I'm a believer in the products that Apple (thus far...) have made... and though I STILL don't dig the proprietary thing, it's a reasonable trade-off for being able to use a pretty great device.I hope this review assists you in making your choice, whichever that choice may be.  Thanks for listening.", "Date": "April 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing product that I can't give 5 stars", "Author": "Marlon R.", "ReviewID": "RZ7FL90SYZDPU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There's no question the iPad is an amazing device. Life is better now that I own one. With all the hype about it though I really expected it to be slightly better than it is.  It's hard to rate this exactly 3 or 4 stars so I'd rank it closer to four. Below summarizes why.PROs:It's amazingly fast.Amazing battery life and the exact battery remaining percentage icon is a great feature instead of the usual cellphone-like icon showing a quarter, half, etc. Battery life is really one of the best things about it.It turns on instantly and is ready for anything. Shuts down and sleeps just as quick. You almost never have to shut it down to undo a lockup. Notice I said \"almost\".Loads websites fast, and almost all apps work problem-free.Tons of content available, much of it free or just $.99Built well and damn-near bulletproof case. It looks sleek and you don't want to put it down once you start using it.It's lightweight and I don't notice it getting hot. So much more pleasant to use on the couch than a laptop. If you haven't spent an evening browsing the net from your couch with the iPad, you don't know what you're missing.CONs:Sadly the cons are quite significant in my mind. Doesn't mean I'm taking it back but kind of amazing that Apple didn't address this with the ipad2. First, the lack of flash support on the iPad is HIGHLY ANNOYING.  I cannot overstate this. I have read many reviews and talked to enough fan-boys that tell me flash is outdated and isn't going to be used much longer, HTML 5 will replace it, on and on. To that I say YEAH RIGHT.  Flash is everywhere. Many major corporations and product companies use flash on their sites. If you cant run it, you WILL miss out on content. I had no idea how big this was until i got an ipad.If you use amazon you need flash. Otherwise forget watching any product videos. To have to move to a desktop because my tablet won't do flash is unacceptable. I have heard that apple chose not to allow it due to battery life issues, but this doesn't seem like a valid enough point. It's probably more than this: political between adobe and apple. Here's a newsFLASH: how about just giving us the option to turn flash browsing off if battery life is the real reason? Maybe I'd rather have four hrs of battery life and be able to watch video than have 10 hrs of battery. This is the most glaring problem with the iPad and if you are in the market for a tablet, do your comparison shopping and check the android tablets before you decide. Wish I had. This is a problem I encounter almost every day.Lack of a back button-there is not always a way to 'back out' of an application on the ipad as there is with other tablets, again namely the android tablets. Sometimes you get knee deep in an application and hit a wall, the only way out is to hit the home bezel button which means you have to close and  start the app over. With other tablets you just go back one step.  Not a huge annoyance, but annoying nonetheless and probably happens every other day or so.Text ain't that sharp-I thought for sure owning an iPad I'd have razor sharp text just like the razor sharp graphics on the rest of the unit. Not so. Text is just 'ok'.  I just find myself having to blow things up sometime to view them clearly, and I have good vision. This may be a little knit picky... Text is fairly sharp as you enlarge and stretch content. I have read some other reviews touting sharper text on competing tablets though.Safari ain't that great either-safari is extremely limited and again apple won't let you have Firefox for the iPad. Basically I think safari provides a far less pleasing browsing experience. My main gripe is that safari will not 'wordwrap'. This means when you zoom in on a web pages the article will stroll horizontally which means extra work to have to read it. (Your home computer will wrap the text automatically, meaning the article or web page way get longer in length, but stays  only one screen length in width.... This makes for an easier reading experience).If you do lots of reading online this can get tiring constantly having to scroll horizontally as well as vertically without word wrap. This isn't a problem on the kindle fire and android phones, I presume it isn't a problem on their tablets, either.The war against Google-it's no secret apple and Google will one day be even more of direct competitors than they are now, and I find that gmail sometimes just will not open on the iPad. It hangs up and locks up the unit, and I mean LOCKS UP the unit rendering the rest of safari useless until I can get it to calm down and close out.  I have no idea why but gmail is the only website that gives me a problem in safari. It's annoying and I feel unnecessary.  it's not my Internet and not my WiFi either because it works on every other computer and device in the house.  There is a gmail app, but I share the tablet with other people and kids and I want my email access separately in a browser. Sadly gmail and the iPad don't mix and that sucks.SUMMARY:Despite the gripes above the iPad is still a marvelous machine, albeit not perfect. It's loads better than using a laptop for daily surf and email. You probably won't regret buying one, and if you do the high resale value means you'll have not problem unloading it. If you are a Google or android user, you do owe it to yourself to check out the android tablets side by side before making a purchase. I can tell you for sure that for browsing the net and reading articles, Google's android built in browser is loads better than safari.  I think the iPad had been incorrectly assumed as being vastly superior because it's apple, but it has some major flaws.However even with those it is still as a whole a superb machine. It's an amazing piece of technology and far superior for web browsing than a computer or laptop. Just a personal tip--if you're on the fence about what color to get, go with white. Black is cool too, but white will stay looking cleaner (black shows every fingerprint) and will not show little nicks and scratches on the case like black will.Thanks for reading.", "Date": "July 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "thought I was buying new product", "Author": "edsnpw", "ReviewID": "R33LNBFFDXLG3Q", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was in the process of purchasing 26 iPad 2s over a period of 3 months for my employer when Apple switched to the new model and stopped selling the iPad 2 32GB that I need.

Not quite perfect, but good enough for me.", "Author": "Leo Stark", "ReviewID": "R4HF0MLW53MX8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So I got my iPad 2 the first Friday of summer 2011, and have been loving it ever since. I use it for school (I'm practically paperless) and for entertainment. I got the 32 gigabyte model because I store a lot of apps, music, and pictures (from memebase, damn memebase.) With out further ado, here is my full review.Hardware: the hardware for the iPad is great. The aluminum body is sleek, strong, and stylish. I feel very confident in the Apple build quality to withstand most of the things I do. The plastic on the iPad is very little, and still strong. It has your usual 30 pin port on the bottom, which is huge and I don't see why they don't make a smaller one. If you liked charging your iDevice with your computer, tough luck. Only a new MacBook Pro or a new iMac can charge the iPad 2.  I have neither. All in all, I give the hardware an A+.Cases: A case is needed, however. My case is leather, and I got it for the magnetic closure, but for my use, it just isn't sturdy enough. Right now. I'm using rooCASE Dual Station Premium Leather (Magenta) Case Cover with Stand for Apple iPad 2 / iPad 3 / The new iPad in red; I couldn't find the red one in the product link section. With out a case or with a poor case, the corners will get pretty scuffed up and ugly. Also, on mine, the black plastic color part is kind of peeling. It's not that bad, though. Mind you that i'm a student, so I might do more things than you do. I recommend you get the Speck Products CandyShell Wrap for iPad 2 - DarkLord Black (SPK-A0418). I just ordered it from Amazon $20 cheaper than from the Speck site.iOS 5: I am at iOS 5.0.1, and for some reason, my iPad won't let me upgrade to 5.1. There isn't a huge difference, so don't feel like you are missing out.  The iOS is great. Everything is smooth, and the Internet browsing is great with the tabs. You can even split the keyboard in two and type with your thumbs, which is,neat, but not useful until you really learn how to use it. iCloud is also great. Every app I download on my iPhone gets downloaded on my iPad, and vice versa. Really useful. Still no freaking flash, though. There is an app you can download called Photon flash web browser, which lets you run flash programs. Really great for watching FLASH videos, if you know what I mean. I HAD TO! I HAD TO! I'm sorry. That was the dumbest thing ever, but you get what I mean. I rate the OS an A-Battery: I love the battery life, and at school, if I don't use it a lot, I can use it for another day. It has by far the best battery life of any LCD screen device I have. 'nuff said, A+Speed: the iPad is super quick with its A5 processor, running apps like a charm and browsing the Internet sometimes faster than my laptop. Hell. It is  probably is faster than my laptop. If you want something fast, it's definitely something to consider. A+Weight: not too heavy, but not too light either. Feels perfect. It fits in my booksack, so it's good for me. AOne thing that makes me rate it 4 stars is the AirPrint or whatever Apple calls it. (my iPad recognized the word and spellchecked it, so I think I that's right) It's complete crap. There are only a select few printers that it can print to, and you have to jailbreak if you want otherwise. It's so dumb, and I print things a lot. I truly hate it. I am soon going to buy the network printing app on Cydia, so that will soon be gone, but still. Bad choice, Apple.All in all, I rate the iPad 2 an A. If you want to save some money, buy the iPad 2 instead of the new iPad, but if it's your starting model and you don't care about the price, go with the  Apple iPad MD328LL/A (16GB, Wi-Fi, White) NEWEST MODEL. The only reason to but this one is if you are price-conscious and the new iPad is too much for you. The iPad 2 is still great,but the display on the new one and the better proccessor make it a better buy.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Versatile and Powerful", "Author": "Jeffrey A.

The iPad 2 is sleeker, much thinner and lighter.  These are big differences if you plan on doing a lot of reading on the device and need to hold it for extended periods of time.  The camera is a nice-to-have addition.  The iPhone 4 has a better camera and is easier to use when taking pictures - the iPad is a bit bulky to use as a camera.  Also, for me, cellular connectivity is a must since I travel frequently and can't always rely on a WiFi signal.  Cellular data plans are about $25/month, so if you don't need it, you can save a fair bit of money.  I might still recommend getting the device with the cellular antenna - you can enable it when you need it and cancel data plans when you don't.

I have a Windows phone paired with a Mac computer.  So, I generally buy products based on the product rather than the company. At first, I was completely against getting an iPad, since I figured that my Mac could do anything that my phone couldn't. I broke down my favorite aspects and least favorite aspects of the iPad 2 (not software, but hardware):Favorites:1) The weight distribution of the tablet: It doesn't seem to be too heavy, or too light (as in cheap).2) Materials: I was leaning more toward a Android tablet, but the materials that went into those felt so cheap to me. The iPad 2 has a great aluminum feel to the back, with a glossy front.  I miss the Gorilla Glass of my Samsung phones though, since I never needed a screen protector.3) Everything just works:  If you have ever had an Android phone, you understand what I mean. Occasionally, the Android OS just freezes, or crashes (at least on my previous phone).  When you press the home button, there is no lag.  This has more to do with the software of the iPad (iOS 5). True, it is more of a restricted OS than the Android OS, but its a sacrifice I was willing to make.4) The prestige that comes with an iPad:  This may sound shallow, but I didn't not want to have to defend my position of getting an Android tablet over an iPad.  This holds its value long into the future, verses lesser known Android tablets.5) Clean lines:  A minimalistic design.  Clean cut, very stylish.Least Favorite:1) True, the iPad is very balanced, but it does get heavy when reading after awhile.  If you are looking for an ereader and won't be going into the features of the iPad, then don't buy it.  Buy the Kindle Fire or another device.2) Every accessory seems to be (excluding a few of course) very expensive.  If you want a good deal, you have to be willing to hunt for awhile, buy used, or pony up the extra money to buy the protective case, or screen protector, etc.3) I still feel nervous carrying it around with me. Its a double edge sword... yes, I love the prestige that comes with the ipad, but so do the thieves.Overall, this review isn't going to make someone who doesn't want one, buy an iPad.

A. Luster \"The Rook\"", "ReviewID": "R3DDO9RE3KWXA3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Apple's iPad 2 is a huge hit at our house. My wife got one and I was so jealous I insisted I needed one as well. The uses are almost limitless. Best of all it is great for creating documents (writing novels), surfing the web, listening to music, and playing Apple games. In fact I only have one complaint about the lack of compatability with the Adobe Flash Player. Because of this it keeps you from playing a great many games including those on Facebook and other sites. Additionally certain videos at some sites will only play with the Adobe Flash Player. I hope in the interest of customer needs this will change in the future. Otherwise I am very satisfied with the iPad 2. I even got a Rover App-Controlled Spy Tank with Night Vision to remotely control with the iPad so my wife and I can watch the house and cats remotely. That brings some peace of mind, not to mention the Rover is a blast to play with.You can purchase cases and accessories to attach your iPad to your cars headrest to allow others to watch movies while traveling. There are a plethora of accessories for the iPad 2 so you will have plenty to choose from for covers, cases, adaptors, keyboards, et cetera. There are numerous apps that you can download to make it great for work and/or play. The apps can be free or range up to about twenty dollars on average. Most those I got were free or around four to seven dollars. I use mine extinsively because I can carry it anywhere and I don't have to sit at a desk to work on projects or listen to music and play games. If you're a highly mobile person this is a must have tool/toy.I imagine most students want one to make their homework easier to work on at school or home. Because of the decent drive space and WiFi you can almost do anything that you could do on a full size workstation whether you use a PC or Mac. Since you can even buy cases with keyboards it can easily replace a laptop for a lot less money and portability. Small enough to carry in a daily planner or purse it wins hands down in portability. Since you can now back files up on the web and use webmail it alleviates the headaches of more complex and costly workstation choices. You will still require a workstation to interface with for printing, transferring some files, USB transfers, and certain other functions. But at least when you need portability you will have it.Addendum: Although I am slightly disappointed that the iPad 3 came out on the heals of my purchase, I can't complain really as mine was purchased more for functionality than graphics.  One reader asked me if the WiFi was an issue to set up.  I didn't have any trouble with it.  In fact it's far easier than setting it up on a PC.  Once you set it up it automatically goes out and looks for a connection and will ask you which server to connect.  The beauty of it is if you decide you don't want to pay a monthly fee is you can just disable it until you want to use that feature again.  Now that the price has dropped on them, unless you need high resolution for movies or graphics, I recommend you seriously consider the iPad 2.CA Luster", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Boy, Did I surprise her!", "Author": "Brian J.

I would tell people \"I have an iPhone so why get just a bigger version?\"  My wife wanted to get an e-reader so I decided to put my money where my mouth was and buy a couple of iPads for us.  Hers would likely be a casual use device but I was going to try to use mine for business moving to a paperless work style (attempt #1,324 over the course of 12 years of different devices).Initial review was good... liked the device feel, weight, etc.  Clearly it looked nice.  I was offended at the cost of covers and accessories but I had somewhat gotten over that shock with the iPhone so it wasn't a new shock :) I felt that a lot of the app makers did a good job with their iPhone/iPad combined apps but it does suck to have to buy a separate app for those that don't have the combined versions.  But, overall a nice design and fun product to use.But, there's a big but here, it's too fragile and no recourse from an accident.  Like many others before me I broke mine.  Total bone-head move on my part, not at all an Apple fault in my situation, but if you spend some time reviewing forums you'll see the advice I failed to read.  The device is incredibly fragile so even simple (aka not bone-headed) slips, drops, and bumps will leave you with a busted screen.  With no attractive means of recourse.  One would think that any product with a propensity for a major functional piece to break there would be a repair option.  Not the case with Apple.  Probably part of the business plan to be honest.  I tried to find out my options and costs (secretly hoping for a free replacement like others have touted) but two different stores told me 1) not repairable by anyone; 2) any signs or attempt at repair void warranty; and 3) only option is a \"courtesy\" replacement for $270 (16mb wifi version).  No option for repair internally at Apple, let alone an option more reasonable than spending another $300.  I checked and the local repair place quoted about $185 plus tax and the parts I found online looked to run about $150+.  For a glass screen!Apple has a unique luxury in that they have a large client base that feels Apple can do no wrong.  An Apple \"genius\" could swing by the house at Thanksgiving and slap the loyalists grandmother and Apple would still be held up on a pedestal - the turkey was dry after-all.  So they don't bat an eye if iTunes misbehaves (the user shouldn't have tried to sync contacts), or if they try to connect with Outlook (the user shouldn't consider another product not made by Apple), or consider a good product would have given repair considerations to a critical yet fragile component.  The Apple flock is a great thing to have for a business.So anyway, I would say the iPad is a great device.  It'd be better if the screen were more widget based like the android options, but it's snazzy, quick, and a joy to use.  But, leave it sitting alone on the desk and protect it with your life if you buy it.  Otherwise buy an android option for half the price and if you could bust it three times and still be less expensive than the Apple will arguably as good of performance.", "Date": "December 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Happy", "Author": "Timmy", "ReviewID": "R26TTFEDFP6YHG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Okay so I ordered two iPad 2's, both refurbished one white one black.

Instead I want to share my experiences living with the iPad 2 for about a year now.The main use for this device has been web surfing while sitting on the couch in front of the TV.  There's no doubt that we're moving to a multi-screen world and it's nice to be able to look something up on IMDB.com when watching something on TV or to check your email during a commercial break while watching a ballgame.  It is not my main web surfing machine, I don't have the best eyes and I'm addicted to my 24\" screen on my desktop, but the iPad does nicely for light web use.As an e-reader the iPad 2 isn't horrible, it's just nowhere near as good as a Kindle which means the only things that really get read on the iPad are books I have in PDF files, such as a Photoshop manual where having a nice color display really helps.  We've read some magazines on it, but the screen is really too small to make the a comfortable experience for me.  Your mileage may vary here as some people I know love reading magazines on an iPad.  For me, that experience will be better when there is an iPad that has about a 12\" screen size.One thing the iPad is really good at is playing videos.  With streaming apps getting better and better, like the HBO GO app, it's making the iPad more and more useful.  It's nice to be able to take your content anywhere you want in the house.  The screen is absolutely beautiful for playing video content, and once again for extended viewing I'd like a screen that's just a tad bigger than this current one.The performance of the iPad 2 is very nice, everything feels snappy and I've really never felt like the processor was being bogged down while using it.  It feels very nice in the hand and is very sturdy.There is no doubt about it, tablets are useful and they're entertaining but I don't see them ever replacing desktops or laptops for me.  I do a lot of design work though, so my needs are different than most people.  If you're looking for something to check email, surf the web and catch some video content then the iPad will be perfect for those needs.The bottom line is if you're going to get a tablet it's still hard to beat an iPad.", "Date": "November 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "iPad 2 WiFi", "Author": "baydogs", "ReviewID": "RSDSQK2UZUWTA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have never had Apple products except for an iPod.

Basically, its functionality is somewhere between an iphone and a laptop. The first issue that I have with it is that it is expensive and does not fit in my pocket. That means that if I go to town, I really can not take it with me because I would be afraid if I set it down or took my eyes off of it for a minute it would get stolen. I can not walk around holding it all day, so pretty much I have to leave it at home. When I am at home, I have a computer in just about every room, so really dont know what I need the ipad for. It does not really do anything that a computer does not already do.When I travel, space in the carry on bag is a premium. I tried travelling once with this, and leaving the laptop at home, and it was a disaster. It will handle routine email, but if you need to edit a document, or interact with a web site that has flash, you are out of luck. I went to Africa with this instead of a laptop, and ended up on the phone for long periods trying to get someone back in the states to handle the business items I could not do on the ipad. So, when I travel if I already have to take an iphone and a laptop, what niche does the ipad fill?In optimizing my carry on for travel, I take an iphone, a small laptop, a good Sony camcorder, and the canon powershot elph.

After converting to an iPhone and iMac last year, it seemed the logical next step.The true selling point is its portability. In bed, on the couch in front of the TV, and definitely for traveling-- this is a great accessory for checking email, Facebook, and browsing the web. The interface is simple and the display is great.The cons are minimal. As an e-reader, the backlit display is hard on the eyes, so I find myself going back to my Kindle with its e-ink screen. And I find myself reminded that the iPad is probably closer to an iPhone than a computer because it limits some of the videos you may want to see since there is no way to get the Flash Player plug-in, which so many sites require. YouTube and Netflix, however, work just fine.  Although it was a bit frustrating when I paid for in flight wifi on a plane yesterday and still could not properly load a Netflix video.Overall, though, the iPad does exactly what it says it will do, which is giving the user a computer experience more personal and portable than a laptop.

I was originally against it and bought the Asus Transformer first. It's not the greatest thing in the world, but the operating system and features are good in their own way. I might one day sell it and buy a Prime, since I like certain things about Android better. The main part that I don't like is the speed it operates at. (Lags a lot). But this is not about Android; it's about the iPad.Ok, so the main reason that I was against the iPad and Apple products was it's use of slave children to make them and the exclusivity of the operating system. Slave children part? Still an issue. But the main reason I ended up buying one was the promise of Apple of making textbooks for college available on them. I had waited so long for it, too. How convenient is that? No more aching back and such. SSOOOOOOOO nice! And the exclusivity of the operating system? It's honestly not as bad as people had made it out to be. For the most part, things work really well in all aspects for the iPad and there's really only a few websites that I have gone to that don't play videos. I don't play flash games, so that's not an issue. But for reals, the iPad has the best apps and they're tailored specifically for it. The best example is Splashtop, which remotely accesses your computer. It certainly is NOT optimized for the Transformer. The greatest thing is that I can actually watch movies streamed from my computer in bed! When it comes to the processing power, I have been told that the components are the same for both of my tablets, but the iPad plays streaming video a whole lot better. And it also does just about everything better.....except for the widgets. Why can't Apple design widgets for the iPad??? That's why I like the operating system of Android better, plus you can customize it better and surf files better and generally get a more user-oriented experience. Once again though, the apps for iPad ARE better and there ARE more of them, (though not a whole lot). It quickly does hit a brick wall and the apps fall dramatically in quality. Most of the apps that are truly useful, you will find on both. Itunes though is a b*tch and I truly do not enjoy using it. This cuts back to the point I made that files are easier to work with on Android products. If you can climb successfully up the iTunes learning curve, you will do well, but you shouldn't enjoy it, if my experience is anything to go on. So, that's about all I have to rant about right now. If you're like me, you'll just blow your money and get an Apple product AND and Android product. Both good, but for now, the iPad is MUCH better. I swear, sometimes I just want to hold it and fall asleep with it. Oh, and just as a quick afterthought, the next generation of iPads need more quick-access buttons, just like Android. There should be a menu button, back button, (that doesn't just take you back to the main screen), and a quick-switch multitasking button. If they did this, the iPad would truly reign supreme.

Hui", "ReviewID": "R3HY8KYKA5S8WX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I initially didn't upgrade my iPad 1 to the 2nd generation as it was \"good enough\" for my needs. But as time went by and iOS5 was released I found my iPad 1 a bit lacking... Safari would often crash and more recent games such as Infinite Blade (the first one) wouldn't even load without crashing. It was becoming that I was getting a bit miffed with my iPad so I sold it off recently to wait for the iPad 3. Without an iPad in my life there was a bit of a void and I took advantage of one of the many resllers of the iPad 2 in the Marketplace. I found a great deal for a perfectly mint condition iPad and I have to say I am loving my iPad 2. No more crashing, the iPad 2 is really FAST and I feel it will be a bit more \"future proof\" for next year's iOS6 and even iOS7.Though it doesn't have the rumored retina display of the iPad 3 I feel that if you can get an iPad 2 for less than retail price right now it is well worth the purchase, even this close to the release of the next incarnation. Not to mention that a retina display for a device this large is less important than on an iPhone where the image size is much smaller. The only thing a Retina display will improve is the reading of ebooks and honestly not by that much. It's not as if it goes from illegible to crystal clear, just slightly more crisp... and for my needs not as necessary since I don't read much on my iPad to begin with. Also remember higher resolution also means more battery usage... so unless they put a bigger battery in the next iPad the battery life will be impacted. If they put a larger battery then the iPad 3 itself will be larger.Which leads to another thing I love about the iPad 2, the size! It is insanely thin compared to the first iPad and quite a bit lighter in hand. Now my left arm will have less of a work out when I'm standing and working on the iPad. :PMirroring with an Apple TV is beyond fun and a great feature for those of you who want a HTPC but don't want to deal with the high prices of Mac Mini or a Windows HTPC. Now I can surf the web on my TV and stream (soon to be) any video found on the internet. As Apple declared Flash video is on the down swing and soon it'll bow out of the way to h.264 as the go to streaming media format.The iPad 3 will no doubt be great... and I'm sure I will upgrade to it too...

Though there were features on the Magazine case that I will miss (3rd standing option that was between the vertical mode and the keyboard mode) this is by far the best looking feeling and quality full body protection that I have seen for any of the iPads. I loved the idea of the Smart Cover but hated the price and the fact there was no back protection. Also heard that the magnetic connectors end up scratching the iPad and falls off easily, this is not something I wanted.Very happy with my purchase and am glad I got myself this great Xmas gift.", "Date": "December 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "A great information tool that is light weight and extremely mobile", "Author": "djrolandg", "ReviewID": "R37M46U7TN21KB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are looking mobility?

After trying to decide between the Galaxy Tab 10.1 and iPad 2, I pulled the trigger on the iPad 2 (16GB, Wi-Fi, Black) and have yet to regret my decision.Pros:*Apps - The best feature about the iPad is the App Store, and this was the deciding factor for me. On a smartphone, there's a bit more to consider than apps (call quality, carrier, camera quality-in my opinion, pointless on a tablet-,etc.), but on a tablet, it's all about the functionality delivered through tablet-optimized apps.*Design - The iPad 2 is very thin, light, and has a nice aluminum finish on the back. The only comparably sized tablet is the Galaxy Tab 10.1.*Screen - The screen is great, especially in terms of quality and contrast. It's a 9.7\" IPS screen with a 1024x768 resolution.*Battery life - Excellent. It has the best battery life of tablets (Galaxy Tab 10.1 comes close). To get an idea, it lasts for days with some gaming/web browsing each day.*Accessories - Because the iPad is basically the epitome/name-brand of tablets at the moment, if there's a tablet accessory, it's compatible with the iPad.*Resale value - If I decide to sell it later to upgrade to the inevitable iPad 3, I know it will maintain most of its value.Cons:*Cameras - Although I will probably never use them, the cameras on the iPad 2 are horrible.*Screen - Competitor tablets have a bigger 10.1\" screen, but my biggest complaint is the lower resolution of the iPad (1024x768 vs 1280x800). The resolution difference is more important because it would've allowed for more content to be displayed which is espeically important for web browsing.*Apple's proprietary ports - The non-standard ports lead to some overpriced adapters and accessories.*Apple's \"walled garden\" aka iTunes - To most people this isn't a big deal, but some people will be annoyed about having to use iTunes. Personally, I don't mind iTunes, but I hate only having Apple-approved apps available in the App Store.

The iPad's various styli, with their resistant, rubbery \"nubs,\" still leave much to be desired).  Yet, overall there would appear to be few if any viable alternatives at this stage.  Apple was first to the parade and, according to practically every review of the latest model (including that most popular consumer's magazine), continues to remain in the top position.The primary advantage of the Apple 2--from my perspective--would appear to be the lighter weight and more compact size.  Personally, I found the iPad 1 to be hot and heavy compared to my Air 11\", which I now use for practically all of my computing.  So be sure to take note of screen size and overall weight of any other device you may be considering before ordering.  Also, note that the highest-rated tablet on Amazon (the Toshiba) has yet to be released!  If you're considering it, it would seem overly hasty if not reckless not to wait for it to \"test out\" on the market for a few months.As for the iPad, the Flash controversy proved a non-issue for my wife and me.  The lack of certain ports--for HDMI, USB, display, etc.--was never anything that couldn't be addressed and fixed with a readily available adapter.  Finally, look for any other machine that comes close to the iPad in terms of the galaxy of available \"apps.\"  The lack of a keyboard (true of most any tablet) can also be addressed--but now we're getting close to a Macbook Air, which strikes me as the more practical purchase in the first place.In short, there's every reason to spring for another iPad (if you like the concept in the first place) and a number of reasons to withhold purchase of any other brand.  But a caveat: this is one of the few times that I've found a product sold through Amazon to be significantly higher in cost, even without sales tax, than the same product purchased through Apple Store.[As a musician, I've found a reason to like this device: it can be loaded up with musical scores (several life-times' worth) and set on a stand or piano ledger, the equivalent of a giant-sized cabinet full of notated music contained within a thin, easily readable and navigable tablet.]", "Date": "June 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Admit it, it's better than the first!", "Author": "SnapperL", "ReviewID": "R148KR855V83ZY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I will admit that the cameras on the iPad 2 are not the greatest but the naysayers have to admit that the iPad 2 is so much faster and thinner than the first generation (to me, that makes it a great update).

This Ipad 2 is very easy to use and can be used for almost anything. Whether you are at home and just want to play games or watch Netflix or if you are at school and want to take notes, this Ipad can do just about anything. Many people have consumed and reported their personal experiences and for the most part if you own an Ipad 2 you cooler than everyone else who doesn\u2019t own one. People will look at you at work or in class and envy you since they don\u2019t have one. That is a fact! I encourage everyone to own one of these. It is a purchase I do not regret and I would recommend it to anyone. My whole family owns one from my sister to my cousins and nephews and we are all satisfied with the Ipad 2. It works as a mini computer on the go and you will love it. This item is fun to use and is very appealing. The size and weight of it allows you to be able to take anywhere with you. It is much thinner and it has been created to be much faster than other tablets. You will not have to wait for 10 minutes to allow it to turn on , you will be guaranteed fast service from this apple product. There are also multiple languages from which you can choose from to The display of the Ipad is just phenomenal. It\u2019s glossy widescreen allows you to see everything very nicely. There\u2019s no doubt the resolution quality is the best! You would want to take pictures and videos everywhere you go. This Ipad has also been created with front and rear cameras so you don\u2019t have to only take pictures of others but you can take pictures of yourself. How awesome! So if you and your friend want to take a picture but there is no one around that can do you the favor, there is no need to worry about it because you have this ipad. Adjust the camera to face you and snap away. You can also fix the picture by adding filters or purchasing apps that allow you to fix a picture in anyway whether its adjusting the color and brightness or adding funny stickers or borders. There are thousands of apps you can find that are fun and very useful. Many apps you must pay for but they are usually very cheap and definitely worth it. There are also many free apps that are your usual apps. The app store has thousands of apps specifically for ipads. This allows you to have an enjoyable time when using your ipad. When purchasing your ipad, your item comes with free built in apps. These apps include the camera, calendar, clock, safari and many more general apps you need on a everyday basis. Surfing the web on your Ipad can not get any easier. It was created so that everyone can easily learn from your 4 year old sister to your 70 year old grandmother. The buttons on the exterior of the ipad include the home, volume, and silence key and the hold button. The power and battery life of the ipad is excellent. You can go hours of surfing the web or playing games without having to keep charging it everyday.  For example, I recently went on a trip to San Francisco which took 6 hours. I watched movies on the way there and movies on the way back and didnt have to chrage it during my vacation. It was amazing to be able to use it for so long and not have to keep charging it on my trip. On my trip I was also able to factime my brother who was back at home. With the ipad you can videochat and factime anyone at anytime as long as you have wifi. This allows you to have contact with someone you havent seen for a while. It allows you to be able to see someone while talking to them at the same time. This for me is the best part of the ipad since It clearly allows me to see my brother who lives far away from me. The Apple Ipad 2 is an excellent product overall. If you are still debating whether or not to purchase an Ipad 2 you should go and play with one hands on first before purchasing. You can go to best buy or an Apple store to witness this marvelous item in action.I give the Ipad 2 five stars because I love it.

I don't know about others but I know my company switched their entire website to one with HTML 5- good bye Flash. I'm guessing that's going to happen more and more. It has no USB or video out ports?? Ok....then don't buy it! It's amusing how people \"purchase\" the iPad and then moan and complain that it has no USB port or HDMI out ports. Really? You mean....you didn't know that when you bought it?  Seriously, some of the naysayers for this product that say \"it sucks\" and so on are clueless. This is a FANTASTIC product! Ok....so it IS a little pricey, I'll given them that. But then, so is the Galaxy Tab. Most products of this type that cost much less simply are not worth it. Maybe the Kindle Fire will be? Who knows?

Plus right now they are engraving it for free. iPad 2 - 16 for 499.00, w/ 3G 629.00. You can even go to Walmart and get it for that price. I also thought that ALL iPads had to be sold at the same price - I could be wrong here, because I heard that through a friend. I don't know how long of a wait shipping is here, but as of this writing, my delivery date would be July 22-24.So, if you don't mind the wait and you want the best deal for your iPad 2, Apple is the best bet. Or play it by ear and hope Walmart has one in stock and get it the same day.PS. My 5 stars rates the actual iPad itself. It's a great tool and I absolutely love it. Goes anywhere and the fact I can FaceTime with friends across state/ country is totally Star Trek, (I mean, this man totally knew what was coming. In the 60's, can you imagine.)I originally bought the 32GB with wi-fi only. Figured since you are not bound by a contract, (ie. 2 years to subscribe) I would get the 3G just in case I ever wanted that feature. You cannot upgrade. If I were to go on a trip, I could subscribe to 3G for a month and then cancel. THAT is AWESOME.", "Date": "July 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Tablet But Not Perfect", "Author": "David L. Williams", "ReviewID": "R340UD6CAFHE49", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love my Ipad2. It is fast, very reliable and stable, and just plain fun.  But there are a few things that keep it from being perfect.  First, as other reviewers have commented, the camera is the pits and really not up to Apple's ususal outstanding quality.  The second issue, in my opinion, is the slick aluminum back side material.  It looks pretty but really necessitates a case because it is slippery and without a means to get a better grip, it is only a matter of time before the inevitable fall.  I found the same problem with my Iphone.  It would be a much better devise if Apple used a rubberized type material on the back.  I spent alot of time comparing the Ipad2 with the Motorola Xoom at Best Buy before making my purchase, and I really don't think you could go wrong with either tablet.  The Xoom has a far better camera and does flash which might be a big plus if you are really into video and gaming. But flash also comes at a cost in performance and stability which is exactly why Apple doesn't use it.  The Ipad2 seems more intuitive to me and just seems to work better and do things quicker. But I have to admit that my familiarity with Iphone may partly influence my opinion on that point. Ipad also has many more apps available at the moment. One other drawback though,in my opinion, is the need to tether the Ipad to Itunes. I understand their logic, but I really wish it had a simpler PC-Ipad interface. Honestly if I didn't already have an Iphone I might have been inclined to buy the Xoom, but that's not taking anything away from the Ipad2 - it is a great tablet!", "Date": "July 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "For those of you on the fence ... (gamers especially)", "Author": "H. Wang \"nycmode\"", "ReviewID": "R1FCQ0XY5I8VMT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "By now there are plenty of reviews that offer the pros and cons of the iPad 2 versus other tablets on the market.  With that in mind, I've decided to focus this particular review only for those of you who are in the same boat as me - which is debating whether or not to upgrade to an iPad 2 from the first gen iPad.After giving it much thought, I recently took the plunge and I am 100% sure that I made the right decision.  However, this is only in the context of how I use the tablet, which is primarily for gaming and other graphic intensive apps.  Previously I owned the AT&T; 3G iPad with 32GB of memory.  After giving it much thought, I decided to purchase the wi-fi only 64GB iPad 2, since I realized I don't actually used the 3G much.Most of the apps I use are very graphic intensive.  EA games such as Dead Space, FIFA 11 ... or Gameloft games such as Order & Chaos, Starfront, and Dungeon Hunter ... I play those games often and noticed a HUGE difference after I transferred my data to the iPad 2.  The games run much better, and there is a major change in terms of performance.  There is much less slowdown, and FIFA 11 actually plays like the way it should - fast and crisp (and not slow and turgid, like it was when I was playing the exact same game on the first gen iPad).  In cases like this - having the faster processor and added RAM makes a huge difference.Now if you're the kind of person who plays simpler, less graphic intensive games like Angry Birds, Diner Dash or World of Goo, you will probably not notice anything different.  You also won't really notice any difference if you stream or purchase videos as the display is the same as before.  Sorry, but no retina display this time around.But what you will be pleased with is the fact the iPad 2 is far lighter than it's predecessor.  This is important for those of you who spend a lot on the iPad playing games (like me).  It was no secret that the previous iPad was bulky and difficult to hold.  It also made it very tiring to grab the device for an extended period of time (making it difficult to play intense FPS or sports game without frequent rest periods).  The iPad 2's weight makes it much easier to hold and less burdensome to play games for a long time.  Long story short, my hands don't feel numb as often as I did when I used the old iPad.As for the other bells and whistles such as the camera/face time, etc ... all of that is well and good.  The interface is easy to figure out, so there isn't much brain surgery involved.  The smart cover is also a nice touch, though it's not a necessity.  I personally have one though, and I like it very much.So the biggest question here is - should you upgrade to iPad 2 if you already own one?  If you are a die hard gamer, the answer is 100% absolutely yes.  The difference in performance is absolutely striking and you will see the benefits of upgrading within seconds (so long as you play games that take advantage of the upgrade - i.e. games w/high production value).Even the apps I run outside of games run noticeably smoother and faster.  Using video/graphic intensive apps like CNN or ESPN XL is a snap, and they run much faster than on my previous iPad.In short, should you upgrade from the iPad to the iPad 2?1. If you play hardcore, graphic-intensive games - YES, upgrade ASAP2. If you run a lot of apps at the same time, like to use video/graphic intensive apps - YES, upgrade3. If you run apps that aren't that taxing (lighthearted games like Angry Birds, simple interface apps), or use the ipad to mostly surf, write email, etc - NO, upgrading is not necessary unless you have cash to spare (save your $$ for the iPad after the iPad 2 IMO).That's my 2 cents for folks on the fence.  Good luck!", "Date": "July 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "I love my iPad!", "Author": "AF Pilot", "ReviewID": "R2UALA0EPWHKHD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have the 64GB with AT&T; 3G.  I absolutely love my iPad.  It does everything and i've been impressed with it in the 2 months that i've owned it so far.  I use it primarily as my internet browser, an e-reader, and to stream Netflix.  It's a revolutionary  product for me.  The iPad has replaced my laptop as my go-to for internet.  I no longer take my laptop with me on business trips.  The iPad does everything I need.  It doesn't replace the need for a computer, but it does allow me to travel without my laptop and to leave the laptop in the office (or the kitchen where it usually lives) when I want internet access on the couch.Here are some of the key features that I use:The web browser is the real deal.  It's full internet and not a mobile browser.  I like surfing the web on my iPad better than on my computer because the touch screen and gestures are very intuitive.Facetime and Skype look great and are easy to use with the dual cameras.  It's nice to be on the road and be able to see my daughter any time I have an internet connection (Facetime requires WiFi, but you can Skype on the 3G).As an e-reader, I haven't used it to read a full book yet, but I do often use iBooks to crunch PDF files that I use for work.  It allows you to search and bookmark.  The bookmarks then transfer to your iPhone via MobileMe.  It's nice because I have literally thousands of pages of regulations and tech orders at my fingertips in a very portable format.  The backlight screen is nice when reading in a dark environment and I've found it comfortable to use when reading for 15-20 minuets.  I haven't read any longer than that, so I don't know if it will cause eye fatigue over a longer period.Video looks great.  64GB is plenty of space.  I'm currently carrying 17 movies, about 11 GBs of music, 10 GBs of Apps, all of my books and I still have about 20 free GBs to load anything else.  I could probably have gotten away with the 32 GB model.Netflix streaming is awesome!  They have a great selection and the app looks really good.Games on the iPad are really fun.  I have a few board games and you can sit across from someone and use the iPad as your Monopoly board.  The large display makes it a pretty social device.The news apps look really good and have the feel of reading a magazine.Pros - It does everything.  It looks good, is very light and the battery performance is fantastic.  Apple's claim of 10 hrs of use is true.  The battery really lasts a long time.  The 3G service is a good deal.  I don't always use it, so you can set the 3G up to \"pay as you go\".  If you need to use the 3G, you can enter your credit card info right into the iPad and sign up for a month of service.  It's $15 for 250 MB and $25 for 2GB.  You can cancel without a penalty and there's no long term commitment.Cons - Price.  The iPad is expensive, and you could buy a laptop for the same price (or cheaper).  It's a great device and I think it's worth it, but the price is pretty steep.  Lack of Flash support, which is common to all iOS devices.Overall, I really love my iPad, I use it for everything and I take it with me routinely.", "Date": "June 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Get one of these", "Author": "Michael Schultz \"avid9er\"", "ReviewID": "R3R2CFGSWMG71T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been wanting one of these since they came out.

Realistically, this is wonderful for people who do a lot of internet based surfing and want a phone experience but bigger. It is also great for family that is horrible with tech.

I can use it almost continuously for approximately twenty hours before I need to reuse it. Less if I'm using heavy graphics, etc. But even then it functions for around sixteen hours. It charges very quickly when turned off and plugged into the wall. The screen is very responsive, and the keyboard is not as difficult to use as I had feared (this is referring to the larger keyboard that appears when you turn the device side-ways. The smaller keyboard is more difficult, but not impossible). The only downside I see to the keyboard is that I can't select Spanish letters and accents.

That was the right choice for me. I use it all over the place with free wi fi spots so widely available. There are so many apps available that you can customize it for your needs very easily. This almost replaces my laptop computer. I hardly ever turn on the laptop anymore. The iPad runs faster than my laptop on most things online. I bought my iPad after falling in love with the one that I was issued for use in my special education class. I have been totally amazed at the things that I have seen happening in my classroom with the iPad. Any teacher, homeschoolers, or parent should have at least one iPad strictly for the kids. They are great learning tools with so many educational apps available--most free or low cost. And if you have a special needs child or student, then you doubly need an iPad for their use. It is much easier to use than a conventional computer for special needs children. And if you have a child with any disability on the Autism spectrum than you absolutely, without a doubt MUST have an iPad for your child. There are hundreds of apps designed just for people with Autism. If for no other reason than to use as an augmented communication system device, you must get this for your child with Autism.If I am asked to name one flaw with the iPad, it is that it cannot be cleaned. The screen gets lots of finger prints and gunk on it--especially with children using it. And it will get scratches on the screen, no matter how careful you are. If using it in a classroom with lots of children it can be a germ breeding ground since you cannot wipe it down with disinfectant.

Like most people, I use the iPad 90% of the time on just a few Apps. For me, reading an ebook, checking stock quotes, and reading the news constitute most of what I do. It's good to have half a million Apps, but it's impossible to use that many, or even a fraction of that. I've compared the iPad to the Kindle for reading ebooks. For me, the iPad is the clear winner. In my opinion, the iPad is easier to read and is sharper, also the color is a plus. The Kindle is hard to read in low light. Maybe if you are outside, the Kindle would have the edge, but I never read outside, and I think most people don't (possibly some do at the beach). I have an iPad 1 with WiFi and 3G, and an iPad 2 with WiFi only. I think the WiFi is the way to go because of the cost savings. Sometimes the 3G is nice, but I don't use it that often. Bottom line, I can recommend either model.

With all other tablets, I noticed that the tablet would not react to the touch every once in a while.2. The tablet is for my wife. iOS is much more intuitive than Android when it comes to tablets. the complexity of use of Android is fine for techies, though.3. Assurance of OS upgrade. I know that my iPad 2 would be compatible with future versions of iOS and that Apple would allow free upgrades. At the time of my purchase, I wasn't so sure about Android based tablets (looking at how many Android based cellphones dont get timely OS upgrades)4. Flaws in other tablets. Every other tablet has flaws, which is pretty disappointing. Xoom is good, but they dont deliver what they promise (Read up on Xoom users' agony over the micro SD unusability for over 6 months). Sony tablet doesn't come with 3G.Reasons why I took so long before buying the iPad:1. Dependence on iTunes2. No SD input3.

I'm actually writing this review with it right now! A lot of people I know have criticized the iPad for being like the iPhone or iPod Touch, and I have to say while a lot of features are similar to my 3GS (don't own a touch), there are a lot of features which differ. I have had so much fun typing the screen of the iPad, I spent hours with the yahoo app talking to one of my friends while I installed my other apps. I am a college student and plan to use the iPad instead of my computer at school so I don't kill my back walking to class. I'm not the most tech savvy, but I know my way around the iPad from having my 3GS and love the simplicity of the device.  Besides, you can't beat the awesome of having almost full functionality of web pages through safari on the iPad. I continually get frustrated with my phone's version. I am not a fully converted Apple person since I still own a Sony Vaio and prefer the solidarity of The Sims 3 on PC. I also used a Mac last semester in school, and I just couldn't get used to it.I also REALLY love how much faster the iPad 2 is compared to the 3GS. It may not be a fair comparison but I also added 6 gigs if ram to my laptop so I could have a faster machine. I hate lag.Oh! Not having adobe flash hasn't fazed me one bit. I don't really understand the argument about that one but the iPad has no trouble playing YouTube videos in safaris browser. It doesn't take you to the YouTube app like on the iPhone. I almost bought the Sony tablet which was recently released but I didn't feel like getting all my apps all over again since  I already own popular ones like angry birds. iTunes on the iPad has similar functionality to the program on the pc, and I'm assuming Mac, and I out most of the songs from my husbands accout in here. I also have never used a honey comb based tablet so iOS and iPad I went. iOS 5 installed in under 30 minutes for me.I have accidentally hit the back button in here twice with the iPad-the screen is extremely sensitive-and I don't think I can leave anything more useful for others considering the iPad, so I'll wrap it up. I got the 32 gig iPad in black and I've had a hard time putting it down. I'm also using a reflex series Otterbox and never plan on removing it from the iPad.

My girlfriend just got me one for our anniversary. Funny thing is she just got one from her mom for Christmas at my suggestion. So now we both have one.She just recently got wifi at work, too. She takes hers to work. She tends to call me about 3-4 times a day (at least it feels like that) and now she can call me on her iPad using Facetime, so she can see me as well. I don't really know how I feel about that feature sometimes, but it's pretty cool. I have other friends with iPads and iPhones and stuff, so we can all Facetime just like a house phone. It takes a little more effort to use it (just like Skype), but it's a really cool native app to the iPad. The camera quality is a bit to be desired. I think my Mac has a better camera than the iPad.Anyway, I'm not giving a review of Facetime. The iPad 2 is fast. The screen is pretty large compared to my iPod touch and my Droid X. It works well as a reader. The games work well on it. I've even used it as a drawing tablet a few times. I would link a photo I've drawn in my review, but I'm not sure I can do that.The browser works just as well as it does on my Mac and my iPod touch. It's not the best thing in the world, but it works well.Mail is still a problem for me. I can't get my Yahoo to work and I can't actually divulge why. I know the reason why and I'm not willing to fix it because it could be a slight security risk. Gmail works fine for me. I can't get my work e-mail to work either, but I haven't messed with it enough to really determine the reason just yet.The iPads are great to have around to watch Netflix and things like that. Especially when there is a toddler that wants to watch something and everyone else is watching something on the big screen.Finally, the iPads are very expensive. So far my experience with Apple in the past few years is that they build a quality product and it tends to be worth it. I hope they continue this trend.

Here it is. The IPAD 2 that came to the house via UPS was in a little box. Who knew that something so powerful would come in a non-descript brown box. I was tracking the travels and travails of my IPAD through the supplied tracker (I am grateful for this feature) and was literally waiting for the UPS guy to show, times are either 10:00AM or 3:00PM missed the ten AM. Guess what..... Was waiting at the front door at 3; UPS showed up and so did my IPAD. Opened the box up, stiffened my resolve to not mess around until the IPAD was fully charged. So hooked the IPAD up, and waited for a full 24 hours. AFTER that, configured the machine to the wireless internet and then commenced to download EVERYTHING. The IPAD is COOL. It goes EVERYWHERE and can do practically everything. And the really weird part about this whole thing is this....my daughter, who is 4, put a claim on MY IPAD?????? Uhhh...NO. The answer is GET YOUR OWN. Too funny; For real, we share. But she did put a claim on the IPAD. All right, 5 stars, the seller gets a thumbs up as well for making sure that the delivery parcel was NON-DESCRIPT and no other verbiage was on the box either to state what was in inside either - once again the seller get a thumbs on that.

They provide you a very portable second screen. I happened to pick the iPad 2 after a lot of research with other tablets.I am away from home a lot during the day for work and class and also at night as I study. As a college student and future programmer I love having the iPad as a second screen. I can have my Kindle and PDF textbooks, web tutorials or HTML help apps open on the iPad as I type notes and program on my laptop. I am not constantly having to minimize or switch between windows on my laptop screen, which is pretty nice. I can also have Netflix, the ABC app or Hulu playing as I do homework. The small size of the iPad allows for me to slip it right into the same case as my laptop, awesome! They have some laptops now that have a pull out second screen but it seems to be an expensive option that leaves no other features like the iPad (or another tablet) does.iPads also have a lot of other fun features besides providing you with more screen real-estate when you aren't doing homework or programming!The End*I am a fan of Apple, have been since the early 90's when in 1st grade I was blown away by the amazing Oregon Trail (yes I know it was MECC software) on the IIGS in all it's green glory. I now own many Apple products. I am also a fan of Microsoft, work on Win XP and 7 at work everyday and have no issues with Windows. I also play pretty hard on the Xbox 360 in my down time.

(reiview may still need revising)", "Author": "moon fox", "ReviewID": "R3LM338BSH5SJN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "You are there, standing in the middle of the electronics department, credit card in hand, about to spend hundreds of dollars on a touch pad you can trust to be worth the money, and a good product. The store clerks are saying different things to you about each pad, and you don't know who to trust. Ladies and Gentlemen, the I Pad 2 is the correct item for you! It consists of app selection, optional WiFi, and other sources such as 4g. Coasting around the range of $800.00, I would suggest this particular system over any of the other available touch pads. I tried another once. I didn't like it. I would choose ipad2 over a regular i pad. why? many reasons..It is faster.it looks better based on the fact that it is so thin..Its the newest version, so why not take a go before it gets outdated?The following are my views on this remarkable contraption. Also, I'm just going to call the I pad 2 an i pad just to make it easier. Just know that the I pad and I pad 2 are 2 different products. Sometimes, i will call it an i pad 2, but just so no one gets confused while reading this, there's a fact. Hope they help!First facts: This was a bummer, but based on Apple restrictions, the i pad 2 does not have flash, so it can't play online games or run certain programs that need flash. There is also no place for discs or flash drives, so you can't download saved work such as the data on flash drives or discs. You can't download programs like Microsoft office programs on this particular item, which is not fortunate, not to mention the fact that it doesn't connect to the printer. Hopefully some day it will evolve into better stats.Camera: For the most part i like the camera, but based on the fact i haven't seen or interacted with many other i pads except my own, which has a crooked, bury camera, it wasn't the best for me, but the other touch pad i owned had a horrible camera. I don't know how the other cameras look on the i pad 2 because i don't bother to put pictures of myself out into the public on the store tester i pads, so, keep the camera idea something to check on before buying. On the camera though you can make it look straigt ahead like a regular video camera or make it face the way you are looking at the screen, so it flips around depending on what kind of picture you want. I give MY experience on the camera a B gradeApp selection: Great apps! Many apps are free, but 1 app's full version wasn't free on the i pad like it was on my other pad. I still don't think that should be a problem. Also the apps appear with fewer selections on the screen based on certain categories then my other touch pad, which appeared in a long list that was helpful. Although i would beleive that all together the ipad 2 has a wider selection of apps. Unlike some touch pads, The i pad 2 offers netflix, and many other apps that are one of the reasons i got the i pad in the first place. Great quality. I give the apps a A grade.Battery: The battery doesn't last very long. Sometimes, it last a long time, but for the most part, I always have it charging. This is a issue if i want to travel with it. I'm going to have to get a i pad car charger... Anyway, the battery issue may just be with only MY i pad 2 but I'm not really sure. I would give this category a C or B grade, but it has some work to do before it reaches an A.App download speed: The apps for the most part download quickly, but there has been some times where the apps don't make any progress with loading so i usually have to delete it (and pray it will actually download) and download it again. In the end i always get ti worked out but its like, \"Come ON!\" you know? I give this category a A for it's amazing speed!WiFi quality: I love this category. Mine plays most H.D. videos and can just download apps from its app store rather then having to connect it to the computer to download things. That i can really appreciate. I can open up nearly all web-sights just the way they would appear on the internet unlike my last touch pad. I would say in order to get the full i pad 2 experience WiFi is a must-have. I give WiFi a A for great function!Speakers: Lets put it this way, the speakers... they could use some work. Sometimes when i have it to the maximum sound it is hard to hear. That is not something that i favor based on the fact that the i pad is like, 40% sound, but i still like the product. If you have this problem i suggest going to a quieter area or plugging in ear phones to assure you get the most out of your money.Covers: I don't have a smart-cover. Perhaps the smart-covers do save the battery and make the screen sleep when you put the cover over it, but i have a cover that's not a smart-cover and it is just fine. As long as you turn it off when not in use for long periods of time any covers should work. Note that the cover should fit nicely around the i pad 2, that way, it is a better buy and protects the i pad more. i would suggest a case to help protect it and make a nice little stand for it. You can't exactly rate a cover because there are many different ones, but here is my rate on how important a cover is to have to me. A B. Its optional, but a good idea.App Usage speed: Most of the apps i use are great, fast, functional, and don't have jerky movements. Take Talking Friends apps for example. They are fun, functional, and fast. Just how it should be, not to mention very clever. There isn't much to say about this particular category, but let me just say it deserves a A or B for nice function.Note where there should have been another Category view: I haven't had really any interaction with a regular i pad, so i can't say if the i pad 2 is really \"new and improved\", but i can say its good for me and very fast. Keep that in mind.Video and Photo booth: I love making videos, so i was happy to hear that the i pad 2 came with a camera ready to make some videos! It is a personal highlight. Also photo booth is fun. seeing what your pictures look like in x-ray vision, and flipped, and so much more. I really liked that. too bad you can't film videos in photo booth :( Also note that both of these are the free apps that come right when you get the i pad. the video is connected to camera app.Personal Favorites: I love the i pad 2, but my favorite features about it, are the following:.Its very thin and simple, which is very neat..The apps are great and so are their function..A i pad without WiFi is a very sad i pad..Videos and photo booth..speed!-------> ZOOMGRAND CLOSING..These are all my opinions of different category in the i pad 2. Comment if there is more you want to know about the i pad 2 and i will see if i have an answer to add to this review for you. Thanks for reading!

Yet, the iOS doesn't do well here. In result, reading PDFs is impossible as it causes some serious strain on my eyes. I have 20\" LCD HP crap that has ~3 less pixel density. Yet, the font edges are as good as on this IPAD. Huh.I see IPAD3 fixes this problem, but not in the iOS but with better screen - good for marketing since not many people even see any difference. In fact, people say the screen is not worth it. Huh. Makes me think if I got the eagle eyes or maybe there is a few million people who simply don't know nothing.If you don't need PDF, well, letters in Safari are terrible too.Also, I cannot believe there is no LED behind the Home button. There is even that dark square in it where LED could fit (like on HP touchpad). So, carrying it next to me, like iPhone, and checking email frequently is the way to go? That's ridiculous. If I am not using it, it's on the stand, not withing my reach. That's where LED comes handy.Also, when I click on Mail icon that shows new email, it opens inbox, instead the email. - few clicks more are needed to see the email. Terrible approach if you plan to use multiple accounts and receive many emails.Finally, Notification bar is not popping-up new messages when I am working on ipad. Why? Status bar is there all the time - showing some small icon when new message arrives would be completely unobtrusive.In summary, message/email communication interface is years behind Android.

This review is my total honest opinion on the Apple iPad 2. I have no connection to Apple and this is my honest experience with the item. Advertisements and commercials for products are always circulating twenty four-seven. This also applied to the iPad 2. I had not paid much attention to the advertisements as I was satisfied with my iPad though at the moment, and had no need for the device.One day while at home, my iPad fell out of my hands and was destroyed. I thought maybe to buy a new iPad but then the idea off an iPad 2 came to mind. The iPad 2 was released on March of 2011. I had seen so many commercials and heard so much about it. So the next day I got my little piggy bank, emptied it out and had about $28. Yeah, there was not too much money in my little piggy.I got the rest of the money from my parents, and the next day went to the closest Best Buy and bought a 16GB iPad 2 black tablet for the price of $499.99.  I also bought the 1 year accidental protection plan for $99.99, knowing my clumsy hands and bad luck. So I had spent around $600.00 on a single item. So this Apple iPad 2 I had gotten was supposed to be near perfect on the amount of money I had spent on it and way better then my iPad. Now the Apple iPad 2 was 7.3 x 9.5 x 0.3 inches in dimensions. The iPad 2 was really thin and really comfortable to hold.It was also lighter then the iPad, not by too much but still a bit lighter. Now that I told you a little bit about the physical characteristics, let me tell you the new features that make this item unique. Apple doubled the RAM in iPad 2 from around 256MB to 512 MB. This will help process graphics for games and help deliver images faster. The two cameras is also a better feature over the old iPad, one in the front facing you and one in the back. Now these cameras aren't anything special. Their digital effect is just alright and the pictures will not come out too crisp or clear. The cameras do help with video chatting and FaceTime.One of the biggest disappointments I had with my iPad was that it was never available to multi task. The iPad 2 increased RAM allows more applications to be open at once. Now these applications are available in the app store. There are close to 70,000 iPad specific Apps that work on the iPad 2. There are also Google Books, iBook, Nook, Kindle for readers on the iPad 2. I can use all these apps all day long because of the battery life.The iPad 2 battery last over 10 hours constantly on. The need to recharge battery constantly is not necessary. Now as great as the iPad 2 is with all these qualities, every coin has two sides, this applies to iPad 2. There are several things still needing improvement on the iPad 2. There is no USB support for mass storage. There is also still no dedicated SD card slot. For example, if I wanted to put pictures onto the iPad from my camera, I would need an adapter.Another distinguishing flaw in the iPad 2 is the lack of flash support. There are many programs that require the iPad 2 to run on Adobe Flash. The Android tablet on the other hand does allow Flash support. The iPad 2 is a great and impressive tablet that can be purchased in the market today. The iPad 2 is probably the best on the market at the moment. The iPad 2 isn't perfect and the price may be a bit high but if you can afford it, I would recommend it for you.", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "I pad", "Author": "Willie L.

But think about WHY you want an iPad-2 or similar device, then compare the convenience and utlility of owning the devices, and Apple's iPad is very hard to beat.The big negative is the high price.  Another is no full hardware-level interface for UBS, SD, or Flash/Shockwave/Adobe support -- I can't figure out why not. You can hook several devices into the iPad-2, but in most cases (especially for cameras, SD cards, etc.) you'll need to have at least one physical media adapter.  Apple has maintained that Adobe Flash, Showckwave, et.al are obsolete, so they have no plans to support any of it.  Time will tell if Apple is correct (if not, then expect another adapter in a year or so).The positives outweigh the negatives however.The size and weight make the iPad-2 extremely easy to carry around, and convenient to use. For now, this IS a major advantage, but 'Moore's Law' about the rate of electronics miniaturization is still 'in effect', so the iPad-2's weight and dimension advantage will be gone within 2 years. By 2013, it's a good bet that all devices will be at elast as light and thin as the iPad-2, and they'll all do 'more stuff, faster' for about the same (or maybe less) money.The iPad-2's camera-system, with 'face-to-face' conferencing potential is more of a theoretical advantage than a real one: it only works well if you and the people with whom you're conferenceing have similar device capability (2 way video) and reliable broad-bandwidth availability. Otherwise, the experience and results are less than thrilling.The iPAD2 RAM memory is double that of the iPAD (512MB), which means faster performance of many graphic-intensive apps, and better responsiveness for users who like to 'multi-task' with several apps running at once.The Application software availaible fo the iPad-2 far exceeds that which is available for most competing devices, both in terms of quantity and quality. This is probably the main reason to get an iPad 2 -- you can just do more stuff (useful, recreationsl, fun, or other) with an iPAD-2, because more people have developed and marketed apps for the iPad/Apple platform than has been the case for anything else.  Given the overall state of flux for mobile computing, with platform and operating systems shifting, APPL (with a relatively stable operating platform and system) may be able to maintain its advantage in applications for some time.Worth killing people to own?  Don't mess with Apple: if you go into their stores, be sure you have enough money to get out alive.  In the mean time, April 2011 seems to be a good month in which to sell AAPL common stock.

I own Apple products (luckily I didn't have to buy them all my job did) and I've been sorely disappointed with every one. Apple products have not Flash support, no Java support, and no support for almost any video formats that are not Apple proprietary.If you want a mobile pad that plays almost any video I would suggest the Asus Eee pad both support flash, and both support Java, so that means online streaming sites work, and online flash games work.

This means that after 13 months (unless you pay for an extra year of warranty then it will be 25 months) you could be flushing $500-$800 down the toilette. Even worse, if you are still under a warranty then Apple will give you a refurbished Ipad which could have 2-3 year old parts in it. An Applette at an Apple store told me that any broken Ipads are sent back to the factory where the unbroken parts are recycled into other Ipads. In other words, if you have a 6 month old Ipad that breaks, you could get a replacement that is already 2 years old. These disposal electronics only have a 3-5 year lifespan and `refurbished' has a reputation of lasting 1 month past the end of the warranty period or 6 months, whichever is a shorter period.

This aluminum body tablet is 9.7 inches weighing 1.3 pounds making it one of the lightest tablets on the market today, also having an A5 dual chip processor and a 720p retina screen display. It comes in three sizes, 16,32 and 64 depending on your downloading and previous photos, videos and music you can choose which one will better suit you. This tablet is a must buy if you're a traveler or you want a cool gadget to play games, listen to music, take photos and view all your social networks. Not to mention its great battery life when your on the go except for when your watching movies. The layout on the device is very structured so if you're a user that has an android phone then you probably wont like the feel that the iPad gives out. If you're an apple fanatic like myself who has all apple products then this will be another great add on to the collection.  Working at BestBuy you have the exciting job to know all the truth behind products as well as being able to get them a little early, nevertheless I must say that this was worth the buy. For the average man it will cost you 500 dollars, 543.11 to be exact when you pay NYS tax but like I said it's worth the buy. Launching the iPad was a great idea, with this device you can take notes and organize your daily tasks and if you just want a device to use to play thousands of games (many which are free) then this is a great buy. Personally carrying a MacBook pro to school each and everyday puts a toll on your back, so the iPad is a easier way to have a device which can do most of the things your computer can do, it is called an accessory to a MacBook  Personally this has to be one of greatest products out there I remember when I first bought it and synced it using iCloud to my other apple devices.

This aluminum body tablet is 9.7 inches weighing 1.3 pounds making it one of the lightest tablets on the market today, also having an A5 dual chip processor and a 720p retina screen display. It comes in three sizes, 16,32 and 64 depending on your downloading and previous photos, videos and music you can choose which one will better suit you. This tablet is a must buy if you're a traveler or you want a cool gadget to play games, listen to music, take photos and view all your social networks. Not to mention its great battery life when your on the go except for when your watching movies. The layout on the device is very structured so if you're a user that has an android phone then you probably wont like the feel that the iPad gives out. If you're an apple fanatic like myself who has all apple products then this will be another great add on to the collection.  Working at BestBuy you have the exciting job to know all the truth behind products as well as being able to get them a little early, nevertheless I must say that this was worth the buy. For the average man it will cost you 500 dollars, 543.11 to be exact when you pay NYS tax but like I said it's worth the buy. Launching the iPad was a great idea, with this device you can take notes and organize your daily tasks and if you just want a device to use to play thousands of games (many which are free) then this is a great buy. Personally carrying a MacBook pro to school each and everyday puts a toll on your back, so the iPad is a easier way to have a device which can do most of the things your computer can do, it is called an accessory to a MacBook  Personally this has to be one of greatest products out there I remember when I first bought it and synced it using iCloud to my other apple devices.

Tablets are toys. Apple tries to lock you in.", "Author": "Igor J. Gorkeulhzenht", "ReviewID": "RTBU0JS59VSB5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Tablets are toys. Last year, I dropped cable and considered either buying a Mac Mini or iPad 2 w/ Apple TV 2 and hooking it up to my TV. I decided to go with the latter. Not the best move. If you want to buy content from Apple, it may work well for you. If not, you have to jump through hoops or put up with inferior quality. Netflix and Hulu are not as good on the iPad or Apple TV as they are on a computer.In fact, I should have stayed away from the Apple line in my HTPC decision... It would have been smarter to get a nice, Sony laptop and one of the WiDi boxes that allow you to screen share your PC with your TV. (I hate the idea of plugging a computer into HDMI with a cable). Then, when you play music from your laptop to your TV (connected to a stereo), you can trip out on the visualizer. Apple TV 2 has no visualizer. It has no horsepower. It is the iPhone 4 processor packed into a hockey puck with some output jacks slapped on. (from a design perspective, it is well done. I do think Apple are still great with hardware).Tablets are toys. For example, if you want to surf the web on the iPad, there is no Flash. Indeed, people make a much bigger deal about this than it is, as most big websites offer the same content as h.264 video. However, you will run into a few that only use Flash. You can use Photon, but it is not that great. It is true that Flash on mobile devices, even Android, is not very good. See? Tablets are toys!The really bad thing is that Safari does not support the file upload html input element, so you cannot upload photos to sites like Ebay or Facebook. You need to use their apps. Why? Because iOS does not let you get into the directory structure. It is a toy. A consumer product. It is not cheap either.Like I said, I should have just got a nice Windows 7 laptop and WiDi, which would have been better than a Mac Mini and a remote keyboard. The laptop can go anywhere and can be used without the TV. Why not get a Macbook and Apple TV 2 and use AirPlay? Because it does not support screen mirroring! I think there are third party solutions, like AirPlay Server (not made by Apple). But we know why they do this. If it doesn't fit into the Apple ecosystem, they don't want to put in much effort to support it. After all, if they did that, you might watch Hulu instead of paying for shows on iTunes. I shudder to think that Apple is rumored to be interested in aquiring Netflix and Hulu. If they do, say goodbye to affordable programming...Oh, and if you want to buy a show or movie on Amazon and watch it on your TV with the Apple ecosystem, good luck. It is nit really possible with the iPad 2 or Apple TV 2, and if you do it on the Mac, you either need to plug into your TV, or maybe try the third party AirPlay screen sharing software, if it still exists or is any good...The Intel WiDi system, with devices made by a few manufacturers, had 1080p for years before the new Apple TV 2 did. If you project Hulu or Netflix, full screen, onto your TV, it is 16:9 widescreen, etc. It is simlly a better HTPC setup than I can think of! Total buyers remorse. I will have to put up with this iCrap for a few years, until it is totally obsolete...My Apple fanboy days are over. Everything I own is Apple, and I see more and more bugs and more creepy \"lock you in\" behavior every day. Look, I am not going to pay $4 to rent a movie or $1-4 to buy TV episodes. Even though I watch maybe an hour or so of video programming a day, I would end up spending $100+. I may as well have cable.With the new Apple iBooks scandal, we can all see the writing on the wall. I also see Apple products, even the Mac, becoming less computers and more consumer toys. I bought my first Mac because I am a developer and needed a POSIX environment. Many times I wish I just got a decent Windows laptop and dual booted Ubuntu and Windows 7.Apple quality has gone downhill bigtime recently. The new updates to Apple TV have it crashing quite often.To make a long story short, if you want to buy content from Apple, an iPad may be fine. But if you want Netflix, Hulu and Amazon, you should look elsewhere. What? The iPad has Netflix and Hulu and Apple TV has Netflix built in? Yes. But they are not as good as the computer versions. To watch Hulu on your TV, you have to do a convoluted process, to get it to work somewhat well:1. Close all the apps on your iPad2. Shut down your iPad3. Restart Apple TV4. Start your iPad5. Turn on screen sharing6. Start HuluThe closing apps and restarting the iPad was recommended to me by Hulu support, but restarting the Apple TV 2 seems to help a lot too. See? This is worse than Windows! Remember when Apple products didn't need to be rebooted comstantly to work?That will get you Hulu on your TV, but it is  4:3 with content cut off. The video is jerky and (appearantly due to legal reasons) they can only have a 15 second buffer size, unlike the Flash based version.I will say that the iPad 2 with Apple TV 2 can do some amazing things. A game like Metalstorm, played via AirPlay mirroring has a cool feature, where the iPad becomes a virtual cockpit (it is the game controller) and the game is on the screen. Indeed, an iPad with its gyroscope and acclerometer is a great gaming controller and gaming device.That said, if you like stuff like World of Warcraft, you are better off with a Windows laptop. iOS is a great gaming platform, but I think Windows still has an edge for deeper games.I am not a gamer. This was meant to replace cable TV, and does not do the best job. I was warned. I read a review in some tech mag that said the same thing... But I figured between Netflix, Hulu and the AirPlay feature, I had all my bases covered. Yes, but it is not a quality experience. It is often tears before bedtime.If you want a consumer gadget toy kind of thing, the iPad is fine. Probably better than any other tablet out there. But I now think tablets are a fad. The press claims they are the future. People tend to settle for less, if told it is hot stuff. Look at Twitter, or the fact that most of us listen to music that has lesser audio quality than a CD (which doesn't sound as good as vinyl!). Heck, I settled for 720p for this setup. I could have spent the same amount of money, got a quality laptop (like a Sony, forgetabout Dell and HP), and a WiDi box, and had a way better experience... Along with having a real computer that I could use independent of my TV -- something with a real web browser, real applications... I gotta say, even Safari on a Mac is pretty bad. The app looks nice, but web pages are often poorly formatted and there is a bug that prevents me from using my bank's website!See what I mean? Apple used to be the one that had quality. I think they have become arrogant and are resting on their laurels. Additionally, the influx of lame consumers combined with \"democratic design\" has them spending more time on Twitter integration than develping a decent mobile browser that can do something as basic as upload a file! Forget about Flash! These things can't even upload files! How can they? You have NO ACCESS to the file system. Even then, they could let you access the photo roll, but they were too busy setting up iCloud so they could gouge you, and putting in system wide Twitter integration for the iSheep idiots.I used to get annoyed when the Phandroids and Apple haters called these iToys and the users iSheep. But there is a lot of truth to that.I bought my iPad 2 about 10 months ago, and I have buyer's remorse. I had way too much faith in Apple. Keep in mind, they want you to buy their content. They are not going to bend over backwards to create a decent Hulu or Netflix experience. Who knows? Maybe these are purposefully hobbled so you will get fed up and just buy the show from iTunes.But iTunes is not great. I have a decent internet connection, and it takes 2 hours to download a 1 hour show. They do not stream. In my opinion, Apple is a terrible internet company. For example, you can't even watch the video, on Apple's website, about the new iPad on the iPad 2. I have tried to backup my iPad 2 for a month now, but their iCloud stuff is so dead slow, it fails after a few hours, and the progress bar says it will take 10 hours to back up -- just the basic backup!DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE! The iPad is the best tablet, but tablets are HYPED! You would be so much better off just getting a nice, small, quality laptop. Given the better integration of Windows 7 and WiDi for getting your stuff on the HDTV, I would even say, forget about getting a MacBook and Apple TV 2. Forget about a Mac Mini and a cumbersome remote keyboard. I have the worst Apple hangover right now! It just hit me how limited a lot of their stuff is... Their nice ecosystem can be done better, and with more options and choices. I'd rather play music from a Windows 7 laptop to my TV/stereo through a WiDi box, and get the visualizer and all that jazz...I used to really love Apple products, but they have lost their luster. I don't think products like the iPad 2, the new iPad, and Apple TV2 meet the needs of even most consumers. The fact that the Mac is slowly becoming a big iPad makes me wish I had opted for a Windows/Ubuntu system.Did I mention that after the iOS 5.1 release and the new Apple TV 2 update, AirPlay has crashed on me about 8 times. It probably would have crashed more, but I often just listen to the radio instead now. Pathetic, eh? Yep, Windows ain't lookin' so bad now!Apple is becoming way too oriented to the average consumer. If you cut the cord (ditch cable) and go with Apple, you will pay as much, if not more for content, especially if you have a family. Don't buy an iPad 2 and an Apple TV 2 and expect Netflix and Hulu to work very well. This is no slam on either of those companies -- I think they rock! The best Netflix snd Hulu experiences are computer based (I have not tried Roku, Boxee, etc.)You should not have to pay $4-5 to rent a movie, or $2-3 to buy a TV show. WTF? I don't want to watch that same episode of The Office more than once.Just like this iBooks scandal, it is clear that Apple is here to suck you dry.

I, like a lot of other sheep, went out and quickly spent about $650 on this thing. Then I was told by Apple,for an additional $150 I could get two years worth of technical support which I gladly gave up. What they did not tell me was that I would have to be on a complete LEARNING CURVE( which they did not even understand themselves!) to use this product. First, let me say, don't waste your money on any Apple technical support gimmicks. I had some valuable notes stored on my Ipad 2 to do a convention with about three days before this happened. I went to Apple technical support because my e-mail did not work on my Ipad 2.Then they instructed me on how to delete my notes and \"wake up my e-mail\". I said, \"won't I lose all my notes?\" She said \"No, one has nothing to do with the other\". My response was \"Are you sure? I really need these notes for my speaking engagement at the convention\". She said \"No way you'll lose anything. Trust me\". What she should have said is: \"I'm an Apple tech support person, who gets paid by the hour, and it's no skin off my nose if you lose your notes or not!\". And that's exactly what happened. As per her instruction....I lost all of them. I was devastated. I had to spend days,scrambling to recovering at lease some of my lost notes. I will never get back what I lost...ever. I didn't know that everything on an Ipad 2 had had to be backed up to a REAL COMPUTER(notice I said: REAL COMPUTER). I was never told this. Now, that there have been so many failures and complaints about this product I understand they've created a thing called \"cloud\", which does the same thing....backs up your files. You will do better to buy a smaller version of a laptop and don't fall for the nonsense,like I did, that this is a great buy.....because it's not.Wondering if my e-mail was ever fixed? After spending six hours on the phone with Apple and completely losing my notes and going through the process to \"restart\" my e-mail 6 times..... guess what? It still doesn't work!!!

I wonder at how something so weak could be so popular.

When the IBM PC became available I bought one and discovered what a well-executed operating system was like. I used Microsoft DOS for 8 years before changing to Windows 3.1 which was slowly developed into the present Windows 7 version.It looks like Apple is repeating the same cycle with the IPAD2. The system is so restrictive it limits any chance of even limited productivity. If you're only interested in playing games, email or rather poor quality photo images and video then you'll probably like the Ipad2. I will admit it's very stylish which is probably a big help with sales but you can't tell a book by its cover.

The head supervisor there confirmed that the policy and design of Apple is such that itleaves no options with the customer, but to re-buy another piece even if the touch screen is cracked.In my case, the screen got cracked due to keeping the iPad under my pillow after my night time reading. They requested me to send the picutures of the cracksand said that the cracks are due to external pressure and hence do not come under warranty, leaving me with no other option but to not use the Apple iPadanymore due to safety reasons. I am left only with this option because I dont want to buy another same product in its replacement. I can as well buy similarproduct from other company's offering.I even offered to give back the product and give me atleast some money. But they said that Apple doesn't have repurchase policy in India.In addition, the other known Apple issues like unable to play videos ( due to non compatibility of flash player), low sound, no external ports provided likeHDMI, USB etc. The maintenance is also a rip-off. Please note that you will have to buy seperate Apple accessories if you desire to have ports to connectwith other non-Apple devices. Even the sound is low to inspire customer to buy external speakers.The intersting thing is that other similar products inmarket have these things built in.Having burnt my hands after buying my first \"Apple\" product, I have decided not to buy any future Apple products and highly recommend not to waste so much of anybody's hard earned money to buy such a product.

I received the IPad 2 as a gift from my daughters.  When I first opened the IPad2, it was WOW.  Now that I have used it for 2 weeks, here is my opinion.  It SUCKS.  No offense to the IPad lovers.  Here are the reasons:The IPad2 lists at $499 with a puny 16GB memory.  After you load a few apps, your memory is down to say 14 GB.  There is not much you can hold with only 14GB...music, videos, pictures nowadays eat up a ton of memory.  If you want a higher memory, you have to buy the 32 or 64GB, at $599, and $699 respectively.  And even so, the last time I had a 64GB storage capacity is when I had my Atari Computer back in the 80's (ok..i'm exaggerating..but you get the point).  Apple calls 64GB a progress?  And some people hail Steven Jobs as the great innovator?  This is going backwards in time.The IPad storage capacity is NOT UPGRADABLE.  You have to sell the old one and buy a new one.  This is how Steve Jobs made a lot of money, off of a lot of unsuspecting customers.  What puzzles me is why do some continue to patronize such marketing program.There are a few things you can do to overcome the small storage, such as, carry a bunch of SD cards, preload it with files and use the camera kit to view.  Some suggest using an external harddrive which you again have to preload with the files you intend to use.  Others suggest using online data storage which you have to pay, somewhere between $10-30/month, and mind you, you have to be online to access these files...so if you do not have WIFI or 3G access, you are SOL.If I have to do the above to gain storage, what have I gained from IPad2?  I thought the IPad2 is about ease of portability?  Not to mention the additional money one has to spend on the additional accessories.The 3G data capability adds $129 to the IPad2.  Bear in mind, you still have to subscribe to the 3G data.  If you are on the go, the 3G would be helpful.  However, the 3G is not all dependable depending on where you're at.  The 3G signals in China, Hongkong, and Macau were unreliable.  In mainland China, I was able to get \"some\" 3G data, but none is HongKong and Macau, even when there were strong signals....something to do with prioritization...they give their local subscribers priority, and you get the scrap signal (This is according to T-Mobile).  Maybe this only happens in China.IPad has NO ethernet cable connection.  While it appears that more and more places are now going WIFI, there are still a lot of good hotels using ethernet cables.  Sometimes you have to go to the lobby (a great inconvenience) to get your best WIFI signal (so, being able to use the ethernet cable in the room would be more convenient).  And there are still a few hotels that don't offer WIFI.  Then what?  You are SOL, unless you bring your own WIFI router.  So I ask again, if I have to bring a router for these rare occasions, am I not defeating the purpose of the ease of portability?The IPad2 was not able to open a video clip from my Canon T2i (format is .mov).  Later I hear Ipad only supports apple video formats.  It does not run Flash based content.  It does not run Java.  What the?I still thank my daughters for gifting me the IPad2.

It's such a big difference. The Ipad2 doesn't show on and off it shows green for on with no words. I didn't order it for my self and I told the person who I purchased it for he said it's ok. I called customer service all I got was smart remarks. I was told \"we have other sellers so we don't know about the products that are being sold\". So I asked how you sell something on your site that you don't know about?  Her response was do you want a refund?  Never Again with Amazon! I just feel everyone should know be aware of your purchases with Amazon because you might not get what you asked for or you think you payed for!", "Date": "May 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Epic Fail", "Author": "Frostwind", "ReviewID": "RLGZCEBSCRRPM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Horrible, glossy screen kills my eyes.

I'm not going to treat the iPad as some sort of godlike creation, I am going to give the most straight review I can: the iPad isn't that great.Heres the things I will go into detail about: First of all,its got graphic capabilities that are about halfway to Playstation PSP and Nintendo DS, so its game's are pretty,but they aren't anything to get excited about.Next up, its App market is great. But the problem with it...well, I'll get to that.The hardware itself.. that's where i got a bone to pick.It slipped out of my hands one day and it hit my tile floor,and the screen cracked. And the same thing happened to my friend: but his was in a protective case. These things are fragile, which makes me wonder why anyone would trust these things to a kid under 5.Speaking of fragile,ive dropped the ipad on -carpet- before and the video output on the screen turned green and well.. broken. If you want to see this for yourself: Google \"iPad Green screen problem\".Finally, I bet you are wondering: What about those apps I bought? My ipad still sounds usuable,so I still use them,right?Well, yes,and no. The thing is when I dropped my iPad,I was -moving- it. I still use all my apps,but the only good ones i got from it were universal: So when I say i'm using them,I mean on my iPhone.So,to bring it all back home: Its just an overpriced piece of technology that you probably will stop using after 6 months, give or take how much you have to pour into it to find uses for it.", "Date": "August 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Ipad 2 refurbished doesn't work well- Sold by Warehouse Deals, Inc", "Author": "Unsatisfied", "ReviewID": "R3KQ2RVUZ6PHYM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My order was an Ipad 2 refurbished, big mistake!!

It arrived on time and intact. However, there were no instructions for use. After communication with the vendor, we learned it is necessary to \"activate\" the ipad by plugging it in to an internet-connected computer with subsequent connection to itunes. However, even after \"activation\" there are still no instructions as to how to set basic things up such as email. My husband ended up taking it in to his tech people to set up basic needs, and this has taken a large amount of time and work (and still is not complete over a month later with multiple people involved).This is disappointing since the unit cost over $1,000. Surely, basic setup instructions should be included for an item of this value!!!Perhaps buying an ipad from this vendor might be good for those of you already highly knowledgeable in how to set an ipad up. For the rest of you, do even consider buying here. Go to an Apple store or to another source that offers basic installation instructions and help. My iphone works great, but I bought it from an Apple store where all my questions were answered up front. I wish I had bought this ipad from the same store.Bottom line: the hardware coming from this vendor is probably fine.

I had such high hopes for this little device. Then was astonished at how it didn't even come close to my medium-low expectations.Here it goes:  The auto rotate is slow and suddenly will rotate when tilted randomly. When you don't have the wall plug-in it will not recharge while plugged into a laptop. The touch pad is either so sensitive or will NOT work At ALL after many attempts. Apple says it has a 10hr battery life - try five hours at best. A data package must be bought to use the Wi-Fi when the advertisement says it can be used right out of the package. You have to buy iTunes comparable packages to use the iPad. Free Apps are NOT all free - there is usually a fee to make them work to the point they are enjoyable. Don't even try to upload ANY of your own music or movies. Apple is sooo proprietary that if you didn't buy the music or movies through iTunes you can't use it on the iPad. And when you try to access the Internet, better-off using your Mac/PC. Moreover, accessing Wikipedia or nearly any other sites that uses videos to enhance the info, entertainment, music you can only watch around 70% of the content. Sure, the Flash is not available for iPad but it should be able to play the other videos. On Aug 5th, I called Mac customer service and the rep even said he could not believe Apple sent out the iPad 2 without some kind of plug-in or app to make the iPad more user friendly with the Internet. Oh, one more, DO NOT set the iPad face down or it will slip off nearly any surface you think is flat. The front surface is so slippery.I don't have the time to list and all negative experiences have been experienced only owning it for three months. However, I must say, the screen is bright and clear. The iPad is light and sturdy. The apps that do work, work VERY well. The processor is extremely FAST! It is not a horrible product. It just needs to mature a little.I have been using Apple/Mac and PC products for more than three decades and could not speak higher of the quality and ease of use of Apple/Mac until now. I'll probably be buying a different brand like a HP Slate 500, LG G-Slate, Viewsonic ViewPad 7, RIM BlackBerry PlayBook - to name a few next time unless I pad 4 is more compatible with reality. Please, for the love of all good things, heed my advice and DO NOT BUY THIS! (At least not yet.) Nearly ANY other pad/tablet at two thirds the price will do much more than the iPad 2.* NOTE * DO NOT BUY THE iPad magnetic Smart Cover. It easily slips off and WILL traumatically send your iPad to an early demise.No, I would not recommend this to a family member or friend at this time.
