The one I have doesn't even have a name how about that.The box only says android and there's nothing on the tablet itself.Battery life that i get is 21/2 hours so far.They need to do better with the battery and the charger..They seem to misrepresent their product.Charger looks and feel cheap.I know it was a low cost for this tablet,but still could have had a better charger.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Price, Great Tablet!", "Author": "Michael Keller", "ReviewID": "R3CJ5ZXDELPO7F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this tablet for my granddaughter. Wanted a larger screen to watch netflix on.  Had a couple 7 inch tablets I had bought before but this tablet out performed them.  It has a faster processor (ran very smooth) and great screen resolution, with 8 gig of memoryI had plenty of room to download games for her.  It was delivered early and right out of the package started up with battery charge. I have encountered no problems or glitches. The only bad thing I could report was I wish the speakers were a little louder but I bought a tablet stand with speaker enhancement now can hear netflix great. 5 stars worked out so well I'm buying 3 more for my other grandchildren for Christmas.
