{"Reviews": [{"Title": "For me, Thrive beats Galaxy Tab and Acer Iconia", "Author": "Kaio", "ReviewID": "R1RG0JE05ECJWC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "*UPDATE 8* Now Up:  See the addendum at the end of this review.I pre-ordered the 32gb Thrive here on Amazon, but got impatient and went to a local retailer just to check them out. We loved this tab so much, we got a 2nd for my husband in 16gb.Toshiba BrandFirst off -- No -- I do not work for Toshiba. But I fell in love with the brand a little over a year ago when I bought a new Qosmio laptop, and it's BY FAR the best computer I have ever owned.  I love it as much today as the day I got it, so when I found out Toshiba had an Android Tab, I had to take a serious look.Galaxy & Iconia in BriefPrior to learning about Thrive, I was seriously considering the new 10\" Galaxy Tab.  I had been coveting the 8\" model for some time, but just wasn't ready to take the leap.  So when the 10\" came along, I just had to stop by a local retailer to try one out hands-on.  And I must say, I really fell in love with it -- the screen is vivid and stunning, the interface is clean and responsive.  And it's super thin for sure.  But, the first thing I noticed was there's no inputs of any kind; no SD slot, no USB, no nada.  The sales rep said that's because everything is trending toward the \"cloud.\"  Well, that's all well and good, but I like products that I control, not products that control me (hence why I'm no fan of Apple's line of iShackle products.  I'm all for \"the cloud\" and have one here on Amazon for my music, but I'm also the type that prefers to have my own stuff stored locally.  I also like to get into the nuts and bolts of my peripherals and use them my way, so having no inputs on the Galaxy was a huge letdown for me.  I left the store feeling underwhelmed, and like it wasn't the right time to buy a tablet.  But I was bitten by the bug so I went home and started researching other tabs.Reviews here on Amazon had me convinced Acer Iconia was better than Asus Transformer.  And the Acer had USB inputs, so I was happy with that.  But I've never been a big fan of Acer, so I still wasn't feeling the itch just yet.  But then I stumbled upon the Toshiba Thrive, and still being so highly impressed with their laptop, I immediately felt a connection to the Thrive.Every Input I'll Ever NeedThrive has SD card, USB, mini-USB and full size HDMI ports.  And for me, this is where Thrive clobbers the competition -- Toshiba just \"gets it;\" they make products that keep the end user in control and offer a truly freeing experience.  I have a full size HDMI port on my Toshiba laptop too, and let me tell you, it completely changed my computing experience!  My laptop is connected to a 50\" plasma TV and I use a wireless keyboard and gyration remote for a mouse.  Let me tell you, once you use a computer that way, there's just no going back.  So all those inputs on the Thrive was a big clincher for me -- and once again, Toshiba stands head and shoulders above the rest in this department.  I fully expect to connect my tablet to my HDTV as well.  And the on-board SD and USB ports assure I'll have all the computing freedom and control I've come to expect.Vibrant Screen and ColorWhen I first saw the Thrive at my local electronics store, I was a bit concerned the screen wasn't as vibrant as the Galaxy.  But then I remembered Thrive has an auto brightness feature, so I was wondering if that was limiting the saturation in some way.  I was easily able to find and navigate the setup menus right there in the store, turned off auto-brightness -- and voila! -- the Thrive's screen was every bit as vibrant and rich as the Galaxy!  The colors and clarity are nothing short of stunning.  I hate to say it, but the screen is probably better than my 50\" plasma (it's only a couple years old, which already makes it a relic in tech world.)Ease of UseFor me, the truest test of any piece of tech, is the ability to use it straight out of the box with NO help from user manuals.  I got a new printer recently and had to fiddle with it for days because the install didn't set it up properly -- and in my book -- that's a sure sign of a piece of junk.  This Thrive, however, was very simple and easy to get the hang of within minutes right there in the store.  Naturally, that's as much a testament to Android 3.1 as it is to Toshiba Thrive.  Either way, I was doing everything from surfing the net, to customizing the entire interface and settings in minutes, all right there in the store -- no user manuals, no nothing.  I even tethered it to my cell phone just for fun.  The interface is so smooth and responsive, and the Tegra CPU is clearly a beast; no hangs, locking or delays of any kind.  Everything was fast, smooth and clean; just the way it should be.  In fact, Thrive loaded and buffered YouTube videos better than the Galaxy, though there could be many reasons for that given all the devices on the store's WiFi network.Rubberized BackSome might not think much of this, but believe me, it's pretty awesome and makes the Thrive feel like velvet in my hands!  It also gives me confidence in the tablet's durability and build quality.  By contrast, both the Galaxy and Iconia have a hard, slick back, and as a result, I personally found them both harder to hang on to.  I'm disabled and easily drop things, so I never felt fully confident holding either the Galaxy or Iconia.  All of these tabs are just a few weeks old, and it's worth pointing out that the backs of both the Galaxy and Iconia were scuffed and scratched to the point of making them look junky.  Granted, they're both display models in a high traffic store, but the physical condition of both these tabs after only a couple weeks on display suggests one can expect the same blemishes from personal use over time.  By contrast, the Thrive's rubber backing assures there'll be no scuffs or scratches on my tab or anything I set it down on.  And if it does wear out, I can just buy a new backing in one of 6 cool colors.ThicknessYes, the Thrive is probably twice as thick as the Galaxy, but I'm ok with that.  Especially since it isn't all that much heavier.  I think the added thickness is due to the USB and HDMI inputs the Galaxy is lacking.  Personally, I'd rather have a slightly thicker tab with all the inputs I want, than a wafer thin tab that has a USB dongle dangling from it that I always have to remember to carry.  Smaller and thinner isn't always better, at least not for my taste.  I don't want a 10\" wafer thin screen that I'm scared to drop or set down anywhere, or that will easily get scratched or cracked.  The Galaxy just doesn't feel very durable, nor did the Iconia.  While the added thickness and rubberized back make the Thrive feel more durable; like it could survive being accidentally dropped, or if placed on a table, the rubber backing would help it survive minor spills.  Being disabled, I need something durable, and to that end, the Thrive feels like it will easily outlast both the Galaxy and Iconia.  And we're not talking a super thick tablet here; it's still plenty thin.  It's also very light; if not, my hands would cramp up and I wouldn't be able to grasp it to begin with.Wider Body - More To Get My Paws On!The Thrive is a bit wider than both the Galaxy and the Iconia -- the screen size is the same on all 3, but the Thrive's casing is about half an inch wider, which is great because it gives me a little more edge to hang on to without my fingers covering part of the screen.  I have big hands, so this all adds up to a good thing for me.  Overall, the Thrive just feels better in my hands, and more sturdy and durable.Screen ProtectorsI'm a fan of those \"helicopter blade\" screen protectors and have been using them on all my touch screen devices for years.  I went ahead and ordered a full body protector for my 32gb Thrive pre-order.  But after getting my hands on my husband's 16gb Thrive, I'm realizing I don't want to cover the velvety rubber back of my Thrive with a screen protector.  They haven't arrived yet, but I'm hoping we can use the back of the screen protector on the front of our 16gb Thrive (both pieces appear to be the same shape and size.  If not, no biggie, we'll just order another screen protector.  I'm a big believer in screen protection and they've saved me from accidental scratches more than once.Entertainment HubI've read that Tablets are trying to edge themselves into being the conduit that connects all your devices -- TV, cell phone, computer, etc.  And after getting this Thrive in my hands, I can see how tablets can easily fill that void.  I love my Qosmio laptop, but prefer not to take it away from home.  And my smartphone is great, but the screen is just too small to enjoy surfing the net on it.  But now with the Thrive, I can stay connected and still enjoy a full-fledged experience on the go, or even at home, all in the palm of my hands.  I've never been much into social networking, but I'm realizing that for someone with limited mobility, this might be my conduit to the outside world.  I can totally see how using this tab in a social aspect while watching TV would broaden and enhance my experience.  I just may get into Twitter too, and all that thanks to this Thrive!  Duh -- I'm starting to get why they named it that to begin with!Replaceable BatterySome people might find this meaningless.  But I just had to replace the battery in my expensive Harmony remote and it's only 2 years old.  So for me, having a replaceable battery in an expensive tablet its HUGE!  No other brand offers this but Thrive.Bottom Line -- my head is reeling a bit from the thought of owning 2 tablets.  It's really not an expense we can afford and I should probably cancel my 32gb pre-order here at Amazon or return this 16gb.  But we love it so much...  I guess we'll see what happens.  Either way, I really love this tablet and am VERY happy with it.  Every once in a while, a product comes along that fits my life like a glove.  Last time, it was Toshiba's Qosmio laptop.  This time, it's their Thrive tablet.  These are the first 2 Toshiba products I've owned, and I must say, I think Toshiba has won me over for life.  The quality, ease of use, superior construction and forward thinking innovation -- I'm sold; hands down.  There are plenty of tablets out there to choose from.  Just do your research and find the one that fits you.  For me, that's Toshiba Thrive.  I LOVE this tablet!!7/22/11 UPDATE -- Tips & Tricks:After using both 16gb and 32gb Thrive's for a couple weeks, I thought I'd add this addendum to my review:HDMI DUAL VIEWHook up the Thrive to your HDTV and the screen will display simultaneously on Thrive and your TV; Angry Birds on a 50\" plasma - FUN!  I got a 25' HDMI cable, but am looking into wireless.  Picture is stunning.  BTW -- there's a reason why HDTVs _don't_ use mini or micro HDMI -- because the signal isn't as good as full-size HDMI, and only Thrive has that capability.DON'T USE A USB HUBI've had spotty results transferring files to Thrive when plugged into a hub.  But when I plug the Thrive directly into my laptop's USB port, I've had no issues and transfers are quite fast. (Win 7 Pro 64bit)FIREWALLS CAN BLOCK APPSI was initially having problems downloading apps from the Market while on my home WiFi, but then I realized my router's firewall was blocking some of Thrive's inbound traffic. So I set up 2 simple Port Forwarding rules, and voila, problem solved.BATTERY LIFEThrive charges in a about 1 hour; slightly longer if you're using it while charging.  So far, I've been getting 14-26 hours per charge while using Thrive on and off throughout the day.  My screen is set to 50% brightness with auto-brightness turned off.  I leave WiFi on and just let Thrive go into sleep mode when not in use; naturally, the battery lasts even longer if I completely shut down at night.  Yesterday, I started the day with 50% battery life left -- I played Angry Birds for 4 hrs straight, watched YouTube for an hour, surfed the net and checked email for another hour, and read a book for 90min -- all that before the battery finally died and needed a recharge.  There's nothing scientific about my tally, but Thrive is giving me great battery life, IMO.ADOBE FLASH, FAST SURFING & PAGE LOADSSurfing the net is NOTHING like on my phone.  Web pages load as fast as my laptop and I can have several tabs open at the same time.  Fast, smooth and responsive.  Flash works great.  Haven't run into a website yet that doesn't work.EXTERNAL USB & FLASH DRIVESMake sure they are formatted with FAT (not NTFS) and you'll have no problems.  I even hooked up an external 500gb Western Digital My Passport drive with no issues.WHY 32gb IS BETTER THAN 16 or 8gbThrive comes pre-loaded with many apps; some useful, like Toshiba File Manager and Service Station; some not so useful, and they can't be deleted.  Point being -- I've never heard anyone complain about having too much HD space.  So do yourself a favor and get the largest GB you can afford.  SD cards, IMO, are for convenience, NOT for extending your storage capacity and running apps off it.  I use mine to view and transfer pics off my digital camera.FUN & HELPFUL APPS>Advanced WiFi Lock Free -- this solves the dreaded wake from sleep issue.  Go into the app's settings and UN-check \"Enable Timeout.\"  Prior to this, I experienced the issue twice, but since installing this app, the wake from sleep issue has disappeared.  I do sometimes have to push the power button twice to get it to wake from sleep.  But other than that, I don't have any complaints about how the buttons work.>Talking Panda Free -- fun for kids of all ages!>Amazon Kindle -- read your digital books on Thrive.  Just wish it had text-to-speech.>DirecTV -- program your DVR(s) on the go and never miss a fave TV program.>Angry Birds -- I never thought I'd get into this game, but it really is fun.  Rio is my favorite edition.>Paint Joy -- finger painting on your tablet.  Save, share and even watch a time-lapsed rendition of your creations; kinda fun!  Let loose your inner artist!THRIVE PORTFOLIO CASEI got this case for outings away from home.  But at home, I prefer using Thrive without the case.  The Thrive is thicker than Galaxy, but I probably would have left Galaxy in it's case, because I didn't like how slick it felt.  So Thrive without a case is about the same thickness as with Galaxy with a case.ENTERTAINMENT CENTERThrive has already become another component of my home entertainment system.  I use it simultaneously while watching TV or even surfing the net on my laptop, which is hooked up to my 50\" plasma.  The Thrive has become an addition and a natural extension of my home entertainment center.That's it for now; I'll add more in time, if I think of anything.9/5/2011 UPDATE 2 - over 2 months and still loving my Thrive.  Here's a couple extra helpful tips:HDTV VIA THRIVEWe took our Thrive on vacation with us for our anniversary (happy 21st to us!) and hooked it up to the hotel's 42\" HDTV.  Thanks to Thrive's full-sized HDMI port, we easily ran a 25' cable right to our bed and watched our fave TV shows right off the TV network's websites while connected to the hotel's free WiFi.THRIVE DOCKDo yourself a favor and get one if the expense fits your budget. It's a tad overpriced at $50 with no power supply (it uses the one that came with Thrive) but it doubles as a great lap stand and makes charging the Thrive much more convenient; just slip it in and out of the cradle.  Don't like how the adapter fits into the Thrive itself and the dock solves that problem.  Also, Thrive looks great on display in the dock too.  I suppose if you don't mind changing the screen timeout a lot, you could even use it as a digital picture frame (just be careful with that if running off the battery.  I have a review for the Toshiba Thrive Multi-Dock with HDMI too if you're interested.PORT FORWARDINGI was going to post specifics in my last update, but thought it might be different for everyone and didn't want to misinform.  But in case it helps anyone, here's how I fixed the problem I had with downloading apps from the Market on my home WiFi:I have my router's firewall set to high, and when I played around with the different security levels, I noticed the 2 that were blocking my Thrive were Real A/V port 7070 and T120 port 1503. I set 2 specific rules and opened those ports for my Thrive, and then the Market apps downloaded without issue. (these were both inbound traffic.  You have to know a little about port forwarding for this to make sense, but it's not that hard to do; a quick Google search never hurts. :-)MORE GREAT APPS> Scrabble is interesting because you can play online over time. I have 30 games going any given week. The app is a bit buggy, but it's still fun and I'm sure they'll improve on it.> Documents To Go is half off @ $7.99 in the Amazon AppStore> Twitter - works well but I'm still learning and don't tweet much, mostly follow.> Gmail comes standard with the tab. GDocs and all of Google's stuff is awesome.> GOOGLE SKY helped us find Jupiter, Mars, all the planets and stars in our solar system last night!! CQQL!!> The Kroger app lets me add digital coupons to my grocery store club card.> DirecTV Remote controls my TV's DVR; kinda neat.> Weather Bug for Honeycomb has a neat widget where you can flick up or down to change the temperature amongst your saved locations> Cloudy is a fun paper airplane game> PhotoShop Express is free and always good to have.> MXvideo Player has neat swipe controls that make it easy to forward, pause and reverse vids while they are playing.> the Bookmarks widget that comes standard with the tab lets you scroll through thumbnails of each web page.> Vevo and TV.com apps have some good content> Fruit Ninja is surprisingly fun; I like Zen Mode.  It speaks to my inner samurai.> and don't forget my all time fave: Lily The Talking Panda> All of these apps have free versions; the only one I've paid for so far is Paint Joy Pro at $1.99.> & Remember - 1 FREE PAID APP A DAY here on Amazon!That's all for now folks!;oDUPDATE 3 - 9/27/2011Over 3 months and I still L-O-V-E my Thrive!  It's a cornerstone of my entertainment experience. I do take it with me when I venture out, but home is my primary use. It is ALWAYS in my lap. Instant fit in my life and fills a void no other device can.  Perfect!Here's the latest Helpful Tips I'd like to share:Project Your ThriveI recently discovered that Thrive can be hooked up to an Epson Projector, which can be invaluable for those doing business presentations. Just plug in a standard HDMI cable from Thrive to the projector, and it will project your Android tablet onto any surface. Sure, you could do this with another tab, and HDMI dongle, or micro connection, but I never like being caught in the lurch with nonstandard cables. I've been caught more than once with a proprietary cable that's failed. I much prefer the convenience and reliability of Thrive's full size onboard ports. I have a review for the Epson Multimedia Projector on that page as well.Tablets Are Touchy-FeelyFor me, a tablet is a tactile experience, hence, external keyboards and mice are not required.  I've tried them both and found them counterintuitive.  If I want to use those things, I've got a great laptop for that.  A tablet is a device that stands on its own like no other.  It is a personal item, hence, it should feel good to hold.  It's not a cell phone.  It's not a computer.  It doesn't play by the same rules.  Quite simply, it's the most personal and indispensable component of all my tech items and fills a void no other device can.More Fun Apps:> Weather Bug for Honeycomb has changed its name to AccuWeather for Honeycomb. It's still the best weather app I found; the widget is great.> Days Left -- has a neat widget that goes on your desktop and can countdown the days to special events and occasions.> Amazon AppStore has a great app that makes it easy to shop for apps and get their Free App of the Day.> Airport Mania 2 -- has become one of my favorite games. Think Chevron Toy Cars with wings! The object is to land planes at your airport, wash, paint, load & unload packages and passengers, maintain and fuel up all the planes visiting your airport, and safely send them on their way. It's like being an Air Traffic Controller, but fun!> Word Mix -- a unique word scramble game that is addictive. You can play against the clock or Puzzle Mode.> WiFi Finder -- will find free WiFi Hot Spots in a Google Earth-type layout. It finds everything in your vicinity and maps it. Be sure to download the offline database within the app, so you can use it without a WiFi connection.> Rocket Bunnies -- If you read that title without a smile on your face, then you won't have any fun playing this game!> Prize Claw -- why waste money at a stupid machine, when you can play this for free! The teddy bears are cute, too!> Paradise Island -- think Sim City> Flying Penguin -- slide on your tummy, away from the polar bear, before he eats you up!> Fat Booth -- ever wonder what you'd look like chubby?! (or people you know or stars & celebrities)> Guinea Pig Getaway -- yes, it's as adorable as the title. Tilt and move your tablet to help guide their boat and escape the big meanie chasing them.> Foto Tiles Slideshow -- turn your desktop into a collage of personal photos that change on a timer; think digital mosaic, only it's a live desktop, not a screen saver.And last, but not least, I'd like to share a post written by Pie Grrrl, in the discussion section of this review - she had a VERY interesting conversation with some techies over at Best Buy, who gave their candid impressions about Thrive and other tablets. The direct link to her post is below. In brief, here's the just of what she learned:> All of them highly coveted the Thrive; the feel, the look and the full size ports.> All of them are gamers and mostly used their tablets at home; like I said in the review, these fill a void in everyone's home entertainment experience. Personally, I live in a bit of a bubble, and my Thrive has been a natural fit in my life and a conduit to the world. It's indispensable.> 20+ tablets coming out, including a newer, thinner Thrive.  Personally, I'm excited to see what Amazon's got up their sleeve with their upcoming new tab. I'm hoping for a slide-out keyboard, not that I'm in the market or could even afford to buy! I just like drooling over new tech.> Sales are tied between the Xoom and Thrive. The Xoomer's aren't interested in the ports; the Thriver's are.> the guys loved the Android platform vs. Apple's because they loved tinkering with the tablets and rooting them. Personally, rooting is nothing to be afraid of, and gives custom access and features to any Android tablet or phone. Just be aware it voids your warranty. I'll probably be rooting my Thrive once it's a little older.Looks like Amazon removed the link, so if you're interested, just look for Pie Grrrl's post in this review's discussion section: Posted on Sep 27, 2011 3:51:40 PM PDT.And lastly, and this time I mean it, a word about NetFlix -- I've cancelled my account, but some people have found a workaround until the official app is released. Point being, it will work, but just do a Google search, and I'm sure you'll find plenty of info. Having said that, Amazon VOD works perfectly, no tinkering required.BTW -- there's a post in this review's discussion thread, where on September 7, 2011 2:48:15 PM PDT -- where U. Shelat says explains how to get NetFlix working; As I no longer have NetFlix, I cannot verify if this works or not.Okay, I lied, I have to leave you with 1 last suggestion... get the Kindle app and read Jermaine Jackson's book about his brother Michael -- it's riveting. Yes, I have a review there, too. Love reading Kindle books on m Thrive. The book is called You Are Not Alone: Michael, Through a Brother's EyesThat's all for now, folks!Go forth all, and \"Androidify\" your Life!(Believe it or not, I didn't just coin that, it's actually an app):oDUPDATE 4 10-18-2011Had an interesting experience with an iPad today...Ran into someone who was trying to get photos transferred to their iPad -- they fumbled with hooking it up to their laptop, syncing to iTunes, then futzed another 30 minutes unable to make anything happen.  I just smiled.  Told the person how much I genuinely admire Mr. Jobs' genius, but wouldn't it be easier to just have onboard ports like on my Thrive -?- you'd be 30 seconds away from being done.  :oD>MORE GREAT APPS:>Webroot Security - FREE anti-virus, secure web browsing and rogue app scans.  Paid version includes ability to wipe a lost device clean on command.>Thumb Keyboard - Split your tablet's keyboard to the left and right corners of the screen -- makes typing and texting just as fast as a cell phone.>Circle Launcher - A nifty launcher widget that you place on your homescreen. Choose from a circle, a horizontal or a vertical line.>ADA Disabled Service Members - Free Americans With Disabilities Act info for Returning Service Members.Androidify all!:oDUPDATE 5 10-21-11Thrive just got an update adding Google Video support; basically movies on demand for a small fee. Between that, and Amazon VOD playing so well on Honeycomb and the Upcoming Kindle Fire, I'm beginning to think Netflix not working on Android Tabs is no accident. Either way, Netflix's time may well have come and gone, by their own doing as much as anything else.No word on Honeycomb 3.2, though at this point, I'm more interested in Ice Cream Sandwich! (Android 4.0) I saw a video and it looks yummy!  :o)UPDATE 6  10-24-11NETFLIX -- User ID \"Visa Citi\" just posted in the discussion thread for this review that NetFlix is now working. I downloaded the app, but was unable to log in, because I cancelled my NetFlix account several months back. I'm not interested in rejoining, but I checked another forum and confirmed that it is working.Android 3.2 -- is due shortly. And 3 weeks tardy in my humble opinion.Android 4.0 -- is the one we all want; no word on if or when.And it just goes without saying that I have to recommend more apps. Or as I like to call this portion of the review...KAIO'S ESSENTIAL ANDROID APPS:> AllRecipes.com Dinner Spinner -- Great recipe app.> Iris Alpha -- A prototype app that mimics Siri iPhone 4s.> Circle Launcher -- One of my new faves and recent Amazon Free App o' The Day -- Unclutter your desktop with this nifty launcher widget that you place on your homescreen. Choose from a circle, a horizontal or a vertical line. The widget contracts to a small icon that, when touched, expands to display all the icons you've enclosed within it. Can be completely customized to your preferences.Th-th-that's all folks!Enjoy and Androidify!;^DUPDATE 7 - 11/27/2011Skype - is officially working. I don't use it myself but several users have verified it.Android 3.2 - click the Service Station icon to update.  No meaningful cosmetic changes; most likely bug fixes.  No word on when 4.0 will be ready.A word about memory, by Jeffrey Peterman:\"If you look at the memory on the tablet, you'll find it split into 4:1. \"Normal\" internal memory, the same as the base memory on a phone.2. Internal SD memory, which is internal memory allocated for storage.3. External SD memory (an inserted microSD or SD, depending on the model.)4. USB memory.The system dynamically allocated memory between 1&2, without needing any user intervention, and this memory makes up the 8, 16, or 32 GB in the tablet. The other two \"spaces\" (inserted memory cards and USB memory) can ONLY be used for media storage - you can't run any program from an inserted card or a thumb drive, but you can open videos or documents that are on those removable spaces.\"Comment posted: Nov 27/11 3:30pmThanks JeffreyThe question about memory comes up a lot; how much to get?  Do I need 8, 16 or 32gb? To me, it's not a matter of the cost of a 32gb v.s. a 16gb + SDcard.  That comparison isn't equivalent, because having all the internal memory I need is far more valuable to me than an SDcard.  I'm not a fan of splitting critical and personal files that way.  I use my SDcard to float between several devices, but it always comes down to personal preference.Here's how it approximately breaks down:> an 8gb Thrive will have about 2.5gb available> a 16gb Thrive will have about 10gb available &> a 32gb Thrive will have about 25gb available.I've tried to write & update this review so it would answer an array of basic questions that come up often.  This is new technology to everyone, and it's the beginning of an exciting, new frontier.Androidify AllKaio:oDUPDATE 8 -- 3/17/2012Durability:  Well it's been 9 months with our Thrive, and still going strong.  The chrome finish near the camera is showing slight signs of wear.  And the lock on my SD card slot gave out just the other day.  It still reads SD cards, but I guess I'll have to tape them down, so the spring doesn't shoot it across the room.  Other than that, it's physically holding up quite well.Cool Volume Boost App: I found a cool app called Volume+ that boosts the audio up to 20X on the Thrive's speakers, and I even installed it on my new LG Marquee cell phone.  The app boosts the volume nicely on both devices, and can even boost bluetooth headsets and call volume as well.WiFi Tethering:  When I got my new cell phone I had to figure out all over again how to root it and configure the hotspot so I could tether my Thrive to it, but I got it working, and have a tutorial on how I did it posted on my blog.  Just check my Amazon profile for a link to my blog if you're interested, or check my post on March 7th in the Comments of this review for more details on tethering to a cell phone.Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich:  According to Toshiba's Twitter page, the Thrive will be getting this new version of Android by the end of Spring.  FINALLY!Android Green Back Cover:  I got the green back cover for my Thrive awhile back and it looks really cool.New Kid On The Block:  Toshiba Excite came out a couple of weeks back.  It's much thinner than the Thrive, so just decide if you need Thrive's ports and exchangeable battery.  If not, take a look at the Excite; it's currently the thinnest tablet on the market.More than likely this is my final update for the Thrive.  It's been fun seeing just how long this review can get, and how many comments we can all generate!!  Thanks to Everyone for all the fun.Keep Thriving & Androidify!;oDKaio... Still just visiting Earth!", "Date": "July 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "More than pleased", "Author": "Scott W. Hutton", "ReviewID": "R2PGLNUKE0BPJQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first tablet (had it about two weeks), but I work in IT and have configured upwards of 40 iPads for employees to use at my job. I liked the iPads, don't get me wrong, and while configuring them for our employees, I came to see the real benefit of having a tablet. I'm a big fan of the Android OS, so I decided I'd go with an Android tablet since it offers superior customization and streamlining.I went with the Toshiba Thrive and couldn't be happier. It's fast, responsive, and the Honeycomb OS is very, very slick. I can see a lot of potential in the OS and am looking forward to Ice Cream Sandwich (the next update that will integrate phone and tablet operating systems into one) later this year.PROS* Stable - I never experienced the sleep issue at all, but installed the fix yesterday anyway, since it offered some additional performance improvements. No issues out of the performance at all. Everything is fast and responsive. A joy to use.* Responsive - Honeycomb OS is very fast, clean, and customizable. Very intuitive to use (at least for me). Adding widgets, etc. is fun and easy to layout.* Video/graphics - Videos look great in all formats, but really snap in HD. All the graphics look great, and the text in the Kindle App looks amazing. Visually stunning. Everyone that has seen it has been impressed.* Customization - You can set up the five screens any way you want. Widgets are wonderful things! Also plugged it into my laptop and it loaded up without any problems, allowing me to copy some pictures, etc. quickly.* Multi-task management - The third button along the bottom left allows you to easily switch from application to application quickly. It's amazing how quickly you can get to something once you get used to using that button!* Size - to me, this is a pro, because you feel like you're holding something and it's very easy to hold on to. You don't get the sense it's going to slip out of your hands, like you sometimes do with the iPad2. It doesn't feel cheap or cheesy, but very solid.* Battery life - I've read some mixed reviews on this, but I get a good 7-8 hours of serious use out of it before it gets below 20%. Over nights, when sleeping, it uses 2%-4% battery life. And it does charge fast, they aren't kidding about that!CONS* The charger - Not a big deal, true, but it's a small laptop power supply, which I just find annoying to have to lug around. They should have a simple adapter you can use with the provided mini-USB to USB cable.* Sound - Not really a big issue (and I may be missing something), but even with the volume all the way up on the device, it still sounds a little low to me using headphones. Maybe just a preference here, but I thought I should mention it. It does sound much better without the headphones on, though, but can be a little clinky and suffer from reverb on heavier tracks of music.* Storage - not really a \"con\", but more of a heads-up. You won't have the full storage amount available to use. For example, if you buy the 8 GB version, you won't have 8 GB of storage to use. Honeycomb and other things (drivers, etc) take up part of that amount. Same with the 16 and 32 GB versions. Not a big deal, but I know some people are wondering why they only have 5 GB free when they bought the 8 GB version, for example.OVERALLA wonderful tablet, performs great, looks great, and has impressed a couple of co-workers enough that they are going to buy one. The full USB port was the big selling point for both. This tablet has been everything I'd hoped for and more. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a tablet. This is a great first step into the tablet pool by Toshiba, I must say. If you're wondering if this tablet will do what you want, I'm pretty sure it will :)I give the Thrive 5 Stars.NOTES* There were a couple of image/OS updates ready to be installed right out of the box using Toshiba's SERVICE STATION app. I recommend immediately installing those updates before you do anything else. As with any new laptop, PC, phone, or tab, you should update it first before jumping into other apps, etc.* I use ADVANCED TASK MANAGER to kill open apps that don't come with a native procedure for closing them. It integrates into Honeycomb very nicely, and all you need to do is tap the icon along the bottom right of the screen to open it from anywhere. Very slick and easy.* I recommend that after updating the Operating System and Tablet image through the SERVICE STATION app, you set the LOCK SCREEN PIN (founds in SETTINGS >> LOCATION & SECURITY >> LOCK SCREEN). Also fill out the owner information (it will appear on the lock screen with the keypad). You can never be too careful, and if you do lose it, at least when someone tries to activate it, you'll have it PIN protected with your contact info right there for them to see.Thanks for reading.

The Thrive is in my opinion the best tablet available. The things that set it apart from other tablets are: Removable battery, Full size HDMI port, Full size USB 2.0 port as well as a mini USB port. All on board with no dock or adapters necessary. You can take your SD card right out of your camera and plug it in to the Thrive ( Handles up to 128 GB SDXC, what?!!) . Toshiba was smart enough to include a file manager that makes it super easy to move data or media between the tablet and SD card or external hard drive, etc. Running Honeycomb 3.1 right out of the box as well. The wifi is the best I have seen, better than any device in my house and I have a lot. Tethers to my Android phone with no problem. The audio is the best I have heard on a tablet.Toshiba worked with SRS and it shows. (One note, the default volume levels are low. Go into settings and adjust right away) The screen is better than the Xoom but not quite as good as the Samsung (in my opinion) and it seems to do better with higher quality and higher resolution content. Looks phenomenal when viewing pictures from my Canon Digital with an L lens. Color accuracy is excellent,not just oversaturated like some other tablets. The screen response is great. Ran a multitouch test and it recognizes 4 separate touch points simultaneously. 2mp front camera and 5 MP back camera are both very good with good lighting. All in all this tablet offers more interoperabilty than anything on the market. It charges really fast, 90% in 90 minutes. Very, very happy with my decision to go with the Thrive. I had considered the Asus but with the horrific build quality issues and lightbleed I decided against it. I am so glad I waited because Toshiba got it right, right out of the box! This thing is solid! No creaking or flex. No loose bezel. Zero lightbleed. A tablet is the sum of all its parts and in the words of Charlie Sheen, #Winning!Update: 14 hrs today on the battery with fairly heavy surfing and some music and video. The battery gave me 6-7 hrs the first few charges. Wow, I didn't think it would improve this much!

First let me say this tablet is not perfect but I am am very pleased. It is like having a large smart phone. I love my smart phone! My husband was able to get most of his apps installed, but some of mine are not available for the tablet yet. I am able to use my cloud service and access several of my paid apps (spreadsheets, word docs, etc). The widgets & apps that are missing from the market are not an issue because I can access these items online (banking, personal finance site). I am optimistic that the android community will remedy this eventually. I am a techie and I love it.The interface is flawless & smooth, saved photos look really good (even when zoomed in), wireless connection excellent (no connection issues). So far my battery life has been 6hrs; but let me say I did not turn off wireless or Bluetooth. My screen brightness was on maximum. I played Need for Speed briefly, surfed the web alot (3-4 hours), downloaded apps and files, looked at several youtube videos. I think the speaker quality is good; picture quality OK; used tango and talked to hubby while he was at work.Remember this tablet is thicker than the Ipad 2, Samsung, etc; some may experience fatigue from holding it long periods of time. I typed this entire review on the keyboard. I like it and unless something really bad happens in the next 13 days I plan to keep it.07/19/11 UPDATED REVIEW -- Well I decide to update my review. (I was able to purchase the tablets early at Fry's on 07/05/11) I had the sleep issue and called Toshiba the first time on 07/07/11. While they were nice there was no resolution given. So I exchanged by tablet at Fry's on 07/08/11. Then my husband's tablet had the issue. I decided to be patient and started surfing the internet to see if anyone else was having the problem. Slowly, I saw more postings about this problem. My new tablet was starting to have a sleep issue too and rebooting by itself. I called Toshiba again on 07/13/11 and the rep told me that he had never heard of that problem before. By 07/15/11 it was on Toshiba's thrive forums and the internet extensively. I even looked to see if it was an Android issue that plagued other tablets. My 14 days to return the tablets for a refund were quickly approaching and I was hoping that Toshiba sent an update or that some of the fixes would work. While I realize any technology can have hiccups I felt that I needed to decide what to do. I did not want to be stuck with a problematic tablet.  I returned both tablets last weekend.I been checking the internet and I am glad to see that Toshiba finally realizes they need to fix this issue. I am surprise that it never showed up in testing. I hope it is a software issue and not a hardware issue because I am sure some of you have met your return time limits. I still think the tablet has some really nice features and I hope they work them out. I decided to buy the Xoom- no surprises.", "Date": "July 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Toshiba Thrive Review, a great product!", "Author": "Galal Hazzi \"Gello\"", "ReviewID": "R146IEY8ODNHNZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the Toshiba last weekend and I couldn't be happier, the tablet does everything I needed it to do. First, I would like to address some issues that some people and reviewers complained about.The sleep issue: some people complained that the tablet when going to sleep mode it does not turn on again unless the whole tablet is restarted. The issue does exist, although it happened to me once in a week, but Toshiba acknowledged the issue and is now working on a fix and will be out soon so lets just move past that.The size issue: well this will be a matter of preference, are the ports, expandibility and connectivity worth the trade off? To me the answer is yes. Im personally tired of Apple manipulating the consumer in order to make more money. Apple refuses to offer ports to make you buy adapters, they refuse to have a removable battery, even on phones (all phones have removable batteries except for Apple), because they want you to buy the battery from them and also have it installed by Apple and they charge you money for the installation. So,if you have an issue with the battery not only you pay for the battery, you also pay for the installation and don't try to do it yourself because you will void the warranty. Also, this tablet is not that much thicker or havier than most of the tablets out there, it might be heavy and thick on the spec. Sheet but it sure feels good in your hand especially with the rubberized back.Lack of flash in the back camera: well lets face it, even phone cameras with flash don't produce good images in low light conditions. Plus, did you really buy a tablet to take pictures? I don't think so. If you really wanna go this route you can use your phone camera or your point and shoot camera. Cameras on tablets are meant for video conferencing more than anything elseand the Thrive does that well.The battery: some people didn't like the fact that the battery gets depleted in one or two days of heavy use. Well, the charger provided with the tablet charges the battery in 1 hour! Try to beat that. Plus unless you are planning to use the tablet in the desert then you should be able to charge your tablet before the end of the two days.Now lets talk about the good stuff!Pros: Fast and responsive: apps, screens and the internet load fast, even keyboard responsiveness is great Ports and expandability: Full USB port, HDMI port and SD card slot. I love the SD card slot because unlike Apple iPad, it gives you options. You might need a 16 gb tablet today but what if you get a different job tomorrow or your needs change for any reason? With the iPad all what you can do is to put it on eBay and buy a bigger memory which is capped at 64gb, with the Thrive, just buy an SD card or save your work on a flash memory or even an external hard drive (full USB support remember?) Screen: I like the screen, I really didn't get the chance to put it next to an iPad but the screen resolution and color look great to me. Its very comfortable for reading, I do a lot of reading using the Kindle app., yet performs great for gaming and videos' which I do occasionally. Printer share app: this is the easiest and fastest way I have seen and experienced that make printing from a tablet a breathe. The app allows you to print from multiple sources and apps on the tablet via any wifi or Bluetooth printer available in range. I was able to print a PDF file sent to my email using the wireless printer in my room. The app detected the printer right away and printed the document in seconds. File manager: that's the only tablet that comes with a file manager that makes it easy to navigate through your files, documents, pictures etc.., exactly like you do on your PC and you can also create folders etc.. Camera quality: I think that the camera quality is great especially for a tablet or a mobile device in general. Removable battery: you can remove the battery and change it so you can have a new battery when the current battery is depleted or when you just feel like having an extra battery just in case. Back covers: I personally like the stock black back cover but I appreciate the fact that Toshiba thought about this and offered it, I think its a great way to customize your tablet by choosing from multiple colors, fast and easy.Cons: Android 3.1: definitely needs a little tweaking, there are minor issues across the board but overall I'll give it a 9 out of 10. Plus, all these issues im sure they will be ironed out in the next version or update of android. Apps: definitely the android market lacks tablet specific apps, the number of apps is much less than the ipad and the phone apps that look good on the tablet. Developers should accelerate their efforts and develop more apps and games for honeycomb. One of the main reasons people wrennot buying honeycomb tablets as much as the Ipad, is the number of apps available for download that are tablet specific. Lacks accessories: I really can't complain much here because the tablet just came out so hopefully in the future there will be more cases and stuff.Overall, I think the Thrive is a terrific tablet and it gets the job, any job done and done fast and I would definitely recommend this tablet to any one looking to buy a tablet and by the way this review was written on my Thrive using the on screen keyboard and it functions great. Typing was responsive although I was tyoing fast, exactly like if typing on my PC, there was no lag or any issues.", "Date": "July 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best Android tablet yet", "Author": "Bolster", "ReviewID": "R3O2GG6380L75D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In today's tablet market, there are a lot of choices.  If price is no object, you could easily be drawn to a 64 gb Ipad 2, which would give you a reliable, user-friendly package with plenty of onboard storage.  Ios 5 has also brought wireless syncing with Itunes and cloud storage.  With a great selection of apps, and strict quality control on the hardware and software, Apple is really tough to beat.So why buy an Android tablet? Maybe you hate Apple.  Maybe you love native Flash support in your browser.  Maybe you like more flexibility from your desktop layout, to storage and peripherals.  A lot of people go straight to the Samsung Galaxy Tab instead of the Ipad 2, seeing the Samsung as an Android Ipad, and why not - it is thin and light, has flashy aluminum on the back, and has a great display like the Ipad.For me, the Ipad was both expensive and restrictive, so I went looking for the Anti-Ipad.  I wanted expandible memory, the ability to plug in a flash drive, independence from Itunes, and I wanted it to be rugged.  It also needed a great display, needed to be comfortable to hold, and needed to be reliable.  That left me with the Toshiba Thrive and Acer Iconia A500 to choose between.I initally bought the Acer, as it had good reviews and the price was right under $400.  Three days with the A500 left me disappointed.  It would go into a coma instead of going to sleep.  The battery would drain, and it wasn't comfortable for me to hold, just like my wife's Ipad, because it was too thin.  For me, there is a point when something is so thin it becomes hard to hold, which is why screwdrivers all have handles of a certain size, and why coffee mug handles do too, as well as why the handles on pliers flare out instead of closing to the point where they would meet- it's about comfort.I returned the Acer (I still have an A100 that I use when I want something smaller) and ordered the 16 gb Thrive from Amazon.  I knew it was among the heaviest, and most likely the thickest tablet there is, but I had a feeling it was what I was looking for.  As a bonus, it had a full-sized HDMI out, takes up to 128 gb SDXC cards, has a removable battery (who else offers this?) and a rubberized back for easier grip.  Like just about every other tablet, phone, mp3 player, and toothbrush these days, it has 2 cameras.So with about 3 weeks of daily use, this has been everything I wanted. I ordered a 64gb sdxc card, dropped my favorite music and movies onto it, and have room for tons of storage left.  Around the house, wifi reception is great, and I get good reception anywhere, whereas I sometimes had poor reception with the A500. Like all Android tablets, there are seemingly endless apps in any imagineable category, and Netflix streaming now works without having to fiddle with various workarounds.SIZE/WEIGHTThe device is comfortable to hold in either portrait or landscape mode, and the border around the display lets my finger/thumbs rest without accidentally taping on something.  Does it weigh a lot? I don't think so.  The difference between my wife's Ipad and the Thrive are negligible, and the Thrive is more comfortable to hold, and the same is true vs. the HP Touchpad, which weighs about the same, but is as big (or small) as an Ipad 1.  Its weight is hidden in how comfortable it is to hold.  As for size, a tablet just needs to fit in a suitcase, small bag, or backpack, which the Thrive does with ease.  It is thick, but never seems too big, or behind the tech curve.  Toshiba isn't hiding vacuum tubes inside, they made it bigger because it is easier to work with.  If it was a cell phone, this would have been a mistake, but full-sized tablets don't fit in your pocket, no matter what brand.ON THE GOThis is where battery life, storage capacity, and connectivity either help or hurt you.  Go somewhere without wifi, and there's no cloud access, no downloading, no streaming.  Having your music and movies onboard makes this a non-issue.  I can easily get 7 hours out of the battery if I turn off the wifi and just watch movies. An extra battery doubles that.  If I need to plug in, I am not teathered to a 3-foot cord, like many tablets have. I can be several feet away from an outlet and not have to hold it awkwardly because the cord is too short.  Charging seems to be reasonably fast, which is another plus.THE SCREENThis is what the user looks at all the time. The screen looks great.  Colors are good, brightness is enough to use outside, and the screen responds well, too.SOUNDThe speakers are not huge, and won't blow you away.  HP's touchpad has better speakers, maybe it's just that the slots are bigger and let more sound out.  They are adequate.PORTSThe USB port works as a host.  I have used it to charge my Ipod. It sometimes wants a reboot before it will recognize some flash drives, but it has not had any serious problems, and is a real plus.  HDMI out works immediately, and gives you the ability to stream Netflix to a hotel TV in a snap. Full sized SD card is very flexible, but I sometimes have trouble with micro SD cards reading.  It could be the adapter itself, but i can plug the micro SD into a USB card reader and there is no trouble reading that way.NEGATIVES1) No charging through USB. It would be nice, but even the Ipad requires a wall charger.  The Thrive's charger is just like a netbook charger with a small brick.  This has not been a problem, but it would be nice if it was smaller.2) Android 3.1 isn't always stable. Probably not Toshiba's fault, but apps crash sometimes, which is a rarity with Ios stuff.  I hope 4.0 will be better.3) The power button is hard to find sometimes.  You won't accidentally hit it, unless you're going for the volume rocker right next to it.  I also like the home button to be a real, bonafide button, rather than the one on the screen.  Only Apple and HP have a real button on their hardware for this.  I like a real button because hitting it is always intentional, and an accidental sweep of it doesn't send you home.4) No flash for the rear camera.  I think it's absurd to hold up a tablet and start taking photos, as I can't believe anyone would use a tablet primarily for this, but since they have a camera, why not put a flash in with it, like others have?  I do have a device that is made for this, and will always do a better job, though. It's called a camera.  Also, Acer did it right by offsetting the cameras so landscape mode doesn't cause you to inadvertently cover the camera.CONCLUSIONMy advice to people who don't want an Ipad for whatever reason is to seriously consider the Thrive. Everything else has compromises and limitations, and nothing else is as rugged.  You will need to buy a protector to prevent the plastic or aluminum from being scratched on everything else.  Asus has the transformer, which I have not tried, but I didn't want to spend an extra $150 for a keyboard and USB (it's really a matter of what each person values).  The Thrive is unique, and in a good way.", "Date": "October 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "The most flexible of them all", "Author": "gus octel \"gus\"", "ReviewID": "R1T9L4LWO8EKB4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I returned the Iconia when I found out the Thrive was going to have Honey Comb 3.1 a SD card, a REAL HDMI port not a mini, a removable battery and an electrical cable longer than 20 inches (a total joke you will find on the Iconia.)They both offer endless memory expansion with a USB thumb drive but the Thrive lets me easily plug in and out a dozen SD cards quickly.  The Iconia has a mini SD and it is painful.  You will not switch out one card for another.The Ipad and its closed architecture are NOT for people who know how to use computers.Let me be brief so you can read the rest of the review on these stellar products.  On more than one occasion the contents of the IPad have disappeared due to ITunes Sync issues.  Nothing and I mean nothing beats the drag and drop of files onto the Android tablet.  When you are done delete them as opposed to doubling your storage needs, a copy on the computer and one on the Ipad is a pain.All three IPads that I tested ALL had wireless G/N connectivity issues; regardless of the router brand they constantly lose the connection.The Iconia and Thrive kick Apple to the curb on that technical glitch.  Apples solution is to force you to use N only on the router but this does not solve the connection problem.  Add the closed design of ITunes to manage everything with zero built in ports and just forget it.Enter Thrive over the Galaxy and over the Iconia.  What you get here is Honeycomb 3.1,  the email client alone is a step up.  On the Iconia with 3.0 if you wanted to create email in anything other than Gmail you had to enter all the inbound/outbound crap.  Thrive with 3.1 automatically figures that out for the most popular email systems.Add the USB port and the full SD card and you have instant access to an UNLIMITED library of material when you are on the road.  Take your SD chip out of your camera and you are instantly looking at your photos.  Carry a few SD cards with your music tastes, specific presentations per industry or client type or a bunch of ripped movies for a 10 hour flight and you get the idea.  Why be limited by fixed storage.Honest case in point, my family came off a plane today, the car was dead in the airport lot. While waiting for AAA we took the SD card out of the vacation camera that just landed, popped it into the Thrive and watched an hour of photos talking about the trip with those who had not been there while we waited for AAA.  Productive and keeps the kids busy.Next test will be compact flash adapter that will shortly get plugged into the USB slot.Go to any hotel/presentation room with your $10 HDMI cable or walk into any story if you forgot it and instantly connect with a FULL size standard cable.  The Iconia uses a mini HDMI, just one more pain in the you know what to go and find if you lose the original.  Never mind lost the sale if you cannot connect to a panel.  Just about everyone has a standard HDMI cable in presentation rooms today.The pluses on the Thrive are endless but the weight is killer, it's heavy and thick.  Add the Toshiba versatile rotating carry case and it's huge but it is a price I am more than willing to pay for all the connectivity ports.  This is a Swiss army knife of Tablets.The Iconia I must tell you with 3.0 was faster on connecting to internet pages. And I mean lightning fast!!! I have to blame 3.1 like any OS update since the processor is the same on both.  I don't know if the wireless adapter card on the Iconia is a better or faster unit.  Here the Iconia beat the Thrive but it might lose this edge when the Iconia updates to 3.1.If you are on the road the endless power with removable batteries is great, it just keeps on ticking.Another issue regarding power: the Iconia provides you a useless 20 inch electrical cable.  The Thrive has the equivalent of a laptop small power adapter and 6 or more feet of cable.  FORGET the idea that you will use a universal mini or micro USB plug to power either the Iconia or the Thrive; NOT GOING TO happen, just buy a universal adapter that works on your laptop and then switch connector for the tablet.So far, the Thrive wins hands down.Other Cons on the Thrive so you know it's not perfect.  The power button is too recessed on my unit.

I picked one up and all I can say is that I love it! Aside from a few Honeycomb 3.1 quirks, and the fact the Thrive is a little thicker than its competition, it feels solid in my hands and responds smoothly and quickly to my touch.  One of the things that has me really happy is the full size SD card and the full size USB port!  For twenty dollars I doubled my memory with a 16GB SD card, lets see the Samsung Tab or IPad do that.  I've been using it non-stop for five days and so far no crashes or freezing up.  The battery life is ok, however the battery charges faster then my cell phone.  I can pretty my charge the tablet in an hour, not to shabby.

After working with it for a few weeks, I'm finding the Toshiba is a solid product and credible alternative to other Android tablets and iPad.In terms of construction quality, the Toshiba is beefy and solid feeling. Most surfaces are covered in a rubbery non-slip material, and although it's slightly heavier and thicker than most competitors, it still feels right in your hands. The screen is reasonably high quality...to me, not quite as readable as Apple's, but certainly more than adequate. Touch screen performance is very good, and unlike some other models, I find it easy to interact with it, even for objects right near the edge of the screen. I'm generally more of a physical keyboard fan, but Toshiba's touchscreen seemed more appealing than most.The Android implementation is generally very good, and it seems more stable than previous versions. Still, I've had a few application crashes on the Toshiba, but it's difficult to know whether it's Android, the app developer or the Toshiba. Overall, I'd have no trouble recommending it for day-to-day use, even for demanding users. One particular issue I've been having is connecting to my corporate secure network. It's locked with a WPA2 key, and while I have other Android devices working fine, the Toshiba seems to struggle. It's worked fine on other networks I've tried - including others protected with WPA2 - but for some reason, the network I use most often seems to be difficult.Where the Toshiba really shines is expansion capabilities. It supports Bluetooth 3.0, giving you access to keyboards, mice, headsets and so on. It has standard USB ports, meaning you can easily attach things like external disk drives. It has an SD card slot, making on-board storage almost limitless, since you can easily carry as many SD cards as you like. It even has HDMI and a fairly strong docking station, so when you're in the office, you can use your desktop monitor and keyboard, making the Toshiba a PC replacement for less demanding tasks. Indeed, one of the first apps I installed is virtual desktop client software, letting me have my full Windows desktop, right on the Toshiba. In large companies with virtual desktop initiatives, these devices make very cool endpoint devices.The cameras are about average for this type of product. If you have the bandwidth, video conferences are possible, and stills are good enough so that the Toshiba makes a great barcode scanner. I was able to get a usable scan of a 2x2 inch QR code from about two feet - better than most. Still, I'm not giving up my DSLR yet.The only reservation I might have is about whether you want cellular (3G/4G) network integration. Devices like the Toshiba Thrive generally mean you'll need to be carrying a cell phone, and if you want to network your tablet in a place where 802.11 WiFi networks aren't available, it can get complex. Certainly, many modern smartphones can act as a WiFi hotspot, or you can pair via Bluetooth or cables, so there are ways to have mobile access. But, if you're looking for that all-in-one, use it anywhere experience, you might prefer integrated 3G/4G capabilities.Cellular networking feels like the only obvious omission to me, so if you're the type who seems to always be in range of an 802.11 signal, then I definitely recommend you check out the Toshiba Thrive.", "Date": "July 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Thrive great for world travel-Updated Dec 2012", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RIOPM149EKAFJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "See my second update at the end: Dec 2012I bought my 16Gb Toshiba Trive 6 weeks ago for two types of travel: long airplane flights to and travel in Africa, and electronic charts and plates for flying our airplane. I couldn't be happier with my purchase. And I've found some benefits beyond my original reasons for purchase.As for charts and plates in our airplane the iPad is the standard for pilots. But the iPad is a closed system.  We have Windows PCs and a Windows 7 Phone other than my wife's Android phone.  So adding an Apple product just wasn't going to work. I found Android apps that will do all I need in the airplane.  I don't need the Thrive for locating the plane on approach plates as can be done with the iPad.  I have two aviation GPSs in the plane.  They already do a great job.  I just want to replace the 20 pounds of charts and plates I currently haul around in the plane.  The Thrive can do that just fine. Though the Trive is heavier than the iPad for mounting on the yoke.Foreign travel is where the Thrive really shines. In both Mali and Uganda reliable Wifi is hard to come by.  So I had to preload most of what I was going to use before leaving the land of prevalent Wifi. Here's how I prepared for my latest trip:1) I loaded my 32Gb SD card with 32 movies before I departed for Africa.  The Thrive requires conversion of the movies from AVI to MP4 for the stock player.  So I had to get some software to do the conversion. That software is very slow. But it works.  Update 12/14/11 - QQPlayer plays AVI movies no problem.2) I loaded a 16Gb SD card with all of my music.3) I loaded copies of all my critical files in the Thrive internal memory.4) I downloaded a number of ePub books for FBReader and a couple Amazon books for the Kindle app.5) I purchased the Larousse English-French dictionary and Petite Larousse.  All data is stored locally so is usable without a Wifi connection.6) I got all of the newspaper readers I regularly use, particularly the New York Times reader, for use whenever I have wifi access. Otherwise I use my Windows 7 Phone which uses my cell connection for newspapers, Facebook and email.7) I purchased the full version of Office Suite for creating and editing Word docs and Excel spreadsheets.8) I loaded some games and utilities that I might need.9) Then in addition to the standard Toshiba case I purchased a case for the Thrive that has an integrated USB keyboard. And I got a bluetooth mouse ($17 at Fry's).  The keyboard works great!10) I have British and French plug converters for the battery charger. And I was set to go.Flights to either West or East Africa take 24 hours from the US West Coast with one or two layovers.  On the longest leg I worked on an MS Word document using Office Suite for a couple hours.  Then after watching two full length movies using QQPlayer I swapped SD cards and switched to reading books in FBReader while listening to my music in RealPlayer with good noise cancelling headphones.  It was the most pleasant of the many flights I've made to Africa. After 9 hours of continuous use of the Thrive on the longest flight I still had 15% battery and it was playing music with almost no further drop in battery availability.  The Thrive battery recharged in a little over an hour in the Amsterdam airport.Now here in Africa I use the Thrive almost every day both for reading a book while I'm waiting for a meal to be prepared or watching a movie in the evening if I haven't fired up my big 17\" Toshiba Satellite laptop. I can use the Thrive for hours even when the power's out because of the long battery life. African power is always intermittent. So battery life is quite important.The Thrive is perfect for downloading pictures from my Canon digital camera for showing friends pictures I've brought with me or have recently taken.  The folks here love seeing pictures on the tablet.  It's so much nicer than peering at pictures on the tiny camera screen.  And while viewing the photos of themselves zooming in using the touch screen is a real hit. Then I can transfer the recent photos onto a friend's flash drive so they have a copy of the pictures to keep. I use the laptop for more permanent storage of photos.  But the Thrive is so portable, quick to boot up, and easy for friends to use the touch screen I use it almost exclusively when visiting.On long drives on African roads I break out my Thrive and put it in the keyboard case.  I can hold the tablet on my lap and use the keyboard for writing reports.  I don't have to worry about bouncing around a spinning hard drive like I would if I tried using my big laptop in a vehicle. The laptop stays in it's case when on the road.There is a problem using the Thrive in a vehicle on the road.  When it's sunny out, which is quite often the case here in Africa, I have to manipulate the tablet into partial shade to be able to see the screen. This is true whether I'm composing documents or reading books. In direct sunlight the screen is difficult to see. I have a daytime setting in FBReader that increases the screen brightness that helps some.  But the Thrive is not a Kindle reader.  That said, the Thrive is great for reading a book in bed with the lights out.  A friend has to use a portable light to illuminate her Kindle. The Thrive screen is quite bright for reading in the dark with no external illumination.Both the pre-installed File Manager and ES File Explorer do a good job of manipulating  files on the Thrive.  I regularly copy backup versions of documents I create on the tablet onto a flash drive. Or I can plug the tablet into my laptop to place a backup copy on the laptop drive. It's this file manipulation flexibility that really sold me on the Thrive. I have not been disappointed.Now that I use a touch screen on both my cell phone and the Thrive tablet I find myself trying to touch my laptop screen rather than use the mouse. I have the mouse for the tablet.  But I only use it when I'm doing concentrated composing or editing in  Office Suite. Otherwise the touch screen works great.Being a touch typist I could tell immediately I need the external keyboard for document work on the Thrive. Placing your fingers over the home row on the tablet screen keyboard just causes a lot of extraneous letter touches since it's static electricity that activates the screen, not finger pressure. To type on the screen keyboard it's better to be a hunt-and-peck typist since you are only touching one screen letter at a time.Some day when Toshiba and Google enable Android tablets to use a cell modem I'll be able to leave my big heavy laptop at home and just use the Toshiba tablet while traveling. Wifi is not readily available outside the developed countries. Right now if I need something from the Internet I have to retrieve it on my laptop then transfer it to the Thrive unless I'm in a capital city and can find Wifi at a hotel or office.Here in Africa the Thrive and my Windows 7 phone with a local SIM card in it get most of the use. I only have to crank up my laptop for serious Internet surfing and using Photoshop for organizing my photos and posting them on Facebook.  If I have Wifi access I can post on Facebook from my Thrive tablet.  But that's not very often.The Toshiba Thrive has proven to be a real addition to the tools I use while traveling. It far exceeds my original expectations. My wife joins me in Uganda in a couple of weeks.  We'll see what additional uses she'll find for the tablet since her Android phone isn't GSM and won't work outside the US. We only have one headset to plug into the Thrive for audio in movies and music. We'll see how sharing works.UPDATE 12/14/2011 - back home - I've had my Thrive for 4 monthsAfter my wife joined me in Uganda we left the big laptop at the NGO office in Kampala and just used the Thrive tablet for the next 3 weeks. It worked great as a laptop substitute while traveling.Wifi: We rarely had Wifi access in Uganda. So for the regular emails we send home to family and friends I composed them on the Thrive in Office Suite Pro. (Stick with DOC format - the DOCX format still has a few issues.) I transferred the Word format document to a flash drive. Then it was quick and cheap to go to an Internet cafe and send the email with the document from the flash drive as an attachment. For my next trip I now have a Motorola Droid 3 which I'll use as a wireless hotspot for the Thrive using the local cellular service. I've tested it at home and it works great.File Management: Our son is a Linux jockey. So he showed me how to use the samba feature in ES File Explorer. Now that we're home again I have the Thrive connected to our home wireless network. In ES File Explorer select LAN. Then just press the search button near the top. It finds all of the Windows computers on our home network. Every shared drive or folder on the networked PCs is now available on the Thrive. So you don't have to use a flash drive as an intermediary for transferring files to the Thrive internal storage or SD card. Just use ES File Explorer and do a much faster file transfer back and forth between the Thrive and the folders in any networked PC using Wifi.Daily Usage: I find I'm using the Thrive everyday for reading email and for reading my NY Times subscription and many world newspapers using Pulse and News360. The Gmail and Email readers are much easier to use on the Thrive than on my Motorola Droid 3 or even the PC versions. The Thrive versions give you a split screen view. Quick scanning and weeding out emails is easy.Updates: I have all the latest updates on my Thrive which is version 3.2.  All of the earlier reported problems such as unexpected shutdowns are gone.Adobe has an updated version of basic Photoshop for Honeycomb now. It's PS Touch. It replaces the earlier Photoshop Express which was pretty useless. PS Touch now gives you tools to edit a single photo. You still can't make slideshows or albums such as you can with PS Elements on the PC. But I was able to crop and increase brightness and contrast to greatly improve a photo of a young Batwa (pygmy) girl next to her hut.I travel to Angola next month. My longest flight is 17 hours. I'll be pushing my Thrive to the limit. I'm set up with entertainment for the flights.  The Thrive charges in 1 hr. So I can prepare it for subsequent flights during layovers. I have my plug adapters for the charger.Movies: I can rent movies from the Google Android Market shortly before I depart. I can \"pin\" them to the device which downloads the movie to the tablet rather than streaming it. I'll put them on my SD card. I'll have 30 days in which to start viewing the movie.Music: I've got my entire collection synched in WMA format to the SD card. WMA is compact with still decent quality. So I'll have plenty of good music to listen to with my noise cancelling headphones.Books: While listening to my tunes I'll read books I check out from our county library in ePub format. I'll check them out just before departure so I have the full 21 days to read them.  I also have some classics loaded for later. I'm happy to not have to lug around 10 pounds of books to have sufficient reading material for weekslong trips.I'm continuing to find new uses and features for the Thrive. It serves me well both at home and for extensive travel.Update #1 3/18/2012I continue to use the Thrive on a regular basis. We recently took our grandsons to Kenya and Tanzania to go on safari in the Masai Mara and Serengeti. The grandsons are 8 and 12. They used the Thrive to play Angry Birds and a few other games to while away the hours on long travel stretches. It takes at least 24 hours to travel to East Africa from the Pacific NW. The Thrive really helped when the younger boy found out his Nintendo DS charger wouldn't work outside the US because the charger is 120 volt only and the rest of the world uses 240 volt power. The Thrive charger is of course usable on either voltage. So the Thrive got a workout.After my wife and the grandsons went home I continued on to Uganda. The grandsons took the Thrive with them for the plane ride home. I used my new smaller Acer Aspire 13.6 inch laptop and my cell phones. I found the laptop - international cell phone combination works great. The Thrive and a cell phone work equally well in most cases. So the Thrive in countries where a smartphone can be used for Web access can be an option to carrying a laptop.Update #2 12/11/2012The Thrive now sits in a drawer most of the time. In comparison to newer 7 inch tablets the Thrive is a slow dog. I got a bargain on a Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus. The smaller size is much easier to handle. And it's fast. With 16Gb plus a 32Gb microSD card there's tons of storage in the Galaxy. I had thought the 7 inch size would be too small for reading charts and approach plates in our airplane. But I just flew with the 7 inch tablet and it worked well. It's much lighter and quicker to respond than the Thrive. The GPS does seem to be a bit more accurate in the Thrive. But not by much.The other problem with the Thrive in comparison to newer tablets is slow wireless. The Thrive must just be 802.1g, not 802.1n. The slow wireless speed of the Thrive is maddening at times. Wireless reception is also much weaker in the Thrive than in newer tablets and phones. At this time the Thrive is out of date. There are better choices available.", "Date": "October 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "What I Think of the Two Toshiba THRiVES Pruchased with 32gb SD Cards", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"NoClue-Really!\"", "ReviewID": "R1PT48UIAD1WAP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "20120626 UPDATE (THIS IS IMPORTANT) - The MOG app uses \"*read sensitive log data\" permission -- The THRiVE is still the best tablet on the market this is just one of the \"bad\" things app writer's (both Apple and Android) do to unsuspecting users.

Several weeks later, this moment is only a memory!20120420 UPDATE - There are notes scattered below of changes or new information.  Here is one that may be useful.  To make listening more comfortable, I initially added the Cyber Acoustics AC-204 Headset&Mic; w/PC Y-Adapter (a necessity for Google Voice since the 903+, mentioned next, only operates as a headset on the THRiVE); however, I have migrated to the Plantronics BackBeat 903+ Headset for Music/Video and my cell phone - both of these are available \"Prime\" on Amazon.com.WE BOUGHT TWO AND THIS IS WHAT WE THINK ABOUT THEM!I looked for a tablet that met my needs.  The iPad is way to proprietary for me and I do not use/like the iTunes closed environment.  I also looked at the Xoom and the now defunct HP.  I read about many others.  Here is why I chose the Toshiba THRiVE tablet over any of the other tablets available and have been using it for several months now.1.  User replaceable/changeable battery that gives some 11 hours of usage (my longest continuous was 16 hours - of course, doing work that involved no movies, no video, and for grins and giggles I uninstalled the apps that unnecessarily consume battery and those apps that launch for no good reason at boot time and just run even when there is no need).2.  The spare battery allows me some 22 hours of time.  I have run four (4) full length movies on one charge and there is plenty of battery charge remaining to do more stuff.  If you travel long distances whether by airline, train, car, boat, etc., you will appreciate the time the THRiVE gives you with its replaceable battery.  The \"grand\" iPad dies after a few short hours unless one has an extension cord or a power source to keep it running which means you must be okay with being tethered to an automobile's battery or a power outlet (if available).3.  Two fully functional USB ports.  One for the stuff in the toy collection that needs a large USB connector; and, one for the other stuff in the collection that needs a small USB connector.4.  Though not suggested or recommended, it is possible for the THRiVE to be connected to a desktop and act as a drive.  You will need to do your own research to learn more!5.  The THRiVE has a standard SD card slot.  A few of the other tablets have a microSD card slot.  The THRiVE offers 128gb SDXC (yes, that is an 'X') card usage capability.  128gb is not really what I need at the moment but I am glad I can upsize to 128gb should I need it in the future.  Two 32gb class 10 SDHC (yes, that is an 'H') cards are pre-loaded with video and music and apps when I am on flights lasting as long as 13 hours.  Unless first class is affordable, there are usually no outlets in the back-of-the-plane.  The EuroRail offers 220 outlets that are suitable for the THRiVE without buying additional power modules (an adapter for the power plug is required to fit the power sockets).  The SD cards give me the capability of having a tremendous amount of material to keep me occupied whether video, music, work, or whatever.6.  The 10 inch screen is very readable and the refresh rate is very good.  The color appears to be good even though I have not done anything to color correct it.  It fortunately does NOT seem to have that garish color saturation for the fake \"vivid\" look.7.  The THRiVE does not have to be \"rooted\" or \"jailbroken\" like some devices (iPad is the most notible) to provide some great features and wonderful capabilities that are highly desirable.8.  The Kindle app is available from the android market (20120420-now called Google Play) as are other great apps to meet probably most, if not all, of your needs.  It is important to get the google account!  Remember, like all of the tablets, it is a \"cloud\" device and connection to the \"cloud\" is an absolute MUST!  Next, so you will never be disappointed with an app, it will be a very good use of your time to login, using your THRiVE account at Google.com, to the android market from a desktop and then find the apps that seem like something suitable for you.  The android market will use your THRiVE login and the developer information to inform you if the app will work with Honeycomb 3.1 (your THRiVE's operating system) and the Toshiba tablet.  Please do this.  You will read a lot of comments from folks about apps they tried to use, on their tablet/smartphone, but did not check to learn if the app would work on their device.9.  The THRiVE has been traveling with me for some time.  It always has worked as it should.  It works even better when the developer creates a proper app that knows when the \"cloud\" is present and prepares itself to know how to work when the \"cloud\" is temporarily unavailable!10.  There are many more features and capabilities provided by the Toshiba THRiVE that set it apart from the other tablets that caused me to buy two (2) of them.  I am trying to get time to play with all of the THRiVE's features and capabilities.11.  The THRiVE works flawlessly with my Pogoplugs so that I can stream/download video via Wi-Fi at the brick-and-mortor places I have tried this.  Of course, I can put the THRiVE to work listening to my music on my Pogoplugs, vi Wi-Fi, while I do other things on the THRiVE.12.  If you are lucky enough to have, and can afford, a Mi-Fi or a Car-Fi the THRiVE's capabilities and features work flawlessly keeping you at work and entertained.13.  20111011 UPDATE ... How could I forget!  The next best thing to a user-replacable battery is a battery recharge that takes a discharged battery and fully recharges it about one (1) hour.  The importance of this is that those two or more hours of \"sit\" time, in an airport, waiting for the next leg of the flight allows me to totally recharge both my batteries and use the THRiVE at the same time.14.  20111013 UPDATE ... When reviewing an apps' permission, do make sure the \"Show All\" is clicked so that you can view the permissions that are not popular for a developer to use yet the permissions are used because they can be used and the use is not necessarily for the benefit of the THRiVE user.Ya just have to admit that Toshiba and its THRiVE was the first tablet that was done correctly from the get-go!Short comings (of wireless, developers, and ... that limit the THRiVE)1.  The THRiVE is a cloud device like the Xoom, the iPad, the xxx, etc. and is limited in what it can do once it is away from the internet.  This limitation is mostly the fault of the developer of the app that forgets that Wi-Fi is not every where as one might think or is told.  There are really places in these United States that are devoid of McDonalds, BurgerKings, and the like.  When this happens, the interaction with the internet goes dark, very DARK!  3g/4g is no better.  Unlike the advertisements where the wireless vendors would like you to believe that 3g/4g is pervasive, it is NOT if you leave the city/metropolitian areas.2.  The so called \"unlimited\" 3g/4g data packages are \"capped\" and very expensive.  If you take a moment and read the fine print that I have read in the data service contracts it really limits what can be done with their 2, 5, 10 gig data plans (fine print from one wireless privider indicated if you use to much of your \"unlimited\" plan they can disconnect your service -- how does one use to much of \"unlimited?\").  I think T-Mobile is the exception at the moment but this may not be so for long with the eminent purchase by another wireless provider (?).  A movie is about 4gb to download/stream unless you buy/obtain the movie and then dumb it down (lower the resolution/size) with software available at some retail outlets/online.  The wireless vendors also control the speed available to the device at the tower.  I can tether my old Motorola Razr (vintage 2007 - D and EV capable) to my computer and use a real \"unlimited\" data plan that is grandfathered at $30/mth that has gone, when tower allowed, to 1,000Kbps for extended periods when in the right place.3.  The THRiVE cannot access the Whisper Net like the 3g versions of the Kindle.  Even the \"crappy\" experimental browser on the Kindle is better than a cell phone, Wi-Fi, laptop, iPad, Nook, etc. when there is no other access.  \"I know!\"  I was in the middle of no where on the EuroRail in Europe just East of the French border and I needed information.  Nothing, from unlocked SIMM'd cell, to ... woked except the Kindle, it's \"crappy\" experimental browser, and Whisper Net.  The \"silk\" browser of the \"Fire\" kindle is supposed to be much, much, better?4.  The THRiVE might be a little heavy for some of the critics.  If you are like me and travel with a backpack it is no big deal.  The provided default non-skid back has been a lifesaver - granted, it is not pretty but I do not need pretty!5.  Since the rage is the \"black\" appearing screen we are stuck with it.  Like laptops, and other displays, the \"black\" appearing screen is for indoor office/home use.  The designers forgot about us folks that are of the out-of-doors sorts.  It has a mechanism that really tries to make the screen bright enough to see in the sunlight that does only a minimal amount of good.  Fortunately, a shadow can often be made that allows the eyes to adjust and the screen can be seen a whole lot better than a smartphone.6.  A netbook, a laptop, and a desktop offer some privacy that is not in the scope of how things seem to work in the tablet/smartPhone cloud environment.  App Permissions MUST be carefully checked (check the apps Permissions from a desktop/laptop connected to the Android market).  Some apps watch and disseminate everything that is done and will continue to do so 24x7x365.  As an example, think of it this way.  There are certain apps where the coordinates of every bathroom stop made every day can be sent out into the internet along with any other information the developer chose to include while the device is carried and power to the device is enabled.  The only way to stop this behavior permanently is to uninstall the app.  The way to tolerate and coexist with this behavior is to review the intent of the app and plan what you do accordingly (20111027 - this context must be applied to the list of apps below for your use).  When the tablet is not being used, totally power down (this would be the same as removing the battery if the provided on-off switch were not available).  Another way is to uninstal the app when it is not useful (this is not painful and is for the most part a rather quick process unlike what most of us have experienced in the Microsoft world).  With more research in the Android market, there is probably another app that will more than likely do the same thing and be less intrusive and invasive.  I mostly go for the \"free\" apps and NEVER, never, the ones that have advertisements!7.  It is important to have something watch for malicious apps.  \"Yes!\"  there are evil people masterminding \"tricks\" to steal anything and everything (processing time, identity, passwords, etc.).  Kaspersky, and Norton are probably the better tools designed for the Android tablet at the present time.  There are some free tools that have not-so-good reputations in the technical trade publications.8.  Android tablets are also thought of as Smart Phones seemingly because when Android was first marketed by Google, there were only smartphones and there were no Android tablets.  So, this might be a little confusing at first when the app only makes reference to smartphones.20111027 - UPDATE ... I am answering this question, \"What do I use on the THRiVE?\"  This is no endorsement of any of the Android apps, the developer(s), or any personal involvement (financial, ownership, etc.).  I like these apps because they do what I want-and-need until I find something better.  Keep in mind that some are particularly invasive to privacy, some use processor cycles that could be better used by another app, and some consume battery whether they are being used or not. The apps (in no particular order) ...20120420 - UPDATE ... Try \"Airplane Mode\" with the apps on the THRiVE.  Airplane mode often makes an app that tracks the device user workable so it becomes a way to manage \"some\" invasive apps that might otherwise be useful.  Just remember to either uninstall/\"Force Stop\" the app and clear cache when finished using it.  It if \"pops up\" on reboot it might be an app that has to be uninstalled when not in use.ANDROID APPS (I use - downloaded ONLY)A.  Pogoplug - It provides access at the tablet to my Pogoplug that I use to store my video, music, pictures, and other stuff that I want to access while I am out and about (encrypted with PKWare AES 256).  I do not really need it since I could go to <...> and do most of the same things if not more.  (20120420-PKWare has posted that it will make available a reader for the android market in the 2nd quarter 2012.  This is great news when one has to carry protected documents that now can be accessed on the THRiVE).B.  TripAdvisor - The online version was not all that interesting to me.  There apps do it right!  If you want to see what I mean, get one of them say, \"Hawaii Travel Guide or Los Angeles City Guide!\"  When one is traveling it is not always possible to be connected to the internet (like flying - and a legal requirement is to have the THRiVE in \"Airplane mode\" over the Pacific on an aircraft that is not Wi-Fi equipped or I do not want to pay the fee to use onboard Wi-Fi ... ).  TripAdvisor series of apps work where-you-are and when-you-need-them even if there is not internet connection (of course, an internet connection is necessary for updates to the apps and the data that can be done whenever).  These folks are responsive to a user's thoughts, comments and feedback.20120420-For some odd reason, the folks at TripAdvisor changed their strategy.  An internet connection is now a necessity to use their apps - I would rate this app \"BAD\" if it were not for their good information.  Now, I have to put myself on pause until I am within range of internet access ... .C.  Kaspersky - This is the only paid app on my THRiVEs.  It was available before Norton.  I wanted protection.  These folks are responsive to a user's thoughts, comments and feedback.D.  Adobe Reader - Just have to have my PDF's!  Enough written.20120420-Check the settings for a lot more tools that will be very useful.E.  Amazon Kindle -  Need I say more?F.  Google Docs, Google Earth, Google Maps, Google Translate, Google Voice, and Google Books - Each provides a glimps into the developer's Android creation.  Keep in mind that the Google developer's belief appears to be that the user would always have \"open\" internet connection no matter where they were or where they went.  \"Ain't happening yet!\"  However, the tools are worthwhile.G.  Adobe Flash Player - Yep, it works and does what it should.H.  Androidify -  Okay, so it is cute.  I liked it and fits my creative side when I am bored.I.  Barcode Scanner - The one by ZXing Team I like the best.  These folks are responsive to a user's thoughts, comments and feedback.J.  Centrury 21 Real Estate Mobile - The developer did a good job for the most part.  These folks are responsive to a user's thoughts, comments and feedback.K.  Cracker Barrel - It is food that meets my picky needs.L.  ERA Mobile Real Estate - (see J.)M.  Finance -  A Google tool.  Weird that it only completely works on one THRiVE.  I have hopes they will tell me where to find the corrupt data and how to delete.20120420-There has yet to be a response on this from Google.N.  FlightAware Flight Tracker - This is good if you have to sit in an airport wondering where in the world and what is happening to the expected flight (also good for people collecting passengers from baggage claim and even better most other information that might be useful).O.  MyQR Code - You will understand once you acquire this one (see I.)P.  My Tracks - If the THRiVE can get a GPS signal, the track across the ground/highway/trail will be shown - map and terrain is optional because the developers forgot that internet connection is not pervasive.Q.  Kayak - Ah, I just love the multiple cities option and all the better \"traveler\" places to search for hotel, car, and plane reservations.  These folks are responsive to a user's thoughts, comments and feedback.R.  WeatherBug - Get the version for Honeycomb.  These folks are responsive to a user's thoughts, comments and feedback.S.  USA TODAY for Tablet - I am still looking.  It fills the gap for now.T.  Norton Snap QR Code Reader, Norton Anti-Theft Plugin, Mobile Utilities & Task Killer, and Mobile Security and Antivirus - Keep in mind that some of these offer the complete set of advertised options for an additional subscription fee.  They serve a purpose for me just as they are, for now!U.  20120420 - Additional apps that might be of interest:  BASIC!, Firefox Beta, Google Googles (careful!), Google Sky Map.  Then there is Sketch n Draw that has advertisement; however, just go into \"airplane mode\" to mitigate and enjoy.ANDROID APPS (Of no use or ... )ZZ1.  Adobe Photoshop Express - it is a social media tool that does not allow me to do what I want.  If social media web sites are used, it might be okay?BAD AppsZZ2.  Videos - It is a Google app.  It cannot be uninstalled.  It just arrived a day or so ago.  Even though I might like it (?), Google gives me no choice in the matter and appears to think everyone should have this.  I suppose it is in the fine print, somewhere, so ... .20120420 - Google+ became the user environment that added a lot of features of absolutely no interest to me.  It was a disappointment that Google just did this, ... again, its probably in the fine print ... .  Then, there is also Google Play Books.

The Thrive is IMHO THE BEST TABLET AVAILABLE, including all other choices - Androids, iOS(Apple iPad), webOS(HP), etc. For me, the things that set it apart from ALL other tablets are its solid construction,  great design, and all it's connections/ports (removable battery, full size HDMI port, full size USB 2.0 and a mini USB port. You can take your SDXC/SDHC card right out of your camera and plug it in to the Thrive.  And Toshiba provides a great set of accessories if you want even more connections - like a dock, additional batteries - swappable without tools, just a lock on the back of the tablet.  Try that on an iPad!  The display is outstanding, it beats the iPad. The touch screen response is great. I get true multi-tasking with the Tegra dual-core processor, plus HARDWARE ACCELERATED  Adobe Flash and high quality gaming powered by NVIDIA GeForce.  The rubber and ribbed back make it really easy to hold, and it wont slide around on a hard surface like those rounded backed tablets. A tablet should be an integral part of your home network and this tablet offers more inter-operabilty with everything else I have.  For me,it is inter-operable with my HTC Incredible Phone, My Windows7 and Linux PCs, my Multimedia systems - TVs and Home Theater. I also added a Verizon MiFi 3G to my Thrive carry-bag, so my thrive has a 3g connection, so i can even THRIVE in my car while I am waiting for my wife to finish her shopping.Toshiba Thrive 10.1-Inch 32 GB Android Tablet AT105-T1032 BlackI went with the 32gb model, but with an SD slot and all these connections, the 16GB model is also a great choice at under $500. To get equivalent capabilities with an iPad I would have had to add a lot of accessory connectors and additional devices.  And I would still not get the flexibility Android offers.", "Date": "July 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Thrive has arrived!", "Author": "B. Hines \"bwebmasta\"", "ReviewID": "RX2DMZ0I7P0KV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Toshiba Thrive has introduced something no other pad on the market has: expansion on ALL ports, and a user replaceable battery. These areas along make the tablet stand out, but..how does it stack up to competition and daily use?DisclaimerI have tested and played around with all the other tablets on the market in the \"10 inch\" class such as the Samsung Tab, Asus Transformer, iPad2, Zoom, and the Acer Iconia.User ExperienceFrom a holistic standpoint, the Thrive is a very user friendly device, responsive, and versatile. As with Droid based devices, the screens are customizable with many widgets to choose from and of course that can be downloaded. The Thrive with it's rubber back feels very solid and well built. Sidenote: I have to admit; the Samsung Tab felt more like a wafer and was very slick. I did not feel very comfortable with it, is respect to that area.ScreenThe screen on the Thrive is capacitive, and at a 1280 resolution it is very vibrant and crisp. I know that some users complain about the brightness, but you can adjust the auto bright to suit whatever settings you like. I would suggest getting a screen cover as the screen does pickup fingerprints. The response time is amazing on this device, and the sensitivity is spot on.Battery LifeThe battery life on the Thrive has so far been about 7-8 hours with normal to heavy use. Light use, I have been able to leave the Thrive off the charger for a 24 hour period. Keep in mind, battery life goes according to what settings you have configured. For example, with the screen on full brightness, the battery will go down quicker. Apply some common sense in this regard. One of the shining points, is of course you can change the battery yourself in about 5 minutes flat.AppsI have been able to install apps and widgets that would suit just about anyone's needs. Apps are available anywhere from DirecTV to Fruit Ninja, to Quickoffice and back to Angry Birds. The Thrive has 2 different app stores, one for the Android market, and Toshiba. I have seen some reviews with complaints about that, just wanted to note it. True enough, there are some apps that are not available just yet such as Hulu and Netflix but those are not a deal-breaker to me. I use the tablet for fun and business use and it suits quite well with apps loaded and ones that are available.EmailI can look at GMail, pop, and exchange based email without any issues. Real short and quick in this area, seems some question about the different email functionality.PhysicsThe Thrive is a full 10.1 screen size, and the bezel actually makes it feel better with a little more width on the screen size. The weight at 1.6 lbs is still light, a mere 3 ounces more than the Samsung and many other pads on the market. The width, which some are making a big deal of, is just .6 inches. Just over half an inch...some people will just find anything to whine about. Overall, the Thrive is a solid built tablet, and is more rugged than most tablets on the market. If the additional 3 ounces is acceptable, this is the tablet for you.PortsThe ports. The almighty ports, full and mini usb, full HDMI, and full SD? What more can you ask for? The ports is what sets this tablet apart, the options are where it's at. The Thrive can accept hard drives, usb keys, keyboards, mice, printers which is amazing. One note though, your drives must be in FAT, FAT32, and exFAT format currently. NTFS is not supported just yet. The beauty is, you can have your files in the cloud or full control on the tablet with your own devices. Pictures on your SD go right from the camera to the tablet. Music, etc., great. The file manager is awesome. I know some may say this is not important, but it is vital to me. Oh to add, no adapters or strings attached. Excellent addition, Toshiba!In closing, the Thrive is an awesome device and brings a cumulative package of uses with it. On the hard disk size, you have to make that determination, I went with the 32GB. Remember, part of the disk space is used by the OS and Apps. Initially, I bought the 16GB, but after checking, only 12GB of space was left for use, so keep this in mind. I have not had any issues with my Thrive, but make sure to update your tablet when you get it and HARD REBOOT it after the updates. This is very important, and it does resolve the sleep issue. If you want a device with full expansion, and customization that can meet entertainment and business needs the Thrive does it.***Update 12.18.11*** I am still going strong on the Thrive, great tablet. Toshiba has released 3.2 for the Thrive, which fixed several things, which includes being able to read NTFS formats on SD and USB. So be sure to keep your tablet updated.", "Date": "August 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fine Product", "Author": "Skyhound", "ReviewID": "R3E7K7ZJA7JSM7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Toshiba Thrive 10.1-Inch 16 GB Android Tablet AT105-T1016My NEEDS AND SEARCHI have wanted a tablet since late last fall when I realized that I could really use something with this form factor. I have two primary needs. Around the house I wanted to be able to sit on the couch while watching TV or out on my deck and browse the web, read email, etc. My other use is on trips. I don't travel often enough to warrant the cost of a data plan for a mobile phone, and phones are tiny and difficult to use anyhow. I wanted something I could use comfortably on a plane or in a hotel room to stay connected. A tablet is perfect for these things.My search began with the iPad, but I am not an Apple fan because the way they control everything. The iPad is great for impressing people, but I wanted a tool. The iPad is single-tasking and works like a large phone. What I was looking for was more of a small laptop. I considered the Xoom very seriously, but they released it before it was ready so I held off. The Transformer looked great, but the many complaints about build quality kept me away. The Samsung 10.1 looked good too, but by then I realized that I wanted full sized ports and it came to my attention than none of these had user-replaceable batteries. The HP looks nice but I was turned off by the proprietary OS. I think Android is more likely to grow and have more apps available. It was a long wait, but in the end the Thrive was the first tablet that I felt comfortable buying.I have had the 16GB Thrive for two weeks now.SIZE, WEIGHT AND FEELI was very concerned about the weight of the Thrive. So I got two books, one the same weight of the Thrive and one the weight of the Samsung and I carried them around with me. What I discovered is that both tablets are too heavy to hold in one hand for a long time. For general carrying around or placement in the lap, the difference in weight didn't matter. If you buy the Toshiba case for you will feel that it is very well protected. But the unit+case is also heavy and bulky. It;s like carrying a textbook around. I find that I leave the case on the table and plop the unit into it while eating or when I don't have both hands available. But most of the time I leave it out of the case. This makes it seem small and lightweight in comparison. I find the wide edges to be a plus when holding it and my left thumb is well aligned with the \"Back\" button, which is the most often used control. The grooved back gives me a sense of security; I feel that I am not going to drop it.ANDROID OSAndroid is actually very nice. I takes some getting used to that you never close anything. But most \"open\" programs don't really stay open in the background; they are saved and then re-opened in the same state as before. This is clever and works quickly and seamlessly. I have found that the primary apps I need are there. I wish Skype supported video calling, but that is in the works. I like being able to customize the wallpaper and move shortcuts and widgets around. It does not appear that there is a way to uninstall the pre-installed apps. But this is only a minor annoyance except for the most control oriented. You can delete the shortcuts. I like the widget capability and the images for instant access to bookmarks.APPSThere are some really good news apps: Pulse and News360. I tried LogMeIn to access my Windows 7 desktop but it is very awkward to use. This could be a life saver on the road if I needed a file from my computer though. Google Maps and Google Earth work well. There are utilities available to display the GPS data and nearby Wi-fi. I can play my MP3s from the Amazon cloud drive and they sound very good in headphones. There is a version of Adobe Reader. The Movies app works great for researching nearby movies and theaters.CAMERASThe front facing camera works ok outdoors in in very well lighted locations. It doesn't replace a camera though. Indoors the picture quality is poor and there is a very long shutter lag. But if I didn't have my camera around and had the Thrive available it could be very handy.The rear-facing camera works ok for video calls via Google, but as with all tablets it suffers badly from the camera angle while holding it. It often looks like you are filming yourself from a camera located in your crotch! Holding it close for a full-face shot is difficult because of the parallax from the camera, which is located on the side (or top).BUILD QUALITYThe thinner tablets tend to flex a bit, but this one feels solid. I have had no concerns or problems.SCREENIt is important to know that the Thrive ships with an auto-brightness feature that is on by default. The screen doesn't jump out at you with lots of contrast when this is enabled. But it is easily disabled, and then the screen looks just as bright and nice as all the others. They all use pretty much the same technology after all. But I find that when enabled the battery life is greatly extended, so I turned it back on. It may not impress passers-by this way, but it is just as functional. The screen really shows the fingerprints after a while. But I solved this easily by applying a screen protector (military shield).16 GB STORAGEI was concerned that 16 GB wouldn't be enough, but I have installed tons of apps and barely filled it.PORTS AND SDI doubled my storage with a fast 16GB SD card. It just works. As far as I know you can't install apps on it, but it works well for media. The card does protrude just a bit from the top/side, but it is in an area where you don't generally have your hand.I connected an HDMI cable to my 46\" HDTV and then watched a home movie from a USB drive attached to the Thrive. I transferred the movie to the USB from my Windows 7 desktop. Worked fine. The HDMI is the same resolution as the screen, so it is not 1080p. I even played a few games connected to the TV.OVERALL PERFORMANCEI have not found myself wishing it were faster, with one exception. It does take 20-30 seconds to boot up. I don't know how this compares to other tablets. If just sleeping, it awakens instantly. Browsing with Chrome can sometimes be a little slow for complex pages. If the unit is running slowly overall, it can always be traced to having too many tabs open in the Browser which is running in the background. Video display well from the web and YouTube, as do my own movies.PROBLEMSI have used the Thrive for an average of about 4 hours per day. I have experienced the sleep problem once (I am running the latest update as of July 19). I had to hold the power button down for about ten seconds to make it reboot. I have had a few apps shut down, but not very often. Other than the one sleep issue I have never had the unit reboot or need to force a reboot.BATTERYAfter six hours of use I usually have about a quarter of the battery left. I have yet to use it for so long that I ran out of power. Easily recharged overnight. Leaving the auto-brightness enabled increases the battery life.PREINSTALLED SOFTWAREThe File Manager is a very nice feature and works well. Using the \"Market\" to download apps is simple and straight forward. The Chrome browser is sometimes slow, particularly when typing.ADDITIONAL HARDWAREThe built-in GPS, compass, and other sensors seem to work as they should. Not all tablets come with the full suite of hardware inside, so that is another plus for the Thrive.EXTERNAL SWITCHESThe power and volume switches are too difficult to find by touch alone. The volume is particularly annoying. I find that I often have to tip the unit up to find where to press, and being close to the power there is some concern I will get that by mistake, but so far this has yet to actually happen. The volume adjusts too quickly for my taste.SOUNDThe speakers are small and the sound a bit tinny as with all mobile devices, though they seem better than many after you adjust the equalizer. Sounds great in headphones.SUMMARYThe Thrive does what I needed it to do and overall I am very happy with it. It has been fun to use, with only a few annoyances along the way. I am very satisfied with my purchase. No regrets. I'd have given it five stars but I feel that should be for only the very best of the best and all tablets are in their infancy today.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Why the Toshiba Thrive is sooo much better than the Apple IPAD 2", "Author": "M.

New Android 3.1, Honeycomb Operating System awesome!  What Toshiba has added such as the Toshiba Media Player, just add to the wonderfulness.I have had the IPAD 2 since the beginning of September and liked it at first..... then the limitations just blew me away!-Example when emailing with the IPAD 2, I cannot attach files from different locations.  Instead I have to open the app, choose my document or picture and then email it from there.  If I have more than one attachment, I have to send separate emails for each!  This is just silly!-With the Thrive I open my email, be it gmail or outlook or any other acct. that I may have created, compose an email and click on attach and voila!  I have access to most of the folders in my Thrive.  So instead of opening each program, I open the folder where my document or picture is and attach.  I can do this numerous times using the same email that I am composing!  Wonderful!!!!-Another limitation with the IPAD 2 is the keyboard.  I can only use the IPAD keyboard.  If I want to convert handwriting to text, I have to buy an app such as Phat Pad, use the handwriting to text capability, then copy and paste into a word document or email.  You can use speech to text with the Dragon app but again.....  you have to copy and paste into the program that you want it in.  Again this is just silly!-With the Thrive I can download an app such as the Tflex-9, which uses all of the following:  - handwriting to text - Dragon speech to text - and a keyboard that has slide capability for selecting numbers or other symbols.  This will work in all the programs that I open in the Thrive.  I do not have to copy and paste.  Another cool keyboard is the Thumb Keyboard which splits the keyboard so that your fingers don't have to stretch to the middle of the tablet and it also has arrow keys that are sometimes just so much more convenient then selecting with your finger.-The Thrive does not have Netflix yet but it does have ADOBE FLASH support unlike the IPAD 2.  How irritating is that!  Especially when you go to the news sites on the web and you want to watch a news video.... OOPS.... YOU CAN'T DO THAT WITH THE IPAD!!!!.-I could go on and on.  I find the features on the HONEYCOMB OPERATING SYSTEM, once you discover them all, because there are many, just so much more convenient than the IPAD 2.  Not to mention what TOSHIBA  has added to the mix.-Oh! But wait, I almost forgot about Ports & Expansions - HDMI port (full-sized) for 720p video output - 2 USB ports (1 full-sized, 1 mini-USB) - Dock connector port  and - Secure Digital (SD) card slot, compatible with SD, SDHC, and SDXC media.  You can download documents with a thumb drive, as well as pictures.  You can transfer your music or back up the music you have purchased onto the thumb drive.  I mean, really.... How convenient is that!-My husband, who also has an IPAD 2,  bought the Camera Connection Kit and when he plugged the SD card from his camera into it, the IPAD indicated that there were no pictures on it!  So what is the purpose?  What a waste.  It may have been defective, but why should we have to buy so many accessories!-My husband and I have been so frustrated with our IPAD 2s that we finally broke down and invested in the TOSHIBA THRIVE.  The price was great and the case we got for it was very reasonable and fits quite well without adding tons of weight. (BLUREX Leather ULTRA-SLIM folio Case With convertible StandWhat more can I say.

Don't have a smart phone - think the surfing and apps are cool, but that screen is just too small for my middle-aged eyes.What I wantedI was looking for a tablet pc for three main things - surf the web, serve as an e-reader and that had a real USB port that I could use to download and backup photos from my old digital SLR camera. Note the camera uses compact flash memory, not micro SD, so I can't use that to transfer the photos.  I had previously bought and returned the eLocity A7 Android tablet because I couldn't get it to do the things I wanted.  Don't like the whole concept of the controlled Apple world plus the IPAD lacks a real USB port though you can get an adapter.OverallI've been very happy with the Thrive.  The screen looks great and the touch features work smoothly.  It's a little heavier than some others, but I generally rest it on my lap so that's not an issue.  Haven't had the dreaded not waking from sleep issue.  The file manager that's included is straightforward and easy to use.  I was able plug in my camera and copy files with no problems.  Also, I added 32 GB more memory using a standard card, which can be swapped out if necessary.  There aren't a huge number of apps yet, but they include enough to make it immediately useful and the number is growing.Minor annoyancesAs others have mentioned, the on/off button is inconvenient to find, especially in low light.You can't close apps without turning off the tablet - though this may be a function of Honeycomb.You can't delete the included programs, but really they don't take up much space.It doesn't come with any directions except a small startup pamphlet.  Typical, I know, but would it hurt them to include a pdf on the tablet with more details?  FYI, here is a link to an Android 3 manual [...]Here's a link to the Thrive manual  [...]AppsComes with a fine file manager and browser.  There is also a gallery program to review photos and a bunch of solitaire type games.  The maps app is really great - it works with the gps system so you don't have to be in wifi range to use it.  It also can be used to get directions or look for restaurants etc near you.I have so far downloaded Kindle and Aldiko book readers which both work fine.  Also got a free photoshop lite program to do simple photo editing.  And I'm afraid I'm already addicted to Crazy Birds.There is a list of optimized to Honeycomb programs here[...]Sadly, Netflix doesn't yet work, but hopefully will soon.Bottom LineI've had the Thrive for a couple of weeks and it can already do all the things I was looking for and more.

Gutierrez", "ReviewID": "R2R1HXVO5NI866", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After about a month of research, comparing $270-$600 tablets (iPad2, Acer A500, MSI Windpad, Coby Kyros 1024) and $800 17\" Core i7 laptops, I decided on the Thrive as a mobile solution based on all the reviews I have read on Amazon despite the fact I am totally new to Android.  It's the only unit I couldn't demo among my list.  I definitely like the rubberized back compared to the Acer's aluminum backing.  The Thrive feels like it is more durable and scratch resistant than the Acer.  I don't think it is heavy at all, it is thicker, but I like it that way.  iPad feels too thin that I might bend it or forget I am holding it because it is too light.  The Kyros I tried, had too few reviews online, I figured there might be too little community support.  The Windpad the was most expensive, it didn't really feel right to me.The good news was that the Thrive worked perfectly right out of the box (I did not update the OS by the way).  I have installed through the \"market\" icon a number of free games/apps (Angry Birds), Webster Dictionary.  I also installed Documents to Go 3, OfficeSuite Pro, QuickOffice, and sad to say none of them can display correctly any powerpoint animations I made on MS Office 2007.  Maybe I am not using them right.I bought a few accessories like a tablet stand from connectland for about $9.  It allows me to tilt the tablet the way you would a laptop screen.  Crude, but it works.  I connected a keyboard and a mouse through a USB Hub, works fine, a mouse pointer appeared on the tablet.  I installed a FAT32 formatted 16GB SD card, the tablet found its contents immediately through the \"file manager\" icon.I did have a hard time making it talk via Wi-Fi to my Linksys WRT54G Router.  If you have the same router, try these settings to save you the trial and error:SSID Broadcast - enabled, Security Mode - WPA2 Personal, WPA Algorithms - TKIP+AES, WPA Shared Key - \"your password\", MAC Filtering - enabled (you can find the Thrive MAC in settings/about tablet/status).  On the Thrive, goto settings/wireless networks/add Wi-Fi network.I have also tried the voice input, cool.  If you click on the mic icon on the browser, and say \"google.com\", well, the browser will take you to google.com without typing it.  Did I mention I am completely new to Android?  It didn't take me that long to figure out the interface.  I like it!Some people have been complaining about the tablet not waking up, I don't have that problem.  When the tablet goes to sleep (default is about 2 minutes), you wake it up by pressing the power button a few seconds, it won't wake up by tapping the screen, but it seems it will wake up through the USB keyboard after a few keystrokes.Bottom line, I believe I made the right choice, I am happy with the purchase.  Even my sister who owns an iPad2 thinks the Thrive is a better tablet.", "Date": "July 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "My 2 cents is - superb tablet, here's why...", "Author": "Bron \"Bron\"", "ReviewID": "R72DVB7J97PAY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OK, so I won't rehash here all the stuff you can read in the other reviews, I'll just give you my impressions after my hands on with my new Thrive.  Note that I also own an iPad (32 GB 3G/Wifi) and several other smaller android devices and e-readers, netbooks, etc.; so I have some comparisons to judge by.Let's cut to the chase, I love the Thrive.  Up and running in 5 minutes flat (or less).  And after about 5 hours of fooling with it, it's everything I hoped it would be and meets my expectations in full.  Now time will tell, but at this point, I am thrilled.  It's comparable in size and weight to my iPad, I notice little difference as far as weight or thickness, indeed, I like the Thrive's grippy rubber backing.  No need to buy one (rubber backing/case) like I had to do with my iPad.In comparing the screens, I also see little difference as far as sharpness, color, viewing angles, and so on.  I do like the iPad's format better.  For a tablet, the added width in the vertical orientation seems like a plus to me.  That said, I did not notice any issues while using the Thrive, though I do prefer using it in landscape orientation for most things.  Some apps make vertical a better choice, of course.  So, to me, the Thrive is every bit in the same league as the iPad.  Personally, I prefer the thicker, sturdy format, that's why I bought my iPad when iPad 2 came out.  I wanted the iPad, not the iPad 2.  For same reason, I did not like the Galaxy.  Just personal preference, of course.Why did I get a Thrive then?  Because I chafe under the \"Apple Prison\" and restrictions of the iPad.  While having control does have some advantages, for someone like me who likes flexibility, it's a losing proposition.  No standard ports?  No easy way to load and play all my various video formats, iTunes is fine, but irks me sometimes.So when I saw the Thrive with Bluetooth (a must for me), 2 full USB ports, full SD card, and a full HDMI port, plus the File Manager and easy ways to share and deal with files (i.e. like every other darn device does except the iPad!), it caught my attention.  A lot of research and a shot at a discount off an already good price and -- sold!Out of the box, everything has worked fine and it's even better than I had hoped.  The screen seems great, decent black levels (important to me), and it is extremely easy to use.  With limited previous Android experience, I find 3.1 to be a great OS, very intuitive.  I have been able to figure out everything and personally feel it is easier to use than the iPad in many ways.  Very happy with it.  The speakers have very good stereo separation, thought they are definitely treble oriented (like every other tablet).  What do you expect from tiny speakers?  Still, I had no trouble watching YouTube vids.  For better sound, I fired up one of my portable bluetooth stereo speakers and they paired easily and worked great.  Much better bass and mid-range.  Headphones sound great as well.  As does my ZVOX audio system via my Bluetooth receiver there.  So good sound is not an issue.  (Tried it this with Creative Labs blutooth speaker system and it works well and sounds fantastic: Creative ZiiSound D3x Modular Wireless Speaker System (51MF8120AA002))As I said, even using the auto-brightness, I find the screen quite good and see no issues with it.  The buttons all work great.  I had no problems locating and using the power button as some have mentioned.  Heck, it's right between the battery and WiFi LEDs, so not hard to locate.  Much easier to use than the power button on the ipad in my opinion.  Having the orientation lock is a nice feature. Just ask all the ipad users when Apple messed with that on the iPad. ;)So, absolutely great design.  This is the power user's tablet, yet so easy to use, I think anyone would like it. Very snappy performance...as good or better than iPad.  Battery life seems fine to me.  No trouble getting 7-8 hours or more without trying.  Good enough for me.  I'm sure with a little effort I could get 10 or better.  Basically, you can use this all day long under normal circumstances.  Charges very quickly as many have noted. Swappable batteries, so no issues there.  The ipad is awesome with 12-14 hours easily.)I can run my Amazon Cloud player on it, as well as Pandora and many other music apps.  Nice!  Covers that.  Mobo app will play about any video.  Included YouTube app plays YouTube HD videos well and they look super.  Built-in apps good enough for most things, especially audio.  Maps app works very well.  Looks superb on this nice screen.  Again, as good as iPad in my opinion.  Web browsing works very well, superior to iPad in all respects.  Performance, plus flash, and ease of use.  Not a huge deal, but nice since that's a major use for me.And just so well designed and easy to use.  I keep coming back to that because that's what kept jumping out to me as I explored the Thrive.  I have yet to do any updates and everything is working great.  I might not even update for awhile as I'm not sure I need to at this point.  It's working fine for everything and I have not had any issues so far (of course, I have only used it for 5 or 6 hours, so need more time really.  I may just wait for 3.2 to be released.  (2011-11-19 Have now done one update, no major changes, everything still works fine. Just some minor tweaks.)Having the full size SD card was another big feature for me.  I just popped in a 32 GB SDHC card with a ton of my mp3's on it and everything works as expected.  Being able to back up data to your Google account and the SD card, a USB stick, or hard drive is a definite plus as well.I've had good luck with Toshiba products over the years and this will, hopefully, be no exception.  Well designed and well built.  As I get more time with it, I will come back and update this review if anything significant develops. (2011-11-19 -- 3 months and still loving it.)I like the iPad a lot, but feel the Thrive is every bit the equal, and is even better in many respects.  Much greater connectivity and flexibility and that's very important as it means there's a lot more things you'll be able to do with your Thrive.  By the way, the included NFS Shift game demo worked great and looked good.This baby has the right mix of features for me and is a great value.  So, kudos Toshiba!  The Thrive is a winner!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*** 2011-11-04 update:  This wireless touchpad/keyboard device works with the Thrive: Wireless Ultra-mini Touchpad Keyboard (VP6364) -- I have both and this unit was truly \"plug and play\" (see my review on the prod page) and everything worked as expected, touchpad, mouse buttons, keyboard, media keys, etc. all worked fine.  Not something most people will need, but thought a few might benefit from knowing this.  If you are a fearsome thumber, you might like it.  I like it mainly for the media controls (play/pause., vol up/down, prev/next song, and so on).*** 2011-11-19 Have had my Thrive about 3 months now and I remain very satisfied with it.  No issues, works well, using it more all the time.  Gmail works great, better than on my laptop. GPS, maps and navigation work very well.  Battery holds its charge and lasts a long time.  Video, Music, Browsing are all fine, so I would still recommend this as a good choice if you like the feature mix (which I do).  I got this leather case with flap/stand which works well for me and is cheap: Poetic Slimbook Leather Case for Toshiba Thrive 10.1-Inch Android Tablet, Black**** 2012-03-10 update:  Many tablets come, many go.  I remain very happy with my thrive.  ;)----P.S.  Haven't mentioned the cameras.  That's because I see no real use for them and have not bothered to play with them.  They could leave them off and cut the price as far as I am concerned.  I have really good cameras and video cams if I need video or photos.  Don't need my tablet for that.  (OK, the cams work fine for occasional use.)But I do need the GPS!  That's a nice plus I didn't mention above.  (GPS works great!)P.P.S.  About the apps advantage iPad has.  Yes, many hundreds of thousands more apps.  But I only need about 12 or so.  Feel sure Android apps will continue to grow and I'll have what I need.  iPad has almost too many choices. ;)", "Date": "August 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Geek tablet user review", "Author": "Eric Laffoon \"ubergeek\"", "ReviewID": "R23FCURG0QD3VB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've actually been using Android and Android tablets a while, since the first Archos Android tablet (gen 7) in 2009 and I have their 7 and 10 inch Froyo tablets. Archos has announced new tablets for September with Honeycomb and I will most likely be buying at least one, for reasons that will be apparent. I was going to order the 8 GB but found the 16 GB in stock at Best Buy no waiting.My other tablets seemed fast when I got them, and now seemed not so fast. I wanted to try Honeycomb and also develop software on it. Initially I thought the Galaxy Tab would be the thing to have, but no SD? Come on?  The Transformer and Iconia also looked interesting. The Xoom was too spendy for something I'd want to replace by next year when the really fast tablets come out, and SD card not working... Seriously. While I was thinking of the Transformer I saw the Thrive. Simple. Full size SDXC, 'nuff said! Full size ports are nice but the replaceable battery is also nice. After my Archos experience I'm not overly impressed with the battery, but the charge time of about an hour is fast.First off Honeycomb takes a little getting used to, but it's really addictive and slick. As a Linux user the USB MTP choice seemed initially obtuse as I always use USB mass storage, but it seems there are reasons. Keep in mind if you run Linux file transfers require either getting mtpfs working, using adb or some other option. Media playing offers Toshiba enhancements but suffers various issues. First up is the Tegra II decode limitations. It will play formats listed here, if everything is encoded the way it likes. This is where Archos shines and why their next tablet with an TI OMAP 4460 will really make Tegra II devices look silly. Thankfully you can use Mobo for software decoding and while some people say it isn't smooth my experience has been great with mobo playing my videos. The audio sounds great for clarity and quality but the speakers lack bass and are tinny. With this much body space they could have put a mini subwoofer in there. I've seen good and bad said about the screen, but my opinion is the screen is great with amazing viewing angles and clarity. However if you leave it in auto it seems a little dim.Problems so far have been with UPnP and sharing files with my PC. In fairness I'm not sure how much is the Thrive as I seem to have odd things going on with my Pogoplug UPnP and am trying to get Samba working right on my Linux box. I have had some wake up problems where I had to reboot a few times. Over all it has been absolutely delightful. The cameras are not great, as mentioned by others, but I have a nice camera I can plug in and use this for a viewer.The real strong point of this tablet has to be the web browsing. Sure there isn't a Netflix Honeycomb app, and I'd love to see streaming on Tegra devices, but I opened the browser and and managed my queue easily. That would really choke up my single core tablet. The other thing is that this is the first device that is faster than my Galaxy S phone that I can show people things with in a fast paced environment without waiting. The photo features for viewing and editing are first class and I haven't even tried the movie maker yet.This is not the thinnest or the lightest tablet, but you can buy an 8 GB unit cheap and then add 128 GB SDXC later and carry a 256 GB USB stick for a lot of video to go. As development continues it and more software arrives this tablet is only going to get better.", "Date": "July 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Toshiba Quality - Screen", "Author": "E.

In fact, I found a spreadsheet someone did that added another dozen or so tablets, including the HP, etc.Why did I pick the Toshiba? Primarily? Usability. I realized something about my own use of products that is actually true for most people, though only visionaries like Steve Jobs take it to the limit.The easier something is to use, the more likely you are to use it.If you don't need to find Adapter A (say, mini HDMI) to plug into Adapter B (the actual full-sized HDMI cable you have) to plug your tablet into your TV, the more likely you are to USE the HDMI functionality. Want a keyboard? You can take the one you plug into your PC and plug it into your tablet. Yes, ANY keyboard, not a wireless one, not bluetooth, just a keyboard. ANY thumbdrive becomes an expansion drive.This is huge. The iPad has NO (as in Zero) normal ports. Neither does the (very pretty to look at) Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 (which is so nice that Apple is suing Samsung to keep their tablets out of the country). Everything has to be done wirelessly or through an adapter for other adapters.Price is competitive. On several levels - both with the overall unit, and you can use regular SD cards, which almost none of the others can use. This RAM is cheaper. You can use regular HDMI and regular USB - again, cheaper to acquire and use.Feel is solid - my kids have dropped this thing onto a hard surface floor several times - still works great. The rubberized back prevents slippage and dropping. I like the black border around the screen, as it gives you a place to hold the screen w/out smudging your viewable area.I could go on, but I really wanted to address one last thing that I have found people complain about this particular model.__________________________________________________________________________________-The screen!!Look, it's vibrant but people complain about the smudging. However, if you get the Toshiba screen protector (I usually hate screen protectors!) I found it all but eliminated the problem completely. It also works great to protect your screen against scratching.I love this tablet. I've had it now for over a month and it lives up to everything I'd hoped it would. The graphics are better than the iPad, the cost is a LOT less, and the full-sized ports makes this thing so dang usable.Update: 11/30/2011The kids are using it (as in three of them) watching Tangled on Netflix. Again with the usability! I had some pretty cheap computer speakers kicking around and it sounds great, and the over 10\" screen is keeping a 2 year old, six year old and 10 year old happy as clams. And it streams over Wi-Fi darn near magically. I love this tablet and I haven't used my 4 month old laptop since I got it!

On the road I tether it to my Android phone and it becomes a great GPS device, music player and for most things, a replacement for my laptop.  Granted, if you are technically challened, there are things that I have done to improve my Thrive's performance that you might not be comfortable with.  For me, the ability to customize my Thrive is a true selling point and the reason I purchased it. The tremendous amount of online help in forums and blogs is great.  I will admit that the IPAD is a wonderful device...but for me, the ability to customize is paramount and the what you see is what you get IPAD just doesn't work for me.The speed, touchscreen, audio and video performance are great.  You Tube works perfectly and Netflix runs like a charm.People that compare Android devices to Apple are missing the point.

I use a mini reader for micro-SD cards, so I don't have some huge flash drive hanging off the side.  I keep one microSD card for each of my engineering projects, and just switch it out as needed.  I keep music and video content on the full-size SD card.  I also use a 750 GB USB portable hard drive when I'm at at table or desk, but I did have to reformat the drive to get picked up by the tablet (still works with my desktop and laptop in the new format). The connectors are perfect for doing something more than Fruit Ninja (which, by the way, is also fun on the Thrive).  The screen resolution is fine for everything I do (1200x800), and performance is very good.  One of the other selling factors for me over the iPad and the Samsung products was the heft and feel of the unit.  I know it's just my imagination, but when I tried the thinner devices, it felt like all I was holding was the gorilla glass.  It felt like the unit would snap in two if I sneezed (again, I know those are quality products).  The rubberized back and \"gripability\" are reassuring on the commute, where even a netbook would be tough to open, much less use.

The tablet is now running very well. Now I am upgrading this review to five stars from  one star.The Toshiba tablet is a true multimedia tablet with lots of extras. It comes with a Tegra 2 dual-core processor, and has also been given an IPS display. Connectivity comes in the form of a full-fat HDMI port, USBs.Expandability is the best over both Samsung and Apple. USB, memory card, HDMI, screen orientation lock, long power supply cable, better docks and cases. Case is better in your hands with slip-proof grip. There are actually two cameras: a 5 megapixel on the back for snapping photos and videos and a 2 megapixel webcam on the front.Other Toshiba tablet featuresThe ports are tucked away neatly behind covers; with rounded edges and no sharp port edges, it's comfortable to hold. The volume and power buttons are flush with the edge of the case, but they're also big enough to find quickly with your fingers.The capacitive screen is responsive; swiping and pinch zoom gestures are fast and fluid. The back of the case has a rubberised coating and a distinct ridged pattern that makes it very easy to grip. It snaps off to give you access to the battery and Sim slot.  The 23Wh battery should give a reasonable run time, and it's replaceable so you can carry a spare if you really want. Slide the latches at the side and the large battery pops out so you can carry a spare or replace it if you're still using the tablet when the battery stops holding chargeYou can also change the back if you don't like the basic black colour scheme; Toshiba will offer replacement covers in five colours - Silver, Denim, Lime Green, Magenta and Amethyst.The haptic feedback allows  for easier typing. There's also an internal gyroscope and accelerometer for games that let you turn the screen like a steering wheel.We finally have a tablet for the consumer who refuses to be caged by Apple's drm jail, and who expects expandability an adaptability. Thank you Toshiba for keeping the intelligent and technologically literate consumer in mind.You may skip the next part of this review as Toshiba has addressed the wake issues. I changed the review from one star to five stars again.*Update:Thursday July 21, 2011*:Since receiving my Toshiba Thrive I have been experiencing a wake-up issue with the tablet. When the tablet goes to sleep for over 10 minutes it won't wake up and needs to be rebooted. I called tech support yesterday, and was told that no one had reported the problem. The problem persisted and I went on line to do research on the problem. I found numerous posts on the problem. One post claimed that the issue is with the Android operating system, but the other Android 3.1 tablets are not experiencing the same problem which raises questions and the possibility that it is a firmware issue, and thus one that can be addressed in the event Toshiba were more diligent. I called tech support today again and was told that they are working on the issue and they hope to resolve it soon. Tech support was courteous and efficient.Should a solution to this problem not be achieved soon, I will have to downgrade my rating to a 1 until the issue is resolved. I still think this tablet is a superior product to any other tablet in the market, in particular to any of Apple's iPads.*Update Feb 26, 2012Downloaded and installed the latest updates for the tablet and the suspend and a wake-up issue has subsided by about 95%. It still happens. Out of 20 suspend and wake-ups I subjected the tablet to, only one time did I have to reboot the tablet to get it going again.The included browser will simply crash when I try to open the website [...]  In the Opera browser, downloaded as a free app, I can open  seekingalpha but the page does not respond to any gestures, which suggests that the issue is with the included  browser and maybe with seekingalpha itself. I tried opening it with the firefox app as well, but had no success.In passing, let me add that those people who think that a tablet  is a substitute for their netbook or laptop are very very wrong. Navigating with a tablet, even with a mouse and keyboard is  cumbersome. A tablet is a device for quick access to the web. I see using my tablet as a device for reading news when on the treadmill at the gym, or reading at home or while commuting using public transportation here in NYC. The tablet has already proven itself useful for looking up a recipe while cooking. I could even use it while driving once I get a mobile hotspot service.*Update July 23, 2011Have been experiencing random reboots when in sleeping mode.I am planning to  return the table for a refund. I Simply can't believe that Toshiba would release this product without first testing it extensively. This is a product with great potential and if corrected, it would be the best tablet in the market. Unfortunately, I will have to wait until another tablet designed for  the more technologically literate users come into the market, or hopefully Toshiba does a firmware upgrade and I can repurchase this product.No, I will not use a table lacking connectivity or riddled with DRM caveats.  Even as I type this the device has done a random reboot. I am using my Netbook to post this. I am lowering the rating for Toshiba Thrive to the lowest  possible rating; should Toshiba solve this problem I will return the rating to a 5.Perhaps 6 months later:I have been using my Toshiba Thrive Table almost daily and remain quite pleased with it.  I recently got for it a Targus Bluetooth keyboard that allows me to type more efficiently. I use the tablet almost daily when I present my Calculus lectures.  Typically I hand-write them and then photograph them with the built in camera and  access them via the gallery application. It is indeed extraordinary to be able to carry so so many notes in such a compact device. Recently I got a leather folder for the tablet and feel quite pleased with it.Not too long I did have an accident; perhaps a month ago a small crack on the screen appeared and the crack expanded to a complete crack across the screen after perhaps a week. This is surprising since I have been extremely careful with the device and can't recall it falling. However, it is possible that because I was carrying a small tripod in my backpack the screen suffered pressure from it inadvertently  even though it was protected by the leather folder. The screen is extremely fragile and users should be exceedingly careful when transporting the device as the screen is made of glass. Apparently many people have had the same problem. I recently purchased a replacement screen and will be installing it when I receive it. There is a video at the following link for people that want to do the repair, but it is a tiny bit technical. The repair if done by Toshiba is about $300 USD, but you can buy the screen for about $150 dollars with the bevel included.  I feel like reducing my rating of this product as a result of the fragility of the screen, but think it more prudent to just say that the user be extremely careful and that getting a hard backed folder for it might be a good idea.Link to Toshiba Thrive Screen Replacement video:[...]", "Date": "July 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Bad customer support", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2I8SJLXLAQS2P", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have really enjoyed my Thrive since I purchased it in December 2011.

I had been shopping for a device to do school work away from the house. I have a laptop, but its horrid battery life means that its mobility is trumped by the need to be near a wall outlet for any extended use. I needed a device that could be charged in the morning and would run on that charge for the day. I choose a tablet over a net-book after reading a blog of a man who claimed he actually was more focused working on a tablet than he was on a pc.Now having used the Thrive for almost a month with the purchase of an Office App, and the Logitech Tablet Keyboard for Android 3.0+ (Keyboard-and-Stand Combo  920-003390). I can see why he made that statement. If you are not familiar with tablet devices, as I was not. It can be a shock. They do not multitask the way a pc does. This does focus my attention on one task at a time. But, it was a rude awakening. I get more done than before and with the exception of missing some of the tools and ribbons MS Office has, I am happy with the purchase. I choose the Thrive because of all the ports and its user replaceable battery. Popping the back off of the device is not as easy as I hoped it would be though and you feel as though you might break it when you are doing it. I keep telling myself it was meant to do this and that if it does break, backs are on sale at Best Buy. But despite my fears on the issue it does appear to hold up to the process.Now, as far as the android market... As of the time I am writing this review there are still a lot of things yet to be made available to Thrive consumers. For instance, Netflix can not be watched on a Thrive tablet yet. After seeing commercials of people watching TV/Movies on their tablets I must admit this was a big let down for me. They do expect that this will change though. I am noticing that my Android phone has a considerably larger number of app choices over the tablet. So not everything is available. But that works both ways. I have apps on my Thrive that my phone does not have access to.The last subject I am going to talk about is the actual battery life. I have not done extensive tests, but this is my observation. When I use the Thrives auto-brightness selector (it gets brighter in lighter areas darker in dark areas). And I am doing a normal amount of work. I can charge my Thrive over night and it will last me the entire school/work day. When I get home it only has 1/4 charge left. This is absent of watching movies on it. This is mostly using the Office app (white screen) and Google+ing. I could see this being an issue for people who may end up consuming more power than I do.Over all I really do love my Thrive. As my fellow classmates and friends have noted, \"It really has freed you from being tethered to the wall outlet.\" My demands are not complex or demanding on the processor. I have not experienced any crashes or resets. I use less than 20 apps. It fits very nicely in the satchel I have been carrying for the last year, so it does not require extra carrying capacity (for me). It does what I bought it for and very well at that. I do recommend getting a keyboard if you are planning on typing very much. The on screen keyboard is very accurate and possibly could be mastered eventually, but I find it slows me down too much.I have been recommending this product to all of my friends.", "Date": "September 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "16GB Toshiba Thrive - LOVE IT", "Author": "HBHoops \"Former Hard-Charger\"", "ReviewID": "R13XQQ6V65ZHGC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I started looking for tablets a while ago and when I really started getting serious about it, I started looking online.

I don't know what the other reviewers who could not get this thing up and running are talking about, but I can assure you that I did not have any issues.Upon first boot up, you will be prompted for setup. After this, you have the opportunity to connect the device to a wifi connection. I had configured my fiancee's phone as a permanent wifi-hotspot and this tablet has had no issues with maintaining connectivity. In fact, when it did lose connectivity the couple of times it did, it was because her phone was powered off. However, once it came back on and the wifi app was activated, the wifi would come immediately back on on the tablet. She's dealing with 3G speeds on the tablet, but for watching Netflix, some schoolwork, and of course games, it is more than adequate.In any event, after wifi connectivity was set, the first thing I did (which is what every Thrive owner should do) is to perform system updates. I had thought that I could update to Android 3.2 straightaway, however Toshiba updates are not cumulative; you have to perform Toshiba updates one at a time. It's not terribly a big deal, but I just thought you'd want to know that. However, from the reviews that I've read on this Toshiba tablet, Honeycomb 3.2 had fixed a lot of problems this tablet was having. Skype works wonderfully (albeit it was a bit jittery, but it worked) and Netflix when watching a video on the tablet works well too. However, when you attempt to watch Netflix through your TV, the 720p output is just awful. Movies look very pixelated. However, on the device itself, that pixelation doesn't exist. We watch Netflix via our Playstation 3 anyhow, so if there's a problem with the Playstation Network, the tablet will only be used \"In Case of Emergency\" only. However, when hooked up to the TV, the tablet itself looks very nice...very useful if you wanted to do presentations at the office or something.I would definitely recommend getting this Tablet if you want Internet, email, the occasional movie watching on the go, etc., studying, or anything else you would buy an Ipad for. The weight is heavier than the Galaxy Tab, to be sure, but it's not so much that you will break your back or anything. For the price (if you can buy one under $300), it is very reasonable and I can't really think of anything you can't do with the Toshiba Thrive.As for battery life, my fiancee has gone a whole day without charging it in the couple of days she's played with it. When not in use, she will just charge it and use it again the next day. I highly recommend this tablet for both the functionality and price (if under $300.)

The stereo speakers and SRS Sound Enhancement software that Toshiba incorporated is a nice addition, allowing the tablet to produce powerful sound that isn't dull or sound like its coming from a tin can. The only thing this tablet lacks is mobile broadband support, but with its full size USB 2.0 port, you could easily plug in a mobile broadband USB adapter from your wireless carrier of choice. A full size SD card slot allows you to upgrade your storage space easily, but more importantly, cheaply. The camera quality is decent, and the front facing camera is a great addition, but unfortunately isn't supported by most video chatting apps as of the time of this review. Overall, this tablet is a notch above the rest and gives the competition a run for its money.", "Date": "July 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Android 3.1 have 2 very annoying issues (FIXED, NOT really yet).

Especially the full size SD slot, USB and HDMI.* Wi-Fi was very easy to setup, it picked up my network, typed in my Pre-Shared Key and it logged in right away.* Wireless Speed: My Comcast speed is supposed to offer 12Mbps, testing wireless devices about 2 feet away from router, iPod's 802.11g is 9.82Mbps, hardwired desktops are 12.59Mbps, while this Thrive tablet's 802.11n is jamming at 23.66Mbps. Don't know why the tablet's wireless is way faster than my hardwired desktops.* With the built-in mic, the voice recognition seems fairly accurate, as long as you speak clearly and not super fast, kind of cool searching the net by talking, instead of typing.* Email is also easy to setup, just typed in my comcast email and password, and it was able prefill all other settings for me.* The textured back does make gripping easier.* Screen can be set to very bright and is very vibrant, with no light bleed.* The screen material seems to be as scratch resistance as the iPod, so I am not using any screen protectors.* Like the power, charging and Wi-Fi indicator lights.* Built-in GPS is cool, but you need Wifi to initially get directions, in-order for the Google Map turn by turn talking GPS to work. Most times it'll find a GPS within less than a couple of minutes, but sometime it just sits there searching.* Feels well built, does not flex anywhere, unlike the Asus Transformer (when you grab it from the thin edges, the plastic tends to flex).Cons/trade offs* Thicker and heavier that the competition, but it does not bother me, guess that's part of the trade off to have full size ports. Especially that I have it in the portfolio case, which makes it even thicker and heavier, but it makes me feel safer when my 4 yr old plays with it.* Back cover is a bit hard to get off.* Power and Volume buttons, have to really either get used to their locations or visually look to press at the right location. Especially the Power button, it's smooth and almost flushed with the side of the case, not raised much at all to allow easy and obvious feel of the button.* If you have it in the Toshiba Portfolio Case, it's almost impossible to open the cover to the USB, HDMI ports, I had to actually take it out of the case to open the cover.* It only supports MP4, so if you have old videos in other formats, most likely they are not supported and you will need to convert them first.* A lot of free apps display ads, sometimes those ads will lead to sites that are not appropriate for kids. The easy solution is to put the tablet into airplane mode while playing those apps, no more ads for anyone to accidentally click on.Andriod v3.1.01.5.0022 issuesTwo main issues that I have come across, which happens intermittently and somewhat often (I'm not the only one, do a Google search and you will find others talking about them on forums), Toshiba is stating that it is an Android issue and that Toshiba is working with Google to  release an update before the end of July 2011 to address the first issue. I'm not sure if they will try to address the second or not.* 1st issue - Standby(Toshiba/Google calls it Timeout), once it goes into timeout, the Power light will glow on and off. For me, typically not right away, it may take a short while, like several hours, I will noticed that the Power light is on steadily, it will not come out of timeout, I then have to power it down and restart, which happens quite frequently. When this happens, since the Power light is on steadily, but the screen is black, it's almost like the system has woken up from timeout on its own, but locked up.* 2nd issue - While plugged into the included AC adapter, after going into timeout mode, out of no where, the system will reboot itself. Since I've had the tablet, I've noticed that it happened 4 or 5 times, I'm sure it's done it more than that, it's just that I did not notice it or was not around at the time. But, it never happens when I'm actually using it, I always use it while unplugged.ConclusionThat's all of the Pros, Cons, and Android issues that I can think of right now. Until Toshiba and Google fixes the two main issues(timeout and reboot), the star rating will stay at 3. If it were not for those 2 issues, I would most likely give it a 4.5. This definitely will not replace a desktop or laptop. At least for me, it'll be more toward reading PDF, browsing the net, checking email, for my kid to play games with and whatever educational apps that I can find for him. If I have to do any serious work, back to my desktop I go.UPDATE 8/3/2011Regarding the sleep and not waking up issue, just updated with the new version of Android from Tosihba, only time can tell, will update again within a few days, to determine if the SOD has been completely fixed or not. Grrrrrr, has been very annoying!!!UPDATE 8/8/2011The sleep issue has been fixed by the update. Now hoping that their will be an update to allow caching of maps with Google Map, so that one does not need wifi to get directions.UPDATE 8/10/2011It's been working perfect after the update as of 8/3/2011. But, starting on 8/8/2011, the sleeping issue happened two days in a row, each time after sleeping overnight. Sending it back for an exchange. After the first update, I changed it to a 4 star, now back to a 3 star, Grrrrr!UPDATE - Right after 8/10/2011I returned the unit and got a brand new replacement from the reseller. The first thing I did was performed a system update with the replacement and since then, I never came across the sleep or rebooting issues again. The only other thing I am still waiting for, is the NetFlix app to stream movies, don't know if it will ever happen, a real bummer!!!UPDATE - 10/20/2011Noticed that Netflix was finally available on this tablet, now am very happy, helps pass the time while I'm on the elliptical machine to burn of those beer calories.UPDATE - 4/13/2013After updating from Honeycomb to Ice Cream Sandwich, the tablet crashes/locks up a lot more now, there is no easy way to roll back and Toshiba has no answer/fix for the update issues. Research carefully before updating your particular tablet to the new Android OS.

Had it for over a month, so ready to say, I love this thing.  I imagine most Tegra 2/Android 3 tablets would be about the same - the advantage here is the SD card slot, full size and mini USB, and HDMI port.  So, how often have I actually used them...or needed to?  I have used a PS3 controller to play Shadowgun and hooked the HDMI up just to check it out.  Both worked flawlessly with no effort on my part.  That was impressive - even Windows 7 has to hiccup and burp before it will agree to do that.  Android is definitely the best user experience on top of Linux that I've encountered.I'm really just reviewing to put in my thumbs up, given that others have had problems.  I believe Toshiba has worked out the shutdown problems - at least, I've never seen them.  The real question then is do you need a tablet and, if so, iPad or Android.  I find the tablet to be a wonderful companion computer.  I've used an iPad and I really can't see any difference between it and the Android.  The app you want may not be on the Android market yet - or perhaps vice versa.  I have been able to find everything I want, mostly for free - SAMBA client, DLNA client, MP4 AVC/AC3 video player with hardware acceleration.  I usually end up buying the apps just to support the makers.The gizmo is a great little video player, within reason.  Word is that the Tegra 2 does not actually do full HD, though i don't think you need full HD on a device this small.  However, that would be a sticking point, as the Tegra 3 is quite a bit more powerful, and the iPad 3 will be as well.", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Most Functional Tablet", "Author": "Ramzi \"Ramzi\"", "ReviewID": "R3FK0D80SIOZ1T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I should mention that I have used or extensively tested all major brands with the exception of the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10 inches, but including the first Samsung Tab 7 inches.Price: reasonable ... it saves you from buying adapters, so overall it can be on the lower end of the price range.Looks: the Thrive looks much better than the Asus and Acer which both seem old and outdated and seem like they've been used before; it has similar looks to the Xoom. The iPad looks really good, and depending on your mood you might find it nicer sometimes, but other times the Thrive looks rugged and more serious especially in front of your business associates. It feels somewhat silly to show your boss a document on the iPad. The Thrive looks business-like and mature.Weight and size: yes it's heavier than other tablets, but to me this was one of the reasons why I got it. I used the iPad for 1 month and did not know how to hold it, it slips and the only way to be sure is to rest it on something: I had to lock my fingers on it so it won't drop. The Thrive is not heavy at all in absolute terms. The rims are wide and that's good as your fingers don't interfere with your reading.Status lights: not nearly as bad as some have made it to be. In fact I like them, they make the Thrive seem alive and waiting safely for you to use it like a trusted partner.Screen: it has a very good screen, but the iPad has a better screen, also the Samsung Tab 7\" also has a better screen. Its screen is about equal to Acer, Asus and Xoom.Finish: reading some reviews, you'd think that the Thrive is ugly, but it looks much better in real life than on screen. The silver piece on top is not as bad as some made it to be; I don't mind it. Since the back cover is replaceable, Toshiba can make another version with a different color and texture (the bright colors they currently produce do not go well with the color of the front side of the tablet). Nonetheless, I don't normally stare at the back of it!Battery: good to very good. I doubt many people will spend more time using it that what the battery provides in a 24-hour period. If you do, you need to get a life. The replaceable battery is not an issue to me especially that you need to charge the extra battery in the Thrive itself.Sound: this is also another area where I expected a deficiency based on some reviews, but it is loud enough for all practical purposes.Most importantly: function: the Thrive functions beautifully, no hangs, feels right, and speedy.  The ports are fantastic I use them extensively, especially the full USB. I still don't know what better and faster way to move data to any tablet than the USB. It was a pain to move data to the iPad, which severely limits its use. I don't necessarily need certain data permanently on the tablet, and the USB flash memory allows for such flexibility.Note: I believe your particular situation has a lot to do with how much you like your tablet. I am a male, 42 yrs old, have 2 kids, and work in management, and I need a tablet that can be versatile for all practical uses: documents, pics, notes, email, music, internet, news. I like gadgets and do not have a bias to any specific brand. At home I have different brands, so I buy stuff based on their merits, and for this particular case, the Thrive satisfies all my requirements, and has indeed replaced my netbook. I recommend it fully to those with similar requirements and expectations.", "Date": "September 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "The Thrive is Awesome....BUT!", "Author": "BG", "ReviewID": "R2VUB5VS5C973P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I will first say I love the Thrive and though I never thought I would find a need for a tablet, I have been impressed. My main reason for choosing the Thrive was it's ability to expand the memory with the SD card slot and the USB connection. This feature alone makes the Thrive heads and tales above all others. I won't get into too much of the other nice features as there have been enough said in other reviews here that say it all and of which I agree with.This is what I was not aware of when I purchased the Thrive and I did not learn through the reviews I did read. First, iTunes will not work on the Thrive. It's Apple's way of trying shut out the product. So I need to convert all of my music and videos I have on iTunes if I want to use it on my Thrive. There is software out there in the $30 range that does this and I did get it, but so far it hasn't worked on my laptop. I heard good things about the software but right now I don't have a solution to converting all my iTunes material.The second is, I have not found a portable HD that will work with the Android OS. I purchased the Seagate GoFlex thin HD and it did not work. I contacted Seagate and they told me they don't sell an HD right not that is compatible to the Android OS. I also tried a Western Digital My Passport HD and it did not work. I'm waiting to hear from WD to see if they might have developed a driver so it will work with the Android OS. But the bottom line is, I have not found a portable HD that will work with the Thrive. I would hope a portable HD will be developed soon.The SD slot will take as much memory as you want. I purchased the Lexar Professional 128GB SDXC card and it works like a dream. This card is very pricey right now, but increased my memory 8 times more from the 16GB internal memory.I have tried several different sizes and makes of Thumb Drives and they all work, from a 4GB to a 32GB. So despite the fact a portable HD has not worked yet, the are still plenty of options to expand the memory with the Thrive that other tablets do not.Another surprise to me was how heavy the Thrive is. I don't consider it a negative, but it is the price you pay for having all the features the Thrive offers.The external speakers volume is louder than I was lead to believe in other reviews. The sound is stereo but it's not much better sound quality than the external speaker on the iTouch. With quality headsets, the sound is awesome. When watching a downloaded movie, the sound lets me really feel the movie and hear all the little background sounds. I was really amazed.I have just started to look at MS Office documents and so far they do open but it did not work too well with PowerPoint. It opened the document and I could see the text but not the pictures in the document. Also the document was not laid out as it should be, the text was scattered but readable. I don't know how else to explain it but I couldn't use it the way it was. Word was a little better but not by much. There is a learning curve getting use to the Android OS so it could be me not doing something right. I need to try this feature more to better understand it. On the other hand PDF files worked great.Overall I'm happy with the Thrive and look forward to increasing my uses for it as I get better at using it.", "Date": "August 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "An IPOD - IPHONE - IPAD replacement - forced to prove it", "Author": "Douglas Deltondo \"dougdelt\"", "ReviewID": "R1PL5O4LBEMRN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In Nov 2011, I bought my Toshiba Thrive with 32 gig space, for $370 plus at Best Buy. I had an IPOD Touch Gen 3, but I was on vacation, and wanted Netflix to interface with my hotel room's large screen. My IPOD does it feebly and not reliably. It uses component connections, and I prefer HDMI. I saw the Thrive had full HDMI, and that sealed it.I was being a bit extravagant. I began to find out I indeed liked this tablet for more than just Netflix. Then a crisis hit - I left my IPOD in a store waiting for my wife to try on clothes. My first thought was to just buy a new IPOD. But frankly that is $279--not cheap. And I began to wonder could I make this Thrive function at IPOD's exceptional levels. I now want to share with all IPOD, IPAD, IPHONE lovers that there is another quite exceptional way of operating without those toys and even still link up fully to them. And in many ways, I see Google has prepared a way to a better existence on Android devices than these.First, let me mention that I own a Google TV device. I started to see a similar App store on the Thrive. Netflix works the same. But then I saw apps not available on Google TV that made this device functional almost like a laptop in the same size and weight as the IPAD, but this has forward rear cameras to run Skype. (IPAD1 lacked this.) It has an SD slot like IPAD2. But I found something else that finally freed me from ITUNES -- I don't like ITUNE's policy that if you download on the IPOD music and lost it, then the music purchased is lost unless you synced it to your computer earlier. (My IPOD stopped syncing to the finish 1 month ago, so I have lost 4 downloaded songs due to this 'limitation.') But in the Android world, Google provides Google Music. It is now open to all. You can upload 20,000 songs. So far my Itunes is uploading a mere 3000 songs to Google Music. (You can download for offline listening if necessary.) And I can upload all my 3000 MP3s by simply telling Google where the directories are on my PC...I began that process, and it is still going on without a hitch. Now I can listen to all my music not only on the Thrive but on my Google TV, my PC, Mac, etc. And I conserve space by not having to use the SD card.Second, I like to transfer videos to my IPOD, but it restricted me to playing back only MP4s. I found in the Android world there is a free app MX Video Player that can, with a free codec, play MPEG video files -- my most common format on my PC. No more having to convert to MP4 first that my IPOD required. So my SD card on the Thrive serves as a store of my favorite videos.Third, I am an ebook buyer for almost all books now. I love Kindle books. I had that on my IPOD. I now have it on the Thrive, and it is far more readable. I also have my Barnes & Noble books -- which I formerly read always on my Nook. Now with Thrive, I wonder if I need the Nook. (If you want to save $100, the Nook is a quasi-tablet device now with many available and excellent apps. But it is far from a Thrive.) I also have my Google Books app on Thrive just as on the IPOD. But on the Thrive, I now also have ebooks from the Android community (I think Google books by another name) and an app called Book Place standard on the initial tablet. Book Place has lots of choices of free ebooks, and it appears more than just Google books. Thrive also is a great book reader -- easy on the eyes. I will keep my Nook because so far it appears that it keeps notes better. PS The Adobe Reader for Thrive, if you open an ebook in it remembers it, keeps a library of PDFS for you, and is the best reader of PDFs.Fourth, I found all my key IPOD apps in the Android store. I also found a few which exceed the IPOD. I have my broker's account apps, along with KITCO apps, Mint, etc. I have Loseit, my fav dieting app on the IPOD. I find the google docs app superior on Thrive -- it is one click to see all, instead of a sub page and 2 clicks to start a doc on my lost IPOD. I did lose my Naturally Speaking app on IPOD, but I found the voice translator built in Thrive is pretty amazing. Google Voice app works on Thrive while it was blocked on my IPOD. I liked Gmail on IPOD a bit better....but one feature on Thrive is better -- I can read the stored mail in folders which in IPOD's Gmail I could not figure a way to access. I could only read the Inbox on the IPOD. I have my google contacts and calendar again here on Thrive -- the apps are pre-installed. Also Thrive has a Picasa Photos app which is nice, which I did not have on IPOD. Dropbox works the same on Thrive. I found on the factory-Thrive a Logmein app was standard which I recollect was $$ as an IPOD app. More important, it works--great. Also, very important to me, I happily found my 1Password App (a paid product but operates on desktop simultaneously with IPOD, Thrive/Android, etc., and is vital nowadays--with flawless security.) There is also Pandora and I Tune Radio--free with full access to foreign programs, etc.Fifth, because there is a true File Manager standard with Thrive, you eventually get the feel that this is a mini laptop. You can find audio files, edit word processing and spreadsheet files if you get the Quickoffice or Office Suite Pro suite etc., You can then email them, or copy to SD card and get back to your desktop.So what started out as simply a vacation tablet to play our favorite Netflix programs turned into a forced discovery that this is one helluva replacement for my later lost IPOD. It is bigger but at 1.3 lbs, I found I got used to it. I plan on bringing it to the office, and use the $29 mini-docking stand for charging and to hold up the device so it is always visible like a TV. This way I will keep track of incoming email (also signaled by a gentle sound), my calendar, and I can play music or do pic slideshows. (It multitasks and can do both at the same time.)All in all, I am very satisfied with this device. Oh -- I forgot to mention it has a very innovative interface where you have 3 main panels to arrange apps -- much easier than IPOD...You press down on app image, and then only it becomes moveable, and then you drag to one of the 3 panels and you can easily place where you want. The background photo is more meaningful to make a wallpaper than on the IPOD because you can see it with the spread of the icons on the Thrive's apps. One thing you learn later is that all the apps you download are up in a link in the top right --all in alphabetical order. And in that \"App\"  area you can then press on one of their icons and drag down to one of the 3 panels I mentioned before. It still stays on that \"App\" area accessed through the top right link. When you want to clean up the 3 panels, you simply press on a specific icon, and then the \"App\" link turns into \"Remove.\" You drag the unwanted app there. But it is not entirely gone. You can get it back from the \"App\" area linked through the icon in the top right. This has proven useful. If for space reasons, you want to uninstall an app, that is done by going to the App area via the link in the top right, finding the unwanted app, and this time, highlighting an app toggles to an uninstall icon in the top right. Drag and drop there, and voila, it is gone.I cannot say anyone should not buy an IPAD2 since I never tried it, but (a) this is cheaper; (b) opens to Google's vision which is catching up and may one day leapfrog over the Apple approach, with more open software architecture; and (c) does everything my IPOD did (which is like an IPAD), and (d) has a few tricks lacking in my IPOD (and I suppose in the IPAD2.) I will stop there.... A solid choice. Hope this helps someone in similar circumstances wondering how this compares to an IPOD / IPAD.UPDATE 12-17-2011. I use this at work to keep track of Yahoo email and Gmail. There is an app for Yahoo. I keep the Thrive in a power stand ($25 accessory), and I get beeped whenever mail shows up and then just scroll like on a 2d screen my email. I also found Google Music, which is a game changer. You upload all your old MP3s and your entire Itunes Library (which it stays in sync with later, as you add more) -- 20,000 max songs (free), and you have your music with you wherever you have a wireless connection. No need to worry about if you need more than 8-30 gig this is sold with. (Google's angle? They want you to make them your new ITUNES for purchasing future music. I may just do that....They beat Apple to cloud based music. I also have an Amazon MP3 app to buy from there which is a 2d cloud storage primarily for purchases with it.) I like Thrive's standard \"Gallery\" app because it reads photos off the SD card, and then you hit Play and it does slideshow -- all while my Google Music is playing off Internet. Nice. Netflix works smooth and outputs to TV via HDMI. Amazing new app -- Google Currents -- let's you get free tons of magazines...I like investment stuff and science. There is Forbes, Alpha, Streetwise, and Scientific American. There is also PC Mag, Mac World, etc. I haven't see Google Currents on Ipod / Ipad, but Google supports app on Android Thribe that are free which makes this far more valuable than cost of device. Oh, and I run on Thrive Barnes & Noble Nook and Amazon Kindle app, and thus have the best of both those worlds, plus my Books.google purchases. The openness of this Android operating system, compared to my IPOD, in the end makes this the obvious long term winner. I did not think this would happen so soon, but I think Android has now caught Apple's apps, and is the process of far surpassing them.UPDATE 12-27-2011. I found by accident that Thrive has widgets that display in one 3x2 box my last 3 email, and another Google calendar widget which shows next 6 appointments. You access widgets at the bottom of the screen. You must press within one of the 5 panels, and then you see the widget options fill bottom half of the screen. In the widget options, you see the possible screen size of the 'window' into email / calendar that can be placed on one of the 5 Panels. Before selecting it, you must have enough room on that panel above to fit it. Then drag it up, and voila, you have a great widget. Another discovery: install Evernote app and Dolphin browser. When you like an article, and want it copied to Evernote, in Dolphin, press text on screen, select all, then press top button at right of browser, select \"share\" and select Evernote which then lets you pick what Evernote folder it goes to. Voila, you now have that article properly filed to be used everywhere else you run Evernote - IPOD, PC, Mac, etc. The Dolphin browser lets you save in area below address bar recurrent webpages...more intuitive to set up than competitors. And if you swipe left in Dolphin, you click the bookmark button on bottom to add a bookmark which then allows to place in categories. You have to stumble on that to figure out. But that makes it better book mark system than other browsers except Opera Mobile which is excellent for bookmarks too. Also recommend the Astro file manager app. Free. It lets you copy, move, etc. files, and see folder structure, PDFS, etc., open and organize. Also, Pogoplug app works for music, and download of videos you store there. Thus, gives you your own personal cloud. For NFL fans, the NFL 2011 app gives you vid highlights of all scoring plays in each game -- on game day. I never found anything like this on my IPOD. Several Freecell games are terrible. Finally found Softicks' Solitaires -  only is Freecell. Superior. Also, I hate the standard keyboard input until I purchased Flex9 Text Input. Has dictation option that actually works. I have now made this almost a complete laptop with lots more fun and constant accessibility.

The tablet performs well and will suit most needs.For the record, I do not consider myself wedded to any platform.

I  use an iPhone, and a MacBook Pro, but also run Windows on it to do what I need to do.  Be a fanboy of whatever device you like, but that only makes you easy prey for the marketers, in my opinion.If you are reading through the reviews, you no doubt have a good idea of the specs, so no sense going on that merry-go-round again.Here are the points I like about the Thrive:- decent battery life, with a recharge period which is relatively quick.- the weight really is not a big deal, especially if you use this while lying down (it's resting in your lap most likely, with your feet flat and knees bent), or at a desk (get a good case that allows it to stand vertically)-very good display-no need to have a special program to see the Raw files from my dslr.  Plug it in and view them right there.-Ports really come in handy, as does the sd slot, and the hdmi out.-decent assortment of apps available-Android finger glide typing is easy on the fingersNow here is what really bugs me:-volume switch is poorly placed and has no proper raising to help you distinguish up vs down.  Reading the reviews, I thought it would be no big deal, much like the indicator lights, which people complain about, but are not really such a bother (imho).  Wrong.  The buttons are so poorly placed that at times I have turned the device to sleep mode, pressing power when I meant to adjust the volume.  (njsoftware has a volume control app that gives you a virtual volume control, which helps me avoid this problem).-my slot cover keeps popping out, which is annoying, but not a deal breaker.-Android auto-correct is very annoying, especially when it freaks out while entering text on web pages (like Amazon reviews...grrrrr)-can't delete stupid trial software that I don't want or need.-some Websites refuse to recognize the Thrive as other than a mobile device, limiting you to the  anemic mobile version.  Workarounds exist but I shouldn't have to go through all that.- some major apps are buggy with a few of them being infuriating- lacks a really good universal format video player. I am  currently alternating 4 current players, depending on the file type.-cameras are utter garbageThere you have it.  A bit long, but this is my way of paying forward, as the earlier reviews helped me make my purchase decision.  Hopefully this helps you make yours.A word of caution, do yourself a favour and get an external warranty that covers accidental damage and handling.  I have dealt with warranty departments for several popular brands and they all suck and take forever to replace or repair your item (if they agree and are capable).

Since I received the tablet, the desktop hardly ever gets used anymore and the laptop is used about half the time, now.

I use it mostly to read news using the Toshiba app provided but I also check mail (Google and Hotmail) and shop Amazon.com.  It's great for YouTube and even streams Netflix well.  The sound is a bit cheesy, but it does have Bluetooth, so if you have a nice Bluetooth headset, I would imagine you could get some pretty descent sound out of this tablet.  The battery life is great.  Most recently, I have been setting it up near the tub so I can watch streaming media while I take a hot bath.To be fair, I will mention a couple of things that I wish were different with regard to the device design.  The unit has three LED lights on it, which I think are pretty unnecessary.  One other thing that I might have difficulty explaining; the power button is not next to the power icon.  If you are facing the device and want to turn it off (or on for that matter), you have to press approximately 1/4\" down from the power icon/light indicator to turn it off.  I typically have to turn the unit sideways to find the power button as it is clustered right next to the volume rocker.  Small beans, I know, but a fair comment.Some have complained that the screen isn't as vibrant as some other tablets.  I just finished streaming the Battlestar Galactica Miniseries and it looked fantastic.  I enjoyed watching it so much; I was late to an appointment.In summary, I will say that there are cheaper tablets out there.  Given how much this device has satisfied me, I have no regret in my wife choosing this model.  She knocked it out of the park for Christmas 2011.  As for the title of this review...I used to go to the bathroom, get my business done, and get out.  Now that I have this cool device, I find it hard to resist grabbing it to catch up on the news while I take care of my business equating to more time in the john.  It's a new habit that I hope to break before it gets too engrained.Loo LogisticsI understand that some may feel it pretty discusting to use a tablet while on the john.  To these people I offer some simple loo logistics:1.  Enter loo2.  Sit and begin business3.  Open tablet, and use it4.  Close tablet, and set it down5.  Finish business including all necessary paperwork6.  Wash hands and dry them7.  Exit looThe tablet is never in danger of getting \"contaminated\" because it is never out during any of the dirty work. As it is with most people, hygene is also important to me.  Please keep that in mind.  My review is for fun as much as it is for facts and information.This tablet was purchased, by my wife, on Amazon.com.UPDATE 24JAN12: This tablet will gladly accept any Bluetooth mouse.  It will also accept any USB mouse, automatically.  But will it work with a wireless mouse that has a nano-transmitter, and will the nano-transmitter fit inside the tablet with the USB access door shut? Yes, it works with the tablet but no, the cover will not close.  It's close, but it certainly will not close all the way.  I have attached pictures showing how close it actually is.", "Date": "January 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great design, features and performance.", "Author": "Randy", "ReviewID": "R28SJD93R1XGCE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Although this device is not the most popular tablet on the market (that goes to the iPad and then Samsung Tab 10.1) it is, in my opinion, one of the best.Pros -Full-size HDMI: Great for sharing photos on the go, just plug right into any TV and away you go. Great for streaming movies on the go. Ever been to a hotel and wanted to watch a movie but not pay for their overpriced pay-per-view? Bingo, HDMI out. Now, I haven't tested it yet, so I don't know if the Audio goes out...but I assume it does.Full-size USB: Plug in a mouse and/or keyboard and free yourself from the softkeyboard. Now, on the road the softkeyboard and touch screen are great, but again traveling and setup in a hotel room being able to plug in a mini-keyboard and mouse is a nice feature. There are some nice mini-devices out there that will fit neatly into a travel bag. FYI, I plugged in an old Microsoft Natural Keyboard Pro with a built in USB 1.1 hub and then plugged a mouse into the built in hub...both worked flawlessly. I tried an older Belkin USB 2.0 hub but it didn't work...could have been the hub though...it hasn't been the most dependable. I suspect newer USB 2.0 hubs would work fine.Full size SDHC slot: Being a DSLR photographer this was the MAIN reason I chose this model. My DSLR (Nikon D90) uses the SDHC chips and having the ability to pop the chip in the tablet and quickly start viewing photos is great. I know other tablets (iPad) have adapter dongles, but I really didn't want to fuss with accessories when on the road. I also ride motorcycle, so being able to travel light without a bunch of accessories is nice.Docking Connector: Again, if you're going to plug in a key/mouse and other devices it would be nice to have the option to decapitate the system and run with just the screen, leaving the rest of the salad behind. :-) Helps you turn the tablet into a full-fledged computer too. This along with a mini key/mouse combo could negate the need for a laptop to some.Screen: The screen is brilliant and very clear. No issues at all.Performance: The tablet performs everything fairly quickly, haven't noticed a lag. Now, that said it doesn't seem to be quite as snappy as the iPad at certain tasks, but not so much that you'd really notice (unless you're an avid overclocker or performance geek).Compatibility: I haven't found an app yet that doesn't work with it. Love the Amazon Free App of the Day!Replaceable/swappable battery: Carry a spare to ensure you have enough bug juice on the road! Let's see an iPad do that. Oh, sure you can get those carry along USB batteries...if that's what you want go for it!Cons -Power Supply: The devices uses a power brick as opposed to a USB charger. This means you have to carry a charger around with you if you're going to be gone longer than a day or two. The device does also have a mini USB plug, however when plugged into a computer it does NOT charge, so that's not an option.Cameras: The camera quality stinks. Haven't tried a video chat with the front facing one, but I suspect it'll be good enough for that purpose. Personally this doesn't matter much to me since I really don't see myself walking around taking snapshots with the rear facing (or front for that matter) camera...I always laugh when I see someone do this. Heck, my cell phone (HTC Desire HD) has a good enough camera (8PM) that I can take snapshots with and if I'm doing much more than that I'll have my DSLR. Again...I don't have a problem with it being a crappy camera...but some might.Thickness: Again, a preference thing. If you want thing then buy an iPad or Samsung Tab 10.1, but if you want the features get this device!Build: The case is made out of plastic and it seems a bit flimsy, especially the port covers. But I have it in a leather case so it doesn't bother me. To those who like the feel of the iPad or Samsung Tab 10.1 they may not like the feel of this. Again, go for what's important to you...for me it's the feature set not how cool I'll look sitting in Starbucks.Ice Cream Sandwich (Android 4.0, a.k.a. ICS): It's yet to be seen if this device will get ICS. I've read rumors both ways saying it will and won't...time will tell. Honeycomb runs great and I've rarely had any crashes...there is the occasional Force Close on an app, but honestly it's so rare that I can't remember last tiem it happened. Now, on my HTC Desire HD running 2.3.3 I get regular crashes. Bottom line; Honeycomb seems to be stable.Available Accessories: There are not as many accessories available for this device as there are for some. But, if you look you can find most everything you need. I see there's now a new keyboard docking station case available...I'm heading over to purchase! ;-)Power / Volume button location: ok, this is the one thing that is annoying. The buttons are in a hard location to easily just touch without looking. You'll find yourself turning off the device (sleep actually, not OFF) when you're trying to adjust the volume. As long as you tilt the tablet and LOOK at the button you'll be fine though.All in all, this is an awesome device! The Android device market (not to be confused with the actual Android Market) is rapidly expanding and more and more devices/accessories are hitting the streets daily. I'd buy this one again any day...the features are just too great.

I'm actually writing this review on the tablet right now and I am having no issues at all.A couple of pieces of info that you need to know before buying, and this goes for almost any tablet.  First: you will need to spend a little bit of money to customize the tablet to your needs.  I use mine for business so I needed a couple of paid apps to up the functionality for business purposes, specifically I needed an word processing app (quick office pro HD) a web dev app and a billing app, all of which ran less than $30. You should also get a case to protect it, which will add a little in the way of bulk, but we are talking about about a half inch and a half pound. You won't notice much difference in portability and your investment will be safe.Second: it is not particularly easy to type without an attached keyboard (which the thrive makes easy to get as you can get a UsB or Bluetooth keyboart to use) or you can do what I did and just get used to the touch screen...I would estimate that I can type at about 85' of normal speed on the touch screen keyboard.Lastly: you are likely to spend way too much time playing with your awesome new bit of tech...buy on a Friday so you have the weeked to fool around with it.The Thrive is a great tablet for those who want the freedom of the android OS, the ports that don't come with most other tablets and the functionality that may endup replacing your laptop all together.In short, buy a Thrive, you will be glad that you did.", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Patience!", "Author": "ashlynnk", "ReviewID": "R1W0YCG2YKMCXP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got my Toshiba Thrive about a week ago and I have not really had any qualms with it!

I was considering an iPad and not being able to have Flash was a large setback, and not only that but I have an 8GB iPod touch that is overcapcity, so I wanted something that I was able to use an SD Card. The HDMI hook ups were phenomenal too. When I was talking to my sales person at Best Buy I forgot to ask him about processing speed... I've read a few of the reviews where the screen would not unlock and a hard reset was in order. I did maybe 4 hard resets on my Thrive on the first day and there was talk about returning it for this reason.. but I found out when you push the button to unlock the device you need to give it 2-4 seconds before trying to unlock on the screen... same for the internet. There's a slight delay for the touch screen when using the keypad.. I'm assuming this is the processing speed. If you can deal with the 1-2 seconds it's a wonderful device...

The input/output ports were the primary attractions of the Thrive and my initial judgement has proved to be correct - the more I use the Thrive the better I like it. Since I bought the Thrive I have used it every day. I took it on a 15 day riverboat trip in Russia instead of my 13.3\" laptop and it was wonderful, compact and very useful. Good wifi on the boat so I could check email and web surf with the Thrive as if I were at home. Took over 500 pictures with a 10MP camera and all pictures were stored on the Thrive with plenty of room to spare. I keep a 16GB SD card almost full time in the SD slot, then loaded pictures using a USB SD card reader feeding into the full size USB port on the Thrive. Stored pictures both internally and on the 16GB SD card. So good backup. I also carry a 40 GB digital wallet with USB connection and backed up pictures to it - the USB connection worked flawlessly with the Thrive. I have used the full size HDMI port to connect the Thrive both to my HD TV set and also to an Epson projector using an HP HDMI to VGA connector dongle as my projector does not have an HDMI input. I also have an Android smart phone, so my calender synchs beautifully among Outlook on my desktop and my Google calender on the Thrive, the smart phone and my Toshiba Portege laptop. All told, the Thrive has more than met my expectations. A week or so ago it upgraded to Android 3.2, but I haven't seen any specific changes, altho I have not had the \"sleep problem\" others have reported. No, I do not work for or have any relationship with Toshiba other than using and liking their products that I carefully selected and use.

What can I say about the Ipad killer, and as you can see I don't like anything related to apple so this tablet is a breath of fresh air. It's about time a tablet came out that could stand up to the apple craze. Is this tablet stylish...no, is this tablet thin..no. Is this tablet heavy then most...yes, but here's the deal who really cares! Is this tablet functional? (yes it is) Are you locked in a prison with restrictions like most of the other tablets on the market? The answer is NO!!!! What do you expect of course its gonna be a little chunky after all you have full HDMI/USB, Mini USb not to mention the removable battery.  I'm not gonna bore anyone with the specs as most of us know what this tablet has to offer. I will say that I have been through quite a lot of tablets from the Cruz, Archos,Dell, Galaxy and finally after thinking all hope was lost fearing I would have to settle for the next disappointment along came the thrive. There is nothing bad about this tablet in my opinion, of course nothing is perfect and there may be some hiccups every now and then that's to be expected. I'm still getting my feet wet with this tab, but a stranger to the android platform I am not.I love the android platform. I read a lot of reviews on this site and others complain about the screen I see nothing wrong with the way movies or pictures look on the screen I think the screen is just a vibrant as the galaxy and almost as vibrant as the ipad, I guess in this area like any product it's all about personal preference.

The ports above all and of course the replaceable battery clearly indicate Toshiba was aligned with my line of thought.I've had it about one month, subjected it to some serious useage, tried word processing, and spreadsheets (upgraded to Office Pro), and naturally games. The WiFi works flawlessly with my home set-up and took less than a minute. It logged in to the local Apple Store free WiFi at the Mall with no problems.

I've put it to some good use since I've go it. Phone, gaming device, wardriving, ebook reader and many more functions. I also haven't really touched my laptop since I got this thing. I read the reviews good and bad before I made my purchase and most of the bad reviews complained about a sleep mode of death issue and other software related problems. I didn't really see this as a problem for me because I'm kind of an advanced user and it wouldn't be a big issue for me to install a different firmware to fix this. Battery life has been good. I've gotten some solid days of use out of this with no real issues.ConsThe cameras are pretty good but both need good lighting else it ends up looking some home video you shot in the 80s with some weird filter on it.One annoying thing is when applications close they don't really close. They get cached and eat up memory. I'm not even referring to facebook or other programs that need to stay open to alert you of new incoming messages. For instance if I play angry birds or watch a video and then close it out it still gets cached and I have to go into the device settings to close it out.

Its same or slightly heavier weight, when compared to other tablets on the market, along with slightly greater thickness, are non issues for me. Sure, there is a difference, but not enough to become an issue on a practical level.

Well only after I uninstalled that app did my tablet function normally AGAIN!  I also want to add that the suggestion of turning off wifi by selecting no wifi when screen is off AND turning off notifications by clicking on the time in the lower righthand corner then putting the tablet to sleep manually ,that is, do not wait for the timeout you have set, seems to work like a charm. Toshiba, I have read, knows about this issue and will address it in some kind of software update as it seems to have something to do with the new version of the Honeycomb OS.

With innovative full-size USB and SD card slot built-in, the Thrive is a perfect platform to consume media on the go. But is it a good buy? Compare the Pros and Cons below, and judge for yourself..Pros1) ConnectivityMedia consumption and file transfers are easy and seamless thanks to the Thrive's built-in USB 2.0 and full size SD card slot. The USB 2.0 and SD card slot is what makes this tab stand out from the rest, for the time being. Tip: Connecting 2+ USB slots is possible if you purchase a Plugable USB 2.0 10 Port Hub (with Power Adapter).2) BuildThe tablet feels sturdy and non-slick in your hands. The grippy material on the battery bay underside leaves you more confident resting the tab on your lap. You know it probably won't accidentally slip and fall, and even if it did, the Thrive seems sturdy enough to best the occasional mishap. Toshiba's 1 year warranty (standard on the Thrive I ordered from Amazon) and firmware updates available after registering are also reassuring in this department.3) PerformanceIt's fast and easy to switch between apps, thanks to the Thrive's dual-core Nvidia Tegra 2 processor and Android Honeycomb's application switching menu. The application menu always remains minimized in the bottom left hand corner of your window, and displays a list of your most recently used apps. Thumb through them and switch back and forth, and the Tegra 2 doesn't mind a bit.4) Screen Size-10.1\" screen size makes browsing the web a more familiar and less eye-straining straining experience than on an Android phone.Cons1) Form FactorThe Thrive is bulky enough to wear down on you over time. As I typed on the tablet while resting it between my hands, a downward gravitational pull distracted me from what I was writing. Even with the Thumb Keyboard app installed, I still wasn't able to comfortably type and hold the tablet at the same time. No matter how I positioned the tablet or what changes I made to the keyboard layout, typing was still uncomfortable compared to typing on my Samsung Charge Android Froyo phone.2) FingerprintsThe screen attracts fingerprints easily. I'm sure the same could be said for most other devices out there but it's still a problem. It makes your space tab look all \"used\" by \"humans\" and whatnot. Hopefully this issue will improve as technology improves.ConclusionThe Thrive is a solid option for those seeking an ultraportable web-browsing and entertainment device. The Thrive's form factor is on the bulky side, but it's probably nothing you can't handle. Certainly the device would be at home in a dock, the Toshiba Thrive Multi-Dock with HDMI for 10.1-Inch Tablet (PA3934U-1PRP) for instance.At $480 for the 16GB version, the Thrive isn't cheap. The USB 2.0 port and full size SD card slot are nice features to have, but only impressive relative to other tablet offerings for the present moment. But if you really want to own an Android tablet, right now, I would urge you to consider the Thrive.Final Things to Ponder-A new Acer Chromebook is $350, and almost as portable. It may be a better choice for people who don't need a touch/Android interface.-There are still some Flash issues on Android. Just because Android supports Flash, doesn't mean that Flash works perfectly on Android.-Android Apps SHOULD port from your phone to your tablet, at no additional cost. I've purchased multiple Apps from both the Android Market, and from Amazon's App Store, and I had no problems whatsoever getting all of my Apps to show up on the Thrive. I suspect it could be because I purchased all of my Market apps from the same gmail address.-Android tablet prices are bound to decrease, you can always wait. If you're not sure a tab is right for you, that's exactly what I'd do.-Amazon is an amazing company to order electronics from.

The iPad has its fans, and that's great. But it isn't for everyone. It certainly wasn't for me, though I considered it carefully before I reached that decision. The form factor was not conducive to what I needed it for: creating spreadsheets, mind maps, and Visio-style diagrams.However, the earlier Android tablets and the BlackBerry PlayBook also didn't do what I needed. Either the screens were too small, or the focus on cloud services diminished their functionality in my eyes. The Toshiba Thrive, however, meets my needs.I am not saying it is for everybody. It is heavy, particularly because it is thicker to accommodate the range of ports it offers and the replaceable battery. But it is comfortable for me, and I like something that feels like it won't crack at the slightest nudge. And the built-in ports means I don't have to carry tons of accessories. The all-in-one features and expandable memory are what I need.I knew right away that this was the tablet I wanted. I would have loved a tablet with a Windows-tablet optimized OS. But that isn't coming anytime soon. So this will do, and I am very happy with it. (I have to agree, however, with some of the criticisms regarding the positioning of the cameras. I find that I easily touch them with my fingers when holding the tablet. That is why I gave the Thrive four stars, instead of five.)I can't rely on cloud services. I use the subway to commute to and from work. (And it doesn't help that carriers are aggressively restricting data use.) Relying exclusively on cloud services is a liability for me. I like that I can use a SDHC or USB stick to copy files to and from my or another person's PC. I like that I can connect the tablet to an HDMI-capable television for presentations (at work, we don't use projectors much. We have LCD televisions with HDMI ports).I think potential buyers should take the time to test the devices in the market. Go to an Apple store and compare the iPad to Android tablets (available at most electronic retailers). Not every Android tablet is the same, either. Give them a test drive, and don't listen to the marketing hype. See what works for you.

I can't stand the scroll pad on my laptop, my arthritis KILLS me, so I purchased a USB mouse.  Rumors of an Amazon Tablet had me excited, folks kept bringing up \"Wait for ICS\", etc.  I've been saving for a tablet due to smaller size and portability for a long time.  At some point - the price point meets your expectations, and it is just time to buy.  At the minimum - my apartment is dark, and I can switch between the Kindle and the Tab for Reading, and not spend so much on batteries.  I can also play some games on the Tab - worth the extra bucks to compliment a plain Vanilla Kindle any day (I originally purchased the free 3g Kindle without Special Offers back in December 2010). My Tablet arrived from Amazon on Tuesday - July 12th.  Below are my experiences so far:Pros:1. System Settings to mess around with.  File Manager, App Manager and Storage are handy for deleting files and saving space. Just click by the Time on the bottom bar, and you can get to everything.  Sound and video settings can be set on the fly.2. Screen rather durable, may not need the Screen Protectors.  So far - haven't needed the extra SD card I ordered.  VERY responsive, fast rotation, beautiful graphics (tweak the factory settings for that), first time I've actually LIKED gaming since pre-2000, pinch and zoom very good.  No, I can't play Chessmaster on it (as far as I know) - but I have my Laptop for that.3. The case is PERFECT, just like my Kindle Case.  Since I'm in the middle of a move - no real square footage to sit it up for watching, but will in my new place. You might want to consider a USB Keyboard, especially one with an additional USB port.4. Register ONCE for Google, that's it.  Have your GMail - can sync all data and settings with Google (even some old Picassa pics from a blog I wasn't really interested in).  Don't know WHO I will be using for Cloud yet - Google or Amazon.5. Apps galore.  Haven't purchased DocsToGo yet, but will eventually.  Downloaded Opera, haven't had a chance to set it up (use Firefox on main computer, not so good on tablets).  Read reviews and PERMISSIONS BEFORE DOWNLOADING APPS!!  For instance, TapATalk is a no go.6. Kindle and Archive just perfect.  Yuck on Toshiba books.  If you're into ePub, I'm sure the Reader App of your choice will work also.7. Keyboard is perfect for me in Landscape mode.  No lag, in fact - so sensitive to touch, need to watch my typing.  Easy switch between Qwerty and Number/Symbols.8. Turn Wifi off WAY extends your battery life.  Overnight sleep, still have 74% battery.Cons:1. The Sleep Mode experience.  Apparently - a problem with many.  I just power off, then power on when it won't wake from sleep mode.  If it sleeps for just a little time, no problem.  Its when sleeping for an hour or more - then we have the reboot experience.  My guess? A problem with all the hardware configuration specific to Toshiba and Honeycomb conflicts.  I've had the same problems with laptop sleep and hibernation.  I also get around it by putting to sleep, wake up in locked mode, and put back to sleep in locked mode.2. The News App from Toshiba (Starting Place).  It hangs, can't exit.  Must kill the process.  Would have been nice to use - but so far, not so much.  Can't delete apps - even third party ones that are pre-loaded and will never be used (demo games, Kaspersky, etc.)3. Watch out for too much syncing, you may get downloads from years ago.  Turn GPS off (unless you need it at that point in time).4. Lack of a 3g/4g/etc slot.  I know this is the trend with new tablets, and carriers are taking advantage of it (either a monthly charge, or quite the premium).  I want to spend for 3g/4g on the go, when I need it.  The first to come up with a reasonable MiFi - you get my business.5. Sound: My Sony Walkman Cell Phone was getting better speaker quality (comparison of Bad Romance mp3).  One needs to tweak the SRS settings under Multimedia.  Select settings for each one, turn off default, and press okay.  Turn off Ambient Noise Reduction (or whatever), and the devices sound much closer together.  Sound via flash could be improved (believe they are using hardware acceleration, would need to check flash settings).  Headphones are fine, sound improves with the aforementioned tweaks.Bottom Line:  great compliment to Kindle - now, don't need so many apps (active content) on the Kindle,  Easy to use even if nube to whole experience (but it pays to spend some time in Thrive and Honeycomb forums, watch some Tablet reviews on You Tube).  Build of Tab is great, just a swipe of the glass, keep in Case - and you are good to go.  You can either get the two year Square Trade Accident warranty, or the one year Toshiba Accident Coverage.  Three years is WAY too much for Technology that will probably change in a year.  Will it be the new NetBook?  Competition and price wars are a GOOD THING!  Happy Shopping!", "Date": "July 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "After Shaky Start, Highly Recommended", "Author": "Charleston Software Associates \"WordPress Plu...", "ReviewID": "R2PGZF5O976E8H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "*** UPDATE ***Toshiba has been very responsive about the wake-from-sleep issue.  They have released several patches and the latest one seems to fix the problem.  At least it is waking up just about every time, with only one \"fail to wake\" issue in the past week.  That could be one of the dozens of apps I have loaded just misbehaving.My guess is this problem has been fixed.  The good news is Toshiba was VERY responsive.  Their consumer support 800-line was pleasant but mostly useless.  The forums, however, turned out to be a great resource.  Toshiba is actually reading & responding to the forum posts and have taken an active role in working with people and keeping everyone informed about the issues.At this point I'm certain the problem is resolved.  If not I have full confidence Toshiba will address any remaining issues quickly & professionally.On the PLUS side, this thing is great.  I'm loving it more every day.  My wife and my 5 year-old son use this every day now as well.  It is probably the most used device in the house these days.  There are a ton of great new Android apps coming out every day, my newest favorite is the CNN News app.  It is designed specifically for the tablet and is a quality product.  My son loves Angry Birds, it is a much better experience on this platform over a phone and also a quality app.  Another HUGE plus... the ability to surf just about any site in mobile or standard mode.  MOST sites are WAAAAYYYY better in standard mode, and that is only possible because this device fully supports Flash and almost any other web design element.Very cool.  I'm keeping it and highly recommend it to anyone.  In fact we are probably going to order one for my Grandmother today.*** UPDATE ***Turns out there is a critical design flaw with the Thrive that Toshiba is fully aware of.  The Thrive will not wake up out of sleep mode for 80% of the devices on the market.  My particular unit would come out of sleep mode after a hard reboot (hold down power to power off/hold down power to power on) but eventually hung so badly we needed to do a factory restore with Toshiba Support which wipes everything off the system (apps loaded, passwords, accounts, and anything you've saved).Toshiba is \"fast tracking\" a firmware update but as of this writing it is not out yet (July 14th, 2011).*** Original Review ***I'm a tech geek and I like to play with the latest gadgets.  Both for my business (we write apps for phones, tablets, desktops and the web) and just as a personal hobby.  I regularly update my collection of electronic toys and am always looking for new ways to put them to use.  However I've been late to the table/pad party.  Not because I don't like the idea.  I LOVE my smartphones, having gotten in on the iPhone the first month it came out, upgraded to an Android phone after that.  The general concept is great and certainly has made my life easier.But for the tablets I always walk away wanting more than is offered. That was before Toshiba announced the Thrive.  As soon as it was available for pre-order I bought one at Amazon.  The primary reasons I waited were two-fold, the lack of Flash on the iPad series was a deal breaker there.  The lack of any viable input/output ports on the other devices, poor screen quality, or small screens stopped me from a lot of \"coulda been\" tablets.  The Toshiba promised speed, power, an nvidia chip set driving the video, normal USB ports, an HDMI out, and more.  It sounded perfect.Finally, after 2 months of waiting, the Toshiba Thrive arrived today.  Granted I haven't played with it for very long yet, but I already like a lot of things about it.What I Like:- I plugged in my keyboard and started typing my email responses.  No extra drivers or hacks.  Very cool.  The normal on-screen keyboard works great, but for extended work the keyboard is a HUGE advantage over other tablets.- I then plugged in a small USB hub I had from another project, it is a small 4-port vanilla hub half the size of the credit card.  I then connected my keyboard and mouse.  Now I have the equivalent of a pretty sweet notebook computer with a touch screen. Again no special drivers or other trickery required, I just unplugged the keyboard & mouse from my laptop and put them in the hub on the tablet and it worked immediately.- The screen resolution is great.  Better than I expected but it is not as vibrant as some other screens I have seen.  However 90% of the time I'll be using this in the house or the office and the brightness and contrast is plenty for indoor use and I'm guessing anything but bright outdoor use.- The Honeycomb OS with the Toshiba tweaks is pretty decent.  Not sure if I like it as much as the HTC layer on Android 2.X, but it is right up there with it.- Setup and configuration was quick & painless.  All of my account information, marketplace apps, and more were readily available.  Every marketplace app for my phone is download and runs.  Only one app (WeatherBug premium) is not quite refined for the tablet with some text display overlaps (odd given the extra screen real estate).- There are a number of decent accessories already on the market from Toshiba for docking stations, replaceable backplates, quick-swap batteries, and carrying cases.- Some of the built-in apps are fairly well done.  The news service is a decent app and things like GMail are way easier to use on the Thrive than my phone and the UI feels better than even that on my web browser on my desktop system.- Videos are decent, sound is OK.  Not great, but for something this small & lightweight you really can't expect too much in the way of sound quality with the built-in speakers.- Plays flash videos and other flash content just as I expect.  I've not yet found any broken sites.Things To Improve- It is a little heaver than I expected. It is FAR more convenient/portable than any laptop/notebook I've ever come across.  In fact it is way more powerful, compact, and lighter than most netbooks.  Guess the 10\" screen is a bit bigger and heavier than I've been used to with the 3.5\" (or so) HTC Incredible I've been using for months.  It is not so heavy that it is a burden, but after a 15 minutes of holding it in one hand while playing with the apps with the other hand I needed to rest it on my leg or on the chair arm.  Then again, I'd not hold a notebook up for 30 minutes while using it and this is NOT meant to replace a handheld phone but is a better replacement for a small notebook/netbook.- The screen is not a newer oleophobic(sp?) type that is on most newer phones and the iPad2.  That means it doesn't repel the oil from your hands as well so fingerprints are immediately noticeable.  Not a big deal overall, but for people that want the surface to be clean and shiny all the time you'll need a lens cloth with you at all times.  Which Toshiba does not provide; unusual for most higher end touch-screens these days.- The responsiveness of the power button could be refined.  When it goes to sleep you need to hold the power in for a second.  It doesn't always respond with a quick tap.  Hold it in too long and it powers the unit off.  Not a huge deal, but the timing definitely needs to be tweaked a bit.  Two people in the office have already had issues waking it up and someone already powered it off when it appeared to hang.SummaryOverall I'm glad I waited.  I've not even started to use the Thrive the way I expect, but just the cursory review leaves me happy I waited for this tablet over the others on the market.Also, as a testament to the better build quality of this unit it was already dropped face down on the floor, a thin carpet over concrete.  It made a face-down \"thud\" as it hit the floor and I cringed as soon as I saw it take the fall.  Luckily the protective plastic cover that it shipped with was still on the face. There was no damage whatsoever from a 30\" drop off the edge of a desk, so I've already \"battle-tested\" the unit for those who are curious about the ability for this thing to take a beating.Based on the initial 5 hours with the unit I am thinking this one is a keeper and is something I will be recommending to clients at and our CSL blog ([...]).

I thought I wanted an Apple Ipad when I started looking last fall, but I started with the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 16GB.  The Galaxy Tablet was great in size and performance, but I felt like it lacked some important enhancements, so this is what led to my Toshiba Thrive purchases.Check out this comparison on the units, Apple iPad / Toshiba ThriveBattery replacement cost:  $279.00 Service / $26.88 User replaceable battery(buy extras!)HDMI output:  Not Available / Standard HDMI  portSD card reader:  Not Available / Standard SD card portUSB port:  Not Available / Standard USB portOK, so clearly these features were important to me, but wouldn't anyone want to be able to transfer files via SD card, and USB?

I will take the extra 3 ounces of weight, the extra 3.1 mm of width, its worth it to me to have these basic options.Now if you are looking for the \"coolest\" tablet, well the cool kids buy the Apple iPad, but they are just like the old AOL users, and where is AOL now?

The Thrive is the best of them all, hands down.I won't bore you with specs, but will point out a few things that I deem as important in comparison to others...Top Decision Maker (for me):Removable/replaceable battery (no one else offers user accessible battery), which makes this usable forever!  Other manufacturers (listening Apple and others?) don't make the battery accessible, which means once the battery no longer holds a charge (after 500-1000 charges), you are tethered to the power cord or buying a new tablet (or paying hundreds of dollars to replace a battery at the factory, and most manufacturer's warranty doesn't cover batteries).Pros:Well-built, quality tabletLonger, wider, thicker (which makes it easier to hold onto) than other 10.1\" tablets.2.0 front facing camera / 5.0 rear facing camera (better cameras than iPad or Acer, not just in MP, but also quality)Toshiba is fast on OS upgrades (Ice Cream Sandwich scheduled for deployment in early 2012), and will continue OS upgrades beyond warranty period! (verified by Toshiba support)Interchangeable colored  backs ($5-20), so you are not stuck with aftermarket junk to personalize your tablet or replace a scratched one - factory backs have good grip too!Screen is DURABLE and VERY RESPONSIVEHardware is top-of-the-line, and should hold up to many thousands of hours of use (years)Full size HDMI, USB, and SD card slot... no one else offers all three full-size ports (most manufacturers offer everything in MINI/MICRO, or only one full-size port)Built-in browser is Fire-Fox derrivative (awesome), and file manager is tops... better than many paid versions from the marketBattery life is exceptional... 8-10-hrs depending on use... even streaming video to my TV, it lasts for more than 8-hrs... under \"normal\" app/web use, I squeak nearly 11-hrs out of it before low battery warning pops up!Cons:A bit heavy for some people... not exactly comfortable for one-handed use in landscape orientation (but you get use to it)No flash on rear-facing camera, but then again, who uses a tablet as their primary camera?Power/Wi-Fi/charge LEDs on the front are a bit distracting, but no deal breaker in my bookMemory issues:Some people are complaining that Application memory is limited to 2.9GB... this is NOT true... Toshiba has allocated blocks in 3GB sections to keep the OS running smooth and fast... as you add Applications in excess of the primary 2.9GB, another allocation block will be given to App storage.  This is done (brilliantly might I add) because some people use the tablet to run Apps, some for picture, music, video, documents, etc.... by allocating \"blocks\" for storage (think HDD partitioning), you get space prioritized for what you \"want\".If you cannot decide between tablets, and like so many of us, don't want to be an i-person... give the Thrive a good look... Price is better than most out there (far cheaper than Zoom or Galaxy), quality is tops, service is excellent, and you won't be disappointed with the outstanding performance!UPDATE:After my wife's Arnova 10 G2 died (less than 90-days old), and the warranty replacement arrived with a cracked screen... she'd had enough... she went to the store where she purchased it and traded up to the 16GB Thrive (personally, I think she was just jealous of mine, lol).", "Date": "December 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love my Thrive!

I couldn't compete with Kaio's Thrive Diary review. I bought the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7 on a whim, because it was on sale and looked cool. I used it a few times, but it just didn't feel right. It seemed like it was small, difficult to figure out, and I was afraid of breaking it. It sat around, for months until a co-worker of mine said he was looking for a tablet. I sold it to him and he loves it.I bought the Thrive on a whim, because it was on sale and looked cool. I questioned my sanity since I already had one tab sitting around at the time, and preferred hauling around my 17\" laptop. The Thrive sat around my apartment for a while before I finally gave it a chance. I don't know, we just connected with each other somehow. I love that has a place for an SD card. Your can talk cloud all you want, but when you don't have internet connection and can't access your online content, nothing beats local storage. The full size HDMI port makes Angry Birds life-size on the 70\" TV I use at work. For the most part I find it very straight forward and easy to use. My only issue, is multiplying icons. For some reason, my app icons seem to duplicate somehow so that I have 3 bookplace, and 2 fandango. I haven't figured out how to delete those yet, but they haven't by any means grown out of control considering how long I've been using it.As others have mentioned, it's larger than other tablets without necessarily weighing all that much more. It has a rubberized back which helps you hang onto it better, and you can even purchase replacement backs in different colors, to make it more personal. Currently, Amazon is selling them for around six or seven dollars each. The Thrive has a removable battery, so if you ever have issues with the battery, there's no need to pay an arm and a leg to ship it back to the manufacturer to have it replaced. I'm really surprised that the Toshiba Thrive hasn't earned more respect and higher ratings from professional reviewers such as CNET.Probably, one the best things about the Thrive, though it is not exclusive to Toshiba, is that unlike Apple (iPad), Amazon (Kindle), and Barnes and Noble (Nook), you can load any apps you want onto it. You're not trapped into a limited marketplace selection of apps or music. Why would I choose between a Kindle or Nook, when both of their apps and books are available on an Android by Samsung, Acer, Toshiba, or many other companies? The only reason I can think of is that they advertise better, and charge less if you don't know where to shop. Don't even get me started on Apple!While I love the Thrive's 30 watt charger, and super fast charge time, it would be nice if you had the option for a non-proprietary charger, such as USB or mini-usb. I tend to lose things, and have already lost my first charger, and my first back-up charger. Also, carrying around the charger can be a bit of a pain, because it is roughly the size of a laptop charger, and tablets are supposed to be portable. It's a good thing that the battery life isn't too shabby. I use the Juice Defender App to conserve the battery. Not sure how well it works since I loaded it as soon as I got the tablet.I won't recommend any more apps, except for Opera web browser, since this a product review, but I will recommend the brown leather Navitech case that I bought for it on Amazon.In closing if you are looking to buy a Tablet, I highly recommend this one, or another one by Toshiba. They sell quality products. I'm typing on this review on a Toshiba laptop I've used nearly every day for the past 7 years without any hardware malfunctions or overheating. I'm glad Toshiba remains open-sourced, and considers the customers who want to customize their products with whatever accessories, and apps they wish.

After watching an ton of videos, reading 1000's of reviews and playing with them at the stores, I made my choice. I decided to go with the Toshiba Thrive because of the many features and the very reasonable price. I have a smart phone so I can get most of the job done with it if I'm on the go and I also own a very impressive laptop for the home. I wanted a tablet though for quick rounds on the internet,  social media sites and movies for travelling. The Thrive is more than capable to cover anything I can throw at it. It is, in my opinion, better than an Ipad or any other tablet out right now. It has a very nice price tag for the 32GB is much much cheaper than an Ipad, has more ports for connectivity ( full size USB, full size HDMI, mini USB, and full size SD card) most other tablets either don't have the ports or offer them in a mini version which requires you to buy special cables or adapters. The other highlight is the removable battery, it holds a charge for a while during browsing and movies, but in the event it dies during use you have the option to change it out for a spare battery and keep going. Others make you stop and charge... i don't really have much to say about the camera other than it is 5MP and takes great pictures but the size of the tablet make it awkward to hold and snap. The forward facing camera is so so. The screen looks great during browsing and movies! The Thrive is also quite durable! I have dropped mine from waist onto a tile floor and it didn't even flinch! The screen was fine and remained on, the battery stayed in and it works as good as ever. I have to admit is was worried it was going to be shattered when I looked down but NOPE! All good! It has a rubberized back and is slightly thicker than most tablets, a con for most people but I perfer it. It also has two speaker on the side that rock out pretty loud. My only complaint about the Thrive is that the rear camera sticks out approx. 1mm, so when you lay it on a table it it the first thing to touch. I feel like it takes a bit of abuse and supports the weight of the tablet. I recommend the Thrive because it is the best bang for the buck and if you like something that looks and performs top notch this is it! Plus you don't have to worry about them dropping a Thrive 2.0 the day after you buy it like apple likes to do. The Thrive is and will be way ahead of it's class even when the others are are still releasing upgrades.

I may just be use to the period being beside the space bar from using my phone.It runs on a single charge for quite awhile, I can't say for sure as we tend to keep it on cord power when not in use, but I know it lasts longer than the 3 1/2 hour drive to grandma's house.One of the things that drew me to this tablet over other brands is the feel. I am perhaps in the minority with this, but I am not a fan of small and light... I picked up the Galaxy tab and felt like I was going to snap it in two. I know it would probably take a lot more than I could do to actually accomplish that, but it was the impression. The thrive is heavier and thicker, and feels more rugged, especially with the textured back. I also feel more secure giving this to my 6 year old boy to play on. It has already been through a few knocks and drops and come through just fine. I don't know if it has been luck or design, but it seems to land on the thicker back side when dropped while being held, perhaps due to the extra weight.Speaking of drops, it would be nice to have a small slot down one side for a wrist strap where the strap could be pulled out to attach for a little extra protection against falls... or even just a ring to attach a clip-on strap to.As a nod to other reviewers, I can definitely understand where the weight would be an issue over a long time for some.. I tend to just lay it down or prop it up against something if the weight becomes an issue. It isn't so heavy that regular use is going to replace your upper body workout, but you will definitely notice it after holding it up for awhile. It usually takes me about an hour or so before it becomes annoying, your results may vary.The android market has supported the Thrive well, though I have noticed a few applications that are not available, but with the SD port, I have been able to side load a lot of them.The one thing I am noticing about the Thrive is the lack of accessories. We shopped around for a case and just ended up getting a 10 inch Targus generic tablet bag. It would be nice to see the market round out the selection with some specific cases made for the Thrive, and an accessory pack including car chargers and the like.This is a great little machine that really does everything you would want, and at a price lower than the competition.", "Date": "December 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best tablet out there!", "Author": "Damon Bradley", "ReviewID": "REAXPE3OLKONC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "OK, after seeing my niece get an iPad2 I began a search for my own tablet. I even bought two others, only to return them: the price wasn't worth the poor quality/performance they gave. I would have bought the iPad2 since I LOVE the style and size of it (only the HP TouchPad is similar in size) but I didn't want to get locked into the Apple APPS, iTunes, and other closed-systems that the foolish Apple company seems to prefer. Also, the thing that really killed my purchase of an iPad was the complete lack of anyway to upload your data to it: no USB or micro-USB port, no SD slot, NOTHING! How dumb can anyone be? USB stands for UNIVERSAL serial bus, that means everyone is using it! That means your product should use it as well! Apple dummies. I went to Best Buy after reviewing for many hours on Amazon the various tablets and settled on the Thrive 32G. The price was high, $500+ but its a beautiful machine. The battery life last far longer than most people would use it; are you REALLY going to sit and play with the thing for 7+ hours? Haha. I doubt it. In addition, the Thrive has a gorgeous display.On the down side the Thrive is very thick and bulky, AND heavy! I don't like this. Its also a rectangle, not a nice square like the iPads. If the Thrive had been iPad sized, I would have rated it 5 stars, weight not-withstanding. Its also NOT loaded with alot of bloatware or junk, which is nice. I dislike the fact that it came with almost NO instructions, you have to print it off yourself from the Toshiba site; come on guys, LAMESAUCE! Give us a physical instruction book, okay? Some people many not have a printer, geez. Oh, and it collects fingerprints, so I am gonna have to get some sort of cover. Finally, it came with nothing extra; no extra battery, no carrying case, NOTHING. Hey Toshiba guys, do yourself a favor and stand out in the tablet market by supplying a physical instruction manual and an extra battery or case: you might get extra sales by adding a few minor \"extras\" like these, you will certainly get word-of-mouth if you give out a few of these simple goodies.Overall the product is excellent, I will be showing it to all my family and friends and am THRILLED to have a full-sized USB port in it: I can attach all sorts of stuff to it and use my thumb-drives to really make things hum.

The iPad was right out of consideration for its price and \"locking\" into the Apple domain of apps and content.  I ordered a Fire the day it was announced, ready to compromise on features I didn't think I'd care about (size, cameras, connectivity, Android version) for its great price and access to Amazon content.  Then I ran across a Groupon deal to get the Thrive for a hundred dollars off.  I took the plunge and cancelled my Fire order.I am loving this tablet!  It has a beautiful screen, feels great in my hands, and can run apps from both Android Marketplace as well as Amazon's App Store.  Just a note on that point, I find I am getting the vast majority of my apps from Amazon.  They have a LOT less \"junk\" apps which are really cluttering the Android Marketplace, and their Free Paid App of the Day is invaluable (okay, its value can be calculated, but it's growing each day).While I have yet to use the full-sized USB or HDMI ports, I expect I will soon.  What I have used a LOT is the camera for taking pictures and video.  I honestly thought I wouldn't use a tablet that way, but its quality and usability is actually preferred over my Galaxy S.One of the main drawbacks of this tablet is its size/weight.  It is noticeably thicker and a couple ounces heavier (which is not as noticable).  I would love this tablet if it were thinner, but I honestly haven't felt it to be an issue thus far.  I am carrying it around with me everywhere!  Others have mentioned its textured back and I agree it makes for a much-improved experience when holding it and helps off-set the thickness.Accessories I have bought and recommend include the Toshiba-branded case which supports landscape set-up (would like it if they allowed for portrait as well), the ArmorShield screen protector (a bit of work to apply, but worth the cost/effort), and the AYL capacitive pen (pen input is obviously valuable for many usages like drawing and surprisingly valuable for some usages like gaming).If you care more for sleek looks and thin tablets, this may not be the one for you, but don't overlook this tablet for all its features and advantages.", "Date": "December 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "A little bit of a learning curve", "Author": "S.

It just seemed all about Steve Job's vision, not mine. I thought it sucked that all my time was spent getting my music and pictures to work the Stevie Way and having the nonstop spamming from iTunes.Also the limits of (1) no input / output other than iTunes (2) no possibility of adding more memory (3) very slow processor speed  (4) I never felt anything about an iPad was intuitive to me. Finally, the patronizing and condescending attitude of several Apple folks in trying to get their help in dealing with issues their product had was irritating also. The iPad to me, just felt like a nerd's answer to a real world challenge.While looking at alternatives I came across the Thrive. Add memory up to 128 gb sd card (I'm told), dump in music and pictures by just plugging in a usb cable, finding the tablet, open the window and drag your music and pictures onto it. Take that Steve.After a couple of hours of playing with the Thrive( without a manual) I had it 90 % figured out. So many cool ideas like all my book marks in a window on my primary screen. Web sites ? Just book mark and there they are.  Don't need that one any more ? Drag it to the trash can. Speed ? On decent WiFi this is mostly as fast as my HP laptop. The color resolution is great and initially it feels like the battery life is better than my iPad. It does recharge in a fraction of the iPad time. Like 90 minutes to full. I haven't really worked with the camera yet, but a couple of quick shots looked good and the zoom was awesome.The only criticism I have is of the speakers. They are so bad, but just plug in your ear phones and party on.Also, the battery is user swapable. I will probably pick up a cheap non OEM spare when available (not now) but the OEM is about $80. Call Apple and tell them you need a battery in your iPad. AHAHAHAHAHAHA !At this moment, the competition hasn't quite caught up with the Thrive's accessories so prices on screen protectors, cases, holders and chargers aren't rock bottom yet, but I expect they soon will be. They are still very reasonable, just not give away. You can change out the back cover to six different colors for $20 (each) if that's your thing.In total, I would grade the iPad a 3 star based on how it made my life more complicated, not less. If I could give the Thrive a 6 star, I would. Seriously, this might not be your dream tablet, but it's mine. Toshiba Rocks.

In summary of owning this thing for the last year and a half, I purchased it for the hardware, but was disappointed by the software. After a 100 dollar price drop within a few months, that did sting a bit. I had it for about a year of OTA software updates that fixed the SOD, and also found out that the audio aux quality was poor due to software, not hardware. In closing, I DO NOT recommend that if you decide to purchase this ill fated product that you upgrade to 4.0.4 or Android ICS through Toshiba's OTA. It will boost overall performance and fix the audio aux problem, however the wifi browsing speed has slowed to a crawl and the \"Sleep of Death\" has returned. Also with this update they \"lock the bootloader\" which means that once the warranty expires and Toshiba no longer supports it (like they really ever did during the warranty period), you will not be able to root the device to extend its use by flashing further updated OS. I never though I would root myself, but ever since I OTA the ICS, I regret my decision.*********************************************************************************************************************************************************ADDENDUM*** on 7/18/11Just like another positive poster did, I am going to have to add a \"CON\" that will make my star rating a \"3\" if you look this up on multiple forums, you will find that after a brief period of time in sleep mode, you will not be able to wake it up unless you do a hard reset.

I plan on keeping my tablet for the reasons listed below and with hopes that a firmware update will fix the problem, BUT I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE ELSE BUY THIS TABLET UNTIL THERE IS A GUARANTEE THAT THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN FIXED.***********************************************************************************************************************************************I began searching for a tablet because the use of PDA's has now become long gone to the world of smart phones and tablets. The primary use of this tablet was to act as a PDA and install Epocrates, Medscape, etc to assist with school and clinical rotations, and got allot more than I bargained for.I own a Ipod, and cannot stand the exclusivity of it where it only will play AAC file formats and can only use I tunes to transfer files. I also use an Ipad at work, and the back of it, as sturdy as the metal is, is very slippery without a skin on it and the touch is less responsive than I would like. Also another downfall of apple is that there is no option for expansion.I have had my thrive for a week now and I love it, the possibilities of it's use are endless.The \"wide screen\" display allows me to watch movies the way they are intended. Also, when you rotate it vertically, you can use your thumbs to type on the keyboard, which is not so easy on the \"square\" tablets.With the right apps, it will play any movie and music file formats. I decided to expand the storage with a 64GB SDXC card, to which I now have a decent amount of my favorite music and movies on the tablet with some room to spare.With the HDMI, Full SD, and bluetooth capabilities, I am able to connect a keyboard, mouse, and watch it all on my HDTV. As soon as I plugged in the mousefrom my desktop, a cursor appeared immediately .Data transfer is easy, and does not require an \"I tunes\" program. SD, thumb drives, and every one of my external hard drives are recognized (those who do not know how to format to exfat on windows 7 need not apply.)The rubberized backing is comfortable and negates the need for additional accessories.The Honeycomb operating system is fast, and I love the multiple \"desktops\" in which I can organize school apps on one, entertainment on another, weather and news.....etc.The Wifi receiver works well, for I still use a basic five year old Belkin wireless router and the web surfing speed does not suffer a bit.The only cons I have found so far is when attempting to remove the back cover to access the battery, I feel like I am going to break the connectors every time I do it, and have no intention of buying a spare battery to switch back and forth, unless the first one dies.I have nothing to report concerning the battery life at this point, because I have not used it outside the house yet and usually keep it plugged in to save the battery.Is this tablet heavier and thicker than the others, yes but that does not bother me. The extra ports that the other tablets lack is more than worth the extra bulk.

The spacing of the keys, as well as the key sound, make it very similar to a traditional keyboard.I use my Thrive with the portfolio case, so it does add extra weight to the unit.

I was initally going to get a Xoom, but the non-working SD card slot was a deal breaker for me, the Samsung Galaxy did not have any USB or SD so I chose the Thrive. I have had my Thrive for almost 2 weeks and it had pretty much lived up to my expectations. I have had no problems with using the USB port with flash drives, it was unable to see my external drive. The failure to come out of sleep has gotten a lot of complaints, but it is not a deal breaker for me. After reading the Toshiba forum, I downloaded Advanced Wi-Fi app, which prevents the Wi-Fi from shutting down in sleep mode. The theory is that if the tablet is downloading, updates, emails, etc, and the Wi-Fi shuts off in the middle of the download, it causes the issue with coming out of sleep mode. The Advance Wi-Fi app has worked so far, until Toshiba comes out with a fix.Aside from that, the Thrive has been everything I wanted in a tablet. I can remotely log into my work computer through LogMeIn and Splashtop, no problems connecting my work email, it picked up my wireless printer, although I haven't tried to print yet. I put a 32gb card in the card reader and have had no issues moving files into the card from the tablet.As far as the weight and feel of the Thrive, it feels bulkier and heavier than the iPad. It almost seems as f the Thrive is twice as thick as the iPad, however for me that was the trade off for the SD card, USB, mini USB and the ablilty to replace the battery.Overall, despite some, to me minor issues, this is a great tablet that gives me most of what a laptop would in a tablet sized machine.", "Date": "July 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Toshiba Thrive Review", "Author": "John \"Jaborwaki\"", "ReviewID": "R2NKDQIA36DZQ0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Several months ago when I first saw a Toshiba Thrive being displayed at CES, I knew I wanted it. I have to admit that I was sold on several aspects of the Thrive, that as of today are not unique to this tablet. To be upfront right in the beginning there are a few other Android tablets out now that compare quite competitively with the Thrive and offer some of the same features that makes the Thrive desirable. I have had my Thrive for about a week.Why should you consider the Thrive?-The price is cheaper than most Android tablets on the market now. Cheap enough that the Xoom has recently reduced in price by $100 to compete.-The Thrive is not tied to a carrier. Note that neither are the Asus and Acer tablets.-This tablet has ports. Full sized HDMI, USB 2.0, mini USB, and SD card, and of course headphone. It also has a port for Toshiba's docking stations which can be found by searching here on Amazon.-Some might not like that Toshiba has taken a different approach to aesthetics, pulling away from the apple look but some will. The back cover on the Thrive is grippy and comfortable. I never feel like I am going to drop this tablet.-Removable battery. And the back case is not as hard to remove as some reviewers have suggested. I have never had a problem removing it.What are the negative elements to the Thrive?-The biggest one, that has not been mentioned as much as it should is that currently there are a few bugs that Toshiba has not caught before shipping. Many people are experiencing a problem where the Thrive when gone into sleep mode, freezes, requiring a reset. This could be a big distraction, but I don't think anybody would argue that a patch will be released to fix this problem, hopefully soon.-The extra ports that make the Thrive so handy, also slightly add to the overall weight of the product. I am a fairly big guy, so this doesn't bother me, in fact I like it somewhat. But in reality, most people would not care for this. I need to say that the Thrive is actually lighter than my iPad with it's case on. I might not get a case for the Thrive because of the grippy back cover, which I have not mentioned yet is replaceable.-Android 3.1 is not yet as functional as the 2.x phone OS. This is not a Thrive problem, this will be the same for the Transformer, Xoom(3.2 coming soon) and others. When Toshiba updates to 3.2 there things will be smoother in many areas.-The power button and volume rocker is in a bad position with buttons that are hard to find. Google it, many people hate this.Neutral elements-The Thrive uses a very Toshiba like charger. It is not USB, and is attached to a small power brick. A typical laptop charger. This is not a negative thing though, since I have noticed that the device charges in 2 hours.-Camera front and back, no flash.-Screen is plastic, no gorilla glass. But very very durable. There are videos on the internet that show people trying to scratch the screen. If you are questioning the screen, Google these videos.If you get it.. Have fun plugging in your SD cards, keyboard and USB mouse. And thanks for letting me review this.

I have not owned a tablet yet, but after doing a lot of research, I decided to purchase this one. It has a lot of advantages over other tablets.Pros:- File System: The file system in this tablet is great! It allows you to view files just like on a PC. I have heard some folks say they've had problems plugging in external drives that are written in FAT32, but I have had no issues. It's super easy to just drag and drop files from your computer onto the device with no iTunes or other programs!- Extra ports: This unit has so many ports and it makes it very versatile. I use the SD card slot frequently for cheap storage of files and transferring files around. These ports, combined with the file system, make it very much like a normal PC and it can connect to many other devices.- Battery: The user replaceable battery is great for power users. You can easily buy a backup battery to take with you if you need more power. The battery life is decent but not spectacular. I can normally get 7-10 hours depending on what I am doing. However, it recharges very quickly, only taking about an hour or so.- Web browser: This tablet supports Flash and does pretty well with browsing the Internet. I have had the browser crash on me if I am trying to load a huge Flash file though, so it's not perfect. However, the speed is great.- Keyboard: This unit has Bluetooth and a USB port, so it's really easy to plug in a keyboard if you need to do any amount of typing. Typing on the touch screen can be sort of annoying, but it's easier than any other tablet to rectify.Cons:- Thickness: This tablet is pretty thick, which may be a turn off for some people. I find it doesn't weigh that much more than other tablets, but it is a lot thicker. This tablet doesn't pretend to be pretty while sacrificing ports, so it's a trade off.- Lack of tablet apps: I've been able to run most Android phone apps on this tablet, but there's not a ton of Honeycomb-Tablet specialized apps on the market. However, I am sure more will be released with time.- Cameras and buttons: I find the cameras on this unit are not very good. The are decent, but nothing that spectacular. They are probably about as good as a low end webcam. The power button can also be hard to reach sometimes. It's not too horrible, but you need to try if you want to turn it off.Some people are saying they have trouble with the screen brightness. However, if you just turn off auto brightness, the tablet is very bright. This does drain the battery more though. I have yet to have an issue with having to hard reboot it from sleep mode, but people have reported that as an issue as well.Overall, I love this tablet. It doesn't look as slim or as pretty as some other tablets, but it's very functional.

Having the extra media inputs is AMAZING. Having a full size card reader is AWESOME. Upgrading to Ice Cream Sandwich immediately after purchase worked out all the bugs and frustration I was having with it. There are a few tiny things that are kind of annoying, what Android is perfect? I still give it a 5 out of 5 because I see it's still selling for around $400 and I paid about half that!

There were some complaints of people saying they could only READ usb and SD card media, but I have no trouble reading AND writing to sd card and USB.

I'm glad the charger is larger because if that means I can charge to 100% in about an hour and be on my way, that's fantastic. Why is anyone focusing on the size of the charger?

For those who wish their tablet to be closer in function and capability to their laptop but less bulky and cumbersome for use in various circumstances and places, the Toshiba Thrive 10.1 is the answer.While there are some who complain that Thrive weighs in at a \"heavyweight\" (for tablets) 1.6 pounds, and is slightly over half an inch thick, there are those, like myself, who simply appreciate the convenience of having not just a USB, but also a mini-USB, as well as a full SD/SDHC/SDXC card slot, along with full HDMI, for 720p video output. The ability to add storage with USB or SD is exactly what the doctor ordered for this user.The speed of the Thrive should satisfy most anyone, offering a 1 GB internal DDR2 memory, 1 GHz NVIDIA Tegra 2 dual-core mobile processor, GeForce graphics, and all powered by Android 3.1 Honeycomb. I am not a gamer so cannot speak to that, but movies run seemlessly. Thrive has rich and vibrant screen color which is on par with any tablet that I have tested/sampled on the market today, and is, actually, better than most, while allowing us to adjust the LED backlit display as we like. That comes in handy for tweaking color just a tad.The ease of customizing settings and the entirety of the interface is very satisfying, all without having to plod through a dreaded User's Manual. And, anyway, aren't user's manuals only for reference when one finds themselves in a jam? (Mostly serious on that last comment/question...I hate user's manuals, if you couldn't tell.) I was able to set up my interface the way I wanted within minutes.Of course Thrive comes standard with stereo speakers and headphone jack, GPS, digital compass, Adobe Flash support, and a dock connector port. I have not yet purchased the dock but the other functions on my 8GB unit work great. I have not noticed any flaws in sound quality, as some reviewers have mentioned. The back cover detaches and, aside from being able to customize Thrive's exterior color scheme (I prefer and have Blue Moon) provides access to a removable battery. I find that the ability to access and change, if ever needed, the battery a nice plus.The Wireless-N works great and it is easily tethered to any free hotspot encountered. The 5mp back facing camera works good but I do not really plan to use it much as I own Nikon DSLRs. The 2mp front facing camera is more than adequate for its job.All in all, for a person looking for a reliable, fast, well-built tablet that acts and works more like a laptop than a smart phone, then Thrive is a perfect choice.", "Date": "November 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not perfect, but not bad either", "Author": "Curt Rapp", "ReviewID": "R3E7B1PFNNUX39", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The first tablet I tried was a Galaxy Tab.  It had a great display, was light weight, and very fast.  However, it lacked support for SD cards or thumb drives and only had a proprietary USB connector for recharging and file transfer.  My review of the Thrive is somewhat a comparison between the two.  The Thrive is much heavier and thicker.  That makes it feel much more substantial than the Galaxy and allows for a full sized USB and HDMI ports and a mini-USB port.  It also supports full size SD cards.  The back has a waffled surface for better grip and is removable to allow for battery change out which is not possible on the Galaxy.  You can change the back out for different colors, but that's just fluff and the backs are expensive.  The Thrive control buttons aren't as easy to find by feel and the power light is annoying.  It also blinks while in standby which shortens battery life.  I haven't found a way to turn it off, but that would be a great option.  The display quality is somewhat lower on the Thrive compared to the Galaxy.  Also, there seems to be big difference in overall speed between the Galaxy and the Thrive.  I don't know if it's different chipsets or firmware or both, but it's noticeable.  You can't video conference over Skype because the Thrive uses the Tegra chipset and many Android apps available for my Droid phone aren't for the Thrive.  One big drawback is the Thrive uses a 120v recharging brick which means you can't use the USB cable for charging.  The big factor is the Thrive is $100 cheaper than the Galaxy.

So, here's the problems!!!The gyro in it seems good, but is not read properly by any app. (Maybe due to screen rotation) But games, that use the tilt or rotation, will be a mystery at how it responds, till you realize that the tilt is recognized as rotation... and augmented reality apps, also you're just screwed.The bloatware apps, just suck. A antivirus? If you've got a problem where you need an antivirus on your tablet, you may need to rethink what you're doing with your technology. All stock apps require a MONTHLY fee! (Except for the NFS game. I believe.) I don't mind paying $2 for an app, or $20 if it's worth it. BUT DO NOT Stick me with a monthly cost. WTF is wrong with you???Let alone, they're all system apps, you can't delete them. (Awaiting root.)I didn't like the home screen/launcher. It was just too awkward to use (just too different from stock Android). So since I have paid for LauncherPro, I downloaded that from the market and installed it on my tablet. It's not the best, and had to do some major configuration, but it works. And allows me to hide the system apps that are junk. I'm sorry but device manufactures need to stop making software, and just make hardware... quit customizing an OS or Additional Software, with crap we don't need, or want. (Update: Yes I realize that the launcher is the default android launcher for 3.x, I may go back to it. But I like the customization I can do with LauncherPro. LauncherPro is the android 2.x launcher/home screen source code, with some customization capabilities added in. Not meant to be an advertisement, but credit is due.)I'm a little disappointed that Toshiba, isn't more open with allowing rooting. They've made some strides to make it more difficult, but I don't think it's impossible to root the thing.USB doesn't provide enough power or something to allow my YubiKey to work. To get around it, I got a powered usb hub, and got it to work. I use the YubiKey for work VPN, and if I can get the VPN configured correctly, the USB port working with the yubikey is a must. Everything else seems to work on the USB... maybe it's just a little shy on power. (USB Hard drives that rely on additional usb power also don't work.)It acts a little funny when sleeping.

I have had it now since July 12th and use it everyday.  I am an active member of the Thrive forums and have had the SOD and automatic on issue as well.  I am still SOOO happy with this Tablet!  I won't bore you with the technical details nor the advantages of the ports for that has been discussed over and over.  I will say though, I am happy with Toshiba for dealing with these issues unlike any manufacturer of computers I am aware of to this point.  The tablet is thicker which is a GREAT thing since when I held the iPad and the Galaxy they were too thin for me and felt like I could snap them with a good push (I wish I could try that sometime).  The Thrive is built sturdy, has tons of great features and will have support for aircards, NTFS formatted drives and Netflix soon enough.  MY sleep issue has been eradicated with their last update.  So if you are on the fence about this issue don't worry...it's all good.It rocks and is getting better with all the support updates.  Having the SD card (I have a 128gb SDXC card) is awesome.  Full USB was used many times to load in files from my other computers and don't get me started on the HDMI.  I see no real flaws in this unit at all that have not been addressed.  Placement of cameras, battery, etc...is all revealed to everyone.My ONLY gripe at all would be placement of the volume control.

I find the voice recognition feature to be very useful, it is the best of any device I have used no matter what the operating system. I chose the Thrive because of the full size USB ports, the clear display, the removable back, and the features that it has.

The full size SD card has proven to be most useful. I can easily transfer files between my laptop and the Thrive by quickly changing the card. I have been very pleasantly surprised by the battery life of the Thrive. I can easily get 8 hours of use out of a full charge and it seems to last forever in standby.

Just go check out some app reviews in the \"Android Market\" and you'll find that some of the other more popular tablets, like the Galaxy are listed more often with bad reviews of apps because the app doesn't work with their proprietary architecture, and application of the Android Operating System. There are inconsistencies and incompatibilities in some of those other devices.2)  In my experience, my Toshiba has had NO PROBLEM running any app that doesn't have universal problems. But, by avoiding those apps that have less that 3 to 4 stars or better, I have rarely had problems. And the problems are fixed quickly by the developers because they're universal problems and they update them quickly.3)  I have had absolutely no mechanical problems with this tablet and have used and appreciated the full sized ports on this device. I also love being able to add another GB of Secure Digital (SD) card slot, compatible with SD, SDHC, and SDXC media. Just be careful and make sure you ***unmount*** your Toshiba from your computer before disconnecting it from the USB port, or you could damage the SD card, especially the 'micro' cards. Also, if you remove the SD card from the Toshiba, be sure to ***unmount*** from the tablet as well. When the SD card is installed, there is an icon in the lower right shaped like the card. Just tap on that icon and a pop up offers the option to dismount the card. It's that simple. The trick is... Remembering to do it.4)  If you've read the reviews suggesting an unusually fragile screen? I wouldn't be too concerned. Granted, it's not the \"Gorilla Glass\" I've read about and would really like, but I've had NO problem with mine. Of course, I avoid leaving it on the dash in the car in extreme heat or cold. I have a case to help protect in and to use as a stand. And, I'm careful not to put undue pressure on the device in any way. As far as resolution. The only thing that might be better is the iPad or iPods. But without Adobe Flash, you can't get the streaming video like You-Tube. And I've enjoyed using You-Tube too much to sacrifice it.I truly hope this is helpful.Walt B", "Date": "June 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Tablet for the Price", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RXOXQFG4W1SJF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I investigated tablets for a long time, trying to decide which one to get.  I finally narrowed it down to the Toshiba Thrive because of the external storage options.  I wanted a full size USB as well as SD card options.  This has both, as well as micro USB and the HDMI ports.  I use the USB port to hook up a USB expander and I hook up my keyboard, my mouse and when I use one--a flash drive.  I use the SD card slot as well.  I knew that I would be using my tablet like a laptop, so I wanted those options, that's why the other tablets didn't appeal to me.  I also like to have external storage, I don't like to be forced to save my data in a \"cloud\".  I got my tablet (the Toshiba Thrive 32gb) about a month ago, and I am so happy with it.  I have been able to do everything I wanted to so far.  I was thrilled with the idea of having a laptop-like device that could sync with my phone, therefore all of my apps, contacts, info. etc. was easily available on my tablet, literally within minutes I was up and running.  All I had to do was download my apps and voila--I could access all my \"stuff\" on either my tab or my phone.  I can print my docs wirelessly to my home printer as well.I must say, if you are like me--and want some control over your devices and their functionality--this is the way to go!  Each day I use my tablet more and more, it is so awesome, the functionality is great, and the big screen is great!  I don't even need my glasses to see it!  Bonus!!I haven't used the camera, as I keep my tablet in the faux leather keyboard case, so it's not really accessible, but let's face it, a 10 inch tablet is a little too big to be lugging around as a camera!  I use my phone for photos.As far as internet, I tether it to my phone's hot spot, it works exceptionally well.The tablet itself is a little heavy, and a little thicker than the newer models out there--this is because of the full size USB port I believe, but if you're looking for lightweight, you're gonna have to go with something newer and more expensive, but less flexible.  You just have to weigh your needs/wants in a tablet.  When using the tablet out of the case, it is really easy to hold on to because of the rubberized backing, you don't feel like it's gonna slip out of your hands.Honestly though, if you want something with all the port options this has, you will not be disappointed because all of its features measure up.A great buy for the money.

It's really hard to impress me that much. As such, the Thrive did. I've got it set up with the free Hacker Keyboard app to emulate a desktop keyboars when not using my Logitech Bluetooth keyboard, and use the PenGo stylus for drawing. Stellar experience any way. I'm typing this review using the keyboard app, as a matter of fact, and can type almost as fast as on a standard keyboard.Pros:- Great battery life. Don't know the hours measurement,but I use it almost contstantly every day and charge it at night. Charges in flash.- Works very well for taking notes, which is what I got it for. Plays games pretty well too, but that's not why I bought it.- Got a factory refurb and it looks and performs like new for $100 less- Protable, lightweight, easy to use- I can even do programming on it using a Terminal program, even ssh to the Computer Engineering servers to do my homework. With the Bluetooth keyboard, it might even be better at it than my 12\" HP tablet pc laptop.- Rotates all four directions... confused the heck out of my boyfriend for a few minutes :DCons:- Freezes occasionally. Fix this by just holding the power button until it shuts off and the LED blinks once, then power onas normal. Had to do this six or seven times so far.- Refused to boot after one of the above resets, but I just held the volume up key while powering on and cold-booted and it worked.- Sometimes when locked, the power button won't wake it, even with the lock slider set to off- Even on a 10\" screen, no soft keyboard will be comfortable enough for long periods of use. Get a Bluetooth keyboard. Trust me on this.- Not many cases for it that I like, but I'm picky. I wanted a silicone skin like I have on my phone, but that still allows use of the multimedia dock. No luck.- Fingerprint magnet. Solved by using a stylus, but that only works as long as you aren't typing on the screen.All in all though, I'm very impressed and the pros greatly outweight the cons in my mind.", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "AMAZING", "Author": "Tarjita", "ReviewID": "RI74T851H6V8W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "LOVE LOVE LOVE.

It was a refurbished unit and had a very attractive price of only $285 including shipping. The tablet is spotless and performs very well. I wasn't sure about buying a refurbished unit but am happy I did since it was only $285. That's about half the price of a 16GB iPad and $100 less than buying a new Thrive.Besides the low price, another reason I was really drawn to this unit was the ports: full USB, HDMI, SD card. I love that I can hook it up to my HD TV HDMI and stream anything from the internet to my TV. I also LOVE the full SD slot. That's a really useful feature for me. I can take digital photos with my digital SLR and then pop the SD card directly into the Thrive and start browsing my photos instantly. That's a HUGE feature if you're traveling and want to view your pictures on a larger screen and not have to lug around a laptop.I've had it for about 2 weeks now and am really loving it. I've downloaded tons of apps and they all work well except for a CNN app that seems to crash sometimes when I open a video. No big deal though as I have plenty of other news source apps to choose from.One little glitch I found early on was in the File Manager app. If you are browsing photos on an SD card, you cannot swipe the screen to flip between photos. If you tap the photo, a little toolbar appears at the bottom with a \"Play\" (slideshow) button, forward and backward arrows to browse to the next or previous photos. None of this works unfortunately. I called Toshiba and spoke to a nice woman who admitted the bug and said it's easily remedied by using the Gallery or the Media Player app. Using Gallery is my preferred method. The swiping and animation it shows as it flips to the next photo works perfectly as well as the slideshow feature. The only thing I don't like about this is you can't adjust the timing between photos in slideshow. The File Manager app had a timing slider from 3 - 10 seconds, however that didn't work of course.I wish the storage management options had a setting for storing pictures/videos taken from the device camera to the SD card instead of the system storage. My Blackberry has this option and it helps save a lot of memory.Another little glitch is that videos taken with my digital camera can't be played through either the Toshiba Media Player or the other video app that are installed by default. I had to locate a third party video player app on the Android Market and that works well. Don't know why the Toshiba apps can't play a simple .avi video from my camera, seems like a pretty basic expectation.I just received a nice cover case that I ordered from Amazon Moko(TM) Leather Folio Cover Case with Multi-Angle Stand for Toshiba Thrive 10.1-inch Android Tablet (BLACK) and also ordered and put a green back on Toshiba Thrive Colored Back Cover for 10.1-Inch Tablet - Green Apple (PA3966U-1EAG) . Both are really nice and work well. Word of warning though regarding the Moko case, it is NOT leather, it's a fake plastic leather but still very nice. Don't know how they get away with advertising it is real leather. It fits the unit perfectly though and I really love the multi-angle feature. You can adjust it just about any angle, as the bottom of the case has a small velcro strip and the inside of the case is the soft \"hooks\", so you can easily adjust it to any angle that works best, this is fantastic. I've seen other cases that have only 1 or two angle settings.I'm really happy with this device other than the minor bugs I've mentioned above.

This will be fun.I realize that I should have flushed out my intentions for my tablet B4 I jumped to purchase an iPad; however, I think I have found my DEVICE for MY purposes - to make property presentations and show properties via my website using my EVO HotSpot.Toshiba has an installed presentation package so I can load a powerpoint presentation for clients that I can then e-mail to them AND I have already downloaded the useful applications I have tested on my Acer like HotPads and Drudge as well as Firefox.So far....I am very happy with my device.If you are looking at Best Buy or another retail outlet, they are shipping in BLACK and then the COLOR cover is an AFTER market accessory like the standard and multi-dock as well as the various cases which can be purchased through Toshiba or from Amazon.I'm READY to start USING my Thrive, Mr. DeMille!", "Date": "December 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Terrific!!!!", "Author": "M.

It is the first tablet PC that I have ever owned,but I cannot see how I lived without it. It's easy to use, fast, and has a ton of Apps and things that you can do with it. Battery life is amazing also. I use the Thrive heavily everyday and only have to charge it every day and a half. It's not as heavy as some people say it is and the rubbery back keeps it from slipping out of my hands and off of the couch and tables. The screen is excellent and very hi-def. The main draw for me were the output connectors. The HDMI,USB,and SD card outs all work like a dream and do not need additional adapters to work.I watch YouTube,movies, and photos right on my HDTV with no hassell at all. Wi-Fi is great on it also.

My expectations were actually pretty low. I have messed around with various tablet devices for several years, and had yet to have a good experience. This tablet changes all of that. I love my iPhone and so I thought about an iPad but I don't need thousands of apps, nor do I need to be tied down to a specific software or service for multimedia content either. I also hate to pay big money for a crippled piece of hardware with no easy access to storage media.Back toi this Android tablet, first of all the hardware is amazing. The full size SD card slot works flawlessly, I have a 64gb card in there and I can store tons of movies, music and photos no problem. The USB port takes all of my USB flash drives as well as adapters for additional SD cards. That way, I can leave the internal SD card in there and still access photos on an SD card from my digital camera at the same time. The full size HDMI port and mini-usb to transfer data are usefull as well. The screen is great and the touch control is nearly perfect. The cameras are okay and work fine for Google Talk. I haven't tried to take any real photos yet, but I have a phone and camera for that anyway. The slight extra weight and thickness for such a full featured tablet is a no brainer, it is well worth the trade-off.Software is the other great thing, there are hundreds of apps, mostly free, to do just about anything you would want. One of the most amazing apps I have found is the ES File Manager. With this I can actually browse my windows shares on my network and copy files or even play movies and music directly with no special software or configuration. Another thing that blew me away was the included app to print to your networked printers. This also worked flawlessly, it is a trial, but I am definitely going to go ahead and pay for the full app.My only complaints are very nit-picky. The screen looks a little washed out, but only ever so slightly, just enough to be a tiny bit annoying, but not bad. In fact, if you fiddle with the brightness for any given ambient light it can look quite nice. I purchased a matte finish screen protector and that helped to boost the contrast slightly. Unfortunately, the screen protectors are very hard to apply and make text slightly soft. On the positive side, the screen protectors make the screen surface much more manageable in terms of not accumulating grease from your fingers and reducing glare. So, overall I think the matte finish screen protector is worth the few neagatives. As many have said, the power button is a little goofy, kind of hard to find and press, but once you get used to it, no big deal. Lastly, it does take a tiny bit of tech savvy to get around in the Android OS and get software to do just what you want, but nothing totally over the top either. I fully expected to have to root the device to get some of the capabilities I wanted but so far there has been an app for everything I would like to do with it. I did have to tweak ES File Manger to start from / so I could get to the mount point for the secondary SD Card but that took like two seconds, and very basic knowledge of file systems, so no biggie.Overall, I would highly recommend this tablet to anybody. If you want to get the maximum functionality from it, and you are not technically inclined, you may want to get a techie friend to help you tweak a few things. But, the out of the box experience is pretty amazing.", "Date": "December 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best tablet ever!", "Author": "SarahStG", "ReviewID": "R1OBBO0051AQJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My husband surprised me with this tablet, and after a week of constant use - I am in love.

I have not had the sleep issue that had been reported,While the Thrive is slightly thicker and heaver than most tablets, I don't find this to be a problem.  The wide band around the screen is actually a plus.  It allows for a better grip on the tablet as does the rubberized backThe tablet connects to Wi-Fi quickly.  No problems with traveling to a new location and selecting a new Wi-Fi.For a touch typing, touch screens are difficult. However the Thrive has voice recognition that works very well.  I now speak my email while the Thrive types it for me.  You must remember to have a slight pause between words.  Words that sound the same but spelled differently do confuse the tablet (to, too, two) and may need to be typed in.  Just like a smart phone, you need to check before you send.Tuning on maps brings up your current location.  I was pleased to find that voice recognition works with maps.  I was able to select maps; touch the microphone button and say \"Tampa, Florida\" and the map quickly appeared.  Then traveling to Central America I was pleased to find that it had the map of the small mountain town of Boquete, Panama.  It included locations of some important places.  My Garmin GPS did not have all the roads that were on the Thrive.  Why did I pay $150 for the inferior Garmin map?  It also has a digital compass that helps you navigate. I plan to try it out on other locations outside the USA and expect good results.Two problems:1. The cameras are on the middle left side when you hold the tablet in landscape mode.  This is right where you normally put your hand.  If the cameras were moved to the upper left it would make it perfect.2. I have a hard time getting the Thrive away from my wife.

In terms of functionality, I like having the flexibility of being able to remove the battery if necessary.

Sound very decent for a tablet. Many reviewers commented about the \"bulkiness\" of Toshiba Thrive, but I rather have a little bulkier and heavier tablet with everything on (USB, HDMI, SD card reader ports) than having separate adapters or dongles which is too much for me and even bulkier actually if we add those things together and not to mention we must purchase them separately. Ones that complaint a lot about the weight and the bulkier Toshiba Thrive should consider about the extra space and off course money on adapters or dongles that must be taken into the consideration and calculation and don't forget those extra gadgets can be lost easily as well.I have shopped around for any other tablets (Ipad2, Xoom, Samsung Galaxy Tab, Acer Iconia and Asus Transformer), then I decided that Toshiba Thrive is the chosen one.The best 4 things I like best with Thrive :1.

The update didn't cause any problems but I didn't have an files or apps installed. I don't know if would have required a total reset which may be problematic if you already have files installed. I seem to get 7 to 9 hours with the battery while watching netflix or reading books using the kindle app but I do have my screen brightness a bit lower than the default or the automatic setting. The battery charge time seems to be very quick, only about 35 to 40 min for a complete charge. I'm impressed with all the included ports but what really sold me was the removable battery. For that alone it makes the thrive a competitive tablet. I'm not a fan of Apple products since everything must function through itunes but many people don't consider the cost and time replacing something as simple as a battery when buying an apple product or some of the other android tablets. The included android 3.1 makes it easy to run third party apps and things such as keyboards and mice. Although few apps have been created to take advantage, the Thrives nvidia processor makes games and apps explode when it comes to graphics and speed. My only negative with the Thrive is the chrome bezel around the front facing camera. I feel it make the tablet look a bit cheap but it's only my opinion. I also hope they release an update that gives you the ability to turn off the front indicator lights. They can sometimes be too bright and distracting when reading or watching a movie.

I've enjoyed the interface and especially like the SD card slot and USB capabilities; I've already edited pictures shot on my A55V (JPG only); very handy while in the field. No issues so far, it's worked far better than the demo one I toyed with at a local store. There in lies the rub, however; what exactly does this do that a netbook cannot? Even an inexpensive laptop really, though battery-life becomes a concern there. Considering a Netbook with 2 gig of ram and a 320 gig HD is significantly less than the cost of any decent tablet, is the touch interface really worth the difference? Not convinced. The device has been great so far, battery life lasting much longer than the \"road-test reviews\". Also, complaints about the thickness are rather silly; There comes a point at which one of these would be too thin. One drop on an uneven surface and they'd crack. Perhaps they win the fashion competition but the Thrive would survive the torture tests.Great device, most issues are software-related which will likely be resolved via the 4.0 release soon.", "Date": "November 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Thank god I had this for my trip!", "Author": "Jay", "ReviewID": "R1B4MFYUQ9BRID", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought my thrive on release day (July 10th I think) and don't regret this purchase.

The portfolio case really protected the Thrive.Out of the 10 hotels/apartments we stayed in during the trip, only a few of them had Wi-Fi. We were able to surf the internet to plan out the next days of our trip and used Google Maps to find our way around the unexplored cities. I kept friends up to date on Facebook with what city we were in and pictures. This is by far the cheapest and best way to let friends and family know you are safe in another county!We took (6) 4G SD cards with us for pictures. When all 6 SD cards were full, I would insert the SD cards into the Thrive and dump the pictures onto it, then reuse the SD cards.

I haven't owned or used other tablets so the weight of about 26 ounces is not a big deal.Day 1 - Received Thrive -- I am tech oriented and like the Android system (Own Droid X).  Thrive was packaged very securely with a quick Start guide that I didn't have to use.  I plugged the Thrive, turned it on, and made a few basic settings to get started.  The home screen and apps took about 5 minutes to figure out.  The system keeps track of your recently used Apps and returning to a web page or app almost instantly is a great function.  The Thrive recognized my home WIFI and connected without problems.  I registered the Thrive with Toshiba and signed up for update notifications and received Google Maps and Thrive system update.  I hooked up my logitech wireless mouse and instantly worked - no menu choices or setup required.  Decided to try the video HDMI connection and actually used Amazon Prime Free Video.  I connected the HDMI port to my 52\" Sony TV and the screen of the Thrive immediately was displayed on the TV - no setup, menus, or configuration of any kind.  I went to Amazon and pulled up the Yellowstone Park Video.  The video screen said \"not optimized for mobile\" but when I clicked on the \"popout\" (not really sure what that means) option on Amazon Video Player my TV screen was filled with the video.  I had a bar across the top with Amazon stuff because I was playing video from the Amazon Internet page.  The picture was great!!  Because I was displaying the movie from Amazon's Internet player I had to click on the display options for about a minute to get the best picture (popout option).  I controlled the video from across the room with the wireless mouse and even used the mouse to fill in the search box by clicking on the keyboard letters to find additional movies.  The video was a little choppy (not enough to interfere with enjoyment)...probably because my wireless router is G and not N (much faster).  I then played a Family Guy episode from a previous purchase on Amazon and it worked without ANY problems.....absolutely cool on how easy this thing is to use.  Hell, even the keyboard on the display is very nice size for my fat fingers.  Total use of the Thrive on day 1 was about 4 hours.Pros:  Unbelievable easy to use - I am sure having Android phone helped becuase of Settings.  Internet access, ability to jump back to previous web pages and apps almost instantly (two taps) is great.  Battery after 4 hours of playing around was still at 58%.Cons:  Keyboard sometimes had a delay when typing - I am not a typist - bothersome keying in search phrases.I gave the review 4 stars instead of 5 because of only 4 hours usage.I will add additional reviews later today after I add other email accounts and look at Excel, Word, PDF, and Power Point documents on it.

Toshiba should be promoting this better...it's quite innovative for an android tablet. No, it's not as thin as an iPad. It's about a quarter of an inch thicker and a quarter of a pound heavier.  I think I can deal with that little extra size because of all you get for it.  The biggest selling point for me was the user-swappable battery.  I can't believe it has taken this long for some manufacturer to include that!  When the battery won't hold a charge anymore I don't have to ship it back to the manufacturer to have the battery changed, and wait who knows how long to get it back.The other thing that sets this apart from other tablets is the inclusion of all the ports:  there's a full-size SD card slot, full-size USB port, mini-USB port and an HDMI port.  The small hard drive size is no problem at all since it takes up to a 132 GB SD card.  The included file manager makes it so much easier to access your own files, which isn't always easy on an android device.  Of course it's a touch screen, and it does have pinch zoom/multi-touch.  I didn't even know it included a Swype keyboard, but am thrilled that it does.  I hardly miss a keyboard unless I'm doing LOTS of typing.  For that, it can accommodate a bluetooth keyboard if you wish.It's so personalizable you can swap out the back cover for the color cover of your choice.

I'm quite happy with the Thrive, but it's not quite an iPad. Then again, the iPad is not quite a Thrive, either.Overall, the iPad conveys more of a feeling of luxury. It's made of metal, while the Thrive feels cheaper and more plastic-y. Its animations are always smooth, while the Thrive sometimes feels a bit clunky. But that's really all I have to say about the Thrive's downsides.After using it with the installed Honeycomb for a few days, I found it could be upgraded all the way to Ice Cream Sandwich. That's a pretty nice OS, the second-most-recent Android version, with most, if not all, of the features any tablet owner could want. It's fairly slick, too.The main reasons I bought the Thrive are because it has a user-replaceable battery and because it has ports and slots for USB devices and memory cards. The iPad has none of these; when your iPad stops holding a charge, you're expected to send it off to Apple and pay a fairly hefty wad of cash to get a refurbished model in exchange. When the battery dies on the Thrive, you replace it with a battery that costs around $20-25, the last I looked.The Thrive does everything I ever did with the iPad.Bottom line -- while the iPad may be slicker, the Thrive is a great tablet that I expect to enjoy long after the battery on my old iPad has finally quit.", "Date": "February 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good features BUT not durable..", "Author": "Roitan C Angeles", "ReviewID": "RWMTQCTJO9P6X", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this product a year ago because it has better (if not the best) features than most of the other well known tablets...and of course it's Toshiba.

The box had \"reconditioned\" label on it and the 90-days warranty documentation with the rest of the contents, in my opinion these are the only differences between the new Tablet and the \"refurbished\" or \"reconditioned\" one.

I have had my 10.1\" 32GB Thrive for a little over 2 months and cannot say enough good things about it.I read a previous comment that the persons Thrive was slow but that must be a rare Thrive as mine is fast fast fast! I also cannot say enough about the capabilities this awesome tablet gives you. With all it's ports etc. If you need more, you don't need this tablet, you need a clunky laptop!Another feature with this tablet seldom mentioned or even known about is the fact that you can also buy a USB Ethernet adaptor and hookup this tablet to the internet when there is no WIFI available. Several adaptors are available that work don't require a driver, so it's as simple as plugging in the USB adaptor and plugging the cable into the adaptor. Try doing that with an iPad!If you feel you can't live without a real keyboard or mouse, they also work on this tablet, just plug in the USB or use Bluetooth. I thought I would want to use a keyboard but after a few minutes on the qwerty keypad, I knew I didn't need or want an external keyboard! This tablet just does it all!I found that I liked using a \"stylus\" pen, I didn't think I would but it became easy and natural to use. The reason I started with a stylus is because it gave me pinpoint accuracy when selecting on the screen, I have large fingers and I got tired of always enlarging the screen so I wouldn't be sent off to links I had no intention of going to. I'm a fairly decent typist so I thought using a stylus would be a fuss because I would always be putting the stylus down when I type, but what I found is when I type, I just use the stylus in my right hand and use my left naturally and I fly!I just hooked up my tablet to our HDTV via it's full size HDMI port a couple of days ago and was amazed by the picture. I was watching some YouTube HD videos and the picture was like I was watching a Bluray video and we don't have a Blueray sytem! I also ran the sound back through our home theater system so between the HD and sound, this little Tablet is just a giant killer. Forget the iPad and it's limited capabilities....If you want a tablet that does it all, here it is.There has been some criticism about it's weight etc. but if you can't handle a few more ounces in weight, perhaps a 7\" tablet would work better for you. The Thrive also has a full size SD card slot (I have a 32GB in mine but it can take up to a 64GB). So if you're looking for a tablet that has memory capabilities...32GB/System+64GB/SD Card+64GB/USB = A lot of potential onboard memory for a tablet!After using the Thrive for a couple of weeks, my wife decided she wanted her own, so off to the local store I went and was lucky enough to get the same unit on clearance for substantially less than what I paid. Luckily I brought along my own receipt and got a refund on mine to match the clearance price on my wifes tablet ~ Sweet!Lastly, No, I do not work for Toshiba! My wife and I are retired so when I find something that works really well for the money, I like to share my own thoughts.Update: 7/9/12....I should also add that we also added a free Kindle App which has turned our Thrives into our libraries. There are tens of thousands of great free books online besides those found here on amazon, such as internetarchives.org...I have downloaded great books from that site right into my kindle App very easily, just click where it says \"Kindle\" in the box to the left side of the page. Can't get much better than being a Thriver Driver!7/10/12 ~ Another plus...I bought a leather \"rooCase\" for my Thrive here on Amazon for a total cost of $10.06 including delivery! Some reviews on this case indicate that it leaves a black mark on the back of the Tablet but since I have the standard black Thrive cover, no problem for me even if it does.This cover is extremely thin and fits the Thrive perfectly, all the openings and areas fit perfectly plus it is extremely lightweight. Just do a search on Amazon for \"Thrive rooCase\" and it will come up. Then go to \"2 New\" offers. I chose the $5.08 + $4.98 shipping)since I'm not a Amazon prime member. I also have the official Thrive cover with the 360 degree swivel for landscape or portrait viewing but I found that it did not sit well on the lap in the landscape mode but makes a great, very sturdy travel case.I searched on the internet and found a Red leather case for my wife's Thrive which cost $35. I found her case doing a Google search where a lady in Texas had one listed on Craigslist! I called the lady, asked about the case and if she would ship to Nevada, she was great.

I love the ports and SD card slot as well (my main reason for purchasing). I just took this on a trip to NY and loaded up movies on an SD card for the plane trip, transferred pictures from my camera's SD card to the internal memory to give me more picture space, and transferred files from one SD card to another using a USB adapter for the 2nd card. Heck, if I wanted to, I could have hooked it up to the hotel TV via HDMI. For those that say the ports are outdated, I just used all of them in one weekend trip, and I wouldn't have been able to do what I needed to do any other way! The battery lasted about a day and a half after my 3 hour plane trip with movies playing via SD the entire time, some WiFi surfing in the hotel room, and transferring my files.

I was new to the tab world and like most people all I had really heard about was iPad this and that. Granted the iPad is a nice, thin product but it limits a user who is looking for a tab to use as a laptop stand-in. That's what I love about the Thrive, it has so many ports that u can hook a many accessories to it, ie. Keyboard, mouse, HD TV. To top that off, Toshiba a gives you an SD card slot that makes the memory aspect of this tab limitless.Now the Thrive is a little thicker and bulkier than the iPad, but what do you expect when they've given you these expansion possibilities. Apple makes you BUY all these adapters if you want to be able to hook up external devices.Let me say a few words about the bluetooth feature. It's great! I have been able to download files from my computer and phone so easily. The Office Pro app is so wonderful to use to look and edit you MS Office documents.  Speaking of apps, I have an Android market phone and when I set up my Thrive it automatically downloaded the same apps I had on my phone. That was a real time saver.I have my tab in a portfolio that has a built in keyboard. Typing on the screen is better than typing on my phone, but I still like the feel of an actual key. The keyboard did take a little time to get used to because it's smaller than a laptop keyboard, but what a great combo to have a portfolio cover with a keyboard at ur disposal. Which, by the way, props up the tab to give you the look and feel of a laptop.??????The only reason I did not give the Thrive a 5 is because it is a little chunkier, but if thats the worst con of this product then we're in great shape. I would HIGHLY reccomend that you purchase a stylus because they make navigation more efficient and helps keep those annoying fingerprints off the screen.I enthusiastically reccomend this tab to someone who is in the market for one.

I purchased screen protectors when buying this tablet but I have not need to use them yet since the original screen film/protector that the tablet came with works great, it's durable & bubble-free... (I just carefully cut the tiny peel-off tab from the bottom-left corner of the film & also scratched off the big TOSHIBA logo in the middle of the film, the rest of the writing around the borders came off on its own in about a month...)  & I got a good priced Belkin neoporene case for the tablet for carrying in my bag which works great...UPDATE Jan 2013:After a little over a year of frequent use but with good handling, the tablet proved to be not as rugged as it appeared.  One corner of the tablet rim (the frame part b/t the screen & the back cover) chipped off (about 1/2 inch) which I crazy-glued back on.  Also, I'm starting to notice some extra give of the tablet rim from the back body of the tablet, like it's un-gluing apart; hopefully I can get at least another year of life with this tablet before it falls apart totally.  The rugged look of this tablet is definitely deceiving.  My friend's I-pad that are rough handled by their toddlers are holding up strong even after 2 years.  I also upgraded my tablet to ICS, & soon afterwards the tablet was not charging, but when I took the battery out & reset the tablet, it charged up fine again.  Other then these problems, the tablet still works well, but I will remove 1 star from my original rating b/c the tablet's physical body is not as durable as expected.", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great tablet", "Author": "mary78664", "ReviewID": "R3IVMWKMNXQGPJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great Android tablet for the price.

Browsing the internet is a breeze.", "Date": "January 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Works like a charm, even better than iPad", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Cool C\"", "ReviewID": "RJ5UPG1AJVJNI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In the past year, I ventured into the tablet world and purchased 1 iPad 2, 3 Kindle Fires, 1 Nook Color and Toshibe Thrive 16GB.  At any given time, my household have all these tablets charged.So, with these tablets to compare with, I can say I'm qualified to give a subjective review for Toshiba Thrive.I did not purchase this new.  I actually got mine from Woot (an Amazon reseller) for $100 less.  I bought a refurbished unit and received it in a week time.  On opening the product, it looked surprisingly new.  Toshibe really did a good job in refurbishing the unit.Power AdapterThe first thing that I did was to charge the battery.  Usually all electronics come with a battery half-full.  Toshiba neglects to do so.  The battery is totally empty and I couldn't turn it on.  It comes with the regular \"brick\" power adapter.  Unlike other USB chargers, this power adapter fully charged the Thrive in less than 2 hours.  The USB chargers for Kindle Fire and iPad takes 3-4 hours to be fully charged.User InterfaceToshiba Thrive is very responsive.  Loaded with Honeycomb 3.1, it is a pleasure to work with.  Everything is highly customizeable.  My wife's iPad environment is so closed sometimes I feel handicapped.  The Kindle Fires OS is also a closed environment but for my kids, it is perfect.  Nook Color is crap.  One thing I do not like is the power button.  It is located on the top right and it is very hard to depress.  At times, I press the volume rocker instead of the power button.AppsGoing into Android MarketPlace is seemless.  I was able to load Amazon AppStore without any trouble.  The first thing I did was to install Skype, Netflix and Anti-Virus software.  Android is a virus mecca, you can go very wrong if you install the wrong apps.I loaded Netflix and some of the videos did stutter.  Not sure why.  I tried some game apps they worked very well.  I especially like \"Where's My Water\" from Amazon AppStore.CameraThe cameras for the back and front are very week.  Taking pictures using these cameras produce very grainy photos.  I honestly don't understand the reason to have cameras beside making Skype calls.  So this is not a big deal.ExpansionsComparing to all the tables that I have, Toshiba Thrive is surely a winner.  SD card, USB port, HDMI output are excellent.  After we took some digital photos using our Canon SLR, I can quickly view them using my Thrive.  The Thrive produces very sharp photos.  Sure beats the needs to turn on my PC to download photos.  I cannot do any of these on the iPad, Nook Color or Kindle Fire.Build QualityThe entire unit looks solid and very well made, even for a refurbished unit.  The only thing I don't like is the back cover, which can be detached.  When I hold the back, I could feel it flexes, which gives the feeling of \"don't break it\".  The Thrive is the thickest among all the tablets that I have.  I plan to use it to do quick view of the web and some entertainment through the web.  I am using Thrive to replace all the Windows laptops that I have.  The thickness is not a deal breaker.I love this tablet for the price and its functionality.  I hate Windows.  Anything that I can use to replace Windows is fine with me.  That brings up the next point, you will never see me buy another Window laptop or Window tablet.Update March 21, 2012I bought this refurbished Thrive.  One thing I found out was it cannot be updated due to the wrong image that was installed.  This is a common problem for all refurbished Thrives.Also, Toshiba Thrive also turns on by itself for no apparent reason.  I searched the web and found out that this is a common problem with no clear solutions.Update May 10, 2012Toshiba had a push update on the Thrive.  There was an image update dated September.  For some reason I couldn't update my Thrive.  So I tried the image updated dated October.  That seemed to work.  Finally, another image update dated March finally update my thrive to Android 3.2.  I could tell that my Thrive is a lot speedier.  Will this fix the \"auto\" turn on problem.

My main use was going to be for travel, I wanted to have something with me that could get on the internet and had a larger screen than my smart phone. I say \"was\" because I find myself picking it up to use instead of walking over to my computer. This product is perfect, it has a large clear screen, it's lightweight and I picked up how to use it right away.  The only complaint that I have regarding the product is the power cord, I would think that such a small device would have a small cord but it reminds me of a mini computer power cord even with a box in the middle of the cord.  Annoying when your trying to pack one carry on bag and you already have a bunch of other cords and clothes along.  I guess that if this was the only complaint that I have, it must be a good product right?One other issue that I'm putting here as well as a complaint to Amazon, that has already been filed, is about the shipping.  The product was ordered on Jan 11 and I received it on the 14th using their standard shipping, great turn around and not the problem!!  What was unfortunate was that whatever company did the shipping knocked on the door and then left my package on the doorstep.  I live in an apartment complex, had I not been home (there was no way for them to know I was) I doubt that package would have still been there by the time I got back.  When the tablet was left, my apartment leasing office was open (they always accept packages) and I do even have a patio that they could have dropped it on.  I just want others to be aware that you might want to track your package and try to make sure someone is home so the same issue doesn't happen to you.", "Date": "January 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Thrive Beats Them All", "Author": "Dale L.

As other reviewers have pointed out, a few things stood out to me with the toshiba.  First, I like the inputs it has. The full HDMI and usb ports made it nice, with the bonus of a full size SD card.  I like it because i can swap SD cards from my cameras and computers quickly to my tablet, without any messing with transfering to the micro SD and hunting down the adapter.

I have had my notebook battery die and thankfully i can replace it, and my cell phone batteries never last much more than 2 years or less, so i have replaced them.

Don't waste your time signing up for their book site. The big problem is lack of apps for tablets. I know there will be more soon but even apps that work on my phone won't work on this tablet (facebook), you have to use the web site.

It is well-priced, has horse-power aplenty, and is the most compatible with your existing electronics (being one of two tablets that have native USB and HDMI support). The design choice is more bulky than the Galaxy Tab or iPod, but this is rewarding as it allows for both a removable battery (to extend the life-expectancy of your device) and makes the Tablet sturdier.The Thrive runs Android 3.1 and is updated by Toshiba. iOS does have more Apps than Android, but that is changing all the time. I find Android extremely functional and have had no problems with it. I never found myself wanting any Apps that weren't available on the Android Market either.Battery life is good, boot-time is fast, and the microphone is superb.

Battery life and the charge-up time are as Toshiba announced (aprox 9hrs/1hr).Toshiba released an update tryin to fix the sleep bug but its not really satisfactory as this fix simply shuts down the wifi receiver. you can't listen to some music stream or have something downloaded with the screen off.

Plenty of ports so you can connect anything you may want. I used it mainly as a viewer.reader for my camera's SD card.

Pre-ordered the Thrive June 13th, the first day it was eligible for pre-order. Also, I love Toshiba as a company. With that out of the way..The Thrive is a fantastic device. I haven't read any of the other reviews, so I'm probably going to repeat what they've said, but oh well. Starting with the physical device:- The screen is very responsive and slick, although you will notice finger prints after minor-moderate use (I notice mine after a couple hours of playing games), but that's to be expected from any touch-based device. They wipe away cleanly and easily with a cloth.- While people seem to say that the device is heavy and bulky, I disagree. I think that the size is perfect, and I have had no problem with my arms getting tired after (literally) holding the device for hours without setting it down (side note: it is a great enough device to want to use it for hours at a time without setting it down.)- The standard hardware set (Tegra 2 processor, 10.1\" screen, 1 GB RAM) works very well with Gingerbread (Android 3.1 OS). Everything is responsive and I've had no issues with the device being too slow or getting overloaded (and I have not overclocked the processor yet.)- One of my favorite features are the ports: full USB, mini USB, and full size HDMI. The USB supports keyboards, flash drives/external hard drives formatted under FAT (a future OS update will likely support NTFS, as well.) The HDMI port allows me to very easily hook the Thrive up to my HDTV, which I do every night to watch some shows online to fall asleep.- The contours on the back of the case make holding the tablet feel natural and easy. The extra grip keeps the Thrive from slipping from your hands (I've had mine since July 13th, and have not dropped it once.)- The battery lasts for approximately 7 hours of continuous use (roughly), although I haven't had any problems with the battery life. Even if I did, it charges to 90% in an hour. However, in order to do that, the Thrive (unlike, I assume, every other tablet on the market) charges with an AC adapter, like a laptop, rather than through a USB connection. So you need a power outlet or a car adapter to charge it, rather than just a USB connection, but in my opinion the super fast charging makes it worth it.- The 16 GB version I have, plus the 16 GB (full size) SD card means that I basically have as much space as I can possibly ever need. (Be careful with SD cards; some require a little hack to get them to work on the Thrive/PC, which requires taping over a small hole in the card. Google it if you have any problems; takes minutes to fix and causes no problems.)On the software side:- The android market has responded very well to Android 3.0/3.1, thanks to the Xoom and Tab leading the pack by a couple of months, putting many great games and apps out there to keep you entertained.- While there are many great apps that are compatible with the device, the reality is that this is not Apple and what works on one device won't necessarily work on another. You will have apps that (randomly) force close, and ones that you can't even install on the device because a company (see: HBO and Hulu) refuse to give you the option to get it to work yourself until they develop an app specifically for that OS and device.- Android 3.1 runs very smoothly with almost no hiccups. The setup of the home screens allows you to place hundreds of apps/widgets across the huge screen, although it does currently lack the ability to create folders. While there aren't really any reasons you need to create a folder since you have plenty of space on the home screens, I find it a bit odd that it doesn't even give you the option.- The included Toshiba File Manager is fantastic. I've used it to browse the internal HD as well as the SD card, and I find myself using it almost daily to clear up downloads and folders that like to stick around after an app is uninstalled (unfortunately, some apps still do that. Hoped that would end once you get off the PC, but what can you do.)- The Toshiba App Place is an interesting app to find some properly developed and supported applications, but it's still very sparse and almost everything has to be paid for. Additionally, the interface for it is fairly clunky, most apps don't have photos of the app in use (just a logo that is bannered across the top and an icon for the app), and they are oddly subscription based ($9.99/month) rather than a one-time fee.Problems/bugs/glitches:- One of the main problems (which, allegedly, is going to be fixed next week) is a sleeping bug. When you turn the device \"off\" (push the power button once to black the screen, or let it sit for a few minutes and it does it itself) it actually enters a low-power sleep state. Sometimes, randomly, when you go to wake it up, it just doesn't wake up. The LED lights up like it's on, but the screen stays black and requires a hard restart to be operational again.- To my surprise, Toshiba has locked down the device a fair amount. For most users, this isn't likely a problem. However, I would like to uninstall some of the bloatware (included software that does nothing but take up space and annoy you, usually running in the background) and to run a custom version of Flash so that I can watch Hulu videos (one of the most important uses for a tablet, in my opinion), but Toshiba does not permit the user to uninstall the application, and it can't just be overridden. Although, many of the folders are hidden as they are considered \"system\" folders, which disallows you from editing some of the files for certain applications (if the app wasn't made to run on 3.1 and needs a little tweak, why can't I just edit a config file and do it myself?).- To continue with the above, rooting the Thrive is still in its infancy. The above wouldn't be much of a big deal if I could just root my device, get superuser access, and just do what I want on the device, but that is currently not an option (well, not unless you want to run the risk of soft-bricking your device (someone had said that since all the editing is done from the boot manager, it can't actually be fully bricked, but you can end up wiping the stock ROM, making it unable to be used for anything until you install a new one or recover the old one.)It might sound like that are a fair amount of negatives with the device, but it's much easier to point out what doesn't work than what does work. And overall, the Thrive works amazingly. It's by far been my best purchase in the past 12 months, if not longer. If you're looking for an android tablet that works great and has one of the best companies behind it, the Thrive is for you. I have a roll up USB keyboard that I can just pack with me wherever I go. Set the Thrive up on a stand, plug in the keyboard, and I basically have an ultra-portable computer/gaming device/web browser/movie and TV show viewer. All in all, I would give the Thrive a 4.8 if I could, but because of some current issues am forced to round it down to a 4. That being said, if you purchase the Thrive, you will not be disappointed.", "Date": "July 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Update issues, but otherwise quite enjoyable", "Author": "Mitch10 \"mitch10\"", "ReviewID": "R1FC4LMM193G30", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I pre-ordered on Amazon so got the Thrive on July 11.  Overall, I am very pleased and won't repeat in detail all the merits of the tablet but instead briefly describe what I especially like and a couple of faults that prevent me from giving it 5 full stars.On the plus side; I use a usb keyboard for taking notes in meetings but found I can semi-touch type on-screen with the tablet on a table; this was an unexpected surprise.  Dolphin HD browser works great and very much like a laptop experience in terms of rendering and speed.  I've even streemed some movies from Amazon with total stupefaction.  If I'm using the Thrive for checking email, light surfing and a game or two, the battery will last a full 2 days. Documents and PDFs render quite nicely on the Thrive and I can even work in spreadsheets comfortably.Now for the 2 quibbles. Sometimes applications will shut down unexpectedly.  This most likely is app-specific Honeycomb issues, but there's no way to know for sure just yet.  Second and worse.  Although it's nice to have regular OS updated due to having stock Honeycomb 3.1, the last one came with the dreaded \"narcolepsy\" syndrome.  I.e. it doesn't always wake from sleep without a hard reboot.  This only stared after the second update.  I have no doubt that Toshiba will fix it soon, but till then it is annoying to wait 30-40 seconds while it boots up.UPDATE; I've been using the new update that fixed the narcolepsy.  It did the trick, but unfortunately did not fix other issues.  I'm leaving the rating at 4 stars.ISSUES1. The tablet still wakes itself up for no apparent reason.  Yesterday it was doing it quite often and it drained the battery quite fast.2. I'm having trouble hot swapping SD cards.  I find that I nearly always have to reboot to get it to recognize a card.  I don't have that issue with other Android devices.3. I still have problems with some programs including Market shutting themselves down while other like Flash just stop working altogether.  I'm not sure if that's due to the hardware or just Gingerbread.4. Unlike the Galaxy tab and my LG Android phone, I don't see a way to clear all notifications.  I have to clear each one manually which is annoying.PLUSES1. Videos play even better; I enjoy streaming content to the Thrive!2. I purchased a second battery and it makes it even easier to take anywhere.3. I found that reading email from the Thrive is actually easier than from a computer.  I read several accounts daily and K9-Mail as well as Kaiten Mail work wonderfully!4. The Thrive hasn't had any issues picking up wifi signals on several networks.

The full size USB and SD slots basically give it 80gb of capacity. (32gb SD + 16gb USB)The only complaint I've really heard is that it's too fat and heavy, but for me, that's a non-issue. It weighs like 1.6 lbs. Are you seriously complaining about the weight of a computer that's less than two pounds? Sure, there are thinner, lighter ones out there, and if that's what you want, by all means, get a Galaxy Tab. They're pretty sexy... but personally, I'll take the bulk if it means I can easily copy anything I want to a USB stick and have it instantly on my tablet... and I can just copy 30gb worth of music onto an SD card and just throw it in..I honestly don't even know how you're supposed to get stuff onto an iPad. iTunes?

User friendly OS, easy setup and fast app switchingBesides all those I have some cons about this:- Problem waking up from hibernation (fixed in new patch)- No way of killing any individual process / opened app. \"Task manager\" will become longer as you open more apps.  It's fast and good when you're switching between them.- Power plug to tablet is sticking out about 2\". It's in the way in some cases.

It doesn't recognize .flv file format but it's ok after installing third party player.

Over the past six months I had narrowed it down to an ASUS or Samsung and was nearly certain that I was getting a Transformer. Then last month I read a little more about the Thrive on Amazon (pre-launch); and the SD card, USB(s), battery, and HDMI out convinced me to give it a shot. I've had it now for 3 weeks and could not be happier. I have not found a single issue with the Thrive. I wish there were more apps for Android tablets, but I am patient. The only time I've had anything remotely annoying is when I tried 3 different launcher apps and they all crashed the tablet. I finally just decided to go without a launcher (for the record, Launcher Pro, ADW, and Go launcher all crashed the tablet HARD, often after a screen timeout) and the default set up is ok for now. For my money Launcher Pro is the best on the market and I'll wait until it is more stable for the Thrive before reinstalling.

Here's why I returned it and bought the Asus Transformer, which I think is a much better device.When I got it I was very excited.  However, shortly after playing with it I started having the dreaded not come out of sleep issue.  At first I thought it was the live wallpaper I was using.  I removed it and it locked up less often.  Then Toshiba sent an update and things got so bad that it locked up almost every time it went to sleep. Finally I followed the recommendation that someone on the web had which was don't let the wifi sleep.  That helped but it still locked up every now and then.  After having the issues I started to regret my purchase and other things started to bother me, like the cheap build quality, how thick it was, how dim the screen was and how quick the battery died.  I eventually returned it and bought the Asus Transformer.  All I have to say is I'm extremely happy with my decision.  I love the transformer.  The build quality is way above the Thrive, the screen is way more bright and has better viewing angles. It's thinner and here's the big one, has had no problems at all.  I love it and I just order the keyboard dock as well.  Oh yeah, it lasts way longer too.  Do yourself a favor, if you're looking at the Toshiba then take a pass and get the Transformer.  You won't regret your decision.I do have to give Toshiba credit for trying to work with me though.  They tried resolving the issues I had and eventually said I could return it.

I am a salesman who sells technical products to industrial users and my goal is to use the tablet as a presenter and to keep track of the volumes of literature, images and video that I use.  My needs are: Great graphics, snappy response, one-touch finding stored literature like pdf's and images and simple ease of use.  The Thrive is very capable of doing all of these, however the problem at the moment seems to be the lack of apps for the Honeycomb 3.1 OS.  There is not good launcher right now for Honeycomb--at least not on the level of the GoLauncher that I use on my android phone.  One must access files via a file manager and then click to open.  I am hoping to be able to put shortcuts on my home screen and click to open--can't do that now.  However, it is amazing what developers are doing and the creativity is impressive. It is just a matter of time before the developers catch up.I am very pleased with the tablet.  The SD card slot feature is so important for easy file management and flexibility.  The screen is great. Battery life is good. It feels robust.  Many of the other reviewers have done an outstanding job of listing features so I won't get into that.  However, I would like to save you some time regarding apps. If you decide to buy this tablet and you use it for sales or communicating ideas to others, the apps can make all the difference in the world.  Here are my favorites.1.  PDF Reader.  ezPDF Reader.  This is an example of what an elegant PDF reader can be.  Simply outstanding.2.  File Manager.  ES File Explorer. I need to be able to find files quickly and accurately.  This helps me do that.3.  Image viewer.  The two best that I have found are QuickPic and Just Pictures.  Both are good and easy way to organize your pics.4.  Office.  There are several good ones, I settled on ThinkFree Office because it is $5 cheaper.  Works fine.5.  Keyboard.  There is nothing like Thumb Keyboard.  This is a must.  I love this keyboard.6.  Video Player.  Nothing is worse than opening a video to show your customer your great solution and the sound is blaring or you can't hear it.  MX Video Player has gesture volume control and brightness that you can easily adjust upside down while your customer/presentee is holding the tablet.7.  Of course Kindle and Audible are musts if you are on the road a lot. Love them both.8.  I don't use the camera on this.  Get a Canon PowerShot S95 10 MP Digital Camera with 3.8x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3.0-Inch inch LCD. You will not regret it.9.  Dropbox.  This is hands-down the best program ever invented.I am an early adopter for business and I believe that Thrive is the best choice for that.  I can get email on my phone and hotspots are plentiful so I don't really need broadband on this.  The only thing that I am really wishing for is a good launcher app.  I do hate the power cord that came with the unit--pain in the butt.  However, I am looking forward to the joy of not lugging pounds of literature around, while having all that I need available in my Thrive.

The criticisms I have for this tablet will all probably be fixed at some point, so none of them is fatal to my view.  I'm also not going to recount the many, well-stated and exhaustive points others have better made. These are more in the category of observations:First thing, this is a really solid tablet, but it is not perfect.  It's pretty fast, responsive, and all the rest.  I don't think you will be disappointed with it if you choose to buy it.  But just know you will not be any taller, smarter, or better looking wth this tablet over any other.  You will be around $500 poorer but hopefully you view this as entertainment and not identity.  I give it 4 stars because I think 4 stars is its fair grade, and that is still well above average.This gives me a chance to go on a tangent about our so-called \"5-star\" fixated culture, where we expect everything to be perfect.  Growing up here I didn't know anybody who had a 5-star anything, and we had it relatively good.  No 5-star houses, no 5-star cars, vacations, marriages, or kids.  But we were happy.  Now it seems, if things aren't labeled five-star, there's something wrong with them.  But that label is misleading.  There's a lot of subjectivity going into any appraisal.  Nothing in our society (nothing) is five-star for long.  Four stars is about as good as it gets, and that is excellent in my book.Okay, now back to the tablet.  I like it.  It looks good, touch screen is responsive, and you can tweak the speakers to sound decent.  I think you'll want to get a bluetooth mouse and keyboard if you plan on writing anything longer than a short email.  Get a case for it if you plan to take it out.  It's huge and bulky but it will survive a crash.  My GF and I joke that I am going to get \"my owner's manual\" when I bring mine.  If you own a newer car, you'll soon know why.  The filing system still confuses me; I cannot locate 10 albums' worth of files either on internal or external storage, though it is clearly located on the external card.  Amazon, but not the native Toshiba player, locates them.Finally (for now), for those using the phrase \"IPad Killer,\" we first have to define what that means.  If it means that somebody produces a tablet that is better than the IPad, then, yes, I think this is probably it.  I have used one a fair bit over the months.  Overall, I think this is the more capable tablet.  But if we mean that someone will make a tablet that will outsell the IPad, then, no, this is not it, an none of the others will be, either.  Why?  Because Apple sells \"the experience,\" not productivity, connectivity, or interoperability.  If you disagree, fine, but then you have  to explain why anyone hasn't  created an \"IPod killer\"?  Certainly, better MP3 players exist and Apple's restrictive use with multiple computers is a clear and vexing criticim.  But no one yet has figured out how to compete with Mr.Jobs and Co. because they are desperately trying to match Apple on the technicalspecs, and that is not what sells anything.

I  had recently returned a Motorola Xoom because I got tired of waiting for Motorola to activate the microSD card slot.  When looking for a replacement, the features listed for the Thrive made it seem too good to be true.  Full sized SD-card slot?  Yes!  Removable back-cover and battery!  Yes!  Full sized USB port and HDMI-out?  Double yes!When I got the thing in my hands, I thought (at first) that I had definitely made the right choice.  While the Thrive is actually heavier than the Xoom, it was better balanced and had a nice grippy back, so it *felt* lighter and more comfortable to hold.I noticed, however that it would occasionally not wake up from it's sleep status when the power button was pushed, requiring a hard-reset.  And it would occasionally just reboot itself.  This happened a couple of times so I gave Toshiba support a call.  The gentleman I spoke with suggested a factory reset.  I hadn't installed that many apps on the tablet yet, so I did so.  Of course, the original problem was not a constant thing, so I thanked him for his help and hung up.Five minutes later, it repeated the problem.  Wouldn't wake up from sleep, requiring a hard reset.  I called Toshiba again.  This time, I was told that what was needed was to remove the back cover (not easy to do) and take the battery out for a few minutes.  I did so and, again, the problem didn't present itself right away, so I assumed it was fixed.Wrong.  Five minutes later, and it was repeating the same problems, so I made the decision to return it to Amazon.  In 24 hours of ownership, the tablet refused to wake-up (requiring a hard reboot) at least a dozen times.  It also rebooted itself 3 or 4 times.This product is less than half-baked.  I refuse to believe that this problem didn't present itself during testing and Toshiba should be ashamed for releasing this tablet to market.At some point, someone will release a tablet with all of the features that the Toshiba Thrive boasts, except that one will actually work.  When that tablet comes out, it will be worth looking at. But stay away from the Thrive.  You will only be disappointed.Personally, I guess I'll go back to the Xoom.

By having a Google phone number you can turn it into a phone by getting a inexpensive app.  I will lay it down to the apple iPad and show what it can do any day.

I was shocked that the Thrive wasn't heavier. I work from home,  so the 10.1\" screen is great (I watch a lot of movies & TV online). If I were someone who was going to carry it around a lot, I would probably get the 7\" instead. The Thrive is smooth, and the wifi connectivity has been great.

I was mostly interested in getting it for learning games and Kindle books for her. I was debating between this versus the Kindle Fire. I'm extremely happy with my decision based on a few features.Pros:-Nice size. A 10.1\" tablet isn't the best if you're traveling a lot or are really interested in having a light, small tablet. But it's perfect for watching movies and playing games.-Screen: The screen isn't equal to say the iPad, but it's pretty close. For rougly half the price it's a really great product. We use it for watching Netflix and it delivers a great picture. Also use it for reading childrens Kindle picture books and it has great quality with that as well.-Android OS: Really enjoy the usability of this tablet. The OS is very smooth and easy to use. My 7 year old has no problems with it.-Removable battery-Speed: I can browse the internet easily with this and feel like it's pretty fast.Cons:-Sound: The sound quality sucks. When we're watching a movie on this the sound has to be turned all the way up, there can't be any other noises around and you have to keep your hands away from the speaker or you just can't hear anything. Headphones make it better, but there's only one jack. This is the worst thing about the tablet in my opinion. If you're thinking of getting this for media functions like movies and music, you might want to go to an electronics store to try it out first.-Battery life: Not nearly as good as the iPad, but again, it's half the price, so I can deal with it. It does have a removable babbery, so it would be feasible to get an extra for long trips and such. When we take it out we leave WiFi off and don't really have a problem with it dying.", "Date": "February 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome tablet", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1KO42LRYWQU9K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Tons of reviews already, so not too much more for me to say.

Storage options are so easy you don't need to go the full 32 gig, but I was a little uncomfortable with just 8 gigs.  I also bought the sleeve case, the screen protector and the stylus.  The sleeve case is fine, unlike some I had no problem applying the screen protector, and the stylus is a must.  Fingers work fine but often hit the wrong spot.Battery life has proven to be very good (eight hours or so) and the included software is decent (some of which you may want to delete).  There is a slight lag when using the onscreen keyboard, but we're talking about a 1 gig operating system and 1 gig of memory.  This isn't your souped up laptop in a smaller package (yet), but does fine if you don't want to haul around the full lap top.  It goes where you need to go and is much more easily transported.The Android system is getting there.  It's not quite ready for prime time, but it works reasonably well and I would have to believe it improves greatly over time.  Available apps at this point in time are limited and some of them get horrible reviews.  Apple and Microshaft had their start up problems too.The quality of the video is very acceptable.  It easily plays high quality video from MSNBC and other similar sites.  The full size USB and HDMI ports are nice, and an acceptable reason for the thickness of the Thrive.  It also feels very good and solid in my rather large hands, offers the option of different colored backs, and here's the biggie, an easily field replaceable battery.  Batteries are around $70 and easily replaced for an almost unlimited amount of time using the device if you keep a couple of extra ones charged.Here's where it absolutely falls on it's face.  No one expects miniature speakers to sound good, and these are fine for what they are, but you do expect to plug in a set of phones or earbuds and get some satisfaction.  Not so with the Thrive.  There is no power at the earbud/headphone jack, meaning you can't get enough volume for satisfactory audio levels.  I have very good hearing, and it's really, really bad.  In a noisy airport environment you won't be able to hear whatever you're watching.  I'm going to get around that with an inline headphone amp, but this is absolutely the worst feature of this otherwise very nice tablet.  How Toshiba screwed this up is beyond me, but it is what it is.Using a thumb drive requires that you reformat it in ex(FAT) before it will work with the thrive, but I did that on my laptop last night, then downloaded an MPEG4 movie to it and it plays fine.  There are several little things like this you have to work around while Android evolves.In all, I like my little Toshiba Thrive.  I wish I didn't have to have an outboard amp for my earbuds, but right now that's about the only thing I would really complain about.  It's very user friendly, easy to customize and it travels well.  I bought it on Amazon for $399.  I bet it's down to $100 by next year, if it's even still in production, but I can use it as is and hopefully enjoy it for a couple of years before the 50 gig, quad pro devices show up for $300.UPDATE:  I received a Boostaroo headphone amp today and the volume problem is solved.  I'm using Sony MDR-NC22 earbuds with an impedance of 20 ohms power on and 8.5 ohms power off, so it isn't a high impedance issue, it's a problem with the Thrive power output at the headphone jack.

I am able to watch movies, download and play games, read (with the kindle app), check email and get on the internet.

You get a full-size USB port, mini-usb port, full-size SD card slot & full-size HDMI port. The HD dock gives you two more USB ports and one HDMI port, so you could plug a mouse, keyboard and hard drive into the Thrive at the same time and theoretically drive content to two monitors. Toshiba has included a file manager, so that when you plug in your external hard drive, you will be able to view all of your files in a very easy to read interface. There is also support for MS Office documents and the usual productivity apps from the Marketplace as well. Not only that, but Toshiba has included a full-functioning media player that supports Windows Media files, either audio or video. This means that you will not need to convert files for playback on the Thrive from your Windows PC. This is the only Android tablet that does this, until the Lenovo Thinkpad hits the market on Tuesday.With the Thrive and upcoming Thinkpad, you can actually be productive on a tablet and these are the only two examples of Android tablets that you can say that about. The only bummer here is that for some reason, the Honeycomb Netflix app does not yet support streaming on the Thrive, but I'm sure it will be coming shortly. I would only recommend this device for office use, as it's value is best served in the workplace.

I almost returned it, but decided she could do so if she really didn't want it.Those fears were unfounded.  As soon as she got it she was overjoyed.

It operated beautifully - for about a dozen times - then would no longer take a charge at all.  I replaced the battery, the cord, the charger block, and also did all the troubleshooting steps.  Nothing worked.  No lights, no power...nothing.  I read where I could send it back to Toshiba to be checked out for repair, but it would have cost me over half the cost of the original tablet price for what they would perceive as a \"minor\" problem and more than the full original price if they deemed it to be a \"major\" problem, not including shipping.  Forget that.  A lot of people who bought this also had the same problem, so I find it hard to believe that Toshiba is unaware that there is a recurring hardware problem.  Customer service does not address this issue at all.  I am now looking for a large tablet, but wquld never consider buying one from Toshiba again.  They have lost me as a customer, apparently with many other people, over this issue.

Mostly.Despite its bulk, there's something about having some heft to it that makes the thing feel more solid. Granted it can make your arms ache after a while of holding but it doesn't feel like it'll snap in half if I hold it too hard either. That 32GB of internal space (the model I got) helps quite a bit, though I'd recommend getting a large SD card to match as well; you're going to fill it up quickly if you play games or download movies on it like I do. Between a laptop and this, it was a close call, but the Thrive won out on the grounds of portability and the fact that the battery can last for half a day at a time if you don't do a lot of web surfing/video watching on it.Only things keeping it from perfect 5/5 are:1) I didn't root right off the bat. Feel stupid for upgrading immediately, as that blocks out a lot of stuff I could do and use otherwise. Still love it to death; just a bit saddened that companies feel the need to block off so much access just because they can - especially since Toshiba doesn't really support the Thrive anymore :< 2) Needs better HDMI-OUT support. Looks blocky and pixelated when I hook it up to the TV.3) Stock browser is absolute bollocks. Minor complaint, really, as there are workarounds that are easy enough to get hold of.and 4) Seems to lag horribly and/or crash with some videos (basically any video site that's NOT YouTube). That might be related to me not getting it rooted, but whatever. I can deal with it.NOTE: Don't be a dunce like me and just upgrade the firmware immediately; take time and figure out how to root (opening access to the \"Super\" account, basically the equivalent of a Windows Admin account) your Thrive. A lot of things require root access, and unless you want to have a lot of heartache that your little Thrive isn't pushing up to speed, get it rooted ASAP!!", "Date": "July 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Two-Year Life Span!", "Author": "Cully Dale", "ReviewID": "R1947APCH0X7QN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "What a nightmare!

It is a smidgen on the heavy side, but again, this is relatively unnoticeable in everyday situations.Pros:- A huge array of input options, including full-sized USB, micro USB, full-sized HDMI, and full-sized SD card slot. The full-size SD slot is SDXC-compatible (right now I have a 64 GB SDXC inserted and it's wonderful!).- Standard power jack. Also, comes with a long power cord, about 10 feet long.- Non-slip back cover, great for those with butterfingers (like me).- User-replaceable battery (however, the battery-life is relatively short).- Microphone works well (I list this as a pro because one of the other tablets I had, the Asus Transformer, had a nearly unusable microphone).- Physical rotation-lock switch.- Haptic: Provides vibration capabilities.- Low power consumption in standby mode (left it on all night and lost only about two percent).Cons:- Power, volume, and screen-rotation lock switch are somewhat difficult to manipulate because they are small and stiff to the touch. The power switch is especially stiff.- The camera is mounted in the middle of the one of the short sides. This means, in video chats you will be slightly off-center. Also, it's easy inadvertently touch the camera lens cover.- Lights indicating power, battery charging, and wifi on the bezel are sometimes distracting, especially when watching movies.- Relatively short battery life due its small battery.", "Date": "December 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "W O W !!!!", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Texas Quilter\"", "ReviewID": "R1TW4Q44TZU7YY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Toshiba tablet is the best, bought his and hers for Christmas, tablet offers such a variety of activities, we are definitely enjoying using this Toshiba tablet.

I felt the same way when I purchased mine, many, many months ago.  I did select the Thrive for the same very reasons as many of the excited reviewers did, namely for the \"control \" and \"accessibility \".  I did like the ports, the rest seemed to be on par.  It was my first tablet, had no point of reference.Three months later I bought my wife the Transformer.  Very soon started noticing the differences.  Yes, it is true that Thrive has the ports, which I used. But everything else, the user experience (when you have a chance to compare to other tablets side by side) lags behind. First, the tablet is slow.  When awaken, it takes up to 30 seconds for the icons to populate the screen.  When trying to shift to the next screen I  experience a visible delay. Applications take their precious time when launched. For the purpose of full disclosure, I periodically clean my memory and reboot the tablet every several days. Second, after the most recent update certain apps do not longer work. Even after removed and reinstalled, I am unable to make them work.  I was offered refunds from the Play store for those apps as the developers knew of the problem.Keep in mind that I also have access to my wife's Transformer. When I can put my hands on it, my preferred choice is the Transformer as it is much, much faster than the Thrive. The same apps that do not work on Thrive, work perfectly on the Transformer.  Maybe the reason why is that the Thrive is still on Honeycomb 3.2 where the Transformer is on the Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0.That brings the issue of manufacturer support.  The technology is changing very fast these days and what was hot six months ago, today is a yesterday's toy. Toshiba seems to be busy producing newer tablets with more advanced version of the operating system, while the Thrive is still on 3.2.  Before you jump the ship and decide to go with the Thrive, check the Thrive users forums to see how many users feel neglected by Toshiba and swear not to buy another Toshiba tablet.  Count me in, I need a product that is fully and actively supported by the manufacturer so it can keep up with the times.I would not recommend this product.", "Date": "July 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good with few problems", "Author": "Viktor", "ReviewID": "R2SLNGSSE9UK5V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've bought it about a month ago, didn't use it everyday but works with it long enough.What I like is: a new (at least to me) Android 3.1 Honeycomb, starts fast and works nice with few exceptions - both mini- and regular USB ports don't give you access to device's memory, they only can connect external devices, and when you're trying to connect external Flash drive it can read only FAT32 - not good for large size movies file. I've found a lot of good software for Honeycomb, free or not expensive, like FBReader for fb2 books, MX video player for a huge selection of video formats, including .mkv, OfficeSuite Pro for reading/editing MS Office files, etc. The screen is good, nice resolution, easy operating multitouch, good viewing angle. Front camera good for Skype (even the current Skype version for Android can be better)What I do not like is:- the weight (I understand that the battery is heavy, but ...),- it's sound - when I'm using Skype, I can't hear it well enough, same with the music on headphones.- I was trying to use Google maps on the road without internet connection, and it didn't find my location on the Highway 80 in Pennsylvania -  I think that GPS should do it.- I've bought for it Toshiba carrying case - the only one I've found for this device - it's terrible: its doubled the thickness of device, making it huge and heavy.- greatest problem with it is that every time I'm switching it ON, I'm not sure, will it read the SD card or not - 50% yes, 50% No. I don't know what's the reason, because I've tried the card on my laptop many times without any problems.Summary: Toshiba should work more on it to improve the quality and solve problems, but even the current version is my today's favorite.", "Date": "December 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Tablet", "Author": "Angela Oas", "ReviewID": "R2YDJMFQWMQ64R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first time owning a tablet, and I did a lot of research before deciding on this one and I can't say that I am beyond satisfied.

At this point it has all of the apps that I care about that are also in my iPhone 5, so that's not an issue. However the biggest selling points are now really irrelevant..I loved the ability to use my thumb drives, however since I have now graduated to DropBox, thumb drives are now irrelevant for me. As for the removable battery, I never bought a spare and have not had the need for one. The battery life is fair, lasting no more than 5 hours, and that is not including watching vids.There are several very annoying things about this machine. The browser crashes frequently. And there is a frequent warning message that the Android process has stopped, whatever that means.The Thrive is \"okay,\" but having owned an iPhone for over a year, I have seen the future and it is Apple, not Android. The only thing that would prevent my next purchase from being an Apple is if Windows 8 tablets offer a full experience with Microsoft Office. The single most important thing for me is having full-functioning Excel at my fingertips..No tablet has that, but one that offers full Excel functionality along with the flexibility of a mouse will get my next purchase. So does that mean I should buy an ultrabook? Maybe. Or will Microsoft make the current tablet software market irrelevant by offering full functionality of windows with all the best features of a tablet?

After not using the thing for a couple of days I finally decided to turn it on only to find out that it would not come out of it's sleep state, (did a bit of research online and found out it's common problem with a lot of Thrive owners), so I had to take the battery out; leave it alone for 5 minutes and put it back in.

It was a great price.  It was also my first tablet experience.When it arrived, I pulled it out of the box, pulled off the plastic from the screen, and put one  GreatShield Ultra Anti-Glare (Matte) Clear Screen Protector Film for Toshiba Thrive 10.1 Touchscreen Tablet (3 Pack) on it.  Thankfully, they came in a three pack, as, I hadn't realized when I was lining it up that it wasn't sticky on my fingers, but it would rapidly meld to the screen.  Strangely, it was centered, but there were bubbles everywhere.  I let that part go so I could turn it on and play.Turned it on and immediately knocked out the software update.  Kaching!  Ready to go!I began collecting apps like potato chips.  Some worked.  Some didn't.  I actually never got the FB app to work properly.  Also, the Android Marketplace lagged quite a bit.  Often, when I thought I'd downloaded an app, it actually never got to the install step.The screen was beautiful.  I admit, I never thought the concept of watching a movie on it was appealing, so I never did.  I don't subscribe to Netflix, and streaming movies eats my bandwidth like nobody's business (Verizon MIFI).The sound wasn't that great.  In fact, the location of the volume control is not in a great place, either.  I found myself turning the sound up instead of powering down the system on several occasions.  But, the sound popped and crackled at points---not enough to be terribly annoying, but enough to notice.  I did not use headphones at any time.I was happily fighting over the Thrive with my husband for a few weeks, resisting the urge to shout, \"Mine!\" when he wouldn't give it back.  He was busy smashing ants and firing birds from a slingshot.  I thought he would break the screen with his hard, end of the finger tap instead of the gentle, pad of the finger touch.  I kept trying to tell him, \"It's a TOUCH screen, honey.\"  Thankfully, it's not a fragile screen, or Mr. Power Poker would have shattered the screen from corner to corner.Within about a week, I decided to replace the screen protector.  I should have left it alone, as, I ended up with more bubbles and dust (what?!) between the protector and the screen.I took a few goofy pictures of myself to use as my FB profile.  The camera on the front ain't too hot.  I decided to use the camera on the back.  I'm not photogenic (or I see myself differently than others do, I guess), but they weren't that hot, either.  The light in my house wasn't wonderful that evening, so I had to blast lights on in order to get a half decent shot.  I wouldn't put a great rating on either front or back camera.I tried Oovee (oovoo?  whatever) with it.  It was okay, but I found the images choppy and strange.  I'll pass on any kind of video calling, I think.I was also able to load the Kindle app.  Unfortunately, I was too distracted by marbles, and word games, and angry birds to read much.  The Thrive is a wonderful time waster, as I assume any tablet is.I got two separate apps to move some of my apps to the SD card.  It seemed neither one of them would work.  A quick lookup on the internet... you can't get there from here.  Nope.  Can't run apps from SD card.  So much for my theory that I was going to 'upgrade' my Thrive with a simple SD card.The battery life wasn't awesome, either.  I changed the brightness settings on the screen and made sure my wifi and GPS were off when not in use, but I still never got more than four hours of use.I hadn't gotten a chance to use the GPS for the first three weeks.  I can't help it if I know where I'm going!  The third week, my darling mother-in-law provided me with a perfect opportunity for mapping and GPS.  She had a doctor's appointment at a doctor's office in new place!  The night before, I carefully used the Google Map app and planned out our route.  It was perfect, with driving directions and everything!  I loaded the map app in the morning, route planned, and headed out the door.  By the time I arrived to pick up my MIL, the app shut down.  I sat out in the car, turning the map back on and turning on GPS.  I finally got the GPS satellites to agree where I was, and the map wouldn't load.  All I had was squares with a little blue icon for my location.  Not much help.So, just before I turned the GPS and the Thrive off in frustration, the right half of the screen went black.  What?!  I turned the Thrive all the way off.When I arrived back home later that morning, I turned the Thrive back on.  It seemed okay.  In fact, it even loaded the stupid map.  I began playing a game of Jewels and forgot all about my earlier troubles with the Thrive.  I almost ignored the phone when it rang, I was having such a good time.  I answered and let my Thrive wait for me.The Thrive went to sleep while I was gone, and when I came back, I could not move the little lock out of the circle no matter how much I tried.  I almost started poking the screen like my husband does smashing ants, but decided to reboot instead.I thought the sleepy screen problem was solved with a Toshiba software update.  Apparently not, because, sleep mode caused another stuck lock.I surfed the internet for solutions to the problem.  I thought I had it solved, but, all the sudden, while in Browser, my screen freaked out.  I had red, blue, and black lines running across the whole screen.Another week of weird glitches like that, and I decided the Thrive was not for me.  I decided to box it up and send it back.  It hadn't been a whole month, and it was already having problems.  I suspect the problems I had were the graphics function, but I don't know.  I couldn't get a replacement from HSN, and I didn't really know if I wanted one.Other things I noticed during my Thrive ownership:  my husband clicked the SD card out, thinking it was the power button.  It's not a covered area.  Just a push/lock.  I loved the Amazon App of the Day.  If you have Android, do not miss this.  The keyboard was a little hard to get used to.  I found myself two finger typing... until I found the preloaded Swype keyboard.  Now that was pretty neat.  I hated the fact that it came with several apps that weren't removable (Kapersky and the office demo).Also, I did a side by side comparison to the Ipad2 with the Thrive.  The Thrive is a little wider, but not much.  It's also not that much heavier.  It's much lighter on the wallet, though. The Ipad2 was a little faster, but we never compared for boot times (my Thrive took longer than my desktop to boot).How does it compare to other Android tabs?  I can't answer that.  I carefully chose the Thrive because of it's extra options that I didn't find in other tablets:  HDMI port, full-size USB, and SD card options.  Turns out I never used anything but the SD card, and that wasn't usable for the apps option.Maybe I got a lemon.  I don't know.  I just didn't feel like hassling with Toshiba over it.BTW, I still have a screen protector left.  I think I'll use it as a dust collector.", "Date": "December 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "My first tablet...okay but wish it could do more", "Author": "ACDC", "ReviewID": "R5F8QB4OOAZ17", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got this as a Christmas present from my wife. I do like all the features (USB, SDcard, bluetooth, etc.) but I still wish this could do more. This is mostly at fault to Google and Android, though, as it is software limitations that are causing me headaches. A few things I'd like to do which seem very difficult to me (and I'm pretty computer savvy):1. Play all of my video files...MPEG, AVI, MOV, etc...I've found some apps that'll do some but not others. Found one app that seemed to work but then wouldn't play the entire video on some! Also, digital movies are pretty much useless on here. I've tried converting them using multiple programs with no luck (always choppy or something corrupt).2. Open office documents easily and be able to create and save Excel, Word, Powerpoint....again, some apps for this but some you have to pay for. Google Drive seems useless to me.3. Would like to access my NAS (server) and music, pictures, etc. that are shared on it...easily! I can use the LG NAS apps to access the data, and that works but I have to download it to the tablet in order to open it. I'd like to be able to stream it directly through the network, like I can do with my laptops...maybe I just haven't found the trick or the app but this seems like rocket science to me and is frustrating.4. Manage my finances using my tablet....right now I have to boot up my laptop when it comes time to pay bills because I currently use Microsoft Money to manage my finances. I know Money is obsolete now and don't expect an app for that, but I looked into switching to Quicken and I don't see any apps for Quicken either...so for now I'm stuck using my laptop every time I have to enter in receipts, etc...which is quite often for me!5. Wish it was powerful enough to run my car's tuning software, but I know it would never be compatible anyway. So, I still have to use my 6 year old laptop for this as well which hooks to my ECU/chip via USB (Moates Quarterhorse using Binary Editor and EEC Analyzer)6. Needs Chrome browser. I would like to be able to integrate my Chrome hyperlinks, etc. with my Tablet. Current Honeycomb browser is terrible and has errors all the time (force closes). I currently use Opera which is more stable but still don't like their bookmark setup.7. Still no sign of ICS (Android 4.0). My new phone has it and it seems nice, though not sure how much better it will make this tablet but I'd still like to have the latest and greatest.For me, this is really only good for browsing the web or it is handy looking stuff up when out working on a car. I put Invisishield on it and got a flip case for it to protect the screen and body and those do a great job.I am in the market for a new laptop, and may wait out for a good Windows 8 tablet that can run my tuning software (with Core i5 or something simlar to the Microsoft Surface) and then I really won't have a use for this anymore. Too bad as I love the potential for Android and love it on my phone for sure, but not sure if they can really keep up with Apple on apps and features for tablets...and with a Windows-based tablet or even ultrabook you can do so much more than either, though you'll likely be paying a premium for that. For me, I still need a laptop for the things mentioned above, so I'd love to integrate both into one unit which soon I may be able to...just not sure if Android will be the base or Windows will be the way to go (more likely).", "Date": "July 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Compare with IPAD?", "Author": "ecmrecordlover \"ecmreh\"", "ReviewID": "R34SPB3EDH1TM2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this model based on reviews.

This is seen still with the Chromebooks. They release items then maybe you will eventually get the functionality advertised. (I tested a Chromebook and can vouch that some features still don't work.)There was a some lag while entering text while programs / apps were installing. Some apps did not install if I was installing more than one. It seemed to hang with \"waiting to install...\" message. Turning off the device worked to fix this; the apps installed upon reboot.Why isn't there an easy way to scroll long web pages? It instead requires repetitive motion gestures over and over and over to scroll down a long webpage. There must be an easier way that can be implemented, like the way it is possible to easily scroll to certain contacts in the phone book. Don't force users to scroll endlessly through pages.As far as other things, which are less related to the software or hardware...There is still no option to have extensions installed for Chrome. So, no ad-blocking software. That means lots of annoying and distracting ads in your face while you browse. Surely they can enable extensions on tablets. I consider it a deal breaker if I must view ads on a device I paid for. There are other options to eliminate ads, but they require additional options and won't always be available depending on how you connect.In general, a tablet offers convenience, but the software limitations tell me to hold off until they hear our complaints and clean up issues outstanding. Apple is an alternative but doesn't allow for ad blocking yet either, at the device level. And, Apple products have suffocating restrictions on what file types they will play.This device definitely offers an advantage with its multitude of possible connections, but basic features such as voice search should definitely be working.

Android Lovers Rejoice, soon our saviour will come, and Apple will tremble at its greatness.", "Date": "April 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good, but not great", "Author": "SCJaredJ", "ReviewID": "ROQMQEZBLAD5R", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "As an avid Android fan I've been longing for an Android tablet to play with since Honeycomb first came out. In the interest of full disclosure, I didn't actually \"buy\" this tablet as I won it as a prize in a contest. I currently have the 16GB model of the Thrive.First off, this thing is huge. It's massive. If you haven't touched it before, quick run down to a store and play with it...it's probably a lot larger than you think. I hadn't actually used one before I got mine and I was a bit taken aback by its size.  You're not going to win any beauty contests with this sucker, and it only gets worse when you add a case to it.  That being said, it didn't take long for me to get over its girth.  The battery plate's rubberized texture makes it pretty easy to hold.  And Toshiba's main claim for the girth is the addition of the SD card slot and full sized usb and hdmi ports.  Honestly, the trade in size is well worth not having to carry around separate adapters for hooking up memory cards, usb drives and hdmi cables.  The only place Toshiba misses the mark with regard to ports is the inclusion of a mini usb port instead of a micro usb port.  Not sure why they did this, but I'd much rather have the micro so I could connect more newer devices to it.As of this review, the Thrive has been updated to Android 3.2, but the one you receive may still have the original 3.1 software on it.  I'd suggest going to settings, about, software updates to download any existing updates before you get too involved in playing with this.  Also note that you'll want to do some research if you're big into rooting and custom roms, as there are reports about the latest factory update breaking some of the rooting techniques.Toshiba provides a mostly stock 3.2 experience with some added benefits. The best enhancement is their inclusion of a file manager that allows you to easily browse through the contents of your Thrive, SD card or USB memory stick.  This is so easy, in fact, that if you're price sensitive you could easily consider going with the 8GB or 16 GB versions instead of the 16/32 GBs and buy a SD card to make up the difference in space.  The SD card port and ease of the file manager makes it a breeze for managing media (essentially videos for kids in my case) on the device.The Thrive's cameras are what you'd expect on a tablet: adequate but not amazing. They're not going to replace your point and shoot, and it's a little awkward taking photos holding the tablet, but it's great for capturing a quick pic or using video chat.The HDMI port mirrors your tablet on your TV or other screen.  It's pretty much plug and play, but I've noticed that the picture quality can vary a bit.  However, this feature, combined with the SD card slot, turns the device into the ultimate picture slideshow as you can quickly display pictures on the TV by swapping out the SD card and using the HDMI out on the TV.  Note that if you do this, don't try to browse through the pictures via the file manager.  The Thrive will show all pictures on the SD card as a folder in the gallery, and this is the best place to flip through pictures. In the file manager, you'll have to click on each picture individually instead of viewing a slideshow.The battery on the Thrive is \"so so\" in my opinion.  It's not as great as other tablets out there, but it will still make it a good ways on a charge. The battery is actually replaceable, so you could buy a spare if you really needed one.  Also, the Thrive charges via a proprietary cable that looks a lot like a laptop cable, so you won't be charging this sucker off your computer if you forget your charger.The last thing I'd like to touch on is the Thrive's Android 3.2 software.  As of this review Toshiba has not released any date for an Android 4 (Ice Cream Sandwich) update.  I found the Thrive to lag a bit, especially when using the browser.  It's not the smoothest device out there, but there are definitely worse tablets on the market. An upgrade to Android 4 should improve this device's user experience.  The main drag with this device's software, however, pertains to its start-up/boot time. Be prepared to wait about a minute for it to turn on and be ready for use. That might not seem long, but when you're staring at that screen it feels like an eternity.Overall, I give the thrive a 3/5 rating.  It has its issues with software and size, but also some great advantages with the many useful ports. Its combination of size, boot time and battery life make the Thrive a tough sell as a commuting device as it provides few advantages over a net book or laptop.  But, if you're looking for a couch tablet that has great flexibility in storage/ports/video connectivity, and you're only planning on travelling with it occasionally, it could be the perfect fit for you.", "Date": "January 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "I feel lied to....", "Author": "Barb Lodge", "ReviewID": "R3PKIKUAX8PX6E", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Screen is scratched, cracked.

And no, it is not heavy and thick because of the battery, since battery life is about half of what you get on ipad.Screen is mediocre. It has good viewing angles, brightness and contrast, but it is not in any way stands out.

(EDIT: After sleeping on it, I've decided to give it 2 stars instead of 1. I was annoyed yesterday and my expectations were probably set too high). I'm not a picky person (it usually does not take much to make me happy). I'm a 44 year old computer engineer that does various web work for a living. My wife got an iPad 2 a few months ago (I don't like Apple as a company, so the iPad is not a consideration) and my best friend, as well as my brother just got Android tablets, so I thought I'd \"get with the times\" and get one too. I've had this device for a week now.I've been disappointed with almost every aspect of this device and just boxed it up to return to Amazon. I bought the THRiVE because my brother bought one and recommended it (and he researches these things to death). I liked the idea of expandability with all the ports.USING A USB DRIVE: I have around 25,000 songs (85GB) in MP3 format on a USB drive and had hoped I would be able to hook it up and listen to them. First, I found out that the drive has to be in exFAT format. That wasn't that big of a deal. It took about 6 hours to backup, reformat in exFAT, and copy my data back onto the drive. That was a one time thing, so it was annoying but not a deal killer. I then plugged in the drive to the THRiVE and went to the file manager and I got a screen that said \"Please wait\". I estimate that if I had of actually waited, it would have taken about an hour for it to do whatever it was doing and display my files (25000 MP3s plus a few thousand other files). So, I went straight to the music player and it actually showed all my music. I picked a song and started playing it. Half way through the song it stopped playing and I got a force close. After that I was getting force closes on everything I tried to do, so had to turn off the unit.BROWSING: I did not like the browser it came with at all (it had major lag when typing). I got the Dolphin browser which I use on my Droid X and it was a lot better, but still had quite a bit of lag when trying to play a game on FaceBook.MISC: The THRiVE came with an app called LogMeIN. That app didn't work at all. It connected to my desktop and showed me an image of the screen, but I could not make any selections or control the mouse. I had the whole tablet lock up one other time and required a power cycle to correct and have received various force closes here an there in other apps.I'm teaching myself Japanese and I did find a couple of good Japanese language apps that worked well, but I can use these on my Droid X or even on my Asus Netbook just as well.To sum up, maybe I had too high of expectations about what a tablet is suppose to be able to do. This tablet (and so far no other tablets) have been able to do what I need them to do well.", "Date": "July 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Squandered potential", "Author": "AT1988", "ReviewID": "R3Q8CPHF6VHBP2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was looking forward to buying this tablet: I love Android and I didn't want to spend the money on the IPad, which I thought would be similar to the IPhone in just being a name. Well I bought the Thrive 16GB, and all I could think was \"what this could have been.\"First off, the app store is seriously lacking. The only good apps which were truly optimized for tab were Bloomberg and CNBC. All the games were the same, but some, like Aliens and Extreme Droid Jump, didn't even work.Also, the ergonomics are terrible, especially considering how you have to hold the thing on your lap a lot. With such a big bezel, maybe it would have been nice if the back buttons, the menu buttons, were on the sides of the thing. Given that all tablets likely break if dropped, its not like the back will really help you if you do drop it. In short, its very inconvenient to use ergonomically.I do like the idea of having a USB drive and HDMI. Problem is that I easily have the latter on my Atrix, and the former isn't too useful without printer drivers, seeing as with wi-fi printing, I could just as easily use an IPad 2. This tab didn't meet the hype, and its only to Toshiba and Google's detriment: such features, if truly usable, meaning a REAL app store, not the terrid Toshiba one, would put forth a genuine competitor to Apple.

Not being an expert with Android platform made me relied on and I decide to try different options based on other advanced users for tablets.2. no brochure or a decent printed manual manual, just a quick guide containing less than basic information. A user's guide is available once you configure your  unit. That is a joke since you must have a hard copy to set it up. It may be an intuitive device to set up for those who are familiar with electronic devices,  tablets, and PCs. Not recommended for newbies.3. Thrive may be impressive in features but either the device itself, the apps, or software updates, in my modest opinion, can not offer much solution to  troubleshoot, configure or resolve compatibility issues.4. I also noted that many unnecessary apps can not be uninstalled o even removed from the screens. That is annoying. I use technology for work not entertainment.  I use this kind of electronic devices to improve and produce better results in those areas where I require a little push and speed - productivity, efficiency,  etc. All the bells and whistles built in make no sense at all if they are there for decoration or fun purposes.5.

I was both happy and disappointed to find out that  I was not the only frustrated creature experiencing either the same or related issues before, during, or after setup and regular use.7. i did not want to give up and I called Toshiba Tech Support for assistance.

I am sorry to write this -- because I was excited to receive the Thrive off pre-order -- but the tablet was not what I thought it would be.  I bought the Thrive primarily for business use.  I was encouraged by the presence of the various ports, which would allow transfer of information between the device and my work PC, and also by the ability to edit share Word-based documents.  I also liked the replacable battery feature and the idea of carrying videos to watch when traveling for work.In reality, once I got the Thrive, I regularly received error message that various applications were being forced to close.  I don't know whether this is a symptom of Honeycomb or of the device.  When I tried to edit and distribute Word documents using the Quickoffice application, my colleagues could not open and review the documents -- which showed up corrupted.  The device did not work with Netflix or other video rental sites -- including the video aspect of the Android market.  In fact, I could not find any legal site to rent movies from that worked on the Thrive.  Worst of all, the product feels very cheap compared to my wife's Ipad.  Removing the back to replace the battery is nerve-wracking and it feels like the flimsy back cover is going to crack.  This is a disincentive to making use of the replaceable battery.  Then, when my Thrive dropped 18 inches from a bench to the floor (while in a padded case), the glass shattered.  I called Toshiba to make a warranty claim and they refused to stand behind the product.  Now I am making an insurance claim through my credit card -- but I will not be replacing the Thrive with another Thrive.  For use in the real world, I need a product that has the bugs worked out and that is reliable and strongly built.  It is too bad, but my experience is that the Trhive is not that product.

I can design and build computers, and develop software for them, that being said I think I know about computers and tablets.It's been 2 weeks and I believe its time for me to review this tablet.-Before I purchased my toshiba thrive, I've read so many positive reviews about it, and after owning a couple other tablets (which I will talk about) I figured Toshiba must have nailed it.I was wrong.-What makes Toshiba Thrive \"different\" than the other tablets?It has a full size USB and an HDMI outlet, do you really need these outlets? depends, most of us own both computers and a some sort of media center at hour homes, so don't let HDMI outlet fool you, having full size USB is okay but it is not like you will be using it everyday. It also has an user replaceable battery, you see this is 21st century we don't use these gadgets for more than 2 years anymore, back then in 90s we could use the same phone or PC for 3+ years, no more.  So why would you wanna replace the battery on a tablet? Toshiba is selling their battery for thrive for 69.99, sounds like its a good deal? well it is not. Apple will replace your iPad's battery for 105, and iPad's battery is about 2.5x times bigger than the thrive's battery (capacity wise). So the next question would be; does it worth having a tablet 2 times(almost) thicker than an iPad 2 just because you can replace the battery by your self? I would say No.Before talking about the battery life and performance I'd like to talk about Thrive's built quality, because that is one of the reasons I returned my thrive yesterday.-Built QualityI don't know what other reviewers were thinking when they wrote their reviews but Thrive has a cheap feel, it's not well built. I'll tell you why, first of all since I'm in the design field, I can tell that Toshiba didn't spend enough time to design this tablet, they rushed this to the market and  hoped to get a place in android tablet market, anyway like some other reviewers stated, the glass is not well glued, the bezel around the screen is lower or higher than the screen, like it's not at the same level with the glass, unless you push down the glass with your fingers. The \"chrome\" bezel around the cameras kills the tablet, like it's so cheaply made you see that sort of chrome plastic on cheaply made auto accessories, they could at least use some sort of brushed metal, chrome is not that popular anymore. The back cover is a joke. I have no clue what toshiba was thinking when they came up with that back cover, it has rough edges and the quality of the plastic is terrible, and instead of HUGE Toshiba logo, they could've put a nice THRIVE (very idiotic name for a tablet, and LG had a cell phone called thrive so I don't know why they picked that name, like T1 would be a better name for their first tablet with android os) logo on the back with a small Toshiba logo under it or somewhere. I even had a chance to buy other colors, got the silver cover on amazon and the blue one from best buy, they both look very cheap, and not worth 20 bucks. I'll put it this way, a 99 dollar refurbished amazon kindle looks and feels better than a 399 thrive, that little e-reader is very well built, and it doesn't look like you made it at home. (thrive lovers don't hate me, if you don't believe me, go hold a kindle or a Samsung Galaxy 10.1)Now you may be thinking that I'm just exaggerating what I wrote up there, well I'm not, I compared thrive with iPad, iPad 2, Galaxy 10.1, Xoom, Playbook. Asus Transformer, and Acer Iconia. I was fortunate enough to own and use all of those tablets I listed there, and still have the iPad 2.-ScreenToshiba claims their screen on thrive is superior, hmm I guess they haven't seen the screen on Samsung Galaxy 10.1 or the BB Playbook. There is simply nothing special with Thrive's screen and I don't like the vertical view on it. Galaxy 10.1 sure has a better screen.-PerformanceJust like many other honeycomb tablets toshiba has the nvidia tegra 2 cpu and 1 Gb ram,  thrive works just like a Galaxy 10.1 or a Xoom, never had any frozen screens or anything, so no issues with the performance.-Battery lifeVery impressive, I was able to surf/chat/watch stuff for about 11 hours, good thing about thrive's battery is, it can  be fully charged in about an hour, which really makes it special.-Hold and feelIt really is nice to hold it, you don't really get tired even though its somewhat heavier than the other tablets I have listed up there, the rubberized back feels good in your hands (wish it wasn't cheaply built), but unfortunately it feels cheap, its not the tablet you'd be proud to use during a business meeting.-Honeycomb on thrive (Operating system)Honeycomb is okay, since it works flash and great apps, it is the best OS on tablets (for now). User interface is a joke though, can't say I like the menus or the clock when you wake up your tablet. One thing that bothered me was Thrive came with so many junk apps and I wasn't able to remove them. Anyway unfortunately this is not a pure android tablet (like motorola xoom) meaning it gets its system updates from toshiba through toshiba service center app (very unnecessary), so while xoom is running the latest version of honeycomb, thrive users are stuck with 3.1 still.Like many other reviewers said it used to have the this problem causing users to reset their tablets after their tablets go to sleep because they refused to wake up from sleep, its fixed with the update toshiba released so its not a problem now, Honeycomb on thrive is still a bit buggy, but will please the regular users for now. Oh almost forgot, still no Netflix or Hulu support, that is a deal breaker at this point, after all who wouldn't like to watch Mad Men on their tablets before going to sleep?-AccessoriesThrive has like no accessories, toshiba has this case for thrive, which makes your thrive look like its a Britannica encyclopedia (not lying with the case it is almost as thick as a Britannica). So unlike iPad 2 or Galaxy you won't be seeing so many accessories for thrive, the dock (50 something dollars) works okay but not necessary and does not come with the charger so its somewhat rip off. Bluetooth stuff works great with thrive, I was able to use apple's bluetooth keyboard with it with no problems.-ConclusionIf you are planning to buy an android tablet and spend your hard earned dollars on something you'd like to enjoy while using it and be proud of it, thrive is not the tablet for you, if you are working at a construction site or a general contractor, toshiba thrive can satisfy your needs (not because its durable or anything, the rubberized back and thick design make the thrive suitable for construction site, where looks don't matter) but if you are using it at home or office then you might wanna go with another tablet, I know I will sound like a fanboy but for now the best android tablet is Samsung Galaxy 10.1, its very well built and looks nice. You also might wanna check the Motorola Xoom out, for 449 its a bargain, it has 32gb built in memory, and it's almost as good as the Samsung Galaxy 10.1.Also I'm not even talking about Acer Iconia or Asus EEE transformer as they are not worth talking about, they are both cheaply built, and I don't really support companies that mark up their prices then lower them according to their sales, like you could get an Acer Iconia for 399 from target about two weeks ago, and get a 100 dollars gift card with your purchase to spend on groceries or whatever you want. Same with Asus, transformer's price changes almost everyday its like stocks. This is somewhat frustrating because I'm sure nobody wants to see their gadgets for less than what they paid for them, that is what I like about Apple, iPad has been 499 (cheapest model) forever now.Anyway  I am rating thrive 3 stars but if they lower its price to 299 for the 8gig model and 349 for the 16 gig then it would deserve 3.5 stars.Last but not least, Sony will be releasing their tablet on September 16, it seems like its gonna be one of the best Android tablets, but I really don't think it will be better than the Galaxy 10.1 or Xoom, it won't have gorilla glass (they said they would make the tablet heavier), so the screen will get scratched if you don't have a screen protector, which I'm sure you wouldn't wanna ruin the design of a beautiful tablet with a screen protector, also it comes with Honeycomb 3.1 so they are already behind Galaxy 10.1 and Xoom, but its still worth checking out.Thanks for reading, and rating, you can leave your questions and comments, I'll make sure to reply.And I apologize for any grammar, or spelling mistakes I have.

To my knowledge Toshiba is the only tablet maker that doesn't have a deal with Netflix at this point, and they don't seem to have any urgency to strike a deal. Netflix is an app that can sell tablets, or break them. Toshiba knows this. Maybe they just don't care, as they have announced they are planning to release a brand new slimmer tablet to compete with the Galaxy tab 10.1. Don't buy this tablet, Toshiba makes great products but don't support the products they make. I bought this Thrive the first day it hit the market, and own Toshiba televisions and laptops. I'm unlikely to buy anything else from them because of the way they've handled this whole thing. More people need to know that this device doesn't play Netflix when all of it's competitors do. Maybe Toshiba will finally do something about this when enough people complain. I should not have to risk rendering my device useless just to be able to get what has become the most basic, standard functionality in Netflix.Edit: Now that the Thrive plays Netflix I couldn't be more happy with it. Definitely the best tablet out there that i've used.

I have an apple iPad and read the reviews online regarding the Thrive.  I liked what I read as well as the price so I bought it.  When my mother opened it at Christmas she was absolutely thrilled...until she started attempting to use it.  I thought she couldn't use it because she was my 67 year old mother so as I was trying to help her, I noticed the problem did not lie with her.  The apps are impossible to find.  Switching from one screen to another is easy because it did it automatically right when we were in the middle of something and didn't want to switch.  Also, it turned off all by itself whenever it wanted and right in the middle of things.  When I searched for the Facebook app, it told me it wasn't available in the app store.  The app store only had about 20 apps that were easily findable.  The Apple iPad puts this little tablet to complete shame.  I ended up returning the Toshiba and gave my mom an iPad which she absolutely adores.  It is a million and a half times more user friendly than this Toshiba.  My friend also bought her mom the Thrive and she, too, returned it for the exact same reasons.  My friend's mother actually had to have a girl with a degree in software engineering help her find apps for the thing.

So I contacted the seller and told them if I could exchange it for another unit, since I really like the tablet.  But without the box, they emailed me that I would have to call the manufacturer to see if Toshiba could help.  In other words, they just pass on all the responsibility to the manufacturer.  This is no help at all!  Shouldn't the seller be the one to take back the product and return it to Toshiba?So I did call Toshiba directly.  But the tech support operator kept putting me on hold, and told me that they could only repair the unit.  But first I would have to register it before he would give me the address of Toshiba where I would have to ship back the unit.  I would then get it back 7-10 days after.  But the problem is, I bought the tablet because I intended to bring it with me to the Philippines, where I will be staying for 4-5 months.
