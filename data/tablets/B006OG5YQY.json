This iPad was exactly what I was looking for.  Very classy in the black color, it works great, and I use it for EVERYTHING!  I can check email (work and private) on it; I love using it for Netflix and I have the Nook app on it!  Excellent product and alternative to the higher priced iPad 3!  Would definitely recommend.", "Date": "August 27, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B006OG5YQY"}}
