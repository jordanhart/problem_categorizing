{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Makes the iPad feel dated and obsolete", "Author": "ErickinOKC", "ReviewID": "R3ECPO32L5VWE2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I worked for Apple for several years and was part of the initial iPad launch. I was skeptical when the tablet market took off, thinking I'd never have a legitimate use for something like this, but when I held the first iPad on launch day, it felt like a special device. I bought one and was a loyal iOS/Apple user until this past year. I felt my iPad particularly had lost its luster and its legitimacy as a helpful device -- it never evolved past being a toy, something to read a magazine on or casually play games. Especially as phones got bigger, the iPad felt less unique.I tried a Galaxy Note 8.0 and my interest in tablets was reinvigorated. The usefulness of the S-Pen, the inventiveness of Samsung's TouchWiz UI (while I do think it's a bit overkill and find myself turning much of it off, and while I do replace the launcher with Nova from the Play Store) with features like Multi-Window and Air Command, and the deeper productivity capabilities of Android (changing default apps, downloading/attaching/sharing files easily among apps) made me see that it wasn't the size of the iPad that had become obsolete, it was the limitations of the device and its ecosystem.I switched to the Galaxy Note 10.1 - 2014 Edition when it launched and am incredibly happy that I did. The screen is gorgeous, Samsung's tweaks and use of Android 4.3 are much improved over the previous iteration, the S-Pen has gotten even better, and the TouchWiz UI has gotten less intrusive. This is a fantastic tablet that I use to take notes in all my meetings, read on the treadmill, watch shows on a plane, and listen to music from while getting ready each morning. It's a truly beautiful, premium device, one that makes the iPad -- even the new iPad Air -- feel dated and limited. I can't recommend the Galaxy Note 10.1 - 2013 Edition enough.", "Date": "November 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome!", "Author": "T.J.", "ReviewID": "R3C4W370JZ9GRZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the best out of the box electronic product I've ever bought.

My husband and daughter both have iPads.  I previously had an Asus Transformer Prime tablet and now this Galaxy Note.  I love the Galaxy Note.  I had originally purchased a Kindle Fire a few days before (only because it was cheaper).  I ended up sending the Kindle Fire back after only having it for less than 2 hours.  I didn't like the user interface on the Kindle and there was no Vudu app available.  I could have lived with the user interface that I didn't like, but the no Vudu was a deal breaker for me.My daughter that has the iPad, sometimes uses my Galaxy Note.  There is no denying that iPads are good.  She is not disappointed with the iPad in anyway, but even she says that if her iPad ever stops working she wants a tablet like mine to replace it.The picture on this tablet will AMAZE you!  I can assure you that the picture quality is top notch.  The sound quality on this is good.  While I wish the sound was louder, I really can't complain because the sound on this Galaxy Note it better than my daughter's iPad and FAR exceeds my previous Asus tablet.  The interface is typical Android look and feel.The pen that comes with the tablet has some good features, but I don't use it often.  If you buy this tablet definitely read up on the whole S-pen functionality.  It is good for note taking if you know how to use the great features that come with it.  Overall, I would recommend this tablet.", "Date": "May 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "A college student's review of the the galaxy note 10.1 2014", "Author": "Ivan Go", "ReviewID": "R3KUAXQJMHLNO1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I use this tablet mainly for note taking in college. So i use S note a lot.  This is the main reason why I bought this tablet. So far it has served my needs pretty well.  Below is my honest opinion about this tablet.  This tablet is an upgrade from my 1st generation IPAD. Haha!The good:1) The screen resolution really blows your mind away.  It is the clearest and sharpest screen I have ever seen yet.  I have no problems staring at the for hours and still admiring its beauty.2)  When running without any problems, this tablet is a beast. It is a powerhouse.  It can handle any applications you throw at it with ease.  it can play any HD games with no problem at all so far.  Surfing the web is a joy and the multi window feature really helps especially when I'm taking down notes.3) Using the S pen is a joy and i believe it is the best thing to a pen and paper experience out there.  It writes smoothly and accurately as opposed to the display units in Best buy that i have tried.  I tried writing on my friend's IPAd and there was no comparison.  This tablet is miles ahead of the competition in terms of the handwriting recognition and note taking capabilities.The Bad:1) One of the things that stops me from giving this tablet a 5 Star rating is because of the occasional crashes and glitches I experienced. SO far, i experienced glitches from the games and also S note in the midst of taking down notes in class which can get pretty annoying.  I might be quite harsh in my comments but given that this product is one of the most expensive tablets out there and a direct competitor to the IPAd, I believe this tablet should be more than good.  If not close to perfection.2)  The home button at the center of the tablet really gets in the way during note taking. When writing on the 2nd half of the screen, I have to be cautious and careful not to touch the home button. This really made the whole tablet experience a tedious one.3)  The screen scratches very easily for some reason.  I tried using my friend's stylus pen on my tablet and my screen got scratched.  I didn't want to get a screen protector because I'm afraid it will affect the superb handwriting recognition of the tablet.4) The stylus that came with this tablet is pretty small and thin. My hand get tired writing with it after a 1 hour lecture.Overall, I like this tablet.  It has grown into my schedule ever since I bought it and I can't leave for class without having my tablet with me! I would definitely recommend this tablet to anyone looking for a good note taking device and can also double up as a good multimedia device.  You just need to live with the occasional glitches as for now and hope for an update that will fix these problems in the future.", "Date": "January 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Expensive tablet but worth the money (updates fixed performance issues)", "Author": "Tundey Akinsanya", "ReviewID": "R3GCDSIB152JJT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are reading these reviews, am going to assume you've read the industry reviews and are looking for first hand account from people who actually paid for the tablet, right? Well do yourself a favor: buy it already. The major issues have been addressed: performance & lack of multi-profile. Samsung's TouchWiz is still there so if you hate that, don't even bother.

If you think I've missed one please ask and Ill rate it.Ill use a 0-5, 5 being the best.This is a review done PRE-rooting, but post \"tuning\" and software updates. Ill update when I get around to rooting and really tuning the crap out of it.Screen - 4.3You guys all know the specs. It lives up well, and only falls short a bit. The color range is decent, without being overly saturated. Its just not as deep black and bright white as the previous Note PLS screen. The high res and overall good color reproduction make up for it though. The high res makes text much clearer, and now multi window for documents is better. As a piece of advice, \"reading mode\" was turned on my default on my unit, this seems to change bright white to a soft off white. It does help with eye strain, but makes it look muted elsewhere.Sound - 4.4Good volume and stereo is where its at. The speakers are crisp, clear, and loud enough. Their fault is 2-fold. They lack any real low end, so leave music to headphones. Also, on peak volume certain higher frequency ranges rattle a bit. The speakers being on the side vs front really doesn't seem to make a difference.Construction - 4.2Lets face facts, its plastic. We can compare it all day to an iPad, and obviously it wont come close. As far as Android tablets go, its got one of the most solid feels. I don't get any creaking. The seems where the chrome plastic is could be better, the tolerances seem perfect on the bottom and sides, but the top and a super small difference. THe weight is good, and balance is even. All the buttons response with a soft feel and definite \"click\".Performance - 4.8After getting rid of Touchwiz (for shame Samsung) and putting Nova Launcher Prime on it, it ran great. Even the \"My magazine\" app, which many pre-release reviews showed to be very laggy, lost most of its lag with Nova. High def games run great, and this is the first Android tablet to run Visible Body 3D Human Anatomy Atlas (and very high res, detailed anatomy app) with no hesitation. 1080P movies look fantastic.Battery Life - 4So far I get a day. Thats a day of games, reading, web browsing, ect. So not a day just doodling. My previous Note got around 3 days. I have a feeling this will be one of the biggest improvements once I get it rooting and completely tweaked. Charge time is....I don't know. I go to sleep and plug it in, its full once I wake up. Honestly that all I care about. It lasts a day of good use, and is charged when I wake up. I also keep in mind given the hardware and screen res, a full day is pretty acceptable. If I can get it to 1.5 days after tuning, fine by me.Productivity - 4.8Best tablet on the market for it. The added bonus and multi window within multi window? Thats cool. Office program on one side, pdf editor on another, and a small floating youtube window. The reason its not a perfect \"5\" is because the \"pen window\" feature in air command only allow for a few apps to do this. Its NOT every app compatible with multi window. If that changes, Ill be changing this to a 5.Stability - 5I've only had it for a few days. No crashed/freezes yet. If that changes so will my score. I have a feeling a mix of me using Nova Launcher, and only using some pretty well established apps, means I wont have to worry.Overall - 4.6For what this tablet is for, and what it can be once the user puts some tweaking into it, its the best Android tablet on the market.Here is the video of Orrery. Ill probably add one of Atlas 3d in action too. It gives you a good show case of the speakers sound quality, as well as how it handles graphics.[...]", "Date": "October 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "REAL REVIEW", "Author": "Sean", "ReviewID": "R2L9DJT4B05LHP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this a few days ago in black a best buy on the 10th, initially impression are, I love the black, nice quality. My wife has a ipad 4 so I compared them both substantial. The GN 10.1 is lighter, smaller bezels, much louder and better speakers, The screen is better quality overall for sure. I did internet test by going to the same website on both tablets at the same time, I tried about 10 different sites and GN beat the ipad 4 every time with ease sometime double the speed. The battery is about the same as the ipad 4. The S pen is awesome, and I could totally use it for school and just browsing the tablet. Their is slight lag here and there in some things but not even close as laggy as some of the reviews make it out to be, overall I think its extremely fast. I have a Galaxy s 4, and its faster. Mine does not lag on the main screen, or gallery like others. Overall I think its an amazing tablet and totally worth it. Sure the Ipad has better and more apps but its not a productive tablet like this one. The GN has great multi tasking, S pen, many features that make it better.

When I started the device I heard the start up screen but the screen was black although the buttons on the device worked and had a lighted background. Called Samsung support and their response was that I did not charge the device so there was not enough juice to run the screen. Quite honestly this seemed quite idiotic to me and the support person kept insisting I charge the device even after I called to state the problem persisted. I finally got through with another support person who ran  some tests and it was determined that it was a hardware issue and the device needed replacing.Discovered Samsung will not honor the Amazon warranty!! Really Samsung when did the product become Amazon's!!Thankfully because I opened the device I would be able to return it for a refund within the returns window period. Must give kudos to Amazon for their response in returning the defective device. I think a better arrangement has to be made between Samsung and Amazon with regards to the warranty, if I had purchased the device in a store I would have just walked in and got a replacement. With Amazon I have to ensure that it is returned within the 30 day period, taking into consideration I have to drop it off at UPS (ground) and wait till my device arrives at the warehouse and then another device is shipped. Again Amazon customer support was actually great but I after this experience think I will purchase future electronic devices at stores.Well three days before Christmas and off to look for another gift for my girlfriend. Thank you Samsung!!Disclaimer: Before anyone thinks I am bashing Samsung or promoting retail stores. Both my girlfriend and I own multiple Samsung devices and because of busy schedules we purchased a lot of these online from Amazon.

Looks like they are advertising cases just for the 2014 but none of them are available as yet. Also it's nice that they went to a mini USB plug rather then the proprietary one like my old unit but I think it would be better if the connector was on the top or side as you can't stand it up if you have the charger plugged in which the exactly the way I use my old one, which has the same issue so I end up using it upside down.

This year I decided to save my Christmas and birthday money to buy one. So I came to this.The tablet came 90% charged, which was really surprising to me. I never had any device come more than 50% charged. Upon using the device I noticed the screen turning on was slow. I believe Samsung made this as design, and I'm sure there is a way around it if you dig deeper into the system after you root it, but I rather not go that deep.Clicking the home button had a delay when exiting apps. This is because of the S-voice and the magazine feature. Disabling them made it a whole lot faster. But I ended up freezing those applications after I rooted the device, which made the tablet even faster in return.After rooting the device and freezing all the bloatware that it comes with the tablet became a lot smoother and faster. There was no more of that unsmooth pattern unlock which made you mess up, no more battery draining, no more random speed drops, etc... It just became the tablet it should be. I considered returning it before I rooted it because of the performance issue. But now it's not a problem. (Did you know Amazon bans for too many returns? I prefer to keep my returns low.)But of course when you root your device you will void your warranty, which is pretty stupid. They should allow rooting since their the ones that slow down the tablets by putting junk software on it that no one uses. Totally worth it though!One problem is if you have a Anker portable charger. The tablet will not charge on the 2A port, only the 1A port. Unsure why. My Android phone works fine on both ports. If you use the tablet on the 2A port then it will start randomly clicking on the screen somehow. Luckily it's not a phone as it tried to make an emergency call on an application!The screen itself is a fingerprint magnet. Prepare to clean it often. Very often. My Galaxy S4 get's less prints than this tablet. However, the screen is very nice and very sharp. For me anyway. My dad has problems seeing it without glasses.Sound is good, you won't have any problems hearing it. I keep it at max most the time and is pretty loud.

I am well aware of the previous model's drawbacks and I can safely reassure anyone reading this that those shortcomings have all been addressed and resolved. Samsung was listening closely and hard to all its customer's feedback and complaints; and there were a lot because Samsung got it wrong; that being their first generation tablet and all.", "Date": "November 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not Perfect But Close", "Author": "David", "ReviewID": "RUUPBBX9GQ2M6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I would actually give this 4.5 stars. I can't give it 5 because it is not perfect.  I spent 4 months doing research, reading, and watching tons of reviews. I had tried to find reviews that were not biased one way or the other towards Apple or Samsung.  The other tablet I was considering was an IPad Air. If you read a review from a magazine that gets big advertising dollars from either of these guys who are they going to choose? I am familiar with Apple as I own a MacBook Pro, an Ipod touch 5th generation, Apple Tv too, and used to use an IPhone.  I have several Android tablets and a Window 8 tablet too.Which tablet you buy really depends on what you want to use it for.  The IPad Air is a nice tablet.  It has a great display, it is fast, and thin.  Apple apps run very fluid.  Apple has an advantage here since they are the only company who makes their tablet they can more easily optimize the software to hardware. Also developers often design apps with ios in mind first but that is changing. I have noticed that a lot of my ios apps run smoother than the same ones on Android but that gap has really closed.  An IPad is easier to learn than Android.  If you are looking for something to watch videos, browse the Internet,  and check emails it is great. It comes preloaded with Iworks now so you can get a little work done too.Now for the note which is the one I ultimately bought.  I wanted something that I could take notes with and do simple photo edits with. There is more of a learning curve with using the note but it is worth it.  The pen is a great feature.  It is great for note taking, drawing, and comes in handy for photo edits too. I have the 32 gb version with a 64 gb micro sd card installed.  This is not an option with an IPad.  Samsung let's you store apps on the card too.  I loaded photos onto the tablet with a card reader,  did some minor edits, transferred the pics to the external sd card and then copied them to a usb flash drive. You can not do that with an iPad.  Wacom does make a Bluetooth pen for the iPad that works fairly well but not nearly as well as the one on the note. Plus it cost around $100.  A big complaint of the note is there is lag when going from one app to another. It has not been a big deal for me most of the lag is due to the Touchwiz interface that Samsung uses.  However you can make some adjustments like disabling animations or you use a different app launcher like Nova, Apex, or Action which are very straightforward and fast and most of your lag issues will go away. I didn't see that much lag on Touchwiz to be honest but Samsung is trying to do a lot of things with it and a lot of programs run in the background that take up ram. When I loaded another launcher the speed did improve.  I really love the things I am able to do with this thing. You have a lot more freedom using the note vs. an Ipad. Apple IOS is going to be more consistent because Apple is the only company that uses it.  Many companies use Android and they all add there own touches to it that is going make Android less consistent from device to device.It came down to features for the money.  I don't like the Apple gouge factor.  $100 for each increment of storage with no option to add any on your own. A 64 gb card is $37 on Amazon and when they fill up you can just get another one.  I pads will not recognize flash drives and will not let you transfer data to a flash drive or sd card. You can view photos with a card reader but that is all. $100 more for the Bluetooth Wacom pen when a better one is included on the note.  Apple charges a premium price for their tablet and doesn't even offer a camera with a flash.  Then there is the planned obsolescence. I experienced this with my Iphone after 2 years there were a lot of apps that would not run on it. On my MacBook I loaded programs on it and then upgraded to the next os and they no longer worked. I would get messages that power dvd programs were not longer supported. I had to look for updates or redownload programs through the app store. People using the first iPad can't use many of the current apps from the app store. My wife has an Asus transformer several years old that has no problems running most apps. It has been my experience that Apple designs products according to what they think is best for me. For example Apple thinks that I don't need flash so they pretty much ended support for it on many products. They decided I didn't need an optical drive anymore (my MacBook was the last one with a dvd drive included). Of course I can purchase additional storage in ICloud or buy an external drive. Samsung tries to listen to their customers and design products that give them every feature that they want. Maybe even too much so.  If there was a tablet made in the U.S. I would buy it.  At least Samsung does 90% of there work in South Korea rather than shipping 90% of their manufacturing to China and calling themselves an American company. I have a Dell Venue 11 Pro I didn't include it in this review because it is in a different price category and runs a full desktop operating system so I didn't want to compare it with the other two. The Dell can run full desktop apps including Itunes, runs flash,intergrates with office well, and offers many different storage options. The pen is far better on the note and both IOS and Android apps are better than Metro apps.

As I said, spent about two months with this galaxy note 2014 and haven't been disappointed,  but I do have some nit picking for folks looking to purchase should be aware off. First off, my chief annoyance is with the internal gyroscope.  If you have a flip detachable keyboarded case that have magnetic backplate and strips, there no way to use the drop down menu android users are accustom using as the gyroscope is extremely sensitive to anything magnetic and will lock the drop down menu until the tablet is removed from the case. There's no way to turn this off or disable it, plus I read overtime it can permanently damage the gyroscope so please take this into consideration when purchasing a flip case for this tablet. Next is this Samsung My Magazine app that built into the menu button, when navigating the home screen using the menu button WHICH SHOULD bring up the menu screen only to be redirected the My Magazine app, which I mind you cannot be turned off or disabled. My last annoyance is with a great number of app that can't or won't allow for landscape mode or run on the tablet seeing as they were built for smartphones and the tablet option was an add on. Its the same OS platform built android,  how in the heck an app works for one and not the other mind you this is a developer issue. Google controls the platform,  they need to encourage developers to cross build for the android both smartphone and tablet equally.  Now that this is out of the way,  let's get back to the reason I bought the galaxy note 2014. My computer motherboard was faulty and was in need of repair and if your like me everything is done on your computer. So I toiled through online reviews to find a tablet to replace my computer if only temporary with maybe similar accessible features to get through day to day use and top specs hence the galaxy note 2014 tab. It uses Firefox, Pulse news feed, Skype, YouTube, and a host of other apps I use on my tiny 4.2 inch Samsung nexus and places onto a 10.1 inch screen eliminating the constant eye strain and occasional tapping on in app ad's that have no barring to me whatsoever.  I use all these apps on my PC as well, so this was a win-win-win for me. The interface runs smooth with no hitches or hiccups, all apps open within one second upon tapping on them, and the setup is what you'd expect from an Android device. All the 10.1 screen real state does make a difference when using smartphone apps vs tablet apps. This tablet has handled everything I through at it with relative easy and after a day of moderate use I still have just over a half battery charge left to work with. If you're waiting on the new galaxy note or tab pro 12.1 or 8.7, the galaxy note 2014 has the exact same hardware specs pound for pound,  the only difference is the new tab pro run android 4.4 allowing 4 on screen open apps at once, while the galaxy note 2014 runs android 4.3 allow 2 open apps on screen at once if that a big deal too you. Kitkat 4.4 for the 2014 will be out sometime in April after the Samsung galaxy 5 phone is released,  so unless you really need kitkat 4.4 immediately, I'd say get the 2014 as all these 2014 Samsung tablets are the same. If you don't believe me,  checkout the other written and video reviews on the new Samsung tab pro 12.1. With that said, you can also root the 2014 to run a custom 4.4 unofficial kitkat rom with all the kitkat goodness.  All in all,  I'm very pleased with my purchase of the galaxy note 2014 tablet.", "Date": "March 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "I am so so Happy I bought this instead of the iPad Air", "Author": "S.

When I bought my smartphone, my goal was to be able to do about 90% of what I did on my laptop on my smartphone.  After a year of trying to do everything on my smartphone and installing/uninstalling many apps, I came to the conclusion that I was not going to achieve my goal. Having been in the computer business for over 30 years, I surf the Web quite a bit.  This has been my biggest frustration with my razor maxx smartphone...constantly sizing/resizing Web pages and then losing the sizing resulting in starting all over.  Installing apps can solve some of these issues...can't install apps for everything and the space for apps is very limited.  I decided that I could use something between the laptop and the phone which I decided was going to be a tablet.  I also wanted a tablet that would be the best available...have the most innovated features.  After much research, I decided the Note 10.1 from Samsung was it.

The following points are for the replacement I got, which is great![FIRST! Before you set everything up the way you want it, I recommend you install the 2 firmware updates](As of 10-19-13)Pros-Amazing, bright screen-Fast!-Great multitasking capability-Application partition seams much larger so you can install TONS of apps(can move some to microSD if needed as well)-Battery life(I get a solid 9-12+ hours)[5-6 of heavy use with high screen brightness]-Battery charge time[5 hours from completely dead to %100](My Galaxy Tab 10.1 took about 6.5 hours and my Asus TF700T takes about 6)-Using the S-Pen is more responsive than previous Note products, and very accurate-Current Software[Android 4.3](This does mean, there may be kinks to work out)-Lightweight/small for a 10.1 inch screen[significantly smaller than my Galaxy Tab 10.1 and my TF700T] This makes it much easier to hold and use for extended periods of time-A non-proprietary charging/data port[MicroUSB](YAY!!! So nice to not carry multiple chargers)-Speakers sound better than ANY other tablet speakers I have heard, including all iPads, and they're loud[This is still not going to output sound good enough for casual music/videos](Being side-mounted helps hearing them when it's lying flat)-Cameras are good, not awesome, but works in a pinch, or for video calls[Equal to the camera quality of a Galaxy S 3]-The faux leather back feels nice and the tablet feels more solid than previous Samsung devices with no creeking/flexing or movement-Expandable memory through MicroSD card slotCons[mostly nit-picking]-Wish it had the Snapdragon 800 that the Note 3 has[Would solve the terrible gallery performance]-Wish it had the same updated Camera app as the Note 3-Some software still needs time to get better-High res screen sometimes means while surfing the web and in some apps, my finger is too big to make a selection so I have to use the S-pen even though I have average sized fingers-Lack of accessories[Samsung should have a few accessories made for this by the time they release it IMO]-Having the capacitive back/menu buttons is inconvenient when using the tablet in portrait mode-The Touchwiz gallery app is TERRIBLE, it draws thumbnails every time you open the app, so if you have lots of photos, it hangs/lags sotyhty bad that it can render the device unusable.[I use QuickPic and it handles everything fine](For people that dont have 4K+ photos you will still likely need to disable weather/buddy tagging, dropbox photo displaying, Google+ photo syncing/displaying, Facebook photo syncing/sharing and clear the app cache for the gallery to get decent performance from the stock gallery)-I wish the battery charging was faster[It may get a little better with time as I have only charged it a few times]-I wish it had the USB 3.0 port that the Note 3has, but file x-fers aren't too bad-I wish it had a full USB port, and perhaps, a microHDMI so I didn't have to use donglesOverallLike I have stated, this is the best tablet I have ever owned, among several. I would definitely recommend buying this over any other 10.1 inch Android tablet on the market even though it is more expensive than many.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Testing for company rollout - Need the pen, this is for you", "Author": "Sean P.", "ReviewID": "R6DCL9B9D33PZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Before I write anything, I wanted to comment about reviews people leave on a device OS vs the device itself.It appears that for anyone dropping $600 on a tablet, who has not had the experience of Android, or at least tried it out beforehand, should be committed to a prison for the ignorant.There are a LOT of Android tablets, and I am going to review this unit vs. the iPad 3 that we have here in the house.  I have an iPad 2 for work but wife has the iPad 3 so better comparison.I've owned the following tablets:Lenovo Android 1st GenSamsung Galaxy Tab 1st GenMotorola XoomNexus 7Apple iPad 2 and 3Amazon Kindle Fire 1st GenWe as a company changed over to Google Apps 4 years ago and I find it an excellent platform that surpasses anything Microsoft puts out in total.  Cross functional with Microsoft Apps as they have refined the software and works very well for business users, unless you need a heavy graphics type software.That being said, this tablet is by FAR the best tablet I've used, in the short period of time that I have been testing it.I take a lot of notes in business meetings, and I am also a heavy Evernote user/Google Drive user.This tablet integrates beautifully with Evernote.  The S Note feature alone makes this tablet a winner for those that prefer to write notes during meetings and not look like a fool banging away on an iPad screen which can really be distracting especially if you have one on one meetings with a client.The Pen itself is extremely comfortable to handle, it writes smoothly, and if you choose, converting to text is VERY accurate, and I really do have Chicken Scratch like handwriting.  That said, it's not flawless, but pretty damned close.The hardware is excellent, it's buttery smooth when moving from screen to screen, and app to app.  Not sure how others complain of lag, but then again, I've only had it for 7 days so maybe it bogs down over time.  Thus far, that's not been the case.It's very light...can easily hold in one hand although it's not designed or meant to be used that way.I used QuickOffice Pro HD, Polaris that it comes with, as well as Google Drive for all my word processing, PPT, and Excel needs.  All of these will work just fine for the average business user.The colors on the device are FAR superior to my iPads 2 and 3...I read somewhere that someone felt the colors were muted or not that bright but I suspect the user had the brightness turned WAY down because this just blows away my iPads.  My wife, a long time Apple Loyalist, agrees with me that this tablet is brighter and just looks better when looking at movies, internet videos, etc.We looked at pictures, the exact same pictures, on both the iPad and Galaxy Note 10.1 and no question that while the iPad does look great, this tablet is just better overall.  We looked at them over and over and while to the average user you might not care or notice, I did.Now, I too am invested in the Apple Ecosystem...We have an Apple TV and a lot of movies and music purchased that we access.I also have company issued iPad.  I use the Apple TV and airplay to do wireless presentations, and it works great.However, I always laugh when Apple tries to tout their App Store as so much far superior in content than Android.  Yeah, if you need a lot of fart apps, and apps that don't really mean a whole lot to the AVERAGE user, than sure.  But overall, all the major apps, companies that have apps, have one for both Apple and Android at this point.  So that's just a stupid useless comparison based solely on numbers.The experience of using this Note vs Apple is where there is the major difference.  The Note for me just feels better when using it.  I feel like I'm using a professional device for a true professional.  I can see where with students, this would be even better, with the variety of note taking capability that the S-Pen offers.S-Note, Action Memo, Scrap Booking features are just excellent for anyone that needs to take notes.  And the AutoDesk Sketchbook app is fantastic, although I will probably use it less than others because I'm not an artist.  My daughter used it and drew beautiful pictures and now she's constantly asking for me to use it.Another feature I like is the WatchON app that came with it.  I control by TV and Directv receiver with it, but the content it offers is excellent...tracking my favorite programs and easily recording or even watching them if the service is available is a snap.I watched for about 30 minutes Prometheus on this and it was flawless.Apple is a great product...no question, but really, at the end of the day, it's more an entertainment device than that for a serious professional.  I'm sure you can try, like I did with the keyboards and various apps to make it a professional device, and it can be customized if you'd like, especially if you're 100% invested in the Apple Ecosystem, but I didn't want to be married to one.I have the Galaxy Note 3 for my phone as well, so I have both Android for work, and Apple for play.If you are a professional who finds they need a tablet for note taking, multi tasking, or a student that needs notes for classes or artistry, this is the tablet for you.  If you want a tablet to just watch movies and videos, or listen strictly to music and play games on, I'd recommend the iPad.This 10.1 2014 edition is sleek, fast, multi functional, has the min SD card slot as well for that extra storage, can handle all the movies I through at it, and looks fantastic..feels great in the hand, much lighter than any Android tablet I've had in the past except maybe the Nexus 7...I'll be testing it over the next 3 weeks to make sure it still performs as it should..but for now, very little to complain about.PROS:LightFast ProcessorPen Ability far superior to othersResponsiveProfessional look and build qualityBuilt in Speakers are loud and clear..better than many tablets on marketColors are beautifulBoot time less than 30 seconds.CONS:ExpensiveWish Pen had an alert like Note 3 to let you know if you left it outPen feels almost too light (doesn't affect performance)Not a whole lot of accessories for it.EDIT... UPGRADE TO 5 STARS. WHY?Battery life is outstanding.  I'm getting well over a full day of really heavy use. That's constant email, note taking, browsing, Pandora and podcasts running in background. I don't do video games so cannot comment on that but for heavy business use I'm unplugging at 530am,reading WSJ and NY Times, watching video highlights on ESPN, checking emails for hours, typing emails, and taking notes during calls.  My screen is on more than half the time and by time I plug in at 11pm I'm still at 25% battery left.I also watched movie for 2 hours on flight and under same circumstances still had 15% left.Brightness is at about 50% and wifi constantly on.  Fantastic battery life.UPDATE :  BIG UPDATEWell, I'm frustrated now after having this for a couple months.What's happening?  For whatever reason, I need to reboot the tablet every single day.  I can feel it get VERY hot in back, and then, the clock stops working and it starts to lag.I did a full factory reset and that worked..for 2 days...and it started all over again.  And I did not have apps reinstalled on it.  So it's NOT an app issue.I don't know what is happening but this has become so frustrating now.Everything else I stand by, but how the hell can you give this a high rating when this continues to happen with no fix?", "Date": "November 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "AMAZINGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG FAST", "Author": "Carter \"O.C.\"", "ReviewID": "R25CJUYY2PUUI8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros: This tablet is really beautiful...

Hence 4.  My focus is on practicality.  I will probably never watch a movie or read a novel on this device. This is a good, light device with great potential for note taking and use as a portable sketch book.  Let down by poor hardware (sd card reader is inoperable*) and suboptimal UI decisions.[*Update 2 February 2014 - in the past month or so the SD card reader seems to be reading the card that is in there properly.  However, I have not tried swapping it over]DiscussionI have a complex relationship w my note. When I first received it, its apparent heavy reliance or Wifi was a big turn off. I want the device primarily as a mobile sketchpad where I don't need to be tethered to the net. I would also like to get work stuff (reviewing and drafting documents) done on it. Overall I am happy with the tablet despite its failings. I do not propose to focus on its strengths other than to say overall I've rated it 4 stars and the more I use it the more I like it.  Rather, let me list some of the issues I have faced with the tablet in my first week of use.If there is lag, I haven't noticed it.  In sketch if you sweep the s pen around the screen (with a small nib)  the pen will be 1-2cm behind the pen tip. As you slow down it catches up.  When sweeping slowly the follow distance is 2-3mm.  The only lag which I think might be of practical importance is the page turn lag in the S pen, but I haven't had a chance to take notes in meetings with it yet.Issues with note 10.1Many application features are difficult to discover.  Always press the menu button, just in case!It is good to be able to take hard written notes w/out them being converted into text (conversion takes too long, particularly if correcting mistakes).  The handwriting recognition is not good enough - at least fed my writing (this was handwritten, but subsequently heavily edited, \"fed\" is just there for a feel of the errors (for)).  The virtual keyboard is bad for characters like ' \" () because each time you want one of these characters it requires 3 key presses (symbol keyboard, symbol, alpha keyboard buttons).  This is a very serious problem for me. These are commonly used glyphs. It makes me wonder whether this software is used by actual people before being released. Also of concern is the lack of arrow keys or the virtual keyboard. I assume the designers decided you could just tap the screen with your s pen.  This is an exercise in frustration.  Hunting the screen for the right tap spot is much harder than hitting the arrow keys a couple of times. Autocorrect generally works well - but sometimes quite poorly. No easy way to correct a bad autocorrect.  The hardware buttons are not good. I hit them too often, esp using the device flat on a table. Turning the device upside down doesn't quite solve the issue because you obscure the light sensor and the screen goes dim.  Using handwriting is slow compared to typing on the virtual keyboard.  That, in turn, is slow compared to typing on a proper keyboard. On the upside there's something therapeutic about writing your notes.  I have turned off the button on the S Pen because I kept pressing it accidentally when writing.The S Note application uses a weird page size - apparently you're supposed to keep adding these tiny pages (note taking size is roughly equivalent to card file cards).  When you turn the tablet from landscape to portrait mode, you just get the small card across the width, rather than a full portrait screen to do your note taking on.  [Edit: use a portrait template when creating a new note - thanks Eddard - an example of press the menu button I mention above] Export to text is not available(!) (it exports image files or pdfs, you can also share the text by email) - you can get the text by selecting it and copying it to the clipboard though.  Turning a page takes a tediously long time (although still only a second or two).  Annoying because it is presumably deliberately included for effect.Polaris office was woeful the last time I tried it. It looks like the new version has improved dramatically.  I haven't used it extensively though.It is hard to get a soft touch with s pen.  I would like to be able to configure the pressure curve for the s pen but this seems to be impossible.  Light pressure seems better in Clover paint than in  Galaxy sketch.The device doesn't come with an epub reader installed (?!)I have bad SD card issues*[see note above] - apparently a known issue w/ Samsung tablets - google \"SD card unexpectedly removed\". I have tried it with 2 SD cards now. It corrupted the first one. The second one is new and it will not read the card or even recognise that a card has been inserted. Yes, I have tried reformatting it - to within an inch of its life. It makes no difference.  The SD card reader is inoperable. The sd card is readable if connected via a card reader and a usb otg cable.My usb ethernet dongle does not work when connected by a usb otg cable.  Despite having wired internet available it insists on wireless.The Knox system looks interesting. I may use it but it is more designed to allow you corporate IT staff to quarantine data. Eg. I'd actually like to be able to move files from the Knox container to the public one, but I can't. Rather I have to email the file to myself, using up my data allowance.  What I really want is a per-file or per-directory encryption system.  If the SD card reader worked I could apparently use that as an encrypted container <sigh>.  There are only a handful of apps available for use in the Knox container.ConclusionDespite the very annoying failure of the sd card reader* my general impression of the device is very favorable.  I am a little concerned that it will either tie me to online services or lock my data in weird formats.  That said I am reasonably confident that I will be able to keep my data free.", "Date": "November 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just like the Galaxy Note Phone... only BETTER!", "Author": "Tara \"peacefulseraph\"", "ReviewID": "R23RMZS2E9RZ0X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I finally got my Galaxy Note tablet home and, wow- the product is amazing!

Of course, I'm upgrading from a Kindle Fire 7\" so everything looks bigger and better... but I think anyone can appreciate this device (no matter what they've upgraded from).If you have the Galaxy Note phone, transitioning to this tablet is super easy in that the user interface is practically the same. And once you link your Google account, it automatically downloads all compatible apps to your device for you. You'll still need to download Amazon apps individually- but you'll need to allow downloads from \"unknown sources\" to get them. Some anti virus programs (like Mcafee, Webroot, and Kaspersky) will make a big fuss over this- but if you want, there's a new feature that allows you to make a \"one time download\" without changing security settings permanently.With programs like Sketchbook Pro out there, I can't imagine that anyone could get bored with their s-pens. This tablet will be competing with some heavy hitters this year like the new mobile Wacom Cintiq. This is less than half the price... but whether it stacks up in p.p.i. and pen recognition?

fulfillment arrived in a box full of small paper flakes. They were all over the device, sticking to the protective screen sticker provided by the manufacturer for transport. Not only were they all over the device and sticking to the side stickers, but I found them under the screen's protective sticker as if no one cared there was dust/paper flakes all over it. Part of the Samsung label on the back of the device appears faded due to sliding around in the box during shipping.I chose a white 32 GB Note because I prefer it over black. Right away I noticed the top of my device by the camera has this red blemish. Upon closer inspection I noticed that whomever attached the front bezel of the Note didn't align the stuff under it correctly, so what I'm seeing is the leading lines for placement under the front bezel which is visible if you're looking at the Note from the side or flat on its back.After wiping off all the paper flakes that came with the device and blowing air gently into the power port, the audio port (which has a HUGE hole compared to the Samsung Galaxy S3's audio port), I powered up the device. As with most devices, I figured it'd have a little power to turn on, but this one did not. I plugged it in and went about setting it up. Not thirty minutes out of the box and all the applications start crashing on me. They start to error out, unable to find location, unstable internet (which was fine according to my phone) and that google.services were unable to function.I pulled my hair out for a bit, read some Android forums and figured out how to do a manufacturer's reset. Everything appears to be working now, but that was a headache upon receiving it. Had I been an average user with no experience in computers/devices, I'd have shipped it back up in frustration and returned it. The blemish bothers the heck out of me, but I'd rather not have to receive another box of paper debris and risk getting a scratched screen, just for a cosmetic issue. Going to try it out for a few days, see how it does, then decide if I should return it.Update: Feb 13, 2014: Sitting with Samsung Support trying to get my device to load the Samsung App and Samsung Hub application to no avail. I have the apps on my Galaxy S3 Phone which work, but they aren't loading on my Note. They error out with \"common error on product search\" and \"Service Unavailable (1009). Unable to find your location. Check your network settings and try again.\" Technician had me create a whole new Samsung account just to test the device, but it isn't loading either way.7:57 pm - Amazon is overnight shipping me a new Galaxy Note 10.1 (2014) edition after Samsung Technical Support suggested I replace it since it was brand new and malfunctioning. Amazon's customer service is amazing because I thought I'd have to wait a few days for a replacement. I already shipped the defective device back today, so I'm glad to see I'll have a new one in the mail tomorrow without the red blemish and hopefully without any WiFi/GPS connection problems that were messing up the Samsung App/Hub processes. Will update with another review when I receive the new device.Updated: Feb 14, 2014: Straight out of the box I noticed my replacement has a scratch on the bottom left silver bezel. The speaker cover plates are loose and jiggle when you move the Note around. You can tap them gently and they'll wiggle loose. The previous Note 10.1 (2014) did not have loose speaker plates, therefore I can't believe this is \"working as intended\" or was designed like this.Turning the Note on, it went through several updates unlike the previous Note, but still could not connect to Samsung Apps or Samsung Hub. In addition, this Note is hot to the touch unlike the previous one I replaced. I'm about ready to ask for a refund and try my luck with in-store purchases instead. This is ridiculous, the headache has made me reduce this by another star.Bonus Extras FYI: Dropbox will not give you the full 50GB of storage space if you have a pre-existing account. Any GB you earned from Referrals won't matter after you link it with your Bonus offer for Galaxy Perks.Update: Feb 15, 2014: Returned my device to Amazon through the pre-paid label. I asked for a refund to be issued. In the meantime, I went with Samsung's suggestion to purchase the Note from an \"authorized\" vendor, as apparently Amazon.com is not considered by them an authorized dealer (who knew?), and headed to Best Buy. The Samsung employees there hired to work at Best Buy listened to my story, they let me test the device right there with them. No scratches, no blemishes, no paper flakes in the package. Screen's protection sticker was absolutely fine without any debris in it like the first two I purchased from Amazon. Straight out of the package, it had a full charge, no problems getting it signed up on the Samsung account, updated, all the apps worked in the store. Device itself did not get burning hot to the touch like the second replacement I was sent. All the parts on it were in good working order, no loose pieces or otherwise visible defects. S-Pen worked like a charm, quick to respond to the button tap near the screen, worked flawlessly.My only problem with it was once I got home the Samsung Hub had an \"unknown error\" again and crashed. I'm wondering if the Samsung Hub itself isn't working properly and the server is dropping or if there's an issue with my router and the Note because the Samsung Galaxy S3 phone works fine on WiFi with the Samsung Hub application.Why am I so determined I wanted a Note 10.1 (2014) instead of an iPad Air when they're relatively the same price?The expandable memory for the SD card is one. The fact I can plug my Note into the computer via micro USB and retrieve files. It can NFC with my phone among other Samsung things. It has the ability to flawlessly render my handwriting into text format, port it (handwriting and all) to PDF format then send it to Evernote. There's the fact I can not only use the tablet for hand writing my notes, but I can also use it to draw sketches. It's definitely a useful device for someone who spends most of their day sketching, writing, or researching. The S-Pen permits you to take snapshots of whatever you're looking at and save it to a scrapbook backed up on the Samsung account you link your device with. You can also take a screen capture and doodle on it with the S-Pen then send it off to someone or save it.Since the device itself is 10.1 inches of real estate with the capacity of adjusting your stylus width/type you can virtually do whatever you need with S-Note. From using a pen, pencil, brush, various colors, types of lines, etc. I really wanted this without having to buy a stylus, multiple applications, and so forth. Dual window screen is great for someone trying to copy and paste data from an e-mail to another program or even just comparing information.So far I liked the price, the features available, and customization versus the high price and lack of expansion with the iPad.", "Date": "February 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "IMPRESSIVE TABLET", "Author": "Lou", "ReviewID": "R2YG3IQTM265UA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a big fan of Samsung products and I currently own the Galaxy Note 3 and the original Note 10.1 tablet. When the 2014 edition of the Note came out, I was eager to explore the high resolution screen and the many features that make the Note such a great tablet. Being aware that the Note Pro 12.2 is about to be released, boasting of a larger screen size and a more windows-like display, I seriously thought of waiting to check out this larger tablet. However, trying to be practical, the Note 2014, for me, lighter-weight and slightly smaller in size (not screen size though), the portability of the tablet is really important to me. I bought the tablet a couple of days ago and am quite impressed and very happy with this product. I was able to sync the tablet, through my Samsung account (with MUCH help from my tech-savvy son) and to my surprise, was able to get all my saved S-Notes onto my new tablet. An app called File Manager, a free download from the play store, was needed and well utilized in making this transition possible. And on the Samsung website, an S-Note Reader program can be downloaded for free onto any PC, allowing you to read your S-Notes on your computer. Again, all credit goes to my son, whose patience for this is extraordinary. A lot of trial and error initially, along with some scary (I thought I lost ALL my S-Notes) and frustrating moments, it all worked out well in the end. I have barely begun to explore the many new and improved features of this tablet, and I was quite satisfied with the original Note 10.1 (which I happily passed along to my son). I rely heavily on the S-Note application to take many notes, create many folders, etc., both for business use (primarily) and for personal use as well. I LOVE the S-PEN, which now I cannot live without. While always attracted to the iPad with Retina Display, the lack of note-writing capability on the iPad and most other tablets, is a big disadvantage to me. The Surface Pro was also something I seriously considered, but with enough windows computers and being I am so very comfortable with the Note, I am sticking with this tablet. I also purchased the specially designed Samsung cover/case for this tablet, which I am also very happy with. It is really slick-looking and when you lift the cover open, it wakes up the tablet. All necessary ports are conveniently exposed. The screen resolution is beautiful, text is so easy to read and videos stand out beautifully. I was also able to install Adobe Flash Player from the Adobe website, which, for me, just ,makes life a lot easier. All the apps I had installed on my original Note 10.1 were automatically placed on the new tablet once I set it up. Wi-Fi connections work very well also, so I have no complaints so far. I will update this review if I come across any issues, but so far, so good. If you like Samsung products, I would highly recommend this tablet.

I don't think I'll ever go back to anything but s-pens.  The Samsung apps that utilize the s pen are also good.  I wish there were a setting so whenever the pen is removed, only the pen will touch buttons and not the finger or hand.  They have that partially in some apps.- SD card. In the app options, it says you can move apps to the SD card, but I'm not sure how to verify that it works.  A warning: when I checked out, Amazon recommended a 64GB micro sd card.  The specifications say it only accepts 32GB.  I bought a Samsung 32GB, so I haven't tested whether 64GB works, but I wouldn't risk it.  I bought a Samsung micro SD card because it's faster than SanDisc.- Great speakers.  I'm a musician, and was worried about complaints others made, but I think they're great.  I mean, they're not exactly surround sound, but what do you expect from a tablet?  It's loud enough and clear enough for my purposes.- Good camera.  I'm no photographer, but I thought the camera was a good quality.- Thin and light.  I haven't had much experience with tablets, but I was happy with the size.- Great perks.  I don't know how long they'll offer the perks, but I got good stuff like DropBox space, Google Play credit, credit toward entertainment in the Samsung Hub, etc.- The IR blaster is cool (TV remote), but it's hard to find a good app that uses it.  I finally found one, but it was a long search.- Big screen with good quality.  If you like to watch movies in the dark, you might want to turn the brightness auto adjust off, because in the dark, the screen also goes dark.  For movies, that usually doesn't work too well.  When you turn the brightness to your liking, the quality is great.- I also like that you can have two apps side by side, or mini floating window apps.  Not all apps can do these - actually most can't, but many of the important ones can.Neutral/Maybe:- The pen is small to hold, but that is to be expected.- There are other tablets with 64GB + SD card.  I'm not close to running out of space yet, but I like to have it just to have it.- I'd like to see better power options.  There is a power saving mode you can turn on and off.  My phone has options to keep the screen on when it's plugged in.  I'd like that for the tablet.  I'd also like it to turn power saving mode off when it's plugged in, and perhaps turn power saving mode on when it's not plugged in.  When it's fully charged, it displays a message saying to unplug it from the charger.  From my reading, it's just an odd attempt at being green.- The speed is what I expected.  It hasn't really lagged too much.  You have to change a setting so the screen rotates faster.  Just remember that it is a tablet, not a computer.  In general remember that.  If you want to type, use a keyboard.  A tablet is for portability, but bigger and fancier than a smartphone.Cons:- I haven't been that happy with the Samsung software and apps.  They haven't been what the videos say they are.  I have a Samsung laptop, but I can't stream video to it like I though I could.  Unless you have the right Samsung TV or box, don't plan on streaming movies or pictures to your TV.- Along with the last complaint, there is no HDMI port.  There are adapters for other models, but not for this one.- When you press home when you're already home, it takes you to read the news.  You can't change this option.  I'm sorry to say, I'm not that interested in the news.  I keep pressing it by mistake, and having to go back.  I wish you could choose which app that shortcut would open.", "Date": "November 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Galaxy Note vs. iPad Air vs. Kindle HDX 8.9 - Galaxy comes closest to PC replacement.", "Author": "AmazonDiva \"Keep Calm and Carry On.\"", "ReviewID": "R21PT0IMY13GY6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have used all three devices - Galaxy Note vs. iPad Air vs. Kindle HDX 8.9 - for several months and each device has it own pros and cons based on how you use the device and what you'd like to do with it. The Samsung Note gives a pretty decent experience overall and excels on many features, and from then on it's a matter of preference.I still prefer my iPad for magazine/text book/newspaper reading due to it's shape that makes it easy. I also find it the best for surfing the internet although Galaxy Note is not far behind. Kindle's silk browser is slooow, and I would never use it. Chrome works fine on all and you can change the settings to use Chrome. iPad is also my tablet of choice for sketching apps. The Galaxy Tab comes with a pen but I don't find it as responsive as iPad for my sketching, although it might just be because I am more used to the iPad with a stylus. I can't even think about the same on Kindle as the interface seems slow and unresponsive, it's improved quite a bit with Kindle HDX but there is still ways to go.For watching movies I prefer Kindle HDX 8.9 as it's the lightest of the three and has the best resolution and streaming is pretty seamless. The sound is perhaps the best of all devices but if you're using headphones it doesn't matter. Galaxy Note and iPad make the Chromecast streaming pretty seamless unlike the Kindle HDX, so if you're using your tablet to watch a movie on another screen keep that in mind.When you're holding the tablet the weight really makes a difference and for this reason I like to read books on my Kindle HDX 8.9. Although, nothing beats the Kindle Paperwhite for reading novels.Another thing about Galaxy Tab is that it's convenient to have a pen right on the tablet. The pen offers many point and click functions, but I just wish they were a little more user friendly and unobstrusive, so far I prefer to use my finger unless I am using a specific app that requires the pen. I was excited about the feature that turns handwriting to typed text but in reality it has a learning curve and is still not very intuitive. Right now I don't see an advantage over iPad if you're using a good stylus.If you're considering how to decide between iPad and Galaxy, the first thing you have to consider is the eco-system. If you've been using an Android phone the transition to Galaxy Note is seamless. But if you're an iPhone owner you may find the Android interface not as user friendly as it's not as simple and intuitive but offers more flexibility. If you have many apps that you love and use on iOS for example the Garage Band or iMovie then you may want to buy the iPad - these apps are now free with iPad Air.The other thing to consider is storage and importing files. The Galaxy Note allows you to put in a mini SD card to expand storage. That makes also it very convenient to access files on the Galaxy. However, with Dropbox and direct streaming from many sites the need for expanded storage is diminished. There are also now many products out there that function that don't need WiFi to create a network expand storage on the iPad.The Kindle HDX has a closed eco-system that does not allow any outside apps like Nook, iBooks in books or music from iTunes. I am especially frustrated by not being able to read my magazines in one place as there are separate apps required for each magazine. iPad's newstand integrates all magazine apps for one seamless experience. Kindle HDX is most useful if you have more content from Amazon. But it's cheaper and has a pretty decent email interface and a free Office app so it can be used as a multi-purpose device. It also has a send to Kindle feature that allows you to \"print\" any doc to your Kindle. I love that feature.Overall, the Galaxy Note is a very useful device with the most features of all three and is the most flexible. However, I use it the least. My main tablet usage is surfing the internet, reading magazines/newspapers, watching movies/TV, editing photos and the iPad is still my go-to device due to it's shape, speed, and app eco-system. Kindle HDX is next for it's video-viewing and all the content I have from Amazon. Samsung Galaxy Note though versatile is not my go-to device for any one thing - so it loses out. However, it comes the closest to a PC replacement if I did more office work on my tablet so I still like having it around especially when I travel.The Galaxy Note came with a ton of freebies like Google Play and Samsung Store credit, expanded Dropbox for 2 years, Boingo membership for one year, Businessweek subscription for a year, Hulu Plus membership for 3 months which was very nice. No other device offered all these freebies so if they're still being offered when you buy the tablet, factor that into the cost.", "Date": "February 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "another winner", "Author": "Mary F.

I have also owned nearly every Samsung tablet, many  Kindles, Nooks, and have the Ipad 2 and had the ipad mini (first mini).  So, i'm well rounded.  To think i went into technology kicking and screaming in the early 2000's!This tablet is awesome.  I've definitely note explored all of the features yet on it because at the present time i also own the Note 8 and my phone is the Note 3.  I've also for the first time learned how to sync my SNotes with Evernote; that may sound basic, but i didn't know how to do it and now someone at Best Buy spent time with me helping me learn.I own the Note series because I like Android -- for those who say that there are many more choices in the apple app stores i say how many apps does one really need?  Everything i look for is available in the Play store.The multi window function is great, although i don't make use of it as  often as those who work might.  I retired a few years ago. I buy the series because of the S pen.  I keep a journal, and enjoy handwriting it.  I love keeping one on papeer, but when i am traveling without my large backpack/messenger bag, i can handwrite on this.  I also use the SNote function to keep a grocery list on my phone.  I save all kinds of things in Scrapbook, such as tips from a great source called Dripler (in the Google Play store).  I also like the fact that when i do my banking, i can, using the Spen, bring up a calculator on the check page to do my checkbook balancing.This baby comes with a lot of perks.  Off the bat i received a credit for $25 in the Play store, $50 in the Samsung Hub store, free magazines from Zinio (i don't get the crredit because i already have the app -- by the way, many public libraries have Zinio -- magazines -- available for checkout and unlike books, when a magazine is checked out, you keep the magazine), a 3-month Audible trial for audio books in Amazon (again, because i already have an account, i am not eligible), and 50G of free dropbox storage.  And, a free 3month trial of the NYTimes. Samsung says these freebies are worth $600.I'm not wild about the price, but if i held off for a while, the price would come down.  I thought and thought about whether to get this new 10.1 2014 Note since i currently have and use the Note 8, as well as my phone.  I also use my ipad, but because it is in a leather keyboard folio, it is heavy to cart around if i just want to lighten my load.  Yes, i can remove it from the folio.  But an advantage of android is the Swype feature -- being able to slide my fingers from letter to letter on the keyboard.  It is easier than the hunt and peck typing method on the on-screen keyboard of the ipad.  I do have several portable keyboards, but the one i'm currently using when i want a keyboard is an excellent one by Brookstone.  I have the one with the little shelf which can hold a device on it.  But because the keyboard can be removed, i can simply slide this slim full-size keyboard in my bag if i want to.  The whole thing is lighter than my keyboard folio for the ipad.  Many small bluetooth keyboards are weird -- when i type on them foreign symbols pop up and i have to select what i want, slowing down the typing.  I'm a good typist, and the brrokstone is simply a regular but lighthweighth keyboard.I highly recommend this tablet. It is fun, good for professionals, comes with great features and lots of 3-month expensive freebies, and it has -- oh yeah -- an expandable memory, unlike the fruit tablets. That is also a big selling point.  I have all of my music on a micro card and can simply put the card into the Note series.You can't go wrong.

If 1/2 stars were possible, then I'd give it 4.5 because of the high price tag. I work in academia and run my own research lab. I have to attend various meetings and many other functions that require a lot of thoughts to be thrown around, saved, and eventually have to follow-up on them. I've owned a Galaxy Tab 10.1 (first generation), Google Nexus 10, and Apple iPad 3, trying to be patient with the Note series until it matured and wasn't yet sold on the idea of the S-Pen let alone a generic stylus. Well, it has matured and has the muscle behind it. The S-Pen feature is what separates this tablet apart from the aforementioned tablets, as they all were simply media consumption devices and had no further usefulness beyond checking email and watching videos. I'm not a game player, so I really don't care for this aspect. The built-in Samsung apps are very basic and don't offer a great experience. Thus, I felt compelled to look beyond the Sammie ecosystem. Thus, I downloaded a free Android app called, \"Papyrus,\" paid for a few premium features costing around $3 each, and I have never looked back. Note-taking with this app complements the capabilities of the S-Pen very well. The pen is sensitive and responsive enough to feel like natural hand writing -- granted, it is not absolutely perfect, but for what it's worth, it is great. The Papyrus app does what it's supposed to without being too gimmicky and cute like other writing apps.Pros:1. Quickly, easily, and accurately write down important notes and save or convey/share those thoughts to others.2. Mirror my tablet on an HD television screen in a meeting room and write everything so people can collaborate / review in real time.3. Export or share notes in various formats (PDF, PNG, JPG) via email, SMS, and the usual set of sharing mediums.4. With #3 above, I find it very useful to MMS my notes, as it reduces the need for typing a full-blown message. Anyone with a tablet knows that typing stinks, no matter what brand you have. Steve Jobs was completely wrong about the utility of the stylus!5. S-Pen is very accurate and responsive. You can also lay your palm on the screen while writing and there's no \"background\" pickup. It can be accessed easily and stored discretely.6. Tablet has the hardware specs capable of handling what I need to do -- use productivity apps, watch videos/movies on the plane, and a whole lot more!7. Did I mention that the screen resolution is awesome? Well, it's awesome!Cons:PriceBuilt-in Samsung S-Pen apps still weak -- find yourself some other Android appsIf you are serious about being productive at work while also being able to enjoy \"intense\" multimedia, then this device will not let you down.

As a Graphic Design student I cannot express how useful this tablet is. The pen uses a Wacom digitizer. Instead of hauling my Wacom tablet to class every day, I just take the tablet to create digital works, which I can then port to Photoshop, Illustrator, or whatever. The stylus is far superior to those which work with an iPad, and you save money by having a stylus that is built in to this tablet. If you are an artist or an art student looking for a tablet that will increase your productivity I highly suggest the Note over the iPad. I know that Apple computers are the industry standard in the Art world, but this tablet should be the exception to that \"rule\". Art kids, abandon your Apple tablets and get yourself a Note.Speaking of Note! The note taking capabilities of this tablet are amazing. For once, I'm an organized note taker. I have abandoned the lined paper notebook and I use this tablet solely for note taking in my Art History classes. I love how I can drag pictures into my notes, which is absolutely a bonus, and an important feature in helping me learn Art History.

The additional items that Samsung is playing up in their advertisement as being $600 of free stuff, is complete garbage. The $50 credit they give you for the Samsung hub is a joke, the bookstore has nothing worth purchasing except garbage books, the App Store that Samsung has is complete joke also. The only added value is the 25 dollar credit with Google Play. Everything else you're going to get a free trial and then they want you to get a subscription with a monthly fee. So it's a complete marketing scam by Samsung to get you to buy this tablet.2. Okay now is the tablet worth $550 for the 32mb version? I would say yes.3. The other reason I do not rate this a five star is because its not running the latest version of Android. You would think, at least I would think, that if this is your flag ship model that research and development would have worked endless hours to give you the latest updated edition since its release last year. But no it's still running Androd Jelly Bean 4.3 which is not a bad thing but when you're spending this kind of money you would expect a and company like Samsung to be at the top of their game.4. Why did I pick Samsung over the iPad? The biggest reason I got this tablet was because of the stylus s-pen verses touch only types of tablet. If Apple had a tablet with a stylus with Wacom technology similar to this one I more than likely I would have gone with the iPad, reason being is their updates seem to come out faster from their R&D; division. For some reason Android products seem to be hit or miss on whether you're going to get an update or not or if you do get the update it takes forever, this tablet was released October 2013 and it still does not have the KitKat update for Android how ridiculous is that.5. So how does the tablet work? After I purchased the tablet I went to the Samsung store and I purchased the Bluetooth keyboard and the USB adapter. I have to say this almost works as good as a laptop with the keyboard and the USB adapter. I am able to plug in my portable 2tb external hard drive by Western Digital, this is a huge plus being a photographer that this little tablet can actually power my external hard drive for when I want to show images to clients. Again the keyboard is an awesome addition if you wanna sit and type something verses using the S-pen or finger typing.Final note, I'm going to give this tablet a chance and hope the updates come out soon and the biggest test is going to see if later this year probably several several months from now when Android 4.5 is released if this tablet gets updated to that version. The last thing I want to do is be spending this type of money every year and a half to two years when a new update for Android comes out and the company doesn't support the upgrades. I have that issue with Toshiba Thrive 10 inch tablet this was a very promising tablet but once they got to Android Ice Cream Sandwich version they stopped. There were no more updates, no more support which was truly disappointing since I really enjoyed the Toshiba company. But when companies do not take care of their clients, the ones that support them they will lose them. Case in point as for me I will never purchase a Toshiba item again, I am currently very very happy with this Samsung tablet.Does this tablet have value that an Apple iPad air does not have? Yes it certainly does the multi task window is a huge feature that Apple would probably need to learn to implement into their tablet. The s-pen is huge the Wacom technology is spot on I've been using a Wacom tablet to edit my photos on my computer for several several years and to have this feature on a tablet is awesome.So again to recap the added value that Samsung is pushing on their advertisement that you get this supposedly $600 in extra stuff is a complete scam in my eyes. To me the value is only really $25 for the Google Play Store other than that everything else is a waste.Will I keep this tablet? Definitely it's a great tablet let's see how soon Samsung can get there research and development team together and get it updated, and keep it updated with the latest versions of the Android software and not take 6 or more months from release date and have you still waiting for the update and at the same time call this their top of the line model when its not even running the most current Android software.", "Date": "April 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Beats iPad", "Author": "C.

Intent was to transition my iPad to my wife who is comfortable with her iPhone and me to adopt the Galaxy Note as I really like my Galaxy S3 phone and am looking for maximum compatibility.  I have been exceptionally pleased.  More and more I belive that the Apple products, while they do have some very nice features, just seem to lock you out of too many things.  For example, try transporting your Apple address book somewhere else, good luck with that.  The google address book gives you so much more flexibility and power.The screen on the Galaxy Note is incredible.  The form factor being a little wider is also generally very nice.  Some Aps although do not scale quite as well to this - for example my application to read the San Diego Union Tribune seems to be sized more for the iPad - not a huge deal though.The internet browser on the Galaxy Note seems superior to me.  It just works better and seems to support more websites and particularly video formats that you can not view on the iPad.Love how you can install your own micro SD memory card in the Samsung products.  You can buy a good quality 64Gb microSD for a fraction of what Apple charges you to get 64Gb of memory.EMail Ap provided with the Galaxy Note is very nice and easy to use.GPS Receiver Built In - very nice built-in GPS receiver.  My iPad2 does not have this.  Don't know if the more recent iPads do or not.  Works very well and of course integrates great with hte GoogleMaps and since this is an Android device no problems there.  You do need wireless access for your maps to update as you move around the country but I did find a free Ap that allows you to download maps for free (Navigator) that appears a good option.Dropbox - Samsung gives you 2 years subscription with 50Gb storage to Dropbox.  I am very impressed with the ease of use of Dropbox on the Samsung Galaxy Note as well as my home laptop.  I can even look up files from my work computer network by just logging into my dropbox account.  This is very convenient.In general, I am thrilled with my Galaxy Note 10.1 2014.  It is generally very intuitive and I find it to be more powerful in many ways than the iPad.  Did I mention the ability to open a second application to the side or in a subwindow - very convenient at times.  There are a few drawbacks compared to the Apple iPad which I will list below.  - Ap Support - the application availablity for the Galaxy Note is excellent but not as good as for Apple.  If you have a popula Ap on your Apple device I would estimate an 80% probability the Ap will be available on the Androis as well.  But there have been some supriises.  I have been running an Ap on my iPad and Galaxy S3 Phone to track my NCAA mens basketball bracket and mysteriously it does not seem to be available for the Galaxy Note.  Similarly, my Glo Bible ap is not yet available but they say they are working on it.  Also, can't find an Ap for Amazon Prime  video although there is one to play Amazon prime video on the iPad.  Hopefully Amazon will get one available soon for the Android.  - Music Transferability - this is both a negative and a positive.  If you have all your music in Apple iTunes it will take a little work to transfer into the Android system.  That said, Apple iTunes I find to be too restrictive and I'm trying to move away from them.  There are aps and utilities out there that can do this for you.  - Picture Transferability - Apple does a very nice job with it's iPhoto program and then transfers all of your albums seamlessly to your iPad and/or iPhone.  That said, it appears that Google's Picasa can now import your iPhoto albums.  I will be trying to make that transition but I do have to complement Apple on the ease of use of their iPhoto program between their devices.After one week I am thrilled with the Samsung Galaxy Note and highly recommend it.

I decided I wanted to upgrade and get something I could multi-task with and have good battery life.I read and watched reviews and settled on the Note 2014 32G.

I can easily go a couple of days with a battery charge. I was lucky to get a day on my Tab 10.1 with less use.

The display was the main reason I got this tablet.I compared and contrasted this display with my iPad 3rd generation which has the retina display, as well as compared it to the old note 10.1. One of the problems that I had with the Note 10.1 2012 was that it always had an awful glare especially when I was outside or in a room with a lot of windows or with lot of light. It killed me because the old note was very powerful but the screen always had a very annoying glare. The screen on the old note 10.1 was also not as sensitive to the touch as my iPad 3 did. The speakers on the old note were not as good as the iPad 3 either. But with the new note 10.1 2014, Samsung really nailed everything right on the head. The screen on the new note 10.1 2014 outperforms the note 10.1 2012 by a long shot. The screen is brighter and way more vivid. It is also a lot more sensitive to the touch. Those annoying glares that I always got with the note 10.1 2012 were gone. I also noticed that the speakers were significantly louder than the ipad 3 and the note 10.1 2012, but the ipad had a lot more bass it it's speakers.One problem that I had with the iPad, as a student, was that it was somewhat difficult to take notes while in class. There really aren't any very good word processors made for the iPad. The note 2014 comes with Polaris Office which is really similar to Microsoft Word. It is a fully functioning word processor. What I like most is that through Polaris Office, you can set it up to save all of your documents straight to google drive so that your documents can be synced to all of your devices. For example: I start an essay in class and save it; when I get home, I can continue working on it on my computer; then when I am on the bus I can read it on my Note 3 cell phone. You can make word, excel, and even powerpoint presentations right there on your tablet. I purchased a keyboard case for it and paired with my Razer Orochi bluetooth mouse, it is nearly a computer!While using a bluetooth mouse and a bluetooth keyboard with the wifi and bluetooth on all the time, this tablet lasts me all day and even into the next day for a little if I forget to charge it. And because it is so small and light, it is very easy to carry around all day rather than having to carry a bulky laptop.Another useful feature is the app Watch-on. Because the note 10.1 2014 has an IR sensor in it, you can pretty much control anything that uses an IR remote. I have it set up with my 42\" TV, my bluray player, my cable box, and my receiver. I did find the app somewhat difficult to use sometimes because you can pretty much only use it when your line of sight is directly above the tablet and since you have to line up to IR sensor to your TV when you want to change the channel, sometimes you don't always hit the right buttons.Another thing I use it for a lot is for music. I am involved in the Millennial Choral Organizations in Mesa, AZ which requires that I memorize a lot of music in a relatively short period of time. I just take a picture of the music using one of the Cam Scan apps and save it as a PDF until the end of the semester when I delete it all. Part of having all of this music is having to write notes on how the conductor wants it to sound. One thing I was a little disappointed in was that it does not have the capability of writing notes on the PDF and then saving them. But what I figured out is that you can select free write after you pull out the s-pen and then I can write my notes on it and it saves it as a screenshot. I wish that it had the capabilities to do write on the PDF, but unfortunately, you cant.Overall it is a great and powerful tablet.", "Date": "January 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "A great product that finally stablized in it's update releases.", "Author": "Jeffry J.

HOWEVER, I bought this after all the updates were out, and things were already looking better. You can see the line in the reviews for when this happened. This is customary for new technology. I have had a rooted kindle and have had helped others with an iPad, but I really wanted something that was Android and good enough to use many of the features of my phone on a pad (I have a Samsung S4, near enough to the technology in this product to sway the purchase).Snote is working much better since the update. Most of the other technology is working really good. I have not removed the Knox interface as many have threatened (and some have done). The primary reason is update path. I am still waiting for a good bluetooth keyboard case for this and I want the update path so far. That does not mean I may stick with it forever, but I actually use the Knox interface to split my business/home use. This is very handy. I have packed this pad with goodies and it's still going strong. I use both the Spen and a standard pad stylus from my roocase purchased at the same time. The Spen actually has the detail/resolution to grab the timesheet program interface bar that is buggy on a mobile interface (it gets squashed).The camera has less resolution than my S4, but actually has slightly better light and color response. I have not used the front facing camera and am unlikely to in the near future. I am just not a visual chat person.All in all this pad is stable in the current update mark and operates fast and efficiently for everything that I do.

She will be 2 in January. Since we purchased it she has been kinda ruff with it, and it doesn't look any worse for wear. Granted we take plenty of precautions, but it is not nearly as fragile as a lot of products these days.The whole family uses it but I got it mainly for educational purposes for my daughter, and just the short while she has played with it I am already happy with my purchase. The S pen has fantastic response to her movement when playing games or painting. It is truly amazing to me how much she is able to do on this device at such a young age. The response of the screen with her fingers or pen are spot on and lets her do exactly what it is she wants to do. If she is painting the screen will register all of her fingers when she paints and she loves it. I have had trouble finding time to learn the device because she is always on it.This is the first tablet I have purchased. I have a desktop and a laptop that has taken care of all my needs before, but man have I been missing out. Its like I stepped out of a time machine with this thing. I have spent several hours just playing with all the features, like i'm a kid again( When i can get it away from my daughter). My wife and I are both in school, and this tablet is going to be much more useful there than our laptops were also. Words are crisp and light can be adjusted well so that its a pleasant experience reading. This will save us more than the price of the tablet in the end on the savings for ebooks and textbooks.

I only used it for a few days before deciding to return it. There's a lot of stupid problems here, not all of which are Samsung's fault. But overall, it's a no-deal for me.1) The Simpsons game \"Tapped Out\" ran so slow as to be unusable. The constant stuttering of the screen updates and the slowed-down animation made it obvious that somehow this particular game challenged the quad-core processor in the Note. It's a serious defect, considering a two year old model like the ASUS TF300 could run the game 10 times faster, and THAT unit is sluggish. This might be a specific issue with this game, and could be a software fix from EA. But it's important to consider, as the game it's very popular and widely used.2) The offers are  good deals, but they are limited to the device itself. For example, the free year of GoGo Inflight Internet? That's not something you can add to your existing account or even create a new account for. Instead, everytime you want to use it you must connect to GoGo from this tablet, click on a \"Chat Now\" button and request from a CSR a one-time code for that flight. You'll need to repeat that process everytime you want to use it, and it can't be used on a laptop or other device. Similar limitations exist for many, but not all of the offers. The 3 free audio books? Only 1 per month. All of these offers are really just trial subscriptions with a few exceptions. I *strongly* recommend checking out the details and fine-print here before buying: [...]3) This Note uses Android 4.4 aka \"KitKat\". There is a major change in Android 4.4 that affects how MicroSD card access works. Apps will no longer be able to access the entire card and read or write anywhere they want. Instead, each app will have its own little closed-off area to use, nothing else. This means general-purpose file explorer apps will not be able to see anything on a MicroSD card. Photo viewers will be similarly limited. Backup programs will not be able to backup files from a MicroSD card (though they will be able to backup file TO the MicroSD card). Most significantly, you will NOT be able to move apps to the MiroSD to free-up space in the internal memory. This is all being done by Google, not Samsung, but it still impacts this model.

It stopped working right 3 days after receipt.  I purchased the 3 year warranty, but my experience with these warranties was negative because Best Buy refused to even look at my last tablet the ASUS Transformer 700 when I took it to the store under the same type of warranty.  Best Buy Geek Squad Manager said it was an unidentified software problem,  thus not covered under the warranty.  They even wanted over $60 to set the tablet back to factory original. This requires 2 keystrokes.  One year later and at least 6 hard resets later they finally replaced the ASUS under warranty.  Skip ahead to March 2014.

This was unacceptable. The manager finally transferred us to a very nice woman at Amazon.  It took less than 10 minutes and she had sent a new Samsung device along with return instructions sent to my email.

I have been wanting a tablet wih the capability to draw in real-time, and this tablet does not disappoint.

There is some question out there as to whether or not it does. Mine accepts with no issue a 64gb PNY SDXC micro. No reformatting, no special app, no nothing. not sure if they accept higher than 64gb. if they do, that's even better capability. i'm not a big fan of loading up on apps that get used once a month so keeping 10gb of space available inside with the remainder on the card is more than plenty for the average user. if this isnt enough you might want to rethink what you are storing. do you really listen to 25gb of music. probably not. there are also other wireless storage options out there now that might make for a nice pairing with a tablet if you really need more storage.If you are on the fence about \"useful\" tablets like i have been, this is the tablet to take you off the fence.

To me it operates like my Note 2. I really enjoy my note 2 and the tablet is no different. If you have a Note device and don't Use the Pen, Save yourself some money and get a Tab Tablet. I Use the pen about 80% of the time, so itis natural for me.Over all the operating system is smooth. I find little to no lag when swyping or accessing apps. The tablet has a lot features such as an IR. Most won't use it, but I find it handy to control my tv. Here are a few things that I like the most.1. The Screen resolution is amazing2. Browser works flawlessly. I travel a lot and I have had no wifi issues anywhere I have used the tablet.3. Tablet is smooth and fast4. Pen is very Comfortable and writes smooth with a Zagg HD Screen Protector5. I never run out of RAM and I have not had any issues with the tablet running slow.6. No issues with Bluetooth or WIFI7. With the Micro SD slot, I have lots of Storage.Things I dislike1. Built in video Player skips when watching movies2. Samsung did not include the shortcut features that the Note 2 has3. The auto brightness works great if outside, but when there little to no light the Screen is to dim. I find myself making manual adjustments4. Battery life is not as good as Some tablets this Size. Though with the note 2, using the Pen drains the battery more with use. This could be the same with the tablet.Overall,Ian happy with the tablet. $600 is a bit Steep, but the pen features are what I like the most.

The only thing i didn't like abt this is the fact that it can be quite difficult to edit these files. But it does do it but just a bit slower than a computer.One thing I don't like about the tablet is the fact that the charging port is at the bottom and it is nearly impossible to charge and use it at the same time. The way I bypassed this problem is by taking my tablet out of the case and putting it back in upside down so the charge port is on the top. With screen rotation on, the tablet automatically adjusts. But this is is SUCH a hassle to do it every time I want to charge and use at the same time, which is pretty frequent.

In fact, if I had not been passing it along to my other half when they decided they wanted one, I would have kept that for a good long time. The new 2014 edition is great especially in the screen. It is beautiful. It is as beautiful as the Note 3 screen which I have as well. It is faster than the old Note 10.1. How much so from a noticeability perspective? For my stuff... not dramatically noticeable (to me). If your use cases are different than mine then you will probably notice a huge difference but most of my work on it is not too demanding. It is more about comfort and relaxation for me than a workhorse. Any time I have needed it to come to bat with power, it was not sluggish or cumbersome in any way and I feel like it would meet most if not all workhorse demands that could be thrown at it. There are a lot of improvements beyond the screen. Many aesthetic. The lack of onscreen menu and back buttons is a little tricky to get used to after having them before. It is a trade off, screen real estate used for content vs navigation being right in front of you at all times. A lot of new integrations and application improvements come with it as well. The build is of great quality and It feels very solid. I had a case for my old Note 10.1 and I would say it is required for the 2014 version. I could not imagine using this in any serious manner without a case. It is just too slippery to prop up somewhere, on something etc. To hold it, not very slippy but to lean it against something?

Make sure you get the 2014 version of this tablet.  A minor point: I wish the charger port were in a different location as it interferes with fully using my case in all configurations.  Note-taking with S-Note is amazing; it is very functional and can save your notes to picture or PDF format for mailing to others. See my reviews for the case that I really like for this device.  I wish the \"menu\" and \"back\" capacitive \"buttons\" were closer to the outer edges to make them easier to use with my case, but this is only a minor complaint.  The fact that it (and the Note 3 phone) actually have a \"back\" \"button\" is so helpful, unlike the iPhone/iPad which does not have one.  I have no issue with the size or design/build of the stylus.  32G of internal memory, with the ability to add up to a 64Gb microSD card is far better than how an iPad designs their approach to memory. Also, you can configure the closing of an app when you swith to a different display/functionality which helps battery life.  Otherwise, I end up with a zillion apps running in the background, thus draining my battery.", "Date": "February 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Loving it!!", "Author": "Sonny delos Santos", "ReviewID": "R2WOBRIMGGOS9S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well it is my first tablet so I can't really compare it to any other tablet.

Greer", "ReviewID": "R180MRHC1979U", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this when I'd had enough of the low RAM in my iPad3.  I was running into issues with iOS7 where the iPad would lag with too many apps open and only 3 web browser tabs could be active at any given time without them having to reload when you clicked back over to the tab.The first Galaxy Note was DOA.  Got audio but the screen did not work.  I tried everything and finally had Amazon replace it, which they did quickly.  The second one worked fine.Packaging:The device was packaged well.  Included were the Galaxy Note Tablet, the Pen, AC adapter and USB charging cable and a small users guide package I never opened.Setup:Once I got a working device, setup was easy.  Pretty much the standard Android fair.  Configure it for your wireless, put in your Google account info and you are pretty much good to go.Pros:*  The screen is great.  High resolution, rich colors and good contrast.*  The Samsung skinned version of Android 4.3 has some great features like split window with multiple apps running on the screen simultaneously.*  The Pen and built-in Wacom digitizer are a great combination if you are an artist.*  Games shine with the high end hardware on this device.*  Charges with standard Mini-USB connector.*  Pen could be good for taking notes if you get a good notes app (the Samsung included version is not good)Cons:*  Not a fan of the fake plastic leather backing.*  Samsung heavily skinned Android for this device.  While there are some positives, as mentioned above, there are far more negatives.  The interface can be very laggy when swiping or loading apps.  Double-tapping the home button brings up a Samsung app instead of the list of running apps.  Swiping up brings up a Samsung Magazine app and it is sensitive enough that I accidentally opened it constantly.*  Samsung chose to go with hard buttons, which are fine in landscape.  In portrait, however, the buttons are on the side.  This position is not only inconvenient and unfamiliar, but it also is where you put your fingers to hold it so you often accidentally hit the home button.*  Standby battery life is terrible.  For constant use, the battery compares to the iPad but in standby, you lose 15-20% of battery life over the course of a day.  If you have gotten use to leaving your tablet lying around unplugged, don't plan on it with this device.*  No LED battery charging indicator on the device or adapter.In the end, the cons won out and I sent the device back to Amazon for a refund.  Before sending it back, I purchased the Sony Xperia Tablet Z (http://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-SGP311U1-10-1-Inch-Tablet/dp/B00CE590Z0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1396645920&sr;=8-1&keywords;=sony+tablet+z).  While the specs of this device suggest it will be slower, that is not the case.  Since it is very lightly skinned, the performance is great.  It is also much lighter and thinner than the Galaxy Note and has much better standby battery life (comparable to the iPad).  To top it off, it is cheaper.

I've always been an Android guy, but I decided to give a Retina iPad Mini a try. I found that interesting and not as bad as I expected, but didn't care for the app ecosystem (overall usability was great though). So I exchanged it for this Note 2014 expecting the experience I would be happy with. After all, this is nearly the fastest Android tablet out right now. Before I was able to walk out of the store, a Samsung rep who worked at my Best Buy told me to stop by and have the firmware updated. A bit disappointing to have to let someone else open your new tablet, peel the sticker off, and then sit around and wait for it to update since it's not up to date out of the box.I was underwhelmed by the Note however. Comparing from the retina Mini, power on on the Note has a delay of 2-3 seconds for no reason - the Mini came on instantly, every time. Much like my Galaxy SII, the Note sometimes didn't register my PIN when I tried to unlock it. The screen is good, though the larger screen size used here doesn't make it as impressive as a smaller screened tablet such as the retina Mini (But different form factors I know, not really complaining here). I found myself disappointed with the quality of apps for Android tablets. Many were clearly scaled up from their phone versions and took no advantage of the increase in resolution. The YouTube app is particularly disappointing considering it's Google's own service and yet it is greatly lacking in user experience compared to the free YouTube player I downloaded when trying out the retina Mini MXtube (Which allows the exact resolution to be selected, downloading of videos to be watched later, and a very nice user interface). In fact, the most downloaded apps seemed to just be for emulators to play old video games on these which honestly seems like a waste of power for this tablet.Comparing cameras, somehow the retina Mini had better cameras than the Note 2014. Both the front and rear facing cameras on the note have a high level of noise and the colors go from being too blue to far too red. I find Samsung's photo \"helper\" modes to be largely more trouble than they're worth. Battery life is good, I never got it too low in the time I had it but I left it off the charger for an entire day idling with wifi on and it only lost 5% of its battery charge after 6-7 hours. During active use it seems to lose about 10% every 45 minutes to an hour, so pretty good for a 10\" tablet. The retina Mini did best the battery of this though, only losing maybe 5% in an hour of regular use. Both would last you through an entire day. Something annoying about the Note 2014 - it can't charge from a USB via a computer. You must plug it into an AC outlet with the adapter to charge it, which is very annoying to me as I use my Galaxy SII with my computer's USB port for charging and the retina Mini also did so without fuss.The big attraction for me was the ability to use multiple apps at once and to have a stylus. Disappointingly however, you can't just put whatever app you want in a window, only some apps are allowed to be put in a window. I use Dolphin browser for internet on Android and I am not able to use that in the window. In fact, the majority of my apps cannot be used with this feature which is a huge letdown. Unless you like running all the vanilla stock apps, the pen window feature won't be of much use to you. While I'm thinking of it, I wanted to use this also for remote desktop use occasionally - since I have a 2560x1600 monitor I figured it would be a perfect match. Unfortunately it scales the resolution down somehow, which seems disingenuous. I have many icons on my desktop, and the retina Mini only seemed to shift the location of two icons - remote desktoping from the Note 2014 shifted three rows worth of icons all over my screen (forcing me to redo my haphazard organization scheme). Very disappointed the remote desktop didn't do better (I used Microsoft RDP with a Win 7 machine).As far as taking notes, it's quite nice. You can choose multiple tip types and widths, and you can zoom in, select your text, resize and relocate it, and even convert math to formulas (Very hit or miss though, you have to print very neatly for it to work - my notes were never nice enough to use this feature when taking notes as I normally would. S note does a decent job ignoring your palm on the screen, however it sometimes does register while writing and will: zoom out, try to go to another page or treat it as a three finger tap (hides the toolbox - what a hassle figuring out how to get it back after I kept inadvertently hiding it). S note is not a very user friendly app, as it's difficult to figure out how to create a new memo in portrait/landscape mode (You can't change it after you've created it, you have to open S note and then create a new one from the template - and it doesn't reorient if you go from landscape to portrait or vice versa).I also discovered S note is very laggy at times, and I can't understand this on a tablet as powerful as the Note 2014. I had only two background apps on at the same time (Draw Something and my Lookout device protection) and I'd sometimes write and then see nothing. Thinking I missed the screen, I'd try again and nothing. Then it would finally write, so I'd try to keep going and then it was still lagging. It did this several times, which is very frustrating when you need to take down notes quickly. At one point I tried to create a new memo book so as to change the format, but didn't like it so I hit back and then hit delete - but it had selected the memo I just took all my notes in. It deleted it so fast I had no time to react, and there was no copy to be found on the device. Thankfully Evernote captured it in its trash section, I've seen horror stories of the Samsung backup not having the notes due to problems with their service syncing properly. Later I was taking notes and noticed it was lagging badly again, so this time I thought to clear my memory. I had just saved my notes and synced, but when I came back all I had was an empty memo. I checked and it apparently did not sync with Evernote, and didn't save the notes. When I cleared the memory it was actually using 1.89 GB of the 3 GB available, which I found shocking considering how little I had running on it - I've nearly run out of memory many times on my Galaxy SII with only 1 GB and I'm sparse on background apps because of this. I honestly can't believe Android can manage to use up that much memory, and I had no live wallpapers and only the weather and S note widgets running on my home screens. A quick note, I tried a few games and found some did ok but there were more than a few which had noticeable framerate drops. I know this isn't supposed to be a gaming tablet, but it's surprising that it has trouble with some of these titles considering the generally powerful hardware it has.That was the final straw that made me decide to return it. There was a lot of potential for this to be great, but it ends up being hampered by TouchWiz which is a clunky interface that bogs the device down and lots of unnecessary Samsung software which is honestly not very good. Some of my qualms are honestly with Android on tablets. The experience is not as smooth or full featured as it should be. So much of what you'll find is just a phone app running on your big tablet, which makes the screen feel like a waste. I also found wifi performance disappointing. Sitting at my campus with 3 out of 4 wifi \"bars\" I was having trouble connecting to the internet. I pulled my Galaxy SII out and got online with the same 3 out of 4 \"bars\" immediately. I toggled wifi off and back on and it seemed to straighten up, but hardly confidence inspiring performance from a device which should easily destroy the performance of my much older Galaxy SII.For the price you pay, this is not a good deal at all. If it were cheaper, perhaps it would be worth dealing with the quirks but this is being sold as a premium product yet suffers from limited software and disappointing performance. I still do not care for the iOS app ecosystem so I won't be getting an iPad again. After this, I am moving on to a Windows tablet - far less limitations with the OS available on the device (Even with RT). If Windows tablets don't pan out for me, I think I'll just go back to using a laptop - something like a Lenovo X230t which has the ability to be a laptop or a tablet (albeit a big one) offers far more capability and functionality without issues than iOS or Android. Both of those platforms seem excellent on phones, but I personally question their value on tablets. Personally, this is the last Samsung product I will be buying as my Galaxy SII has experienced regular lag, hang ups, and random issues for no reason and it is only a few months old (My original was replaced due to the microphone dying on it for no particular reason). I am disappointed in Samsung's failure to improve their quality, while many competitors are stepping up it seems Samsung is just beefing up the internals and reusing the cheap enclosures with the old TouchWiz interface which needs to be ditched.", "Date": "February 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "It's an awesome tablet", "Author": "Chromie", "ReviewID": "RX15I1ORPDW9X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This tablet is better than I expected.

I have been waiting for my first impression to wear off before I wrote this review, and it has. The reason I bought this tablet is that I was contemplating getting a laptop, for school, despite how much I dislike laptops.I bought this tablet knowing that it had the stylus (pen) and it had handwriting recognition. All store models I had used were all very fast and responsive. My handwriting is unlike anyone else's that I have seen. In the years past, devices with handwriting recognition were not able to read my writing. They required I write in a specific manner.  Also previous devices required that I write one letter or word at a time. All the store models of the Samsung Galaxy were able to read my handwriting. The Samsung Galaxy allows me to write more than a sentence at one time. It also reads it and processes it quickly, as well as gets better at recognizing my writing the more I use it.With the apps, the web capabilities, the speed, the responsiveness, the handwriting recognition, this tablet has become my school workhouse. I really do not feel I need a laptop anymore. Like anything, the Samsung Galaxy has it's shortcomings, and there are a few. But at the moment, the only shortcoming worth mentioning is the ram. Even with 3gb of ram, and the responsiveness, I feel that it needs more memory. I constantly see my memory usage at 2.74gb. I constantly make sure that I close apps instead of just minimizing them, because i'm always maxing out the memory.And just the OS alone seems to take up 1.23gb of the 3gb of ram, because at boot up, the memory usage is never less. No matter how many apps I close, or memory I clear I cannot remember it ever showing less in memory in use.I am not an apple fan although I have used their devices many times.

I think I'll do a little test by fully charging both then playing the same movie on both with brightness set to half and I'll post the results for those who are interested.(2) I've also noticed a very little light-bleed particularly at the bottom of the screen while watching a movie with the black band at top and bottom, this is in no way a deal breaker as you will hardly ever notice this.UPDATE 18/12/2013:After going a little deeper with my comparison between my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (16GB, White) and Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition (32GB, White), I've come to a few conclusions.Test 1:I streamed the movie \"Olympus Has Fallen\" from Netflix with both tablets playing at the same time \"in sync\", I started with both tablets at 100% battery charge, 50% brightness and 50% volume level and at the end of the movie credits, the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (16GB, White) was at 64% battery life while the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition (32GB, White) was at 57% battery life, a 7% difference. By the way, when looking at the same picture, movie etc. on both tablets side by side, the older tablet has a noticeably bluish hue as opposed to the newer model which shows more vibrant natural colors.Test 2:I continued using both tablets until they reached the 50% battery level then I started the charging process while timing on a stopwatch. The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (16GB, White) took 2:40 to charge from 50%, while the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition (32GB, White) took 3:13 to charge from 50%, a 33 minute difference.All in all I love this tablet, the resolution of this screen is something to behold, everything looks so much better and words are much clearer and I'm really impressed with the sound quality and processor speed. I'm happy that I made the purchase, can't wait to see what Samsung comes up with next in the Note 10.1 line, hope this helps a little.Pros: Realistic color, screen is bright and beautiful, great sounding speakers, can print with my hp printer via wifi.Cons: little light bleed around edges but nothing to talk about.", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great tablet except", "Author": "Mic Will \"H2OSkier\"", "ReviewID": "R1JN7P55XIZJ9H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "1 For the lack of foresight in note taking and saving, organizing, finding notes..

In fact, there were only two reasons I bought a new tablet:  1) I have a strong need to use a tablet for hand written notes and  2) the Transformer Prime camera had failed on me for the third time in the two years I had owned it (it apparently was a major design flaw on that tablet).  I loved the dockable keyboard, speed and everything else about the Transformer otherwise.Still, when I unboxed the note, I was immediately impressed with its speed, beautiful screen, and form factor.  I do find myself missing things like the HDMI port, but was able to easily remedy the keyboard situation by getting an inexpensive case with built-in bluetooth keyboard.  The Note responds well and quickly, even when running multiple applications.  The handwriting experience has been excellent, especially once I purchased the larger stylus (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009PJN1U8/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1)  Battery life is nothing stellar but is acceptable.  Another thing I miss about the Prime is the extended battery life from the keyboard.The only two significant 'gripes' I have about the Note are:1) The built-in Samsung apps.  They get in the way.2) The placement of the Menu/Home/Back buttons.  Rather than being left to be displayed by the OS (appropriately placed based on the tablet orientation), they are part of the perimeter of the tablet.  I don't know whether Samsung didn't really think this through or just assumed/hoped that people would use the tablet in landscape orientation 99% of the time.  Perhaps because of the screen size they didn't want any of it taken up.  Regardless of their reasoning, I disagree with it.

Putting this review out there for people like me who are looking for a tablet that will allow you two write on the screen and convert it to text into a document. While the S Pen can be used to hand write text on the screen in a few ways, for a writer, there isn't an easy way to use this feature. You can use the S Pen in their included Notes app but all handwritten text must be selected and then converted to text - not ideal. This app also requires pages to be the size of the screen which means if you keep writing you'll need to add a new page - no text flow to additional pages. This set up seems designed for the note taker, not a writer.I was not able to get the S Pen to even allow for handwritten entries into Google Drive documents or any other proper document app.The S Pen can be used to hand write and auto convert to text within GMail - but that is hardly useful to a writer of an article or book.Ultimately I had to return the tablet as it did not meet my main need. There was also a bit of a lag on functions - as an example if you have two windows browser tabs open, go to the 2nd and then go back to the first - that page would need to reload. Haven't seen that happen on other tablets and not even on my Samsung Galaxy phone.Pros: The screen does look great. Touch response is excellent. The S Pen used as a cursor worked perfectly.Cons: S Pen support limited within Apps. Handwritten to Text feature not good for writers of large documents (prob. ideal for note takers).

I have two Alienwares, an all-in-one Gateway touchscreen desktop, a Kindle (Paperwhite edition), and a Galaxy Note 3 smartphone. On top of these, I have a powerful desktop which I built myself with top-of-the-line pieces of hardware. Why should I buy a tablet? That's the question I asked myself over and over before I bought the new Galaxy Note 10.1 (2014 edition) with LTE.I told myself that after buying the tablet, it would be my chief e-reader and I'd have to give away my Kindle. I thought it would make for a great browsing device while lying down in bed. Well, I was wrong. My new tablet CANNOT replace my Kindle. The reading experience with my Kindle is much more better. The Kindle Paperwhite is superb; it feels much like a book and offers more than any physical book can. Holding the Kindle is more comfortable compared to by new tablet. There is no way the table can replace my Kindle.As far as browsing the internet goes, I really do not know where this tablet fits. It's neither as small and easy to hold as my smartphone, nor is it as sophisticated as mt M11x laptop. It cannot render web pages as good as my laptop can; it does not run smoothly as my laptop either. Plus, you really would need a kickstand of some sort if you are going to be viewing an hour-long movie on it; not so with my laptop. For those, who thing this tablet, or any tablet for that matter, for that matter will be great for note-taking in classrooms and board meetings, I'd say good luck to you. You can draw with this tablet, scribble short notes, create scrapbooks, and do some other little things like that. But as far as serious note-taking is concerned, no note-taking on a tablet can compare to writing with a pen on an actual piece of paper. Period!To be fair, the tablet is gorgeous as far as tablet goes and has some impressive specs, but I still do not know what task to assign to this device. What sort of task will be best done on a tablet? That's the answer I am yet to find.Some people have complained of occasional lag and stutter with this tablet. I have noticed it too. It makes my wonder what good the 3GB of RAM does. Why would Samsung tot optimize it's Touchwiz to prevent this sort of thing?With all that said, and this is why I rated the tablet with 4 stars, this appears to be the best Android tablet in the market today.

There were always \"Network Connection Issues\".  The network would connect for a second, then the connection would drop.  The messages on the Tablet displayed the message, no connection, reconnect.  I called Verizon and Samsung, and we went through the motions, I replaced the Verizon Router with the latest updated firmware, still same issue network connection problems.  I spoke with Samsung, they made me do a couple of factory resets and I had to re-install all my apps, one by one.  After I did the Factory Reset, same issue, Network Connection Problems.  I am returning the Tablet to Best Buy.  I will try to get a replacement to see if this was an issued with the tablet.

I love the hardware on this device, if it weren't for 3GB Ram, the beautiful screen, and the S-Pen this would have gone back immediately. I stuck with it because I wanted to love this product.When you get this product it is SLOW and CHUGGY. I couldn't believe how poor the experience was! Maybe I am the only one who has experienced this as a search online turned up very few results. The other thing I noticed was the device is filled with bloatware- I don't need the New York Times or Travel Helper or whatever it's called. Words can convey how much stuff is packed on this tablet! I wouldn't care if the experience using the device wasn't so poor (because of being slow).Last night I had enough and installed a new launcher; I didn't even know this was an option! I installed Nova Launcher and wow- what a difference! It's snappy and extremely responsive now. If you get this tablet you absolutely have to change the Launcher because if you don't the experience suffers. When installing a third party launcher you can still use the S-Pen and S-Note apps. I don't know why you wouldn't want to switch at this point.Pro's:+ The hardware, I love how this feels in my hands. Just comfortable.+ The stylus and associated apps are very well integrated.+ Rooting is simple if that is your thing (I wouldn't know).+ Love the IR feature. No more pesky remote.+ Even Apple snobs take notice of this device.Con's:- Be prepared to do some work to get this thing working well (see notes above).- No NFC, so no touch to share with my Note 2.- Front camera isn't as good as it should be. Tablet designers should know that one of the basic use-cases for this device is video communication, what's the point in having an 8 MP rear camera and a 2 MP front camera? Seems like this should be reversed (who is taking pictures with this thing?).In conclusion, glad I kept this device. Despite all of my badmouthing I love it- just want Samsung to pick up the pace on the software side.EDIT: Sluggishness and choppiness seem to keep occurring. At times when tilting from horizontal to vertical the device will hang. Google Maps causes the screen to go black. The WatchOn app text is sometimes garbled. I want to also point out that Samsung is now pushing KNOX onto its products, which is a bad thing. Research KNOX before buying this device to hear what users have to say about it. I wish I could disable this program!With everything stripped down as much as I can (no animations, no frills, etc.) the device is \"just usable\". I have to work very hard to use this tablet. I have to restart the device periodically in order to get it to speed up. So the final verdict on this is \"stay away, far far away\".

Pseudo-power users will not be happy with the device until they clear the standard OS and install a custom ROM.  Real power users would do that first thing anyway, and will then be able to enjoy the full power of the device.  Wherever you get it from, the crappy OS and bloatware will slow down (i.e., cripple) the device to the point of causing noticeable-to-severe lag.  That's absurd considering how unsophisticated and unpleasant the standard UI is.  Still, once you root it, the pen is a great capability lacking in other tablets which makes this one uniquely useful.  The size, weight, resolution, etc. are all good too.  The location of ports and buttons is annoying, and it does some weird things that apparently don't have disable options (e.g. the damn thing buzzes whenever you take the pen out or put it in, even when that notification is turned off...no manual rotation control...etc.).  My suggestion would be to lower your expectations a lot before you get it, then you will be less disappointed.

I like it better than my previous nexus 7 because of its capability and potential in productivity. If you want productivity (with a stylus too) this is a great option to consider... I love to draw and I like the feel of a pen or a pencil. That's something I wish the nexus had. Taking notes on Evernote is fantastic. Drawing on Sketchbook can also be equally satisfying. The stylus gave me that freedom I wanted as a creative type. The accuracy of the pen is what I was looking for! For me, all that the stylus had to offer and could do had me sold. The tablet is great in that manner.I was also drawn to the Play Store. I'm already invested in the Google play store so my purchased apps could easily sync. I don't want to buy the same apps twice and I don't have to. But one thing grieves me.The Bad:At times it tries to do too much. Samsung seems to want to take the helm with your experience and data. It has apps for everything with the intention of completing the experience. You just need to agree to it. But, I already have Google watching. I don't want another. The consequence? I don't think it responded well to foreign apps (like nova) or apps that I think challenge Samsung's intricate OS... So, at times it feels a bit pushy to my app preference. But, I have a Nexus 5 & had a Nexus 7 before this guy. That might explain my craving for a more relaxed experience.The thing is, I didn't expect to be pulled into so many things Samsung. That's what it is. It is a step into the Samsung experience, or a dive. Samsung has it's own app ecosystem waiting for you. That can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on you. I already have my Google app ecosystem and I didn't want to jump into another. So my denying Samsung's didn't make it the cleanest experience. Samsung is expecting you to use its apps and its store. They just want you to agree with what they believe is best. If you're up for that then more power to you! Go for it. It's effort to make things simple is there but it's persistence can be messy. There are quite a few agreements to make for app permissions (which bugged me) for apps I could care less about. The good thing is that there's always an explanation to what's going on along with a choice...And My Magazine... I don't know what Samsung was thinking with that.

I found this to be the same even with this newer version. The bottom was very clicky especially near the s pen area. I loved how sharp and crisp the screen was when watching videos, viewing pictures, reading text and playing games. The speakers also sounded great and were placed nicely so that they could be enjoyed in landscape mode like they should be. When using the tablet in portrait mode i found it very easy to press the menu and back capacitive buttons. Also the placement of the home button was very awkward in this position. I prefer my ipad air in portrait mode since it is 4:3 ratio and is ideal for reading. On the other hand I really prefer the 16:9 ratio on the samsung for watching videos. The android platform is lacks the number of tablet apps the apple eco system has to offer. Im sure in another year or so google would have improved on this part. The iPad air is also much lighter and I got much better battery life. I love that the note tablet offers expandable storage, widgets, third party keyboards and being able to run 2 or more apps at once. Overall I found the samsung note 10.1 2014 to be buggy and not as fast as I expected it to be with its specs. I even installed nova launcher and disabled many apps like I have done on my samsung galaxy s4. Other things I didnt like include: the tablet seemed to get very warm at times even with light usage and no way to disable the magazine feature. Priced at $600 this tablet is bit steep in my opinion. Something closer to $500-$550 would have been ideal. Lastly I was hoping to use the remote app with the ir blaster for my entertainment system like I do with my samsung s4 but the app was really buggy and was not working right. Maybe this will be solved with an update in the future. Overall some really great ideas and hardware. I still prefer my iPad air for now. I hope one day I can switch to an android tablet when more apps become available and the quality improves.

The buttons, ports, cameras, pen holder, speakers, etc are well laid out.Neutral:+ Handwriting recognition is OK.

But aside from the improved screen, it does not feel that way in actual use.In actual use, there are a number of areas in which the machine is somewhat laggy (never horribly so).  Page swipes are one example (whether moving from page to page in a magazine viewed in the Zinio app or page to page on NY Times web pages.)  The lag seems to manifest itself in unresponsiveness (e.g. I swiped on the screen but the machine did not respond.)  However, once on a page, scrolling up or down is fast.I used the pen feature on the \"old\" version of the Note 10.1 to take handwritten notices and really liked the way that machine worked.  Accurate, quick ( keeping up with my writing was not a problem on the old machine) and it ignored my palm resting on the screen as I wrote.Despite the improved specs on the 2014 edition, the S Note app just does not operate as smoothly.  My palm resting on the screen was not ignored as well as on the old version.I did compare the machine against my iPad2.  Overall, the Samsung is a faster tablet at doing some things but is nowhere near as smooth or polished as the Apple system (including the apps.)  The iPad rarely ignores swipes in apps such as Zinio but the Samsung does.  (I cannot tell whether this is a defect in the Samsung interface (TouchWiz) or Android or the Zinio app.)My hope is that through software upgrades the potential of all of this hardware will turn be realized and the functionality of the old Note 10.1 means it is realistic to expect Samsung to do the same thing here.My intended uses for the machine (aside from note taking) are basically content consumption (magazine, books and movies).UPDATED (11.1.13)I decided to return the item and will buy a refurbished version of the old model (the 2012 version of the Note 10.1).  The stylus remains a significant and worthwhile differentiator over the iPads so there are some uses of tablets that work better for me on the Samsung as opposed to the iPad.  However, the iPad universe of quality apps (particularly ones that have desktop equivalents on the Mac) is richer than the offerings on the Android platform so that platform remains my first choice for consumption focused tablets.I will reiterate that throughout the period of ownership of the 2014 tablet, the iPad2 did work better on a number of apps that I use frequently (such as Zinio).", "Date": "October 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Be forewarned Samsung states that there is no compatible keyboard", "Author": "Grateful Dave", "ReviewID": "R3FZAJAEY7PMLB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "To be honest, I haven't gotten my tablet yet and will update this review later, but after reviewing all the reviews on keyboards here and at Best Buy, Newegg, and several android forums, the Bluetooth problem is pretty extensive.

The home button is an actual, physical button you have to push, while the back and widget buttons are digitized.  The problem is that it is virtually impossible to hold the tablet in landscape mode without constantly bumping those buttons.  There is literally no frame around the screen that you can hold without interfering with the operation of the tablet.  In the two days I tried it out, I lost the page I was on, or the app I was in because I could not find a \"safe\" way to hold the tablet...it was maddening!", "Date": "March 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love it!!!!", "Author": "Warren D.

I'll start off with the cons, because most people already know what pros this tablet offers, manufacturers don't advertise their cons.I really wanted to like this tablet, in fact I'm probably going to come back in a few months to see if they flattened out the manufacturer issues. For now, it's unacceptable.|||SUMMARY|||Build quality: 1/5Aesthetics: 4/5Features: 3/5Value: 2/5Reliability: 2/5Overall: 2.4/5_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________|||CONS|||-Horrible quality control on Samsung's part. While I mildly welcome the newly redesigned look of the tablet, with the faux leather back, there are many flaws with the casing. The metal speaker grills on the sides of the tablet are loose, if you tap on them, they will rattle and move. I don't think they'll fall off, but it probably would've been a better idea to have the grills cut out from the casing itself. If you apply pressure to the left hand bezel when holding the tablet in horizontal mode, the plastic creaks and depresses slightly, which is cause for concern. In some models, there are scratches and mis-molded plastic on the faux leather back of the tablet. You're probably thinking I just got an unlucky product, but I've actually bought and carefully inspected five Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition tablets. Yes, FIVE, that's how much I wanted to like this tablet. I would dismiss these issues if the tablet were low end, but this tablet is one of the most expensive android tablets on the market currently, and there is absolutely no excuse for such an atrocious level of quality control. It is standard protocol to check a few samples out of every manufacture batch, five minutes with this tablet and it is obvious the manufacturing process should be better tuned. This tablet actually costs $50 more than the iPad Air, which is often considered \"overpriced\", yet the iPad Air has impeccable build quality and Apple nearly always does a perfect job at quality control. If Samsung wants to charge the same prices as Apple, they need to step up the quality control. The Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition is better than the iPad Air in almost every aspect, and it pains me to see such manufacturer defects.-Cheap materials. This is a $550 tablet folks, it should not be made out of plastic. I would much appreciate if Samsung had replaced the faux-chrome accents and replaced it with brushed aluminum, it would complement the faux leather back so much better. To be honest, I'd be happier if they ditched plastic altogether and had an all aluminum build, give it a nice sleek look.-There is a noticeable graphics lag present when flipping through the homescreens, especially if you have a lot of widgets. Not that bad of an issue, this is easily remedied with Nova Launcher.-The S Note app is very laggy and buggy, I attribute that to the software aspect of the app, and not the hardware in the tablet. The S Note app is the main app I use and it's kind of disappointing to see such low-quality coding and software optimization. Sometimes when starting up the S Note app, it doesn't recognize the pen, or it would just crash, which is very embarrassing when in the middle of an important meeting. I'd also like to mention that the Exynos processor in the tablet isn't actually an octacore processor, but two quad core processors. One running at 1.9GHz and the other running at 1.3GHz for power conservation purposes. I suspect the tablet often hiccups when the two processors hand off processes to each other.-Another bone I have to pick with the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition is that there is no microusb 3.0, which the galaxy note 3 has. They came out at around the same time, and to be honest, the tablet needs microusb 3.0 much more than the phone does. This tablet has a huge battery and it would be nice to charge faster.|||PROS|||-The sound quality on the built in speakers are phenomenal, they are very loud and the sound is clear. Perfect for watching movies or YouTube videos, or listening to music.-I'd also like to note that having an active digitizer is great, in fact, I don't buy tablets that don't have an active digitizer because I tend to take a lot of notes. The Galaxy Note 10.1 is one of the few android tablets that have an active digitizer and I love it.-The battery life is decent, I can get a full days use and maybe more if I don't put it through heavy use.-The screen is great, the resolution is nice and the quality of the screen is probably better than a retina iPad.-Having dedicated navigation buttons means that there's more screen real estate to be used for media and writing notes.-The reading mode of the tablet adjusts the contrast when reading books or articles so it's easier on your eyes.", "Date": "November 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Device is Good, but Warranty Service is Horrible", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R32A1HJT9OEFID", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The device was working great for a while; really loved the weight, the feel, and the S Pen.However, after 5 months of using it for about 2-3 hrs each day, with maybe an hour or so worth of writing with the S-Pen, the tip broke off.

The description stated that there was a 1/4\" by 1/4\" \"cosmetic\" flaw on the front of the device. The description also mentioned that there was no original packaging or user manual. For these reasons alone, the description stated that it was selling the device for approx a 25% discount. There was no mention of any issues with functionality. When I received the tablet, I inspected it to identify where the cosmetic flaw was on the front of the device but could not find it. When I began to use the tablet, I began to notice that the functionality was severely compromised in a variety of ways.Text, buttons and other functional elements were frozen or missing from virtually every application. For example, it was impossible to browse the internet from any browser, it was constantly freezing or rapidly refreshing and chunks of the page would black out. Text would disappear from buttons or windows making it impossible to read and click/tap as needed. In some cases, the functional elements would go missing altogether. This happened whether in a browser or any application I launched. It even happened in the settings menu! The display also began to erode very quickly. Within just one day of use, or trying to use the tablet, white lines began to appear even when resting on the home screen.I understand that I received the item for a 25% discount, but I still paid close to $400 and would expect that the device would be somewhat functional. Given that the seller was Amazon itself, I trusted that the description was accurate. When I called to see what could be done, they offered an apology, a return but no replacement.

I have to say that for what I payed for this device I was hoping for something with a little more...something.Let me start by saying I am an self professed geek,  and I have owned many android devices: but never a Samsung before and probably never again. I returned my Surface 2 since the app selection with Microsoft was less than sufficient, and got this 2014 edition. I was greeted by the abhorrent TouchWiz launcher, that was immediately replaced, and this system lag that ruled over almost every application including exiting apps and returning to the home screen. The \"cool\" features like multitasking and the S Pen are vastly overrated and/or are not actually usefull due to limitations. Overall the whole UE this tablet provides feels incomplete and sluggish and will not give you with the smooth operation of a new iPad Air or even my old Surface 2. Inside, 3gb of ram which is above industry standard  is still somehow not enough, coupled with the quad core Exynos i was expecting more bang....but this beast has been tamed by software.Then there is the subject of the materials, I won't go into great detail since there are many reviewers hating on the plastic that samsung uses instead of alum, and then there's the 'faux leather' texture on the back *insert eyeroll*. Suffice to say it is seriously lacking in refinement. There are audible creaks and cracks when handling the device, the added weight of using alum would have been welcomed.However, I am able to surf the web, read emails, and watch Netflix on its beautiful display.

In case someone reads those comments considers taking them seriously, a few points:1) Yes, I'm reviewing the 2014 model. Please note \"Amazon verified purchase\" under my name.2) Yes, the relative lack of useability of the pen pushes this to a 2-star rating, which according to Amazon means \"I don't like it\". 3 stars means \"I like it\". Considering the one feature that sets this tablet apart and makes it one of (or the) most expensive Android tablet, is a design failure large enough to cause me to return it, I think I can say I DON'T LIKE IT.3)Of course turning the tablet upside down solves the problem of your palm accidentally hitting the home button. And if you use the device without a case and write with the device resting flat on a table or in your lap, you are good to go. However, I (like most people I would think) use it with a case. That is the only easy way to get the device resting on a flat surface at a 25 degree (or whatever) angle that makes it comfortable for writing. Have you seen the cases that can fold back at that angle? They all have cutouts for the different buttons (volume, power, s-pen, etc.) that only allow you to insert the device into the case one way, which is NOT upside down. So, you cannot use the upside down method if you are using a case.3-a)Even if a solution to the problem listed above (accidental home-button-pushing) is somehow found, it still doesn't solve the problem of that little ruler thing that runs along the bottom of the handwriting keyboard now.4)My problems weren't because I was using S-Note, because I don't use S-note. I was trying to write notes in Evernote. The app being used doesn't matter because it is the SAME handwriting keyboard that comes up for all apps. Really, what a nitwit comment.Yeesh, some the people ripping me a new one for my review don't even know what they are talking about. All I can say to someone reading this review and weighing whether or not buy the Note 10.1 is to go try it if you can somewhere - especially if you are buying it for the hand-writing capabilities with the s-pen.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I purchased the Galaxy Note 8 about 4 months ago and liked it a lot, but quickly realized it was too small. I used it to write take notes in Evernote for all of my meetings and it worked great for that. Connectivity with projectors was a problem, and the screen was too small to use remote desktop to get into my work server when I traveled. So when I heard about the Note 10.1 2014 coming out I planned to upgrade and pass the Note 8 on to one of my staff.Got the Note 10.1 a few days ago and it was like Christmas morning. Went through the standard setup where it downloaded not 1 but 2 updates to the Android operating system, downloaded all of my apps and got it set up just like my Note 8. Of course I wanted to play with it, so I opened up Evernote and started writing a fake note. I immediately realized there was a problem because the physical home button is in the middle of the tablet when you have it landscape mode, which is how I (and most users) would use it propped up at a slight angle (in its case) on a desk/table while in meetings. That home button ends up under your fist as you hand write your text across the screen, and about once every 3-5 times my hand touched the home screen I put enough pressure on the button to cause the Note to exit out of my program and go the home screen.Problem #2 is with the actual hand writing keyboard mode. It is different than the one that comes on the Note 8. It still looks like yellow note paper, but there is a weird little ruler running along the bottom. What happens on the Note 10.1 is that when you write, your hand writing moves to the left and eventually off the screen. You can touch that little ruler along the bottom and drag it to the right side of the screen to bring back previous text you wrote, I assume to be able to change it or something. The problem is that my hand would also catch that ruler and drag the text back towards the middle occasionally, which would cause whatever I am writing at that second to be over-written on a previous word, creating a mess with the text that actually ends up on the screen. It would also occasionally have a word jump over to the right side of the screen (I couldn't figure out why that was happening) and so what I was writing would get out of order.This is very difficult to explain so I'm sorry if I didn't do a good job. I tried recording a video of this but couldn't get my camera set up at a good angle. I suggest if you are considering buying this you call some local stores to see if any have them on display so you can try it. If you are like me and buying this tablet for the pen functionality then you really should try it.Oddly I didn't experience any of the lag that many of the professional reviewers (Engadget, Tech Radar, etc.) have complained about. Great looking and feeling device, and it was very responsive. But it is almost like they didn't do extensive user testing on this when they moved the home button and designed this new handwriting keyboard software. Very strange and disappointing.As an Android user since the first Droid phone came out (currently have a Galaxy S3 phone and still love it) this has been a real kick in the crotch. Since I have seen the benefit of having such a device with me at all times at work, and the benefit of being able to write naturally with a pen, it looks like I am going to have to go to a..a...oh this hurts, a Windows tablet.

Now they have a 15 day period in which you can get a full refund or exchange if any problems occur. Exactly 1 day after that warranty expired, I started having multiple glitches on my tablet! It turned off abruptly several times while watching videos, playing games, surfing through the net, it wouldn't charge while I was using it, and the icing on the cake was that by the end of the month, for the last 2 days it failed to charge. I finally decided to take it back to the store to see if I could get a full refund or exchange, because after all its still new, only 1 month old, and with minimal use. I'm not one of those people who's glued to my tablet, cell phone, etc, so my world didn't come crashing down, but its still a huge inconvenience. Their rep, which btw was very courteous, tested it, and nothing happened, the tablet was dead. So, anyway, to make a long story short (too late), all Best Buy could do was send it to Geek Squad to have it fixed! I'll get it it back in approx. 2 weeks from today!! YAY!!I sure do hope either a Samsung Rep or Best Buy Manager read this post. I'm just dismayed at the faulty product I purchased from Samsung. It's still new, and its basically just a lemon. I can't believe that after just one month, my tablet had to be sent back for repairs. I'm just utterly amazed at the poor quality of certain products nowadays. Sadly, I've lost confidence in Samsung.So if you plan on purchasing this faulty product, take my comment into account.If you have any recommendations for myself or any other persons who've had this problem, please feel free to message me.My next step is to send a well written letter to Samsung.Oh well, as I like to say, when life throws you lemons, make some hard lemonade!I'll update whenever I get it back.Update!!OK so I finally got my tablet back............ 3 weeks later......Internal battery was changed, I apologize, I'm not a techie, but yes there were some hardware problems with the device, Geek squad took care of it. Best Buy rep admitted they've had several people come in with similar problems, though their tablets being much older. Got it home........would not charge, tested the USB cable on several outlets, and.......... nothing.Went back to Best Buy, purchased another cable, worked fine. So, Samsung, please include working cables with your products.......please?Been using it for about a couple of weeks since then, guess what? It still abruptly turns off, and it still does NOT charge while I'm using it...... ::sigh::But.......it's working.........most of the time.

When using the pen and scrapbook, sometimes when you draw around a part of page, it trysto save it before you've even completed the circle. Also note, the WIFI version is using two  quad core processors, which I've read have trouble communicatingwith each other.  I was told by someone at best buy that it used the new Snapdragon 800, which on the WIFI it doesn't. As a matter of fact its using the SamsungExynos chip, which is only 1.9 quad core.  The LTE version will come with a snapdragon 800 chip and run at 2.3 gigs quad core. Im sure the Snapdragon will hopefullybe fixed by the time it comes out. Rumor has it Samsung will release an update for the system to use all 8 cores, but at this point who knows when.

I can see the pixels. I was lying in bed with the tablet with my face quite close to the screen and I noticed how the icons at the bottom and the charging level indicator were not smooth. So I got out the iPad 4 and compared side by side. I cannot see the pixels on the retina iPad screen but I CAN with this. It is still a lot better compared to previous tablets or phones but cannot match the iPad's screen. Because the PPI is similar, I am assuming this has to do with the type of screen but maybe someone can elaborate?2. No touch gestures. It is frustrating to go from the iPad's intuitive gestures to absolutely no gestures. Having to take my fingers off the screen to touch a button to go back to the home screen or switch between apps is annoying. I believe iPad has copyrights on its gestures but surely they can come up with some unique gestures. I know some launchers have gestures but perhaps someone can tell me if they are as good of experience as the iPad.These two things are annoying. But there are some things I do like about the Note:1. I like the plastic backing. I prefer the plastic build vs the metal one of the iPad. The iPad metal enclosure feels cold and I don't like that. It also feels lighter.2. It is good for going paperless. It has a SD card reader and I like the fact there is a file system that you can access so you can organize your files in folders easily.3. I prefer the Android OS for a number of reasons.Overall, it is a good tablet. If this tablet were $100 cheaper, I'd give it 4 stars.Edit: Also, this is my first experience with the S-Pen but I feel it is a bit laggy. I write pretty quickly and this couldn't keep up.

This was my first Android (or any other operating system) tablet. I have had it now for about three days, and will be returning it to Amazon after the weekend, minus many hours of grief.1) Device arrived.  Opened box, looked at the instruction booklet. Yes, I read instruction booklets. This one though has difficult to read black type on a stack of brown paper, each page about the size of a playing card. What a silly way to have an instruction booklet. They should have left it out, I got something useable with a web download.2) The tablet felt heavier in my hand than I expected. My error, it is typical of high end tablets, I was just surprised at the feel.3) The screen gets oily from fingers really fast.  Kind of disgusting in fact.4) The instructions said \"Before first time use, fully charge the battery.\"  There were pictures showing how to hook up the charger to the tablet and a wall outlet. It was not clear whether turning the tablet on was first time use or whether one could turn it on but just not play with it.  In any case I plugged it in and nothing happened. Seemed strange, one would think there should be some indication that the thing was charging. I contacted Samsung and through a chat with a technician we worked through a variety of things, switching cables, plugging into a computer. Finally an icon appeared, and that was supposed to be the signal that it was charging! But the icon just as suddenly disappeared. The chat person disappeared too, claiming that I had exhausted my time.5) I still needed to know when the battery was fully charged. The technician said \"six hours\". Seemed like a long time, but that is what I waited. Not sure why the instructions would hide this fact. The technician did not seem to know whether \"Before using\" meant before turning the tablet on the first time or before using the tablet, i.e. going through the setups.6) Once the six hours were over I turned the tablet on and it worked.  I think the problem with the \"charging icon\" was that the screen was automatically shutting down after a few seconds. I don't know, I set the screen so that it would say on for much longer. I am sure this will cut battery life, but otherwise constant shutting the screen while one was trying to do something was irritating.7) The number of applications and capabilities of the tablet was overwhelming. I had to set up cloud things I had only heard of and did not plan to use. Ordinarily with a new Windows desktop or laptop I know how to get rid of all the bloat and just start adding software one by one.  I used to curse Windows for not giving the flexibility I wanted, without a lot of effort. But that was before I was exposed to Android.8) Take the simple task of adding wallpaper.  Fairly straightforward, either from reading the instructions or just playing around. Except that the choices are very limited, none appealing to me. What I wanted was a very dark gray background. That is what I like, what ordinarily might be classified as \"none\" on a menu. Could not find it, went on the web searching for what to do, was directed to \"free\" wall paper sites that had even worse wallpaper and I never was able to navigate through the sales pitches to download any. There was no information I could find about where \"wallpaper\" was stored in the device, or the dimensions of the graphics required. I ended up doing something in a graphics program on my desktop computer and then emailing it to me on the tablet, as an attached file. Now I have to get the attached file into something called the Gallery folder, and then should be able to choose it as wallpaper. But really, that much effort, just to select wallpaper that is essentially no wallpaper?9) The microSD slot has a cover. Good luck opening it with a standard male fingernail. Once you do get it open all you can think of is that if you have to do it more than a few times you will certainly break it. The instructions call for sliding the card gently into the slot, until it seats with a click. Typical. Only it did not seat. Again, my fingernails were not long enough. I did finally get the card to stay deep in the slot, and closed the door.10) The MicroSD was not recognized by the tablet. Instructions told me what to do to \"mount\" the card, but they did not work, that is, I followed the instructions until I came to a screen that did not have the menu option the instructions said would be there.11) I removed the MicroSD card. That was a job, again unless you have very long and thin fingernails it is extremely difficult. But I managed to remove it, and the screen did show a message that the SD had been removed. I reinserted it and removed it several times, but still was not able to mount it.12) I like the stylus feature. I like the fact that whenever you get someplace and you can't figure out how to get out of it you can press a \"home\" button that takes you home. I like the fact that it picked up my home wireless network and I was immediately and simply able to log on.  The screen is great. Writing with the stylus is great. Even typing on the virtual keyboard with my thick fingers worked well.  Maybe if I were in my teens and had lots of hours to play with the tablet to learn how to do things I would be happier with it, but already I have wasted many hours trying to straighten out the battery charging, and still haven't fixed the microcard problem, after many hours. Maybe some day in the distant future I will try again, but for now I am finished with it.13) One, two, maybe up to 10 icons are useful. But so many icons for so many applications, I feel like I am in an Egyptian tomb trying to decipher things.", "Date": "November 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Caveat Emptor", "Author": "A steady customer [100+ purchases]", "ReviewID": "R33GK9XO4ZZEUO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Once I understand this device, I am sure it will excel.

While I am not an Apple \"fan boy\", I currently use an Iphone 4 and am very happy with my Ipad 2.  I was very unimpressed with Apple's new phones and heard wonderful things about the Samsung Galaxy 3 and the Note 3.  Because I wanted to know more before I committed to a new operating system for my phone, I opted for the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition as it has the operating system and style closest to the Note 3.I'm pretty disappointed.I've now spent about 6 hours trying to understand the Android operating system.  I don't mean I was staring blankly at it, rather that the system is not very intuitive.  Maybe it's just the years I've spent with Apple, I understand how to get to what I need.I really wanted to like this device.  To be able to say, \"Wow!  This does \"fill in the blank\" so much better than Apple\".  But I can't.  I can't find one thing of importance that this device does that the Ipad does not do better.  Am I missing something?  Definitely possible.  I have noticed that Android's app selections are nowhere near as robust and diverse as Apple's.  That's pretty disappointing.There is still an awful lot I just don't understand about the device.  I don't understand what benefit there is to a stylus.  It seems to harken back to the old Palm Pilot days.I love the fact that there is an expansion slot and yet for as nice as that is, the awkwardness in trying to delete an app or change a setting really seems to mar the overall experience.I'm 46 so it's not like I'm standing on my lawn, shaking my fist and yelling for kids to \"get off my lawn\", that being said, this product makes me scratch my head.
