[...]For those who are looking at getting the best tablet out there at the moment, this is the one you should be looking at.My profile: Heavy tablet users for personal and business purposes.  I work on my tablet around 4-5 hours a day (Email / Documents / Spreadsheet / PDF ) and use it 1-2 hours for personal use such as watching movies or reading books/magazine.  Tablet is my go-to device for all internet related search I do.I have the following and/or used the following before:1) iPad 12) iPad 23) iPad 44) iPad Mini5) Kindle Fire6) Kindle Fire HD7) Kindle Fire HD 8.98) Asus Transformer with Keyboard9) Nexus 7 First Gen10) iPad Air 16gb WifiAs you can see, I been through many devices and hope this review with my experience helps users decide if this is the right device for them. This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this next year.  For comparison sake, I will use last year's Kindle and iPad mini as they are the closest size to this HDX 7\"Speed (9/10):This is leaps and bounds faster than last year Kindle HD.  Last year Kindle struggles to go through any HD video content I put in.  This year's HDX able to play seamlessly all the HD 1080p contents I added.  It is incredible how much the 2.2Ghz quad processor improved vs last year's model Dual 1.2Ghz.Screen (9/10):This is the biggest improvement over last year's model.  The screen is in true HD 1080p (1920x1080).  This means any HD content I throw at it will view in its intended resolution.  The screen is crystal clear (much better than iPad mini) and the viewing angle is incredible.  I have this Kindle hanged in the middle of the car and at any seat it is view very clearly.  Last year's model was not as clear as this.  This is excellent for my minivan with my kids watching all the HD movies.  The brightness of the screen is also much brighter than last year's modelSound(8/10):The sound system in this Kindle Fire HDX is using Dolby Digital Plus with virtual 5.1 surround sound.  That gives this device a much better surround sound then previous generation's.Build (8/10):This HDX is more \"angular\" than last year's device.  It's slightly rougher to hold in the corners than last year's model due to sharper edges though I doubt any users will hold their tablet by their corners.  The device is noticeable lighter (395g for Kindle Fire HD vs 303g for Kindle Fire HDX).  This mean you can hold this for longer time without fatigue.The power and volume button placement on this Kindle Fire HDX is interesting.  It is behind the device which allows it to hide away from front view.  However, this can cause user to accidentally hit the on/off button or the volume button when not being careful.  Aesthetically it is great but it is definitely not a practical solution when you are trying to use this on the go.It does look sturdy enough to survive minor drop but I highly recommend getting a case for it.  Those sharp corners seems more prone to dents than round corners for last year's model.Battery (6/10):This is probably the biggest drawback for this device.  The battery life is not as good as last year's model.  This is quite logical as last year's HD has a 4400mAh battery while running 720p while this HDX runs Full HD 1080p but runs only on a 4500mAh battery (only 100mAh more than last year).  The 1080p screen pulls a lot of power vs last year's model when the screen is on, especially when running HD videos.  I'm able to achieve 5 hours of heavy use compare to 7 hours for last year's Kindle Fire HD at medium brightness with Wi-fi on all the time.  I tend to bring around an external battery pack but prefer something that is integrated (like a battery case)Software & software compatibility (8/10):The amount of app is still lacking compare to App store or Play store but has been steadily increasing which is a great sign. Games and software boot time has increased noticeably and compatibility is not an issueSilk browser has definitely improved compare to last year's tablet with multiple tabs actually now usable on the HDX.  For last year's version, it is practically unusable after 2 tabs due to the lack of hardware resource on the tablet (especially when the website is not optimized for mobile use).  The HDX has no problem going through any webpages I throw at it.Hopefully more apps will be optimized to use quad core soon.  I'm guessing some of these apps are only optimized for last year's dual core.I haven't got the opportunity to use Mayday yet but will review about it once I get more update on this.Complimentary Accessories (3/10):For all smart devices, one of the most important time is the number of accessories available.  At launch, it is understandable the lack of accessories but productivity focus accessories such as integrated case/keyboard are missing at launch.  This is rather disappointing as it can be a powerful productivity device with the right accessories attached.  Also the lack of case selection is quite astonishing for a flagship product on Amazon.  Hope there will be more cases such as battery case (due to above battery problem) or rugged case come out soon.Price (9/10):I got the special offer model at 16Gb (lowest end model) and it is enough for me to use.  The special offer ads are not intrusive like last year's model and sometimes does reveal some items I want. Compare to the ipad mini, this is practically a steal.  For those with the Nexus 7, it is quite comparable in price.Conclusion in one sentence: Amazon's iPad mini killer (8.5/10)For people who are justifying if this is a good upgrade, I say YES to that.  The speed and screen difference alone is worth the upgrade.  The whole user experience just improve drastically with the HDX.It use to be, for Kindle Fire HD, you will trade low price for slow performance, stutter and lag.  It honestly makes you think twice if the price is really worth all that poor experience.For HDX, this is no longer the case.  You get both great price, great screen and great performance that surpasses iPad mini. To me, the HDX is seriously Amazon's iPad killer.  It really marks how well Amazon has done to make themselves a worthy competitor in the tablet market. I hope some software upgrade or battery pack can make this the ultimate road warrior!****************************Dec 23th 2013 - 2 months  update *********************************So I have been using between this HDX 7\" and the 8.9\" HDX.  I also been using an iPad Air 16Gb Wifi and here are some updates, particular on the negative points mentioned previously.App Store - not so refined still.  Downloading and Installing problem occursThe app store after 2 month is still a bit lacking.  There are some freebie deals during cyber monday which I jumped (who doesn't like free stuff?)but still nothing that either the Apple App store or Google Play don't have.  Amazon App store really needs some exclusive apps to become a \"must get\" device.Now comes the bad part - I tried to download Magic 2014 game (big fan of Magic the Gathering since teen) from the Amazon App Store and the HDX 7\" downloads this rather slowly.  In fact, I noticed that when it reaches 50% it drops back down to 30% and redownloads the package again!  Since I'm not in a rush I really have no issue with this re-download problem.  However, this can be problem to some people who have limited bandwidth per month and won't appreciate redownloading the same thing again 2 times (or more but I didn't catch that).Once it reaches 100%, the app store attempts to install the software.  It goes into \"Installing...\" state for a while (at least couple hours).  Knowing that there's something weird going on, I rebooted the HDX 7\".  Once I rebooted it, the software shows it was never downloaded!Perhaps there's some application specific problem with this game but this really shows a rather poor experience on the Amazon Kindle Fire HDX.  I would expect a brand new top of the line Kindle Fire HDX would have ironed out simple bugs such as this but clearly, the Amazon App Store have 2 things it needs to work on:1) If this is an application specific error, Amazon needs to proactively test this release on all their devices before allowing it on the Amazon App Store.  It's quite obvious if any Amazon App store guys have even tried to install this Magic 2014 game that it just won't install.  Literally half the reviews on the review complain about this2) For these buggy release, Amazon should proactively pull this application from the store - the experience that lead to all the hours of download and wasted bandwidth got the user nothing in the end.  I can imagine some users with capped bandwidth or using their cell data to download will be furious if they know an app less than 1Gb rack them couple Gb of download.App Store is a big part of Amazon's Kindle Fire ecosystem and poor experience such as this really deters client in continued use, especially when all Kindle Fire are locked down to Amazon software ecosystem.  When you cannot even use the Amazon software ecosystem, any excellent hardware that this machine has becomes inaccessible and worse of all, a waste of user time to figure out.Now most people may say this criticism is related to the game(in this case, Magic 2014).  I believe this is not the case.  The responsibility of Downloading and Installing of the Magic 2014 application belongs to the Amazon App Store (after all, it is Amazon App Store people who authorized this to be released in their store). I start to find all other game download and installation questionable and my own usage time in App store browsing and purchasing drops drastically.From the above download experience, I did attempt to find some help from Amazon.  Here is where the more problem arises.Mayday - speaking to rep reading off outdated troubleshooting guidesAfter noticing my Magic 2014 download is gone, I attempted to contact Amazon through the Mayday button.  It's really my first time using this function so I don't really have any prior experience in using it.My Mayday call was picked up by Hayley (if I recall).  You can see a big Amazon logo in the background beside the customer service rep and she looks pretty friendly.  I explained my situation with the App store problem to Hayley but it seems she wasn't able to help; therefore I got transfer to a \"Tech Advisor\".  This Tech Advisor can't be shown in the video camera and asks for my credentials.  She also made me explain the problem again which I explained to Hayley (I would have thought someone will note down my problem as I need to use couple mins to explain again).  She then pulls something that you expect from an Indian Call Center by asking me to disconnect my internet modem.  I find this rather funny as I mentioned this is a software specific problem with the installation and has nothing to do with my modem or Internet connection.  I also mentioned that I am running a server at home and pulling the modem disconnects it from the Internet which breaks other services I am running unintentionally.  She seems to be stuck so she forward me to another representative (which if I heard correctly, it is the app store support rep).Once I got connected to the 3rd rep, they ask me to check my tablet date and time (which is correct).  This rep later ask me to press on options that are not the screen.  I suspected this rep was reading off an old Fire OS troubleshooting guide as I recently updated the Fire OS system and that some options and buttons are changed.  Given the large amount of time spent and there's no resolution, I went to my iPad air and downloaded the game successfully in couple mins while still have Amazon on the Mayday call.  I informed the 3rd tech support of this and thank them for their time although there was no resolution in the end.I very much prefer having the game on my Kindle HDX as the 7\" is perfect to bring outside for quick game or two, but the amount of time spent on troubleshooting and resource wasted on this is honestly not worth my time.  I ended up having to play this game on the iPad Air larger screen but also paid for in app purchase because the game itself is very good.It's a good lesson to learn that the whole software user experience needs to be more streamline and fluid on the Kindle.  Amazon has done successfully in the physical good purchasing section of the kindle fire (in fact I spent thousands of dollars more on Amazon.com using the kindle fire than on PC and very satisfy with the results) and that if it can bring the same experience to the software app store just like the physical store, Amazon will have a winner here. I use my machine extensively for magazine reading / internet browsing but when it comes to app download, I currently have my doubts if it will be another bandwidth hog and a waste of time.Display - blue hue appears but not very apparentSome people ask if the blue hue appears on the edge.  I can notice this if I'm reading off a totally white page (like a ebook or magazine).  However it is not very noticeable and that your eyes will ignore it eventually.  After all, words or graphic don't appear on the edges of the screen.Battery life - Still needs work onAfter the OS update, there seems to be a slight improvement with the battery life.  However, still not enough for me to really go through the day without bringing an external battery charger pack along.  At the moment, I am still looking for a 2 in 1 case + battery solution but it is not available.  I hope this can be my daily driver but without the battery life, it may just be a brick by the afternoon.Purchasing on Amazon.com - becomes addictive (Could be good or bad for some people!)I realized my spending on Amazon went up considerable compare to last year thanks to this Kindle Fire HDX.  I will be browsing it online and have these items saved on screen, constantly reminding me to get it.  Amazon really done a good job at this and really met, if not, exceed their goal in getting users buying from kindle fire.  With last year fire, the browsing experience on Amazon.com was not nearly as fluid as this year's HDX.  This makes it hard to keep my attention and urge to buy.  For people who wants a good purchasing experience, this Kindle Fire HDX will surely provide that.  For ones who need to save money, you may want to get your finger off the buy button!My overall rating stays the same as Amazon keeps knocking off prices for these machines making it still the best bang for the buck.Apr 28 Update - Family Use----------------------------------------------Got my kids an extra Kindle Fire HDX 7\" for them to play with.  My HDX 7\" is still running well with all my Instant Video and newsstand subscription inside.Since my kids don't treat their new toys with much care, I went and got them and myself a zerolemon EVA Case on Amazon.  The case is useful for prevent dents and major falls on your Kindle.  Even with my Kindle, the top pantel where the speakers are started to peel off a bit (amazon used glue to assemble the speaker grille top panel).  Case works great for hiding some of the blemishes of the kindle fire hdx 7\"Overall still satisfied with my machine and frankly been the best bang for the buck tablet i ever have.As mentioned, I will update this review periodically.  Next time I will focus on physical wear and tear of the machine after couple more months and again on battery life (as all electronics have a diminishing battery duration throughout its course of use). [...] Thanks for reading!", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent 3rd-generation tablet that compares favorably to the competition", "Author": "NF", "ReviewID": "R2KVHBC7NMNOGU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the middle model of the three models that Amazon is shipping this year: the Kindle Fire HD, the Kindle Fire HDX (this tablet), and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\". This is the successor for last year's Kindle Fire HD but with an updated operating system and new features, a redesigned shell (with the power and volume control buttons more readily accessible), an absolutely amazing display, superb sound, an included power adapter, and the new Mayday feature. See http://www.amazon.com/review/RNH700DOM9WN3/ for my review of the Kindle Fire HD and http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YPITHVTYLCZT for my review of the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\".Update: Some users are reporting a bluish glow around the edges of the screen for the HDX. If you search on YouTube for HDX Blue Haze, you can find a video showing the issue. Amazon has updated their \"Learn More\" link with the following info:\"To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7\" at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20% improvement in power efficiency.\"\"As a result of using these blue LEDs, you may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. All displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy.\"If this is something that you think would bother you, I'd recommend taking a look at the YouTube video or taking a look at the HDX at a local Best Buy or office superstore. I've also uploaded a user image here of my HDX with a book loaded so that you can see the blue glow (http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B00DOPNO4M/).The Amazon tablets are primarily content consumption devices, best suited for connecting to the Amazon ecosystem, including videos, music, books, apps, and so on. With the free Prime trial subscription, you can check out the Prime Instant Video options and watch movies and shows at no charge for 30 days. For videos, music, and books, the Amazon selection is at or near the top of the list; for apps, much less so. 90% of the top 100 apps are available on Amazon.com, as well as 100,000 others, but that's only a small fraction of what is available with Google or Apple.It's not quite as bad as it sounds because, while the competition has ten times as many apps, most of those apps are, um ... how shall I put this ... less than stellar (look up Sturgeon's Law). If there are specific apps you need or want, you definitely should double-check before purchasing to make sure that they are available. The apps that will likely never become available on the Kindle Fire ecosystem are those apps that require Google services (i.e., anything that uses Google location services). One ameloriating factor is that it is possible to side-load most of the apps from the Google Play store onto an Amazon tablet and a web search on side-loading apps onto Kindle Fire will show dozens of websites with detailed instructions. If the app you are sideloading requires a Google service to work, though, it will not run on the Fire, even if you manage to successfully install it.Like the other Kindle Fire tablets, as well as the Apple iPad and the Google Nexus, the Kindle tablet line doesn't have a micro-SD slot, so the assumption is that you're consuming content from the cloud. This is fine when you're using your tablet with wifi; not so good when you're traveling and want to load up your tablet with content for the trip. If the latter is something you expect to do regularly, you might want to consider the 32GB or 64GB versions, or pay the additional price for the 4G version, which is available on the 7\" tablet for the first time. Also, if all of your content is on iTunes or on Google Play, you would have to side-load everything onto the tablet. As is true of Apple and Google tablets, there's no way to automatically connect to the cloud storage of the competition.Something new this year is the ability to download Prime Instant Videos. I verified that I can download Prime Instant Videos to my Kindle Fire HDX. However, that option is not available for all movies and TV shows. It looks like they had to get the permission of the studios and not all of them said yes. So, for example, I was able to download \"Casablanca\" but not able to download \"The Avengers\" even though both are part of the Prime Instant Video collection and both are available for free streaming.Update: Adding a bit from a reply in the comments: Amazon is clearly looking at the Enterprise market with this launch, at least based on the details they provide. They've added full accessibility support (required in order to get government contracts), will be bringing support for VPN and business printing, have a better email client with tighter integration to Exchange, and are including OfficeSuite for productivity. There are other productivity tools available in their app store, as well, although both Google and Apple, particularly the latter, have more options. When VPN support arrives, I'll definitely be taking a look, as it would be nice to not have to lug my laptop home every night.So how does this Kindle Fire HDX differ from the previous generation Kindle Fire HD?Display: 1920x1200 (323 ppi) vs 1280x800 (216 ppi). It's more than that, though, as the colors are richer, brighter, with better contrast. This display has been judged by many reviewers as the best in its class and I would have to agree. Amazon has also added technology to automatically adjust the contrast and brightness when viewing the tablet in bright sunlight. While there is definitely a noticeable improvement, this isn't what you need for reading on the beach. For that, you'll need an eInk reader like the Kindle Paperwhite.Sound: As far as I can tell, the sound is about the same. This was already one of the best-sounding tablets on the market, with Dolby stereo output and enough power to actually make it possible to listen to music or video without requiring headphones.Size and Weight: Noticeably lighter (10.7 oz vs. 13.9 oz) and noticeably smaller (7.3\" x 5.0\" x 0.35\" vs. 7.6\" x 5.4\" x 0.4\"). This is a comfortable tablet to hold one-handed, even for long periods of time.Processor: It's a *lot* faster (2.2GHz quad-core, top-of-the-line CPU, compared to 1.2GHz dual-core). This tablet is amazingly fast and smooth, with the fastest processor in its class. Every game I've tried on it has run smoothly, with no hesitations, slowdowns, or glitches. Scrolling through content is amazingly smooth and fast now, without the hesitations and occasional slowdowns of the previous generations.Build: A redesigned shell with power and volume control buttons that are easy to find! This is a solid build but the back of the shell is something of a fingerprint magnet. Since most of us will be buying a case to put the tablet in, that may not be an issue.Camera: If there is a difference between last year's camera and this year's, I'm not able to see it. It's a high-def camera suitable for video-conferencing or Skype. Like last year's model, there is no rear camera. If this is important to you, you'll need the 8.9\" version.HDMI Output: This is the one area where last year's model wins. Amazon has removed the HDMI out connector from its tablet line (but see the description above for details on how Amazon is providing a software solution for sharing your tablet screen on your television). No other tablet that I'm aware of has this functionality so if this is something you need, you should be able to purchase one of last year's models fairly cheaply.Battery Life: The same, at 11 hours. However, Amazon has added a special \"reading mode\" to the device, which they claim will extend the battery life to as much as 17 hours. I did not test this. For my own personal use, the battery life is adequate.Price: It's more expensive ($229 vs. $199) but this year they include a power adapter, which was a $20 extra last year, so the actual difference in price is $10. For what you're getting, that price increase is definitely justified.It has an updated OS and updated feature software (including the free unlimited Mayday customer support feature). The software updates include the ability to download some Prime Instant Videos to your device and watch them offline, enhanced accessibility, enhanced enterprise controls and features (so now it's better suited for office work), enhanced email client, enhanced parental controls, improved X-Ray features (now including lyrics for music, as well as additional information for both books and movies), integration with GoodReads (coming soon), and the like.Where I noticed the biggest difference was the home screen. The default view is still the carousel but if you swipe upward, you'll see a more traditional icon view. The \"Recommended for you\" display on the home screen is now smaller and much less obtrusive (and it can be turned off in the settings). Amazon has also added multi-tasking of a sort, where swiping up from the bottom of the screen while you're in an app shows you the 20 most-recently-used items from your home screen, so you can quickly switch from one app to another without returning to the home screen.There is also a left panel available on most screens (but not the home screen) and in some of the apps, with navigation links and settings to make it easier to navigate and control your tablet or to navigate within the app. If you tap the center of your display and then swipe left while you're reading a book, for example, you'll see a panel that shows you the table of contents, the About the Author link, the Sync to Furthest Page Read link, and so on.The Kindle FreeTime option and the parental controls are still among the best in the business. If you want a tablet for a child and want to control what they can access, how long they can use the tablet at any given time, and the like, Amazon has you covered.You can now also schedule \"Quiet Time\" on the tablet, where notification sounds and pop-up notifications are disabled, either on a temporary basis by simply pushing a button or on a scheduled basis. Frankly, I doubt I'll ever use this feature but if you're the type who likes to read or watch video until you fall asleep, it's kind of nice to be able to disable all sounds so that you don't get rudely awakened when, e.g., someone plays a new word in your Words with Friends game.Mayday: This is a huge gamble by Amazon and it will be interesting to see whether it pays off. This isn't a feature for a techie like me and I didn't use it (although I was sorely tempted). From the commercials, it's pretty amazing, particularly that you can get a live chat in a matter of a minute or less (Amazon's goal is something like 15 seconds, I believe, although I can't help wondering what will happen on Christmas Day!). If you're thinking of getting a tablet for a technophobe, the addition of this feature may make the Kindle Fire HDX your best choice.How does this tablet rank against the competition? There are really only two other tablets in its class currently: the Google Nexus 7 and the just-announced Apple iPad Mini with Retina Display.Display: All three devices have retina displays, with the 7\" HDX and the Nexus at 1920x1200 (323 ppi) and the 8\" iPad Mini at 2048x1536 (326 ppi). All three displays are stunning. Amazon claims that it has enhanced the ability to read the display in bright sunlight, something that's a problem for all such devices. While this wouldn't be my first choice to read by the pool (I'd pick the Paperwhite), I can testify that it is easier to view the display in bright sunlight than its predecessors.It's worth noting that the aspect ratio of the HDX and Nexus is 16:10 while the aspect ratio of the iPad Mini is 4:3. Where this matters is watching video. If you're watching an old television show, a 4:3 aspect ratio is fine. If you're watching a high-def movie, the 4:3 aspect ratio is going to leave large black bars on your screen and the video will be much more compressed than it would be on the HDX and Nexus. Apple chose to maintain backward compatibility with prior devices rather than moving up.Sound: The HDX has Dolby Digital Surround Sound; the Nexus has Frauenhofer Surround Sound; the iPad Mini has stereo sound. The iPad Mini also makes the same mistake that Amazon made in its first-generation tablet: putting both speakers on the same side (in this case, at the bottom of the tablet). If you're watching a video, you'll have the tablet turned sideways and the sound will all come from the same side. The HDX, in contrast, has the speakers placed perfectly for video watching.Networking: The HDX and the iPad Mini both have dual band, dual antenna (MIMO) Wi-Fi. The Nexus is dual band but not dual antenna. All things being equal, I would expect the Nexus to lag a bit behind the others in networking performance, particularly in areas where the connection is spotty.Size and Weight:HDX: 7.3\" x 5.0\" x 0.35\" and 10.7 oz.Nexus: 7.9\" x 4.5\" x 0.34\" and 10.24 oz.iPad Mini: 7.87\" x 5.3\" x 0.29\" and 11.68 oz.There's really nothing to choose from here. All three are small, thin, and light. The iPad Mini is the heaviest but it also has a slightly larger screen.Processor:HDX: 2.2 GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor, 2GB memoryNexus: 1.5GHz quad-core Snapdragon S4 Pro, 2GB memoryiPad Mini: 64-bit dual-core A7, 1GB memoryThe HDX and iPad come out ahead of the Nexus on processing power while the HDX and Nexus come out ahead of the iPad Mini on memory. The A7 is only a dual-core processor but according to some tech sites that have run benchmarks, it definitely holds its own against the quad-core Snapdragon. These are all pretty powerful tablets.Cameras: Both the Nexus and the iPad Mini have 1.2 MP front and 5MP rear cameras. The HDX only has a front-facing camera. If you expect to take pictures with your tablet, the HDX isn't for you.Battery Life: HDX = 11 hours (17 hours when reading); Nexus = 9 hours; iPad Mini = 10 hours. Amazon wins this one, particularly if you will be spending a lot of time reading.Expansion: None of them have a microSD slot; they all assume that you'll be using their respective cloud systems.Parental Controls: All of them have the basic parental controls that allow you to limit your child's access to content, purchases, the web, and so on. Amazon goes farther, though, with the Kindle Free Time and Kindle Free Time Unlimited options, the latter of which is an inexpensive subscription to a curated library of content. If you are buying a first tablet for a child, I'd choose the Kindle Fire HD. At only $139, it is significantly cheaper and it has all of the options that the HDX has.Enterprise: As soon as Amazon releases its update, it will add VPN and network printing support. I believe all of the tablets have basic enterprise capabilities, including that support and various office apps. For real productivity, though, personally I'd go with a laptop, not a tablet.Support: Amazon wins this category, hands down, with the new Mayday system. Apple comes in second, with Apple and Amazon usually taking top marks in any customer support survey. This is an area where Google does not shine.Price: The HDX and Nexus win this one, hands down. Both are priced at $229 vs. $399 for the new iPad Mini. Neither Google nor Amazon makes much, if any, money on their tablets; they're counting on you to purchase content from their respective stores.From my own perspective, there is no single clear winner, as each tablet has strengths and weaknesses. If you already have Amazon Prime, the HDX is a no-brainer, with the access to the Prime Instant Video and the Kindle Owners' Lending Library. If you're primarily buying a tablet to read with, Amazon wins there, as well, with the 17-hour battery life while reading and the best display for reading outdoors. If you want apps, Apple and Google both have far more choices. If you want to watch movies, I'd pick either the HDX or the Nexus, as Apple's aspect ratio and its lagging sound put it at the back of the pack. If price is a factor, then you should pick either the HDX or the Nexus.If you're heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem, i.e., you already own an iPhone or iPad and all of your content is on iTunes, the HDX really isn't the tablet for you. Similarly, if you love browsing Google Play for apps to play on your Samsung Galaxy phone, you're likely to be disappointed in the section available on Amazon (although, as I note above, most of the Google Play apps can be sideloaded onto the tablet). If you love your Google Now or Siri, neither of which will ever be available on Amazon, this isn't the tablet for you.The bottom line: This tablet is primarily intended as a viewport into Amazon content and Amazon services. If you have Amazon Prime and you have Amazon eBooks in your collection, this tablet is a no-brainer. The price is low, particularly for what you get, and it's a small, light, high-quality, high-powered, tablet with a stunning display and superb sound. This really is one of the top tablets in its class.Note: As others have noted, the tablet will update its software when you first turn it on and connect to wifi. Unlike some others, I had no trouble with this operation, no glitches or crashes. It took several minutes but the process ran smoothly, as did the tablet when everything was done.Update:Now that I have a Kindle Fire HD and a Kindle Fire HDX tablet, I'm in a little better position to talk about which one I'd recommend:You should get the Kindle Fire HDX if:- You're a techie who wants the latest and greatest, the best display, the fastest processor.- You need a camera for Skype or other video app.- You play graphics-intensive games (e.g., racing games).- The size and weight matter to you, even in such small increments as this.- You think you will need the Mayday technical support.You should get the Kindle Fire HD if:- Price is a factor. $90 cheaper is not an insignificant amount. This really is an excellent value for the money.- You want an inexpensive tablet for a child (and, for this case, the lack of a camera might well be a plus)- All you want is a basic tablet for reading books, playing music, watching the occasional video, playing Words with Friends, and the like. While the screen on the HD isn't as stunning as is it on the HDX, this is still a true HD screen and it is very good.I check back pretty regularly, so if you have a question, please feel free to ask and I'll do my best to answer it.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice Tablet with Sharp Display", "Author": "Michael Gallagher", "ReviewID": "R23F7ENQQQYOVN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "To sum up what I will tell you about in the details below, for $229 you are getting a good deal on a tablet computer - especially if you compare it to the $199 for last year's first-generation Fire HD and the $500 or more you can spend on a Wi-Fi version of the iPad. Overall, if you consider the price and the functionality I think this is a great tool / toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device: the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and the new HD Fire.  If you are a first-time tablet buyer, where price vs. value is a key consideration, or if you are looking for an affordable tablet for the kids, I'd recommend the \"regular\" Kindle Fire HD that is only $139.  If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of that one.My review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the Fire HDX to the original Fire HD as well as this year's model of the Fire HD, but also some of the features for a first-time user.Consistent with my experience with setup of this year's model of the Kindle Fire HD, setup took a long time: despite being a brand new product, the Fire HDX attempted to download and install several operating software updates.  Software updates on a Kindle are usually in the background, and it was annoying watching the crashes and manual reboots.  Consistent with the Fire HD, it crashed during setup, playing a song, watching a TV show, and reading a book.  It took a little over an hour to get this thing up and running without consistent crashes but after the final software update it has worked as expected without further issues.Screen Display / Video Playback:This version of the Fire has the absolute best screen display of any Fire model to date. Looking at the technical specs Amazon made some major changes in the display / resolution, and the picture appears more crisp: I compared the viewing experience watching with my standard test of the Fire devices over the past couple of years - don't laugh - the first episode of the Wonder Woman TV series from the 70's. The display on this Fire was one heck of a lot better in terms of sharpness than last year's model as well as this year's model of the Fire HD. For you technical folks out there, the display is 1,920 x 1,200 with 50% more pixels per inch than the Fire HD.Wi-Fi Connectivity:The initial Wi-Fi setup took some time as it wouldn't remember the password for my router after each software update / crash / reboot series.  After the final operating software update I mentioned above, however, it was fairly easy to connect to the Internet via Wi-Fi.My standard test for trying out new gadgets is to see how fast they run side-by-side with a known piece of equipment doing the same test at the best place of Wi-Fi in my house and the worst place where it drags. In this comparison, I had this HDX version of the Fire sitting next to last year's and this year's version of the HD Fire, as well as last year's 8.9\" HD Fire, Motorola RAZR smartphone, my iPad 2 (yes, the Kindle guy uses an iPad for work), and the first-generation 7\" Fire (the model from two years ago) all just using a Wi-Fi connection vs. cellular connectivity.My \"normal\" website test is to hit the mobile websites of FoxNews, CNN, my personalized Yahoo page, Google, and the Houston Chronicle. The ones that were usually slow on the other devices were faster on the HDX (Houston Chronicle and CNN), and for the other sites I couldn't tell a difference in speed at the location closest to my router. When I went to the slowest / worst reception location of my house, the speed did have a noticeable difference in the other devices as this one was a little bit faster than all but last year's model of the 7\" Kindle Fire HD; yes, it was also faster than this year's model of the Fire HD but I attribute the increase in speed to the dual antennas on the HDX.Sound / Music Playback:The two speakers are located in the back of the Kindle Fire in two not-noticeable ports: one on the top and one on the bottom. My test of this feature was cranking up Van Halen's Panama to maximum volume (I always want to see if it could really play the guitar licks), and I would alternate covering one speaker up over the other: you have true stereo sound with no degradation of the sound that makes you think you are about to blow the speaker.  The Dolby speakers sound nice and you do get to hear the bass.  However, I am still of the opinion the speakers aren't going to do very well being placed in the back as I am in the front: I want to be able to hear whatever I am listening to without really having to crank it up and disturbing someone else in the room (that's what happens when you start losing your hearing like I am).  While the cover for this version has not shipped yet - why aren't the covers released at the same time? - I imagine the sound quality might decrease with a cover in the back over the speakers.  The X-ray feature is pretty neat as it displays the lyrics on the screen if you are so inclined; if you are not, it is as simple as the tap of an icon to make the lyric feature go away.Email Setup:Consistent with previous versions of the Fire, email setup was very easy for my main Gmail account, both with the software came with the Fire but my primary use of an existing app called Enhanced Email I purchased here in the Amazon app store. I did setup the email app that came with the program with no problem - it took about a minute to setup my main Google account - and I was able to send and receive emails as well as synch my online calendar via Google's calendar and contacts. For those of you asking yourself why am I using the Enhanced Email program, the simple answer is like many of you I have more than one email account: you can quickly switch back and forth on the accounts with the tool. The lazy person in me appreciates that as I don't like getting out of the lazy chair once I'm settled in!New Tabs and Screen Layout:In addition to the normal tabs Amazon has continued to make tweaks with the look and feel to the overall display such as more things to scroll through to find what you are looking for in an easier manner. Interestingly, and consistent with my experiences with this year's model of the Fire HD, I purchased the one with special offers and the only ad I have seen so far is on the main screen saver vs. being overwhelmed with ads like last year's model.Reading Books:Turning pages is pretty darn easy - just tap the side of the screen to go to the next page or back a page, or you can swipe your finger across the screen to do the same.  Amazon did add the feature to see the book's description for books on your device like they have with the e-Ink Kindle (always an annoyance with last year's model), which is a plus as I can't remember what each book in my digital to-be-read pile is about; getting to the book description, requires several taps on the screen to eventually get to where you want to be.  If there is an easier way to do it, I can't find it and maybe I should be one of the first guys, ever, to crack open the electronic user's manual to figure it out (doubt it).  For those of you who have wondered, you still can't organize your books into categories unless you purchase a third-party app</a> here in the Amazon app store.BluetoothThere is a Bluetooth connection, and I did my usual test of this feature by taking it out to my car and having the Fire stream music through my car stereo. There were no delays or skips with the connection, and it paired up in about a minute. Just make sure you give it a device name so you can recognize it and be recognized.Camera:There is a camera on this model - it faces the front or toward the user / reader.  Focusing and taking a picture is pretty easy, and Amazon will by default store your pictures in the Cloud - which counts against your storage allotment.  I'd recommend turning that automatic storage feature off unless you are sure you want it, because if you go over the limit that will provide Amazon another opportunity to collect a monthly revenue stream from you.Charger:Unlike previous models of the Fire, this one DOES include a charger!  If you're scratching your head with that comment, in previous models you had to purchase a charger separately for $20 which always seemed kind of silly for Amazon to do.\"Mayday\" button:A new feature with this model, and not included on this year's \"regular\" model of the Fire, is the introduction of the \"Mayday\" button.  Basically, you can touch the button and a video screen will pop up and you can actually see - and talk to - a live customer service agent.  I haven't pressed the button yet to try it out, as I think I would feel pretty dumb: when they ask me how can they help, I don't want to say \"I just wanted to see if this works and just stopped by to say `hi' for purposes of this review.\"What I Wish it Had: a case that was ready to go and shipped when the Fire was ready (why are we waiting).  A case is very important in order to protect your investment.  Also, I'm interested to see how they try to not hurt the speaker's performance I mentioned above due to the speakers being in the back of the unit and hopefully not covered up with a case.Overall, at $229 for the 16GB of memory model ($309 for 64 GB of memory) I think this is a good deal for someone who really uses the video / apps feature. Kids will love it as they can read books, play games, watch TV and movies, and a whole lot of other things. Adults should like it for the exact same reasons, but while I try to minimize the amount of work-related stuff I do at home with the business apps that are available here in the Amazon App store and other places around the Internet I can also work on Excel and Word-compatible files when I have to without having to fire up my work laptop or whatever the case may be. If you've never owned a tablet before, or are looking to upgrade from an earlier model Fire, I would recommend this one if video and apps are your thing - but make sure you purchase the higher memory one vs. the minimum 16 GB.  If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, or looking for a tablet for your younger children, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of last year's model or get this year's model of the Kindle Fire HD at $139.", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing Performance Worthy of Upgrade", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Goode & Eiffel\"", "ReviewID": "R3IO1X1FKICIE8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Netflix Issue:When I first got the KFHDX, I had no problems with Netflix.

If you already enjoy the Amazon ecosystem, crave responsively fast performance, love gorgeous high resolution screens, wish the Kindle Fire were noticeably lighter, all without sacrificing battery life, while being able to enjoy more benefits of Amazon Prime, plus many other great new features, then stop reading, save time, and hit the \"Add To Cart\" button and buy it.I wanted the Amazon ecosystem. I am a Prime member. I also own a Nexus phone, the Sony Xperia Tablet Z, and a few other Android devices, besides the original Kindle Fire. I don't mind that Kindle Fires don't have Google Play. I have other devices for that. My wife has the iPad 4.If this is going to be your only Android device, then the decision point is which do you prefer, the Google experience or Amazon experience? You can get most of the Amazon experience with a more conventional Android device.  The overlap is not as great going the other way around. However, with the new Fire OS, you do get a few more Amazon exclusive experiences. Weigh your needs and wants to make the best choice.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**SERVICE: Amazon service applies directly to this device since it is their product. Amazon had a one day only FAA 15% off sale for some of the Kindles. I opened up the MayDay and asked the rep if they would honor the discount to those who had previously made the purchase. I was told it would only apply for those who had made the purchase within the last 7 days. That was not me. The MayDay rep didn't really do anything wrong, but she just appeared as if she didn't care and seemed a little annoyed at my request. Because the customer CAN see the MayDay rep, in my mind, it would be very important that person have a smile and warm demeanor. I've done tech support for a business I once owned, and a simple thing like this can make a huge difference in how a customer perceives a company.I had also emailed Amazon, received a reply with a number, and gave that a call. The initial rep was kind enough to refer me to someone who could make that decision. The manager I spoke with made the decision to honor a partial refund, even though the 64GB model I had purchased was not one of the sale items. I didn't get the full 15%, but it was about 12% discount. I thought this was more than fair and I appreciated the fact that Amazon allows their service managers the freedom to make these kind of decision.I believe there were two factors in play. 1. My standing with Amazon as a shopper (not that they don't care about all their customers, but it's nice to be appreciated for being a loyal customer!) 2. I was still within my return window. I could have sent it back, bought the sale version and still come out ahead, in theory. It would have been a headache and extra cost for all involved, and this service manager was keen enough to save us all that headache. Even if I had to go that way, it's still great service that I could return the device this long after the purchase, for any reason.If I could make one request, it would be that there was a dedicated link within Amazon Shop for writing reviews. I find typing to be one of the more accurate experiences on the Fire HDX, much improved over original Fire, and would like to be able to write reviews straight from the new Fire HDX.After about 1.5 months use, I have no buyer's remorse. This is a great tablet and a great buy for Amazon fans.====================FIRST IMPRESSIONS====================The packaging, for those of you who care, was like looking at movie poster. It got you interested, excited and ready to open it up. Once the cover was opened, box unsealed, and then opened, the inside was simple and elegant. Inside is the Kindle Fire HDX, the 5 watt charger (not 9 watt), and a nice thick 5 foot long USB to micro-USB cord. That's it.Compared to the original Kindle Fire, the HDX 7\" is noticeably lighter and easier to hold. The angled edge harmoniously eases the hand into a comfortable holding position. This is great to hold! When holding landscape mode, the top, where the speakers are, is smooth glossy plastic. It attracts fingerprints but it actually adds to the grip. The Amazon logo that is recessed in the back is also this same gloss and also helps make the device less slippery to hold. Well done. Fortunately, those are the only places that are glossy plastic.Turning on the device, Amazon already had associated the device with my account. The carousel was familiar. But swipe up and there was the typical icon view.Overall, the device is snappy and responsive. No more lag. I love it! The screen is gorgeous. It rotates quickly from landscape to portrait. It's the best rotating screen I've experienced on any Android device so far, and I've had my share of Android devices.There are a myriad of new features to learn from the upgrade. So far, I like them - a lot. The Mojito OS does take some exploring to get fully adjusted. I'm still in that process after two hours of playing around.====================THE DETAILS====================-------------------------APPS (Added 2 DEC 2013):-------------------------One of the biggest CONS people mention about the Kindle Fire line is the lack of Google Play, which primarily means limited app choices. This is true. There are apps I wish I could get on the Kindle Fire HDX. For some this may be a deal killer. For me, it is not.Amazon has really gone above and beyond to make the lack of Google Play so much easier to take. Since I purchased the Kindle Fire HDX, it came with 500 Amazon coins. Within the Amazon Apps world, this translates to $5.00 to spend on any app. In the month plus I've been an owner, Amazon has offered a ton of free apps, good ones! In some cases, they offered a free app, plus more free coins. There seems to be no shortage of ways to get free coins. Even when I do spend the coins (and not my real money yet,) I've made a handful of purchases where I got more coins back, in one case, 250 coins just for making my first purchase using coins. Some of these deals equate to discounts of 30% or more.My new Kindle Fire HDX is loaded with games and apps I'd likely not have purchased on my own. Between this give-a-way fest and their daily free apps, I have a lot of great choices for full paid apps. Not all the daily free apps are very good, but some are. It's worth checking out, especially during this Thanksgiving/Christmas time period.The Kindle Fire is meant for consumption and Amazon has done a great job making sure I can do just that without breaking the bank. Amazon makes up for its shortcoming in the apps department by being far more generous than Google is with their store.With the current Cyber Monday sale, the Kindle Fire HDX is a steal! Let me reinforce that the Snapdragon 800 processor/Adreno 330 combo is one awesome setup! It makes apps like Minecraft, RipTide 2 and others look gorgeous and perform without hiccup. It's no small deal that the top of the line hardware can be had for bargain hunter prices.----------TURN IT ON:----------The power button is on the left back side. It does take a moment to figure this out when being used to a button on the top or side has been the norm for so long. It's not a big deal, but surprising after forgetting for the first time.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**I still find the button on back to be somewhat clumsy. Even though the other side has two recessed buttons for the volume, it doesn't stand out enough for me. I'm still flipping the device back and forth at night with little or no light. Even in the day time or with light, I have to make a concerted effort to determine which way is up and remember that the power button is on the left. With my other devices, I just feel for the button and push.-----------------------------DOWNLOAD PRIME VIDEOS:-----------------------------This is the main reason I purchased the 64 GB WiFi version. First, I could take videos with me when I had no internet connection, such as in a car. Second, when my kids want to watch videos, I can download their favorites so they won't be hogging the bandwidth at home!How does this work? Go to the videos, choose the desired video and an option to download will be there. My first attempt to download a Prime video, I chose Downtown Abbey Season 3, Episode 1, which was 1:06 hours long. I was given three options: Standard Definition, 720P HD and 1080 HD. I selected the 1080P HD option first.My internet is 10 Mb/s DSL download speeds. I made it to about 44% downloaded after about 50 minutes. Of course, I kept on checking out other features during the wait. While trying to start Flick Soccer, the device locked up on me. I was stuck. I held the power button for a good while and it rebooted.The HDX then successfully upgraded the system, something that failed after my initial setup. Yes, an update already (for the Mayday button!) When I looked to see if the video was there, it was not. I had to start all over again. It didn't save.This time, I chose 720P HD. It took about 19 minutes to download. I was previously able to view the 1080P video while it was downloading. It looked awesome. The 720P HD looked just about as good. Some action scenes, I could tell it was lower quality, but not that noticeable. This 1:06 hour 720P HD video file consumed 1.24 GBs of space.Next I tried the SD, or lowest quality option and downloaded Episode 2. This took 5 minutes and 44 seconds. The SD video file size for a 1:06 episode was 267MB. The video was a tad blurry, more choppy during action, and more noise, grain and artifacts. However, for standard definition, it was surprisingly passable. Download your young kid's videos in SD and save some space. They won't care, and even you may not.Finally, I retried the 1080P video with Episode 3. This time, it took 44 minutes 38 seconds to successfully download. The quality, as mentioned before, was excellent. The colors were vibrant, the video sharp and fluid. It took up 2.07GBs of space.Here is the rundown. About 1 hour video episode of Downtown Abbey. 10 Mb/s DSL download speed.SD = 5:44 minutes to download. 267MB. Quite decent quality.720P = 19:12 minutes to download. 1.24GB. Very good quality.1080P = 44:38 minutes to download. 2.07 GB. Excellent quality.For those who are new to the Amazon world, yes, you can download the Netflix app and watch those, too, minus the download for later option.**UPDATE 23 OCT 2013**:Yes, there are 3 quality settings for downloading Prime Videos. After digging around, I found a few more choices.After swiping down system menu in the Home screen, go to:Settings / Applications / VideosHere you will see individual settings for HD and SD downloads. It turns out HD has 3 quality settings and SD has 3 quality settings.  I chose to ask for each setting.Also, in this menu, you will find the option for Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 Audio. Because this increases the size of the video while streaming, it is turned OFF by default. I turned it on and it does make a noticeable difference with surround sound effect, both with speakers and headphones. The video you are watching will need to support this feature.In this Video settings, there is also the option to clear video search history.Another discovery with Prime Video downloads is that most videos do have a time limit for viewing offline. As long as you connect back online, it resets that time, so not a big deal in most cases. So far, I've noticed videos such as \"Under the Dome\" have a 48 hour limit offline before needing to reconnect. Other videos have a 30 day window. It seems as if some of the kids' videos had no such time limit for offline viewing.**UPDATE 2 DEC 2013**I am discovering that not all Prime videos can be downloaded. This seems to be true with a lot of newer Prime movies and some TV shows. I'm hoping it is a licensing issue and not a decision made by Amazon. If possible, please make ALL Prime videos downloadable!I also find the ability to browse videos to be tedious. Similar to Netflix, on the Kindle devices, Amazon pushes out choices to you in limited quantities. If your watching habits change on any given day, you will need to really dig into the menu choices to see all the viewing options out there. The menu choices overlap and can make browsing confusing, and a challenge to track what one has already browsed.In the Videos, in the side menu under \"Prime Instant Video\" there are three main choices:Top TV ShowsTop MoviesFor the KidsWhat tipped me off, is under \"For the Kids\" there are very few choices. I knew from my Roku device and from browsing from a web viewer, there had to be more choices for the kids.Regardless of which of the three main categories one chooses, each has a sub-menu found by tapping the little down arrow that is right of the category description, such as:MOVIES (Upper left hand corner once this choice has been selected)Top Movies, Prime (Right under, MOVIE, in smaller letters) and the arrow is just right of this.Each main category has sub-menu items, as noted before. But each sub-menu also has the same choices. These would be the same regardless of which main category one came from. Hence, this is where some confusion can come into play.What each sub-menu has, within each main Prime category, is an option called, \"Genres.\"  This is where one needs to go to find the rest of the Prime viewing choices. Unfortunately, there are even more sub-categories within each Genre choice. One will never find all the choices in one place for mass browsing.Are you confused? That is my point. Browsing could be less confusing and easier to navigate.For these two points within Prime Video, I'd knock off a half star. But since I can't, I'll leave my rating at 5 stars because overall, I'm still very happy with the device.----------AUDIO:----------I found the speakers to have decent sound. It sounds a tad more fuller than my Sony Xperia Tablet Z, but iPad 4 is still much better and sounds louder. The new HDX is sufficiently loud enough while holding it, but I do wish it could go a notch or two louder. With my Klipsch X10i head phones, the sound was plenty loud. It sounded better than the speakers and was OK. It won't win over Audiophiles, but good enough for entertainment purposes.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**In Settings/Device/Applications/Videos Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 Audio is shut off by default. Turn it on. It improves the sound, especially with the built in speakers. I can actually sense a better surround sound effect in videos that support this.I find that the speaker sound is actually pretty good the more I use it. There is more meat to the sound than I initially thought. For personal use, the loudness is good in a quiet environment. The sound quality is good for a tablet. The sound stage is narrow. The surround sound effect, once turned on is decent. The simulated surround effect is noticed most of the time.I still think the iPad 4 has the best built in speakers I've heard on a phone or tablet. I listened to the built in speakers on the new iPad Air, and the Kindle Fire HDX is much better. The iPad Air built in speakers takes a big step back compared to the iPad 4. The Air also has mono speakers and it really sounds mono, in a bad way.**UPDATE 2 DEC 2013**Rather than relying strictly on my memory, I went back and tested the audio side by side with my wife's iPad 4. I would say the sound quality is about the same. What I overlooked was the fact the iPad 4 only has one external speaker. It is mono. In that regards, I give the nod to the Kindle Fire HDX. With some surround effect, once turned on, the HDX separates itself even more. From my own testing, the built in speakers are one of the best on any tablet or phone. The more I use it this way, the more I am enjoying it. In most cases where disturbing others is not a concern, I don't feel compelled to need headphones. If one does need a little bit louder sound, hold it with both hands from the top, and the sound reflects directly to you, making it sound a little louder. The decision to put the speakers on top in landscape mode, was a very good one.----------GRAPHICS:----------The HDX has the latest and greatest Adreno graphics to compliment the current king of the hill quad-core Snapdragon 800 2.2GHz processor. Yes, it is a huge upgrade from the original Kindle. Huge!Playing the Temple Run games, I'd get frustrated with the lag on the original Kindle Fire. No more lag. Graphics look great. No video tearing.In Minecraft PE, the original Kindle can play it, but It's not a great experience. The HDX plays it with the best Androids out there. Once again, the beautiful screen and powerful graphics chip makes playing Minecraft a joy, even with Amazon's highly skinned version of Android running it.----------SCREEN:----------The screen is sharp. Texts are very crisp. Colors are accurate and beautiful. There are no pixels to be seen by my naked eye.One nice surprise is that the screen itself seems to be somewhat oliophobic. While fingerprints are there, they seem to disappear some. It is one of the better screens for this, at least that is my initial impression. I don't think this was even intended. I'll revisit this later with more time.The screen is glossy. It does reflect a lot. But once turned on, it can be noticeable, but also easily forgotten. If you are prone to glare and easily distracted by it, keep this in mind.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**After further use, I still think the Kindle Fire HDX screen is one of the best screens in terms of keeping it clean. It does collect finger oils, but I find it still keeps on cleaning off easier than any other device I've ever used. I don't even need a special cloth. Just by cleaning it off with the palm of my hands, the screen looks nearly clean again!----------MAYDAY:----------Yes, I tried it. I really had a question! No, really! I knew that while reading a book, the HDX could have its contrast adjusted for better reading in sunlight, as well as longer battery life. I looked everywhere how to get to this setting. I couldn't find it.I opened up the Mayday feature and waited about 30 seconds to connect. After confirming my email, address and name associated with my account, I was asked how they could help. With the speaker on full volume, I had a difficult time hearing the female tech, Celeste. I asked her my question and she did need to seek help to find the answer, but I got the answer. She was friendly. I could move the little window wherever I wanted. At one point, she took control of the screen.The answer was that the screen brightness setting had to be set to auto and it would then recognize when to make the adjustments while reading.It might seem a little daunting to do tech support via video conference. Don't worry. The video is one way. They don't ever see you. The tech can only see your screen.The Mayday button is added with the first initial system update, which should take place during the setup. But if it failed the first time like it did for me, you won't see it when swiping down for the settings on top of the screen. Manually update the Kindle by swiping down the top and finding it in the settings.I really don't see Mayday being a feature I'll need much, but it's a nice touch for the tech challenged.----------X-RAY:----------This could be one of the most underrated features. I didn't bat an eye about it before the purchase. Now, I think it is really useful and can see myself turning to it all the time.In movies, tap the video screen and X-Ray pops up on the left side. X-Ray detects which characters are in the current scene and you can find out more about the actor. Trivia facts are also there. It's like watching a DVD with narration on, only much less annoying and much smarter.In the Music player, X-Ray provides scrolling lyrics that follow the song as it goes. If you are a karaoke fan (I am not much so) then you will love this.Yes, even in some books, X-Ray is there. It provides footnote like data about characters and terms. I've only seen it in the book Les Miserable. There could be more. I'm guessing it depends on what the publisher provides.----------------SILK WEB BROWSER:----------------It's pretty fast for an Android tablet. On a tablet, I still find the Ipad 4 is the best experience with Safari. There is the option for mobile website, desktop version, or automatic. This is a bit misleading. I prefer desktop version of websites. However, with Silk, you won't get a real desktop experience. Silk still customizes the website to fit the HDX screen. The accuracy will depend on each website.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013***I find I don't use the Silk Browser much unless I need to quick look something up. I really wish the option to have a full desktop view did just that. On some of my sites, like Yahoo, it does a bad job of rendering pages. I may have to side load Chrome.---------------KINDLE FREETIME:---------------I just set up Kindle FreeTime. I did the Family Plan for up to 6 kid profiles for $6.99 a month. The other option is for one child for $2.99 a month.Once I set the age (but not actual birthdays, just close to their age) for each child, and subscribed to the unlimited family plan, I tried using it.It was a bit confusing at first. I wanted to set the content for each child. I couldn't find all these \"unlimited\" apps, books and videos for kids. I could only see what was already on my device or what I owned in the cloud.Only when I actually logged in as one of my kids, did I see all the kid's content I had subscribed. There were plenty of choices. The initial choices were for me to determine what I wanted my kids to be able to access that was for my main account. No, I don't want them to have access to all me and my wife's content. But yes, I do want them to have access to other apps and videos we already purchased. That was what the initial content filtering was all about.My first impression of Kindle FreeTime is that I may end up having to buy each kid their own Kindle. I can see them fighting over MY, I stress MY, Kindle HDX. I may never see it again once I let them on it. I think it's going to be that good. Thankfully, I can set time limits for them!**UPDATE 23 OCT 2013**:I could not download videos for offline use within FreeTime. That seems to be an Amazon Prime video benefit.Only certain books could be downloaded and viewed while offline.I did like that some books can be set to have a narrator read the books to the young child. This is good for my 3 year old. He loves the Thomas books that do this.------------BATTERY LIFE:------------The HDX came with about 60% charge. I'm making an educated guess since it was a graphic meter that is the default battery indicator. I changed it to show percentage after I'd used the Kindle for a short while. It had 54% by that time. After about 4.5 -5 hours of very heavy usage setting up, testing and downloading, I'm at the last 1%.After completely draining the battery to where it shut off by itself, here is what I've been able to measure for recharging with the standard 5 watt included charger, which does eat up 2 outlets on an older power strip:15% in 28:44 minutes30% in 1:00 hour40% in 1:22 hours50% in 1:42 hours60% in 2:03 hours70% in 2:21 hours90% in 3:05 hours95% in 3:15 hours100% in 3:34 hours Whew!Note: There is no indicator light to show charging status.**UPDATE 25 OCT 2013**:I let my kids use the new Kindle Fire HDX during a 4 hour trip to visit family. With some video, lots of multiplayer MineCraft use, it lasted from Noon to 9 PM with about 35% battery life left. It wasn't on all the time, but it was being used frequently.In a more detailed drain test, here are the results:5:41 Hours = 100% Brightness playing constant video (downloaded)9:28 Hours = 50% Brightness playing constant video (downloaded)During the 50% brightness test, it took 4:52 hours to drain down to 50% battery life. It took 4:36 minutes to drain from 50% down to 0% where it powered off on its own.50% brightness is still viewable even in a well lit room. However, I'd at least go 70%. In dimly lit areas with some light, 50% is plenty bright.The Kindle HDX is very efficient with power. It barely warms up and it never gets hot. The claimed rating of 11 hours with mixed use seems about right and that's using it constantly. With light to medium use, one could easily go a full day and likely two or three away from a power source.----------------------------HOW MUCH MEMORY SHOULD I GET:----------------------------The base model with 16GB memory is $229. To double that memory to 32GB costs another $40. Compared to Apple's memory upgrade practice, this is a cheap upgrade. To quadruple the base memory of 16GB to 64GB costs $80. This is the best value if you are going to upgrade the internal storage size. Here's why:$2.50 per GB to add 16GB storage to base model for a total of 32GB.$1.67 per GB to add 48GB storage to the base model for a total of 64GB.I got the 64GB model because I am a content lover. I love choice. I love freedom to use even when speedy internet is not available. I want to be able to download videos for my kids when travelling in the car. Even at home, I'd rather they view videos locally from a device so I don't have to fight bandwidth with them! Data these days can add up fast. 8 GB on original Kindle Fire was definitely not enough for me. The new HDX can't be upgraded later, so I did it now. 64 GB was the cheapest upgrade option per GB. Your reasons may vary, but maybe that will help you decide what's best for you just in case you haven't thought about a few of those points.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**If you want to save some money, the 32GB should be enough for most people. I consider myself a heavier user. I currently have about 17 episodes (most an hour episode) and 2 full length movies, all in 720P HD and I have 31.5GB space left. I haven't loaded my own videos yet, but that is something I plan on doing. I'm glad I got 64GB.For those of you that don't care about storing large files on the Kindle device, the 16GB should suffice. If you change your mind down the road, you'll need to buy a whole new device, so be sure of what you want. I will say that I'm glad 8GB option is gone. That just didn't cut it.If you are buying for kids, 16GB could be enough. Download videos in SD and it will save a lot of space and still be decent viewing quality. Also, with some diligence, simply delete content you've watched and you'll get that space back. If you can live without the convenience and willing to work at it a bit, 16GB is still a good choice. For kid use with SD video, the 32GB option will give you ample room for the convenience factor.-----------------------------------SPECIAL OFFERS OR NO SPECIAL OFFERS:-----------------------------------I opted to keep the special offers. Why? Because, they don't bother anyone. You'll only see them from time to time on the screen lock when you first turn the HDX on. Special Offers don't show up at any other time when you are using the device. If you like Gold Box deals, supposedly, some of these offers can be exclusive and even better deals. Why not? I'll save $15 for that. I think people make way too big a fuss over this. Spend that money on some apps, songs or other content. The fun you'll get from that will far outweigh the seeing a few ads that barely intrude on your life.----------PORTS:----------I have noticed that plugging in both the head phone jack and the micro-USB port requires going in at a slight angle. The angle matches the angled edges of the Kindle HDX. Don't force it in straight on! Be gentle at first until you get the feel of it.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013***After almost a month and a half, I find the micro-USB power port to remain a tight and secure fit. It's one of the most secure feeling connections I've felt for a micro-USB device. We'll see how it holds up after more time.----------------------KINDLE ONLY EXCLUSIVES:----------------------Try watching Amazon Prime videos from an Android device post ICS. Google doesn't support Adobe Flash in Android any more. I find it frustrating. I can watch Amazon Prime videos from my Kindle devices.I am one that does like to listen to my books while driving. You can't do this from the Kindle app on other Android devices. Text to speech only works on actual Kindle devices. I'm not sure if the text to speech voice changed with the Mojito OS, but I like the new voice better. It is still mechanical, but much better. My only gripe is that the text to speech shuts off if you manually turn a page and when screen rotates. Please change this! Let text to speech stop when I choose to stop it, especially when driving in a car.====================PARTING THOUGHTS====================The Kindle 7\" HDX is meant for consumption of content for Amazon lovers. It excels at this in almost every way, from hardware to software. If you love Amazon, absolutely get it. Navigating Amazon's skinned Android is simple and easy to use, but not meant for the tinkerer. It's definitely not Apple in design. But, it is functional. It knows what it is and the latest Kindle Fire HDX, to me, is even more exciting than the original. The improvements are that good.====================PROS & CONS====================PROS:o Top of the line hardware, super fast and responsiveo Gorgeous screen for both resolution and coloro Screen handles fingerprints very wello Lightweight and easy to holdo Download Prime Videoso Long battery lifeo Crisp text for readingo Great price for the hardwareo Kindle FreeTime for the kidso Parental controlso X-Ray provides useful information for video, music and bookso Kindle exclusive featureso Mayday offers free support and helpCONS:o Back power and volume buttons need getting used too Speakers sound OK, but could be a little loudero Text to speech in books stops with screen rotation or manual turn of pageo No rear camerao No HDMI out porto No GPSo No Google Play", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Blue/purple border on white pages!", "Author": "LindaFus \"lindafus\"", "ReviewID": "RXJ3VD36FN0O2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased my Kindle Fire HDX from Best Buy. After trying to read a book, I noticed a pretty bright blue/purple streak that never went away on the sides of the pages. Going into Sepia and changing the background pages did not help this issue.  I called Amazon and they replaced it with a new one. The new one has the same blue/purple border on white and light background pages. The Amazon replacement is more subtle and even around the edges, so I opted to return the one that had the darker boarder.I now see on Amazon's  description of the Kindle Fire HDX that they actually mention this defect as being normal and I quote below:----------------We want you to know...\"The Kindle Fire HDX 7\" has perfect color accuracy (100% sRGB), and we wanted to share more details around our display design decisions that helped us achieve this.You may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. All displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy. Most LCD displays use white LEDs, and then apply filters to extract the desired color. The result is oftentimes a compromise to tone and color accuracy, or--if attempting to address these compromises--an increase in battery consumption and, thus, device weight.We've taken a different approach. To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7\" at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20% improvement in power efficiency.\"---------------This glow is not light nor is it narrow.  The text of a book runs through this and it is very uncomfortable to read this way. This is also true for the Silk Web browser.  I will keep my Kindle Fire for a bit and see how this all pans out with Amazon.  Buyer beware:  Reading with this blue/purple glow is not the same as it is on your Kindle HD or older.After stating the above, I will say, other than this serious screen flaw, this device runs everything else flawlessly and I love streaming movies on this device. Netflix runs great as does Amazon Prime movies. Apps load instantly and web pages as well. This screen issue not so much. I am a bit confused as to why Amazon thinks this blue/purple haze is ok.  I will try to get used to it.", "Date": "October 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Most amazing device I've ever owned!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1NFRVWEUS01UH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm 64 years of age and a teacher. I am no techie, but really enjoy the electronic gadgets that are being invented these days. I preordered and purchased the very first generation Kindle 2 years ago and felt that it was time for an upgrade. This time, I waited a couple of days to see how it was received by the public and to catch a few of the early reviews before deciding to order. I'm sorry I waited. This tablet is AMAZING for my purposes! It is designed for media consumption and anyone who purchase it ought to be aware of it. It does a great job in that aspect.The \"purple haze\" a number of reviewers have complained about seems quite inobtrusive to me. I don't know that if I were not previously aware it would even be in the discussion. It is a very faint, but discernible border around thedevice when reading.  I haven't found it to be annoying at all and shouldn't be a deal-breaker.I use the device for reading of books and magazines, watching movies and television shows, playing games, e-mail and light surfing of the web. I'm even able to download my students' grades and attendance records from the school web site more rapidly than my hardwired computer in my workplace! The screen picture is more than outstanding...it is unbelievable! The keyboard appears when it is supposed to and is very responsive, just like the rest of the touch screen. And lest I forget the Mayday button, this whole concept is unreal, when I consider the time spent with most customer service outfits on the phone line waiting for my cal to be answered. Great job, AmazonDownloads of movies and games are quick. I have installed Netflix and Hulu Plus on the device and they work flawlessly with the device. As a Prime member as well, it works seamlessly. My digital subscriptions to several magazines were a snap to transfer to this device. All in all, my expectations were far exceeded by the product.The device is lightweight, beautiful and so cool I purchased an inexpensive ($4.95) case on line from Poetic that provides a lightweight shell and keeps the sleekness of the device intact, yet still allows me to prop it up for video viewing. It also puts the device in sleep mode when the cover is closed and the device immediately awakes when the cover is opened.While I understand the criticism, why buy the device if you knew it's limitations? It is the best at what it is supposed to do and the price when compared to other tablets on the market is a steal, if you consider what it is able to do (and not what it WASN'T supposed to do.In summation, if you are not a techie and just like to relax with a movie, read a book or magazine or play a game, start ordering your HDX now. Media doesn't have to cost you a fortune, is thousand of books I have ordered over the years have been free, and for a couple of hundred dollars a year I and my wife get all the video we want for all our devices from Prime, Netflix and Hulu +. It's the best toy I ever bought. Final rating: 9 out 0f 5!!!!!", "Date": "November 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best 7\" tablet on the market?", "Author": "J. Chambers", "ReviewID": "R3N1QB8TWW0WRJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "NOTE: This review is for the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" tablet with 32GB, special offers, and Wi-Fi only.I pre-ordered both the original Kindle Fire and the Kindle Fire HD 7\" tablets when they were first announced. It was love at first swipe. The second generation HD was a huge advance over the first generation, with the welcomed addition of an external volume control, an HDMI port, and higher screen resolution. The HDX is also a big step-up from its predecessor. The most obvious improvements:* Higher resolution - 1920x1200 (323 ppi) in the HDX versus 1280x800 (216 ppi) in the HD. That's a huge difference, especially when viewing HD videos. The HDX has a new graphics processor that Amazon says has 4X the performance of the HD.* Faster processor - a 2.2GHz quad-core Snapdragon processor in the HDX versus 1.5GHz dual-core processor in the HD. This is really advanced hardware for a tablet, putting the HDX at the high-performance end of the tablet market. Also, the HDX has 2GB of RAM, compared to the HD's 1GB.* Longer battery life - 11 hours (up to 17 hours in a \"reading mode\") for the HDX versus 10 hours for the HD.* Lighter weight - 10.7 ounces for the HDX versus 13.9 ounces for the HD. That's a noticeable difference when you're hand-holding the Fire. The weight reduction comes from a magnesium body covered with a rubbery material that's easy to grip. The shape is different, too, with beveled edges that help with hand-holding the HDX, since your fingers curl around it better. Also, the speakers have been moved from their position in the HD to the top of the beveled section (in the landscape orientation). This is a nice improvement from the HD, since your fingers won't cover the speakers in the HDX. And speaking of audio, X-Ray lyrics for my downloaded songs is a really cool feature. Really cool.* I like the new display. The display on the HD was the carousel filling most of the home page. This is still the default on the HDX, but swiping upward fills the screen with apps instead.* The power button and volume control have been moved. I hated the ones on the HD. They were hard to see and hard to find by feel. On the HDX, the concave buttons are on either side of the tablet when it's held in landscape position. It's not perfect, but I like it better.Those improvements alone make the HDX worth upgrading from the HD in my opinion. My biggest frustration with the HD was how the Silk browser was unresponsive sometimes, sitting there while I tapped a link several times. Occasionally, rebooting got the browser back on track, but it was frustrating. I've been using the HDX's browser for several hours, and it's been very smooth and responsive so far.I've already noticed a lot of fairly minor changes from the HD. For one, they've tweaked the virtual keyboard a bit. The most obvious change was to kill the long-press apostrophe from the period key. Now the apostrophe is on the numerical keyboard. It's not a big deal, it just takes some getting used to. Also, from some of the first reviews of the HDX that I read, some users are complaining about a purple border around web pages. To be honest, I barely noticed it. It's a very light purple about a tenth of an inch wide on my HDX. I don't know why it's there, but it doesn't bother me.Amazon will now allow some Prime Instant Video movies and TV shows to be downloaded onto the HDX and viewed later. I haven't tried this yet (and I don't know how you identify these videos if this feature is active), but it may be a good enough reason to go with the 32GB or 64GB versions of the HDX if you watch a lot of videos and aren't always connected to Wi-Fi. By the way, the HDX's memory is in a single partition where you can store anything, including books/audio books/magazines, apps, music, and videos. With my 32GB version of the HDX, about 25GB was free when I got the device.The most innovative new feature in the HDX is the \"Mayday\" button. Amazon says this will connect you with a real person who can in real-time walk you through a problem. (You must have an active internet connection to do this.) I just had to try it, so I did. \"Katie\" came online in just a few seconds, and after verifying my name, home address, and email address, she helped me with a couple of questions I had. That's remarkable customer service.As good as it is, though, the HDX isn't perfect. Here are my biggest disappointments:* They took the HDMI port away. Granted, with Prime streaming videos and our Roku box, I didn't use it often, but I wish it was still there. Amazon has announced that there's a software update coming that will let you send video through a PlayStation 3 or to certain Samsung TVs, but I don't have either of those.* There's still no GPS in the Wi-Fi HDX, although unless you have the 4G model (which includes GPS), it doesn't matter so much. In any case, you can still use apps like MapQuest for trip planning.* No speech recognition. I really hate this. Without this feature, there won't be any cool apps like Apple's Siri or Android's Speaktoit Assistant. Actually, you can install Speaktoit Assistant from the Amazon appstore, but you have to type in commands instead of speaking them. (Note: I read somewhere that it's possible to download Google Voice Search from the Google Play store, enabling speech recognition on the Kindle Fire.) There is a microphone, though, so you can use voice recorder apps and music recognition apps like Shazam and SoundHound.But despite a few disappointments, I'm generally very pleased with the HDX. It's a superb tablet. Although the Amazon appstore is still dwarfed by Google Play, Amazon's vast media library of books and magazines, videos, and music more than makes up for fewer apps, at least for me. The very smooth Silk web browser is greatly improved, and setting up email accounts and using email is very easy.I haven't bought a cover for the HDX, although I'm sure I will, since my old HD case won't fit the HDX. Amazon has its \"Origami\" case, and other companies are already advertising their HDX cases, but I'll wait a month or two and see what all is out there before buying one. Fortunately, the HDX's size is close enough to the HD's that the padded sleeve I got for the HD is big enough for the HDX.And a pleasant surprise: Kindles always ship with a USB charging cable, but I was surprised to see a wall charger in the box too.Bottom line: I really like the HDX, and for me it was worth the upgrade from my year-old HD.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not Worth the Aggravation of the Connection Problems", "Author": "Wayne \"wyadams\"", "ReviewID": "R31UC33XHKN8MS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It seems that Amazon is aware that the Kindle Fire has problems connecting and staying connected to wireless networks, and has chosen to ignore the problem and continue to sell this piece of garbage.

It disconnects from our network at random times, and at other times will not connect at all, sometimes for an entire day. At the same time this is happening, I am sitting next to her using my Motorola Xoom which has a good strong (four bars), stable connection, so it is not a network problem, it is a device problem. In fact no other wireless device on our network has EVER had connection problems.My recommendation is to find some other HD tablet and wait for Amazon to get the message that they can't foist this kind of garbage on the public and expect us to buy it.In addition, though the display and sound are excellent, there is not enough difference between the Fire and other HD tablets to make it worth the aggravation and hours of dead time.

I'm going to give my first impressions of this great device and will probably add to this review in the coming weeks.First off, please do your research before you buy a tablet of any kind. If you like Apple products, by all means, fork over the extra $100 plus and get an iPad mini. If you don't like a device, don't waste time trashing it just because it's not your preference. If you are looking for a blazing fast, easy to use, easy to fall in love with device - look no further than the Kindle Fire HDX  :-)I purchased this as an upgrade to my gen 2 Kindle Fire mainly because I wanted to use Bluetooth speakers. Once I started reading about all of other upgrades, I couldn't wait to pre order this one. Here are a few of the improvements I have noticed so far.It's sooo much lighter than the older KF! I have some issues with my grip, thumb dexterity etc and this new Kindle is so much easier to carry and hold while reading. My new Kindle has 4x the storage and is about 4 ounces lighter - it may not seem like much difference, but it is!The web browser is greatly improved over older Silk versions. I had sideloaded Dolphin on my older KF, just because it worked so much better than Silk. I still put Dolphin on this one, but don't use it nearly as much - mainly for those sites that rely on Flash.HDX display is awesome!! I thought my older KF had a great display but this new one is so gorgeous. I never had an original HD Kindle, so I can't compare that, but X must be better, right?? :-)  I like the Houzz app and the pictures are so clear, you feel like you could walk into the rooms. I enjoy watching older TV shows on my Kindle and even those old black and white programs look better on this screen.Reading is such a pleasure on this device. The lighter weight and sharp display are great for books. I read about 5 books a week, both print and digital, and I think I will be reading more on my Kindle than before. I started to time the download speed for a book, but it was so quick I didn't have time to start my stopwatch. It was a shorter book (about 200 pages), but talk about fast!The quad core processor is very, very fast. I don't have the fastest home wi-fi and my other devices sometimes get hung up while trying to download or play videos. The KF HDX has had no problem at all. I have streamed Netflix, Amazon Video and used the Watch ABC app with no trouble at all. I have the wi fi hotspot feature on my  phone and this Kindle connected fine and was still fast on that connection.This device responds so quickly, it's scary.The camera is nice, but I don't really use it much. I did take a picture of my cat and it looked great :-). If you Skype or video chat, I am certain that it will meet your needs.I read one reviewer's statement that they miss having GPS on the new KF. I very rarely used it on my older KF and don't miss it on this one at all. I have Google Maps and Navigation on my phone if I need directions. I figure we get tracked enough already, so no biggie for me.The speakers are great, of course. I'm not a big music critic and generally an AM/FM radio is enough for me. My husband is a big music lover and he gave his approval to the sound, so I know they must be good :-).  I use a bluetooth speaker when I watch movies or TV, but even without a speaker you won't have any trouble with the sound on here.Amazon Appstore vs Google Play - some people have very strong feelings about the app choice on Amazon and I do have a couple of apps that I sideloaded (Dolphin and Olive Tree Bible). I have an Android phone so I know that Google may have more choice than Amazon, but I don't think it's a deal breaker. It's very easy to sideload apps, just search online. I prefer Amazon even on my phone. Again, it's a matter of doing your research and making an informed decision.I am very pleased with my new Kindle.

In the weeks I've had the tablet, the speed has been great, for the device.Now to caveat that, the apps are where this tablet falls short.  I would say a good 30% of the time, an app will just crash and need to have the process stopped in Apps Manager and then restarted.  Furthermore, the apps store when compared to Apple/Play Store supplied with an iPad or Google tablet are very lacking.  Half the apps I've had in the past I cannot even find, or they have yet to be updated for the Kindle store.*Display & Sound*The screen is literally crystal clear, and with its true HD 1080p (1920x1200 323ppi) display the HD movies I watch are actually HD and look fantastic.The sound system with virtual 5.1 surround sound I will say isn't all it is chalked up to be.  The volume controls are rather annoying to be completely honest.  One click up or down is a drastic change in volume, the sort to where one click is too loud and then the next is too quiet.  I use my Klipsch headphones with my Kindle, so for me this isn't an issue.  I did feel like it should be mentioned to potential buyers though.*Build & Battery*I love the design of the Kindle Fire HDX, the buttons being placed on the back make it very smooth looking.  I have accidentally hit the sleep button once or twice, but this isn't a design flaw to me, so merits no penalty.The battery life I'd say is the biggest hitter in this review.  Amazon boasts an impressive 11 hour mixed use (could mean a lot of things) and 17 hours while only reading.  I cannot attest to the honesty of the ladder boast, because I haven't ONLY used my tablet for 17 hours of reading and not without charging every couple days.  The former however, I can say that 11 hours is a stretch.  Maybe \"mixed use\" means reading a book and watching a film on a long international flight with no internet connection?  I could see 11 hours for that, possibly.  I consider \"mixed use\" to mean, use of the internet, and while running apps and music.  With this I can say I've had my tablet die from between 5-8 hours, very far from 11.  I've come to the point where an extra battery pack is likely to be a early next year purchase.*NOTES*Amazon \"Mayday\" service is brilliant; I had to use it three times in the first week.  Every call was answered within 15 seconds (as they boast) and the technicians were helpful enough with taking over the tablet and doing the work for me.  I'm sure as with all customer service, they start with reading off a script, but in the end they fixed my issues and I was very satisfied with the help and automatic availability of a technician.I do not have the \"blue edge\" or \"yellow tones\" so many other reviewers have stated.  So I am not sure if this was fixed with a model update or I just got lucky.  Either way it doesn't exist, so I can't complain.*Price & Recommendation*The price is more than realistic for this device, and better yet, worth the investment.Whether you're looking to get your first tablet, or looking to get an upgrade, this is likely for you.  I am happy with the new Kindle Fire HDX and besides the apps malfunctions and seemingly shortened battery life, it was a good purchase.The Kindle Fire HDX is a firm \"yes\" from this reviewer and my final recommendation would be not to read too many low reviews, because most the time they are by angry people that expect perfection out of the box.  If you get a malfunctioning device, return it and get a new one.  Just because the one was bad, DOES NOT mean that the tablet itself isn't worth getting.", "Date": "December 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Now Great For Web Browsing!

Each of them has been good for videos, books, and music.  And this device does better than ever before in each of those categories:  the screen is sharper, the unit is lighter, and the battery lasts longer.But what is really impressive to me is how much the web browsing experience has improved.  I became frustrated with previous Kindle Fire models when trying to browse.  This version fixes that.  The web performance is quite good, even with multiple tabs open to non-mobile-optimized pages.I also really like the new \"mirror your screen\" functionality.  I have used this component to interface with a non-Miracast TV that has an open HDMI port:  NETGEAR Push2TV Wireless Display AdapterIt works as advertised (which means really, really well).  Does not seem to drop any frames, even when watching a high-def movie, or when playing games.Finally, the Mayday feature is very slick.  I used this feature to ask an agent which Miracast-HDMI interface to get.  They said on the Mayday call that any of them would work, and they don't have a specific recommendation.  If I have any future questions about the device, I will not hesitate to use the Mayday feature.All in all, it is amazing to me that you can buy a quad core, high def, touch screen tablet like this for $229.

I opine Amazon's OS for the Kindle Fire HDX barely scratches the surface of the underlying Android Jelly-Bean possibilities (and I purchased the 64GB version to get around the lack of expandability, and plan to keep app installing minimal for this). So, here I am clarifying that my high rating centers around how well this device is serving my intended purposes as a 7-inch Amazon-app-in-tablet-form (heheh).I could tell from reading Amazon's product description that far from all the Amazon Prime videos would be available for download (due to licensing)--still, I imagined I'd likely find enough to entertain overnight during necessarily increasingly frequent visits to shut-in tech-phobic relatives. So I was pleasantly surprised to find a greater number and variety of downloadable vids than I had expected.So far, I am relieved to read most of the negative reviews concern the number of downloads available (versus other folks' expectations and/or needs) and/or complain about the blue/purple haze/glow around the display edge--that my eyes saw instead as a faint yellowish page background within a brighter border. The tinge isn't distracting to me, but I can imagine others being bothered--one person's OK is another's annoyance.The wall adapter and usb-to-micro-usb cord that came with mine work OK now, but the coating on the cord feels stiff, like it might get brittle and crack off sooner or later (I hope later, if it must), so I'll wait and see. Another adapter and cord (bought from an AT&T; Store) that I use for an older android tablet works fine with this, of course.So far, wifi connecting and re-connecting have worked trouble-free on my device. The Netflix app has worked OK for me, too, but I didn't plan on using this for that service (much).The Mayday \"buton\" brought help almost instantly, but I realized after a few moments of chat I was seeking and not finding a feature included with Paperwhite, not this (oops). Anyway, I hereby report I tried Mayday and it worked--as advertised, a friendly talking face appeared quickly in the lower right and even demonstrated jotting on the screen to point out stuff.HMMM: When the tablet is in the magnetic case and I have the creased case-cover folded back flat behind the screen, the display will very occasionally turn off suddenly, I've noticed, especially when I'm shifting my grip awkwardly or changing the orientation back and forth indecisively--but moving the cover again slightly or tapping the power button brings the (special offer) lock-screen back...and so it goes...a weirdness.UPDATE: The seemingly random occasional display shutoff/sleeping (despite setting the display to stay on an hour) appears to happen ONLY when I hold the side AND then happen to cover over (with my thumb) a spot next to the camera. Since I quit doing that, it stopped going dark suddenly and unpredictably (before the shutoff period was up)...So...still weird, but whatever.HMMM, again: I've locked the thing up twice, so far, probably by switching rapidly among menus/apps/this&that; impatiently while learning what's where: once it restarted (maybe rebooted?) spontaneously and once I restarted it (not rebooted). This hasn't happened again, since I've calmed down--I suspect that app interactions, electronic \"traffic jamming\" and Android-quirkiness unavoidably multi-cause this freezing/shutting-down every now and then. If it were happening often, I would suppose I'd received a defective unit, but that doesn't seem to be the case here, because it's happened only twice, thus far. At least once/day I do turn this off, on purpose, BTW, because I've discovered my other Androids function better ongoingly when I do.Mainly I bought this to serve as a mini-entertainment center, to combine with noise-cancelling headphones and help me down-out loud voices and blaring noises within wifi-deprived venues I must visit more and more for who knows how long. My smartphone can provide wifi for my ultrabook for shorter periods (to minimize too-expensive wireless data use) when it turns out I need Internet access though a larger screen during these jaunts.UPDATE--MAYBE WORTH MENTIONING--because it could annoy some folks seriously: Menus and settings are super-sparse compared to my other (closer to stock) Android devices. Also, the back arrow doesn't take me to the app I was just using--I must go home first. Maybe there are compatible apps to fill in the blanks (switching between apps or customizing more settings)--but I haven't looked for any yet because I am finding the simplicity refreshing, so far.Anyway, I may revise or add on later, but just now I can report I'm pretty pleased overall. I don't feel like subtracting a star for anything I've mentioned so far--which all seems to me (based on experience and research) rather typical for tablets, usb cords and wall adapters in general, but which I realize could be deal-breakers for others with different needs, purposes and standards.", "Date": "October 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "my brand new Kindle Fire HDX 7, didn't work.

I am convinced it caused my first Kindle Fire HDX to lose its ability to start up.  I attempted to side-load my music again to the new replacement tablet and it almost stopped responding as well.  Your mileage may vary, but be extremely careful if you need to side-load anything to your Kindle using the Android Transfer App.* There is currently no way to easily download all of your music from the Amazon Cloud, which led me to the previous bullet point- - - - - - -The biggest issue I have observed is bringing your music from your Amazon cloud down to the device.  It is a slow process.  This led me to attempt side-loading, but the support for side-loading is subpar.  I have not had a good experience in downloading my music, nor with using Google's Android Transfer App.  Amazon should step-up their support in these aspects.Overall, this tablet meets my needs and I enjoy using it.  The sound is superb, which makes it a great music device once your music is actually on the device.  The cloud streaming is also excellent.  If you will always have access to wifi, then you may have no need of downloading your music and media.You cannot find a better value in a tablet than a Kindle Fire.

I also have a paperwhite and the outgoing HD (also 7\"). I loved the old HD, but it had one fatal flaw: the inability to highlight across pages. Other than that problem it was beautiful to hold, if a little heavy; good to look at if there isn't back light. Many have complained about the near invisibility of the on/off switch and volume knobs on the outgoing model. I say, \"true, but at least they're out of the way.\"  In the new model you run into them much more frequently, it's not terrible, but more of an issue than on the outgoing model.So how about the other elements I mentioned. First, the hdx fixes the problem of highlighting across pages--as does the new hd. The text quality is improved with higher dpi, and that helps with readability. However the new sharp angles, and more critically the dramatically embossed amazon on the back makes actually holding the the thing unpleasant, the old hd was smooth across the back.The blue fringe problem is an issue. It's less of a problem as you increase brightness, but at low brightness level it does impinge on the text.Weirdnesses: the usb and phone ports are at odd angles to the body that makes using them awkward.(Edit: Whatever problem Amazon was having with Adobe Reader now is fixed: This paragraph no longer is true) PDF handling. The default pdf reader remains useless for academic work. On the old Kindle HD you could load for free the Adobe Reader which was a very high quality app. On the new HDX the situation is harder. You need to (1) side load Adobe Reader and--this is new--(2) launch Adobe Reader through ES File Explorer! The machine refuses to create an icon on home/carousel. You can run it, but not easily.It's slightly lighter than the old HD, but still not as good as the paperwhite; the screen is just as reflective as the old model; so if you work in bright lights, you'll still want to get an e-paper reader rather than this.Finally, compared to the HD and the paperwhite this is just unstable. I had 2 crashes (leading to a reboot) from the kindle reader (just changing pages!). I'm hoping the soon-to-be release helps with this.I appreciate many of the features of the new machine, but Amazon giveth and taketh away.

I'm posting this as 4-stars, minus one star for reasons I'll explain below. Some of my points will be comparing it to the original Fire.First up, it is noticeably lighter than the original Fire, and the beveled edges make it a bit easier to hold. There is a bizarrely angled port for the power charger, in that it does not sit flush with the Fire, and you kinda have to keep this in mind when plugging it in. I am mildly concerned that the power cable will experience stress, especially in a situation when I am using it while charging it. It just seems like a weird thing.Setting it up was pretty easy, just a few steps, log in to your Amazon account, and it automatically populates the carousel with my recently read books, in the proper order. I used the Silk browser for a while, and it is very nice; it is a full blown browser, not the \"mobile\" browser that I've seen on various Android devices. Pinch-n-zoom, slide-n-scroll, all the navigation people are probably already familiar with. If not, it doesn't take long to get used to it.I did look at some prior reviews just now, and see a lot of people mention the \"purple haze\", and unfortunately for me, now that I've read about it, I see the same effect on my HDX. It is mostly apparent in certain lighting situations, such as the reading books, when the screen is mostly white. I watched several hours of anime and did not notice anything at the time. It does not seem to be apparent on the home screen or a few other places, which makes me wonder if this is just a possible software fix.Battery life seems pretty good. When I first got it out of the box, it was at 60% charge, and it did not take very long to top it off. I did not time anything, so I can only offer subjective impressions. I watched at least 18 25-minute videos before I felt the battery was depleted enough to need a recharge, but it was not less than 25%, and I could have squeaked more non-video usage out of it.Speaking of video, this new HDX has the option to download Prime videos. I mean, you can watch them for free via Prime, but to actually download them? That's a new thing on me. I ended up downloading 14 episodes, one right after the other. Those videos take up a bit under 2gb of memory. Seems pretty good.Edit: I forgot to mention that the speakers are very nice compared to the original Fire. While using the first-gen Fire to watch videos, one of the first things I felt I needed was a set of external speakers. Once you start adding external accessories to a supposedly portable device, well, you kinda lose something in that process. The HDX speakers are very nice, crisp and loud enough that I don't feel the need for external speakers.The video app is very fickle for me. I selected the series I wanted to watch, which was an anime with 25 episodes. After watching two in a row, I need to take a break, so I put the HDX down on the table and come back in an hour or so. Restarting the HDX shows the series on the carousal, but when I click on the icon, it gives me a spinning cursor icon and waits forever, and never actually loads the video list. I timed 10 minutes on this behavior once. I've tried disconnecting/reconnecting to wi-fi, rebooting, etc, and can't determine why this happens. And it _only_ happens with the video app. Everything else is snappy as I could hope. I know it is not my WiFi, which is a dual-band BG/N router. Connecting at N speeds, I get 75% signal strength. Dropping down to BG speeds gives me full strength. But either way, signal strength is strong enough, and everything else works as expected, so that I know it is not latency that causes this. It is something with the way Amazon remembers where I stopped off, caching my last viewed video and position in the video. Even going into the previously downloaded content exhibits this behavior.Edit: if I force-kill the Amazon Video app, this behavior is no longer apparent, so I still feel confident in my suspicion that it is something software-wise, or something with Amazon's services, and unrelated to user error.So long story short, I find it is a minor flawed upgrade, but one still worth perusing.", "Date": "October 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Upgrade from the HD", "Author": "Willy Wailer", "ReviewID": "RMP1TPKL887RJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my 6th Kindle and my third Fire having started with the original.

I knew going in that I would be using this device for entertainment and for really quick access to weather apps, email and eCommerce sites.  The screen looks amazing and the sound is awesome.  The biggest negative I have is that you can't use flash player.  That's not Amazon's fault or oversight, that's just the Android incompatibility.  I don't need this particular functionality with most of the streaming content I wish to view.  But if that is a deal breaker for you, then just take that into account.  Otherwise, I am very happy with my purchase.", "Date": "April 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Product For Right Consumer", "Author": "Katt Winter", "ReviewID": "R192TZ8FIH9EP0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am a techie, and an Amazon Prime lover. I own a Note 3, MSI GT70, Ipad4, Note 10.1 2014, and a few older tablets for reading including an underwhelming 2012 HD refurbished Kindle. I was annoyed with the old HD for many reasons and was going to return it until my son stole it for Kindle Free Time, which btw, is worth the subscription. However, as many people do who don't have multiple screen homes (Kindle HD 2012 was first and only at the time) I was annoyed by its limits and didn't see it's merits.Even with my plethora of fancy and infancy devices I missed Amazon's set up for books and video streaming. I could have got the all new version of the HD cheaply but I thought for a few dollars more having the most recent Kindle would've hurt, would have all the product support (os updates, lending library, and Prime HD streams). However, what I didn't know about was the free Prime downloads they added!!!!!Unfortunately this feature will only be amazingly useful on Kindle with higher memory. It makes me want to cry. :( If you want to store your music and have up to four or so 1080p movies downloaded for offline use 16 gigs is too small. It's the case for any tablet, and to be honest 32 is really very little. The os your apps and games will eat that space in no time. It's not like the olden days.Aside from the os eating all my space, I have to say if you're a Prime Member the HDX is a need. It's so lovely watching videos for free that were optimized for your device in impressive full 1080p. I had no idea how useful this would be for more than a bedside companion. No 4G or purchases necessary to enjoy a show while you're waiting at the doctor. In that respect alone, if you're a loyal Amazon subscriber regardless of the tablet this is a no brained thing you will enjoy.The old HD lags and is slow, but this model is fast. You can write accurately and with ease. The battery life might make you sad, but if you're reading I believe you have 17 hours. Which, is totally why you own a fire right? ;)The app store is still limited, and behind ios and android in updates and releases, but Amazon is working on getting exclusive games for its tablet owners like the Telltale Walking Dead series. Which is amazing...I'm pregnant and struggling with a lot of physical issues and have been confined to my bed so gadgets have become very important. I doubt I could rationalize spending $300 of tech money on an 8.9 or even a 7 inch HDX when for that I could purchase a Nexus 10 or 7, or even a used retina ipad mini, but I can't say I don't want one. (There is one on my wishlist).If you're new to technology and tablets you will love an HDX, if you're a loyal Amazon Prime fan and use their wonderful services then you will enjoy this. It's fast. So fast, and streams in true HD with proper broadband connection so you will only miss the downloads when you're mobile. We all know Kindle Ebooks beat all other ebooks, and Amazon makes the best reading app. It's still an impressive ereader, and the Goodreads integration makes my nerdy soul happy.Cons are it's still a bit heavy for a reader, but a nice case with a strap should remedy that. No back camera, so if this is going to be your main tablet you will be saddened. No HDMI port but those are becoming dinosaur tech, and adapters or Miracast exists now for older tv's. No Google Play store... But I have to say something as a techie dork. Amazon I hope you're listening, you guys almost have it right. What do I mean?You're providing great hardware for discounted prices and adding amazing customer service to your product for no additional cost. *Slow Clap* You're producing Amazon Exclusive content that is available only on your devices, but you allow other devices access to your main features so you're not self isolating either like Apple can.The HDX is truly a step in the right direction of you guys can do the following:Open The Play Store. Trust your products and store, it's great. Apps are discounted, and fair. Limiting yourself in this area is hurting you. I believe you'll see the errors of your ways here. Have exclusive content and offer your own, and win the internet even more than you already have.Step the prices down for the bigger memory tablets. You're not selling machines, you're selling a portal to one of the best services out there. I save so much money using your physical stores alone!! Your videos are beautifully optimized. Your tablets are now impressive, and no one can best your customer service for the services you provide. So, since you're selling physical products, movies, and exclusive content take a bit more of a hit on them HDX tablets so the service is available to more people everywhere.Allow us to customize the carousel. We know it's a Kindle, but give us some options. Let us display a book collection up there instead of all the recently opened things. Remove from carousel is one of my least favorite things. I don't mind the special offers, because there are great deals and recommendations there but allow us some level of customization and I don't mean those weird decals.Let Google into your hearts all the way. Give us a normal page or two with widgets. I love the folders feature.If you made those tweaks your tablet might win the internet completely. (Maybe usb 3.0 too)That all being said this is a great tablet for Prime members, readers, and streamers. The 16 gig HDX is worth keeping around for a long time, and I believe newbies and tech lovers alike will be happy with the hardware.If this is your only tab expect app store limits and some frustrations, but Amazon is really working to improve those things, and HDX owners will reap the benefits of this in the future. Music sounds great for back speakers and is the best I've heard from any non Bluetooth connected tablet yet. Price is still good. May Day is useful for even the savviest of us because it saves time. If you're not going to be a Prime Member, you want the biggest selection of apps and all of their updates immediately and this is going to be your main and only device... you're not a reader... or you're looking for a productivity or Jack of all trades machine this isn't for you. Don't buy it then give it a horrible review. This is a media tab. Movies, music, books, and shopping. All the best things in life. It does do some productivity but if that's what you need look elsewhere.When you pick up an HDX you're picking up well crafted fun. The pixels are so pretty you'll want to shed a tear. Amazon's media access is so extensive you'll want for little, and combined with other services, you may just want for nothing.If you get an HDX no matter what you will find things that will bring you joy, hopefully for a few years to come. I wish I paid full price for device help if it malfunctions (they all do) because dealing with Amazon directly is usually a dream, but I got a great deal. I am absolutely pleasantly surprised and taken with this device, and I think you will be too if this is what you choose for your ereading and Amazon media needs.", "Date": "March 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best tablet/e-reader on the market! Great for the whole family!", "Author": "cnbf", "ReviewID": "RSZR8DXAWKYEK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I researched every tablet out there and decided on the kindle fire HDX 7\". I was bored of Apple (I have an iPhone and MacBook that I love but still...) and I didn't want just a tiny computer. I wanted something that was an entity all on its own. Something that could do it all but in a new fun way. My main requirements: camera, good price, and toddler friendly. I liked that the kindle fire hdx not only met all my requirements but far exceeded them also. It has FreeTime for kids which is well worth it alone, my daughter has unlimited instant access to hundreds of books, videos, and games with her favorite characters. You can get a subscription (4.99/month for one child 9.99 for a family) or just set up the child's own profile and fill it with the plenty of free kids apps available. I love that it's an android operating system. The apps are everything I need, yeah it's not hooked up with Google play or anything but I haven't found that to be a problem. Every app I wanted and am used to using on my iPhone is still available and all of my daughter's favorite apps are still here too. The picture and clarity of the screen is amazing and I found it to be much nicer than any of the other tablets I looked at. It has a great design, easy to hold for both adult and child, the sound is clear and great, it's super fast, I enjoy the silk browser, it is easy to use (if you are familiar with modern technology), we have been using it like crazy for a week now and there's isn't a single fault we can find. My husband can't even believe how great the graphics are. I am thrilled with my purchase and couldn't be happier. I also love that it's Amazon, a company I trust, and provides easy access to anything I want to do. There's also an app that connects to your local library early so you can \"borrow\" books directly onto your kindle. Kindle is also a major name so everything already (for the most part) has kindle compatibility. I really can't say it enough: I love our kindle. It's perfect and amazing and just what I wanted. In fact, while I was at best buy checking out tablets, there was another person there who had returned a Samsung tablet that was over $400 because she said she wasn't impressed and just didn't like it, she instead got a kindle fire HDX and loved it.", "Date": "March 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Long Time Apple Ipad User Amazed by Kindle HDX That Costs a Third As Much", "Author": "Pod", "ReviewID": "R3BOWQ0UMNGPF2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love the HDX.  I got it on special for $154 and at that price it's a freaking bargain.  I am a  longtime Ipad user (Ipad 2 and more recently Ipad Air) but I was looking for something more portable I could take on my subway ride to work and I didn't want to drop $400 for an Ipad Mini.  What really sold me on the HDX was that I could download free content from Prime and then watch that on the train and I would be able to use the device as a very portable reader.  I was expecting a significant downgrade from my Ipad Air in performance but have found myself blown away by:1. Feel:  The device is light, well built and has good tactile feel with a grippy, rubber like backing.  I bought a case (10 bucks) which was fine but I really liked holding the device without protection so I ditched it.2. Picture:  The picture quality for videos is amazing, far surpassing the Ipad Air's (or any other display I've seen):  I downloaded and watched (for free) an episode of Justified and was noticing slight blemishes and beads of sweat on people's faces.  The images are simply beautiful.3.  Performance:  The HDX is snappy with no lag whatsoever and very intuitive functionality. I was even able to side load a nook app and other Google Play apps in a matter of minutes following easy instructions on line.4.  Browser:  Silk is very quick and easy to use and works like Chrome (which can also be sideloaded but I prefer Silk)5. Customer Support: The Mayday function is revolutionary.  I have never waited more than 30 seconds for help and every rep has been friendly and competent (and native English speakers).  They have walked me through the necessary steps, drawing and highlighting on my unit, and even provided additional tips and suggestions.  Like others I had some issues with dropped WI-FI signals but the Mayday rep downloaded a WI-FI manager for me that maximizes the signal strength from my router and I haven't had a dropped signal since then, about a week ago.  One Mayday rep I spoke to said they spend a lot of time helping folks with basic non-HDX-specific functions on third party apps like Facebook or email like posting pictures or attaching documents.  The Mayday reps are also Amazon generalists and can handle customer service issues as well.6. Cloud storage: This was something I wasn't even aware of when I purchased the unit but copying photos from my Mac and music from Itunes into the Amazon cloud and onto the device was easy and free (2GB for photos and 250 songs).  I also have all my Nook books on the unit which I didn't know was something I could do.In summary I am very impressed with my HDX.  It's a very capable, inexpensive little device.  It won't replace my Ipad use at home but it's perfect for commuting and travelling places where I don't want to carry a larger device.  I have since purchased one for my mom for Mother's Day.  I originally purchased the Fire for her but the Mayday button would be so helpful for her, particularly with everyday functions like how to use Facebook, that I returned the Fire and upgraded to HDX.In brief response to comments from some of the the other reviewers: it is true that the universe of available apps is smaller than on Google Play or Itunes.  That's not really Amazon's fault and most Google Play apps can be side loaded with third-party software. The critical apps are all there.  Also, as other reviewers have noted, the HDX can drop WI-FI signals.  As discussed above, Amazon is aware of the issue and, according to the Mayday rep I spoke with, is working on a fix to be released with the next software update.  In the meantime, the third-party WiFi manager the rep downloaded onto my unit has worked perfectly.", "Date": "May 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Dissapointing technical support", "Author": "Larry Sassaman", "ReviewID": "R2I5UIE6Y91PM2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased the HDX in early Dec. 2013 and until last week was very pleased with the Kindle's performance.

It does appear to be just slightly more yellow on the right than the left, but it's not blotchy / spotty like the HDX it's replacing. I did an experiment to verify that I'm not imagining this tint - I set the Kindle overlapping my Macbook laptop screen, and side-by-side the difference in white is quite noticeable. However, since the tint is consistent and not blotchy, it doesn't take long for my brain to \"tune out\" the yellowness and accept the white as white while reading. I'm updating my rating from 2 stars to 3 stars. I'd give it 4 stars, because I like the tablet as a whole, except that it took me three tries to obtain a Kindle HDX with a \"tolerable\" screen (I'll be keeping this latest Kindle). If you were to put all three HDXs I've used side-by-side, each screen would be noticeably different than the other when reading text on a white background. That just should not be the case.-- ORIGINAL REVIEW --I would give the Kindle Fire HDX four or five stars if not for the problems I've had with the screen. I'm on my second HDX and have just requested my third. My first HDX had something akin to \"dead pixels\" - a brown spot under the glass that looked like someone focused the sun on that spot with a magnifying glass. I returned that device immediately, only to get a replacement with a different but even more distracting screen defect that I can best describe as \"muddiness.\"I've owned a variety of laptops and tablets over the years, including the previous Kindle HD, and I've never encountered a screen that looks like you're viewing it through a thin layer of dirty water. The uneven \"dirty\" white is mostly noticeable when reading black text on a white background - which is most of the time when using the browser, news apps, or even just reading a Kindle book.When I noticed this right away on the new HDX, I remembered the story of iPhones having a similar problem due to a screen adhesive that takes time to dry, so I kept my current tablet for close to a month, using it every day with the hope that this muddiness would go away on its own. It has not. It is HIGHLY distracting, and despite the crisper resolution, I find myself wanting to return to my old Kindle HD. I've requested a third HDX to replace this, but how many of these tablets must I go through to find one with even a decent display?Just in case you think I'm fussy, I have no problem with the blue glow on the sides. The glow is in the margins and doesn't overlap text or video. If the glow was the only issue, I'd still give this tablet 4 or 5 stars. Like I said, I have lots of screens in the house to compare this to, and it's obvious that Amazon's flagship tablet should be at least on par if not better than the average everyday LCD screen.Others have had similar problems (search \"yellow HDX\") , and yet others, including professional reviewers like Ars Technica, have NOT mentioned these screen problems. This and my own experiences lead me to believe that there is a breakdown in Quality Control / Quality Assurance in the manufacturing of these devices.

The new placement of the speakers on an angle helps boost sound when leaned against or played flat on a surface. The power button placement no longer causes me to accidentally turn off my Kindle. The resolution is ridiculously gorgeous. The charging port placement now allows for landscape use  while leaned against a surface. The 'mayday' customer service video call feature is fantastic with crazy fast response... which brings me to my reason for 4 out of 5 star review... I've found that when I have my Kindle charging while watching a video using headphones then remove the headphones the sound is all *bleeped* up. I can hear the background sounds along with music tracks but all voice in a movie is barely audible. I freaked out the 1st time not understanding so used the 'mayday' feature which was great but my tech guys voice was.. barely audible. I was able to make out what he was saying by giving him a close up of my ear canal and he did help me find the fix, to power down, not just turn off, then after the turn on it was fixed, YAY... BUT though it's fixable every time it happens, I'm very nervous that there's any type of hardware/software issue right out of the gate!! I've read strong negative reviews about the purchasable warranty not covering anywhere close to replacement cost so I can't see spending the pretty penny for that and am just praying that this baby won't tank on me because there's no way I could afford to replace it so soon after having to pay my insurances deductible to replace the Kindle Fire HD (Previous Generation) that was stolen this month.

The reviews are as inconsistent as the boarders around your visual experience.  For me personally it is the left side boarder.  There is a sliver of a difference on the left side but it makes a big difference for people who have any visual difficulty including headaches.I called up Amazon to see what they were going to do about it and the response I got was just as inconsistent as the Kindle's HDX 7 boarders.  \"I can guaranty that the replacement we send you will not have this problem.\"  When I told him that I had read the reviews to see if this was just a problem with my Kindle HDX 7 the story changed to \"The Kindle 7 HDX as blue LED lights which cause differences in the boarders.\"  Really?  I told Carlos, from the Kindle help department, to not send me a Kindle 7 HDX replacement but the 8.9, which according to him is different.  Carlos said that he would send me a link for a pre-paid mailing label.  That was it.

I use it for music, games, checking my email, social media, reading, and watching movies on Netflix. If you want to do it, you can probably do it on this device.-Gorgeous vibrant colors-More responsive touch screen then the kindle fire HD which means better control over whatever you are doing (especially important when I'm gaming!)-Physical buttons-Loud speakers-Quad processors make it run very smoothly (much better then the HD)-Came with a wall adapter and charges faster then the kindle fire HD-Updated email app easier to work with then the kindle fire HD's-Updated photo app makes focusing the camera easy-Music player is better organized and more functional-Rubberized backing makes a great grip, though this has not changed-Better accessories then Kindle Fire HD right out the door (I'm looking at you, origami case!)-Lock screen ads lead to FREE stuff and coupons! Why would I pay $15 to lose out on saving money??Cons:-Physical buttons placed in slightly strange places if you use the device primarily in portrait mode (I only switch to landscape if a game I'm playing needs it or I'm watching a movie). I've had the kindle fire HD for almost a year so I'm used to the buttons being in a set place so if you're upgrading that's something to keep in mind.-Charger and headphone ports are slightly slanted so when plugged in the cords jut out in a strange way-The infamous purple/blue light (I personally don't mind it since everything else is so gorgeous but you definitely do notice it while reading so I'm including it in cons I guess as a warning to others)-I preferred the curves on the back, if it ain't broke why fix it? BUT if you've never used a kindle fire HD you won't miss it at all so this isn't really a con per se.Amazon has outdone itself in my opinion. I was a big fan of the Kindle HD (which I had for 8 months) and used it constantly. I prefer Kindle greatly to my iPhone and Kindle tablets may be the reason I switch to an android phone because of how preferable I find it. The ease of use in transferring books and music is unbeatable. Drag and drop and be done with it! And though Amazon tries to push itself on you (no google market on the kindle, amazon cloud, ect) they never do anything as annoying as apple with iTunes. Kindle marries together the simplicity and straight forwardness of using an iPhone (EVERYBODY knows how to use one of those) with the customization and ease of an android. Beginners and pros alike can find something to enjoy on the Kindle HDX.And what's better is everything that people mentioned they didn't like in their reviews of the Kindle HD, Amazon fixed with this tablet. They learned their lesson and included the charger adapter, they made HD content more accessible and better quality, and upped the ante with two more processors with those who felt the Kindle couldn't keep up with their content. They even upgraded Silk to be a better browser! This is basically unprecedented with physical stores because they don't have a consistent reviewing system where the consumer literally says what they liked and don't like. It's great to know Amazon is listening.I'm very satisfied with this purchase (bought from Radioshack, not amazon so it would be here on time for Christmas) and will continue to buy Amazon's tablets whenever they come out and it's time to upgrade. I may update the review as time goes on because I DID just get the kindle for Christmas, but I've been a big fan of Amazon and Amazon Kindle tablets for years now.Edit 1: I've had the kindle for a few weeks now and I still adore it, but the buttons are quickly becoming a big hassle. I don't have 50 dollars to kick out for the official cases but because of the sudden change of the buttons locations finding different cases is extremely hard unless you search through amazon itself. For those who like ordering from amazon this is not really an issue, but those who would like to find a bargain without paying shipping on a case this is a downside.I was split on the button at first because I understand they wanted to change where the buttons are but because of the fact that I can never remember where the power button is and the case issue that's definitely a con.", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wow, the screen and sound are amazing", "Author": "Mema \"Wife, Mother, Mema, Sister\"", "ReviewID": "R3AR2BBRDJ0499", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I generally read on my Kindle and this HDX is great for reading, yes there is a hint of purple around the edges but frankly once I start reading I don't even notice it, probably would never have noticed it but for other reviews.

Overall these are excellent tablets, however, there are some drawbacks for parents:- You can not add passwords to each child's profile.  (If you have multiple children, they can easily prank each other by modifying or deleting content from another child's profile so be prepared for drama.)- The child or parent must enter the parental controls password every single time they exit from freetime. If you envision them being able to use freetime, but also to be able to exit freetime to use skype, youtube, the camera, or any other features outside of freetime app, this is a BIG PROBLEM.  The password they have to enter to exit freetime is the same parental controls password that prevents them from making purchases. Making the parental controls useless if you want your child to be able to use the tablet outside of freetime.-  There is no way to set up your children on your amazon account without them also having full access to all of your amazon account information, order history, and all of your other Amazon content.  You can get around this by setting up a separate email and amazon account just for children's kindles. but it is a hassle which still requires a credit card, or prepaid visa credit card if you anticipate using any apps.-  Very popular apps are not always available on kindle and this can cause big drama.  Two of our children got Furby Booms and expected to be able to use the Furby Boom App on their Kindle Fire HDX 7s.  The Furby Boom App is NOT available for Kindle Fire HDX.

Only after I do that will the streaming app reinitialize again.  This is a royal pain in the butt in my opinion and i would hope that Kindle and partners come together to address these issues.  Very well could be software bugs that need to be worked out but so far no side has taken responsibilities to address it.2) t's a bit on heavy side with the leather Origami case.

Overall, this is a pretty good choice if you are looking for something that runs smoothly. I really was impressed by the image quality, every thing looks gorgeous on this tablet, much better than my laptop! The processor keeps this device really quick with apps and while watching movies and surfing the web (depending on WiFi of course). The HDX also really shines if you have Amazon prime as you will have access to a variety of free movies and media! For all that this tablet can offer in terms of functionality, the price is really one of the better values out there right now.Despite some of the aforementioned positives, I there are a couple huge disadvantages to owning this tablet. If you plan on using a wide variety of apps, then you're going to be sorely disappointed. App development for Kindle is still in its infancy and only a handful of even the most popular apps on other devices seem to be available. One of the main things that I bought the HDX for was to surf the web without the need for a clunky laptop. For the most part, it can do this just fine, but when it comes to watching a video this tablet will let you down. I find that since there is no youtube app that I need to go to YouTube's site on the browser. When I try to watch the youtube video in full screen while holding the tablet horizontally, the address bar is always at the top blocking out some of the video! I have tried every button/setting but nothing seems to remove this. The other thing with videos that drives me mad is that most embedded videos on blogs and webpages cannot go into full screen mode. I need to click and double click on them repeatedly just to make the video big enough to be seen. Some embedded videos I have found to not work at all. This is really a huge disadvantage for me and really needs to be fixed.To summarize, the HDX is a great functioning device that performs great in terms of hardware specs, but there is much improvement to be made in regards to software aspects.UPDATE:4/21: I was disheartened the learn that the kindle does not support Adobe Flash player.

The Origami case is really cool too. For reading books it's unparalleled since its lightweight and the text is very clear. The battery far outlasts my Nook Tablet's battery and my HP Touchpad's battery.I wasn't aware that Amazon still owned my Kindle after it was paid for. They automatically push out updates without allowing you to opt out. Wanna root your tablet? Want to turn off ads on your device without shelling out $15 extra dollars after you just spent $200+ on your tablet? Want to get access to Google play and Google apps and not be limited to what Amazon has in their app store (which lacks a lot of big name apps of no-brainer-we-should-support-this mobile ubiquity)? Too bad. Amazon will continue to update your Kindle whether you want them to or not. Seriously, can you believe on an ANDROID device there isn't an official Youtube app? Or Google Drive? What about Dropbox? Clash of Clans? Xbox smartglass?  Most things that aren't Facebook or Twitter? Customization of any kind? Any high quality apps for musicians? Look elsewhere. The hardware is very capable, but the software isn't even a fraction of what's available on iOS or even full Android. If there were a good app selection a root wouldn't be needed, but there isn't, so that makes the auto updates & ads (Amazon backed adware) a problem.", "Date": "April 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Kindle FIre", "Author": "Jason Strauss", "ReviewID": "R3NNWNVIZAD5JZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This was a gift for my daughter.

The bottom line is that the processor is much faster. Everything else in comparison like the display, size, sound and battery life are pretty much the same. The only thing is that the HDX has a different look for the Android Operating System which is actually very nice. It also doesn't have a rear facing camera, it only has a front facing one, like for apps such as Skype. We almost always use our cellphones for taking pictures, so that wasn't really a big concern for us.I would also recommend NOT paying the $15 to remove the lock screen only advertisements. My wife has already used them and they are actually pretty good. I really don't believe it's worth the money to have the ads removed but you can always pay the $15 at a later date if you eventually decide to remove them.Now that my wife actually has the HDX for over a month now, I realize that it's great and she really, really loves it!You will not be disappointed in purchasing the HDX, trust me, GET IT!!!VERY HELPFUL COMPARISON URL:blog.laptopmag.com/amazon-kindle-fire-hdx-vs-google-nexus-7", "Date": "February 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Hope Your Kindle Happens To Work!", "Author": "RMG", "ReviewID": "RIEVT7Q0FCVBD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased the new kindle fire HDX in December.

I'm not sure if this is because my Galaxy S4 is just enough (in terms of size) for me to do most of the things I need to do or if it is because a couple things about the HDX Fire that annoy me and thus got me to use it less.First, the charger it comes with is just too slow.  I realize the original charger is a 'slow' version and a 'fast' charger is sold separately, but the slow should not be a snail crawl charger.  Also, the Kindle crashed on me.  I called customer care, they helped me quickly reset the device to factory settings and it seemed to have fixed it.  I am concerned I have a defect though.  Regardless, they say I have a warranty and can get it replaced anytime within a year (I hope this stands true).  I'm always gun shy to exchange things quickly because OEMs tend to send you a refurb for your new device.These two items make the device a neutral buy rating for me.

However, after receiving the kindle I realized that 2 of the 10 or so apps that I do use were unavailable (Dropbox and Olive Tree Bible Study). Before ordering I had inquired with Olive Tree and been told they had a kindle fire app. Unfortunately they're experiencing delays with amazon and the hDX. I assume that will work out eventually. But no Dropbox is a total deal-breaker for me.I decided to switch with my husband who has the original iPad mini.  He is loving the kindle fire hDX.

For the price of a Kindle Fire HDX, you will not find anything better. I'm not a techno-wiz or anything like that, I've merely had the opportunity to use different types of tablets since members of my family keep winning them in drawings (e.g. Galaxy tab, Nexus, iPad, iPad mini). I actually bought this one because I wanted a tablet and it was less than half the price of the others when Amazon gave me special offers.I was initially worried about how complicated it might be to use, especially since I'm more familiar with the iPad interface, but I found the Kindle to be quite easy to operate. If I ever had a problem, I'd have the best customer support in seconds with the 'Mayday' button.It's fast- it's never really had a lag for anything that I've tried. The buttons are out of the way, but easy to find and use. The sound is by far superior to all other tablets, as is the display. It also feels better in the hand then other tablets.As with all non-iOS products, it doesn't have all of the apps or usability that I'd like, but that will come with time. Two notable apps that are absent from the market are Youtube and Instagram. I'm sure more developers will jump on board, especially since this tablet has proven to be extremely usable.If you are looking for larger text or screen size, the 7\" might be a bit too small. Also, if you aren't an Amazon Prime member, the Kindle might not have as many perks (e.g. instant video, lending library, etc). However, it still is great as a standalone tablet (although I'd recommend using the Prime services with your Kindle if you choose to purchase it; they are definitely worth the price).All in all, it's a top-tier competitor in the tablet market and it's also one of the cheapest. If you're considering this and the iPad mini or Nexus, really look into the Kindle or try it out.UPDATE (December 2013)I finally had the opportunity to use the Mayday service due to a downloading issue. It was about 10:30 PM. I tapped the Mayday button and within ten seconds I was in video contact with a representative from Amazon. In less than five minutes, they were able to visually show me the issue with my tablet and help me to solve it. I understood every word that they said (it wasn't outsourced) and it was by far the best tech-issue customer service contact I've ever had. I can usually solve any issues on my own, but having this feature for the times when I'm stuck is very nice.Many other reviews have mentioned the display issues at the border.

After spending only a few moments, from setup to navigating through various apps (books, web, videos, etc...), I must say that the device is near flawless.  The unboxing and setup process were as effortless as anyone could hope for.  The performance is spectacular and allowed navigating around the various screens with lightening quickness.  The feel in my hands is wonderful, in terms of size, weight, shape, and texture.  Heck, I even tried out the Mayday button and I must confess it is probably the greatest customer service experience I have had in memory and probably ever.Finally, I come to the topic that has been discussed in so many prior reviews.  This display is beautiful, vibrant and precise.  Unfortunately, this perfection is inexcusably blemished by an uneven purple haze around its outer edges.  This haze is almost twice as wide along one length of the device compared to the opposite side and contrasts so much with the otherwise flawless display, that it provides a distraction I cannot live with.I literally fell in love with your \"near masterpiece\" in just minutes.  So much so that I mentally tried to convince myself that the many fine attributes outweighed this single flaw (\"Gee, maybe I'll get used to it?\"), but alas I realize that, like so many others, this is something that I cannot bring myself to \"settle\" with.I am returning your amazing invention with great regret and I hope that your talented team can resolve this unacceptable issue as quickly as possible.

Further every tablet can download the kindle app or some type of e-reader app for books. The kindle tablet has limited access to the app market where android and apple are almost pretty equal. Amazon talks up a great game with this tablet, but I don't think it owns up to the price. Lastly I bought this to use almost as a portable laptop because I read you can VIEW Microsoft office documents. I first mis-read this for using Microsoft office. The kindle does not offer such a feature you can only simply view these things.

Bought the Kindle DX, then upgraded to the Kindle HD last year and purchased Amazon prime for the Prime streaming of TV and movies. So when they announced the new HDX would allow for downloading prime movies and TV shows I thought it would be fantastic. I use the Kindle for reading alot and also for watching the movies and TV episodes while exercising. So I thought with the new HDX and being able to download the prime TV/movies, it would be perfect for those hotels which have very poor wifi in the fitness room and I could also watch movies/TV on the plane.Well, watching the movies and TV shows are much better than the HD, but it comes at a cost, and to me it's a big cost. The reading experience on the new HDX is terrible. The blue/purple line is definitely noticeable, not only when reading but also on anything with a white background, including email and web pages. This is not actually a major problem for me but I can see how some people would find it distracting. My major issue with the HDX is the color of the backgrounds while reading. As noted in some previous reviews, the black background is not black, it's grey but my biggest problem is the white background. It's not white, it's off white/light yellow. When comparing to an iPhone/iPad and even the previous HD, it definitely has a yellow tint. The fact that it's a little bit of a yellow background wouldn't be such a big deal, but it's blotchy. Most of the screen will be a yellowish color while there are small sections that are the bluish white color. I notified Amazon of this and they sent me out a new one but the new one was actually worse than my original. The \"blotchiness\" was larger and the yellow color was more noticeable. Plus, the blue/purple color was more noticeable as well. I also went to Best Buy to look at the HDXs and the yellow color was on those as well. This yellow color in a lighted environment is subdued, but when you're reading at night in bed with the lights off, the yellow color and blotchiness is very noticeable.Another disappointment is the battery power. The battery doesn't last anywhere near as long as the HD. As I said, I read alot and before with the HD I could go weeks without having to recharge which was great with the amount I travel so I wouldn't have to bring the cords because I could just recharge back at home. However, with the HDX, I have to recharge every 3-4 days which means I have to bring the cords with me when I travel.The Mayday feature is NOTHING like they show on TV. The video is not very clear and the audio is very delayed. The service reps also don't know anything other than telling you to reset the device and then if that doesn't work, someone will call you back on the phone, thereby not even using the Mayday feature.Also, the screen on the HDX is no better in the sun than the HD, which I was led to believe it would be better. Not sure if this was a misunderstanding on my part, but it's not better than the HD. In comparison with the iPad (mini), the iPad is way better to read in the sun and I don't mean just a little better, but way better.I'm just very disappointed. I've never had any problems with Amazon before but it just seems they didn't think things through on the HDX. The Kindle has always been a great reading device, so it seems they wanted to improve the viewing experience for games and movies/TV to be better than Apple. But they did it at the expense of the reading experience, which is a big disappointment for those of us that like to read.I could continue asking for new HDXs, but what's the point? I've already seen 4 and they've all had this problem, and the replacements could be worse than the original like my one replacement already was. Do I go back to the HD? If I do that I lose the ability to download the prime TV/movies which is a great feature. Do I get a Kindle paper white for reading? Well, then I have to carry 2 tablets with me which is ridiculous. Should I purchase the 8.9 inch which supposedly doesn't have some of these issues? Well, the 8.9 inch is bigger, bulkier, heavier and more expensive and space/weight is a premium with the amount I travel. Do I begin using my iPad mini? Then again I lose the ability of the prime downloading. So I guess I'll keep the original HDX and hope Amazon addresses the reading issues on the next upgrade, but with the way they've been responding with these issues on the HDX, it seems like they don't think the issues are a problem.So, if you'll primarily use the 7 inch HDX for gaming, and viewing videos, you'll probably really enjoy it. However, if you plan to read a lot on the HDX, this is probably not the device for you.", "Date": "January 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very Impressive", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"jlambert1982\"", "ReviewID": "RML3THOX9TJ06", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros:The size.  I have an original iPad and an 8.9 Fire HD from last year.  I never thought I'd be want the smaller size, but this is perfect.  I no longer play games on my phone, b/c this thing is easy enough to carry around I take it everywhere.  In fact, if I didn't use my phone's hotspot to give this thing connectivity I would consider dropping my phone all together and using this thing to make calls from.The screen.  This thing looks amazing.  A co-worker has the new iPad Air. Side by side we both think this little guy blows it out of the water.  We pull up the same images from google and it is easy to see the difference.The performance.  My biggest complaint about the 8.9 Kindle Fire HD was that it was laggy.  Pulling up apps would take too long compared to my Galaxy S 4 or my son's iPod touch.  Apps would crash before they opened.  Videos would stall between clicking play and the video actually playing.  This little powerhouse has eliminated almost all of that.  Apps still crash, but I'll get to that later.Cons:Storage.  I live on a farm.  Beyond satellite and cell coverage I have no options for high speed internet.  I do get LTE where I live, but that is on a limited basis, and my satellite broadband has a data cap as well.  It would be nice to download season's of television while I am at work or travelling and store them on my device.  64GB seems like a lot, but between apps, books, audiobooks, and HD video, it still fills up fast.  A 128GB version would have been worth it to me.Video output.  On my Kindle Fire HD I could bring an HDMI cable with me wherever I went, and as long as there was free HDMI input on the television, I could watch my videos.  Now I have to watch through my PS3 (which I could already do with Amazon Instant Video) or the newer Samsung televisions (but not my 2011 55 inch LED).  Kind of frustrating.  Even my kid's iPod Touch has HDMI out with an adapter.App availability.  I love Amazon App Store.  It is a lot easier to navigate than Google Play, and you don't have the multitude of worthless apps.  However, there are tons of apps that I use on my phone that just are not available through Amazon.  I use Google Voice to check voicemails and send messages.  While I can do that through the Silk browser, why can't I have that option?  Everyone I know who owns a Kindle Fire has their own personal complaint about an app they can't use.Summary:I love my HDX.  To me, this is the perfect size for a tablet, and this thing performs like a monster.  It has replaced all my other tablets.  I still have a very large library of movies and TV shows in iTunes, and it continues to grow b/c of my wife's love of her iPhone and my kid's reliance on their iPods, so I can't just shut down my iTunes account yet.  For me personally, however, I'll never have to use iTunes again.  Everything this device is supposed to do, it does great.  It is a great e-reader.  It is a great video player.  It is a great music player.  I started reading comics again when I bought the 8.9 inch Fire HD last year because of how great that device was for the comic book format.  The 7 inch HDX is just as good.  Note taking, game playing, time killing.....You name it, this device does it.Right now I don't know who I wouldn't recommend this to.  Thinking about spending 150 bucks on your kids and buying them a LeapPad Ultra?  Spend the extra money up front and get them a device that is worth the money in the long run.  Between the free apps and device quality, that is a no brainer.Have grandparent who watches old TV channels and reads books?  Give them this and tell them to pay for Prime, and cancel their cable bill.My only complaints are minor.  I knock off one star because I don't like the idea of being locked into their ecosystem of apps.  That is very Apple of them, and while I understand the business to it, I still don't appreciate it.  If I could make any improvements, I wish Amazon would let me import my library of videos from iTunes to their cloud like they did my music.  If they could make that happen, I would be a fully converted form .mac fanboy.Buy without hesitation if you are a Prime member or just starting your digital video library.  I would hesitate slightly if I had thousands invested in iTunes videos and apps, but even then, for $230, it may be worth it just to see if you like it better.", "Date": "December 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice tablet but still room for improvement", "Author": "Brian", "ReviewID": "R398UH9UFG0YA1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've previously owned one other tablet -- the iPad 1.  I received it as a birthday present ~3 years ago, and sold it last year back to Apple as part of their buyback program.  I liked the iPad, but found it slightly too heavy, wide, and slow (after upgrading iOS).  The screen resolution also was subpar compared to modern standards.Fast forward to today and I've dove head-first back into the tablet world with the 7\" Kindle Fire HDX.  All of my complaints stated above are no longer apparent with the Kindle Fire HDX.  It is light, narrow (can easily grip with one hand, although not as narrow as the Nexus 7), and whip-fast.  Screen resolution is as crisp as they come.My biggest complains are that (1) the ads are semi-annoying, and (2) the whole \"user experience\" appears to revolve around the consumer buying a bunch of stuff from Amazon.  With the Nexus 7 or iPad, there is less emphasis on \"buying stuff\" and more emphasis on \"doing stuff\" (e.g. a less commercial experience).Still, for the price ($179 on Cyber Monday), I can't complain too much.  I will say, though, that depending on the promotion at the time, if the Nexus 7 and Kindle HDX are the same price, I'd probably actually prefer the Nexus 7 for a more traditional tablet experience.

The lighter weight of this tablet is fantastic and feels great in my hands.

The display is gorgeous and I have enjoyed watching and listening (those little speakers sound awesome and an improvement over the original Fire) to missed episodes of my favorite shows.  I have to admit I was concerned that I wouldn't be able to retrieve my emails or google calendar after reading some of the reviews, but I didn't need to worry because it has worked great!

The eink has no back light and it is strictly black and white.I had no problem copying all my books and documents from the old to the new using my computer.  I\u2019ve found that for just reading books the eink was a little easier to use was a lot lighter and the battery life was unbelievably long lasting almost a month between charges.  As for reading it takes a while to get use to the touch pad screen of the HDX and I find myself making a bookmark on every page which is a drag because if I fall asleep and the HDX drops I could be a hundred pages away or even on a different app when I sake up.  Yesterday morning I woke up to find I apparently bought the book I was reading when it had dropped from my grasp when I feel asleep.  Oh, this was easy to correct, so no harm done.  The only other negative things are its weight and battery life.  It feels twice as heavy as the eink and the battery life is poor at best, it has to be charged at least every day.Pros:The Mayday button is Great!  It didn\u2019t take me more than 15 minutes to get into trouble and rather trying to figure out what I had done wrong I pressed the Mayday button and had a person talking to me, explaining what was wrong and fixing the problem.  The app I was having a problem with this person had never seen before but yet stayed with me and helped me figure it out.  I had expected him to blow me off, after all how can he possibly know the intricacies if every 3rd party app, but he found a solution.  Kindle must be very proud of their Help Desk because it\u2019s one of the best around.  I\u2019ve had 2 other times I used Mayday and all the people that have helped found solutions, and were very courteous.Even though I love the eink reader for books the HDX overpowers with its apps and shear speed.  I find myself using the HDX to check Email, Contacts and my Calendar because it\u2019s faster than starting up my computer.  The Silk browser is 100 times better than the one on the eink.  The eink has only a handful of apps while the HDX is almost overwhelming with great apps.  The HDX has so much more to offer that I haven\u2019t gone back to my eink and never will.  Come on-- this thing plays music, videos, you can watch TV, browse the Internet, check your email, read newspapers and magazines, do work from the office and play games plus if you get into trouble there is someone at the press of a button that helps.

I have had ever version of it so far.  I love the screen....it is fantastic.  I like the layout.  I only see a bit of blue around the edges when I read a book, but it's really nothing terribly noticeable and it does not bother me any.  I like that it is thinner and lighter.  The only things I would change are:  I would have a HDMI port because that beats paying $50.00 for a converter to be able to watch movies on my TV.  I would not put the power button and volume buttons on the back, it's way to easy to touch them accidentally.  I like where they were before.  They were a bit less accessible before, but having a cover that put my kindle to sleep made it a mute point.  Also you can adjust the volume on-screen.  I would rather have the buttons where you can't touch them accidentally.  But none of these are game changers, it's still a better tablet than before even though I loved my Kindle HD also.  Hopefully Amazon will take these reviews to heart and use them when designing the next model.  It's a great value for the money!  I love it!  Update 1 month later:  I had problems with my first Kindle HDX, almost every time I changed it to Airplane mode off or on, it would turn off and then come back on to the home screen.  This was very annoying, so I returned it for another Kindle HDX.  The 2nd one had a blue spot on the screen that was like a small blue cloud that did not move and was there no matter what.  This changed the color of what I was watching or when reading, I could see it quite clearly.  I returned that Kindle also, because when you buy a brand new Kindle, it should work perfectly.  The 3rd Kindle that I got was REFURBISHED!!! The screen is fine, but guess what?  The airplane mode thing is happening with this one too, and guess what else - they will not take a refurbished Kindle back even though it was Amazon's mistake to send me one.  The offered me a partial refund instead, which I accepted, but I am not a happy camper.  A brand new product should not have these problems.  My Kindle HD never had any of these problems and still works just fine.

Amazon pushed me to Google movies and other tablets with business features.However, the new ability to download for no additional cost much of its Prime content for off line viewing for up to 30 days for each downloaded movie/show and the new wireless video display via Miracast was too much to pass up, or at least try.Incidentally, I bought the new Nexus 7 at the same time but returned it because you can not stream movies download to the unit.  One is required to delete the saved Google purchased movie from the unit and stream via the internet.  GO FIGURE.  Im not required to do this with my other android tablet.

I can honestly say that there is no other tablet that provides the value for the cost.Screen: 5 out of 5In order to really appreciate the screen, you need to download at \"best quality\" an hd show or movie from amazon prime. Then you need to compare it to an hd video on another tablet. The screen color and clarity is absolutely amazing.Sound: 5 out of 5Coming from an Apple device owner, I never expected much for sound quality from tablets until I got the kindle fire hdx. The sound is crystal clear and loud! I don't quite understand how it works because I have tried covering the sound ports but the sound is still loud like it may be coming from around the screen as well. Try it, you will be impressed.Build Quality: 5 out of 5You can tell that this tablet has a magnesium frame built in. There is zero flex when holding or moving the tablet around. Compared to the Nexus 7 which also has a rubberized grip, you can tell that the nexus 7 is plastic and the kindle is metal on the inside. The build quality rivals the iPad mini.Processing: 5 out of 5Phenomenal speed doing any task you can imagine. Everything is instant with no delay at all. Loading up videos on youtube is much faster than on an iPad, which is most likely due to the dual antenna wifi for the kindle hdx. There is zero stutter playing hd games like Fifa Soccer 14 and watching 1080p videos.Battery Life: 5 out of 5This was the one aspect I expected to suffer being that it is an android based device. Battery life never seems to live up to what the manufacturer claims because android seems to just drain the battery. I have been using the device for a couple days and so far, it really does live up to the claims. After watching several hours of video I still find the battery life around 80%. Charging is also quick. I expect that it will only take a couple hours to go from 0% to 100% charged.Overall: 5 out of 5This is THE tablet to own for 2013-2014. Amazon has set the price of the kindle fire hdx to dominate the tablet market. Unlike other tablets such as the nexus 7, the kindle fire hdx doesn't sacrifice build quality to bring the cost down. This tablet should honestly be $329 starting like the iPad mini, but Amazon is pricing the tablet to acquire market share and make back money from app, video, book, and Amazon purchases. Even if your not a prime member, you should buy this tablet and become a prime member because it is very worth it. With all the new kindle fire hdx owners, the Amazon prime showcase should expand significantly too as Amazon brings more content to customers.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "KIndle camera", "Author": "Dwight Myers", "ReviewID": "R144UUVQQZYZME", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "If \"front facing\" camera means I can only take \"selfies\" I will keep my Ipad mini.

I love it! It is much lighter weight ,a feature I was looking for,and the playback is amazing. The buffering during movies I've rented is minimal. The picture on a couple rentals was not the greatest, but then again on others was crystal clear. I use my kindle in the same manner I use my iPad. It searches the net very well, e mail great, music playback nice. Keyboard responds well to touch. Lastly I had to use the Mayday button for an issue on the keyboard. I somehow split it into 2 sections making half the board to the left the other half to the right, leaving a gap in the middle of the screen. I touched mayday and viola!  A screen appeared with a live feed from a tech ! He was courteous knowledgeable and marked my keyboard with a blue arrow showing me exactly where to go to fix the keyboard display. It was awesome.  It took maybe 3 minutes. Great addition. I have one gripe though. I' m not seeing my amazon account in its entirety on the kindle, nor is the order experience the same as it is from an iPad or PC. And I feel the amazon prime account has changed. From the kindle I couldn't find much in the way of prime movies. I was directed to other apps such as Netflix . Is Amazon getting out of the \"movie business\"? Experience with the book rental was similar . Not complaining really just saying.i love amazon!

I find very useful the text-to-speech to listen to the technical books I have to read as I do other tasks, like during morning ablutions.  I like the placement of the on/off switch, and the volume up/down switches, but the power connection being on an angle threw me.  I thought something inside got bent, but that I found out was by design.  Not sure why that is.  Really like the Mayday feature, this was a game changer for me, and had to use it right off the bat because my first HDX didn't deliver the right side audio channel when I plugged in my apple earbuds, but the HDX audio was fine withOUT the earbuds plugged in, not good for viewing movies in a public place. My older first edition KindleFire worked fine with my Apple earbuds, but not with the HDX.  With the Mayday tech, tried different settings, different earbuds, unplugging/ replugging earbuds into HDX audio port, various power cycling, resetting the HDX to default, escalated to deeper tech support, nothing worked, so Amazon actually sent me a new HDX replacement device and I returned mine that had no right side audio channel using earbuds.  The replacement new HDX device came in with  its right side audio channel working with the Apple earbuds!  I am very pleased.  The new technological advancements of this new HDX Kindle are very positive and noteworthy, and I would say it is worth upgrading to this HDX version, but for these advancements, there is a cost - battery energy supply gets used up sooner than the previous version Kindle Fire.  That is ok, and understandable for all the graphical/ sound enhancements and back end support of them in this new KindleFire HDX version.  Hopefully battery technology will catch up soon to keep up with the needs of our advancing electronic toys that are a driving force in technology.

The processor is amazingly fast and the graphics engine is top of the line.  Response times are instantaneous and I have found no lag in the OS.  I'm not sure how they do it but the sound and volume on this thing is incredible.  The keyboard has swipe built in and it works well plus I also like the ease of adding new words to the dictionary. The ability to add your own words to the dictionary is incredibly useful for customizing your Kindle Fire to be adapted to your personal way of thought and speech. If you are a member of Amazon Prime the Kindle Fire is a one stop experience for shopping, books, games, and video. The real problem is in the limited OS that Amazon has created to push its app store.  This could cause problems for people who are, like myself, used to the full access of the Google Play store which you cannot use. This also means that apps that are free on Google Play might cost you money on the Amazon store. This tablet also doesn't have flash along with all modern Android and Apple products. Flash is available on Windows tablets if that is something you need. Gaming seems to work well except for some second screen features, like Battlefield's Commander app, on my Xbox One. Second screen does allow me to use the Kindle Fire as a keyboard and mouse for the Xbox One which makes surfing the web and navigating menus much easier.

When web-based technology works well, it is amazingly convenient, but when there is a problem with something you've come to depend on, it is so hard to get help.  Especially with a 2 year old tugging at your...everything.  However, the Mayday feature of my new kindle is fantastic.  To have a person who can hear your voice answer your questions immediately, and solve your issue within seconds is just invaluable to this busy mom.  No more email back and forth conversations with customer service reps that didn't read the entirety of my message or didn't answer my question fully, necessitating a problem solving session lasting for days.  A person and a voice that can respond immediately is a breath of fresh air.  I would have given the Kindle HDX 3 or 4 stars before using Mayday (mostly because I prefer the Mac look but and feel and probably should have bought an ipad mini) but this service is just so impressive and beats having to go to a genius bar and wait in line for 45 minutes or more that I'm completely sold on the Kindle.", "Date": "March 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome!", "Author": "Eva \"Eva\"", "ReviewID": "R1UIHN524VIQII", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I absolutely love it!

My old tablet looks like crap after seeing the quality of this Kindle. It is very \"user friendly\". I thought I might need to buy a book to help me figure it out, but it is pretty straightforward and there is a help function built in. It is sooooo faaaaaast!!!! I am loading apps in 1 second compared to 10 or 15 seconds. I guess that is the difference between the dual core and quad core. I already had most of my apps from the Amazon App Store, so that was a bonus. This tablet comes pre-installed with the Amazon App Store (which gives away one free app of the day FAOTD every day). Transferring to the new tablet was almost seamless. You have the option at setup to become an Amazon Prime member, which would be good if you like to watch TV episodes or movies (one free month, then pay). Amazon Customer Service is fantastic too!! Maybe some of the people that complain about it would complain about anything, no matter what! I found Amazon Customer Service knowledgeable, kind, FAST with helping.

My bank app isn't available (capital one).  No YouTube app. No podcast player app. My favorite game app doesn't make them for the kindle. No decent weather apps are available. Second, you are stuck with the kindle browser, Silk. No chrome, Firefox, atomic, or safari. Silk is an ok browser but it doesn't handle embedded video very well. Lots of freezing and unexpected hangs. Bookmarks are awkward. Third, the touch screen is glitchier than my iPad. The cursor jumps around randomly. Good luck getting the cursor to go where you want it to when typing. Fourth, it's not easy to switch between apps. The OS stores everything in memory and the performance suffers if you use too many apps, and there's no way to close the ones you aren't using. I found myself shutting it down and restarting frequently. Fifth, a big selling point was the \"one free rental book a month\" deal with the kindle. But the selection is SMALL and it's impossible to search the lending library. Amazon sells the \"lending library\" hard, but it's clear it's not ready for primetime. Finally, some of my favorite websites are slow and glitchy with the silk browser (like slate).

My previous kindle charged quickly even in use and had an amazing battery life!  I even called customer service and they said there's was a problem with it. Guess what? When I was sent the new one it worked just as bad as before.My next issue is What happened to flash player?!  My old kindle has it! And now when I go to watch certain shows I used to watch or when I go to amazon to view a product video I can't view it anymore!!Next ..  i used to watch the network apps such as the cw ect..  on my previous tablet and still do with no problems. but when i watch them on my HDX they time out whenever the commercial break happens, I have to actually exit the app ,go into my wifi , turn it off, and then back on again to get it to work! Once back in i have to fast foward to where i left off ! This is something i also asked about when in called customer service and was told it was the kindle and my internet. if this were true then why does it work perfectly on the old kindle? Again got the new HDX replaced and still have same issue to this day. It's not my Internet !  I've even been to places that only use one device in there home and have way better internet than me and my kindle still does this ! It was a huge disappointment!In my opinion they took more away and only added a camera.  If they keep this up I don't think I'll be buying anymore kindles in the future.

One of the first things I tried to do was download the User Guide - so far, I have been unsuccessful - it has simply taken too long and it times-out. It seems reasonable that there should be an easier (faster) way.  While I am computer \"literate\", it has been slow finding my way around all that the HDX offers.One of the reasons I selected the HDX was the availability of the Skype App.  When I installed it, however, Skype advised that they were blocking my account - because of a break-in that occurred in 2010. Everything was resolved by Skype and my bank, and I have been using Skype on my desktop ever since.  Working with Skype to unblock my account was endlessly frustrating.A minor point. I have used Every Word: Crossing on a previous Kindle.  I expected to use it on the HDX. However, after searching the Kindle website, I finally determined it was not compatible with the HDX. Subsequently, I purchase (it was free) the App Every Word - and received confirmation.  However, it was never delivered.  Your helpful tech determined that (again) it was not compatible with the HDX.  Not a crises - just a bit irritating.I have not yet used the Amazon Assist feature yet - but I think the offering is excellent.In one of the reviews I read before selecting the HDX, the reviewer commented that the On/Off button was in an awkward place - I agree.Thank you for the opportunity to comment.", "Date": "January 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Mayday", "Author": "murray johnson", "ReviewID": "R1RS3YKKPJ40QA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just wanted to give a little praise to the Mayday people.

All have been a pleasurable experience, but this HDX has exceeded all my expectations by far!  I was reluctant to get it as I only expected a software update and a few added gizmos.  I had hoped they would include another camera on it too, but no.What pushed me over the edge in purchasing it was a $50 coupon sent to me as a Prime customer, plus the knowledge I could sell my older HD Fire and recoup even more of the purchase price so it seemed to be worth a major software upgrade, all by itself.WOW!  Holy computational power, Batman!!!  I am more than delighted with this 7\" HDX!  The total difference between the older Fire HD generation one and this Fire HDX is amazing!  Incredible value here!  My only regret is that it doesn't support Flash, but neither did the HD unless you sideloaded Dolphin, and for the most part I can do without having Flash on it.  I do hope a software upgrade will enable Flash videos on it, and soon, but with the outstanding performance and speed of the HDX as it is, I can live without having Flash.  Besides, what a lot of people don't realize is, if you use any other OS (in order to view Flash) rather than the Amazon version, you lose all the great benefits of Amazon's cloud loading and storage, which is part of the reason for it's speed and super flexibility.This HDX is a true world-beater.  I can't imagine what even newer models could provide in addition except another camera on the 7\" model.  I have not used the Mayday help feature, but since I've used Fires from the very beginning I'm used to handling the OS.

I had over 400 books on my original, and they are there (in the cloud) or I can move them back and forth. I love having my Bible on my Fire, as well as several of my favorite cookbooks. I have even downloaded Craftsy classes and view those seamlessly as I sew right along! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE my new Kindle!!", "Date": "January 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best Kindle Fire Hands Down", "Author": "David Cripe", "ReviewID": "R1NWRE8PDA313L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this Kindle Fire HDX during the cyber-Monday special of $179, which was totally worth it as that price.  My family has owned the original Kindle Fire the past two years roughly, and this one is way above that version.  Is it better than the Kindle Fire HD version?  Depends, but probably not if price is your biggest factor.Pros:1) iPad Contender - Seriously.  The iPad in my opinion is way overpriced for what it does.  The Kindle Fire HDX is just as capable at handling most of the same work flow with a couple of differences.  Yes, this is tied to the Amazon App store.  If Google Play was standard, then Apple might be worried.  Right now though, Amazon is crippling their own success.2) Fluid Performance - Smooth as butter.  I have played around with everything available for the past two months and it handles it all with excellence.  Games, work, reading, etc run flawlessly (app issues not withstanding).3) Screen - Sharpest resolution I have ever seen on a screen this size.  Made the original Kindle Fire look like a 10 year old non-HD television.  I could stare at this thing for days (but won't).  Reading, movies, games, etc are shown in perfect HD resolution.NOTE - The blue pixel edge issue is there, but it is not distracting to me.  I actually kind of like it.  If you read a lot on white backgrounds, then it pops out more than normal.  The haze falls to the background after I begin reading the first page of something, and I never notice it much any more.4) Micro USB Connector - Bite it Apple!  :)  No cord carousal here.  If you have a cord sitting around, it most likely works for charging or connecting the Kindle Fire HDX.  For the first time ever - a plug adapter is included!  Amazon is including a plug adapter so you can actually charge the device through a regular electrical outlet.  What a concept Amazon!  That might catch on with other electronics (sarcasm).5) Bells and Whistles - This thing has it all (mostly).  Dual-band WiFi, HD screen, Amazon support (best in the world), light as a feather, etc, etc.Cons:1) Amazon App Store (sort of) - No Google Play?  I know Amazon wants everyone to use the device for their content, but not allowing one of the largest app stores on your Android device seems illogical.  I am able to use 3rd-party app stores to upload missing apps and outdated ones on the Amazon App Store, but still!2) USB Connection Port - The connection port on the device can be a bit of a nuisance.  You have to connect it at an angle on the device (around 30 degrees).  Just irritating to me for some reason as everything else has it straight, so your mileage may vary.3) Mayday Button Gimmick - I am a computer-savvy person.  I don't need help on where to press the power button or tweak the brightness.  If you are buying this for grandma or a person that never has used much technology in the past 10 years, then this is a life saver for you (no more annoying phone calls).4) Battery - I get a couple days of heavy usage (8 hours) out of it.  I just wish I could get the Kindle reader battery life of 4 to 8 weeks.  :)Overall:This is finally the Kindle to put Amazon in striking range of Apple on the tablet front.  If you crave everything Amazon like me, then it is a no brainer to purchase this.  If you are not, then buy it anyway as you will save at least $100 over the nearest priced iPad.  If Amazon would just switch to Google Play for the app store, then there is nothing that would stop them from ruling the world!  :)", "Date": "January 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire HDX 7\"", "Author": "Melissa", "ReviewID": "R22FZPHTPJ6OYK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "New owned a Kindle or a Tablet and got this for Christmas and I love it!

It fits the needs I require which are reading, movies, games, and browsing the web. I don't care for all the fancy technical stuff or connecting to TV at really, I'm happy as long as it does what I need it to do.", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great device but lacking output/apps for external devices (TV, Receiver)", "Author": "someone", "ReviewID": "R359D4Z06Q4KMD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There are many reviews for this device, but not much information about how to output the device display content to external TV/monitor. So, I'll share my experience with that part in case it could be useful for someone else looking for that functioanlity.I had this for few weeks, and basically can echo many other reviewers. Excellent build quality, display, Amazon apps. If you're planning to use this device just to shop, read, watch videos on Amazon (on Kindle display) I doubt you could find anything else even close. However, if you want to output the display or sound content to an external device like a TV it all starts to go downhill. I want to highlight these issues since I could not find any details on the web (except very few).For some reason, Amazon does not provide apps such as \"Pioneer Control App\" and \"Panasonic Remote 2\". These are essential for me to control my TV and receiver from Kindle, so I could use them as a workaround for at least playing my own music/video library. To make matters worse, there's no other display output (like DLNA, through the home network). Kindle does not have an HDMI port, and the USB port does not work as a \"Slim Port\". So, I tried the \"Kindle Certified\" NetgearPush2TV. A real dissapointing experience. I wrote a separate review for that. Apparently Amazon tech support (and Netgear support) does not know much about this (I spoke with at least 4 agenrts, if I remember correctly). All Amazon agents were great, but couldn't help. So, if you plan to use the Kindle for the following then you'll be dissapointed:1. Play music from Kindle to your networked (aka connected) receiver2. Play videos (from internet/Amazon Instant Videos and from your own library) from Kindle to a networked TV3. GPS (e.g. with CoPilot) --- Kindle does not have a GPS, which I realized after buying. My bad, not whining hereA modern high-end device like Kindle should provide this sort of basic functionality, in my opinion. I was surprised to learn these limitations (the hard way). There are apps for this sort of thing (e.g. Flips/iMediaShare) but they're far from perfection with many limitations. I tried very hard to keep the Kindle and find workarounds for the limitations mentioned above but I could not. So I had to return it.Since then I bought a Nexus 7. Only problem I have is that Amazon does not allow it to access Instant videos (I knew this before I bought it but still weird, because I can use any other device and don't see how Amazon makes money by blocking it. Kindle is really cheap, so, also hard to understand how they make lot of money by selling the hardware. So, I'm confused but there must be some reason other than just Amazon/Google rivarly). I don't watch videos very often (but my son takes care of that for me with his Kindle) so it's not a huge isue for me at this point.Again, you need to read this review very carefully since I did not attempt to highlight lot of good aspects of the device since others have already mentioned those; if the extra networking/navigation/output functionality is not needed for you then the Kindle is an excellent device.", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Lovely little tablet.

There is no way I could afford a new iPad and after using this, I don't think I would want one anyway. I use this primarily for reading, watching videos and movies, and occasionally surfing the web, so nothing terribly extensive. It suits my needs just fine, at a lower price point and makes me feel like getting an iPad would just be overkill for me. I purchased mine with the adds included and honestly it's not a big deal. They're not intrusive with whatever I might be doing on the tablet and if it bothered me that much I would just pay the $15 to have them removed. There are some deals that are exclusive to kindle fire owners which is pretty awesome and since I use amazon quite often for purchases, I don't mind a chance at snagging a good deal. There are plenty of apps to pick from (for my purposes anyway) like Facebook, Youtube, and a few games here or there. It's lightweight and easy to hold for reading while lounging around in bed and the movies I've watch show up in beautiful quality.

She lives 1000+ miles away so I could not help her with set up and it took her almost 3 weeks to get it set up, so she could use it. ( this was due to the fact that it was registered to me.) She was on the phone for several hours( at least 3+ hours and 3 separate calls ) with tech support before they figured this out. I understand that the registration process is intuitive for most generations BUT a simple fact sheet with a tech support phone number would have been very helpful. She had to hunt down the number, for herself. She was nervous when she didn't find anything other then the kindle, in the box. I concede that this might have prolonged the delay in getting it set up.

As much as I wanted to like it and use it, it's just not as convenient as the iPad. For one, getting music to it (except music purchased through Amazon) is a pain, requiring a file transfer app to copy from my iTunes library. From a usability standpoint, there are annoying compromises like: 1) I have to get my glasses and turn on a bright light to make sure I'm plugging the charger adapter in correctly, and then when I do, the connector is at an odd angle - not parallet to the unit, which makes it seem like it's less secure and more fragile; 2) the switch from portrait to landscape is sluggish; 3) having the power and volume controls on the underside are really inconvenient if you want to use it as a music play. The picture is great, but the Amazon-specific OS is a baffling decision by Amazon and indicates their priority is not user experience but on their ability to control the user's experience. The lack of apps and the quality of the apps is disappointing - still haven't been able to get the DirecTV remote app and the Chromecast app to work on the Kindle Fire HDX, whereas I have no problem with the apps on my iPad 2. The Kindle Fire is a perfect example of where comparing hardware for portable devices makes little sense unless you consider the entire functional experience with apps, controls, displays, menus, etc. In this respect Kindle falls short, IMO.", "Date": "May 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Older Versions are BETTER", "Author": "Shelly", "ReviewID": "R2X5Y34ZBVA5RS", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I like the new Kindle BUT the OLDER versions are much better.

But the time came to declare allegiance.  Music and video purchases are less and less dependent on hard media like CDs and DVDs and are becoming more and more cloud based.  Which cloud\u2026that was the decision to make.So Amazon came out with fireTV\u2026and I took the plunge and decide to go with Amazon for my video purchases.  I have been a prime member since its inception\u2026and it is the first place I go to when I am looking to buy something.  I love Amazon\u2026probably in an unwholesome way.With that decision behind me I was now free to find a device to take entertainment with me when I travel for work.  Do you have any idea how long and painful it can be to copy DVDs into digital files to take along when traveling\u2026I simply did not have the patience to convert all 14 seasons Dallas!  I needed a device that would hold a number of videos to get me through at least 2 weeks overseas at a time.  Reliable streaming overseas is generally not an option for a variety of reasons.And so I bought a Kindle FireHDX (64MB, no ads) and have been absolutely delighted\u2026I seriously couldn\u2019t be happier.  It is so FAST\u2026compared to my android ASUS transformer tablet.  The video quality is beautiful.  The sound is great and it is extremely simple to download videos\u2026even Prime videos\u2026to take along on my travels.Of course, nothing is perfect.  There are some disappointments but they are relatively minor.1) Battery life is disappointing if wifi is not disabled.  That has been my experience.  I will lose 15 \u2013 20% overnight if I leave the wifi on.  With the wifi off\u2026battery life is very good.  If there is an option to turn off wifi after being asleep for a while\u2026I don\u2019t know about it yet.  Long term, hopefully something like this will be developed in a software update.2) Lack of a mini HDMI out.  I like to plug my device into the HDMI ports of hotel TVs and watch my shows from the bigger screen.  When I realized too late that it had no HDMI out, I bought a Tronsmart miracast device.  It will work but not as smoothly or easily as a simple cable would.  I think the miracast is not quite ready for prime time yet.  It is not the end of the world if I can\u2019t hook up the hotel TV.  Watching directly from the Kindle works well.3) Apps\u2026need more.  I once had a Blackberry Playbook.  What awesome tablet that was\u2026really.  Fine quality device, perfect in every way\u2026except for the limited number of apps.  Amazon has to make this a priority.  And the apps need to work beautifully\u2026like they do on my iPhone (see, I said I had one foot in both camps!)4) Flicker.  I notice a disturbing flicker with one of my apps.  Haven\u2019t let determined if this is strictly a single app issue or if it will show up elsewhere.  I\u2019ll update later if it is more than just this one app.All in all I feel this was a most self-indulgent purchase\u2026it is such a sweet device and the perfect travel companion.

(I love the fact that i don't have to download my music to every device i own to listen to it)* it is a good price.* Some movies and books have a wonderful feature called X-Ray that gives you useful information. In movies it can tell you the actors and actresses on screen and what song is playing. If you click in the names out connects to imdb for more info.Cons*you cannot connect to the play store and the amazon app store is extremely lacking and/or outdated. You can sideload some apps but any that connect to google services wont work 100%. For example I sideloaded chrome and even though I can use it to browse i cant sign in to sync bookmarks with my computer and phone. I also got the youtube app and it worked but once again you cant sign in to see all your subscriptions. Gmail is compleatly useless...Etc...*There is a blue haze around the edges of the screen that is almost painful when reading. I ended up changing kindle reading settings to a night mode so it didn't bother me.*apps that had no problems on other tablets or phones seem less stable on the kindle. I bought a game on the amazon app store and it ended up blue screening the device which was surprising since i never had a tablet give me the blue screen of death before (but to be fair it hasn't had a problem since then )* battery life when watching videos is worse than my asus tablet* you don't see the date when you pull down the notification barLast thoughts*It is probably a good idea to add a password to the kindle because it is always signed into amazon. This includes their kindle books store, app store, music store, and physical product store. So if you have kids or fear it may get stolen a password is a good idea.

You Can't Use GOOGLE!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2OQ0Y3K72W9YR", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought my very first tablet, the Kindle Fire. I was so excited when it arrived. I put on the screen protector, put it in it's case, set it up with my acct information. I was in awe of the look and feel of it. It is beautiful! The picture and sound are amazing too. If you love Amazon, this is probably exactly what you want!I went into the situation blind. I read a lot of kindle books so I thought the Fire would be great. I didn't understand that a tablet would block you from using specific programs they deem competition. I use Google Music, I pay for unlimited music each month. It never occurred to me that I wouldn't be able to stream my music over my tablet! It doesn't make any sense to me! My HTC phone, which uses google, lets me download Amazon apps so why wouldn't Amazon let me use Google?!I went into chat with an Amazon rep to find out if there was anything I could do to get my music on it. They said no, they were sorry. They said I was free to buy music from them tho. Of course I am but I don't want to buy every stupid song that pops into my head. I'd go broke!And they don't offer anything like unlimited streaming that I could switch to.In looking through the kindle apps, I also learned that the Google apps that are offered (maps, gmail) had horrible ratings with comments that they don't work at all.I am a HUGE Amazon fan. And even through this, I am a loyal customer. But I am  so deeply disappointed. I am disappointed that they have chosen an isolationist approach to their product. Having my music available to me would not have taken any dollars away from them. I still would have bought my books and movies through them. Probably a lot more than I do now. I don't buy my music thru Amazon, I buy it thru iTunes. I always have and I always will. I keep my music on Google Music. I use the unlimited music to hear new songs so I know if I want to buy it or not. By not letting me stream music they've lost book and movie purchases. They never would have had much music business from me. Maybe some, bec I might be too lazy to use iTunes. The thing is, I have my way of doing things. I use many products. I don't want to feel contained or limited or be forced into changing for literally a BAD BUSINESS decision by Amazon.I wanted the kindle bec I thought it might be nice to use in the kitchen or around the house specifically for entertainment purposes. Reading, music, movies, tv shows. A sort of all purpose entertainment center. Like they advertise. What they don't say on their product page is that you won't be able to use Google services. It should be very specific for people like me who are new to the tablet world. I bought a case and protective covers and the warranty.  Amazon is charging me money for the returns and some of it can't be returned. I feel like they withheld important information and now I am paying the price for it.I did some research last night and decided to go with the second generation Nexus. It will stream music, allow Amazon apps and it has a cute keyboard.  They don't force me into using them exclusively!Amazon is really on the wrong side of this!!", "Date": "February 21, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$284.00", "Features": "NULL", "Name": "Kindle Fire HDX 7\" Tablet", "ImgURL": "NULL", "ProductID": "B00CYQPMJC"}}
