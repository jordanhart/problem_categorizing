{"Reviews": [{"Title": "My Thoughts (Typed Using The Kindle Fire HD 8.9)", "Author": "Rick Mallory Jr.", "ReviewID": "R2VX6G023G4D9Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me start out by saying that I am new to the tablet world and have had no experience using any tablets prior to this purchase. That being said, I spent a great deal of time fishing around through reviews and specs of what seemed like countless tablets for months. The obvious cliche conclusion led to all fingers pointing at some variation of an iPad, yet for me, I do not see much sense in purchasing a tablet (regardless of brand) for around the same price as a cheap yet descent laptop that will have more potential.Enter the Kindle Fire HD.I will spare you the story on my process of how I ended up choosing a Fire HD and get right to what you all want to know: my thoughts and experience thus far with the product.Picture: (10/10)I will start with this since obviously that was the first thing i noticed. In a word, incredible. Now its not \"eye popping\" or anything out of this world, but i can honestly say it exceeded my expectations and i was (and continue to be) impressed by this piece of hardware's capabilities. I tested out just a few minutes of  TV shows, trailers, videos, and films from Prime Instant Video, Netflix, Hulu Plus, Flixster, and Youtube (through the web browser since an app is currently unavailable) and everything looks as it should (and beautiful to boot)! Books come out crisp as well (both in text and picture) and the same goes for basic website visuals, apps, and games. Overall I am very impressed.Sound: (10/10)This is probably where i was most impressed. I have seen some of the reviews on here that are 3 stars or less putting down the audio or claiming they don't hear the big deal. Not to be a jerk or anything but i recommend those people check in at an ear clinic and have their hearing tested. I was literally amazed at how I was hearing sounds from various distances and angles. From up close it felt like i was hearing a high quality home theater system and not just for one flick but everything. From website audio to music, Netflix to Audiobooks, this tablet sounds great!Book/Reading Features: (10/10)At first this was not my primary reason for purchasing a Fire HD, but after toying around with a few things, I am truly impressed at how well Amazon has integrated the ability to find, purchase, read, and even listen to literature. The lending library for Prime users is a nice added touch allowing you to borrow from a rather extensive list of books. Not to mention many timeless classics are available for free (such as Dracula, Gulliver's Travels, Little Women, The Iliad, The Jungle Book and many more) and of those titles, many come with free audio! If you do not feel like spending the money on audio (or if your book has none available) the text-to-speech feature is surprisingly well done with minimal error. With all this being said, I can honestly say that I am excited to start reading again.Web Browsing: (8/10)The only reason I do not give this a 10 is because web browsing (with what is given out of the box) lacks Flash support which limits the capabilities. However, with a bit of research I was able to find forum discussions on how Fire HD users were able to work around this by downloading an app called ES File Explorer and then a separate browser called Dolphin that gives you Flash capabilities, so this is an easy fix that even a monkey could figure out how to do as long as they are patient. Though don't get me wrong, Silk is fast and beautiful and i use it for the majority of my web surfing, but occasionally Flash is needed. As I am sure you have read by now in other reviews, the fact that the Fire HD does not automatically come with Flash support is not Amazon's fault yet rather Adobe for pulling he plug on their involvement with tablets. Again, as long as your network is put together well, browsing the web is very fast and up to par with dare I say some computers.App Availability: (8/10)To me, this is the only area where the Fire HD lacks. I would rate lower here but I am trusting that over time and after updates, the lineup will have grown. Once more, with a bit of research you can find discussions on how to \"sideload\" apps from your computer and other devices, but that could be a bit too advanced for the average user. Though for what it is worth, the selection it does currently come with is top notch. Just to name a few, some important missing apps include: YouTube, Dropbox, and SiriusXM. Still, as far as I am concerned, this certainly is not a deal breaker and I am sure that as things progress access to these will become available.Look/Feel: (10/10)The 8.9\" model that I own and am currently reviewing was a lot lighter than I expected and it is true what they say ( it is just right to fit in one hand). Out of the box/pre-case the Fire HD looks great and is very thin, sleek, and dare I say...sexy? The only minor gripe I would have (that I noticed other reviewers mentioned) is the volume and power buttons are sometimes hard to find and do not always register, but after a while you get use to it. Aside from that, I love how it appears and functions.Overall: (56/60)There are a few things that by now you may know, such as how out of the box the Fire HD does not come with a wall charger. I know that is a bummer but if you don't already have one roaming around your house from a smartphone or if you cannot tolerate simply charging from your computer, Amazon sells them at a fairly reasonable price.Bottom line? I have purchased over 500 items on Amazon and I rarely feel the need to review a product, but I genuinely felt my voice needed to be heard ( or read rather) with the Kindle Fire HD 8.9. I strongly recommend purchasing this product and if you have any questions, feel free to comment and hopefully either me or someone else can assist you!P.S. This took me forever to type on the Fire HD but it was good practice and hopefully worth it!I would highly recommend a screen protector and a case", "Date": "November 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Value and Great Gadget", "Author": "Michael Gallagher", "ReviewID": "R1664MHMUTYIOH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Originally published in November 2012, Updated January 19, 2013 after using this Fire for several months...As there appears to be mixed reviews of the 8.9' Fires - ones with 4G access and those without - to clarify, this review is for the 8.9\" tablet with the 4G connectivity option.To get the iPad comparison out of the way, I put this tablet side-by-side to my iPad 2 I use for work.  Downloads were slightly faster and the video screen resolution and the colors were more vibrant on the Fire vs. the iPad 2.Screen Display / Video Playback:With the larger HD screen, if playing video is important to you this is the version of the Fire to get as the screen display is fairly impressive with sharp and crisp colors. The display on this HD Fire was one heck of a lot better in terms of sharpness than last year's model and even this year's smaller HD model.Amazon also added a cool feature on this one with the HDMI micro connection port. I have an HDMI micro plug and was able to hook this up to the big screen to watch an episode of the science fiction series Defying Gravity.  It played back great smoothly with no problems.Wi-Fi connectivity:My standard test for trying out new gadgets is to see how fast they run side-by-side with a known piece of equipment doing the same test at the best place of Wi-Fi in my house and the worst place where it drags. In this comparison, I had this 8.9\" version of the Fire sitting next to the \"smaller\" HD version of the Fire, my Motorola RAZR smartphone, my iPad 2 (yes, the Kindle guy uses an iPad for work), and the new 7\" Fire all just using a Wi-Fi connection vs. cellular connectivity..My website test is to hit the mobile websites of FoxNews, CNN, my personalized Yahoo page, Google, and the Houston Chronicle. The ones that were usually slow on the other devices and were still slow but faster than the other devices (Houston Chronicle and CNN), and for the other sites I couldn't tell a difference in speed at the location closest to my router. When I went to the slowest / worst reception location of my house, the speed did have a noticeable difference in the other devices as this one was slightly faster but for a casual surfer it is not noticeable nor does it hang.Email Setup:Email setup was very easy with the included email app for my main Google account - it took about a minute to input my email address and password information and I was good to go: sending and receiving emails was a snap, and when I sent a test message with pictures they displayed crisply.  I will tell you I primarily us an existing app called Enhanced Email that I received here on the Amazon app store for free vs. what came as standard with the Fire for daily use, and it was easy to use - actually better due to the larger screen size - with this version of the Fire. For those of you asking yourself why am I using the Enhanced Email program, the simple answer is like many of you I have more than one email account: you can quickly switch back and forth on the accounts with the tool. The lazy person in me appreciates that as I don't like getting out of the lazy chair once I'm settled in!Game Play:I do play a lot of games, but they aren't the heavy action / interactive games many of the kids play today.  For my test, I tried out several rounds of Words with Friends and a Majong derivative.  The display was crisp and the tablet was very responsive as it interacted over the WiFi network of my home to the game server.Sound / Music PlaybackDifferent than last year's model and the $159 this year's model, the two speakers are located in the back of the Kindle Fire in two not-noticeable ports. My test of this feature was cranking up Van Halen's Panama to maximum volume (I wanted to see if it could really play the guitar licks), and I would alternate covering one speaker up over the other: you have true stereo sound with no degradation of the sound that makes you think you are about to blow the speaker. However, the sound is not very crisp (the $159 Fire sounds better to me) as the sound is going away from you with the speakers being in the back.  With a cover on the Fire to protect it, that can be a problem.  It's going to take a little bit of getting used to having the volume controls at the top of the device.Reading Books:Reading a book was enjoyable and easy on the eyes with the larger screen: I appreciate being able to changing the default font to something else in addition to increasing the font size so I don't have to wear my glasses.  Turning pages is pretty darn easy - just tap the side of the screen to go to the next page or back a page, or you can swipe your finger across the screen to do the same.Bluetooth:Bluetooth setup was very easy. I tested this with audio in my car as well as an external keyboard.  From a music standpoint, there were no delays or skips with the connection, and it paired up in about 30 seconds; I hooked up a Motorola Bluetooth keyboard and started banging away with several emails.  Just make sure you give it a device name so you can recognize it and be recognized.Cellular Connectivity (This Section Updated 1/19/2013):The 4G connection is a lot like how I have heard one of my friends describe his relationship with a girlfriend: when things are good, they are real good and when they are bad, they absolutely suck.The same can be true for the 4G connection - it can be real fast when it wants to be fast, and you can be dead in the water in the strangest places.  For example, I can be out in the middle of the country and see a cell tower on the highway / frontage road, and the cell service is screaming fast and very convenient.  On the other hand, I can be in downtown Houston, the display says I have full cellular strength, and it just won't work - no Internet, no email, no anything.In other words, I have a love-hate relationship with it.Concerning the introductory data plan - the one where you pay a one-time fee of $50 for 250 megabytes of data per month for 12 months, I have mixed emotions about it, also.  I am not a heavy user of email or web surfing, I dislike video chat, and I don't download big files all of the time, so I initially thought the 250 meg per month limit would more than suit my needs.I was wrong.Why was I wrong?  It's all of the apps loaded on your Fire that auto-magically turn themselves on that constantly check the Internet for updates, apps like Accuweather and The Weather Channel, a few news apps, and Words With Friends.  The Weather Channel app had to be the worst: despite manually shutting it down, it would miraculously come back on and download maps, constantly check for updates and refresh said maps so frequently it chewed right through the month's allotment in a day and a half.No kidding.  And it's not a very good app, either, in comparison to Acccuweather so I deleted it.Bottom line is you need to watch the data throughput carefully, or you will go over.  I upgraded to the 3 gig per month plan, which is the same plan I have with my work iPad and seems to be enough.  That's $30 per month, so I wasted the $49.99 on the 250 meg per month plan (AT&T; wouldn't give me a refund even though I upgraded).Affordability vs. an iPadDollarwise, this version of the Fire whips the iPad when you stack up the annual cost of connectivity, 64Gb of memory, and the cellular (or not) models of the iPad.  The iPad's screen is slightly larger, but when I put it up against each other for the same things (web page, game app) I really couldn't tell that much of a difference.Overall, if you are looking for a larger tablet this one wins hands down.  With the full-features included with this model - especially the 4G connection - I believe this will be my go-to device, and I will no longer be carrying my e-Ink Kindle in addition to my iPad every day.", "Date": "November 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not the Greatest Tablet, but a Good One", "Author": "D. Carlson", "ReviewID": "R3IX0K0RPO803C", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I wasn't really in the market for another tablet, but my girlfriend ended up getting one for me so she got me on this one. I would like to say that this tablet reminds me of the first Motorola Droid smartphone that came out several years back. The phone jam packed a ton of bells & whistles into its hardware and software to give a lot of bang for your buck. This is what it feels like amazon has done with the Kindle Fire 8.9. They have put a lot of advanced hardware and innovative software, so for the average user, specially someone who absorbs a lot of media, you get a lot for the price. But just because you get a lot for the price, doesn't mean it is without its flaws. This is an updated version of my likes and dislikes, (my original analysis was a bit rushed, this is more detailed):LIKESBuild QualityI like the build of this product, it has good material design and durability. It feels nice in your hands and comfortable to hold with easy access to buttons. Since this is only 8.9\" and not 10 or 11 inches, it is easier to grasp and hold in one hand with an overall good aesthetic look and feel to it.SpeakersI have to say, the more I listen to it, the more I like the sound. The speakers are definitely a step up from the norm and probably one of its best features. They produce a full, rich, and very vibrant sound you can experience music and movies the way they were meant to be experienced. It is not a home theatre experience, but as close as one can get with a small device like this.ScreenThe display is very nice. I'm not sure if it compares with the clarity of Super Amoled or Retina screens, but it comes close. High screen resolution is not special to the Kindle, lots of tablets now have high resolution screens, some higher. What this screen has that other tablets don't is the anti-glare, which works well under sunlight and highly lit places, it's not something that seems advantageous until you work with a screen that doesn't have this.InternetKindle's Wi-fi and Silk Browser make internet browsing fast. I did a comparison with a Samsung and Apple tablet, and noticed that the surfing was faster, it wasn't a huge difference but it was noticeable. Streaming audio and video had a bigger and more noticeable difference, with the Kindle being very smooth, with fewer lags and dropped connections. This is key for me, I hate streaming content with pauses and breaks in loading, there is less of that in the Fire.Reading ExperienceIn my opinion, this is Fire HD's best feature, delivering a better reading experience than any tablet right now. This is no surprise as books are Amazon's claim to fame and where they excel and have always excelled. I don't know if you remember, but before Amazon was Amazon, they were the first online retailer for books. Before there was an iPad, there was the kindle. They have always been at the forefront of the book buying and reading experience, now especially digital books. I think I remember reading that the Kindle was the main reason Borders Bookstore went out of business, Borders said they just couldn't keep up with or match Amazon's delivery system.Now with this Fire HD, they offer even more advancements. With its X-ray for books, its 'reading view' that takes away messy images on a site leaving only text, `immersive' reading that lets you play an audio book while reading, whispersync technology, and better optimization of text, other devices can't match. Granted it doesn't compare to digital ink like on the original Kindle for me did the best to mimic actual reading, but as far as tablets goes its better than what is out there. If you are getting a tablet primarily for reading, this is gonna be a good choice.Amazon UniverseI have a love hate relationship with Amazon's Universe of services. I don't like how even though the Kindle HD uses Android, it is somewhat restricted. Also, they don't have as many apps as google or apple. But taking everything else into account, movies, books, music, prime lending library, prime movies, amazon is better. The big drawback is you have to own a kindle to fully enjoy their universe, which means if you own a kindle, you are limited from using other company's universe.Apps and other featuresAll the apps work fine, they start and stop as they should, nothing to criticize or brag about. The touch screen is smooth and responds good, though nothing like iPad...hate to say it but iPad thumps everyone on that, their touch and scrolling is very fluid and just feels right. I don't have kids so I can't really comment on the parental controls but from other reviews seems like something to have if you have kids. Can access email and everything fine.DISLIKESWhen it comes to bringing together the right mix of original and developing technology in a tablet, like the first Droid phone, Amazon did an admirable job. It merged a mix that most of us will enjoy and find useful. Although Amazon has put original elements that make this tablet worthy to compete in the tablet world, at the same time, they've done some things that make you question what they're doing.AdsThis is the most disliked innovation to hit electronics since the Windows phone (and I don't mean the Windows 7 phone, I mean its predecessor, which was so disastrous nobody heard about its release and was pulled from shelves within two weeks). Microsoft was smart enough to pull its mistake, Amazon seems to continue to run with theirs.No ChargerAs you have read in other reviews, this product does not come with a standard charger. I don't like that other reviewers excuse this by claiming it makes the product cheaper. Chargers are not expensive to produce so I don't think it makes the product cheaper, it gives Amazon more opportunity to recover the Kindle cost by charging $20+ dollars for an accessory that probably only costs a few dollars to make. Not sure how accurate this is, it's my own decision I've reached as it doesn't make sense not to include a standard charger adapter because for most people including myself, this is not a pc companion, rather a pc replacement. Without a real charger, it becomes a companion. Yes, you can buy one, but why make us do that.CameraThe Kindle Fire 8.9 only has a front facing camera. It is useful for video chatting, but not for taking pictures. If I want to take a picture of something outside myself, I have to point the screen in that direction, which means I can't see what I am taking a picture of or have easy access to the camera buttons, doesn't make sense.This is some of the qualms I have, nothing revolting.All in all, do I like this Kindle HD? Yes. Will I keep it? Probably. Do I think it is the greatest tablet in the world? In some respects, yes, in others no. Should you buy it? The answer is this is not an all-in-one, do everything machine that the likes of iPad claim to be. With this it seems like amazon focused on some key things, like watching movies, listening to music, surfing the internet, and reading books. The things they concentrated on, they made sure to go full force to give users the best experience they could. They are things that most of us average users are going to use a tablet for...email, streaming, social media, video, music, for what amazon focused on with this product like I said they did admirably.", "Date": "November 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good Value Given All the Features & Options", "Author": "Dean Pritchett", "ReviewID": "R3AX3V9UT4B1ZH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife purchased the new Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" for me and have to say it is definitely one of the more nifty devices, with lots of cool features and options. Before I talk about them, I'd like to say that I enjoy tech gadgets and I usually get my hands on the latest and greatest ones. Although, I don't buy everything that comes out, I do play around and keep myself up-to-date with what is out there. Also, I don't hook myself into a particular manufacturer. If a product is good, I will purchase, use, and tell people about it. If something better comes out, then I move on. This review will cover the Kindle HD as well as my experiences with other devices.DisplayThis tablet has a very nice and fresh looking display. The images are super sharp and everything looks crystal clear. It is easy to view on off angles, which is useful when me and my friends are viewing the screen at the same time or for using the device in presentations and meetings. The anti-glare feature is a nice touch, I can view it in direct sunlight without a huge loss in clarity. Granted, it's not as great as in dim light or shade, but it does the job.AudioThe audio was a huge selling point for me. Most speakers on laptop, netbook, and other portable devices like tablets and smartphones produce poor quality sound. You always have to plug in external headphones to really enjoy music and movies. That issue doesn't exist with the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" These speakers get loud, and with Dolby technology, produce an enjoyable experience. Again, this can come handy when you are listening/viewing the device with multiple people.Wifi/4GI really like the Kindle Fire HD's dual-band, dual-antenna Wi-Fi. It not only does a better job of streaming HD content, but it allows you to connect to more types of signals. WiFi routers vary, some are old and outdated, while others are newer and function better working on different bandwidths and frequencies. Kindle can connect to all the different varieties. This is very handy if you travel a lot like me and need the ability to connect to whichever random connections you can find in the moment.BluetoothNice, handy feature, I don't know why more devices don't have them. I can connect to my Bluetooth wireless headphones and walk around the house without being tied to the device. Also, I can have the Kindle connected to my other Bluetooth devices without having to be next to them. Not a deal breaker, but a nice feature.Silk BrowserSilk is a neat innovation in internet surfing. It predicts what links on a site you will navigate to, and downloads those pages b/f you click on the link. This increases the load speed of webpages. The concept is interesting, and it proves useful when you've lost internet connection, because if the pages were downloaded prior to you losing the connection, you can still navigate to them.AdsThis is the part of the Kindle HD I dislike; the whole ad concept is unwise. Not only does it come off unprofessional, it adds an unnecessary decision/step in the purchase process.  The price difference is not much, so Amazon should either price the device higher or just chalk up the cost. As a buyer, if ads are an issue, since your spending $300 - $500 on a device anyway, spend a little more so you don't have to deal with it...unless of course you like to be kept up-to-date with ads.Outside of the ads, this is a fantastic media machine. With the display, speakers, dual core processor, and graphics card, it is the good for gaming, music, movies, and video. Add to it the Silk browser and the dual band, dual antenna Wi-Fi, it also becomes good for internet browsing, allowing for better streaming of those games, music, movies, and video.Vs iPad 3The main advantages iPad has over Kindle HD 8.9\" are that iPad's Retina display gives its screen a higher resolution, but not by much. iPad 3 has both a front and rear camera, while the Kindle HD has only the front facing camera. Amazon says the front facing camera is HD, but I'm not sure what that means. The iPad has GPS which the Kindle HD lacks. The clear advantage for Apple is the number of apps. Apple phones and tablets have the most apps of any competitor.On the other hand, the Kindle HD 8.9 is a bit thinner, lighter, and smaller than the Apple counter part. iPad has only a single mono speaker, while as mentioned, Kindle has the Dolby stereo speakers. Kindle's screen is a 16x9 aspect ratio (like Movie and HDTV screens), while the iPad is 4x3. What this means is that movies will display larger on the Kindle, using the entire screen whereas iPad will display smaller, leaving bars along the top and bottom.For most people, the key distinction between iPad 3 and Kindle HD 8.9\" is the price. The Kindle HD is considerably cheaper, with the WiFi model costing $200 less than iPad 3's comparable model, and the 4G LTE costing as much as $230 less than iPad 3's 4G LTE (even the iPad 2 and iPad mini are more expensive than the new Kindle). Take into consideration the data plan, and you are saving another $150 in the first year with Kindle HD.Another disadvantage of the iPad is that you get the deliciously awkward pleasure of joining a cult that brainwashes you into thinking buying Apple makes you different, better, while offering an advanced product; when in reality they are like the million other Apple users, spending twice as much for a device that is rarely up to speed with current technology.Falling behind in technology is one of the main reasons I've strayed from Apple over the few years. The original iPod and iPhone were true innovations. You might even say the iPad was an innovation, even though it was simply an oversized iPhone, even using the same operating system. To make their products work smooth, Apple's uses highly specialized components in their products. This makes it difficult for their products to evolve as quickly. The initial iPhone was one of the last phones to make the switch to 3G. And even though 4G has existed for nearly 2 years, iPhone made the jump only a few months ago. Apple's prized Siri is just an enhanced version of Google's voice activated search, which came out 2 years prior to Siri. Now Apple is playing catch up with the iPad mini and Amazons already on its second generation 7\" tablet.Vs Google Nexus 10Before starting this comparison, I would like to point out a couple things. One, evaluating the Kindle Fire against the Nexus is more an apple's to apples comparison as they are both use the Android operating system. The Nexus is a 10\" tablet (hence the name), while this review is for the 8.9\" Kindle HD. Both companies have a 7\" counterpart with the Kindle HD 7\" and Nexus 7, though the comparison here is strictly between Kindle HD 8.9\" and Nexus 10.It is also important to note that Google is the main reason anyone is able to compete with Apple phones and tablets right now. They are the creators of the Android operating system that are used in majority of non-apple devices. Tablets like Amazon's Kindle Fire and Samsung's Galaxy Tab really owe it to Google's open source Android operating system for their ability to participate in the tablet market.Now that we have gotten that out of the way, let's begin the comparison. Both Kindle HD 8.9\" and Nexus 10 run version 4 of Android. However, Nexus runs the updated 4.2 Jellybean, while Kindle Fire HD runs the 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich (the names are silly, but they are memorable). It is important to note, the version in Amazon's tablet is heavily customized. The customization has its advantage and disadvantages. The advantage is Amazon can offer things such as parental controls that can limit what your kids can do and for how long. The disadvantage is there are restrictions on certain features like Google's Play store.As mentioned, Kindle HD is 8.9\", the Nexus is bigger coming in at 10.\" Both have a front-facing camera but only the Nexus 10 has a rear one, which is 5 megapixels. Both have HD displays with Gorilla Glass and micro USB & HDMI connectors for HD video output. Google's display is higher resolution (even higher than iPad's retina), while Amazon's display has the polarizing filter and anti-glare technology. Both Fire and Nexus offer stereo speakers, but only Amazon offers Dolby sound.As far as hardware, both boast a dual core processor, though Nexus is a little faster at 1.7Ghz against Fire HD's 1.5 Ghz. On the other hand, Fire HD has more storage capacity starting at 32GB and going up to 64GB, whereas the Nexus starts at 16GB and goes up to only 32 GB. Kindle HD 8.9 comes in both a Wi-Fi and 4G LTE version, Nexus 10 comes in only a Wi-Fi version. Kindle has the dual antenna and dual frequency Wi-Fi, I believe the Nexus comes in only dual frequency, not dual antenna.The Nexus 10 excels in that it has the NFC chip for device-to-device communication, GPS, and it is fully integrated out of the box with Google services like Maps, Drive, and Gmail. As mentioned, Amazon's modified Android places restrictions on some of these services. Also, since Google makes Android, it is highly likely that updates to the Android operating system will likely be released to Nexus devices before Kindle Fire devices.As it relates to price, like with iPad 3, Kindle Fire HD has the clear advantage. The Nexus starts at $399 while the Amazon 8.9\" starts at $299. The next model up for Nexus is the 32 GB version which costs $499. At that price, you can get the Kindle not only at 32GB, but with 4G LTE. As far as price, Kindle has everyone beat.ConclusionThese are the major players in the world of tablets today. There are other manufactures like Samsung and Acer, however, they don't offer an extensive ecosystem of apps, media, and services like Google, Apple, and Amazon. Also, as stated earlier, most tablets use Android's operating system, so aside from hardware size and features, they are going to offer an experience similar to the Nexus.The question that beckons is which one to buy? If you really like one company's ecosystem of services, the answer becomes less difficult - get that company's device. That is, if you like Amazon's Whispersync technology, Silk browser, Xray for books and are a Prime junkie, then go with Kindle Fire HD. If you are a fan of Google Play and their services, consider the Nexus. If you are diehard Apple, well, I don't have to say what your going to go with...though if you go with Apple, do it and be quiet. Don't be like the masses of Apple customers who feel the need to run around advertising to the world about how they own Apple. Ranting and raving doesn't make you cool, it just shows how childish and insecure your need for validation is. Although, you might think you are cool, we all laugh and talk behind your back.On the flipside, if you are not overly committed to any company's services and are looking for a good overall tablet for a good price, then the clear winner is the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\". Given the hardware specs, its focus on media, internet, and reading, and the price point, it is hands down the best value. In my opinion it is the most advanced, feature rich device for the price.I love technology and enjoy following its progression, I've really enjoyed sharing my thoughts about this so I hope you've found it helpful.", "Date": "November 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "We like it better than our iPad (please don't hate me)", "Author": "Bob Tobias \"Robert Tobias\"", "ReviewID": "RO3LEA2I4EWCY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We originally bought this for our daughter to use so my wife can get her iPad back.Let's start with the comparison...Size (and weight) matter - This larger version of the Kindle Fire is smaller, thinner, and a quarter pound lighter than the iPad 3.  Of course that means the screen is a bit smaller too, less than 1\".  However, the Kindle screen is breathtakingly clear and the weight difference, while it sounds small when you type it into a review or read it as you are now, is really noticeable after just a few minutes of holding the device with one hand while using it.Price - Another tiny difference is that the Fire is a couple hundred dollars less than a similarly configured iPad.About the Ads supported version - We never notice them.  They are only on the lock screen.Display - We like the Kindle display better than the iPad.  There, I've said it and hope I won't have to go into hiding.  It is clear and bright without making everything look like a comic book and shows up well in sunlight without having to turn the display way up (which means the battery won't drain quickly).Usability - I'm liking the Kindle interface more and more, compared to the iPad or \"Native\" android tablets.  The Kindle prominently displays apps used most recently and the ones I just installed in a side scrolling \"Carousel\".  Other apps are just a few taps away.  That's great for me and greater still for my young daughter (see FreeTime, below) since there's no hunting for the things I'm likely to want the most. The iPhone and other Androids I've seen do it the other way around.First use - First use was very straightforward.  I liked that it knew my name without me having to tell it.  First thing it did, after greeting me (by name) was ask for my WiFi password.  After that it took a few minutes to download updates.  When I clicked on the \"Apps\" menu it already had listed every Android app I bought from Amazon.  Same goes for videos, music, and books.  I realize iPad does something similar.  However, having used both, I feel the Kindle is easier.On the business side I can access my email accounts, including those in an Exchange server, with no problems.  Attachments, including .PDF files, Word documents, and Excel spreadsheets can all be read with no problems.Back to the fun stuff, YouTube, Netflix, and SmugMug videos stream flawlessly.  Pandora provides music without a hitch.  It connects to Bluetooth devices quickly and easily.The Camera - The front facing camera, designed for video conferencing, provides a clear image while the screen provides a vivid image of the person at the other end.  We ran some side-by-side tests with our iPad 3 and the Fire always performed better.  There is no rear-facing camera for taking snapshots and I figure that's what my iPhone is for.FreeTime - We love it!!! This allows us to limit the app's and sites accessible to our daughter.  For us it's as much to keep her from getting into confusing places that interrupt her activities and keeping her from things we don't want her to see.  This is so much nicer than handing her my iPad or Samsung tablet and dealing with the frequent frustrations from her stumbling into an application she doesn't understand.  OK, these are not so much child friendly as parent friendly but everybody wins in the end.The Missing Charger - One difference that could be important to some is that the Kindle doesn't come with a charger.  It does include a cable that you can use with any USB charger or computer you may have on hand.  However, if you don't have one of those then you will want to order a charger along with this.Remember at the start of this I said we originally bought the Fire so my wife can get her iPad back?  After using the Fire my wife prefers it and leaves the iPad to our daughter.  The only problem is I need to buy a second Kindle Fire because now I want one too.FIRST THING TO BUY after you get your Kindle: Best 100 Kindle Fire HD Apps (Updated With Top Apps for the Kindle Fire HD!).  It's a bargain at $0.99 (Free to borrow if you're a Prime member).  You can zip through, read descriptions for the mostly free app's, click on the ones that interest you, and have them installed right away.A NICE CASE:  A little while ago I got an Innovic Multi Functional Handmade Leather Zip Bag for iPad 2 and 3 16gb, 32gb, 64gb edition.  Turns out even though it's made for an iPad it fits the 8.9\" Fire HD pretty well.  (I've added a video showing how well it works with this Kindle along with my review for that case)  It may not be a perfect solution but given the limited options for cases right now, especially for the price (originally $11, it has as of this writing almost doubled since I originally added this to my review and is still a good value), it isn't a bad temporary choice.  (I had a chance to try the Marware Revolve Case for Kindle Fire HD 8.9\", Black and will be sticking with this one.)", "Date": "November 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "The Fire HD 8.9 essentials - the Ys, the FAQ and some comments", "Author": "A.

I am not a pro videographer and couldn't find a way to better focus on the screen and cancel out the screen reflections.Second, this is NOT a video review. It only illustrates the answer to one and only one important question: how do you get around the seemingly impossible to turn off 1-Click? This is how you do it:1 - Whether you are a parent or not, you must have parental controls turned on.2 - From the top settings menu select 'More...'3 - Select 'Parental Controls'4 - Change 'Password Protect Purchases' from the default 'OFF' to 'ON'The video illustrates the above, then shows how attempting to buy a book prompts for a password rather than immediately beginning to download it, which is what happens if you didn't do 1-2-3-4.____________________________________________________________BACKGROUNDWe own the original 7\" Fire and the 7\" Fire HD which is our daughter's favorite tablet now. In addition - we are a relatively large, gadget-using family - we own a Nexus 7, a XOOM, a Galaxy Tab and a couple of lesser known Android tablets. We used to own a first generation iPad and I have access and have used the latest 10\" iPad but only spent a few minutes with the 'mini'.These being said, I will break my review into 2 main sections, followed by some conclusions. I'll have a section on the Y's (as in why the Fire HD 8.9 and not...) which may be slightly subjective and a FAQ which should focus on the Fire HD 8.9 and I will try to make it as unbiased as possible and then I will insert my own personal comments and views concerning the product. I will not going to list all the features: pixel density, expected battery life or CPU speed, etc. because the exact specs are all listed and can be found at the product's page.____________________________________________________________THE FAQ - I am trying to be objective here but the last 2 answers reflect my own viewsQ: In what ways is the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 different from the Kindle Fire HD 7?A: Larger screen, slightly better speakers, heavier, costs more, can be purchased with a 4G option.Q: Does it come with a charger?A: No. A charger must be purchased separately. There is an Amazon branded charger but many generic chargers will do.Q: Besides the charger, what other essential accessories should I consider?A: You may want to shop for a case/sleeve/portfolio, a stylus, possibly a glare-reducing screen overlay and a screen cleaning kit.Q: What should be the first things I may want to do as far as setup is concerned.A: You may want to disable/password protect in-app purchases, set you favorite search engine if you'd like something other than Bing, set parental controls if you have children, password-protecting any content purchase and deciding which type of content they are allowed to access.Q: What can I set through FreeTime, as opposed to the 'regular' parental controls?A: You can set profiles for more than one child, set limits on the amount of time they can use the Kindle each day, specific time limits for specific activities (reading, gaming, watching videos) and you can add specific books, Videos, Apps that the child can access.Q: Is all the content I purchased through my Kindle Fire 7 or my Kindle reader, including Paperwhite accessible from the Fire HD 8.9?A: Yes and No. Any purchases from Amazon's Appstore, including books, movies, games can be accessed from any Kindle tablet and on any non-Amazon Android tablet that run the Amazon apps (Appstore, Kindle, etc.) if they are compatible with your device. Incompatible apps that were purchased, let's say, for the original KF 7 or the KF HD 7 will become available for the KFHD 8.9 if and when the publisher upgrades them to run on it.Q: How much storage is available on the 16GB model?A: 12.8GBQ: Can you make a compelling case for purchasing the 32GB model?A: Yes, IF you have a lot of non-Amazon-purchased content (music, photos, videos) that you do not wish to store on Amazon's cloud.Q: Is storage on Amazon's cloud unlimited and free?A: Yes for Amazon-purchased only. No for everything else.Q: Can I install 'third party' apps, not purchased from Amazon's Appstore?A: Yes. Under 'Device' set 'Allow Installation of Applications from unknown sources' to 'On'Q: Can I change my browser's search engine to anything other than Bing?A: Yes, you can do it from within browser's settings.Q: Is there a way to prevent 1-Click from ordering items as soon as I touch them?A: Yes. See the (poorly made) video and the note at the top.Q: Name the most compelling reasons for buying a Kindle HD.A: Easy access to all Amazon-purchased content, unique and very effective parental controls, great sound quality off built-in speakers, good value for the price.Q: Name the most annoying features that may drive you away from buying a Kindle HD.A: Sold without a charger, hard to get to buttons, fenced in inside Amazon's own 'ecosystem'.____________________________________________________________THE YsWhy should I pick a Fire HD 8.9 over a Fire HD 7 (+) or why should I prefer the Fire HD 7 over the Fire HD 8.9 (-)?+ Larger screen+ Slightly faster processor- Lower price- Lighter, more portableWhy should I pick a Fire HD 8.9 over an iPad (+) or why should I prefer the iPad over the Fire HD 8.9 (-)?+ Significantly lower price+ Excellent parental controls+ Easy access to all Amazon's content+ Amazon's cloud with free storage for all Amazon purchases+ Not fenced inside Apple's ecosystem- Larger screen- Access to Apple's store- Rear-facing camera- Siri- Not fenced inside Amazon's ecosystem- iPads come either black or whiteWhy should I pick a Fire HD 8.9 over a Nexus 10 (+) or why should I prefer the Nexus 10 over the Fire HD 8.9 (-)?+ Excellent parental controls+ Ability to play Amazon Prime movies (don't believe can get it on the Nexus)+ Amazon's cloud with free storage for all Amazon purchases- Comes with a charger- Runs Chrome, Gmail natively and all other Google Apps- Google Play, does not block access to Amazon's Appstore or Amazon apps such as Kindle- Google Now- Pure Android, sure to be upgraded as Android evolves- GPS, Near Field Communication (NFC)____________________________________________________________CONCLUSIONS, RATINGWe have our Fire HD 8.9 now and it's a good quality tablet, right at the top when it comes to quality, design, user interface (very top there) and to a good extent, features. If I was about to buy a new Kindle Fire right now I would probably go for a Fire HD 7. The HD 8.9's larger screen size is the only clearly distinguishing difference between the two so, if screen size matters, get the HD 8.9 but be aware that others make equally sharp-looking tablets with larger 10\" screens.The Y's section below seems to suggest my preference for the Google Nexus tablets or 'pure Android' in general and, yes, I do prefer them over Amazon's. But I am a minority of one in my family because everybody else prefers the Kindles. I actually prefer to see my younger kid use the Kindle Fire because of the exceptionally well done parental controls.In the end, iPads, Fires, Nexuses are all going to sell millions of units each. I can only hope that my review helped at least some of you who invested time reading it decide what's best for them.", "Date": "November 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "I LOVE the Kindle Fire 8.9\": A Detailed Review", "Author": "J. Friedman \"JF\"", "ReviewID": "RM0EJRMDXSQ9W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As I did with my review of the 7\" version of this device, I had the chance to check out my friend's advanced copy of the 8.9\" version as well. My conclusion? Simple: I LOVE this device. GO OUT AND BUY IT NOW!!!! You will not be disappointed!!!I am a former Apple fanboy; I had the iPhone, I still have the second generation iPad; but now I am finding myself expanding to other, less expensive options. I now have the Galaxy S II, and am seriously considering switching to this product. You'll find most of my comments similar to the review of the 7\", with a few exceptions.DESIGN - I really like how the shortcut bar switches to the right side of the screen when you turn it to landscape mode, so you won't have to look for them. Landscape mode already uses up more vertical space so putting these buttons on the bottom in landscape mode would be silly. It's a bit weird that the home button is now on the right instead of left, but hey, that's fine with me as long as you're not using my landscape space.Attachments download pretty easily. Once you get the hang of things, you'll be using it in no time.FEEL - The fire HD 8.9 was designed very well this time around. So much easier to hold one-handed than a 10 incher or the even bigger 11.6\" guys that weighs down your hand. It has a fairly large bezel which does not look so great aesthetically (I would rather have an edge to edge screen with only a tiny bezel for holding, but I'll live!) It has a soft touch back which looks very pleasant. wider bezel as I noted before, and is extremely light. It is somewhat thick - definitely thicker than the ipad, but the 8.9 version feels just right. It weighs 20 oz. so it's the heaviest product in the Amazon kindle repertoire, but it offers the most so that is expected.It is bigger than the original fire and has nice curved edges which makes it much easier to hold than the original fire. It looks very sharp!!! It has volume buttons, a MAJOR improvement on the original fire as well. It is bigger than an iPad mini and feels bigger too - while still keeping a similar price point as the regular iPad but with far more options.SOUND - the sound is clear and fantastic and comes out very crisp. The fire uses dolby digital audio which comes out very clearly. Dolby knows what they are doing. The music plays very nicely and can be stored in the cloud which is great. Amazon allows you to import up to 250 songs which is not very much, but what can you do?SOFTWARE - the device has new programs such as x-ray which is great to learn more about books and movies, and FreeTime which is fantastic for kids.The platform is Android 4.0, but this is Amazon's customized version of the platform. It is based solely to sell products so don't think of this device primarily as a iPad replacement - folks, think of it more as a faster way to line amazon's pockets with other purchases that you will almost certainly make through the device. The home screen is not customizable with widgets, live wallpapers, weather apps, etc., the way an android screen is.Immersive reading is a new feature that allows you to play an audiobook while reading the screen - you can read and listen at the same time, or if you're bored with reading, just listen. I love having the option. They do well with the sound here using the new Dolby digital feature - that is just super neat and not expected in a tablet!While x-rays for movies is super cool, I got bored of it quickly. I enjoy learning about interesting features of the movie, but after the first time, I just want to enjoy the movie.The idea of FreeTime is great for my kids. My daughter can play with her games, and I know she is not doing other things because of the bright, vibrant blue background color of the screen which I can easily ascertain with a quick glance. I can lock them down on time so they can share with each other. Most importantly, the new fire HD is built tougher.The browser runs very nicely. It seems to run faster than the original fire did. I can turn full screen on or their new \"reading view\" which eliminates all the background junk that wastes space. I was able to download and load PDF files and some of my word documents without any issues, and I'm told by my friend that he had no issues loading his exchange server for work on the 8.9 fire HD.Movie and book titles show up the same way the original fire did, in a library look which seems to work well for Amazon's needs. It displays your titles easily and clearly and allows you to find what you are looking for quickly. The whispersync feature was a great idea - it lets you access your content on any device, so I was able to download a book on the fire HD and see it on my original kindle fire and my iPad's kindle app. Now they have whispersync for movies, games and audiobooks as well!!!!You can use skype which works fine on wifi - it's integrated but is not as full featured as their desktop app. You can also check email - they allow access to aol, gmail, etc. Facebook is set up with the device, and you can easily view photos as well. In short, it's a pretty full featured tablet just as all the others on the market, but at a fantastic price point.HARDWARE - The 8.9\" version costs $299 and $369 respectively (add $15 if you can live with special offers), as well as 32gb and 64gb ($500/$600) with LTE, plus you can get a fantastic 250mb data plan for only $50 a year on the LTE version. As my previous review noted, the 7\" kindle HD comes in 16gb (only $200!!!) and 32gb for $50 more. So you are getting a pretty fantastic deal. In comparision, the 64gb version of the iPad is $659 not including the data plan, so you're saving some money on this guy. Additionally you get 5 gb of amazon cloud storage free, plus you can pay more for more cloud storage (for files: 10/20gb, $25/50gb, $50/100gb, $100/200gb, $250/500gb, and $500/1k gb, plus for music: free/250 songs, and $25/250,000 songs).The data plan, if you get the LTE version of the 8.9\" fire HD, blows away the competition. Consider any smartphone you own - for instance a Galaxy S 2 - you have to pay at least $10 a month premium for the data plan alone, and this is only $50 a year! Not to mention the data plan includes 20gb cloud storage and a $10 Amazon app store credit!It has dual band wi-fi with 802.11 a/b/g/n that makes it much faster than the competition. It also has an amazing screen and dolby digital sound! It can handle WPA2, WEP and WPA security. The processor is a speedy 1.5 Ghz dual core processor with 16 gb integrated flash memory, which is almost as fast as my desktop PC... time to upgrade... :)It is a capacitive touch screen with fantastic resolution. The video playback is 720p. The device also has Bluetooth (A2DP) and HDMI port, as well as text to speech which is great for my blind friend. It comes pre-registered to my account which is a good and a bad thing. I have to be sure not to give it to anyone else without undoing that! It also has a USB 2.0 and 3.5mm stereo jack. It has an accelerometer and gyroscope and front facing HD camera with built in microphone for Skype! It also has an ambient light sensor as well which is a fantastic feature.As noted in my other review, I was able to check out the cover for the 7\" (haven't seen it for the 8.9\" yet) which has a nice leather grain. The interior is made of nylon which has a bit of a plasticky feel. I love the iPad 3 magnetic locking feature and they seem to have utilized that here which turns the device off (sleep) when you close it, and turns it on when you open it. Simple. Uncomplicated. I assume the cover is the same for the 8.9\" version.SCREEN - They have reduced the screen glare on the device using IPS technology, a polarizing filter and anti-glare, which is pretty nice. IPS is a big deal as you don't want to be looking at it from a sharp angle and not be able to see the screen. I don't have as much trouble seeing it in direct sunlight. Also, the screen is much sharper and crisper than the original fire. I can lay the screen down flat on the table and still see what's being played pretty well. The color is vibrant and the magazines show up fantastic similar to the iPad's retina screen. It has vibrant blacks and a display resolution of 1920 x 1200 which is about 255 ppi so that does lag a bit behind the iPad with retina display.PERFORMANCE -  The HD 8.9\" seems to run a bit more efficiently than the 7\" version that I tested earlier, and it certainly runs much faster than my current kindle fire. It has a hardware called MIMO (multiple input/multiple output) which is increased antennas that work together to transfer data and improve data performance without taking up more unnecessary power or even adding any bandwidth to the spectrum! It uses all antennas provided to improve the connection quality as well. Not only that, the processor needed can be the same one without requiring an updated one.Downloads are pretty fast. I have Prime so I am able to run movies and shows for free and they ran fantastic on the device. On Wifi they just scream OWWWWWWW FAST. Much better than the iPad 3 as I've cross tested them. Netflix and YouTube ran seamlessly with no stuttering as sometimes happens on wireless devices like the iPad. I was able to get about 8 to 9 hours of battery life with VERY heavy usage, a bit less than the 7\" version since I had the LTE running, I think they say over 11 hours but that did not happen for me. It charges pretty fast - it took only a few hours using their \"powerfast\" charger.ADVERTISING - The device DOES have advertising, which is displayed on the lock screen only. I found this did not bother me too much, but now Amazon allows you to pay $15 to turn this feature off. If you care so much, then you probably should not be wearing that shirt with the polo logo on it. I'm sure most of you don't and would rather spend that $15 on a new app for the device.OPENING THE BOX - It has a USB 2.0 cable and the quick start guide, as well as the tablet itself. I wish it came with the power adapter up front. I would have to go out and buy one - the iPad comes with one so why not this device? I would rather pay the extra price up front, although I guess it's better to have the option than the choice made for me. The micro-USB cable is nice for plugging it into the computer. No headphones, although I just plugged mine in from my iPad and was fine.WARRANTY - this comes with Amazon's 1 year limited warranty but you can buy a 2 year warranty as well.ACCESSORIES - You get a $3 mp3 credit with any kindle accessory you buy, so that's a bonus. You can and probably should buy two products with the device. Most importantly, pick up a powerfast charger which allows for superfast charging in only 4 hours and costs $20 which is not unreasonable. Amazon Kindle PowerFast for Accelerated Charging (for all Kindle Fire models, not included with device). I did not get a chance to see the cover for the 8.9\" but I DID see it for the 7\", so I assume they are very similar. You can get it here for about $55 Amazon Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" Standing Leather Case, Fuchsia (will only fit Kindle Fire HD 8.9\") which is a bit pricey but attaches magnetically, will wake and put your iPad to sleep, and serves as a built in stand.CONS - Very minimal issues - no charger included. No microSD port. No rear camera (most have dual cams now). But let's consider these things - you save money with the absence of a charger - remember, Amazon is already selling these at cost. If you have any USB charger (most people have a smartphone so you can reuse that charger if it's USB), you'll be fine. No rear camera is fine - you aren't holding a larger device like this at all times and if you really need to take a photo, you'll have your smartphone or camera for that. The only real negative I found was the lack of a microSD port, but given that Amazon is generous with the significant memory capacity of the 8.9\", this isn't a desktop replacement so you probably wont need to use up all of that storage.Conclusion - Price is great in comparison to the competition (i.e., the iPad) but you may still want to get a charger and almost certainly a case to protect your baby. Definitely a worthwhile buy if you are looking for a functional tablet and you want to be at the forefront of the technology line. I LOVED IT and recommend it!!!I hope you enjoyed this review. Please feel free to post any comments and I'll be happy to answer!***UPDATE 11-19-12 - Still loving it. I play with it every day. Noticed that the browser does predictive linking. Cool! Screen is super clear and immersive - those pixels are put to great usage and the IPS with a variety of angles is simply fantastic (although it's included with many devices, it's still a great feature for those not used to the future of tech!).  Gotta love that x-ray tech - it's so nice to download something on my kindle then switch to my phone when I dont feel like holding it, without having to redo everything. Makes life SO much easier! Amazon, you're a blessing!******UPDATE 11/23/12-have been playing with it for a few more days and i am still very happy with it. When I'm on wifi, movies load super fast and snappy, even better than the 7\" version. It seems like the wifi is just much better on this model. Also, when watching movies, the sound is fantastic and crisp, due to the speakers on each side, almost like surround sound! One thing you should know is that the device does have a tendency to get a bit warm, nothing extremely unusual, pretty typical in fact but you should just be aware of that fact. Minor issue. Still love it and reccommend it!!!******UPDATE 12/17/12 - Sorry this is a bit behind the 8-ball but better late than never!!! Just so you are aware, Amazon has posted an update for the Kindle. Doesn't work on the lower end models. This is the text of the update taken from the forums: \"We have a new, free software update available for Kindle Fire HD and Kindle Fire Second Generation. The software update will be delivered automatically via wireless to your Kindle in the coming weeks. These software updates will include: *Kindle FreeTime, a tablet experience just for kids allowing parents to set daily screen time limits, and give access to appropriate content for each child. *A setting so customers can control whether or not personalized recommendations appear below the carousel on the device homepage. *Ability for customers to set the default device language to one of six languages, including English (US), English (UK), German, French, Italian, and Spanish.

If you have any questions related to this release, please visit the Kindle Help Forum - http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/forums/kindleqna/ref=kindle_help_forum_gd.\"", "Date": "November 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Bad experience", "Author": "Mark", "ReviewID": "R1WN5L92AX76A6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Since I am getting so many rude comments, I decided to delete the issues and problems I had with this unit.  A little background on myself; WAN Tech, Project Manager for 3 major Internet providers and a telecom specialist for 15 years.  I had purchased the Original Kindle fire and love it.  You may search my reviews to see that I am credible.I am currently on my 3rd replacement of the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 with 64GB.  The current unit is working, but the previous two had major issues regarding WiFi/4G connectivity and memory problems to the point where the units were useless and had to be replaced.I would not recommend this unit for the following reasons....1) Many android apps on the Amazon store do not work, or harm the unit. For example the app called \"Locate my Kindle\" (now removed by Amazon) has harmed over 130 kindle fire units.2) It appears that memory management software may be, or has been defective.  Hopefully the last update has cured this.For a synopsis of the memory problems I had with unit number 2, you may visit the kindle forum at the Amazon link below ....http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/forums/kindleqna/ref=kindle_help_forum__rvt_np?ie=UTF8&cdForum;=Fx1GLDPZMNR1X53&cdPage;=2&cdThread;=TxBRLZ21QQBP22#CustomerDiscussionsNew==================================Now that my third Kindle Fire HD 8.9 64GB is working, I feel I can write a full review of what I like and don't like.1) Email Support.  The embedded email app works well.  I use the MSN Outlook platform, and it even supports multiple sub email boxes.  This is better than the Kindle Fire Original app. 4 of 5 stars.2) Music.  The music app is fine.  However it does not let you add a new song to one that is playing like the Original Kindle Fire.  However, the work-around for that is simply to play a song, then while listening to it, build a new play list.  You can sort by Albums, Artists, and Songs. 3 of 5 stars3) Sound.  The sound of the internal speakers is ok.  The Amazon marketing department use words such as \"Booming\".  No, they don't boom.  They are loud enough for two people to watch a movie without headphones.  They do have good stereo separation thanks to Dolby.  However, if you really want a good experience with sound, get yourself a very good set of ear buds and enjoy, then, and only then, does the Kindle Fire HD actually BOOM.  2 of 5 stars4) Movies.  I have to say that this was the whole reason I got the 8.9 64gb unit.  And, I have had nothing but problems in this area.  But (cross my fingers) I hope third time is a charm.  So, lets say it like this .... When the unit is working well, the screen has excellent resolution when playing movies.  You can download them from the Amazon store with different resolutions depending on the quality of playback you want as well as how much memory storage you have left.  3 of 5 stars5) HDMI Output.  This is a new feature and I do like it.  However, be very careful when looking at cables for this.  The first one I purchased was HDMI rated, but the video quality sucks with it, even though I downloaded the movie in the highest definition.  I would buy one that said HDMI with HIGH SPEED.  That should be the best one.  4 of 5 stars.6) Video Quality.  The screen on the HD unit is good.  When displaying icons for music and menu functions, it is totally clear and easy to read.  When watching an action movie, the screen keeps up with the fast moving scenes quite well.  Further, there is an auto-dimming function that works really good with my 3rd unit, that didn't work well at all with my first two units. 5 of 5 stars.7) Amazon App Store.  Apps are limited and have a much lower selection than those available for other Android tablets.  Further, apps that work on other android devices simply do not work on certain models of the Kindle Fire (such as the HD).  However, if you read the reviews, most of the time you'll be fine.  But, don't expect that just because an app is in the Amazon store that it wont harm your Kindle Fire.  There is some history of damaging apps that are on or have been on the Amazon Store.  I suggest reading the reviews carefully before downloading ANY applications for the Kindle Fire HD.  0 of 5 stars8) Amazon Tech Support.  I work during the day, so I have found that when I call in for technical support I usually get someone that is from another country and has a difficult time understanding what I am saying, or I get someone else in the USA that doesn't have any technical knowledge at all.  So I would have to say they simply don't have any technical support that is any good at all.  Further, if you are a tech head like myself, and find a problem with the unit, the really only viable option is simply sending it back and purchasing another one.  To get an exchange is next to impossible without using colorful metaphors. 0 of 5 stars.9) WiFi Wireless.  Simply awesome!  They really did their homework on this function and they deserve to use all the really dramatic marketing buzz words they wish.  It simply is really good, it works from a long distance, and is quick to sync up with a network. 5 of 5 stars.10) AT&T; 4G.  Not as good as I had hoped.  First of all, if you leave your 4G on, you wont have much battery life left is just a few hours.  So, some of the really cool texting apps are out of the question when using the 4G.  Further, when you turn it on, it can take 2-3 minutes to sync up, sometimes even longer.  It seems to bounce around from the regular AT&T; network and the 4G as if it didn't know that it only should work on the 4G network.  Although I do like the promotional plan they give for $50 for one year because it seems to be great for me if I am just checking email, facebook or my stocks.  2 of 5 stars11) Silk Web Browser.  When this came out for the Original Kindle Fire, there was a lot of hype about the Silk browser. Personally, I think it was, and still is just that, hype.  The browser is slow to launch and will display that its ready, but then you start to type something and it isn't.  Only a few seconds later you realize that you typed your UserID and Password to your bank and the Silk browser wasn't actually in secure mode - which is a little alarming.  Sometimes the Keyboard doesn't show up when you want it to, and sometimes its just slow to show up.  Also, if you are new to Tablet browsing, realize that Flash is no longer supported.  Although there are work-arounds for that (side-loading a different browser), be prepared to start getting a little more tech savvy in regards to that.  3 of 5 stars.12) Battery Life.  Its not so good.  I have really learned to use the Airplane mode which shuts off the WiFi and the 4G antennas from searching for a network, when I know there isn't one.  Also, if I leave on the WiFi and 4G, the other choice is simply to power down the unit.  The only problem with that is that it takes a bit to power back on.  If you are looking for a battery application, I would advise against the Free Battery HD app.  I had a lot of problems with it and do not recommend it.  2 of 513) Amazon Shopping.  I have not had the best experience in the last several months with Amazon shopping.  This hasn't always been the case.  However, in the last 4-6 months, I have returned about 30% of the items due to issues with the items.  You are welcome to view my reviews for more details on those.  Suffice to say, I avoid Amazon shopping unless there are absolute glowing reviews AND the item is a good value.  Otherwise I shop elsewhere.  Further, the merchants have been quite rude.  Several have tried to bribe me to change my review with cash. I suppose if they didn't have ethics when they shipped me a defective item, there would be no reason for me to think they would have ethics later.  Suffice to say I did not accept their bribe - the negative reviews stand.  0 of 514) Camera.  It comes with only one camera that faces you when you look at the screen.  This is good for Skype.  You can still take photos with it (get an app), it just takes a little more mental coordination when shooting scenes. But I have shot photos that way and it works pretty well. It would have been nice to have two cameras though.  3 of 5 stars.15) Sync/power and HDMI receptacles.  The placement of the these probably has to do with a future accessory stand.  However, depending on the design of the optional case you purchase, you may not be able to keep the unit charging while viewing it, especially in landscape mode while watching a movie.  4 of 5.16) Power and Volume Buttons.  The power button on the Original Kindle Fire actually lit up and depending on the color, you could tell if the unit was fully charged, or was charging.  This does not have that function on the button itself.  Further, the button protrudes from the unit, which makes it easy to accidentally turn off.  However, some of the optional cases actually help with this problem.  The volume button is a new addition to the Kindle Fire.  With the Original Kindle Fire, you had to used the on-screen volume in order to change the volume.  This wasn't always compatible with some apps.  So, this is a good addition. 4 of 5 stars.17) Included Accessories.  You get a nice cardboard box and a sync cable.  You can buy the Amazon Charger with the unit for a discount.  The retail is around $20, but when you buy it with the unit its about half price.  The charger is mandatory.  My personal opinion is that it should be included especially for the price that we are paying for this 64GB unit.  The optional charger (which really isn't an option) does not come with a sync cord, you use the sync cord that came with the unit.  Since I mentioned the box, I would make sure and keep it if you have to return the Kindle Fire. 0 of 5 stars.18) Blue Tooth.  I have re-written this section of my review. The blue tooth function is poor.  It seems to drop blue tooth functionality quite often, no matter what the Blue Tooth device is.  This is especially a problem when running the skype application with a blue tooth headset.  I have tried this with the Kinovo and the Rocketfish headset, but both drop about 20 minutes into a call and can not be reestablished unless I completely do a hard reboot of the Kindle Fire.  Obviously there is some sort of a software problem with the Blue Tooth.  Hopefully this will be resolved in the future.  0 of 5 stars.19) Value.  When my #2 unit failed due to memory issues, I did take a hard look at the options out there for other brands.  This unit is unique because it has some nice options that others don't especially if you love movies like I do.  As an independent telecom project manager, I have a history of flying around the country working with my clients on their WAN projects.  This unit does especially well (when the Kindle Fire itself is working) with Email (great for work and home email accounts), playing HD movies (Entertainment; because of the larger screen and extra memory storage), music, and access to documents on the cloud.  That boils down to a large HD Screen, cloud storage, and the large internal storage (64GB).  Further, when I can't access the WiFi network, I can switch to the AT&T; 4G network to get email.  Those features on the IPAD Mini still cost more than the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 4G 64GB.  Further, the next popular choice would have been the Nexus 7, but the internal storage is half of the Kindle Fire.  And although its about half the price, that simple doesn't suit my needs.  So, I'd have to say, as long as all the features of the Kindle Fire actually work as advertised, its value is 4 of 5 stars.All the ratings I have given are my honest opinion with the 3rd unit that is working (but still having issues with Blue Tooth).  My overall rating is still 1 star since I purchased the unit over two months ago and I have finally got a unit that is working. And for those that don't like negative reviews, I am sorry.  I write my own personal review the way Amazon intended so that people can read my experience and determine if it will work for them.  Simply writing glowing reviews without any attention to detail never helped any future customer.  And although I have been accused of not actually purchasing a Kindle Fire HD, please note that this is indeed a verified purchase.  And for those still intent on shooting down the author of a negative review by insulting my credibility,  please realize that I am in my late 40's, I am a telecom and network specialist and have worked as a project manager for no less than 5 major telecom companies.  Suffice to say I've been around computers for a very long time.Absolute Essentials to buy with the Kindle Fire1) Home Charger.  Find it at this link: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006GWO5WK/ref=oh_details_o00_s01_i00You cant fully charge the HD without it. 5 of 5 stars2) USB Charging Cord.  The cord that comes with the unit from Amazon is ok, but if you want to keep charging the unit while in landscape mode with the rooCase (see below) you need a USB cable that has a right angle to the left.  I've tried a few cords like this, and this is the best one that is durable and is rated for the higher voltage charging. The right angle to the left is important so as to not get in the way of the HDMI port.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AJCC2TQ/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1  .  5 of 5 stars3) rooCASE Origami Dual-View. Find it at this link: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0097FLMVK/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00The case is needed to protect the unit, plus offer multiple viewing angles. 5 of 5 stars4) ReVIVE Series DualFLUX DC to USB Rapid Car Charger. Link: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005OTESFK/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00The car charger provides the higher power needed to charge your Kindle HD while on the road. 5 of 5 stars5) Silver Executive Stylus Pen 2-in-1 Combo for Business Professionals.

Quite good! 5 of 5 stars", "Date": "December 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazon Kindle HD 8.9\" Makes Boredom Extinct", "Author": "Gregory S. MacBeth \"\"Be polite, be profes...", "ReviewID": "R7QCK5G4MM6BQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned two Kindle devices one of which was the original Kindle.  Both of which I have been very happy with.  If you are planning on buying a tablet for e-reading and want some of the benefits of a tablet (Web, email, music, or videos), then the Kindle is the best way to go.  If you are buying a tablet for business purposes primarily, then you would be better served with a Nexus 10 from Google.For personal use, the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\", is the best device on the market this Christmas 2012.  It provides the perfect balance between hardware to power use, which allows the user to have a device that runs for a long time, 10 hours, for reading, music, videos, and games.  When you add in the power of Amazon Integration, users are blessed with vast sources of books, music, videos, and games/apps that will make becoming bored nearly impossible.Reading Books:The typeface is amazing on the new Kindle Fire HD.  There is no eye strain and the controls easily allow you to change the font type, size, margin, and background colors.  Outside, the screen displays the page easily in full light of day with no glare.  Amazon didn't include any frills such as page turning animations like you see with the Google Books or Nook, but never the less, turning pages is easily done with a swipe.  Highlighting is easily done and seen by the viewer.  Buying books is simple and can be completed by any educated person.  The size of 8.9\", in my humble opinion, is the perfect size.  It allows you to see a real page of text from a book, which is great because it gives you the actual feeling of reading from a book.  Whereas a 7' screen never really shows you an actual page of text .  A 10.1\" screen will show you a screen of text on a page but it is slightly harder to hold in your hands.The only real downside is that Amazon continues to use their places rather than actual page numbers in many books.Music:The devices comes with two great speakers which allow you to play your favorite tunes loud enough to hear in almost any venue.  The Amazon Music store offers great deals with $3, $5 and discounted music on any genre of you desire.  You can make playlists to organize your tunes easily.Video:With a 1080p HD screen supporting a resolution of 1920 x 1200 you will enjoy movies all your movies and if you are an Amazon Prime customer, many will be free.  The Amazon store offers a wide range of movies for all interests.  If you can't find it in the Amazon store you can always use Netflix, Hulu, HBO GO or Youtube.Web/Email:You easily browse the web using Amazon proprietary browser Silk or you can download Firefox or Dolphin.  With these choices you can access almost any site with the exception of parts of sites that use Adobe Flash which is no longer supported on Android after version 4.  There are also apps for accessing your email which provide access to almost any provider.  Please understand that if you are a power email user, you will have to use the browser to access full GMail functionality, which is easy to do.Apps:One of the first things you will want to do is disable the feature that allows only Amazon store apps.  This way you can put apps like Nook or Zinio on your Kindle Fire HD.  Now you have a fully functional tablet...  But seriously folks, the app store is not as full as Google's store but for most major apps if they exist in Google's store, they will be published in Amazon's store too.Hardware:In general, the device feels solid in your hands.  It weighs in at 20 oz which is a little heavy.  The speakers are nice quality and sound clearly when used with clean country music or distorted head banger styles.  The 1.5 GHz Dual core processor is more than enough to power this device for personal use as an e-reader or personal web browser and email.  It powers the music and video with great quality giving the user High Definition on a 8.9\" screen.Screen:The screen is amazing in that it is brilliantly colorful, has a great resolution, and is easy on your eyes during reading.  With a resolution of 1920 x 1200 you will easily be able to watch videos in full HD brilliance and to be honest anything beyond this resolution in this size of a screen is overkill that is just using more power.  The glass is strong, but I would recommend a case and a screen saver to prevent scratching.Battery:Battery life is great in the device and you could easily fly from New York to Los Angeles on one charge.  The device recharges quickly when you use the additional cost charger which is a must buy unless of course you have existing Samsung or Motorola mobility devices that use micro USB in which case you can share the cable and chargers with your new Kindle.Wi-Fi connectivity:The new Dual Band capability is a big benefit as most routers contain G and N functionality allowing for greater range of connectivity from the wireless base station.Memory:With options for 16GB or 32GB you will have plenty of room.  People fail to realize just how big a GB is.  For the average person 16GB will more than do.  If you are a music nut or video freak there is the 32GB option, but to make your life easy Amazon includes free Amazon Cloud storage for media purchased from their store.  This is great because you can access your movies from XBOX, Roku or Google TV devices.", "Date": "December 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great value, beautiful device for media.", "Author": "Tracey Fox", "ReviewID": "R3TQ7KTJ2K5GLN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have the 7\" Kindle Fire HD, and love it.  When I decided to get something larger to use for out of town travel, I considered just about everything out there, but ended up purchasing the 8.9\" Kindle Fire HD.  I couldn't be happier! I put my hands on as many tablets as possible in the stores to make sure I was making an informed decision.  I even considered plunking down $600+ on the new ipad with retina display; also seriously considered the top of the line Toshiba tablet (has a great screen, among other things, but not as sharp as the Fire).  In the end, it was price and SOUND that made my decision.  I use my Kindle Fires mostly for music, web and video (aside from reading, of course).  The screen on the 8.9 is absolutely gorgeous!  Yes, the retina dispay on ipad is also fantastic, but the difference was not worth nearly twice the price, IMHO.  But where Kindle blew everyone away was the sound.  The stereo speakers on both sizes cannot be beat.  I literally had to put the speaker of the Toshiba up to my ear to hear it on the loudest setting in the quite noisy store I was in.  A few short steps away, in the same noisy crowd, the Kindle speakers were loud and crystal-clear, and not even all the way up.  I can really crank it up and rarely get any distortion.  Don't worry about the youtube app,etc.  There are plenty of instructions to be found on the net for loading apps like that onto your Kindle Fire.  Took me only a couple of minutes, and the app works just fine.  The silk web browser is fast, and I have no complaints about it.  A word about the ads vs ad-free argument: Unless you reeeeaaallly want to look at a picture of your kids or whatever for the few seconds your lock screen will be seen, I wouldn't bother cancelling the ads.  Even the \"suggestions\" at the bottom of the carousel are unobtrusive, and don't even show in landscape mode.  It's only $15 to opt out if it really bothers you, but I don't see what all the fuss is about. I used that $15 to buy a magazine subscription to enjoy on my awesome new toy!  I picked up the case made by Amazon, which to me is a must, and will be adding an anti-glare screen protector.  The Fire already has less glare than anything else I looked at, but I still like the protectors. Some things to take into consideration about my review: I do have alot of Amazon content.  Now, I know full well I could still have taken full advantage of my Amazon content from another tablet, but it may make a difference to some of you reading this.  I am not a gamer, and I don't have 500 time-wasting apps on my phone or Kindle, nor do I want them.  And last, I am not and have never been a die-hard Apple fan.  They make great products, but so do other companies.  If you are someone who will not be happy with anything but an ipad, please do yourself a favor and buy one.  Please don't buy this great Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and then return it and post a negative review because it's not an ipad.  I hope my review helps someone!

Anderson \"ann0314\"", "ReviewID": "RIZENF7XY436D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have tried out a LOT of different services now , we have iPods (4) and a father with the upper end iPad, we have a cellphone and had a tablet that was Google/Android based, we own a Surface and now we own Kindles (3). Yes I know we jump around a lot LOL. That is because we are trying to find that good balance between features, affordability, longevity, customer service, and ease that meets our needs with the stress on affordability because we are a family of 4 and this technology moves so fast that by the time you buy xyz 3, the new 6 is coming out LOL and keeping up can get VERY pricey on a family budget. My review is about contrasting the differences from my perspective:Customer Service (10/10):In this category for me, Amazon and the Kindle win, hands down. EXCELLENT customer service and I don't mean or take that word lightly at all. I've had to call all 4 companies for things and by FAR Amazon has been the best to deal with. I truly commend them for that in a time where it seems that area lacks more and more.Stability and Speed (7/10):Here I think the iPad/iPods/iPhones win it. Having used all the varying systems by far I think the iPads are the most stable and quick. That said, since the other companies are playing catchup, I would expect that to be so. The Kindle to me falls not terribly behind though. It does freeze here and there and I have had to do a shutdown/restart on occasion, more then with the iPods/iPad, but it isn't to the frequency that I have had to with other products so for me it isn't far off pace.Ease of Use/Base System Features (6.5/10):If you are coming from an iWhatever, you are probably going to come up a bit irritated and possibly baffled and very well may not initially like the Kindle. I know initially when we got ours I was \"underwhelmed\" especially with how things are setup. In this aspect I think iPads and Android systems have a leg up especially if you are like me and are a bit of an organizational freak. There are NO folders here, no way to move around or order things \"your way\". To me this was probably the BIGGEST issue I had with the Kindle. If you are someone new to tablets and this is your first, I think the Kindle is pretty straight forward and easy enough to figure out quickly. I know my 11 year old was off and running with it almost instantly.\"Fun\" Applications (9/10):In this area the Kindle is right in line with the rest. For a kid actually BETTER then the other three in terms of Parental Controls and services geared to keep your kids happy without the worry of your child using your credit card accidentally purchase to purchase something (though I will say I have less experience with this feature in the iPads so am speaking more about the Google and Microsoft systems for handling this which are both not so hot especially if you are a family with kids and adults using the same account or wishing to. On the application front, the worst of the bunch is the Surface which has a lot of NOTHING at the moment :( It is new so somewhat expected but I wasn't prepared for quite how anemic their selection really is. Probably one of the largest areas where the Surface falls very flat.Productivity (7/10):If you are looking for a tablet to Browse the net, I think iPad wins it. The Kindles and Android based tablets do well though for the casual user but for a power user you may find the Kindle a bit laggy. If you are looking for something to check e-mail the iPad, Androids, and Kindle all do well. The Surface though has a HUGE issue there. You have to use internet apps to check your e-mail if you have pop3 accounts...REALLY? O.o LOL If you are wanting to use MS Office products the the Surface wins. The rest do have apps that \"work\" but they do fall short in some areas so you wanna research if you choose this or one of the others to be sure there is something that does what you need. I will say if looking for something more for \"school\" for a child, the Surface, iPad, or Android tablets that run higher may be better. This system is good for general things listed above but not necessarily strong if you are looking for it to be a laptop replacement for heavy typing and taking notes etc. Great though for browsing forums, getting e-mail, internet, and light work.Reading (10/10):This is handled pretty well across the board with the availability of the Kindle app on most everything these days, though being able to borrow books if you are a Prime Member once a month or being able to restrict what your kids are reading is handled best by using the Physical Kindle.Movies, Music, and Sound (10/10):Strangely enough, the Kindle won on this level for me for a couple reasons (the Surface takes a good second because of the ability to add SD and flash cards to expand its size as do some of the Android systems) Amazon, unknown to me, has \"tablet\" editions of their movies...I LOVE THIS. If I buy a movie, Amazon gives you a full res version and a mobile version. If you DL the mobile version and put it on the tablet it takes up about 1/2 the space as the same movie on the other systems which means you can put double the movies on it. You do lose some resolution but if it's to keep kids busy on a long car ride its WONDERFUL. If you are more into the quality and want the HD etc though that is there still as an option as well. I also liked the Amazon Prime aspect in this area as well, giving access to lots of movies with your membership. Granted on this Kindle remember you have to have wifi to use Prime. On the music and sound side, I found the speakers on my Kindle to be by FAR the best of the group. The sound is actually REALLY nice. I have to admit I was impressed.Affordability (10/10):Definitely between the Kindles and the Google/Android units I think. For what you are getting for the price I think both these systems are doing a nice job. The iPad is great but not necessarily affordable for the average person especially when you consider what you have now will be outdated in a year or so (if you are lucky) if money is an issue, I would definitely consider these two systems though I won't say the Surface or iPads are unreasonable for what they do, just with their added features etc also have added cost. What that is worth to you really is a personal thing though :)To close (thank heavens right) after getting past the initial shock of how different this system was to the other 3 (especially the Apple system which OS wise I personally like most), I have really enjoyed it and would most definitely recommend it though whether it is best for you really does depend (as you can see above) what it is you are looking for. Fun, Affordability, For a Child, Productivity, Work etc. But for a general use Tablet for a child, reading, browsing the net without a laptop in your lap, I think this tablet definitely does it's job and very very nicely :) My whole family was happy with this purchase and I have recommended it to quite a few friends etc now especially those with kids or looking for an inexpensive solution to the Tablet quest.", "Date": "January 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love my Kindle", "Author": "Krystal", "ReviewID": "R2K1C0Z1NXW7HN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'll be truthful, I love my Kindle.

There are plenty of reviews about the overall conformation and performance of the Kindle tablets, but very little about the audio book and Whispersync experience.  Amazon has a selection of free classic books for Kindle, each of which has a companion narration, also free, available from Audible. These are an excellent selection of performances by well know narrators, three of which I had previously purchased myself. I highly recommend new Kindle owners \"buy\" these free titles and their companion audios.  Whispersync works in multiple ways across multiple devises. I can read or listen to a book on my Kindle, then pick up where I left off, reading or listening using the Kindle app on my Android phone. I especially like the immersive reading function, where the text on the screen is subtly highlighted and \"turns the page\" following the simultaneous narration.  The immersive reading does not work with books borrowed from The Amazon Prime lending library or with Audible narrations and Kindle books borrowed from the public library, but is very effective when using purchased Kindle books. Audible titles are often deeply discounted when the Kindle book is purchased FIRST. Unfortunately if I want Kindle books to mate to my hundreds of previously purchased audio books, they must be bought at full price. Not a big deal for me as I mostly listen on the go, but no early-adopter wants to feel that they have missed out due to their patronage.  My sole disappointment in the devise has been with the speaker volume, particularly with regard to audio books. I find the maximum volume to be adequate for steaming video from Netflix or Amazon Prime video, but for some reason the audio books are much lower in volume, too quiet for my middle aged ears, even when the Kindle is set on full volume. The speaker capacity is clearly there, and the audiobook volume is fine when I use earphones with my MP3 player, phone or the Kindle, but I can barely hear audio books on the external speakers when holding my Kindle while alone in a quiet room.  My mother has macular degeneration, and audio books are important to her. I had hoped that she could use my Kindle, and the clear controls on its bright screen to access the library of Audible titles I have acquired. She simply could not hear the narrations. Of course she could use headphones, and I am considering Bluetooth speakers, but these extraneous devises are needlessly complex for an elderly person.  I wonder if a software update might allow higher volume audio book playback?  I would also like to see an Overdrive app for the Kindle so that I can use audio books from my state library system. I listen to about 100 audio books a year, most of them free from the library. That does not keep me from being a good Amazon/Audible customer. I have subscribed to Audible's one or two book credits per month program for nearly four years, and have bought more books at the reduced member rate. As long as I'm unable to use my Kindle to download library audio books, I need to use a parallel set of devises for most of my listening. I look forward to software which would allow me to integrate all of my reading and listening.  Since Amazon has purchased Audible and has made great strides to integrate the Kindle reading and listening experience, it is clear that they have identified this as part of the future of reading. Please Amazon programmers do something so that I can set my Kindle down in a room and listen to an audio book as I go about my business.", "Date": "December 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Major bugs never get resolved, quickly loses product software support (no updates).", "Author": "Digitalmaster", "ReviewID": "RA5LVB4CAKG3I", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I can't recommend this product because of the issues that I have had with it the past 4 months that I have owned it.First, when it comes to hardware, I would rate it 3/5.

Rosario", "ReviewID": "RMRYVTG5TLXR0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was debating between a Nexus 10 and the Kindle Fire HD.  Both devices have their advantages and disadvantages.The Nexus has the Google Play Store along with all of its apps, but you cannot access things such as Amazon Prime without using the browser.  Also, getting a Nexus 10 requires you to work with Google Play Store support which is not always the greatest as I have had to deal with and still am on an issue regarding a music purchase.The Kindle does not have access to the Google Play Store, but it does have the Amazon Appstore as well as Amazon Prime access.  The Amazon Appstore has most of the apps the Google Play Store has including Netflix and many of the games.  The biggest gripe I have with the Kindle is that for some reason Amazon does not offer any of the official Google apps such as Gmail, GTalk, Google Maps and Google Music.  There is a work around to get these apps on the device as I have installed them myself.  You have to authorize installation of 3rd party apps on the device and download the .apk file from a trusted website.  There are numerous websites out there that have official Google apps all you have to do is search for the .apk for the specific app.  Unfortunately, there is no support for the apps this way so you do not get updates and many times the icon looks blurry and not HD on the Kindle carousel.  Other than that, the Kindle is a great device especially when combined with Amazon Prime.  I am using a stylus with it now and find it works better with it.  The WIFI antennas are very good for the device and can connect to very weak signals with ease, would not recommend connecting to just any network as there are hackers out there looking to phish for anything.Amazon Prime is great as it not only grants you access to the numerous TV shows and movies Amazon has under contract, but it allows to borrow books for free from Amazon.As far as the price with the offers goes, I opted to include the offers as it knocked $15 off the price and the offers are only on the device when it is locked.  Upon waking the device (pressing the power button) an offer is displayed.  You swipe to unlock the device and the offer is gone, not to be seen again until you press the power button again once the device is off.  It is not bothersome at all.  I have not had any problems with the offers thing and at times I have been interested by the offers.I opted for the Kindle, purchased December of 2012, as it was cheaper and it allowed me to access Amazon Prime shows with no problem.  I also liked the Kindle reading aspect of it.  The device does have a setting under reading font, Sepia, which makes it so much easier to read than a regular white screen.  This is actually on any device that you download the Kindle app for including cell phones.I would recommend this device to anyone looking for a tablet that allows for a lot of media consumption as it has access to Amazon Prime with ease as well as Netflix.  In addition, it would be a better device for families as it allows parents to lock parts of the device to prevent children from purchasing or accessing things they are not supposed to.", "Date": "March 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "This is by far the best tablet out there for the price!", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Kevin Hearn\"", "ReviewID": "RVHQD8DS6KB3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me just start off by saying that I am not an apple fanboy, so I have never truly been impressed with iPads or any other Apple product after 2000. I don't feel like the value is there, and as someone who doesn't have a ton of cash to drop on something like a tablet, I just can't justify spending minimum $500-800 on one.I have had my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" tablet (32 GB) since they first came out in November and all I can say is: WOW! These tablets are amazing! I can tell you that it has literally changed my life (in a good way). :) I am going to list my comments individually in sections so y'all can see the parts that are most applicable to you.Build quality:I like the very solid, ergonomic feel of this Kindle. It is light enough to hold in one hand comfortably, yet I never feel like I'm going to drop it due to its weight (unlike my Galaxy S2 Smartphone). I do not, however, like the buttons on the top that control volume and the on/off. These buttons are almost completely flush to the device and it can be very difficult to press them. I also continually press the wrong button on the volume rocker to change the volume on the device because it feels backwards to me. I also wish the device could know when I changed it from landscape to portrait and adjust the volume knob to be a little more intuitive that way. That may sound like nitpicking, but it can be an annoyance.Screen:On that note, the screen on this thing is just gorgeous. I have used it outside, inside, full light, no light, everywhere you can imagine and I have never had a problem seeing anything on the device anywhere. I live in South Texas and it can be quite bright here in the daytime (especially around noon-2pm) and I have spent many Saturdays outside reading my Kindle without any problems. It does require more brightness out of the screen which reduces battery life, but I never read outside for more than two or three hours so I have never had an issue with running out of power. I cannot say enough positive things about this screen!User Interface:I love the Amazon Silk browser, it is great and works seamless with almost everything. I did the infamous flash workaround with the dolphin browser (google it) and that works great as well. The only complaint I have about the apps is...sometimes I don't want apps to come onto the carousel after I use them. I am major OCD and I like to have my carousel totally empty besides the book that I am reading. I like the apps and I use them often, but I have to remove them from the carousel periodically. I wish there was an option that said \"do not put apps on carousel\", or even a list of apps you could put on the device that would do the same. Again, nitpicky....but a tad bit annoying.Reading:What can I say about the reading on this device? It is superb. From magazines, to books, to newspapers...everything is great. I have never had a problem with any of this and it works great. I love getting my Men's Fitness and my fiance loves getting Cosmo as well. They are always crisp and clear (gotta love that HD screen) and are never glitchy or freezing. This is really where this Kindle has changed my life. I am a teacher and it is very difficult for me to fit certain books into my backpack for school...but it is easy to fit my Kindle in there. I have read more books in the past five months of owning this thing than I had in a year.Ordering:Part of the reason I have had so much success with my reading is that it is very easy to order books from the device. I have bought books and had family members buy me books for my birthday and never had a problem. It is almost TOO easy to buy things for this device...because I spend a lot of money on books to read every month. Again, no complaints. It is far easier to make a buy on my device (which I keep with me perpetually) instead of having to remember to hit up a bookstore on the way home. And, let me add, cheaper to buy on the Kindle.Videos:I bought extra storage space to put my DVR shows on my Kindle for watching at various points when I am not home. Besides the fact that the only content it plays is .MP4 (a tad annoying) but the videos are always crisp and clear and never have to buffer or queue. I have absolutely zero complaints about video or playback on the device.Overall I would say that I have absolutely zero regrets with my Kindle. I have nitpicky concerns, but they are far outweighed by the benefits of this device. If you are like me and looking for something to make reading books and magazines easier-or even watching videos or movies, this is definitely the Kindle for you. I hope this review helps any of you that are on the fence about buying a Kindle Fire HD 8.9\".

There may be a way to fix this but I am not sure how.  They say the new Kindle Fire HD has a sharper picture than the original Kindle Fire but for my eyesight I can not tell the difference.  What I do like is the size is awsome and makes playing games like angry birds or fruit ninja even better.

Whipping out a heavy, hot laptop with that classic anemic battery power, under-powered graphics and sound for a thousand dollars, give or take four hundred bucks, was an unattractive proposition.  When I want to watch a video in bed, on the plane or in a waiting room, a tablet is perfect.  We're living in a tablet world now, so unlike when the iPad was the only game in town, now there's this thing, the Nexus 7 and even the Nexus 10.  Here's why I chose the Kindle Fire...  First, I already own a Kindle (e-ink Keyboard) and it ROCKS; light weight, long battery life, beautiful display, easy to use, wonderfully simple to buy content and enjoy it in mere seconds; a beautiful product.  A coworker showed me their Kindle Fire and it was also gorgeous, and this is a gorgeous product.  Easily competes with the iPad in the looks department.  As the advertising says, its display is visually indistinguishable from that of the Retina display on my wife's iPad.  I've been shopping for content from Amazon for years and I've been a Prime member for a while now, so getting to watch all my favorite TV shows and movies without dealing with a DVD player or the DVD drive in a crappy laptop is really nice.  It's so nice to be able to jump around--between social media, to movies, to my e-mail, to Skype with my wife when I'm out of town, over to my MP3s in the Amazon cloud.  The IDEA behind this product is awesome.So here's what it gets right...  Looks cool.  Awesome graphics.  Great sound in the headphones.  Based on Android so you can use some Android apps out of the Google Play store or Android MarketPlace in addition to the Amazon App store.  Reasonably priced.  Even though I use my other Kindle for reading, reading on this thing is pretty nice.  Screen is bright, color is deep and rich, very little glare, so, magazines are fun to thumb through on this device.  Some gripes I encountered on YouTube while trying to decide to purchase this thing included hard-to-locate power button.  I don't ever have problems finding and using the power button.  It is lame you have to purchase the power brick, but it does work and it's worth getting.  It's not too big to carry and if you get the cool leather case, you can stand it up for hands-free use.  I don't recommend the screen protector--it's crap (you get this oily looking rainbow coloring that doesn't go away no matter what you look at on the screen).  I don't care about the Special Offers--who is looking at their lock screen long enough to be annoyed by these ads?  Not me.  It doesn't have a rear camera but I already have a camera, AND a camera in my phone.  It's easy enough to transfer either of these things to this device via USB.  The camera it has is good enough for what it was meant for--Skype and video blogging.  The keyboard isn't the best, BUT, I hate all touchscreen keyboards; they're all hard to use.Here are the problems and I really hate saying this, but, there are a lot.  #1, the interface is the least intuitive of any thing I have ever used.  I wish I had at least one physical button that lets me just \"go home\" no matter where I am, which I think is ironic.  You get *physical* volume up/down buttons, but not a home button.  Instead, if apps hide your home/back/favorites icon bar, you have to remember to tickle the border to see if you can make it show up so you can get out of what you're doing.  Same deal with \"settings.\"  You have to remember to drag down the top border to get to REALLY useful things.  Something like that should be on the home screen, which takes me to my next gripe.  There is no home screen.  I'd like a nice clean \"page\" that lets me go to my apps, or, content, or whatever, but basically has nothing but the time and maybe a couple of status icons (i.e., On Wi-Fi, notifications from running apps, etc).  Instead, you get the carousel and I'm sorry, but, I don't like this thing, at all.  It's goofy to use and has a mind of its own...  Things go on it whether you want them to or not.  The most recent thing shows up first all the time, which is convenient, since when you swipe to the end of the carousel, there's no way to go back to the beginning unless you use the home icon.  I really hate that it insists on telling you what other people bought as Large icons under the highlighted app in the carousel.  I wish I could uninstall FreeTime; I will never give this to someone who needs an app to tell you when to stop using it.Reviewers complained about laggy performance and it's true.  If this thing gets busy with anything (moving around files, running certain apps), screen rotation, carousel swiping, etc. hangs/freezes for a moment.  I haven't heard much about the parental controls but I have a need to keep certain videos, photos and files password protected without locking the entire unit.  And the bad news is, parental controls are either ON or OFF.  When it's on, you can't just enter a password and access that feature.  All those features are just outright blocked.  So you have to REMEMBER to turn it back on every time you're done with a feature you don't want someone getting into by accident.  Even worse?  You can't do it by app.  You can either block all apps, or enable all apps.  REALLY bad.Storage management is a bit of a mess.  If you move a file from one folder to the other, it makes a Copy first.  So if you're nearly out of space on this device, the operation will fail.  No other computer disk system I've ever used works that way.  I know, no tablet gives you the ability to plugin and eject your own SD cards; which would have been a huge competitive advantage for this device.  Because the internal storage IS and SD card!!  How cool would it be that when you fill up the relatively microscopic 16 or 32 GB internal storage on this thing (because you don't want to have to use your WiFi every time you want to watch a movie), you could just plugin your own whopping 128 GB SD card and keep going?  No instead you have to play three-card-monty with the files on this thing, and the USB on this guy is the slowest of any Flash USB-based storage system I've ever used.  Or, literally double how much you are spending for the 4G version, the only model that offers up to 64 GB internal storage.  I wish the photo viewer organized pictures into folders--especially if that's the way I copied them there from a computer.  No matter what, ALL sort-by-date, ALL sort-by-name or ALL-sort-by-size is almost never how I want to browse my pictures or play them back in a slideshow.  Lastly, USB copy operations seems to use a TON of battery, and that it refuses to charge while plugged into USB (not even at all, not just slowly) is big-time design fail status.The \"booming bass with no distortion\" is a myth and was a primary reason for me to purchase the device.  The sound is stereo at least, and it is nice and clear.  And, perhaps if I played something with Dolby Digital encoding to activate the codec that might help.  But playing back my own MP3s or YouTube music videos is better off done through nice ear buds (good ones, not the cheap white things Apple gives you with an iPod).  You can't play back the vast majority of major video file formats out there, but, if you download and install MoboPlayer (after enabling application installation from \"unknown sources\" in settings), you will be in business.  No converting hundreds of files on a computer and then spending hours transferring them over slow USB.  Just transfer them once and play and DOES respect folders.  All hail the power of the Android operating system.I'm hoping that stuff gets better as new versions of the OS come out and I download and upgrade my device to use them although I get the feeling the more annoying things are here to stay...  Carousel is probably their money feature, so if you hate it, that's too bad.  I would say however that if you don't care about all of the stuff I found annoying, then for the money, you're going to get a good product out of this device.  It serves my needs and I didn't have to spend iPad money to get a tablet that lets me watch my videos and look at photos without having to lug around a laptop or be chained to my desk or home TV.", "Date": "April 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "This is the bomb!!!", "Author": "KenDiesel", "ReviewID": "R3MC2SFRARKFBV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me write this with all you people out there that have never had a tablet before. I myself would have never purchased one but for that my train magazines were going digital. I did my research. I talked to my brother who had an I-Pad3 and my sisters-in-laws that had kindles and samsung 7inch.  I looked at info and reviews online.  Now by the time I had done all this I was totally confused. All these people bad mouthing the different units vs. the people saying they were absolutely great. I started to note that a lot of the people bad mouthing were nit picking the units to death or were not following the proper procedures of setting up or using the proper cables or items required by the vendor.I finally decided, do I need a tablet is more business and entertainment for a higher price(ipad or samsung) or a unit that is made mostly for entertainment as a less price(Kindle). I pulled the trigger on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9.When I received it the unit felt just right size wise in my hands. (The Ipad that I tried was a little larger and the Samsung 7 inch felt and looked small, the 10\" to large). I hooked up to my wifi within 2 minutes. I started looking around and figured out how to download a free book(I signed up for Amazon prime-great deal for $79 a year) on the Kindle and started looking up all the things I could do. Within a week I was almost a pro. The movies that I have downloaded are just spectacular. Graphics of 1920 x 1200 are detailed. Amazon has a lot of apps, games, magazines, tunes and about anything else you could want. It so bad, I have limited myself to 1 hour a day using this tablet.Now, you may be saying this person doesn't know much about the specifics of all the things that are needed to be done and the Kindle can't do it. But, for the average person like me.  This is the bomb!!!I would recommend anyone out there that wants a tablet for reading, playing games, using apps and movies. Look no farther.

When I researched and reviewed all the specs and reviews on all of the Kindles, I finally decided on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 16 GB Wi-Fi.  Like so many others in the reviews, I was undecided as to whether or not I should get the 32GB and the 4G version or the Wi-Fi 16 GB.  So I read the reviews and then I really looked specifically at what I would be using it for, where I would be using it, what size would work best for my needs, and at the price, all of which really helped me make my decision.  The Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" is a little bigger and that works better for my eyes, especially for reading.  I am an avid book reader and loved my first Kindle but the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" is truly a huge improvement and a beautiful little tablet.  The quality and size are great for the price.  The HD is better than most TV's, the sound is great, the graphics are fabulous, and it's easy to use and go back and forth between functions.  I use it mostly at home or places where I can use safe Wi-Fi .  I really didn't want to add another bill for a data plan, so this Kindle works great for me.  I have mostly books on it, some music, several apps, and a couple of videos, so the 16 GB is good enough for my needs.  I also like that I can read email and send documents to it to use for my work, if I need to in a pinch.  I also purchased the Kindle Leather Cover in Royal Purple which is beautiful and the Kindle Powerfast Accelerated Charger, which I also got both at a discount when I purchased my Kindle.  I am very happy that I got the charger because it does charge it much faster.  This is probably the con that I would say that I have with the  Kindle Fire HD 8.9\"  Wi-Fi 16GB.  I think it should have come with the wall charger like it did with my other Kindle, but it doesn't keep me from giving this Kindle 5 stars.  It's a wonderful product for the price and I am very, very happy that I chose to upgrade to this Kindle.  I also received my purchases in one package before the date that they were expected to arrive.  I buy so much from Amazon and I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed with their service or products.  I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a great and easy to use tablet at a reasonable price, to buy a Kindle Fire HD in the size and style that fits their needs.

Im very happy with the way it feels in my hands. I hadn't bought a case for it as I wanted to see it 1st. Definatly needs a case as it feels like it might break in your hands being so thin. I turned it on, it knew me already and loaded its software  so far so good.I love the picture quality, perhaps even better then the Ipad (I have the Ipad4)Silk is ok no complaints as a browser except what I wrote below. Sound is better then the IpadI do have issues with it though... ill get into thoseSPEED...It claims its over %40 faster then new ipad  ofcourse they dont tell you which generation of ipad they are talking about. The ipad 2 was called new ipad as well as the 3 and 4i have the 4 and it is not close to as fast as my ipad 4  i would compare the speed to the 3rd generation Ipad but it loses to the 4thi did side by side comparisons as the ipad won even if I clicked 1st on the kindleIm not saying its slow, its not.  its just not as fast as the ipad 4SCREEN...I would have to say the kindle is just a bit sharper then the ipad 4Sound...not even close Kindle winsAPPS...Not even close Apple wins that onebut thats not to say there isnt a good selection to choose from.

Its a bit hard to explain, the response time isnt as good and sometimes i have to touch the spot 4 or 5 times like to go back, click on a link etc...ipad wins on ease of use but the kindles isnt really that bad here i call it a draw as I would rather have the flash loadTYPING...The ipad wins buy a landslide for me. you can tell apple is into ease of use, the kindles typing is klunky and I possible would not have purchased it had I realised how bad it is for me. If I make a mistake a few words back it is almost imposible to get to it to edit.  Lucky for me i only type in emails and its not that big of a deal for me.

This is my first tablet; I still don\u2019t own a SmartPhone (I still carry an original Razr).  I was considering this against the iPad mini after doing some personal research online and with friends primarily.  My first Kindle (the only other one in the house actually) is the keyboard version (before the PaperWhite model) and I\u2019ve used laptops for\u2026who knows how many years.  Also this review is written for the tablet novice in mind; those who are experts on the subject have had quite a bit to say about the Fire HD.  I please ask you to keep these facts in mind as you read the review.Personally, I love this thing.  There are a few detractions which I\u2019ll get into later, but they mostly hinge on the lack of charger and lack of a backward facing camera.The first item I\u2019ll get into is the ads.  I purchased the 16GB version with ads and let me say this:  they are unobtrusive and non-intrusive.  They appear on the lock screen, so you see it once the Fire awakens, and when you look at items on your carousel (books, apps and games) there is a small banner that shows what others who have that app/book have purchased.  For those who complain about these ads, I recognize that we all have an opinion and I\u2019m not going to invalidate them.  However if you have watched TV (like CBS, ESPN or CNN) or read a magazine (Like Time, Automobile and others) or been to any website outside of your own private network then you\u2019re already used to commercials & ads\u2026especially in a magazine.  This is far less intrusive than what you find in a magazine and far less prevalent than commercials.  For $15 off the price I think it\u2019s a great deal.  I would say that people should not be concerned with ads on your Kindle Fire HD; you\u2019re on this website & you\u2019re looking at ads already.Next, getting into how I\u2019ve used this thing every day.E-Reader:  It\u2019s great, however just like any other tablet, you have a backlight.  Personally I find the e-ink on a normal Kindle easier on the eyes and if *all* you\u2019re going to do is read e-books, I\u2019d suggest going the route of a PapwerWhite or standard Kindle.  On here you can choose a traditional black on white print, sepia (to simulate a slightly yellowed book) or white on black for reading material.  This setting translates across anything you read on your Fire HD (I have a magazine subscription and a double-tap of articles breaks out the article into the black/white I\u2019ve selected).  Your books synchronize across your devices, just like any other kindle/kindle reading app.However chances are if you\u2019re reading this you were going to do more than just read e-books.  Let\u2019s get into it, but only reviewing what the Fire HD comes with & what you can get on the Amazon Android App store.  I have not \u2018sideloaded\u2019 anything to my Fire; everything I have on my Fire is from the Amazon App store.Video:  My goodness this thing rocks.  You can use the instant watch (tons of things are free for Prime members) and you can use a USB to put your personal videos on your Fire.  Additionally you can grab several free apps such as Netflix or Xfiniti to allow you to stream video to your Fire.  The display is crisp and awesome.  You may consider getting an app or two for some video formats.  I know I can watch MP4 video on my Kindle; AVI is not natively supported.  As mentioned there are several apps that can remedy that situation.Related \u2013 Sound:  I\u2019m a bit of a sound snob.  Short of headphones, this is the best sound I\u2019ve heard from a mobile device by a wide margin, including my HP laptop with BeatsAudio.  It\u2019s not just crisp, it\u2019s true stereo, and dynamic at that.  Now it doesn\u2019t give you surround sound the way a nice set of headphones will give you, but if there\u2019s *equal* sound on any tablet out there I\u2019d like to know.  Example, I watched a video on YouTube that I\u2019d watched before and for the first time I could tell that some voices from the crowd were from the right, with others in the left & middle.  Speaking of which this leads me to\u2026Web Surfing.  This comes with Silk, the browser from Amazon.  Fact: there is no flash support.  Fact: I can watch YouTube vids just fine.  I suspect it may have to do with if the video has HD available.  The browser is fast and stable, most of the time.  There have been a few pages that have hung up on me, forcing a close.  I\u2019ve found this is more of a site-specific item rather than Silk in general.  FaceBook had a couple issues when I went to the Washington DC Auto Show and used the free WiFi in the convention center.  I downloaded the FB app later that day and FB worked fine from the house; when I returned to the Auto Show the next day & had good WiFi the app and surfing worked just fine.Apps.  The Amazon Android App store has a ton of content, and it\u2019s really easy to get to.  Plus you can just click another included app to shop the regular Amazon store; easy as pie.  It\u2019s not like you only have five apps to choose from.  However out of the box while you can view documents (word, PDF, excel) you cannot edit them.  There are apps that can be purchased that will allow you to do this, but it\u2019s still something I would have preferred.  That said there are enough things to get you up & running.Documents \u2013 taking a second here to write a quick note about documents on the Fire HD.  Yes, you can read them (.docx, .xlsx, etc.) but you cannot edit them with the supplied software.  Personally I find that when I want to edit items I use a laptop, but if you\u2019re expecting to be able to edit a spreadsheet you\u2019ll need an app from the store.Battery Life.  Nice and solid; they claim 10 hours of constant use and I believe them.  I used mine all day at the show, then continued to use it at home.  Plug it in at night and you\u2019re good to go the next day.  If you want to make that charge last longer, turn the Fire off rather than use the sleep function.The great surprise was what has become my favorite feature.  E-mail.Sounds like a simple thing, but the e-mail client that comes with the Fire HD 8.9 allows you to view all your e-mail in a single app.  If you have a few different e-mail addresses this thing is a life saver!  I have two g-mail, two yahoo and a home account on this device; you can even set it up for an exchange (work) e-mail client.  This has made it incredibly easy to keep up on all my addresses, including information from friends!  Each one has a dedicated folder, but you can also view them all in one folder should you choose.  Had you told me two weeks before writing this that I\u2019d rave about the e-mail more than anything else I would have laughed in your face.If you\u2019ve never owned a tablet before, this one is GREAT.  It has the Amazon store loaded right up onto it, you can get great apps for android tablets, video & sound are better than anything I\u2019ve been exposed to and the price is much better than the i-pad.  That\u2019s not to say this thing isn\u2019t perfect however.  Here are a couple things to consider.First, it does *not* come with a wall charger, and that\u2019s a shame.  You can plug it into the USB port in your computer but that is one slow charge.  They offer a wall charger for twenty bucks extra.  If you have one of the USB wall plug in chargers \u2013 specifically if it reads 9 or 10 amps, you\u2019re good to go.Next, they only have a single camera\u2026pointed right at you.  While that\u2019s great for Skype (comes on the Fire) it\u2019s not great for taking pictures of anything other than yourself.  Yes, you can make the camera work with some agility (you just can\u2019t get a good look at what you\u2019re taking a picture of) but that\u2019s a big minus in my book.  As a result of this layout, any app for taking pictures or video is in my opinion\u2026rather worthless.The last part of my review is to explain why I (personally) felt this was better than getting an i-pad mini.For thirty bucks less I get a larger display, a *better* display (larger is not always better!) and I can share my books/music with my other devices.  On top of that there\u2019s the sound that\u2019s awesome in comparison.  Apple makes a nice product.  I personally feel this is a better oneI thought about getting the Fire 7 inch but opted for the larger display to view video & photos on a nicer display, but I have to admit I considered saving the extra $100 and spending it on apps or (more likely) gas.Pick up a case and a screen protector.  If you\u2019re a first time tablet owner, you\u2019ll be using this thing quite a lot.And you\u2019ll be happy you did.That\u2019s my review in 1,600 words.", "Date": "February 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Goodbye iPad", "Author": "Gandalfe", "ReviewID": "R3FPRH9Y02COE1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Luv'd my iPad, but love the Kindle much more.

I had always been an iPad user.  Yet, because my iPad was a 1st Generation model, it had already begun to lag behind it's newer relatives in terms of newer features and updates.  So, since they are really very expensive IMO, I went into the hunt for a future tablet willing to purchase something else. After all, there are a lot of really good tablets out there right now.  So after doing a lot of reading and looking at tablets in stores, My thinking kind of went like this.I liked the Nexus 10 over the iPad, and by a little bit over the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\", even though it was close. What got me was the Nexus 10 has a resolution of 2560 x 1600  at 300 ppi.  Now having said that about the hardware, my eyes really liked the Nexus 10 and the Kindle Fire HD for two different reasons (from what i could see on the internet).  When I looked at the Nexus 10, I said, \"Wow, that is just overall great looking!  Great uniformity. No lag.  Awesome looking movies, etc.  And when I looked at the KFHD, I again said, \"Wow!\"  The flesh tones are awesome.  And whoa! The colors pop on this device. So, I read some more online reviews.  And people were saying the same thing about the KFHD.  And yes, The iPad looked great, just like always. But, I concluded, I really didn't want an iPad anymore. I really wanted something else. I love Apple's computers, but.. their tablets? Hmm? I've seen what other people have and there is some pretty nice stuff out there.  So, I liked  the Nexus 10, because of what I knew about the High Resolution numbers, and not so much by what I could see! And I liked the colors and the overall picture of the KFHD.Then, I started to evaluate the tablets in terms of what they could do. And I determined that the Nexus 10 is a BEAST.  It does most everything really well. And it has apps galore from the Google Play Store.  It flat out gets the job done.  It has a front and rear camera.  Movies look fantastic on it.  When scrolling from App Screen to App Screen, it doesn't stick or lag.  It is solid! BUT... BUT... It is also $100 more than the KFHD.. OUCH! And that is not really so good!On the other hand, the Kindle Fire is one HOT TABLET! Why? Because of what it does so WELL! it is designed to buy, rent, borrow,  and use products from Amazon online.  And whoa! What it does it does really really well. Movies, Pictures, games, comics, books, you name it, The KFHD is designed to QUICKLY and easily bring all that Amazon experience to you efficiently and cleanly! The KFHD's visual experience is FANTASTIC in its display of the product in action.  And it sounds excellent in terms of it's audio presentation.  It will absorb you, as it interacts with you.  At least, it did for me!  And as I was absorbed people yelled at me. It seems time flew by with out me.  It's a great experience. Well.. err.. yeahNow, I am going to admit something to all of you.  At first, I almost sent my Kindle back.  After coming away from an iPad experience, it was really hard at first for me to get used to the difference.  I just couldn't get the KFHD to do what I wanted.  For example, I was looking for the \"same\" Apps in the Amazon store, as I had on  the iPad that I had just sold.  For the most part, I couldn't find them.  Well, after I changed my kindle settings to allow for downloading from outside sources, this began to change.  Eventually I found most of what I had on my iPad on the web, and I downloaded those Apps to my Kindle.  Then I found substitutes from the Amazon Store for the things I could not on the net.  As I started to use the tablet after that, I really started to love my device.  And the more I used it, the more I liked it!  Now, I'm so glad that I purchased this.  It does everything that I want it too, and more than I imagined it could.I have to say, the Home Screens categories are spot on for what they offer.  Comics, Books, Apps, movies, games, etc., it's all here, and easily accessible.  I don't have to click on this, and then click on that.. oh yeah, and then click on this, just to get what i really want. It's all right there in each of those categories at the top of the Home Screen. And to top it off, Amazon Prime is such a great idea! My goodness, free two day shipping for prime members from Amazon? Are you kidding me? That's great!One more thing here really quickly.  I understand where a lot of people are coming from with their not liking the Ads showing up on their Kindle HD's.  Here is kind of the way I look at it.  When I browse the intent, nearly every webpage has ads on it. When I used apps on my Apple iPad, a good many of them had ads on them. The same is true of my phones apps.  IMO we live in a culture that likes to sell things. And one of the easiest ways do do that, is through Ads.  Now, I can't remove every single ad from my browser.  I can't remove every single ad from all of my apps on each of my devices.  BUT, I can remove the ads on my Kindle Fire HD.  I will have to pay $15.00 to do so.  BUT at least it is AN OPTION.  Now, I'm not so sure that I will do that.  The Ads on the lock screen look fantastic on the KFHD. And there just might be something there that I might buy. Anyway I don't know, if I'll remove them or not.Now, I'd like to make one recommendation to the people at AMAZON.  Would it be possible to provide some options to customers like me, that get bored looking at the same screen every time I use my device. For example, you could allow users to CUSTOMIZE the home screen.  The Home Screen lists at the top of the screen: Shop, Games, Apps, Books, Music, Videos, Newsstand, Audiobooks, Web, Photos, Docs & Offers. Why not let us decide which one of titles and their contents is going to be our Home Screen.  And I think it would be great if  Carousel was an option too.  And, what about a little color, huh? Could you also allow for some back ground color on the Home Screen?  I love my KFHD.  BUT, I must admit, having to look at the black background constantly gets a little OLD.  A little customization might help to make the kindle feel a little more like it's the owners and not just some interface that AMAZON is using.Anyway... To sum up... In terms of Quality for the Price, I think the KFHD is an absolute winner.  I really like the Nexus 10 too, BUT, it is $100 more than I can afford right now. Is the Nexus worth what people are paying for it? Well, maybe not right now.. because I see some of them selling for over $100  the advertised price, since they are sold out on the Google site, and people want them so badly for Christmas. I think it's getting a little out of hand.  But, for $100 more, which is what it usually sells for? Then it is a toss up! KFHD or Nexus 10?  Bother are great tablets. But in my case: for a $299 starting price, nothing beats my KFHD.  It is ONE HOT TABLET! Best for Price!", "Date": "December 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love it!!", "Author": "Clifton L.

The sound from the speakers is nice and loud with a rich tonal quality. The user interface and software seem mature and polished. I would say that it is highly intuitive to use. Ridiculously easy to use, actually. I had purchased a Nook HD+ a month ago but I returned it. It was such an underwhelming device.

They are all going up for sale soon(except the Kindle DX, that is). The Kindle Fire HD 8.9 makes me not want to pick them up again. Amazon's app and media store is tremendous. If you are looking for the Google experience, then this is not the product for you; as most of the Google apps are not available. Even when side-loaded the Google apps that require account sign-in will not function. Nevertheless, I can manage just fine without the Google experience.

I LOVED my Playbook, and was skeptical about the KF meeting my high expectations.  OK, I give....it's everything it's proposed to be, and WELL worth the cost.

All of my Kindles have given me great gadget joy, but the HD models came with one great flaw in hardware design: the placement of the charging port.These latter devices -- heck, the whole Fire line -- have been designed for media far beyond books. Specifically, video, which they all handle beautifully. The HD models, spectacularly. And take note of all, ALL of the covers that they sell for these models: they are all designed to allow the device to stand in landscape mode to avail themselves to the strength.My original Kindle Fire (first generation) looks a little it silly with the power plug coming out of its \"side\", but it functions perfectly that way. It stands in its pretty little (extra purchase) case and shows me video. Or plays music or games or even lets me read, but it stands naturally on its broad edge doing so.The HD models in their specifically designed cases though are awkward at best because the charging cable impedes resting the devices on their long edge: they \"lean\" on the cables instead. This causes imbalance and clumsiness and can cause undo wear on the charging connectors themselves.Fortunately, a ready solution presents itself in a different design for the charging cables. Make them with bent or hinged connectors so they don't simply jut out stupidly from the device and the device can then stand much more normally and the world will be perfect again.That one flaw is the only one that the Fire HD has to contend with, as far as I'm concerned.I ordered mine even before the whole ad-supported thing was an issue, the day it was announced in fact. I left that order intact as to not lose my place in line. I figured I'd deal with the $15 later. Having seen what all the fuss is about, it's mostly trivia. I'll be paying the $15 within a few days I'm sure, but it has largely been a on-issue.As for the device itself, with the aforementioned flaw aside, it is nothing short of spectacular.The display is stunning, the sound is surprisingly great, the networking is solid and the bluetooth range is exceptional. The touch screen is notably more responsive than the original Kindle Fire. Despite what I noticed in another review, setting up the AT&T; mobile service was a no-brainer.I had the presence of mind when I ordered this machine to go ahead and buy a wall socket charger, so charging it is nowhere near the headache that others have expressed. In fairness, this is one area where Amazon might have been a little more proactive and these models might have been better served by including this accessory, but I won't belabor this point.Overall, I am as delighted with both of my Fire HD purchases as I was with my first Kindle (keyboard model) and my first Kindle Fire. They all serve me books and music, but the Fires serve me video, which is what I am usually most hungry for.

This Kindle is just what I expected to be and I am extremely happy with it so far. I cannot understand some of the 1 and 2 star reviews that people are giving it. It seems like most of the low reviews are based on the fact that the purchaser did not review the specs on the Kindle to know what they were getting. I know that every now and again someone is going to get a dud but with amazons awesome customer service they will have a new one at the door the next day. I have a hard time believing the reviews that say customer support did not help them in any way.I have the 7 inch Kindle fire and I thought that one was great but needed a few tweaks. I did not like the speakers, but I would wear headphones most of the time anyway. The speakers on the new Kindle Fire 8.9 are great, no trouble at all while watching a show. I thought that the WIFI was a bit slow on the fire, but i am really happy so far with this one. I have not done any browsing online yet but I did download a few TV episodes in HD today and I was pleased at how fast they were done.

I will be testing it in bright sunlight soon but if the specs are correct that should be ok, one thing I could not do on my first Fire.I am not going to get all technical and go through all the specs, but the bottom line is as long as you research this and are aware that this is mainly used for entertainment and your not planning on running your home based business from your Fire HD you should be ok.", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great for Movies/TV, Books, Games & Magazines (not good for web browsing)", "Author": "Cliff Hays \"Cliff Hays\"", "ReviewID": "R2TSVS82KQ3LPV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The Good:In terms of hardware this is an excellent upgrade to the original Fire. The sound is better, the display is stunning by comparison, and it has eight times the storage capacity! As a result movies/TV and games look and sound awesome. Magazines - which I could not even stomach on the original Fire - are spectacular on this device. The pictures are clear and crisp, and the user interface can behave like a real magazine or a Kindle eBook. PDFs are also far more readable. The favorites have been moved to a star icon at the screen's bottom right (very convenient) to make room for a new feature of the carousel: as each new item moves to the fore, beneath it appears a scrollable shelfful of recommended items based on that item. So say you finish reading a really good book and want to find others like it, all you have to do is go to the home screen, bring that book to the fore on the carousel, and like magic you have a whole slew of recommendations to browse. This feature works on all types of items: mp3s, videos, games, etc. Another improvement is that there are external volume controls (unlike the original Fire where you would have to exit most apps to change the volume). In addition to magazines and PDFs looking great, ordinary kindle books look great as well (and the onboard ebook reader app is excellent as always).The Bad:The major flaw of this device is Silk (Amazon's own in-house made-for-kindle web browser). For users of the original Fire, Silk's bad name is nothing new. Only this time around I had an even worse experience with it! Basically, in two stints of web browsing (probably about 5 minutes each) the Silk browser froze multiple times for no apparent reason (usually about 20 to 30 seconds a freeze) and at the end of three of those freezes the browser not only crashed but caused the entire device to restart. Funnily enough, when Silk seemed to actually be working correctly it was extraordinarily slow. Unfortunately for the HD 8.9\" there are no other browsers in the app store at this time to use in place of Silk. Another drawback of HD 8.9\" is that several other apps that worked on the original Fire are not available: i.e. Art Authority, Treasures of Montezuma 2. For Kindle Fire users, I would check to see that your favorite apps will work on the 8.9\" before ordering it, that way you are not disappointed after the fact.", "Date": "November 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Going to love toting this around with me!", "Author": "J.

While the browser renders pages on Amazon.com quickly and with similar speed as a traditional browser on a PC or Mac, be prepared for very long load times, page load access errors and a lot of time spent watching the little circle spin on other sites.While my days are spent providing software support for a Cloud based application where typically my PC will have two versions of Internet Explorer and Firefox, Chrome and Safari browsers all open at the same time, I was not looking to write a review on the Silk browser. I just wanted to be able to surf the internet with a tablet.But instead of surfing the internet, I'm here writing a review because visiting amazon.com is the only site that will load. I wanted to relax and read the news or the sports, but instead I end up sitting with my Mac, PC and kindle next to my router trying to figure out whats up with the Silk browser and why sometimes it will render a page and others times be totally hopeless on the same page.I've tried a number of tests where a computer and the kindle were active and where only the kindle or laptop were on the network. The results are consistent where the kindle can take minutes and the same page (ex: sportsillustrated) will take minutes to render or just fail to load at all and the laptop will render in a couple of seconds.Yes a laptop has more processing power, but taking minutes to load a text based site such as drudge or not being able to load it at all is just not acceptable. Sometimes the page loads and sometimes not.I'm hoping there is a fixable solution and Amazon is not doing what MS did in the early days of breaking other peoples products to keep you using their products.

Just broke down and got one.-Camera is solid but not great.-I don't like Google Play, but it would be nice if I could go there for some apps.", "Date": "November 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great tablet for a great value!", "Author": "Matthew F. \"Procrastinator\"", "ReviewID": "R3R81GX16Z3ZUJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 32 GB back before the holidays this year when it went on sale for $50 off.  Without that discount, the cost before tax would have been $384 (for the \"Without Special Offers\" version).  Today I noticed that Amazon slashed the prices for Kindle Fire HD 8.9, so that the version I purchased would be $314! (as of March 13, 2013)  For that price, I would HIGHLY recommend this product.A little background on how I initially made the decision to purchase a Kindle Fire HD.  I have friends and family that own tablets, although the majority of them own the iPad.  Anyone who's played around with an iPad the last few years was probably at least somewhat impressed.  I've had several versions of iPods over the years, as well as a Blackberry for work.  So if I were to get a tablet, my initial preference would be for an iPad.  However, given that the cheapest iPads were still quite expensive (and I didn't want one without the retina display), I'd been on the fence about getting a tablet.  When the Kindle Fire HD went on sale, I figured, \"what the hell!\" and went ahead and purchased it (helped that I also had some giftcards, credit to use).At first, I was a little underwhelmed, as I was hoping for a similar experience to using at iPad, but I eventually learned to accept the limitations of the Kindle Fire HD and recognize what it excelled at.LIMITATIONS of KINDLE FIRE HD 8.9:My biggest complaint - lack of apps.  Anyone who's used an iPod touch, iPhone or iPad knows how many apps there are in the Apple catalogue.  Similarly for most Android phones, tablets, etc.  However, although the Kindle OS is build from Andoid, it's not really an Android environment.  They emphasize all of the popular apps that are available for the Kindle Fire, but there are many more which are not.  The frustrating thing is that Amazon sells apps for other Android devices in their appstore, but many of these are not compatible with Kindles.  An example of an app that I would like to install is Yelp or even something as simple as a Monopoly game (there is a version of it for Kindle, but not the one I wanted).  Not a big deal overall, but something to consider.  There's also something called \"side loading\", which I will get to in a bit.Silk browser - alot of the apps that aren't available have websites.  So one of the ways I worked around it is by just bookmarking their websites in the Kindle's browser, Silk.  However, that leads to my next issue.  The browser kind of sucks.  When it works, it's fine, but I has a tendency to crash quite a bit, which can be frustrating.  There are other browsers that you can install, but it's not so simple.Interface/ Smoothness of OS - most of the time this isn't an issue, but I have had occasions where navigating the Kindle Fire HD has gotten a little laggy or \"hiccup-y\".  It got so bad in the first few weeks of having it, that I had to reinstall the software, which has fixed this issue for the most part over the past two plus months of ownership.Video Formats - if you're like me and you want to use the Kindle Fire HD as a media tablet (video, music, magazines, books, etc.), you probably have quite a few videos on your home computer that you'd like to view on the tablet.  Well, if they're AVI's or anything other than these (MP4, 3GP, VP8), you're out of luck.  Anything copy-protected other than videos from Amazon is not going to work.  Now there are ways to convert files from another format to an .mp4 video that the Kindle Fire can handle (Handbrake), but it's kind of a pain.  They obviously want to direct you to their extensive video library, but if it's something that you already own on another format, it's somewhat frustrating.  Also, once you have the video file of your choice on the Kindle Fire, using the \"Personal Videos\" app on the device, you can't necessarily tell which video is which at first glance as it represents each video as a static screenshot (which could be a black screen!).THINGS I LIKE about KINDLE FIRE HD 8.9:Obviously the price is a big seller.  But you sometimes get what you pay for - what you don't get is an iPad experience, but it's still pretty damn good.Screen/ Hardware - I don't think it's quite the same as the retina display, but to my untrained eyes, the screen is pretty nice.  I have an iPod touch, and I've used it to watch videos, but one of the main reasons I wanted a tablet was for a bigger screen, and I am very happy with the Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  Some have complained it's too big or heavy to hold with one hand, and yeah, I get that, but it works for me.  I also liked the rubbery backing, and when it's working smoothly, the touchscreen is great.Sound - yes, it does have great speakers for a tablet.  Makes it very nice to watch videos, listen to music, play games, etc.  They face backwards, behind the tablet, which is sort of weird, but it's not a major issue for me.  It does come with a headphone jack as well, of course, and the headphone sound depends on your headphones, but it's fine.Reading/ e-reader - Given that this is a tablet from Amazon, it's natural that it should be an excellent e-reader.  My fiance has a dedicated (e-ink) e-reader, the Nook, and you can't beat the battery life and the screen quality (for reading) of e-ink, but given everything else you can do with a Kindle Fire HD, that's a minor quibble.  As Amazon no doubt counts on, I have purchased several Kindle books once I purchased my Kindle Fire HD, and I've really enjoyed reading them on the device.  I even purchased the Audiobook versions a few times, and I really liked reading along to the professional narration provided by WhisperSynch for Voice.  Oh, I should also mention that you can purchase graphic novels that are optimized for the Kindle Fire, which is pretty cool.  Locke and Key: Vol. 1 Welcome to Lovecraft Star Wars: Legacy Volume 2--ShardsWhisperSynch/ Cloud - the fact that I can be anywhere, and purchase an app from Amazon or a Kindle book and then have it show up on my Kindle Fire HD automatically is a plus.  Also, the cloud storage for any mp3s/ videos that you purchase from Amazon and the ability to then download them to your Kindle Fire or play them from the cloud (with wifi connection) is great.  I am seriously considering paying the $25 or so to be able to upload all of my mp3's/ music from my computer to their cloud player.  The new Autorip feature also is pretty cool in that it automatically adds .mp3 versions of any CD you purchased from Amazon to your Cloud Player library.Amazon Prime - yes, you get one month of Amazon Prime free.  I also opted to pay the $79 for a full year.  Not only do you get free 2-day shipping of physical products, but for the Kindle Fire owner, you get access to their Netflix-like archive of movies and tv shows.  While it's not as good as Netflix, it's still pretty great.  There's enough shows and movies that I'm interested in to make it a good investment.  I don't know if I would purchase Prime only for the shipping, but add in the Prime Videos, and it's worth it.  You also get access to the Kindle Lending Library, but aside from a few well-known series (Hunger Games, Harry Potter), the majority of books available are either public domain or self-published.  I have no doubt that some of these books are great, but most of them are uninteresting to me, a rather avid reader.ISSUE on WHICH I AM \"AGNOSTIC\" - I think 16 GB is a little too small for most people, so I opted for the 32GB version.  I think this gives me enough flexibility to upload my personal media to the device, but it's still somewhat limiting.  If you use your Kindle Fire HD for mostly streaming media or Kindle books, then it probably won't be an issue.  But if you plan on adding tons of video and/or audio files, it's somewhat limiting for times when you don't have wifi.A few notes on apps and \"Side Loading\"So there are some decent apps that you can purchase from Amazon.  Many of these are free, and I'll highlight a few that I like.Twitter - much easier to use than the Facebook app.  Not much else to add.  I use it and it's free.  TwitterES File Explorer - this is a great app that you can use to look at all of the files on the device.  It also has a built in video player, and I've found it easier to use than the Kindle's native \"Personal Videos\" player.  Yes, as I've noted previously, you can upload your own videos to the Kindle Fire HD, but they must be in a .m4v or .mp4 format.  You can find many video converters that you can use to convert non-protected video formats from one to another (Handbrake is what I use). Free.ES File ExplorerComicCat - This is a paid app, but only $2.99.  If you like to read comics, especially e-versions, then it's a good investment.  You can find all sorts of comics online for purchase or otherwise.  I believe it only reads .cbr or .cbz files, but again, it's easy to covert zip files to these formats.  ComiCatAngry Birds Star Wars - similar game to the original.  Looks great on the Kindle Fire HD.  Angry Birds Star Wars Premium HD (Kindle Tablet Edition)Plants vs. Zombies - one of the other really well-known games available for the Kindle Fire.  Graphics appeared to scaled up versus actual HD, but this game is one of my favorites.  Plants vs. Zombies (Kindle Tablet Edition)Side-loading apps - As I mentioned before, Amazon sells more apps on their Android appstore than it allows to be installed on the Kindle Fire tablet series.  So you can buy some of these apps, but you can't actually run them from your tablet.  You can also download and then upload apps from other stores and sources and install them on your Kindle Fire, but you first have to change the device settings to allow you to install apps from \"unknown sources.\"  So side-loading is basically putting these apps for Android (from Amazon or elsewhere) on your device manually.  Sometimes they will open and work, other times they will never open or crash your device.  It's a mixed bag.  Do your research on where to find safe software to purchase, and be aware that it may or may not work before you spend money on non-Amazon approved apps.  I initally side-loaded a few apps, including the Maxthon browser Maxthon Mobile on my Kindle.  Sometimes they worked, but I think that's what also led me to reinstall the OS after a few weeks.  I hope Amazon speeds up the process for approving Kindle Fire apps in the future to avoid this issue!A few notes on accessories:Power cord - the Kindle Fire HD only comes with a USB cable with which you can charge it.  It is VERY SLOW to recharge connected to a computer.  I got around it by using the cord with wall adapter for another device, but even then it takes 10-12 hours to fully recharge from empty.  They sell their own charger for an additional $20, which kinda sucks, but I finally did it and bought one the other day (with a $20 credit). Kindle PowerFast International Charging Kit (for accelerated charging in over 200 countries)Case - you don't NEED a case, but I think it's worth investing in one.  I found one for a decent price with decent reviews.  There are several options out there.  Marware Vibe Standing Case for Kindle Fire HD 8.9\", BlueMicro-HDMI out cord - you can also use any larger display with HDMI to view what's on your Kindle.  I purchased one for a few bucks.  I've found that I never use it.  Up to you.So overall, these are my detailed thoughts about the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 32 GB.  While it's not the BEST tablet out there, I think its benefits far outweigh its deficits, so I would highly recommend it for anyone looking for a tablet for a really reasonable price (especially for Amazon fans, who probably already have one already!).", "Date": "March 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "An excellent choice for me", "Author": "Cheryl Hannah \"AspenGal\"", "ReviewID": "R2W9E6QKINW2BZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't have an iBrain - won an iP*d at a conference, tried using it for 3 months and sold it to a co-worker due to my frustration-factor.  I definitely prefer Android to Apple ios, I've discovered.  After much internet-searching, I decided to buy myself a 9\" Kindle FIRE HD for Christmas with some Amazon gift cards.  A very good choice on my part!  I'm already a member of the Amazon-universe (have owned 2 Kindles [2nd-gen and Touch], have the Kindle reader on my desktop PC and netbook, am a Prime member, shop Amazon quite a bit) so the FIRE has fit right in to 'my' electronic universe.I did not need or want a replacement for my desktop PC - the FIRE provides a nice alternative for access to most of the functions I want to use while traveling or at work (where many websites like YouTube and personal email sites are blocked on those computers).  I did not purchase the 3G version, since Wi-fi works for my purposes. Wi-fi is pretty widespread around the U.S.  I've had no problem accessing wi-fi while traveling internationally either, in Turkey, Ireland, Australia, since most hotels now offer free wi-fi. While traveling I like to keep track of local weather where I'm staying, home emails, US news, pay ebills while away, check out local entertainment venues, etc.  I have a small netbook which I've taken with me in the past for this purpose...now my FIRE will handle everything I did with my netbook, while being smaller and more lightweight to carry.  My 9\" FIRE fits in most of my handbags except the smaller cross-body bags.I'm not a big gamer, nor do I want to store a lot of videos or movies on my FIRE, so the 16G version works for me.  I still have 87% of my available memory left, so I CAN download a few movies for the long flight to Venice this fall.  I have watched some TV shows via the Xfinity app (our local cable company) - all but one worked very well with my home wireless router, with no stopping-and-starting or freezing of the video.  I'm a photographer, and will NOT be using the FIRE for photos since I have a nice digital camera.  It seems very awkward to me to attempt to use any tablet as a 'camera'.  That function was not important to me in my decision.The HD screen is very sharp and colorful (even my die-hard Apple friends admit '...it looks GOOD!').  The touch-screen is sensitive (although it helps to frequently clean the oily fingerprints from it - I clean it daily just before I start the overnight re-charge).  Adding my gmail email account to it was very easy, I've added the VMWare app for access to my work computer, and several other apps which I've used on my desktop PC and find work well on the FIRE also (I've reviewed many of them on the Amazon website).  I still prefer reading books on my Kindle Touch (easier to hold in my hands for a long time), but I do read on my FIRE when I'm also using it for other things (emails, YouTube, checking emails, etc).  Amazon's 'syncing' of last-page-read works very well for both devices (as long as I remember to turn on the wireless on my Kindle Touch while I'm reading).I bought the Amazon cover for my FIRE (though I choked at the $40 pricetag); it works pretty well for propping it in a horizontal alignment (although it does 'slide' flat occasionally on slick surfaces), not very good for vertical since there's no viewing angle adjustment (I seldom use it in that way, though a couple of apps display ONLY in the vertical mode).  I like how slim this cover is - doesn't add much bulk to my FIRE, and seems to protect it well.  For use at home and my job it works fine.  I'll probably buy another cover, though, once more are available for this new 9\" HD-version of the FIRE; a cover which will allow multiple angles in both the horizontal and vertical positions (I have one of those for my older 7\" Galaxy tablet, and it works very well).I ALWAYS buy at least 2 extra power cables for every electronic device I own; per other reviewer's advice, I bought the non-Amazon AC 'rapid-charger' which was half the price and works much better than trying to charge via USB.  I took the USB-only 'charging cable' which came with the FIRE to work, so I can plug my FIRE into my desktop computer while using it there.  Other reviewers are correct in stating re-charging via the USB function is VERY slow.  In fact, my FIRE tells me when I turn it on that it won't \"re-charge\" the battery while I'm using it; however, it does MAINTAIN my battery charge while in use, so at least I'm not draining it.LOVE my 9\" Kindle FIRE HD...I'm much happier with it than I was with the iP**.

I bought this especially for an ebook reader - kindle and PDF - but will use it also for typical tablet activities.Having not had a touch kindle before, I took this for a test run with my previously bought kindle version of Canterbury Tales (Penguin edition), which is heavily footnoted.  What a delight to swap easily between the text and the footnotes, with just a touch!The PDF reader which comes with this works well, but has the typical issue of most PDF viewers that if you want your page size larger, you have to re-zoom each page.  I installed RepliGo PDF reader (from the Amazon store) which retains your page size as you scroll.  It also has a feature to use the volume keys (at the top, next to on/off switch) to page forward or back, which is a nice alternative to the finger-touch method.The size of this device is wonderful.  I have an ipad-sized tablet already, and it is just a bit too big for comfort, or to carry around in a handbag. Also have a 10\" netbook for reading at home, which I still cherish, but of course the size and weight cannot compare.Prediction: The Kindle Fire HD 8.9 will be a big winner longterm, and its size may well become standard for tablets.", "Date": "December 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wow!

Like a high quality paper book. As always, i find the Kindle touch screen technology to be less than perfect (that's where the 5th star went, and it made me feel guilty). But the overall performance is spectacular. And I have owned at least one of every Kindle branded eReader, and have read hundreds of books. This is a great reader.Now to other things: As a movie player, and music player, and photo display, it again is terrific. Whether it beats the latest iPad, I don't know. But it has to be close, and it is better than earlier models. (Disclaimer-I own one of the latest generation iPads with the Retina display)SO HERE IS MY ADVICE: BUY THE 32 GB VERSION, SO YOU WON'T HAVE TO EXCHANGE FOR IT LATER, LIKE I DID. The thing is good enough you will use it for all sorts of things. Let me be clear: Other than screen performance, this is NOT to say it is an iPad. That's not its purpose in life, though it obviously will do lots of things as its support system grows.It is the best eReader around, with movies, music, and photos thrown in. Just save the effort and get the 32 first time around.PS:And icing on the cake is the Kindle leather \"Standing Leather Case\". Wonderful quality, and the feel and smell of the leather is like an expensive car. I wish something that trim, and high quality was available for my iPad. So I would buy this case (Mine is in the \"tan\" color!), if for no other reason than the fact that the eReader is so thin, and slick finished that it is hard to hold.

I am disabled but LOVE to read. Not real fond of listening to books. This Kindle allows both options, but I still prefer to read the book. I love the touch feature because of fused finger joints. I had been rereading physical books the past week while waiting for this & found that I was trying to use the touch-to-turn-page feature & the definition feature. I am already addicted to the features of the Fire series.I registered this one for the $49.99 deal with AT&T; for a year's 4G but intend to use mostly WiFi when available. But the deal is great for when I'm traveling or in an area I don't have WiFi available. The plans for after seem reasonable with the 250 MB a month @ just $15 a month. But I'll have to see if I can keep usage down that low.For the download of books (most) the WiFi feature is great, it's the movie downloads & streaming that really need the 4G. There is a way to turn on/off the 4G feature & it was relatively easy to stumble upon if you are familiar with the previous Fire & how to change the settings. You go to the menu bar & select Wireless then turn off the Mobile networking. Turn it back on when you need but keep it off otherwise. This also saves on the battery usage, it'll last longer per charge with 4G & WiFi off.The bigger but lighter chassis is great for the arthritis. It spreads the weight over larger area so it doesn't hurt as much. Like the option to Skype, although have not tried it I do intend to use this feature.This model also has better parental controls with the Freetime system. You can set up individual \"accounts\" for each child with content control, time control, age appropriate content, etc. I don't know yet how many separate \"accounts\" you can create but I will be testing the number because of the number of kids I watch.One thing I'm ambivalent on is the Favorites. The old way was simple, they were just under the Carousel. Now you have a star icon that you can access from anywhere. I was used to the other way, so I'm still having to stop & think \"where are the favorites?\" I think I'll get it soon enough.The new touch system is more sensitive, which is good & bad. It doesn't take as much pressure so sometimes you find you open something you didn't want or making a move in a game that you didn't intend. But that, too, is something I think I'll adapt to.The big thing I don't like is that the menu bar is no longer accessible by simply touching the strip. You have to drag down the strip & then select what you want to do. I realize I'll get used to this & it probably seems minor to others but it bugs me because you have to drag it a minimum distance & sometimes I don't get that distance & have to try again.The sound is better & louder than before, too. But I discovered some of my previous apps aren't compatible with this HD model. They can still be played on the other Fire but not here. That kinda bummed me out, but I'll just have to find other versions or replace them with something altogether new.The option to have advertisements/special offers don't bother me. But if they did, you can get rid of them for $15, which seems a real deal if you just can't ignore the ads.All-in-all, I'd say this is the best thing out there. Better than iPad by far considering all features & the price. & it also is easy to fix if it freezes, just power down by holding the power button for 30 secs & let rest before rebooting.

We have the 2012 version of Kindle Fire HD 7 inches screen which still performs well but I would like to get another one that I can also use to take with me to meetings to take notes.The Kindle Fire HD 8.9 is a big difference as compare to the 7 inch version. The screen is a lot bigger and the CPU is a little faster.Below are the list of things I usually do with my Kindle.1. Internet: Internet is fast both from browsing and streaming videos.  I stream videos from HBO GO, Netflix, Amazon Prime and Youtube and all apps performs well on both my Kindle.  No lag or buffering issue.2. Home Network: I was able to connect easily to my home network and was able to access and stream home videos and movies from my cloud drive (WD Mycloud 3TB) using both Skifta and PLEX.3. Apps: I have downloaded hundreds of apps from Amazon with their Free App of the day most of them I tried and removed from my 7 inch kindle but let it stay on the cloud and so far I have not experience any problem with the apps I have tried on this device.  Some of the apps I can remember from my head.  Angry Bird (Original, Starwars, GO), Cogs puzzle, Looney Tunes Phonics, Flick Golf, Flick Soccer, Pocket Informant 3, Dora ABC, Facebook, HBO GO, Netflix, Youtube, Overdrive, etc.4. Reading: I have the Money Magazine and Kiplinger App and both works without any problem. The only thing is that the Kindle screen size is too long for those magazine so there is a black bar at the bottom if you are reading on portrait mode.  Books from Overdrive and Kindle were fine.Some Features I like on Kindle Fire HD.1. Display: The display on this device is much clearer than it's 7 inch counterpart. Also, I could say that even though that the Ipad have a higher resolution, the kindle Fire HD 8.9 looks much sharper on the classroom lighting.  It could just be the setting on each device but I'm not sure as I  don't play with other people's device. i just compare it side by side.2. Speaker: The speaker on this device is decent. It is clear and loud enough to play music and also movies. We have actually used this in our church to show video to around 12 kids sitting in front to watch a video. The sound is actually clear in a room that is around 15 x 12 when everybody is quiet.  The Ipad that the other teacher use actually needs an external speaker for the same setting.3. Size:  The bigger screen is a lot better than the 7 inch HD that we have. It's bigger real estate made it easier to type on a desk setting or while it is on your lap and give you a better experience watching videos and reading books.  However, bigger screen also means that it is heavier and you will need bigger hands to be able to reach all the letters while typing.  When it is on my lap or desk, typing is much better but when I am holding it up while lying down and reading, it is a little inconvenient for my medium sized hand to reach all the letters of the keyboard without changing the way I am holding it.This Kindle Fire HD 8.9 is great for adults but it may be a little inconvenient for small children.  Observing my kids ages 6, 4 and 2 on how they handle both Kindle Fire HD 7 and 8.9 inch, I could say that they are more comfortable with the smaller version due to the size and weight.  So, if you want one for yourself then go for it but if you are thinking of buying it for your young kids then consider saving more and get the new 7 inch screen.HDX vs HD: I'm sure that some of the people looking at this review is also confused on which version of Kindle to get. What I suggest is first know what you wanted to do with your tablet and also if you will need constant customer support. If you call customer support a lot then the HDX is for you due to the mayday feature where you can get support right on the tablet instead of via phone or email.  HDX have a a better resolution and sound and also a faster processor but if you are just looking for a tablet for video streaming, books and some games then this version should be more than what you need.", "Date": "February 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Kindle is elderly friendly, no digital conversation required", "Author": "Happy Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1J5S3IUUN95DT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife absolutely loves her Kindle.

I didn't feel it was up to I [Pod standards, but that's just me.  I was contacted by Amazon via email in April about my review and they seemed to want to help but I didn't bother to get back to them.  Then this week  my music stopped playing; my videos wouldn't play and so I decided to call them even though by this time almost five months had gone by and I felt I was too late to get any help.  Not so, Amazon's customer service walked me through some easy trouble shooting and when that still didn't work they sent me a brand new one the next day with overnight shipping. So the reason I was not crazy about my Kindle was due to the fact that I had a defective model and now my new one works superbly and I am extremely happy and I can't say enough how much customer service from Amazon made the experience much more worth it.  You got a problem? Contact Amazon.  They want to know why you're not happy.

I even made a few trips to Best Buy so I could handle and use each size to compare the two, as well as other brands.  I figured that the larger 8.9\" size was best for me because I need reading glasses now and I was a little hesitant about the smaller screen model.  I also joined Amazon Prime when I bought my Kindle and the instant videos are fantastic.  I've had my Kindle about 3 months now and I've ordered more books than I ever would have thought because there are some great low prices (for me - $3.99 and under) on many wonderful books on Amazon.  I am wary of which games I download because of permissions but am totally hooked on the few I have which were either free or cost $1.99 or less.I bought my Kindle because I was going to be starting dialysis and I didn't want to use my laptop on a shared network and of course because the Kindle Fire is so much smaller and lighter weight.  It has proved to be no problem to hold for long periods of time and is very comfortable to use.  Movies are clear and beautiful and many of the ones I watch are subtitled and those are very easy to read.  Typing on the keyboard is easy and never annoys me unlike trying to use the tiny one on my Dell Mini 9\".  I have not needed to purchase a stylus and doubt that I will.  Wiping the screen with a microfiber cloth keeps it clean and print-free, though I am very careful and protective of my Kindle.  I bought a strapless neoprene carrying case that fits perfectly into another neoprene carrying case with handles as my intention was for the Kindle to bounce when tucked inside it's protection if it ever falls and I think it just may do that.I ordered the charger with my Kindle because I didn't have any other that I could use and it is great, too and was only $10.00.  The only function that really seems to eat up battery power is playing games but in one 6 hour dialysis session, I can easily watch a movie, read a book, and play games all on one charge.The only drawback is mine, nothing to do with the Kindle.  I live very rurally and my internet connection is beyond slow, so I have to load movies when I visit friends who have high speed connections, but I just load 10 or 12 (at perhaps 2 minutes per movie) and they remain on the Kindle more than long enough for me to watch one per dialysis session (every other day).  Books load with no problem, despite my ISP.  An operator at Amazon said that he'd worked there for 9 years and never seen anyone with as slow a download speed as mine!I am enormously pleased with my Kindle Fire HD and still cannot believe I own it.

My Kindle Fire HD 8.9 arrived earlier today. I was very anxious to open the package and get my hands on this baby to see how it felt. First thing I noticed is the quality of the build. Excellent all around. I fired it up, using the optional quick charger I bought with it. Had it registered and software updated within 10 minutes or so. The images on the screen are crystal clear with vivid and true color. I played an Eric Clapton YouTube video right out of the box to see how the picture and sound quality were. Very impressive, to say the least. The speed between my WiFi and the Kindle is great. No flutter, no hiccups, just a fast and consistent connection. I surfed the web a little bit and this new Kindle HD moved effortlessly through the pages I browsed.I have many more things I want to try on this new tablet, and I'll get around to it when time allows. That said, my early impressions are WINNER WINNER Chicken Dinner. This thing is top notch. We have a first generation Kindle Fire and use the heck out of it. The new generation is everything I expected and so much more. I also bought several of the Kindle Fire HD 7\" tablets for family members. I fully expect they will enjoy them a bunch. I have an Apple I-Phone 4S and think it's a very good phone. I tried the I-Pad out, and while it impressed, for me, it was severely over priced given what you get. I'm not bashing the I-Pad at all, so please don't you Apple FanBoys come out and attack me en masse. LOL I know how sensitive Apple users can be. Look, they make very cool stuff, no question. My problem is this. Simply put, it's way over priced. All you have to do is look at their profit margins. For me, the new generation Kindle HD is right in my wheelhouse. It's priced very well for what it delivers. I am a BIG time Amazon junkie too. I buy a ton of stuff from Amazon and have never once had a bad customer service experience. Buying the Kindle HD was a natural fit for me. I am looking forward to using it a ton.I'd like to take a second to thank Jeff Bezos and his great team for bringing us an affordable tablet with top notch quality and features too numerous to mention. I love Amazon. I'm a customer for life.More to come, stay tuned.Added this >>>>>>>>Battery life on this 8.9\" Kindle Fire HD is simply outstanding. I seriously can't believe how long the juice lasts. Outstanding!!!As I add apps to my Kindle, I am even more impressed with the flexibility of this tablet. And whoever said the app store is lacking is seriously mislead. there's a huge variety of superbly done apps.I use my Kindle a TON. I can't tell you how impressive this tablet is. And when I consider what I paid for it, I can only once again say a huge Thank you to Amazon's Team kindle. This tablet is everything and a lot more than I expected.

I also have a Kindle with keypad that I love. This new device is well made and has a beautiful display. The web browser is awesome. I was surprised at how many apps were available for the Kindle Fire. I set it up with my multiple email accounts, calendars, and contacts. This lead to my first real disappointment. It's not possible to sync my Outlook contacts or calendar from work. While I don't need this device for work, it starts getting annoying when I have to put it down and reach for my phone to see all of my calendars and contacts in one place. The next issue I had was the power button. It's hidden so well in the frame of the device that I really have to search and almost need to actually look at it to find it. What's the big deal? Well, I like the iPhone and iPad's obvious wake button because I can get to it right away without searching for it. And, since I thought this new Kindle with its backlit display would be nice for after dark reading in bed without waking my husband, I would appreciate less awkward fumbling in the dark to turn the thing on.That leads to my next complaint- this thing is too big for reading in bed. I can't lie on my side and hold it propped up with one hand comfortably. And, it's a spotlight shining at my husband's side of the bed when I do.Finally, though it has a lot of apps, most aren't free. So, to have apps I use on my iPhone or iPad on the Kindle, I have to pay. That's jarring since I've used many if them for free on the other platforms. And, the app I use most often is Facebook. The Facebook app on iPhone is annoying. But, on the Kindle Fire, it's nearly useless. And, if you think that autocorrect is frustrating on iPhone/iPad - you will be as frustrated by Kindle's auto correct spell checking feature. And, possibly frustrated with what seemed to me a slower keyboard.If I didn't have a familiarity and daily reliance on my synced email, calendars and contacts, or constant need to check FB, I'd be completely satisfied with this Kindle.

Can they do it at this price point...no.I have not signed up for the 4G LTE service so I can't speak to that.  I only use mine on Wi-Fi and it works great.

This review is meant for late comers like me, people who are tech savvy but choose to wait out for the new tech to mature and then spend 25% of the initial cost.Was hearing a lot about everybody replacing their notebooks/home PC's with tablets and upon seeing Asian tourists takingpictures at Hoover dam with these instead of their cameras, I decided to enter the 2010's.After doing the exhaustive research as you have to do for any buying decision nowadays, I narrowed down my choices to Kindle 8.9HD, Nexus 10.1\" and the iPad 10\", felt like a cheat at BestBuy where I went to check out all my choices without any intention of buying them there.  I decided to go with FireHD as the intended use for me is to watch videos, read emails, view PDF's and light spreadsheet work, the deciding factor was the price, stereo speakers and most importantly the screen resolution.Must point out that the Amazon AppStore does have very limited offerings, I hate that the kindle OS does not let me read my gmail emails on the app I downloaded from the 1market store, the other apps I downloaded from there do work, including the google maps which saved me from returning this tablet.So, in conclusion, here's the gist:1) Great product for Amazon-Heads, people who are married into their system with prime membership and so on2) Great product for limited use like basic email/spreadsheet/doc work, watch video on netflix/prime, view PDFs etc., NOT a great  product if you're designing the next city center or the next new gen car...sorry had to take a dig at the reviewers who make it  sound like these are the reasons they are buying the higher end tablets3) Great product when looked at as an alternative to the more expensive and a bit bigger screen sized tablets, which by the way  are only about an inch bigger, I'd rather save the $2004) Now if you are an advanced user and still reading this review, you know there are ways to root the latest Google OS on this  devise and have it run just as efficiently and smoothly, this bit of info is only meant for tech savvy novices who like me are a bit  lazy but do want the newest OS to run on their investment :)", "Date": "August 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bought this as a  Christmas gift gor my wife, she and I both love it.", "Author": "Milton Harrison", "ReviewID": "R1XOXGHY9D11C7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When my wife came home one day in November and announced that she wanted a Kindle Fire HD, I was a bit taken aback. She told me how one if her co-workers(a fellow nurse) bought hers to work and it was wonderful. First, she went on and on about the beautiful picture and how outstanding it was. She mentioned that they had viewed some movie trailers and the colors were rich and vibrant. She was absolutely smitten by this product. Secondly, she could not believe the sound quality of the speaker system. my wife related to me that she had never heard such high quality sound come out of a \"tablet\" computer. As a matter of fact she had never heard any computer that had  such high quality sound. Thirdly, you could order over a million free books from Amazon, and read those books at your leisure on the beautiful screen. My wife wanted to go out that very next day and buy one. But me, being the type of person that I am reasoned with her that we should investigate this tablet that I had never heard of and compare it to other tablet computers that were on the market to get some kind of idea of how good this computer truly is. I compared the Kindle to the Nook HD+ and the IPad. To my surprise, no matter which website I visited, the Kindle seemed to be the perfect tablet considering its price, size, pixel density, picture quality, sound quality and overall design. Not only was this computer the perfect compromise, it seemed to be the perfect tablet computer for her. I was especially surprised because I consider myself somewhat of a tekkie and had been searching the internet for information on tablet computers for myself.

I spent a lot of hours researching and playing around in best buy searching for the best tablet for me.My main features that i was seeking in a tablet were a near perfect display,fast enough processor to handle games and multitasking,decent speakers,easy to hold in one hand, and less than $450.My wife and I took advantage of the special that Amazon had on the kinkle one day, $50 off an already cheaply priced tablet was the no brainer decision maker for me,after paying the add removal fee and getting a really amazing case i was still under $300.The highlight so far for my kindle fire tablet experience was the prime instant video streaming via micro hdmi-hdmi. The picture was near blue ray quality after video upscaling through my pioneer reciever.I feel as if though anybody could figure out this device, even my parents.The wifi antenna is better than anything ive ever experienced, it was picking up my neighbors wifi 1/8 mile down the road. And the download speed is among the fastest ive seen.My favorite game plants vs zombies looks great and doesnt drop frames when the battle gets intense.The picture quality is absolutely amazing, the blacks are rich and dark, the white is white not blue like in most samsung screens, and the colors are vibrant and crisp.My only gripe that i have with amazon and the kindle fire as of this time is that i cannot take advantage of the free video streaming because my wife is the primary on the account and i am the guest. I would need to upgrade as a prime member also. So customer service said if i wanted to i could become the primary but there is a possability that one would not get there money back. So i think i am just gonna bite the bullet and upgrade, in augaust when my wifes contract is up i will cancel hers.Update: I am still loving the kindle fire, the battery last me all day long with heavy use and charges 100% in a little over 3 hours with the fast charger.", "Date": "December 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "LOVE IT!!", "Author": "A.

It really is just an incredible tablet.The screen and picture quality are really nothing short of stunning.Bright,crisp,rich colors with an amazing resolution.The sound is first rate too.After setting up my wireless router,I was enjoying my Kindle Fire and all of it's wonderful features.Viewing movies is a great experience.Surfing the web is also excellent.Lightening fast browsing.The tablet itself is very thin and has a \"well made\" feel to it.The battery is very long lasting from my experience.I honestly wish that I could have given this product 10 stars.The size is perfect.A 7\" tablet is too small to fully enjoy,while a 10\" tablet is too large for true portability.The 8.9\" is perfection.As for choosing the Kindle Fire over other brands of tablets,to me the choice was easy.An iPad tablet can not match the viewing experience for watching movies.The Kindle Fire leaves the iPad in the dust.Widescreen movies are viewed on the Kindle Fire in true 16:9 ratio,where as they are displayed on the iPad in 4:3 ratio with black bars on the bottom and top greatly diminishing the viewing experience.Not to mention the dual Dolby speakers on the Kindle Fire blows the iPad single speaker away.Simply put,the iPad costs double what the Kindle Fire does and has an inferior 4:3 display for widescreen movies and far inferior sound.The Kindle Fire's \"brightness\" level is beyond belief.It rates \"higher\" on tests than virtually any other tablet on the market.This is a very important quality in a tablet,although seldom gets mentioned in reviews.Amazon has a true winner with the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" tablet.I honestly can not understand why some would rate this tablet with a poor review.In my opinion,it has to be one of four things. 1).Their wireless connection is less than stellar (you can't blame the tablet for this).2).They are die hard Apple fans who paid double for their iPads and refuse to admit that a tablet actually exists that is as good (or) better at half the cost.3).They failed to read the product details such as not including the wall charger.4).Some people will simply not be happy with any product.In conclusion,I feel that my purchase was one of the wisest decisions I have ever made.For those looking for an incredible tablet that is about as close to perfection as can be on this earth,look no further than the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\".You will love it.", "Date": "December 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "ScreenDim saved the kindle fire HD", "Author": "Manoranjan", "ReviewID": "R2O2MQKR4K60XK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have owned the second generation kindle and this is my first kindle fire. I have been using this for close to 3 months now and my review is below:Size (4 stars):* The size is good for me to read books and watch videos.* Since I read more books than watch videos I might have preferred the apples iPad dimensions probably better (little more wider). However it is also much costlier than the fire.Screen (3 stars):* Screen is very good and crisp.* Sometimes I feel I pressed a link but it will actually press the one below - so not very accurate to touch. This is sometimes annoying.* It is really bright to read at night when the lights are turned off - even when the brightness settings is set to the lowest. This was the biggest deal breaker for me. However the screen dim app saved the kindle and I did not send it back. That is the best app for the kindle for my usage.Power button (3 stars):* The power button is placed in the top of the kindle almost very hard to find without looking at it.Software (1 star):* The software is just horrible. They have heavily customized android as many know. It has crashed on me close to 10 times in the last 3 months. The whole device will suddenly become unresponsive and it will automatically restart after 2 to 3 minutes.* I was looking forward to use the silk browser after I saw the amazon demo. It was easily the worst browser so far. It crashes almost all the time. I am now using the dolphin browser which is decent.* Many people complain about the carousel (homepage) but I think I got used to it now.* Accessing amazon's content is awesome - they have done that very well. It is easy to access videos, books, etc. I believe this was the primary purpose for the kindle when amazon built it probably. This is excellent.* Email app - It is not good and I dont use it. The push notifications of gmail did not work for me but I did not care to check it since my phone has a much better app than fighting with this.Apps (3 stars):* Apps are very limited to the kindle as many know. I knew this before I bought it so this is ok.* I installed the 1mobile app and that gave me access to almost all the android apps. Many dont work as expected like chrome browser, firefox, etc. However dolphin browser, dropbox and some other apps works. I had to get the apk file of 1mobile and install it - I think they call this process sideloading.Will I recommend it or buy it again:It will be a NO. The software provided is so limited to use for anything else apart from browsing amazon content that paying $249 (I got this in a deal) seems high. If I had known these issues before I would have probably went for the iPad mini or a prev generation iPad by paying a little extra. If the only reason you buy is to access amazon content (which I think many wont) this will be an excellent choice.

It works fairly well, and I've never really had any issues with the quality of the picture and sound. The primary weakness of the kindle is it's horrible creator's app store. In their attempt to force you to use their various cloud services, they heavily limit what you can do on the device.To get around that, I rooted the thing in the first week I had it, allowing me to finally use the play store, which voids the warranty, which I could live with. I uninstalled a few system apps, installed at least 30 apps from the play store, and then a few dozen from the internet itself. After that, I loved this thing, it ran perfectly, I had a really nice collection of apps and I could watch videos and TV and read ebooks from anywhere, not just amazon.About 2 or 3 days ago, Amazon SCREWED everyone who had their device rooted and installed an OTA update (Which I thought I had disabled with a play store app, kindlefree). They completely upgraded OS, deleted my root backups, re-installed every system app and un-installed all my system apps like play store and supersu. Now around ~20% of my apps don't work, soon to be more most likely if I don't fix it. Needless to say I was angry and called Amazon, they basically told me it sucks but there's nothing they can do.They pretty much ruined the $300 device for me, and apparently this update patched the method of rooting I had used.So let me summarize-Picture is great-Audio is great-Interface is okay-App selection is awful-Customer support is fairly useless regarding kindles", "Date": "August 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Initial Review", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RLUF2ELB1Z8X5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had my new 8.9\" Kindle Fire HD for a couple weeks now and I feel I can make at least some intial comments on the new device.

The new display is very bright and clear and the new speakers sound great when watching a video.Overall, this second generation device seems to address all the critisisms I had of my Kindle Fire 7\", LCD Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offers.  The touch screen is much more accurate and responsive than the original one, the updated Silk web browser is faster and displays non-mobile formated pages much better, and the autocorrection when typing works much better than before.  Even the minor problem of the original, bottom mounted power button has been resolved and it was moved to the top, along with a \"hard\" volume control that maks listening to music or videos much easier.Honestly, at this point I have no real complaints about the device.  The device integrates smoothly and seamlessly with Amazon content (books, movies and music) which is my main use.  Even the much maligned \"ads\" are not at all intrusive and I decided they are not even worth the $15 charge to opt out.

I was toying with the idea of a tablet for awhile and did a lot of side-by-side comparisons by playing with them in stores. I liked the idea of a tablet mainly for media consumption reasons. I like ebooks (I also have an older eReader), I stream lots of movies and content from Netflix/Hulu+ and have an audible membership. Games are funner to play on bigger screens too. For these needs, the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" is perfect. It has a nice screen resolution, the sound quality is excellent and gets really loud when you need it to. The dual band means that it is kicking my laptop's butt in streaming quality, especially in my bedroom where the wifi in our house drops out a bit. My laptop is usually hiccuping in there, while my kindle runs smoothly. And you know what, the price is right too! I am also an amazon prime member so being able to check out kindle books and have access to other free content is nice. The Prime Video content isn't that different from what Netflix has but it's still a nice bonus. Screen is a perfect size too. It's big enough so that it doesn't have that \"I'm reading on a giant cell phone\" feeling that you get from 7\" tablets. And pretty much the perfect device to sync all of my other amazon content to- for instance, I already used my cloud drive extensively for documents, buy mainly amazon music, and am an audible member. On my iPhone, I can stream my amazon content, but not purchase any additional content, and even if you download it from your cloud drive, on an apple device, you can't access it through anything but the app that downloaded it. I always thought that was lame and was one of the reason I didn't want an iPad.Cons to the device: The camera is a bit lacking (reminds me of the camera on my first cameraphone) but still functional. App library is not nearly as extensive as the android or apple app store. (some work arounds available for android apps though0- think getjar). Lack of expandable media really bugs me. I mean, even apple, who is notorious about locking people out of their devices, offers a camera (SD) card reader as an accessory. I have yet to see that for kindle, which is disappointing because otherwise this would be in my camera bag all the time. I will just have to try to find a solution that works with the micro usb port. So no, this is not an iPad 4, but then again, it costs about $200 less so I think these are fair trades.

When my co-worker purchased his Kindle Fire HD 8.9, we did a basic side by side compare, and the Kindle just blew the IPAD 2 out of the water in picture quality.  We played the same movie side by side, and it was a pronounced difference.The biggest difference to me is the download speed, which a lot of people might dismiss.  I did a unscientific test and downloaded the same episode of big bang theroy on my ipad and then seperatly on my kindle.  Standing in the same spot right beside my router.  The kindle downloaded the episode in just over 5 minutes, then IPAD 2 took 21 minutes.  I was blown away.  While I don't expect these types of results typically, the kindle HD is consistently faster no matter what network I am on.  To me that made the kindle worth the upgrade right there.

This is annoying to say the least. I never realized how much stuff uses flash until I didn't have it. This often results in YouTube videos not functioning. There is allegedly a work-around involving using the Dolphin browser instead of Silk, but I'm not savvy enough to get it to function. If you're a techno-peasant like me, you'll have to learn to live with spotty YouTube application or get someone to configure it for you.Reading books on the Fire is far better than I expected it to be. Which leads me to a related issue. The Amazon prime membership has many great perks, but the \"kindle owners lending library\" is not one of them. Meaning, the selection of free monthly books is horrible. With the exception of the three Hunger Games series books and some classics, it's a bunch of trash no one has ever heard of, much of it bordering on porn. Forget \"borrowing\" a free book that's a best seller, not going to happen. Expect to pay $10-$13 for most anything you'd find at a bookstore.On a brighter note, the Prime live movie streaming is flawless! With the purchase of a $6 micro-usb cable you can connect your Fire HD to your HDTV and watch crystal clear, no stuttering, HD movies. The selection of free stuff is not super current/just released, but still very good.My point is, don't get lost in the advertising hype. No tablet does everything.

We're a pretty digital group, with many PCs, an assortment of laptops, this Kindle, iMacs, several iPod iterations, a smaller Android tablet and a Transformer, and a very wide, full assortment of smart phones (S3, G2x etc.), so a weakling is quickly routed out and abandoned.  And yes - they are all capable of playing nicely with each other on our network (no easy feat).The Kindle is simply perfect for what it is, and performs at least as well as we had hoped.  The display is rich and compelling and the ergonomics are good.  The Amazon flavored Android is glitch free, and while some settings are veiled, with some time they can be found and optimized.  For Amazon content, it is very nearly perfect; the delivery speed is excellent and the chance of a kid or uninformed adult accidentally screwing things up is minimal.  The Free Time is what sets it apart, and in a VERY good way.  Our teenagers have Android tablets also, but the younger kids would have no idea how to manipulate settings or install anything if it involved anything more than a click, so we got this purposely for a 7 (8 in days) and a 9 y/o to be able to read books, watch appropriate videos, play some learning type games and, in a perfect world, learn something while having fun.  They continually bicker over my wife's iMac and tie up the main TV on Netflix, so we wanted to get them their own devices, namely this and a Win8 laptop.

The trades between the new laptop and the Kindle are carefully negotiated affairs, and the only user complaint is the time it takes to recharge when the battery dies (and it IS used until the battery dies every single time).The one disappointment (beside the missing SD slot we knew about beforehand) is the difficulty of accessing the PlayStore on the Kindle.  It was fairly easy to get the Amazon content onto the Asus tablets, but another thing entirely going the other way.  This brings to light the main difference between the Kindle and any other tablet; while the Android units are more or less designed to be easy to change, root, mod, and restore if it goes south, the Kindle is not.  Being under warranty has prevented  any attempt to root it, and they've done an admirable job of making the garden walls high and sturdy. I'm sure that at some point a non invasive method of getting PlayStore apps to run will be figured out, but for now (given the ages of the main users), Amazon has everything we need on this device, and with Free Time, there is very little chance they'll access inappropriate content or brick the unit itself.  We also have iProducts galore, so the notion of controlled access and throttled content is not new to us, but at the same time, there ARE some things on PlayStore that have no equivalent on Amazon, and it would be nice to be able to access them on the Kindle too.The sound is MUCH better quality than any other tablet (and 99% of the laptops), but due to the sheer number of devices in use at any given time, headphones are the norm here.The bottom line is that the display is absolutely gorgeous, the download speeds are excellent, the content is great (and growing), and the technical skills needed to use it are nil.  For tech averted adults or growing kids, this is the ideal tablet.  It never hangs, crashes or misbehaves like it's speedier, more adaptable but less stable counterparts, and Free Time alone should warrant a very close look if you have younger kids (or a technophobe) in the house.", "Date": "January 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "20 3/4 stars!", "Author": "Shanks", "ReviewID": "R3KHD2A26BLJX8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this for my wife...

Silk slows down a lot and begins to shutdown your previously opened webpages. When you return to them it reloads everything again so you lose information you've already typed in. For example: filling out forms or cc info. The Facebook app stinks. You can only see a few posts and the rest is blued out.

Amazon introduced the 8.9 inch which is perfect for reading and perfect for the internet.The only issue I had was it would not open my email due to the lack of flash player. So I had to sideload flash with the dolphin broswer. This is very simple to do and YOU DO NOT HAVE TO ROOT OR JAIL BREAK THIS TO DO THIS. So you still keep the manufactures warranty. You just have to check the box under your settings to allow 3rd party applications. Then download dolphin and flash, or safari and flash or whatever android browser you like to use as the flash will not work with the silk browser. The kindle still updates with all of amazons new updates. Picture quality is amazing, touch screen is ultra responsive, browser is very fast, and sound is clear and loud. The weight of this kindle is the same as my older first generation kindle fire, that my 2 year old now inherited.I also purchased a blue tooth keyboard and a stylus for this one so I use it like a netbook. I purchased the ad version that displays an ad everytime you take it out of sleep mode. At any time if you don't want the ads you can sign into your account and pay to have the ads removed. They don't bother me so I left the ad's on. Thank You again Amazon for another amazing kindle.

Great value for the money!I bought one for myself and one for my 26 year old daughter and we're both very pleased. We decided we didn't need a full featured tablet, since we already have powerful ultra-light notebooks and top-of-the-line smartphones, so this fit nicely into our needs. Great as an eBook reader, with very good media options for listening, watching, and generic internet access (including emails).The initial set-up of the Kindle HD Fire was fast, easy, and intuitive. My daughter & I both downloaded books from Amazon's library and were impressed at the ease & speed. I downloaded a 6 novel set of Tom Clancy books (7-12) in a matter of seconds. We also \"upgraded\" the Kindle to 32GB, paid $15 more for the \"without special offers\" option, and glad we did.The only (minor) complaint I have is the PowerFast charger is extra and not included in box, Fortunately I already knew this, with some advanced research, and we made sure to buy the charger (at a discounted price) with when buying the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\".

I might have given the tablet 5 stars if it were not for the ads and plugin charger. Note to Amazon: just increase the price up front and take care of these two complaints.My family has five Kindle products (Keyboard, Paperwhite, Fire, Fire HD 7\" and, of course, the Fire HD 8.9\") and we like all five especially the Fire HD's. On the 8.9\" the extra screen size really makes watching movies more enjoyable and reading is better. I was really surprised by how much more I enjoyed reading because of the screen size (not to mention the HD resolution). It is just easier on the eyes. The new screen also has less reflection than the old Fire.The camera addition is a good one. We enjoy using Skype for family contact and find the camera resolution to be very good.The dolby sound on the 8.9\" is great. You can enjoy movies, music or games without earbuds and/or sound boosters. The dynamics are super, too.As this tablet has the best processor of the Kindles it is more responsive even though I find surfing the web to be a bit sluggish at times. Still a nice improvement over lesser Kindle models as one would expect.This is a good size for a tablet for the things noted above, but I find it a bit large and heavy for reading in bed. You will agree if you doze off as I did and have it thunk you in the head.

(But don't all 1st gens do?)I now have the newest kindle; I bought the Cadillac of the series, with all the bells and whistles, and as much storage capacity as it offered.First the Pros:1 The picture is beautiful; crystal clear resolution, and great color.2. The interface is a little different than the first Fire, but it was easy enough to learn.3. The picture size is a LOT better, both for watching movies, and for playing games like \"Bad Piggies\".4. Both the case and the unit are very sturdy- I've dropped it a couple of times, and no harm at all!5. The X-Ray option is great!  I don't have to worry about reaching for my iPhone to use Google to look up the Actor's bio. (Haven't used the text-to-speech yet, so I can't comment on this feature.)6. I like the fact that the display stays on, if you want it while the film plays.  (How long left to go in the film, battery life, 10 sec. \"rewind\" option.) I like to pause films all the time, and the fact it stays on makes it easier to do so.7. Being a Prime member, there's so much free content, it's fantastic!8. I love the fact that the Fire can be put to sleep by just closing the cover- very efficient.Now for the Cons:1. I realize that the speakers can't be large, but your ads are very misleading about their power.  This is one of the main reasons I bought the new Kindle Fire, because the first one was too hard to hear without headphones.  So much for the portable advantage.While the speakers are louder than the first one, they still have a LONG way to go to live up to your hype.  Even some of your own guides you offer say headphones are the best way to listen.2. Who was the design genius who decided to put the charger on the bottom?  When my Fire's getting low on power, I can't use the case to prop it up, because the charger is in the way! I have to lay it flat- once again, not the most watchable experience. The first version had it right- the charger was on the side; no need to change.3. I guess the same design genius decided we don't need a charging light that is visible, either.  I like to know when my machines are charging by having an indicator to look at.  (I can see if it's charging when I wake it up, but I still like an indicator when it's asleep, like the old one.)4. I have yet to successfully establish by connection with AT&T.;  When I put in my password, it tells me I need my last four digits of my SS number.  When I put in my SS number, I cannot add my password, when I do, the SS number disappears.5.There is an option to back up ten seconds in playback.  Couldn't there be an option to skip ahead about the same time period?Well, for what it's worth, that's my review of the Kindle Fire 8.9\" HD.  Not perfect by any means, but still one heck of a lot of fun!  Amazon will always be one of my favorite places to shop!EDITED ON 12-14-12I found a good work-around for the problem of the charger being on the bottom.  I bought a cheap stand that is used for holding decorative plates.  The Kindle fits perfectly on the stand, with plenty of room for the charger to be plugged in.I've only used it in the horizontal position, though.  The vertical seems a bit too unstable for my liking.  Now, on to trying to boost the speakers...EDITED ON 4-23-14The only way I've found to improve the speakers was to add external portable speakers.  The ones I've found to be the best are ROKONO.  I'm sure others are as good, but, in my experience, these are very good, with long lasting battery life, and decent sound.  I usually use two, because I use the Kindle mainly in the kitchen, with the washer, dryer, and running water noise to overcome.Another problem- I'm a Prime member, and use the free streaming shows quite a bit.  I often get an \"error code 13\"- can't play the video at this time.  This is SO frustrating.  I know it's not my internet connection, because the same video will play with no problem on my Mac.But all-in-all, it's still not a bad unit.", "Date": "December 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "best tablet for the price", "Author": "robert orona", "ReviewID": "R3EW1VIZK5KED6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "awesome speed, the graphics are great.

I could not blog for hours on nuances of android operating systems or systemic differences between Nexus 7 vs. Fire HD.  I am the average user that wants a tablet but hates to be tied to Apple and its runaway proprietary chain that comes with all of their products.  I had the original Kindle and the subsequent Fire and I liked both for what they were, simple...more so for Kindle, a little less so for the Fire.  The Fire was buggy.  I have found my Fire HD is also buggy.Problems:Web Browser: I received the notice that my web browser was not responding, this happened 7 times within a few minutes until I was forced to restart my browser.  It was a nuisance out of the gate when I am simply trying to read the news.Google:  It appears the only way I am able to voice/video chat is through Skype, which means I have to subscribe to another service and pay a fee for a number.  I know Skype is great and useable around the globe...so is Google+/video chat.  There is no Amazon App to use Google+/video chat.  Also the web browsing version is scaled down to the point where I cannot actually web chat through the browser.LTE:  My mistake but, I thought part of the increased payment for the HD W/4G LTE was the initial year of 4G service for $50.00; a great deal.  I did not know that I still had to pay the $50 after the fact.  Small sure, but all these small things begin to compound.Not problems:The screen is so much more vivid.  External controls are a major plus.  Sound is fantastic, and battery life is quite good.So if the above problems do not factor against you, I think you will be pretty happy with the Fire HD.  If you are like me and stopped using ITunes, have a Prime account, and order almost everything from Amazon, the HD is a great purchase. Unfortunately Fire HD is less functional than I need it to be.  Otherwise it is a great piece of gear and you should Fire HD!Some updates after further use:Problem:Power and Volume Buttons: Simply put they are too close, I shut off the screen a couple time while trying to adjust the volume.  Perhaps in the next iteration, these buttons are on either side of the tablet.Not Problems:Ads:  I have noticed the ads but not found them to be a major distraction to my use of the Fire HD.  I get the ad at start up and I believe I have seen the ad one other time but it was not a distraction from my overall Fire activities.Silk:  Since the initial bugginess, I have not experienced any further problems...I don't browse a lot with the Fire (thus far).  I am a creature of habit and go to the same sites or apps over and over again.Apps: yes, I do miss some of my Apple Apps, mostly I miss AutoBlog.  I am not a real car guy but that app excited me because it distills the important car info that has come out without having to trek through a dense website.  Other apps, I don't miss and most of the good ones I get: Stumble upon, Flipboard, Shazam, etc...Google integration:  I like the instantaneous integration on my Google calendar, address book, Gmail throughout my Samsung galaxy III Smartphone, Fire HD, and Apple Computer.  I still miss Google+ video chat on the Fire HD, I have to do that on my phone.WiFi Streaming: I watched a full HD movie last night via Prime, I have the lowest data speed via my internet provider...no buffering, no diminished picture; it was a fantastic experience.  The image quality of the screen and the movie was simply amazing.  The volume never distorted through the speakers during loud scenes or heavy bass.  Same goes with streaming music, never a problem, fantastic sound quality.HD Port:  I have yet to try this but, I like the idea that I can plug this into my HD TV and stream Prime, I will let you know how the picture quality translates.", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "I love it!", "Author": "Victoria I.

And now it even underlines your miss spelled words in red so you can correct them!*Amazon Silk browser is faster & more compatible with different websites.

Which means I can't view videos on some websites, because Adobe is no longer making it for Android or mobile devices. Which means on older websites that still use flash instead of HTML5 you cannot view videos.

The only thing you can't disable is the ad's that show up on the screen when it's locked.All in all I'm quite happy with my new Kindle Fire HD 8.9.

I already had a Kindle KB charger and a cell phone charger both of which work fine with my 8.9\" device.  That said, I am really liking this device.  The color is fantastic, sound is great and have learned very quickly how to navigate on it.  The only thing I don't like is the carousel.  I would prefer to have a desktop like on my PC and have apps and websites represented by icons.  Tapping would open an app or connect to a website.  I sent feedback on this to Amazon today.  One minor complaint about a couple of apps I downloaded:  tried to open them multiple times but each time they would quit working.  I paid a small charge for one but the other was free.  Have not watched any videos or movies but probably will over the Thanksgiving weekend.  All in all, Amazon, a great device!  Oh, and one more thing, somebody please, please make the Scrabble app work on the KFHD.It is Dec 7 and I have had my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" for 3 weeks. I had a few minor problems figuring the device out but managed fine on my own (I am 83) and have everything resolved.  The Battery HD app works well to keep up with battery charging.  I am enjoying game apps and have watched movies (since my earlier review).  My only difficulty is that my hearing is very bad and I have to use earphones to be able to hear dialog in movies. The control buttons are not a problem and I know exactly which port is for the USB charger. I still give it 5 stars.

Several of my games are not loading correctly and shutting down, or will not allow me to link with Facebook.Other than those small problems, I'm loving the new HD!As a side note, if you do purchase the Fire HD, make sure you purchase the Kindle \"Power Fast\".  The device does not come with a plug in to charge via wall outlet.  Instead, it comes with the USB tethering cable and that is it.Edit*Since my original review, I have removed the \"Special Offers\".  It was a bit tedious trying to figure out how to remove them.  In order to remove them, you have to sign in to Amazon and find the link that takes you to the management of your Kindle.  From there, you can rename the device and remove the offers.  Because I had the original Kindle Fire when I activated the new HD, the HD had \"(my name)'s 2nd Kindle\".  I was happy to change it to just \"(my name)'s Kindle\".One con that I have found with the Fire HD is the buttons are a bit tricky to turn the device on and off.  I do like that there is an external volume control, but the button to bring it out of \"sleep\" is so small.  I have seen cases that will automatically put the device to sleep or wake it up when using it, but I chose to go with a more durable case.Also, the Kindle Fire HD had some sort of \"upgrading\".  Once it was complete, the apps that I had been having issues with closing down have been resolved.

After I put the device through its paces, I will update.PROS:- Really impressed with the out of the box functionality.  Very little setup required. I'm very tech savvy, but it is really nice when a device comes out of the box, drops a software update and is ready to rock in minutes.  Very slick.- E-Mail, Web, other basics very easy to set up- App store (what it contains) works well and in 10 minutes I had my basics (Weather, Vevo, Netflix, HBO GO, Pandora and Myfitnesspal) downloaded and running- Sound is very nice both via speakers and headphones.  I can really tell the difference in speaker quality between this Kindle and my wife's Ipad 2- File transfer -- particularly music -- is really easy.  All my itunes purchased music (except the odd drm stuff) is dropping right onto the device and playing.- Music plays while reading with no work arounds or issues (maybe I'm dating myself here, but this was a huge issue on many of the devices I've had over the years)- Form factor, weight, etc. works just fine -- two points I have huge hands and I bought a case so your experience may not match, but this easily works for me as a tablet and e-reader on the \"holdability\" side- e-reader works well and screen does not bother me for reading (glare, etc.)WAITING TO SEE- The carousel function of display takes some getting use to -- but it is growing on me as I learn to quickly add and delete.- Screen resolution for videos looks good so far, but for me the proof is in the longer term viewing (i.e. do I give up and just wait to fire up the big screen because it feels fuzzy / low resolution).  This more of a feel factor for me -- so it will take some viewing hours to determine.- Reading on the screen.  I'm not giving up my old kindle yet for reading books -- I'll have to see if the screen works long term- Video files -- I've attempted no file transfers yetCONS- Limited android application download.  I've had this less than 6 hours and it already bugs me that I can't download apps from Google Play and/or that many applications are unavailable. If you are an android application freak and/or can't live without X -- check before you buy and think carefully.- Charging.  When plugged into my computer there is nothing but a trickle charge -- you really do need the amazon charger which, given they don't include in the package, is a negative.- No desktop management software.  I intend to use this device as one of my primary multi-media consumption platforms, it would be nice to have some (even stripped down) desktop software to manage books, music, videos etc. I'm fine with opening the device directory and dropping in, but some automation and management would have been really nice.I will update after I play with the device, use around town, and try and use bluetooth keyboards etc., but so far this device is a very solid hand-held multi-media tablet.", "Date": "November 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "worst tablet", "Author": "Charles", "ReviewID": "R2GLMWG699XXCF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is the first review I have ever writen. being a long time amazon costumer and Kindle user I thought I'dd give the Fire a try.

I'd love to hear the real reason why these apps don't make it on to the Amazon-approved list (got something to do with money? royalties, maybe?).The main screen design is okay, although it would be great to have more control over the items that appear in the carousel, so that I can tailor the items readily available on my main screen, kind of like every other Android device in existence.

If So, You May Also Ejoy Using Kindle Fire", "Author": "HJW \"o8Heather8o\"", "ReviewID": "R2HA2KXSD40Z5Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "By this point in time, all that should be said about the 8.9\" Kindle Fire HD has already been said by other reviewers, so I will comment on some of the unique aspects of my experience with it.First & foremost, if you're undecided about getting one, I would say, ask yourself this... \"How much do you enjoy hanging out at Amazon's website?  How often do you visit their site, & what do you like to do when you're here?  Do you prefer visiting a different bookstore's site?\"  I would recommend the Kindle Fire 8.9\" HD to you if your answer runs along the lines of, \"I log into Amazon almost every single day, usually at least several times a week...& I get lost online here...I lose hours just immersed in all of the different 'cool stuff' there is to see & read about here.  A huge percentage of the things I can't buy locally, I buy from Amazon...& I admit that I dig hanging out on their website, just checking things out & maybe commenting on them.\"I say this not because we're all going to shop ourselves into sweet oblivion on this tablet (although at times we may), but because if you like visiting Amazon.com & spending time in Amazon's unique \"ecosystem\" in general, & if you like what it \"feels like\" to be here - you will probably also enjoy the new Kindle Fire HD.  If you like the feel of hanging out in an ever-changing atmosphere & look forward to seeing what's new at this particular \"virtual bookstore\" - it's likely you may also like spending time on its tablet too.  It's easy to either like or dislike both Amazon & this tablet for the same reasons.  Because I very much like Amazon's site, I immediately liked this tablet - because it offers that familiar feeling of \"cruising Amazon,\" & being able to take the entire contents of your digital account there with you, wherever you go.  My one wish that would make it perfect...is if it served fresh cappuccino lattes from a virtual espresso bar.  :) Ah well, I can dream.All of which leads to Amazon's excellent continuing tech support.  With many tablets, & the manufacturer will help you to set it up, & iron out any initial technical issues, then after that - you're on your own.  Which is Ok.  But if you have an issue with an item on your Kindle Fire HD, Amazon's Kindle Customer Service Dept. is just a phone call away, 24/7.  This has been quite handy, & they've stood behind their product with me so far.  As an example, for some reason I could not access over half of my music downloads, & they helped me to retrieve all of my purchases, so I can hear them as I read.  Help with malfunctioning apps ordered from Amazon is also a huge plus.  So far I am impressed, & I hope this does not change.I read some dour complaints about this Kindle Fire's limitations as a tablet, & really expected nothing more than a glorified eReader & a portable iHeart Radio & Netflix machine, & that was Ok with me.  I am graduating from the \"Kindle 3G With Keys,\" & I chose it.  But what really surprised me, was how much I can actually DO on it...besides access all my books.  There's basic internet & email access, which is a must, & I also insisted on smooth, high-def video Netflix access.  But if you're a casual gamer & an e-gadget lover, there are SO many nifty & often free apps available to you, that you may forget to even open your books...  I have a nice collection really great books, but in the 5 weeks that I've owned this Kindle, I have actually have spent more time goofing off with my apps (like issuing howls of laughter at smashing things in \"Let's Break Stuff!\" Premium)...than I actually have reading.  And new & interesting apps are arriving each & every day.  In fact, Amazon offers Kindle Fire owners a \"Free App Of The Day\" daily for your consideration & enjoyment.  Some of the stuff you'll see featured there is creative & amazing...& some not.  But it's always fun to look forward to seeing what's next tomorrow.  If these ideas appeals to you (& you don't really just wish you could buy an iPad, but are settling for a Kindle)...you may really enjoy the 8.9\" Kindle Fire HD.Also, I am impressed with the screen sensitivity.  I have tried tablets that I really had to *press* on hard, to get to respond.  In my experience, I find that the better the quality is of the tablet stylus I use, the better & faster the screen responds to it.  And the more cheaply made the stylus is, the more poorly it performs.  For me, using a different stylus (even though they may look almost identical) results in differing performance that is almost like using 2 different tablets.  When selecting a stylus, go with \"what feels right in your hand\".  Stylus reviews are hit & miss, & only you will know what's right for you.  It's cheap of them but probably just as well that Amazon does not include a stylus with this tablet, because half the people would probably hate it...although it would be nice for emergencies when your stylus of choice has wandered elsewhere.Those are the pros, now for the cons...I actually give this tablet 4 1/2 Stars primarily because it needs to use a little faster processing speed than what it comes with, for what it's trying to do.  It's good enough for most average functions, but if you're used to technology that really flies, you may feel a slight sense of lag with the 8.9\" Kindle Fire HD.Also, the price gouging on the 32GB version of this tablet & the deliberate lack of an SD card port, is a major issue.  You can always keep most of your less frequently used books, music, & apps in your \"Amazon Cloud\"...but it's amazing how eerily fast the memory in that 16GB (part of which is taken up by the O/S) starts to fill up.  I never thought I'd use so much internal memory so fast, but after a few weeks, the increased memory usage is sneaking up on me like an evening shadow.  If you generally use up a lot of external memory in other areas of your life (eg. PC, phone, cameras, etc.)...you may want to bite the bullet & get the 32GB version of this tablet, just for the greater elbow room.  I wish I had, but I was too stubborn to pay for it.  That said, I actually would have paid the 32GB price if what it offered instead was an external SD memory card port capable of accessing cards up to 64GB.  That price I could live with.Furthermore, I give it 4 1/2 Stars due to its average battery life.  Like my cordless phone, my Kindle Fire HD always seems to be on the charger.  I would like a tablet that can do this much to hold a charge 30-50% longer than mine does.  Also, it came with a USB cable, but when I plug it into the PC to access it, it actually loses charge, instead of gaining it.  That's unfortunate, because after I use & unplug it at my PC, I still have to charge it from my wall outlet.  IMO...that's just wrong.  And the PC USB charging that occurs during \"sleep mode\" has been barely noticeable.Also, if you decide to purchase this tablet, I highly recommend also getting a supportive, well-constructed cover.  You will not \"love\" all of the covers out there (believe me...) but using this tablet \"bare\" feels very risky for a device of this value, & I highly recommend protecting your new investment with a Kindle cover that you can at least \"like\".  For this purpose, I prefer the over-priced bonded (Ok, barely) leather cover that Amazon makes Amazon Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" Standing Leather Case, Royal Purple - even though the color actually arrived a murky \"burgundy\"...because I have tried equally expensive covers much worse.  Amazon's cover focuses on durability, surrounding & cradling their new Kindle HD with rubber bumpers on all 4 sides, to see it more safely see the bumps & clunks of life on the move.  Short of a \"Nerf Cover,\" this magnetized cover will offer protection for your Kindle if you hope to toss it into your purse or tote bag, to take with you on the go.  It's also good if you tend to absent-mindledly bump things around while your mind races onto its next great idea, Kindle in hand.  For me, the sleep/wake cover feature really was its best selling point.  No matter what you do though, make sure you find this device a good cover that you can live with.  Because even though it's not flimsy, life will happen to it.Overall...  I give the 8.9\" Kindle Fire HD tablet 4 1/2 Stars, because if Amazon were a real brick & mortar book store...I would probably live there...sipping lattes & eating scones in a wireless hot spot.  And because during my free time, this Kindle Fire has practically been my right hand since it arrived, & it's been hard to put down.  Also, the round the clock tech support has been great.  But I believe somewhat higher specs should have been offered for this device to match its capabilities, & at reasonable prices.", "Date": "January 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Better than the original", "Author": "Noname", "ReviewID": "RRVE50PDAHK7A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have the original Kindle Fire.  When my husband asked me what I want for Christmas, I told him a Fire HD 8.9\".  I got to play with my present early, and it is so worth it.SETUPSetup was a cinch.  It came registered to my account.  I just had to turn it on.  There was a short tour on screen, but I barely looked at it.  I can't even tell you what it said.  If you've had a Fire, this is just as easy.  Your favorites are at the bottom of the screen when you press the star.  Swipe from the top down to get at the settings.  Swipe back up to bring back your screen.BETTER THAN THE ORIGINALThe main reason I wanted the Fire HD is the larger screen.  I read a lot, and the larger screen size is so much kinder on the eyes.  Videos and photos are also much more vivid, and they stream smoothly.The new Fire HD has Bluetooth technology.  Finally, I can pair it with my Bluetooth keyboard and my Bluetooth speakers.  They make the tablet experience so much richer.Also included is a camera on the screen side facing the user.  I downloaded the free Photo Editor app to take advantage of it.  Too bad the camera isn't on the other side.  I'd find that more useful, but a front facing camera is better than no camera.Other advantages are external volume control buttons and a power button located on the *top* of the Fire.  No more accidentally turning the screen off.WiFi is very good.  While the WiFi signal on my old Fire keeps cutting out, the one on my Fire HD is constant and strong.SOME DRAWBACKSI don't care for the placement of the micro USB port along the longer side.  My cases and sleeves open at the top, so I can't charge the Fire HD while it's in the case because of the location of the power port.Also, although most of my apps that I use on my old Fire could be downloaded on the Fire HD, a few of them are not compatible.Flash is not supported.  This has not been a problem for me, but it may concern others.  I've run into a few instances where video wouldn't play, but I can live with that.  There are workarounds, but it's more work than I care for.Lastly, bigger means it won't fit in my purse.  We can't have it all.WITH SPECIAL OFFERSI got the Fire HD with special offers.  It gives me a beautiful ad at the startup screen.  No big deal.  I was hoping for coupons, but I'll take the ads.  So far, they have all been pleasing to the eye.CONCLUSIONI'm so happy I got a Fire HD.  It really is an upgrade from the original.

That is customer service when clearly they did not have to agree.  For this reason I am sticking with Amazon.This is a wonderful device for folks that love to consume media, and want a portable and easy to use product.  We have both a 7 and 8.9 HD versions now.  The extra screen size does mean a little more in size and weight but may be easier to read and view movies, etc.  I find that by double clicking the 7 inch I can easily increase  my text so this is not really an issue.I described my experience with the first 7 inch HD that I had to return and am monitoring the new one to see if the same problem develops.  However, I do not consider this issue to be a deal breaker.  Basically I have multiple email accounts and when I would check them from time to time, inevitably at least 1 would give me a connection error.

Time to compare and contrast. My Kindle is a reading device first and foremost for me. My husband's relationship with his iPad is much more \"intimate.\" He does more with his iPad than I do with my Kindle and is his constant companion when he is on the road.  I watch the occasional movie or other video content on my Kindle via Hulu and Amazon Prime Instant video, check e-mail, and of course visit Facebook. Sadly Facebook does not look as good on the Kindle as it does on the iPad.  I know that's an app issue, but if you're a Facebook addict, that might be a factor for you to consider when deciding on what sort of tablet device to buy.  The \"Silk\" browser is a bit clunky compared to Chrome or Safari, but it's okay for the occasional search, but for \"deep searches\" I put down my Kindle and fire up my MacBook Pro and do serious work there.The Kindle HD is perfect for reading, video viewing, and light web browsing and of course......shopping on Amazon!Well, I finally got a tablet device.  Being a long time Apple computer owner currently with my fourth Mac, and owner of an iPhone, one would think I'd automatically go for an iPad.  Nope.  I decided to patiently wait for the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" to come out. I pre-ordered mine in September and it arrived a week before Thanksgiving.....sooner than expected!I bought the Kindle because I like the Amazon \"ecosystem\" better than the iTunes \"ecosystem\" for purchasing and renting various media.  What music I have lives on my iPhone and it is music I've burned from CDs I already own. So music portability and storage is not that big a deal for me.  What is important is access to books, magazines, video, and movies and TV.  I like how Amazon presents its content better than the way iTunes does.Technically the Kindle Fire HD pulls in the wifi signal from the other side of our 1800 square foot house better than my iPhone and Macbook Pro do.  Perhaps its the dual antennae in the Kindle. I'm no tech geek, so I'm just guessing there.  The HD picture quality is spectacular.  I rented and viewed Tim Burton-Johnny Depp's \"Dark Shadows\" on my Kindle.  The clarity of the image and the colors popped right out as I watched from the cozy comfort of  my bed! I used basic headphones for listening and the audio was also very good.  I've also got a Pandora radio station streaming some of my favorite \"progressive\" rock music from the seventies and eighties. I've also downloaded a couple of free, public domain books to my Kindle and also purchased a Kindle edition of an interesting murder mystery novel.  It does not replace my Macbook Pro, but will be a wonderful traveling companion for portable communications when I don't want to dig out my regular computer.", "Date": "November 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very Happy With the Kindle Fire 8.9\"!", "Author": "christine", "ReviewID": "RUHHLL73Q5O1X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Leaps and bounds over the earlier Kindle Fire.The perfect size screen, smooth performance and comfortable to hold.It's so good I sold my iPad....The new Kindle Fire 8.9 does everything I need.", "Date": "November 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Satisfaction", "Author": "thekfchero", "ReviewID": "RUZPLX3K32CVZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm typing this from my new kindle and I've got to say, I'm thoroughly impressed. This feels like a premium tablet. The screen is vivid and crisp, on par with the iPad. The sound is out of this world. It's actually hard to describe how good the sound is. It's super loud and it really mimics surround sound beautifully. I would also say this tablet is super comfy to hold, even with one hand. It's not too heavy but also carries enough weight so that it doesn't feel like a toy.Of course, there are some caveats. The browser is *slightly* slower than the iPad's but its still a massive improvement over the original Kindle Fire. There is no Flash but no mobile device currently under production runs Flash anymore. Personally, the lock screen ads don't bother me but the \"customers also bought\" on the home screen does piss me off. Fortunately, you can turn this off in the settings. Finally, the app selection leaves something to be desired, but for the most part, there is usually an \"app for that\".Overall, this is an amazing tablet for the price it and goes toe to toe with the iPad 4. If you are willing to forego apps selection for the ultimate tablet media experience, I would totally recommend this tablet over the iPad, the iPad mini, and the Nexus 10.EDITAfter tinkering around with it, I managed to install Chrome onto the device.

Phillips \"tx.parrothead\"", "ReviewID": "R3EZ9MGH16LLNG", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Six hours after I received my new Kindle Fire HD 8.9 it was packed up and ready to return to Amazon.  Read on and I'll tell you why.  I bought this tablet because my 2+ year old Pantech Element suddenly died one day a few weeks ago.  It simply would not power up.  I tried for a week, doing everything I knew and could find out to get it to work, but I concluded after a week it was a lost cause - I'll tell you more about this in a moment.  So I went tablet shopping.  I had a list or requirements:1)  NOT AN IPAD - I will not be a slave of Apple and iTunes.  Before you label me an Apple basher, let me point out we have a Macbook Pro, an iPad Mini and iPhone 4 in our household.  I am not a fanatic, I just feel Android offers much more potential than Apple does.2)  4G capable.3)  External SD card support.4)  An 8\"-9\" screen  -  7\" is too small and the 10+\" are too big.I am a technically able person and this list of requirements didn't seem like it would be too hard to fill.  It turns out it is.  There is virtually nothing out there that will meet every one of those requirements.  Interestingly my beloved Pantech Element does, but it has been discontinued.  After a few days of searching I decided I was going to have to compromise on one or more of my requirements.  I settled on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 even though it did not support an external SD card.  I figured the 32G of internal memory would make up for it.  Maybe that would have worked out, I don't know.  There were other issues, one in particular, that would ultimately make that question moot.  Right out of the box, after an hour to update the software, I decided I did not care for the interface.  I realize this is a personal preference, others may love it.  I didn't. Being accustomed to the \"normal\" ICS interface, I found the \"carousel\" too busy/pushy/inflexible for me.  Couldn't change it either, can't even change the wallpaper.  Also the font seemed tiny, fine print on a medicine bottle tiny.  I thought, no problem, I'll go to settings and change it.  Guess what - you can't.  An hour of research on the internet indicated that this can't be changed and seems to be a common complaint.  Amazon customer support confirmed this can't be changed.  After two hours of playing with the tablet, my eyes literally ached.  At that point I decided this had to go back.  I can't enjoy this tablet and this was a deal breaker for me.  But there are some good points about this tablet.  I give my opinion of the good and bad below.  These are only my views and may differ from yours.  I offer them only as points for consideration:Pros:32G internal memory (almost makes up for the lack of SD card support).Nice screen size, 8.9\".The $50, 12 month, 250M data plan is a great value.Cons:Not the most comfortable tablet to hold in one hand, at least for me.  I am used to holding my 8\" Pantech with one hand while reading.  This tablet is more difficult to hold in one hand.  Why don't tablet makers make the back of their tablets with either a textured finish or some kind of non-slip material?No SD card support.  Why is this?  Should be a must for all tablets.Android version locked up tighter than Fort Knox.  I won't say I tried and can't say I didn't, but even rooting this is nearly impossible at this time.  It seems Amazon has gone to great lengths to stop this useful and sometimes necessary practice.Tied to the Amazon Kindle HD app store.  This is a sore spot for me because I don't want to be tied to their app store any more than I want to be held hostage by Apple and iTunes.  See requirement number 1 above.  BTW, Kindle HD app store is sorely lacking in some of the apps I use regularly.  For example, Tom-Tom is not there, Cool Reader (the BEST free e-reading app, bar none, IMO) is not available and many others I use all the time.  And you can't download them as a regular app either, Amazon won't let you, see lock-down comment above.Limited ability to configure the system .  My Pantech was running ICS, 4.0.4, which allowed quite a bit of user control.  Whatever version of Android this device is running (I couldn't tell) will not allow you access to some of the most basic settings.  I could not even change the system font size in the display menu, it's not there.  This leads me to my biggest complaint of all -System font is so small it hurt these middle-age eyes after a couple of hours trying to deal with it and cannot be increased.  This was the deal breaker for me. Yes, within some apps the font size can be changed, but these are generally limited to e-reading apps.  You can't change the font in file manager app, for example.  This applies to most other apps.In conclusion, although there are a number of good things about this tablet, the negatives far outweighed the positives for me.  I also do not believe this good choice for anyone with any kind of vision difficulties.  The text in many, if not most, apps can be difficult to read.  Finally, two days after I ordered the Kindle, my Pantech suddenly came back to life.  It has been working fine ever since.  I still don't know what happened, but I continue my quest for its eventual replacement.  Even at over two years old, consider it a better choice for me than the Kindle Fire HD.", "Date": "April 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "KNOW WHAT YOU WANT", "Author": "Edward G. Taylor \"Nahum 1:7\"", "ReviewID": "R2EH4GJTBUFP13", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" when Amazon had a $50.00 off one-day sale before Christmas.  It has proven well worth the money.  Being money conscious, but somewhat techie oriented, I wanted the quality hardware (high ppi, gorilla glass, fast) and up-to-date OS that this provided without an Apple price tag.The HD 8.9 has proven itself an excellent value.  My needs were pretty basic:  reading-including digital magazine(s),  web surfing, a few specific apps, possibly note taking, games, Amazon Prime Instant Movies.THE GOOD-- I have already read a library book on my HD.  I enjoyed the experience very much.  I ride public transportation (commuter train and bus) to & from work.  The HD has been very nice in all lighting conditions experienced so far.  Time will tell how it does in bright summer sunshine.-- I subscribed to Motorcyclist magazine and it is awesome.  Easy to read...pinch & zoom works great.  Easy to navigate.-- Surfing the web is easy.  I prefer my laptop, but I occasionally use the HD for convenience sake.  I wouldn't want to count on it as my primary web access tool.  I have not yet tried alternate browsers.-- The specific apps I have tried have been excellent quality.  I already knew what I wanted was available for the fire.  I had to sideload some of them, but without rooting the device.  I recommend researching your desired apps before buying to be sure they will work ok on the HD.-- Note taking is dependent on the app.  I find the on-board keyboard too small for my large hands.  I have yet to try out my flex keyboard, but am hoping that will work well. This is my lowest priority use for the HD, so not too important.  I will mention the app itself is excellent.  There are several available.-- The games I have tried are a lot of fun.  I am totally undemanding in this regard, so caveat emptor, however I have enjoyed free versions/clones of Bejeweled, Solitaire, Sudoku and Bubble Shoot.  All have played well and looked great.-- Viewing movies from Amazon Prime has been a treat.  The sound on my Bose headphones is excellent, the screen resolution/contrast/colors terrific.  I have a 15mbit/sec wifi (DSL) at home which is shared by the tablet, 3 computers (rarely running at the same time), and 3 roku boxes.  I've yet to experience buffering during a Prime movie.  I have once during a Netflix movie, but my internet provider has had problems now and then and I suspect them, not the HD or Netflix as the source of the problem.THE BAD-- I paid the extra $15 to avoid the advertisements.  When in Landscape mode, on the home screen, I don't get them.  If I turn to Portrait mode (some apps work in Portrait mode only), I get them anyway.  I'm rather disappointed about this, even though they are NOT all that annoying.  It's just that I feel I should have gotten what I paid for.  Be aware that a lot of free apps come with advertising as well.-- It is annoying that it does not work while charging.  I often lay in bed and surf or play or read on my 15.6\" laptop, with it plugged in.  I cannot do the same with the MUCH lighter Fire HD 8.9\".RECOMMENDATIONS:-- Got money?  Buy Apple.  But I have to say this Amazon Fire HD 8.9\" is an excellent choice for me.-- I did not buy the fast power adapter, but I am going to get one.  It is slow charging on a plug in USB phone charger or on my $10 Big Lots universal Home/Car USB charger.-- I don't get it.  People argue over hundreds of thousands of iApps, at least a hundred thousand Android Apps, and 10's of thousands of Amazon Apps.  Except for the specific apps I needed, and verified in advance would sideload to the Fire, I have found more than enough variety of apps for common uses.  I downloaded \"250+ Best Kindle Fire & Fire HD APPS For the New Kindle Fire Owner\" by Tom and Jenna Edwards.  Their advise and research proved valuable in finding good Apps early on.-- KNOW THYSELF.  Don't buy a tablet until you know why you want it, how you expect to use it, and what is REALLY important to you.  I read a hundred reviews of the 8.9\" before making the leap.  It was clear to me that the majority of nay sayers either thought the tablet would be a lightweight PC (capability wise), or were disappointed that yet another relatively inexpensive tablet failed to do everything the Apple product could exactly as well, and with as many software choices.  Give Amazon a break...they don't claim to be an iPad.  If that's what you want...work, save, beg, etc. until you can buy what you want.  But if you want do do basic things, this tablet has the capability, and is an excellent value for most people.One more thing.  When you go to Disneyland/Disneyworld, are you disappointed when you go into the Main Street stores and find a lot of MIckey Mouse ears, stuffed dolls, spoons, cups and other Disney fare?  NO...in fact, you buy some of it.  For crying out loud, don't get mad at Amazon, a for-profit business, for making it easy for you to buy STUFF from them on your Fire!  CONTROL YOURSELF.

Using Amazon prime to shop and watch videos is totally a pleasant experience. Using the micro hdmi cable plugged in your TV is an amazing feature to watch videos. Performance is OK, not the fastest tablet but for reading a book, watch movies and shop Amazon goods you don't really need a huge power house, and it is not expensive compared to other tablets. It has a vivid screen with excellent resolution ideal for reading books and magazines and watch photos and movies in full HD. I like the speakers a lot, they aren't very loud but sound quality is way superior to other tablets I have. So far this device has become my primary tablet, I use it every day to read the news, emails, books and browse the web instead of using my smartphone.The reason I'm giving 3 stars is because unfortunately the tablet is still plagued with bugs and crashes easily with the Silk browser. So far the bugs that I have caught are the following:+ The Silk browser delivers a very bad user experience. It crashes very often even if you just leave the tablet idle while reading a webpage, you will be asked many times to reload your tabs. In some cases, the whole tablet is unresponsive while using Silk, and it reboots after 2 or 3 minutes of being frozen. If you try to open more than two websites with the tabs, Silk slows down significantly and begins to shutdown your previously opened webpages (when you return to them it reloads everything again so you lose track of what where you doing) this is really bad if i.e. you are filling a form or making a payment (you need to enter all the information again), I would expect this behavior to happen when you open around 5 or 6 websites to prevent running out of memory perhaps, but not 3 tabs. You can side load Dolphin browser to mitigate these issues, however there is no excuse of why Silk performs so poorly.+ The keyboard input has a considerable lag, you can't write too fast since it will begin to miss key inputs, this forces you to write slowly (lag is less/more depending on the application you are using). Also something quite annoying I found is if I press the space key in the left/right edges while in landscape (just below, the 'x' and the 'b' keys respectively) it doesn't register any input even if you get the sound feedback you did press the key, to make it work you need to press around the center of the key.+ If I transfer 1080p videos from my smartphone they don't play properly. However 720p videos work fine.+ Sometimes the calendar app is shown as a gray empty rectangle in the carrousel instead of showing the correct date.+ It happened to me that while using the Shop application and the Silk browser sometimes I see black rectangles randomly in the screen (seems like a rendering issue from the graphics processor), most of the time going to the homescreen and returning to the app fixes the issue. In the case of Silk, reloading the webpage makes the trick.In summary, the tablet excels at watching movies, reading magazines, reading books, playing games and shopping amazon goods. Up to date it performs poorly as a web browser so if this is your priority task you may need to look for another tablet or wait until this is fixed by Amazon (I would rate 5 stars if the previous bugs where not present).Note: All the issues above have been reported already to Amazon, hopefully they create an update to fix them.", "Date": "January 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great purchase", "Author": "Nat", "ReviewID": "R2EPYHSU6PH8LY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I thought this would be daunting, book to read, all kinds of technical stuff, nothing.....you just need to sit with it, play with it and in a couple of hours you're moving around like a pro...very simple for someone who is technically challanged like me.

For the most part, things were pretty user friendly as the initial start-up of the units took us through a simple tutorial of the basic function.My only \"con\" to this product was the USB cable that was supplied with the unit which is the primary charging cord for the tablet. Neither unit would charge off the packaged USB cable. After 3 calls to Amazon Customer service I had come to the conclusion that if this was working as intended, I was going to re-package both units and send them back to Amazon for a full refund. If I couldn't charge the tablets with the supplied USB cables, there was no point in keeping them.As was always the case with Amazon, they were willing to supply us with the adapters that plugged into the walls at no cost to us. I am no expert but I have come to the conclusion the USB power stream is not enough to push power into the Kindle Fire 8.9\" battery.  You may convince me of that if it were not for the fact that I had two brand new units, both with the same charging problems. This may be something Amazon will wish to address in the near future.As long as the outlet adaptor and cable they are sending me work in charging this device, I will gladly recommend it's purchase to anyone.

Of course, this is just my opinion, and it really depends on what you use it for, but I will point out a few of the contrasts between the two in my opinion.  First, obviously since the 8.9 has a bigger screen, I found it more difficult to use for games, because the screen is larger and to swipe or slide your finger around the screen requires you to cover more real estate, so to speak, and therefore it's a bit more tedious.  I also found it to be less responsive than the 7\" version.  I found myself having to tap or slide sometimes more than once on the 8.9, which never happens on the 7.I understand the the screen resolution is higher on the 8.9, but quite honestly, I really can't tell the difference, even when watching high def movies or videos.  If there is a difference, to me it's not really noticeable.  One other downside is it really takes a long time to charge.  of course a bigger screen requires a bigger battery which explains the extended charge time, but for me, I am always on the go, so I don't always have 8 to 12 hours to wait for it to charge.  Also, the 7 fits in my pocket and I mostly can't even tell it's there most of the time.  The 8.9 is of course bigger and more cumbersome.So, my bottom line is that if you watch a lot of videos and a larger screen is a must, then go with the 8.9.  Otherwise, I prefer the 7 for everything else, including the price.  So for me, that's what I do with them.  Watch videos on the 8.9, and use the 7 on the go and for everything else.", "Date": "May 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "A Real Tablet", "Author": "W. T.

I used the 7\u201d just for reading and will do pretty much the same with the 8.9\u201d. The 8.9\u201d is much faster with a higher resolution screen, and in landscape orientation it allows for 2-column reading vs. a single column for the 7\u201d. Text rendering of the 8.9\u201d is very sharp. (For both tablets, I use white text on a black background to extend battery life.)2. Unlike the 7\u201d, the speed and screen size (almost 75% bigger viewing area) of the 8.9\u201d make web surfing a realistic possibility.3. While much bigger, the 8.9\u201d seems no harder to handle or use for reading than the 7\u201d, and it gives an overall higher sense of quality and good design.4. I never used the speakers on the 7\u201d; sound quality from the 8.9\u201d seems good enough.5. Advertising on the lock screen does not bother me\u2014I never look at it. But the 8.9\u201d seems to have many more hooks into the Amazon selling ecosystem. You may want to be more careful when you are clicking away that you don\u2019t accidentally buy something.6. I bought a protective case with the Fire HD 8.9\u201d but bought the wrong one; guess I assumed that the HD 8.9\u201d and the HDX 8.9\u201d are the same size. They are not; the HDX is apparently slightly smaller overall in both width and height. So for $9.99 I bought another case (CaseCrown Bold Trifold Case) that fits and well works in every way.7.

Beer.\"", "ReviewID": "RY0OKKORA6NRX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I received this as a holiday gift. The cool factor of having (another) tablet did not last more than a day for a few reasons. I love Android OS.The most frustrating feature of the Kindle is the on board web browser Silk. It is clumsy and does not offer advanced privacy options. This is my paramount desire. Alternating between the Amazon accelerated/encrypted browsing off and on, several of the websites I visit most are slow. I am looking at a very popular sport team's fan site, which was claimed to have been optimized for most modern browsers. The text forums take over a minute to load and scrolling is disjointed and clunky. Every time I exit silk, I must remember to delete all temporary files, settings, and passwords as I do not trust storing them, or the cookies and silk contains no setting to automatically browse \"in private\" (even though even with Firefox that is a misnomer, and other precautions should be taken).The Amazon app store is equally clumsy. Try searching for a specific item. I was looking for Final Fantasy games, and results ended up with items that obviously were not what I was searching for. There aren't enough controls or oversight on the content available, and it is hard to determine if the software (app) you are considering is what you actually desire. As much as I hate Apple, I do also have an IPad and, as much as I loathe DRM, Apple's presentation is much more polished. Both could stand slight updates in allowing additional advanced search options in regards to their respective digital store fronts. If I can't tell if the results from my search are a word document, a picture, a video, or a game then there is a very big problem.This introduces a criticism where these two issues merge: The app store does not currently offer any other reputable web browser options. Silk is terrrrrible, and Mozilla products are tagged as not currently available. After some quick internet searching, I figured out how to get on the beta releases for one of the more popular browser options that gives the end user more control. I have yet to be able to devote the time necessary to make it fully compatible with my needs; flash is not readily available and my web browsing is limited as a result. I still have to use Silk if I want to watch YouTube.What I actually want in a tablet is something that gives me control over my product, without challenging me to change it without voiding the warranty. I want to be able to change the wallpaper. I do not want to see an advertisement every time I pick it up; in all likelihood, I am probably not going to buy the junk you are trying to sell to me. I can't stand the carousel. Every time I finish with something I remove it from the home screen. If someone truly enjoys that type of file management assistance, they should go with an MS product. The constant monitoring Amazon does on the device limits the performance of the hardware, and robs resources that would otherwise enhance performance. Pass on this. I think the only way I will get what I want is if I build it myself, or root something with the hardware I need.Edit: I forgot to mention charging, which took 10 hours to go from 3% to 100%.

I am a prime member and it is pretty sweet for my needs. 95% entertainment and just a smidge of other stuff.  So far all the games and apps I want I have been able to get and all of them were free.  I use Flixter for my UV copies of movies I own so I can watch them while offline if I download them. Granted they are standard def, but they still help to pass the time when I am not on a wireless or want to play a game.  I have streamed The Avengers from Prime and it looked fantastic, not buffering no \"in/out\" of HD.  The dual antenna did it's job. The screen is fantastic compared to my wife's Kindle Fire 7\" 1st Gen.  The speakers sound really good too. So for movies it is a fantastic device.  Silk is ok but I just go to google, using Silk and surf using Google and it works great.  It is a little heavy but, that honestly does not bother me, I kinda like the weight as it seems, in my head at least, like the lighter devices feel \"cheaper\" even though reality , tells me they are not.Now I agree a charger should have been included but it wasn't. So instead of paying the $20 for the \"official\" Kindle wall charger I did more digging and found a great one with fantastic reviews that is super fast. The RAVPower\u00ae RP-UC05 Dual USB Travel Wall Charger, it does the trick and has some built-in device protection, and is half the cost.  When I charge the Kindle I turn off the wireless so it charges faster, and it fully charges in @1 hr. (The lowest I have gotten the battery life before charging it is 15%).  For me the battery life is fine.  I think it is like my Galaxy media player where if I turn off the wireless, the battery lasts a lot longer.  So far I have done so and the Kindle last a lot longer.  So if you are not using the wireless, turn it off, because it will continually scan for networks and will make the Kindle work harder and thus drain the battery quicker.  Also dial back the brightness, mine is at about 75% and still plenty bright.  But both these suggestions should be common knowledge these days as far as prolonging charges.The part that confuses me, is a lot of the reviews.  It is as if the majority of negative reviewers did not spend one second reading other reviews or the product description and just made a blind buy.  First thing I noticed while reading other reviews esp the very first \"Most Helpful Review\" (Which is great) and the comments for that specific review, is that is said it does not come with a wall charger.  So I knew what to expect.  But for the people who were suprised about this...do you not read reviews????  If you also would have looked at \"what is included in the box\" you will not see a charger, again, do you research people.  There were reviews complaining about being surprised about lack of Flash Player...again, READ REVIEWS.  There are reviews that will state that it is not supported (not a kindle issue, it is Adobe that has made that decision).  So how can you be surprised?  There were some that gave it 1 star because the screen cracked when they dropped it.  Umm, how is that the devices fault that you cannot hang onto it?  Just dumb.  I don't get why for an expensive purchase like this, people seem to not do any research and then give negative reviews because they are \"unaware\" or \"surprised\" about a certain aspect of the device.  Or blame the device for not having something that is just not possible either due to the ecosystem or the particular programs' origin.  Duh, DO YOUR RESEARCH TO MAKE AN EDUCATED AND FAIR JUDGEMENT AND DECISION.Again, this is my first tablet.  AFTER DOING A BUNCH OF RESEARCH, I feel this matches my needs.  I could not justify spending almost twice as much for an Apple product.  I am glad I went with the bigger 8.9\" HD vs the equally priced 7\" HDX.  The faster processor interested me with the HDX but the bigger screen made more sense for what I wanted.  For reference, the 8.9\" screen itself is as big as the entire 7\" device.  My best suggestion, is go to Best Buy if you can, and give them a test drive.  Just cuz this is the \"older\" OS and \"slower\" processor does NOT necessarily make this the \"red headed step child\" of tablets.  Let's face it just 365 days ago this was THE Kindle to get.  I am glad I got the device I did, but it is ALL personal taste.  Do your research to find what will fit YOUR needs the best as every device will have its positives and it's drawbacks.

Super price, I found mine on sale at a brick and mortar store. This has the options you need in a tablet today. It's funny with cars, people choose what they buy for a price, not every product needs every option and this has all you want. To get this beauty with an easy to use operating system and beast of tech hardware for such a low price is Genius.Key Elements I reviewed compared to other tablets:  Amazon's modified Android works elegantly. The experience feels a bit magical as you glide through flowing crisp carousels of your web sites, app's, books and movies important to you. Whatever Amazon did, it makes Android better than buying true Android, no worries. Compare to true Android and you will likely run to the Kindle Fire. Buy or try a Nexus product (for a full day to really see) as that's the closest thing to true Android. Ok, so programmer or 'hackers' as they call themselves love stock Android but it's less intuitive, harder to get things done for the rest of us. Even HTC and Samsung give you modified Android to make it a bit easier. Kindle like Apple IOS attempts to simplify how you find and work with your content and the device itself. So they bring tasks or actions to you to get done, less time figuring out how.  User be warned, that does not mean there's no learning curve, there is!  Like all tech, you need to still learn briefly how to find your way around but it's less than typical Android that's for sure and I suspect in some ways easier than apple simply because it's meant to be used to enjoy your content.  Size and weight of a new tablet are fine. This was my big hang up holding me back from picking any new tablet in general... I am glad I went bigger this time. My previous tablet (HTC Flyer) was a 7 inch and I found it more than acceptable for one 2 1/2 years old and still a joy to use when rarely I want something small. The extra 2 inches of this larger Fire screen keeps me engaged longer when I read or surf the web. The weight by the way is no problem either as it's no heavier than an Apple of similar size and since the tablet is larger, your handling of the extra ounces is distributed naturally in your hand, lap or chest so I find it just fine.  Back Facing Camera, you have a smart phone! For many of us we don't care if it does not have a back facing camera. Hauling around a tablet for filming movies or pictures? Been there-did that. I do it with a smaller smart phone these days.  You pay for options. Do you need options you wont use?  Lack of choice in using other's app store and web browser? Come on, this is Amazon... I was using their app store as much as Google play before this so it's not a big deal only using the largest online retailer in the world's app store.  the Kindle fire browser is very sweet - I would ignore tech site reviews complaining about not having a choice (because they want Firefox or something) this Silk browser I now use is as nice as any and better than most and I wont waste your time comparing.

It's smooth, it's durable, and the HD is great. I can play videos no problem, the sound is AMAZING, and I'm able to do almost everything I want with it.Some of the things that the Kindle are unable to do is the availability of the apps. There are many apps that are available on other tablets but cannot be accessed by the Kindle, which makes it sort of behind in the tablet world. Another is the lack of a good camera. The front-facing camera is nice, but I think a rear-facing camera would also be extremely useful and make the tablet much more appealing. The app built into the Kindle itself to take pictures is also VERY basic, showing only the digital viewing screen and the button to take the picture: no settings, no zoom, nothing. If you want to do anything more than simply take pictures with the camera, you have to download a camera app, which most cost money.The web browser built in to the Kindle is also nice, but I'm disappointed in the lack of other browsers available to download, such as Chrome. However, Silk is a fast, easy to maneuver browser, and it's suitable enough for the browsing that I do on the tablet.The things that I do like are the sound, which far exceeded my expectations of what I thought it would be. It's crisp, clear, and even with a cover on it it still feels like a small surround sound system. I also like the many features that come with the Kindle such as the cloud storage, the easy access to amazon itself, and having everything all on one screen, unlike the iPad and other tablets. The e-reader aspect of it is also very nice, I love how it records my reading speed and tells me how much longer I have in the current chapter or in the book itself. The options for the page viewing is also nice and I would definitely keep using my Kindle even if it was able to do just this.In all, I am very pleased with the Kindle and what it has done for me in the two months that I have had it so far, but it could come much farther as a tablet.

No more limited Cable TV with no guide and 1 movie channel. This was a Brain saver when you have to stay around the room for evenings. The Kindle Fire HD 7\" would be a great unit for kids instead of the mini game consoles. There are thousands of games for free, the have access to the Web, they can Skype call you all for less than $200. I have the larger 8.9\" , its antenna system was tested by CNET to be better than that on IPADs. I tried it everywhere there was a Free WiFi connections.

I am really enjoying it so far so I'll start of by describing what I like and dislike about it.PROS:The Screen on the Kindle Fire HD is beautiful. It's great to watch movies and play games on (which is what I mostly use it for)There are several apps to watch movies/television including Netflix, Amazon Instant Video, HBO GO and ShowtimeThis Kindle Fire costed $300, which is by no means cheap, but it is cheaper than the iPad Mini and is bigger and better than the iPad mini.Sound on this tablet is great. It has great sound quality and is pretty loud. Great for watching movies or televisionYou can sideload apps pretty easily on here, so you are not limited to the Amazon App Store (you can download 1Mobil and get free apps and games)It's really easy to read on and it's really easy to highlight or add notes.Cons:Unlike other tablets, it doesn't have a back camera.It comes with ads. I opted out of the ads for $15, but you can't change the wallpaper and are stuck with the wallpapers Amazon has chosen (which are by no means ugly)The silk browser isn't very good. However, you can sideload other browsers like Dolphin or Chrome using 1Mobil or other meansThe App store isn't very large, and updates can take longer than Apple and AndroidThere are no Google apps. It doesn't have Gmail, Youtube, Maps or others, but you can sideload these with limited functionality (you can't sign in to youtube)Many apps are not HD optimized.There is little customization, but it makes it very simple to use.It doesn't let you remove tabs from the top if you don't want them.Overall:This is a great tablet. If you are looking for a good, affordable tablet, get this one. Don't let the limited apps stop you from buying this tablet, because it is really easy to siideload apps.", "Date": "August 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire HD!", "Author": "Penny Olson", "ReviewID": "R1XYYZQCJF6ZFS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love my new Kindle Fire HD!

My Laptop, Desktop computer and smartphone are all apple products, so the only product \"line\" that I have which is not an Apple device is the tablet section. I went with the KFHD instead of the iPad, and I'm glad I did.Let me first says that I'm typing this with my Kindle Fire HD (through a bluetooth physical keyboard though)I have recomended the Kindle Fire HD (both the 7\" and the 8.9\") to over 15 people and all of them have bought it. PS. I feel like a sales represetative lol. I prefer the size of the 8.9\" over the size of the full sized ipad because I like the fact that this is a litte bit smaller, it gives the fire a great feeling of portability. As for the 7\", I like that better than the ipad mini because again, I like the feeling of portability whith that respective size class. the screen is very clear and really gives a popping out display that the ipad lacks, evenwith the retina display.Another thing that I found was the even though both the Kindle Fire HD and the ipad offer cloud storage, I find the cloud storage on the Kindle, and Amazon as a whole to be more user friendly, and much easier to acess. The speakers are great, the battery life is also great, and about the same as the ipad is you compare miliamp size to power usage. The user interface is much different than anything that I have ever seen but I find it to be reallyl great.I personally use this tablet for education. I use the Kindle for taking notes, writing papers sometimes (however I usually use my laptop for that). It really helps that I have a physical bluetooth keyboard because it really increases my typing ability and productivity. I sync my notes between my computer and my Kindle so I always have them. The built in documents is really handy especially on the go because it syncs very quickly.As the app store is not the google play store, I find thatnot to be a problem at all because sideloading apps is an option, plus the Amazon store still has a very goodselection of apps, especially for what I use it for. There is a whole section of education and productivity apps.Most people use this tablet for media such as Hulu, Amazon Instant Video, and Netflix. Along with social like Facebook and Skype as those all run and look great of this very clear screen.

Thank you.", "Date": "May 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire vs what?", "Author": "JesusIsLord", "ReviewID": "R11GA8FYRK8FGK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So after a lengthy and tedious research between the Kindle Fire HD and the Ipad Mini, I chose to purchase the Kindle Fire...and what a great choice I made. My reason for searching for a tablet was because I have the original Kindle Fire and simply wanted something bigger, faster, and with a little more activity and more space. Realize the things I primarily use my Kindle for is Music, Reading, Games, Web and Notetaking. This is a pure entertainment device for me. I don't do my banking, pay bills, etc. as I still have a desktop computer that I use primarily. I can honestly say that I have read most of the reviews on this product so I will try and hit most of the things that people seem most interested in and what I found to be helpful in my decision to purchase the Kindle Fire.FIRSTI bought my Kindle Fire from Best Buy (along with the royal purple standing leather case) and everything was all good. It comes with a front and back quick guide to get you started as well as a USB cord for you to transfer data from your computer to your device. Unfortunately, there was no charger but I have found that my Duo USB/car charger that I use for my smartphone works just fine and it charges rather quickly.SETUP/REGISTRATIONThis was pretty easy to do, especially since I already own a Kindle Fire. I only had to enter a few pieces of information and it recognized me from my first Kindle. It automatically transferred my content from my old Kindle to this one. All I had to do was go into my Amazon Cloud and redownload it. I had quit a bit of stuff to redownload and it took all of about 10 minutes to do so. I was a little concerned about the whole setup at first because I went thru loops with my first Kindle but this one was a breeze.POWER/VOLUME BUTTONSI was content with the location and operation of these buttons. I notice in other reviews people have a difficult time with them, but I have no problem at all.DISPLAYThis has got to be the best screen resolution on the market. Remember, I said I did a lot of research between this and the ipad mini and while the mini is nice too, this is just crystal clear. It's smooth and I have no complaints about it at all. I noticed people were having problems with the glare or lack or retina display but I adjusted the \"Brightness\" option (which I only had to do once when I was reading outside) and that worked for me.SOUNDGreat sound! You can hear this thing miles and miles away. Very crisp and not muffled at all. I use this to play my music from vs a cd player when I am at home, church, work etc. Very satisfied.APPSSo the biggest thing people seem to complain about is the lack of apps that Amazon provides. Sure, the ipad mini has nearly a million apps to choose from but I'm not gonna use nearly a million apps. I find the apps on Amazon to be sufficient.READINGThe reading on the Kindle Fire HD has definitely improved. Just reading it on a bigger screen makes all the difference to me. Plus, there are more options for you to customize it to your liking.WIFII have no wifi connection at my home so when I want to use the internet or make purchases from the Amazon Store or even listen to music I've purchased from my Amazon mp3 app, I have to go to a hotspot. This doesn't necessarily bother me as I still have a desktop computer at home that I use primarily.MOVIESI guess I'm the only person in the world still using a dvd player, but I do not watch movies on my Kindle Fire so I can not give an accurate review on movies.WEBWhen I do use the internet, I use it for CNN, youtube, Google and downloading more apps.ADSAnother thing that has people degrading this device is the ads. Folks, it is NOT that serious. When your Kindle is in sleep mode and you press the Power button to unlock the screen, an ad will display in the lock screen. It gives you the option to accept the offer or unlock your screen. When you unlock your screen (slide bar from right to left), the ad goes away and you can begin to use your Kindle as you please. It's no different from the ads you see on your cell phone when you're playing games or when you're watching a video and an ad pops up before it plays. Save your $15.OVERALLSo overall, I feel this is a great device to invest in. I realize that people buy tablets as their primary use of a computer but that's not the case for me. Honestly, there's a lot of stuff I use my phone for before I use my desktop at home, which is why I didn't purchase the WIFI with cellular service because I feel I am already paying for internet on my smartphone which is always with me so why pay double? Just my opinion on that. Still, I have not put my Kindle Fire down since I bought it. So if you are battling between the Kindle Fire HD and the Ipad/Ipad Mini, I recommend the Kindle Fire by far. I'm already partial to Amazon because I make frequent purchases off Amazon and ultimately, wanted to stay with the Kindle family. I think most people go for the Ipad because of the name but the Kindle Fire HD serves the purpose for my satisfaction. It's simple, get the Kindle!!!", "Date": "May 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire Hd 8.9 is my constant companion", "Author": "Joan Shulman \"Owlnut\"", "ReviewID": "R2V7M14SDOEG8R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Other than having just the books to read, the apps for games and such, a delightful camera that takes fair pictures, and magnificent storage for all my books, music, apps, etc, etc, etc., this Kindle Fire is  a marked improvement over my last one.

I did a lot of research before making this decision.First, I ruled out Apple because I don't like Apple so my research did not include them other than a comparison of the Kindle Fire to the iPad 7.My only previous experience with a tablet has been my HP Touchpad, which I got in the fire sale. I loaded Android ICS on it and for the most part it worked fine.  My wife had one as well but both started getting buggy and I wanted a `real' device.After doing a lot of reading on forums and tech sites about `the best Android tablet' I narrowed the choice to two: the Kindle 8.9 and the Asus TF300. Both fell into my price range and got good reviews.What the TF300 had going for it was being a 10\" tablet running Android. What it had going against it was a proprietary charging system (not mini usb) and some reports of bugginess. The charging thing ultimately killed it in my mind. I have tons of mini usb chargers in my house so I can plug in practically anywhere. And when I travel, I only need one charger for my tablet and phone.So I took a leap of faith and went with the Kindle 8.9. My impressions over the last couple of weeks:The screen is smaller than a 10\" tablet, but it plays Netflix and Hulu at the size as my Touchpad does because there is less letter-boxing top/bottom, so that isn't a problem. It did take me a week or so to get used to a smaller screen when visiting websites though.The first day I had my Kindle, Silk (Kindle's web browser) crashed every.single.time I tried to use it. I rebooted and I've only had one crash in the last two weeks. My wife also has a Kindle 8.9 and has never reported a Silk crash happening to her. Others have noted this problem so hopefully a patch will coming along at some point.Amazon did their own thing and layered over Android. The App store isn't as large as Android and many of the apps I had free on Android cost on Kindle because the vendor only offers the pay version. Not a deal breaker given the general cost of apps and you can side load apps if you really want to. \"I Love My Kindle (fire)\" is a good blog about the fun things that can be done with a Kindle Fire.It is smaller and lighter than my Touchpad. The screen is amazing and it has good sound overall. It's a very responsive device; opening apps quickly. I've had no problems with any apps.Battery life is amazing. I find myself forgetting when I charged it last, even after streaming movies.You have to buy an outlet charger separate. It's $19.99 but sometimes you can get it for $9.99. I assume not including one was a way to keep costs down but seems silly.I bought one without ads. My wife has the ads and doesn't mind them but it kind of annoyed me. Costs $15 so it may or may not be worth it to you.Since we have a Prime account, the integration with Amazon is really nice. I can easily access all my books and videos from the top menu bar. No more logging into Amazon to get to my videos and I don't have to open the kindle app to get to my books. These are all a swipe away.The Kindle has its own desktop, using a carousel and bookshelf. The thing I don't like about this is everything gets ordered by last use, making locating things a bit of a challenge because they are never in the same place. But there is a \"favorites\" where you can put stuff so this isn't a big deal.  And if you really hate it, you can side load a program that gives you the Android option of multiple screens. I initially hated the carousel and bookshelf but have gotten used to them.", "Date": "March 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for most needs", "Author": "S.

Got it on sale (same price it's selling for now apparently) plus used some Amazon points so it wasn't that much more than the 7.  Bigger screen than the 7\" tablets or the mini makes web use and movie watching a lot nicer.

It's an excellent tablet for all those things.  I looked at the iPad mini, Nexus 7, and Kindle Fire HD 7 and 8.9 and chose the Fire 8.9.  Got it on sale (same price it's selling for now apparently) plus used some Amazon points so it wasn't that much more than the 7.  Bigger screen than the 7\" tablets or the mini makes web use and movie watching a lot nicer.  Understand that any technology like this is going to be obsolete in three to five years, so there was no reason to spend more money for stuff I wouldn't use.  Plus it's not so expensive that I don't mind the kids using it now and then.The display is awesome.  Better than an iPad mini (which doesn't have a Retina display when I compared them).  Speakers are very good for a tablet.  The Silk browser works fine...I haven't had problems with it.

I figured I should post a review on it, so here it is. I'll break it down by sections, as the Amazon page has the different features broken down:Display:They weren't kidding, this screen has to be seen to be believed. I haven't compared it to the latest gen iPad, but it's really gorgeous. I've played back Wreck It Ralph in full HD on it and wow, it just pops. Singularly the best screen I've seen, and I've seen many. :)Regarding reduced screen glare, I guess I can see where other displays could have caused glare where this one didn't, but it's such a non-issue in day-to-day use that I just really can't comment much on it. I would have to do further specific testing to see if this is the case with a similar screen to see if there is indeed a difference.Sound:Although it's not \"booming sound\", it certainly beats the pants off of any other tablet I've used in terms of loudness and quality. I have an iPad 2 and a Nook Tablet, and both frustrated me with how low their sound output was. Not a problem with the Fire HD. I personally haven't really heard any virtual surround sound effects as yet (Waiting to get the money to buy something that'll actually use it, like say the Band of Brothers series in full HD), so that's also a non-issue for me now. Will update when I get a chance to test that specific function.Dual-Band Wifi:I have a MIMO router, and I've attempted to use it to transfer large files over (In my test case scenario, downloading the full HD version of Wreck It Ralph to my Fire HD). It's seamless, but I wouldn't say it's 43% faster than the new iPad or 65% faster than the Nexus 7. I don't have a specific rating, but to me it just felt about 20% faster than using straight up 802.11g. Still, it's a nice bonus.Processor Speed:No complaints with the OMAP4470, it does just about everything I've thrown at it with aplomb. The SGX544 graphics core was able to handle the most graphically intensive game I could get (A Bard's Tale) with zero problems. The only thing that was perplexing was that I was unable to get MKV files converted to MP4 format to play, but I'm rather suspecting that it's a converter issue, so I'm not holding that against the Fire HD. I'll try again later with other MP4 files that I know are good and report back.Storage:I got the 16GB version, of which 12.8 is user available. If you can swing it, I highly suggest the 32GB version. When I downloaded an HD movie (About 8GB), along with two other SD TV episodes (40 mins each) and a few hundred MP3's, I was getting some serious space issues. I really, really, REALLY wished the Fire HD had a microSD slot, and I'm going to knock a star off for just that. It's really annoying having to constantly shuffle content around just because of space issues. I'm actually considering gifting this one to my wife and moving to the 32GB version just because of that, but that extra expense wouldn't have been needed if they just put in a microSD card slot. :(Amazon Prime:Pretty freaking awesome. However, that's not germane (much) to the review of the device itself (Barring the ability to borrow books from the Amazon Lending Library and Prime Instant Video), so suffice to say that you should consider getting Prime if you buy a Fire HD.Apps:Getting better day by day, and the Free App of the Day is actually pretty neat, but still lags behind what's in the Google Play market. However, they got most of the popular apps available, so that's a plus. Still as yet have to see any real Fire exclusive apps, but I'm not holding my breath on that as yet. Quick note (And again, not related specifically to the device), the Facebook app (As of 3/19/13) still is pretty buggy. Just a head's up.Content Availability:This is Amazon we're talking about. They have quite a bit of content available, and growing day by day. So you're covered on that front. :)Book Reading:My first and foremost use of my Fire HD is an eReader. In actuality I almost got the Paperwhite because that's what I really wanted. However, since I had lost my Nook Tablet I was without a media consumption device (My Vita doesn't count), I decided that the Fire HD would do it for me. Reading on an LCD screen doesn't bother me (Although I know for some they get eye fatigue), so I figured it would be okay for that purpose. Indeed, it is. Although this might sound like a minor thing, but I really like the default background color they use when you're reading a book. It makes the letters stand out like a real book would, and reduces eye strain. However, if that's not your cup of tea you can change it. The fonts and sizes of said fonts are also changable if you so wish to do so (I found the defaults to work fine). All the usual e-reader things are available (Thesaurus if you double-tap a word, highlighting passages of interesting, sharing passages on your social networks, etc..), and it takes DRM-free e-books just fine (I had purchased a Tom Clancy novel from another vendor, an e-pub file, and it worked fine once I copied it over to the Fire HD). In addition, to those folks who need bigger print to read, I can see this device be very handy for them.The only downside to this device as an e-ready is very simple... Weight.While laying down in bed and holding it with one hand aloft reading it will tire out your hand/arm quickly enough. While not a MAJOR problem, you need to be aware of it. If you want something light enough for that to not be an issue, I would suggest looking hard at the Paperwhite. In fact, I'm STILL considering a Paperwhite for just this reason, as I tend to read a LOT in bed.Side note: I attempted to test out the Text to Speech option. It's okay in a pinch, but the synthetic voice would drive me a bit insane after a while. :) THAT being said, I have NOT tried the \"Professional Reading\" option that you have on certain books. I'm sure that would make a BIG difference! I'll report back when I test that out. Note: This option is a bit of an extra charge.Magazine Reading:I decided to put this in it's own category because I thought that it was important enough of a distinction from book reading. On the whole magazines look very crisp and sharp (Actually, comparing my in-print copy of Maxim to the digital version I think the digital version is sharper on the HD!), and for some magazines (For example, the latest issue of the SI Swimsuit Edition) they add tons of additional content that you can't get with print, such as video clip add-ons and the like (The coolest was a live Twitter feed of the SI models, creative!). You can zoom in to see details or just go page by page, as you prefer. Very nicely done!Music/MP3's:I've been transitioning away from iTunes for some time now, so I've got a decent selection from Amazon's MP3 store. It was seamless to transfer the songs over, using the same app that's on my phone. So no worries there.Audiobooks:I was unaware that Amazon had purchased Audible, and I had several audiobooks with them already. Transferring them over was cake, and worked just fine. Good stuff there.X-Ray:A cool feature, but not one that I've used at all. I just haven't really seen a need to. Still, it's cool.Skype:Works like a champ, but then again I'm not expecting anything different.Kindle Free Time:Although I have kids, they have their own (low cost) tablets, so there is no need for them to share mine. Thus it wasn't tested. However, I can see that this would be great for families that are sharing the Fire.Browser:Drives me a bit batty, but that's just me. I eventually am going to try and side load Chrome on this, but the default browser drives me a bit nuts. That being said, at least YouTube works in it (Especially critical because there is no native YouTube app!). Generally I try to avoid the browser whenever I can. Again, for most folks I guess it would be fine, but I'm a bit of a browser snob. ;)Photos:I LOVED the fact that it would automatically download all of my Facebook pictures into my Fire. Other than that, it's a standard photo app, nothing to write home about. =)Shopping:Obviously the Fire HD is a great window into all the wares that Amazon has to offer. It's way, way, way too easy to do so. =DWell, that's about it. I hope that I was some help to some that are thinking about the device. I'm giving it a four out of five stars, with losing a star because of the lack of expandable storage and because of the weight (.90 of a star for the former, .10 for the latter, if you want to know my breakdown). So yes, a SOLID device. :)", "Date": "March 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "SO FAR, GREAT!", "Author": "DAG", "ReviewID": "R2L3ND8T00GDEV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this tablet after purchasing and iPAD mini for my son for Christmas, the iPAD work flawlessly as much as I was able to determine for the short time I was able to use it.  After reading the reviews on the Kindle Fire HD 4g LTE wireless WIFI unit I found that it had 'better' video quality, also sound quality (as per advertisement) but in reality the sound requires a 'booster' for the 'hard of hearing' (which I am) but on the positive side I 'LIKE IT' it is able to get aps that I personally like, Netflix, Hulu Plus, Crackle, games and accessing my home PC, etc., etc. I haven't really gotten into the other aps just due to 'time to explore' but what it has which is the ICING on the cake as it were is the 4G LTE wireless access which allows me to access aps and computer from almost anywhere (so far), so I gave it a FOUR STAR rating for doing what it is doing so far and I must admit that it is pushing a FIVE STAR rating if it continues to 'work' as it has been doing, I'm sure it will get BETTER as time goes on, let's hope, eh?Now for the AT&T; services required for the 4g LTE mode, I will just keep a tight lip on this for now, I not thrilled so far and when I purchased this 'item' I was sure it stated that the dollar amount was $49.99 A YEAR, which isn't true, perhaps I read it wrong, so now I just renewed the service for 250mgs for 30 days @ $14.99 per month which I was not made aware of when I purchased the KINDLE FIRE HD 4G LTE WIRELESS WIFI 8.9\" SCREEN, ETC, ETC.  but I still LIKE IT, even though....???", "Date": "March 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Happy!", "Author": "D.

They were asking for a lot of money for a product that I could tell the Kindle Fire HD tablet could compete with.  I primarily made the purchase because of college.

The picture is extremely good, especially on the two HD movies I bought to test - \"The Town\" and \"The 'A' Team.\" If, when contemplating your purchase, you are contemplating skipping out on the HD videos because the quality won't be a big difference (I do that with DVDs compared to Blu-Ray because my eye can't necessarily tell the difference even on a 47\" screen), you should reconsider. On the SD videos I bought or already had - \"Toy Story 3\" and the 2 seasons of \"Dark Blue,\" the quality of the video was not nearly as good. So, if you are planning on sticking with HD videos, this device will be a good buy for you. With HD source videos, the picture is nice and clear. You do get some glare, but it's about the same as with other devices. The HDMI out works fine, I bought an HDMI A-to-D cable and hooked it up to my TV, no big deal.Now... The sound. Devices claiming to have superior sound are a dime a dozen. This one gets the prize, though - it has the best sound by far of any other tablet, phone, or laptop I have owned (note, I have never owned an iDevice of any sort so I can't speak to that). The \"Dolby Surround\" is truly great, especially at higher volumes and while watching things such as action movie trailers that are packed with explosions and deep bass. Sound is also decent through bluetooth - I have a Bluetooth speaker and a pair of headphones, and they both perform about as well with the Fire as with as with my other devices.I hate to say it, but the hype about the wi-fi on this device is mostly that, hype - at least for those of us with regular-speed Internet (DSL/cable) and N-routers. I haven't tried it with a dual band router and FiOS or something equivalent, maybe it would outperform its competition on something like that, I don't know.The Facebook app for the Kindle is terrible - this is not Amazon's fault, but Facebook's - I feel this is worth noting, since a lot of people would want to use it. The last I checked, Facebook is claiming that they are working on a fix, but I won't hold my breath. Also worth noting that the Fire HD is not flash compatible, meaning that you will not be able to watch a lot of online videos out of the box - again, not Amazon's fault, but Adobe's, as far as I know, Adobe is not providing support for Flash on any new mobile devices.Again, I have not compared this device against an iPad 3 - but at this price point, if you just want a device to browse the Net and watch some videos, this is a great choice.", "Date": "February 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire HD 8.9", "Author": "Gail Joramo", "ReviewID": "R1NR7BUXKTGSC7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have to make you aware that I had my son and many of my friends help me research which type of e-reader I should buy and I was torn between the IPad and the Kindle Fire so when the 8.9 made its way onto the scene and I saw the reviews...I was sold.

The free time is awesome.  Our kids love using it and it gives me peace of mind knowing they can't purchase anything, change any settings, or access the web.  The web browser needs to be improved but it's still a very good browser that does everything I need.Overall an excellent product.

The new Kindle Fire competes with many of the new tablet devices on the market today.  I had my parents purchase the Fire for me, and then they shipped to me.  I live in Shanghai.  The package was held by customs, and I was required to pay an import tax of 10%  of the total value (30USD=195RMB).  It was worth it.PROS:The numerous forums and discussion post that can be found about the Kindle make using it a breeze.  AS others have stated, using the kindle as is does have its limitations (movies must be converted to MP4 in order to be played on the Kindle My Video Player) but a minor problem quickly solved with the download of a free third party app, EZ File Explorer.  With this you can add multiple third party apps that run on the Android iOS.Excellent video quality.  When buying a video through Amazon you are given a choice of quality to download.  Lower quality = quicker download time.Speakers.  Fantastic sound quality from the new Fire.  I ran FUN Some Nights at full volume against my friends iPad 2.  Sound was clear, with no distortion, and noticeably louder than the iPad.Prime Members have access to a vast selection of Movies and TV Shows to stream, and access to an extensive lender library for eBooks.Office Suite Professional 6.  Upon starting my Kindle Fire for the first time, and after initial setup I began exploring and working things out for myself.  I opened the Office Suite 6 app for the first time and was asked if I wished to upgrade to professional.  It was free.  I now have the ability to Open, Edit, Save, and Create Word Documents, Excel Spreadsheets, and PowerPoint presentations.  A wonderful application that helps the Kindle compete with many of the other tablets on the market today.Screen Resolution.  Having subscribed to my favorite magazines I was stunned by the excellent picture quality.  While reading with the Kindle held in portrait mode results in a block of empty black space at the bottom, it does not interrupt reading.  Works well in landscape mode as well.Reading.  While reading, you can change between a white background with black letters, a black background with white letters, or the sepia background with black letters.  While personally have not, do think I will be reading white letters on a black background, the options are nice help to meet a variety of preferences.Keyboard.  The touch keyboard is quick to respond and easy to navigate.  Letters, Numbers, and Symbols are well organized and easy to find and use.  While typing very quickly can result in a brief lag time, it is the same lag I experience with my iPhone 4.Cloud Storage.  The inclusion of Cloud Storage is a great addition to the Kindle, and greatly increases your storage space.  There is plenty of space for a nice collection of movies, music, and books for any Kindle Holder.Bluetooth Capabilities.  I purchased a Bluetooth keyboard to use with the Kindle as well.  It is a wonderful addition turning my kindle into a portable net book.  It beats having to carry 17\" HP Laptop to the office every morning that is for sure.Ads.  Not as bothersome as I thought they would be.  The lock screen will feature and ad.  Slide to the right to learn more, slide to the left to unlock.  If it is not an ad, it is just a random picture of a book or colorscape.  Not at all bothersome, and I would not spend $15 to rid the Fire of Ads and instead use that $15 to purchase an Italo Calvino novel from the Kindle Store.CONS:No VPN.  One con, which others may not find as bothersome as I do, is that currently there is no working VPN for the Kindle Fire that I know of.  I currently run Astril on my home computer, but they have yet to release an app for the current version of the Android iOS the Fire runs.  The only working VPN is one that requires Cisco systems corporate servers.  A VPN should not be a make or break point for those considering the Fire.  I live in Shanghai, and the Great Firewall of China is bothersome, blocking not only Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and other social media sites, but also randomly blocking sites for unknown reasons; marthastewart.com, punchfork.com.  I do hope that either Amazon or a third party can get a working VPN out soon.No wall charger.  Out of the box you will get your Kindle and the new black mini USB cable.  The fast charger is available, for $19.99.  This is slightly bothersome as I need to keep my Fire plugged into my computer to charge.  Also, I am warned that my Fire may not charge while in use.OVERALL:All in all, I am loving my new Fire.  In less than a week of use I am pleased with the new Fire and see.

If you are into lots of games and are an apps freak then, I have to be fair the IPad and the Google devices are better. so it all comes down to what you want your tablet to do.

I also own an original fire that I got last year for myself. I have mixed feelings on the new HD fire tablets. First I'll briefly go over how I use my kindle, then the good and the bad stuff. So far I think it's definitely a step up from the previous generation and worth the purchase though. I do have a few gripes.I use my fire to do quick internet checks as it starts up much faster than a computer. I have a few eBooks and a LOT of audio books. Since our family has Amazon Prime and Netflix accounts I can also watch video on it when convenient. Finally, I surprisingly enjoy gaming on the tablet. I have a few gaming systems and with excellent games like Rayman Jungle Run, Cut the Rope, and Stupid Zombies 2,to name a few, I probably play games on the kindle more than on my PSP.So whats better? The new Kindles have an app called Free Time which finally gives parental control options for the device. And you can opt into the Free Time Unlimited service which is basically like Netflix for children's programming. This includes apps, videos and over 1,000 books. It's good but not perfect. I can micro-manage and designate how much time the kids can spend playing games versus reading for example. Or I can simply give them 2hrs per day and they can do what ever they choose. But I can't give them a different time allowance for weekends which is not cool. I'd like to, for example, have the option to maybe give them 2 hrs on school days and 5hrs on the weekends. Another shortcoming is that there is no way that a kid can log out of their account without a parent entering the password. This probably isn't an issue if the kid is the sole user of the tablet but I have 2 kids sharing so when they need to switch I have to log them out every time. It would have made more sense to let them log out to the profile selection screen and require a password only if backing out of that space. This wouldn't work for 5 year olds but at least allow this option for older kids who can have passwords. On the positive side, the parental feature disables ads and in-game purchasing in the child accounts. Unfortunately you still can't have more than 1 adult account though.Another new feature than I really enjoy is the immersive reading. If I have the eBook and audio book for select titles I can sync them. So I can look at the eBook text which highlights words in real time as the audio book plays. Or I can listen to my book during my commute and then read the ebook at home and the ebook will sync up to where the audio book left off. Thats very cool. The speaker sound is also much improved.The new models also have more storage. The screen also looks really good though I admit it doesn't really make that much of a difference for streaming video. It also had an HDMI port, but it's micro HDMI so you'll have to get the cable as it's unlikely you own one. On the up side it now has physical volume buttons. The virtual volume controls still exist. On the down side, the new models don't come with chargers included anymore and it seems to take much longer to charge than before. They can be purchased though.  Thats about all I can say. It does have a few more tricks like  wireless options and wifi, bluetooth for access external keyboards, and skype capabilities if you have the model with the built in camera. You can also take pics but since there is only the front facing camera it might be a bit awkward for taking pics of anything but yourself. And there are also new apps like the mail client, but since I share my tablet and you can't have more than one adult account I am unlikely to use it. Also I miss seeing the glowing power button or the charging battery animation when my old kindle charges. The new one doesn't seem to have it.One odd thing to mention is that the partially subsidized models (which is probably what you'll get if you buy from a physical store - Amazon calls it \"special offers\" on their site) have ads on the screen saver. You buy it a few bucks cheaper but you see the adds. If that bothers you, you can still pay the difference (one time fee - just a few dollars) to not see them though.Overall I like it. If you own a 1st gen and the new features don't appeal to you then stick with the first gen. Otherwise I think its a good buy.

In choosing a new one I considered what I actually wound up using my old tablet for. That turned out to be primarily as reading tablet using the Kindle app, light web surfing and social networking while watching TV or traveling and as a music streaming device. Although I have my Android smart phone loaded with apps I used relatively few on my old tablet. The Kindle seemed a good fit for the price essentially splitting the difference between a reader and a tablet. I chose the WIFI version because I didn't want another charge from my wireless company and found with my old tablet that I could usually find access to a WIFI connection when I wanted to use it. To get the most use out of it one does have to commit to a content relationship with Amazon but there is no fees or contract; just pay as you go. If you already buy your content on Amazon it's really no change. It's cheaper and more flexible than being joined at the hip with Apple ITunes etc.Pros:* The HD Screen has beautiful resolution and streams video nicely.* The lightweight .5 device is a manageable size that has enough real estate to read,  view video, or view photos while still light and comfortable in the hands.* Works well as a Reader, Web surfing and Email as well as social networking and of course shopping on Amazon.Cons:* The User interface is kind of tacky and commercial reminding you constantly that you are connected to Amazon.* App availability is and will be low* Like most tablets it is awkward to view and manage documents.All in all a good fit for me and I suspect many usersUpdate 1/29/2013: I have lived with and traveled with the device and am still reasonably happy with my choice.Pros:* Performs well, no crashes so far.* Ease  in accessing content is excellent* Great for streaming videoCons* The Carousel Home screen interface is REALLY REALLY ANNOYING. Every one I know with a Kindle hates it. It quickly clutters the home screen with an icon for every book, app or website you have visited even once. It cannot be turned off and individual icons have to be removed one at a time; a very tedious process. This is a user unfriendly coercive feature that I hope Amazon will get rid of and soon. It sucks the joy out an otherwise pleasant device.The user blogs are chock full of others who feel the same way but I ahve yet to find a satisfactory remedy if there is one.* The power an volume contact switches are poorly marked, difficult to see/find, and have such a shallow detent that they can be deployed inadvertently. A latched power switch would be much better.So  all in all I am still happy with my choice especially at the price.

The Cons:It boots up slowly.It is too heavy, in my opinion, in relationship to it's size. It has a smaller footprint than the Tab or the iPad, but weighs more (the caveat mentioned in Pros).Buttons are too small, poorly placed, and unresponsive, in my opinion.The software issue I mentioned in Pros was the email app. I use Gmail and the interface presented in the mail app is lacking in functionality and lacks the simplicity Gmail usually presents.It takes a LONG time to recharge, even plugged in to the wallNo access to the Play Store. I realize it's a closed system but it is too closed. Apps I use often that I am unable to access on the Kindle include:DropBox, Directv, Delta, an actual Gmail app, Google drive, Logitech Alert, American Express, and Scrabble.

If you are looking for a device to mostly consume items from the Amazon storefront(s)and do not mind some functionality trade offs, this device will work for you.", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Mostly good, room for improvement and all about usage", "Author": "Caveat Emptor", "ReviewID": "R294HEUKT520ZQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Kindle's HD 8.9 is a product I had waited for since before it was even a rumor.  On balance its actual performance should please some, displease some and mostly be found a welcome addition for those whose digital world is centered in the Amazon eco-system.  It all rather depends on what you are looking for--- even within the Amazon system.  As an owner of the iPad's every generation, a couple of iterations of various android tablets, iPods/iPhones and the odd e-reader, including the original kindle, I believe I have a better grasp than many on the real world factors which judge success and failure in such devices generally.Without trying to reinvent the wheel in this review or go too far afield in measurements and techno-speak, I feel a select group of factors are to the point particularly with this specific item and I will confine comments to those, so that a concise and understandable comparison with not only choices of other devices, but most importantly the unique and singular needs this one fulfills best.Specific factors: size, screen quality, form factor, durability, flexibility, value (cost/what you get) and continued satisfaction in longterm.This version of the Kindle has a number of capabilities: as a limited personal computing device for web-surfing, document handling and light office duty, as an ebook reader, streaming media player, etc., but not to get into the weeds of such a shopping list I will jump to the end and simply state that what it is or should be seen as is as a media player which occasionally is used for some of these other  tasks.  A laptop, even a lightweight and inexpensive ultra-book is going to do office jobs and web-surfing better, a couple of tablets, most notably the Nexus and the iPad are more flexible and higher powered for running apps, with greater libraries of apps to draw on even.  A smartphone is lighter and more portable.  However--beginning with a screen that is absolutely comparable with the deservedly touted retina display, a nimble combination of hardware components that make for stellar responsiveness-- especially for those persons within the Amazon Prime family, this tablet leaves all others in the dust for the breadth of high quality media (movies predominantly) delivered.As a streaming media device the amount of storage is of relatively minor impact as what is left of the baseline 16 gigs should absolutely be more than enough for a few apps, pictures, a moderately robust collection of audio books, books and music (think of this device as the equivalent of your everyday carry bag or commuter backpack for your media).  Since you are streaming your movie content from Amazon and have an infinite storage space for your Amazon content: books, audio books and music; you really shouldn't be storing much on it.If you are more about a purse or a briefcase or if what you are predominantly doing is reading ebooks then you need to look to the 7\" little brother with its lower price, as the greater real estate of the 8.9 inch doesn't do for you or doesn't appreciably add, respectively.  Similarly, if your primary thrust is for your children, since it is easier in smaller hands and comes with all of the same services, the smaller/less expensive version is your sweet spot.It feels solid and sturdy, much more so than a number of similarly sized android tablets.  It has a nicely finished surface for gripping and has an edge to edge glass screen which is scratch resistant and tolerably low in reflective glare.  Though some reports have contested the claim of its speedy wifi connectivity, for streaming video it is second to none and flawless with no discernible stuttering, freezing or hiccuping for buffering.  The pricey, optional Amazon tablet cover/case preserves all the physical aspects of the tablet including its svelte lines, further extending its durability without turning it into a giant plastic brick.Finally, while including most every nicety you find on other tablets bluetooth, hdmi out, support for Exchange based corporate email, Skype and social media integration--- it adds a few of its own, Amazon specific extras like Read to me, Whispersync, integration into the Amazon shopping experience including product suggestions etc, the new X-ray function for most consumable content, a huge lending library of free books and a gigantic and heavily discounted textbook rental library-- making overall value untouchable (again for those in the Amazon system) by any of its tablet competitors.The single, largest deficit is the battery life.  While an improvement on the earlier version of the Fire, the 10 hour claim is pure marketing fantasy.  One of the real pluses, its thinness, doesn't leave enough room for a sufficiently sized battery. The real world battery usage will run between 6-71/2 hours depending on screen brightness being set anywhere from 50-100%.  While minimally acceptable, in the age of similar devices running in excess of 10 hours, this is far from ideal. On the flip side of that, with the speedy charger (which should be free, but isn't) the recharge time from near 0 to fully charged is considerably under the 5 hours they promise---taking roughly 3 1/2 hours or around 2 1/2 hours for 80%.The single biggest asset of the device is Amazon, itself.  Its track record, its overall services, but most of all its customer service--which in my considered opinion is not only light years ahead of its nearest rival, Apple, but in a consumer world of deception, built in obsolescence and recorded telephone loops...the closest thing to absolute perfection any of us will ever see from a business.  For this alone you may bank on the long term reliability and value of your purchase.Final thoughts:  I underscore that this is a media streaming device, if your primary thrust is something else, look elsewhere (though as an affordable electronic babysitter or a way of cutting textbook costs it may likewise prove the singular touchstone for those strongly of those needs).  The 4G LTE option is potentially a killer for Amazon, but not as it exists now.  Until Amazon can work out a deal with a cellular provider based upon the muscle of their client base so that an unlimited or at least a very large allotment per month (5-10 gigs) for a reasonable, flat yearly charge, it is all but useless.  For a media streaming device, what does the present allotment buy you in terms of streaming--1/2 of one movie?  Why would you pay double for the LTE version, essentially so you could do email and download that book which you JUST can't put off another 15 minutes until you reach home, office, Starbucks or the train? I don't think so!!If there were a percentage rating possible I would have given something in the mid to upper 80s, even with the very disappointing battery life, but with stars it has to be 4 until that one problem is substantially solved.  On balance, I love this device.", "Date": "December 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "WOW!!!", "Author": "V.

The reason is that I found the 7 inch screen to small to comfortably watch movies or do much of anything else. Also, the Nexus 7 had terrible wifi reception for me. I would need to stay within about 30 feet of my router to get at least two bars out of four. And forget about getting any reception once I walked out the front door. The Kindle Fire has been much better. Whereas I was not getting any reception bars just outside my front door with the Nexus 7, I am still getting 3 bars out of four with the Kindle Fire 8.9. I am finding that no matter where I go in my home, I am able to get a good reception. Also, the extra two inches and increased resolution of the Kindle Fire makes a world of difference. I talked myself into thinking that a pure version of android, which the Nexus 7 had, would be great. But I found I only need or would use maybe 30 or so apps. So why on Earth would I need over 700,000 apps, or even have the time to look at that many apps?

I ordered it on Friday morning around 7a.m. central time, and requested next day delivery.  Sure enough, it was delivered before noon Saturday.  I immediately signed up for Amazon Prime and ATT 4GLTE service.  I later discovered that you can't access AMAZON PRIME videos from the 4GLTE connection.  Why?  I'd like to know!!!!  You can only access it from the Wi-Fi connection.  Which I CANNOT do when my computer is on (apparently 100% of my ATT DSL speed is good enough to stream Amazon Prime, but 50% is just NOT enough as it kept exiting after about 30 seconds because the vid hadn't started yet.  It wouldn't even BUFFER).  But I have watched vid on it while the computer was off, and it does work fine on my wi-fi connection.  It just needs to be alone.  For the record, I have DSL that is rated at 50X faster than dial-up.  In my area that is the 2nd tier of service, with 2 tiers above it (I believe 75 and 100X faster than dial-up).  The video NEVER exhibited any flaws while I was watching.  I have yet to explore all of the AKFHD's features, but I am enjoying this little black box.  I even found myself \"Borrowing\" a book from Amazon Prime today.  I have to be honest, I did not think I would be able to read a story that was not on paper, but this has changed my mind.  I won't stop collecting paper books, mind you.  If anything I think they will become much more valuable and desirable in years to come.  But the AKFHD is usable and I will most certainly be borrowing and probably purchasing books digitally.  I hope this review helps someone.  And if I may make a suggestion... if and when you order yours, get the QUICK CHARGER (you'll be glad you did), and get a COVER or CASE as well.

Let me just say that one of the reasons I upgraded to the larger tablet is because I want to watch movies on it and not have to watch it on a micro mini screen. The reason I bought the KINDLE as opposed to the Motorola or the Ipad are a bit more involved. I have the Motorola tablet - admittedly an older one - but it was very heavy and it used Windows which meant I had to have a browser - Google or Firefox or whatever. I found it to be sluggish and confusing. Enough said. I refuse to buy into the Apple world simply because they are trying to set themselves up with the snob factor, like - I own a Mercedes Benz, aren't I cool? NO!! You aren't cool when you could have bought TWO really nice Buicks or Hondas for the same price - buy one for yourself and buy one for the poor family in the next, lower class neighborhood who can barely keep their old car running! Oh, I own an Ipad, I paid twice as much as the cool Kindle, but don't I look successful???? NO! You look like somebody who doesn't care that there are people starving and freezing because they can't afford food and oil. Take the extra $300 you paid for the Ipad and donate it to the nearest homeless shelter!OK, I had to get that out of my system because it really is something I do not understand in humanity today. The Kindle - I LOVE the Silk they use. I can move around in my Kindle just as fast as I can in my laptop. I love the book section and spend more than my share of time browsing around. There are a ton of really good FREE books you can get. Plus, unlike the other snobby tablet, you can buy books at other estores, too! Isn't sharing nice? I LOVE the movies. Oh my goodness!! I just got this tablet Tuesday night and luckily, the young lady who took my order had it all set up for me so I just opened it, plugged it in, and there everything was! With the exception of my notepad, which I had to hand type from the old Kindle to the new one. Small issue. Anyway, I plugged in my earphones and flipped into a movie supplier and BOOM!! The sound was outstanding. I cannot tell you how amazing it was. The difference between the sound in this Kindle and the non HD Kindle without Dolby sound is spectacular. I am going to get Titanic out tomorrow JUST for the sound!!! The picture is so clear, honestly is hurt my eyes (I am just too used to blurry pictures, my eyes need to literally adjust to the pure clarity of this larger HD Kindle).So, yes, I LOVE this Kindle. So, why didn't I give it 5 stars? Because, the reason I upgraded from the regular to the tablet HD was that the Keyboard was so wonky, I had trouble ALL THE TIME. I thought it was broken, honestly. But, this one does the same thing. Also? I cannot for the life of me get my email working or Facebook to work. Not a BIG deal since it is fast and easy to get on the web and get there that way, but I just think they could have gotten the glitches OUT of these Kindles by now!!! Those are my two reasons for them losing a star.Another thing I LOVE about the Kindle (in general) is the Carousel. I don't know why it is so easy for me to get around using the Carousel, other than the fact that the things you use most (having Facebook and my email up there would be nice!), books, movies, weather apps, games, magazines, whatever you use most are always right up front on the Carousel when you open it. So convenient! And as for jumping on the web, it's also on a sort of Carousel above the Carousel. In other words, if you want to go to your books section, it is written across the top of the Carousel, along with the movie section, the magazine section, the app section and the web. The web is SO EASY TO USE on Kindle. What I have learned to do is simply leave FB open in a tab (not my email, having had someone TRY to hack it in January), so I go up and hit web and flip open Facebook and voila! There it is! Oh, also, you have the really wonderful Mp3 Amazon Cloud Player which I also LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! Again, not snobby in that you can ONLY by from Amazon, but you can buy from other stores as well (unlike the snobby tablet). I found it easy to use and the sound is spectacular. Again, you can also find some awesome free music there as well.So, yes, I am a Kindle all the way kind of girl. That's my opinion and the fact that this tablet is so thin and light, there is a lot of WOW factors there! One more thing? I want to shout out to the Customer Service Reps at Amazon. Because I am an Amazon junkie, I end up talking to a lot of Customer Service people. Once in a while I get a clunker, but that is rare. I have found most reps to be very helpful. I buy from other sources as well, but hands down, Amazon has the BEST Customer Service that I deal with. So, I HIGHLY recommend, for the money and the experience, getting a Kindle instead of \"other\" tablets. Still need to work on the keyboard, my phone has a MUCH better keyboard than the Kindle, but I can live with it. The set up, the books, the sound, the convenience, the fast pace, is superb. Get thyself out and buy the Kindle. Pay the extra $50 and get the HD, too.

After spending time trying to work with the Amazon Cloud Player, I bailed - the thought of paying for what I was getting free on Google Play wasn't sitting well with me.  I was able to get my music transferred over to the Kindle Fire via USB, but for some reason some of the album artwork covers aren't displaying.  They display fine in iTunes and in Google Play, but not here.  I have no idea if something isn't embedded properly, but........  somehow it all magically worked in Google Play and iTunes.  So, i'm annoyed that I'm spending time trying to figure out what's wrong with 500 of my 3500 music files.  It's important to figure out, because the music display is primarily the album covers - having tons of matching grey ones is not helpful3.  Clunky music interface.  There's no way to play by genre.  Your only options are playlists/artists/albums/songs.  Do I really have to make a playlist for each genre?  Also, the search capability is poor, it's hard to maneuver around even if you know exactly what you're trying to play.  Because I used the USB to transfer my music, I have no playlists transferred, so i have to recreate painfully on the device.  Also because I'm not paying for the cloud, I can't do my playlists on a laptop and transfer them.  Again, it's frustrating because none of these are issues on Google Play. I'm finding I'm pulling out my phone and playing music on my phone 'cause it's easier to maneuver.4.  No categories/folders in the books area.  I am heavily dependent on that on my Kindle Touch to sort into different categories.  Here, I'm supposed to buy another app that doesn't work seamlessly with the Kindle Fire?

DRM has been an issue.  I've purchased several books but couldn't open them due to DRM.  That's frustrating because reading books is what this thing is for and anything purchased from Amazon should work on Amazon's tablet IMHO.  I returned them without a problem.  4.  App selection is limited in Amazon's store.  5.  Browser is buggy.Work arounds: 1.  I install apps from another app store to work around Amazon's limited selection.  I use 1Mobile Market.2.  I've installed an alternate browser, Dolphin, from 1Mobile Market and it works great.", "Date": "December 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire 8.9\" HD", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "R1R3WFIS22O9YK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just a starter observation...................delivery from time of shipment to receiving was snail slow,so if you want it quick eat the cost and pay the extra,I was in no rush but just advising those who need the item for a gift quick.

I have a prime membership which I enjoy quite a bit and my wife and I have purchased numerous Kindle products over the years for ourselves and family members.I have been going back and forth for the last month on purchasing a new tablet with a HD screen. I was torn between the new Ipad, the Asus TF700 and the Kindle fire HD 8.9. On a side note I am heavily invested in Apple as well as I own several of there products including an Apple TV and earlier Ipad models, 1 and 2.In the end I picked the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 because of the beautiful screen and very attractive price. I went to Best Buy to purchase the Kindle only because I had a $50 gift card that I put towards the purchase price, otherwise I would have brought it from Amazon.I came home excited, opened the package and started to set up my new Kindle. The screen is stunning to say the least and it appeared to work much faster then the original Kindle Fire we brought last year. I knew I was going to enjoy my tablet.That is until I plugged it in to charge. I notice that the charge indicator kept turning green which meant it was charging, but then it would stop after a few minutes. I had a charger from our original Kindle Fire we were using and verified it worked with the other Kindles in our household. At one point it appeared the charge was holding so off I went to attend to other errands. When I came back the Kindle was at 17% charge, and the indicator was no longer showing green. I ended up getting another charger in the house and tried that one to no avail. I ended up buying the Kindle accelerated charger and that did not work as well, but it worked for our original Kindle fire. I gave up a little upset but I also understand these things happen to electronic products. I took the Kindle back to Best Buy which was a no fuss process and they took it back with no complaints. It was exchanged for a new Kindle Fire HD 8.9.I went home excited once again and went through the previous process of setting it up. Once done I plugged it into the Kindle charger we had brought and once again the indicator came on that it was charging. At least it was working. I came back about an hour later and saw that the indicator was off and the Kindle had not charged. I could not get the Kindle to charge no matter what I did.Frustrated, I drove once again to Best Buy and they tested it out and had the same outcome. They brought another Kindle Fire to me, but this time they allowed me to open it up in the store to make sure this one worked. Can you believe three different Kindle Fire HD, and all 3 had the same issue. At this point I gave up and ended up purchasing an Asus TF700, which up to this point has worked as advertised and whose screen is equally stunning.Again, I'm not naive to know things happen like this, but after 3 attempts it appears there is an issue because I have now seen other reviews describing the same issue. I love Amazon and our other Kindle products have work with no problem.

I'm completely satisfied with all the other features except email - which I consider one of, if not the most important functions of the internet.  After contacting customer service 4 times on this issue, they reluctantly devulged that the upgraded software version is probably not compatible (yet) with Comcast's email since the 8.9\" tablet is so new (in other words - it was rushed into market). They have no idea when this problem will be addressed by their programmers...not my words - theirs. Here's the problem(s): Comcast email must be set-up manually on the Kindle HD.  After verifying all info with their tech support reps it seemed that the service worked OK once or twice, then it ceased to operate - it actually wiped itself clean from the Kindle upon startup.  When I went back into the email accounts area - Comcast was \"gone\" - and I had to go thru the set-up function again.  This happened several times; it failed to perform properly every day after \"sleeping\" for a while; usually not finding any mail when I had personally sent some from my other computers. By the way, I'm not new at this - I've been around computers for over 40 years and taught electronics in the Army. My temporary solution - I went into my Comcast email account and activated email \"forwarding\" to my Gmail account; then set-up my Gmail account on the Kindle HD.

I want to love it, but it has some clunky features that make it not very loveable to me.  I am also an owner of a first generation Fire which I loved.  If it didn't have charging issues, I would not have sought a replacement.I will start with the good points.The screen is lovely, large and clear.Overall, it is not heavy for the size.There are more apps available on this version and some are ones that I had been wishing for.The browser is much more stable.The e-mail program is far superior.Now for the bad points.The charging port could not be in a worse location.  It is right at the bottom of the screen.  For someone holding the tablet while charging it is either pointing at you, potentially causing harm to the port or pointing straight up which means it is in your way constantly.  It was on the side on the first generation and is on the HDX so I guess lessson learned from this model.  If you like to watch video while using a standing cover like I do, you have to delicately balance it on the edge of a table or dresser so the charging cord can be plugged in.The mini HDMI port is in the same location with the same issues.The power button is inferior, it is hard to push, it is a small rectangular button flush with the edge of the screen.  It also does not have any indicator light.  The only way to know that your tablet is charging is to open the cover, turn it on and look at the corner of the screen.  That's also the only way to know the charge is complete.  The first gen had a nice round button on the side, it glowed orange while charging or starting up and green when the charge was complete.These issues seem minor until you realize how much time you are going to be charging this tablet.  It takes hours to charge, probably close to 4 or 5 for a full charge.  I use the tablet for about 30 minutes in the morning, surfing the web and checking e-mail and then in the evening for the same for another 45 minutes or so and then to stream 2 hours or so of video.  That fully depletes the battery daily.  If I forget to charge during the day, I have to have it plugged in while I stream the video which requires dealing with the charging cord hanging out of the bottom.In short, I should have ponied up the money for the HDX, but I didn't check these features before buying.

Speed isn't an issue, usability is. I sometimes do not visit links because I don't want to fight the silk browser. This would be less of a problem if not for the second issue, which is huge. Kindle's are locked out of many apps for android devices. I knew this going in and almost did not buy one for this reason. You simply cannot download many android apps. It sucks. Can't replace the silk browser. Can't use many apps.I would recommend the Kindle for someone that is not very interested in app variety and if you can get them for a cheap price. Not worth the MSRP, but they frequently go on sale. If you are a heavy Prime video user and don't require much variety in apps, or want one to read from they are worth while I guess.

Still, it does automatically turn the unit off/on when closed/opened, which works well.The power cord goes into the bottom of the unit, so it won't sit up straight unless I prop it on two separate pads, and the cord gets in the way when you're sitting with the Kindle in your lap.Before I got the case, the Kindle would turn itself on in the middle of the night, often waking my wife and I up.  Inevitably, I'd find that the battery was dead.  The case mostly (but not completely) solved that problem.Half of the time, when I try to turn volume up or down, I hit the power switch, and have to restart.

So we bought a Barnes and Noble Nook.  The nook quickly proved to be a poor tablet.  Very limited utility and awful to configure and use.  And exceptionally difficult customer service (bought at a university bookstore three hours from our house and the local B&N; store could not accept the return - return was expensive and difficult).So we bought a Kindle Fire HD.  Now it is worth noting that we have three black and white kindle devices in the house.  The Kindle Fire HD is a whole new device - it is a computer.Good Points*Fast response times - operating on our \"n\" wifi network the machine is very fast*Good selection of apps and media (our interest is movies)*excellent screen quality - movies really pop*great battery life - generally runs eight hours before next charge*My son is dyslexic - the \"immersive reading\" option for many books is fantastic - my son hears the book being read, by a talented human not a computer, while he watches the words highlighted - can be run at slower speeds without materially changing the comprehensionWeak Points*The primary interface is poor - the apps are (apparently) only offered in a \"ribbon\" which is fine until you have tons of apps, books, etc.  There are favorite lists and other ways to search but all are a pain.  I don't know why they can't use the accepted device of having all the apps in small pictures on sortable pages for quick location and use.  This is an \"Achilles heel\" for the device and must be pushing away potential buyers.*The charger is extra - who sells an electronic device without the charger (it runs off of any USB charger so we are able to use our own kindle chargers and the computer)Overall for the price this is a very good value.

Hanenberg \"Bob\"", "ReviewID": "RFVTDEVOCAD73", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For normal reading I use the Kindle Paperwhite.  I like the fact that it looks like paper.  Like paper it depends on an external source of light.  I do not like reading on screens where the light shines at me from behind the screen.Which is what the Kindle Fire does.  However, the Paperwhite is not useful for books which are colorful, or which have irregular fonts or complex formatting.  I originally bought the Kindle Fire because I wanted to own a certain book on plants.  This book was full of pictures.  A friend of mine owned it, but I could not find another copy anywhere.  It was an old book and out of print, the author had long since died and there was no copy in any library in the state of California and none for sale anywhere on the internet.So I borrowed my friend's book, bought a Kindle Fire and scanned the entire book into a group of PDF files.  There is a fine app for viewing pdf files on the Kindle Fire.  The photographs were perfectly clear, and using my fingers with a reverse pinching motion, I could enlarge any part of a photograph.  You could get the same effect with a paper book using a magnifying glass, but this was easier.Later I found similar uses for the Kindle Fire.  I had always wanted to own a facsimile of the First Folio, but I never could bring myself to buy one.  However, there is a free pdf file of the First Folio on the internet.  Now I have it on my Kindle Fire.  To my surprise, I found it was more satisfying to read King Lear in the First Folio than in a modern, annotated version.  I had also wanted for a long time to own a facsimile of a medieval book called the Tres riches heures du Duc de Berry, but it would have been too expensive to buy one.  I could not find the whole thing on the internet, but a found a part of it as a pdf file, and now can look at it on the Kindle Fire.  Or: I was helping my nephew apply to college.  It turns out to be an easy thing to download an entire college handbook of several hundred pages, and read it in its original formatting.  Later I wanted a government report on the economic value of college majors.  They give this out for free as a pdf file, and with the Kindle Fire I could read the whole 200 page book in its original formatting.I read magazines on the Paperwhite.  But certain graphs, tables and pictures do not show up in the Kindle Paperwhite.  Images, even at their best, loose much of their value on the Paperwhite. Sometimes, as in the Economist's edition for the Paperwhite, the images are skipped altogether.  I keep finding something like \"See figure 1\" and there is no figure 1.  Or, you might have a tabulation, but when you zoom in on it, all you get is a blank screen.So when I find it absolutely necessary to look at a graph, table or image, I open the same magazine in the Kindle Fire, which has no trouble displaying any image, tabulation or graph.The Kindle Fire is also a tablet.  Young people will like it for this reason.  You can do many of the things you do on a laptop, such as write documents and send emails.  I read my email in the morning, and look at the weather forecast, before turning on my computer.  But I do not do complicated work on it.Movies are a joy on this machine.  Netflix (the movies which are streamed) and Amazon's Prime videos come through flawlessly.  I find the speakers of the Kindle Fire adequate for most movies.The main problem, aside from the fact that the Kindle Fire is useless in bright light and irritating when reading long texts, is that it is heavy when reading in certain positions.  I like to read lying on my back, but the Kindle Fire is too heavy to hold in front of my eyes for very long (I have the larger 8.6 inch display).So I bought a stand to support it (\"LEVO Deluxe iPad Floor Stand for all iPads Galaxy Xoom Nook and Other eBooks and Tablets\").  You can attach any eBook to this stand.  I often fix the Kindle Fire to the stand, which has a long arm which can position the device at any point in space.  I lie on my back in bed at night and watch movies.  I use the same stand for reading on my Kindle Paperwhite.  You cannot use the stand to read a paper book, because there is no mechanism for turning the pages.  But with an eBook you can swipe the screen to turn a page.There is something very decadent in all this.", "Date": "October 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "I use it every day....all day long", "Author": "Pepper", "ReviewID": "R33H9ZSNMCJR5R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am so pleased with this item.

Like so many limitations it is probably related to \"protecting\" digital content \"property rights.\" Amazon has never claimed that the micro HDMI port delivers audio but you sure have to dig deep to find this out...Amazon markets the HDMI capability of the Fire HD 8.9\" to gamers and movie watchers and says nothing about its value for other uses.  One nice feature of Kindle Fire HD's HDMI implementation is that it does deliver the text of Kindle books to a large screen; at least it does on my setup.

Magazines work better on the 8.9. Of course the movies are a better view on the larger screen too.  The 8.9 is not that much larger to stick in brief case or pack. Finally, overall I just like to pick it up and have the larger screen. Maybe it's related to my idea of a  pickup versus a small car. I will always like larger size and take the truck.

I bought the Kindle over an IPad on the advise of my son. My 3 year old grandson uses it and is very good at it making it a great teaching tool. If you have young children do yourself a big favor and get one they will love it. I only gave it 4 stars because I think the charger should come with it. For me it is like buying a new car and having to pay extra for the tires.", "Date": "January 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wonderful!", "Author": "S.

The screen is large (good for my senior eyes) and there is a feature which I just discovered where you can touch it and it gives you an enlarged pop up of the screen. It's in the upper left corner and lol looks like a pair of eyeglasses. My battery ran down a couple of times and I realized that I was not shutting it down but just putting it to sleep. I'm smarter now. There are probably tons of things that I don't know still but will find out, since I just got this as a Christmas present and it's the end of January.

I believe the nook doesn't do that. I am educated, but my vocabulary has always been a stumble block to my love of reading. I never bother to look up in dictionary because it gets to be so time consuming. Theres no b&n; in my area, closest is 90 miles. So I dont really shop there.

I own the original Fire 7\" as well, so I'm familiar with the product already.  I wasn't expecting an iPad, so I'm a bit less critical than many of the reviewers on here.What I like:- The screen is phenomenal.  Pics, videos, apps...all of them display clearly and crisply.  The best I've seen (and my wife has an iPad 4)- The updated carousel - I actually like the recommendations...helps me see what else is out there- Wi-Fi connected easily, and works great...thinking that most people are having issues with their service provider, not the Fire.- Ease of use- very intuitive...my kids picked it up in no time!- Cloud- I have a ton of music, and I can access it easily as long as I have wi-fi (which I do at work and home, so why pay for 4G?).- Overall speed- MUCH quicker and more responsive than the original Fire.- Prime - I don't know who wouldn't pay the $79 per year for this gem.  Between free shipping and free movies...it's a no brainer.- Size- I always felt the 7\" screen was just too small for anything besides reading.  The 8.9 is perfect for reading (love the new two-page layout), watching movies, playing games, typing...great job Amazon!What's Not-so-great:- Silk - After all the hoopla regarding speed with this browser setup, I'm still left unimpressed.  Hangs up often, lags, takes too long to get rolling.  It's not horrible (I remember dial-up), but just not what you'd expect with all the lingo thrown around.- Apps - Let me say that if an app is designed for the Fire HD, then it's amazing on this device.  However, even some of the simplest apps (Feedly, for one) have issues.  I know these can (and hopefully will) be resolved as more people move to these devices, but it is an issue nonetheless. And I'm still not sure of how I update an app...some of the technical aspects could be made simpler to go along with the overall ease of using this tablet.Overall, I'm extremely pleased with the Fire.  I wasn't going to upgrade just yet, but when Amazon offered it @ a $50 discount, I figured \"why not?\" I don't regret the investment one bit.  If you go into this expecting an iPad, you'll be disappointed.  You get what you pay for with the iPad and Apple's ecosystem.  The Fire is designed to immerse you in Amazon, and if you're like me and buy your books and music there (it's cheaper btw), it's an amazing device.", "Date": "December 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "HD 8.9", "Author": "Frederick Donahoe", "ReviewID": "R2F4HK8EO66KC5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "HD 8.9The quality of the movies are great.

It's size was ok, but hearing of new Kindle Fire HD with the larger 8.9 screen was too good to resist. I am an artist and having a handy portfolio at my disposal is essential. I ordered the 32 GB version to allow me to display all the bodies of work from photography, fine art to my own animations. The display is sharp and clear and the size is perfect. With all the high resolution art I placed on my Kindle plus my massive book collection, it has hardly mad a dent in my memory. All the other wonderful things packed into this device are just added attractions that make me grin with complete satisfaction every time I turn it on. No longer disturbing my wife to watch movies in the middle of the night, my headphones and netflix or reading a book in bed. How many ways can I say I love my Kindle HD 8.9  My only complaint is the camera. A camera that point only at me is useless, I'm not into video chat, but I am into photographing and would like to see a camera that is better than 1 mega pixel, low res. (10mp hi res.) Would love to see the lens on both sides. As I mentioned, I am an artist, if I could combine framing out a shot with my Kindle and then instantly it take into one of my apps, like photoshop touch, that would be a big plus for me.

Rhodes", "ReviewID": "R1L32CWT9OXCFE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Over the years technology has changed so much.  And so quickly.  I still remember when the first Kindle came out and pretty much changed the world.  It was a revolution for book readers.  And then other things happened.  The release of the iPad, for instance, which caused everyone to jump up and make a tablet.  Now there are so many to choose from that when I considered buying a tablet I wasn't sure what to go with.  In the end I went with the Kindle Fire HD.  The price was good and I've been a part of the Amazon community for years on end.  I haven't been disappointed in my purchase one bit.  There are a couple of small gripes that add up, but nothing much.I won't spend much time talking about the technical specs of the Kindle Fire HD.  I have the 16GB one that's 8.9 inches.  It comes with a USB cord, but doesn't come with one of those actual chargers.  This isn't too bad, because if you already have a smart phone that charger will suffice, but if you don't have a charger already it's kind of silly that you get the cord but not the charger itself and you immediately need to pay $20 on top of this.Setting up your kindle is pretty simple.  If you've already got an Amazon account you can connect to that easily.  If you are not an Amazon Prime member you can start a free trial.  If you have a Kindle, however, I urge you become a part of Amazon Prime.  It'll be a good decision in the long run.  It not only gives you some pretty decent shipping prices, but for people who own a Kindle Fire you'll be able to have access to a few things you wouldn't otherwise, such as television shows on the IMDB.  Or you can \"borrow\" books for free from the Amazon Library for as long as you want without having to pay a dime.  If you have a kindle, you might as well get prime on top of it.  It's not bad for a years time.The tablet itself is extremely light and feels pretty nice and sleek.  There are two speakers on the back near the bottom that give off some good sound, but you can always plug in head phones or a speaker if you want.  There is also a camera that should be at the top if you hold it for a landscape view, and on the left if you're holding it like a book.  The orientation will adjust automatically (though you can lock the orientation if you so choose to), but some applications and games will have a preset orientation you cannot change.  Likewise, I would highly suggest a case and a screen protector for your Kindle fire HD immediately.  It's light and simple.  Perfect for on the go stuff.  All the more reason to have a case.  And if you're going to constantly be having your fingers on it a screen protector will do nice so that the screen doesn't smudge.The display itself is pretty crisp.  Everything being displayed in fine HD.  You can adjust the brightness in the settings menu if you want just about any time you want with a pretty easy interface of a menu.  Even if you're in the middle of an app or a book you can access the settings by sliding your finger (or stylus, as I prefer to use) down from the top and it allows quick access to things like your settings, notifications wi-fi access, etc.  The user interface of the Kindle Fire HD is pretty easy stuff.  And no matter where you are it's easy to return to the home menu at any time.Any time you leave a program, app or book, it will be on display in your \"carousal\" which allows you to go through every item.  Recently downloaded items also appear here.  If your carousal gets too crowded you can always hold your finger (or stylus) on the item and select to remove it from the carousal.  You can also put it on your favorites for easier access.  The carousal is a good idea, but I've found that mine gets crowded a little too easy.  I use a lot of apps and read a lot of books and from time to time browse the web.  Every now and then my carousal gets too full and I have to go through removing stuff from it one by one by one.  There is no option to universally clear your carousal.There's Bluetooth and Wifi on the Kindle Fire HD.  I did not purchase the one with 4G so I can't tell you about that.  It's pretty easy to connect to the internet.  And it'll be able to store all kinds of wireless networks in its memory.  The only problem that I have is that the web browser itself is not that good.  More often than not when I'm surfing the web and read news stories or going to certain sites that no application exist for, I'll get a message that the browser has stopped working or that the tab I'm using has stopped working.  These messages are not infrequent in the slightest. I would highly recommend downloading a different browser as opposed to using the default browser.  Most other browsers are a lot better.Of course, one of the biggest tenants you're looking for is probably the apps.  And there are a lot of apps to choose from on the Kindle Fire HD.  Cheap as well as expensive.  The good news is that you can always get a sense of what you're in for because there are always reviews for each app.  They download fast (most of the time, if they're not too big).  There are 16GB of space available on my tablet (there is a 32GB one available, if you wish) and even that feels like a lot.  Apps and books are pretty small and take up nearly no space whatsoever.  In fact, most of the space on mine is occupied by the professional narration on some of the books I have.  Case in point, unless you're feeling like you'll download tons of movies or things which take up whole gigabytes of space, the 16GB hard drive is more than enough to satisfy.When you download movies they come up very crisp indeed, but I don't download a lot of movies to my tablet.  I use my Ultraviolet account a lot, but that uses the internet to stream from my collection (and a handy little application called Flixster for that).  It's the books I'm more interested in.  There are LOTS of classic literature books you can download for free.  When you download books you can add professional narration to them as well.  Sometimes it's free and sometimes it isn't.  It's more or less like putting an audiobook version to your standard book.  Most times the professional narration is unabridged.  I've yet to find an abridged one.  For some books there is still an option to tap to hear text read aloud, but since it's not the \"professional\" narration it's just a robotic voice that really drones on (and it's boring... very boring).  So if you feel the need to listen to your books, the professional narration is pretty amazing.  If you feel like reading, however, you can adjust the settings by changing the background, font size and even the font itself.  But the best feature is the ability to \"X-Ray\" the book.  You can see certain terms used a lot and how often.  You can read about certain things that other kindle users highlighted.  But you can go deeper and read about the author himself or herself.  You can look up terms and locations.  You'll instantly be taken to the web if you see something you may not know about and you're curious to learn.  It's overall pretty handy to X-Ray a book.  You can also make as many notes as you like on your book.When you're finished with a book (or when you X-Ray) it always offers suggestions of where to go from there or what to read next.  It's always offering suggestions and you can always find reviews if you like to help you out.You can use that USB cord to connect your Kindle Fire HD to your computer at any time and put documents from your computer or even a few other things if you desire.  Sometimes this is pretty nice.  I was able to transfer documents to my Kindle from my laptop pretty easily.  This includes music and movies if you want them.  And the Kindle can read quite a few formats.There are a few things that can be urksome about the Kindle Fire.  Some are little and some are bigger problems.  The first is that it isn't easy to access the files.  Unless you download an outside app for that.  You can get into the basic stuff like your music, books and movies.  But if you want to go just a little deeper you have to download an outside app for that.  Likewise, it's difficult to move things from one folder to another.  If you put a document on your Kindle Fire and it automatically puts it in the books (I'm not sure why mine did this) it's not easy to move it over without going onto your laptop to do so, or downloading a document manager app of sorts.  It just seems strange to me that management type options wouldn't be built into the Kindle itself from the get go.  Instead you need an app.  It's a free app, but why should I have to do this?Another strange problem I've run into is that my kindle, from time to time, freezes or just goes blank for no apparent reason.  Then it'll suddenly start rebooting.  I'm not sure what happens.  This doesn't happen often, but it happens often enough to be noticeable.  There were also times when it lagged so much that I wasn't sure if my clicking on certain links, apps or books was actually registering.  Come to find out that sometimes it registers just a little too late.  And other times it just so happens my Kindle has frozen on me and I have to shut it down and restart it.  Again, not too often, but often enough to be noticeable.  I have also run into times when it can't seem to seek out the wireless network in the area.  The solution is--you guessed it--I have to shut down and reboot the Kindle Fire HD (although for this little problem sometimes putting it in sleep mode and then bringing it out works just the same).  Like the other two issues, this doesn't happen often--but it happens often enough to be noticeable.Overall, though, I like my Kindle Fire HD a lot.  I wouldn't trade it for anything.  Not an iPad or a Nexus 7 or any other tablet.  The problems I've encountered aren't big enough and it's very possible that no one is experiencing some of the things I experience at all.  I've been enjoying my Kindle Fire because it's made a lot of my life simpler.  Particularly when I travel.  It's nice to have all my books in one place without having to have a bag full of six or seven when I'm out.  And I can also get magazine subscriptions and go to Youtube or whatever without hassle at all.  If you're looking for a nice, inexpensive tablet, then the Kindle Fire HD is a pretty good deal.  You'll end up having to splurge a few extra bucks for some much needed accessories (charger, case, screen protector and stylus are the ones I recommend most) but in the end it is definitely worth while to do so.

After comparing most of the popular tablets, I was down to the iPad and the Fire 8.9 HD 4G. The iPad was a bit more expensive, and had more features and more apps, but the Kindle allows you access to a lot more free media if you get an Amazon Prime account, which we had planned to do anyway.(Honestly, if you want productivity and real-world WORK capability, like document production, etc., buy an iPad, or really, buy a laptop. The laptop will be cheaper.)The screen is bright,clear and the video and audio quality is very good. The touch screen can be a bit balky at times, though. I'd recommend buying a stylus. It is far smoother with that than with your finger.Make sure your hands are clean and not sweaty or greasy.The loading is fast...VERY fast if you have either a good WiFi signal, or are connected to 4G. Which is another issue. 4G is not always available...if you are on trips, driving, like we do, then you will find a lot of areas where you will find yourself hooked to 3G or Edge instead, which is much slower. Grrrr.Forget streaming video if you are on Edge. It's too slow. However, you CAN download content, and then play it back at your leisure...but some HD movies are larger than your memory, unless you have the 64Gb memory, so there's another issue.Also, you cannot play ANY Flash content, like, say, a lot of YouTube videos, and some commercial websites. This is not Amazon's fault. Adobe no longer supports ANY mobile devices, including phones or iPads.Don't worry...there is a work-around. You just download the ES File Explorer from the app store(which, believe me, you are going to want anyway. It's a super useful app.) and then you download the Dolphin web browser, and then (finally!) you can go get Flash Player 11 for mobile devices, which runs with Dolphin, but not Silk. (Silk is the web browser that comes with your Kindle.) Supposedly, in the future, this will not be an issue since most websites are supposed to be switching to HTML5.Bottom line: We pretty much like it. If we had it to do over, we'd still buy two more Kindle Fire's, in spite of the above noted glitches. It still has more upside than downside. The huge availability of media content of all types makes up for the shortcomings.

I typically have to look.Location of USB/HDMI - Really bad design and I can't believe no one caught this in development very annoying.On Screen Keyboard - The return key is often missing and it makes working with some apps difficult.Lacking Device to play through wireless? - Have not found a way to mirror this over wireless (like Apple TV).I found most apps I use on the iPad to be available either at the kindle store or via adding another app store.  My issues with the power button were mostly overcome by adding a case because now it comes back on automatically when I open the case so I only need to find the power button if I need to turn the device off completely(almost never).  My brother and I both bought the kindle at the same time and I love mine overall, but he was so annoyed about the issues with the on screen keyboard and the fact that twitter doesn't allow copy and paste in their andriod app that he will probably return his.

Plus, I knew there was no charger in the box since I had read the description before ordering! Thus, it was not a surprise!3.  Setup:  Yes, it was a bit confusing when I took it out of the box and there was no directions and no clear on/off switch.

All books in one folder. All Apps in one folder (or subdivide them once get a lot), Music in one folder... I feel like I am going to forget about things that \"fall\" to the back of the carousel.2. E-mail.  I am not sure if I am missing something, but I wish there was some kind of notification of when I get new e-mail.  The iPad beeps just like my computer.  As far as I can tell on the Fire, the only way to tell if I have new mail is to go in and check it.  Am I missing something?3.  Apps.  While I am satisfied with the apps, the number of apps is much smaller than what I am used to on an iPad.4.  4G.

This is where it breaks down. While the picture quality on the Kindle itself is great, the picture quality on our TV was horrible. The colors where way off and the picture was hazy. Almost like viewing a 3D movie without the glasses. We were hoping to use this feature when we travel, but it doesn't look like it now.Then there was the connecting the Kindle to my husbands PC to download files and pictures. It never could find the device driver to install, and therefore he is unable to connect and download anything. When he went to the help screen at Amazon, he notice that this is a very common problem. He tried some of the fixes, but nothing worked. He then started a chat with the technical support and that was a joke. After an hour, the tech support came to the conclusion that my Kindle was defective, even though many other customers were having the same problem. He then tried connecting to my computer and it connected right away. He advised the tech support person, and asked where he could get the device driver to download to his computer, since that seem to be the problem. The tech support response was that they don't make one since the Kindle doesn't need it....Really!!! So, now to download files from his computer, he has to download to a flash drive, upload to my computer, then download to the Kindle. Very cumbersome, but it's all we have, since Amazon doesn't have a workaround themselves.If you are only going to use the Kindle by itself, it is a great tablet, but beware of it's shortcomings, if you intend to use it for some other purpose. Also, beware of their tech support, my husband basically knew more than they did!!", "Date": "December 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Definitely meets my high expectations!", "Author": "Cory", "ReviewID": "R2QIWBSV4H9G9J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love the new Kindle Fire.

I hemmed and hawed over getting a Fire because we already had 3 nook tablets (a decision made due to BN having a better presence in kids books when we started three years ago- and the 1st tablet was for a 2 year old.  Not a device issue.)  And didn't want to have to start over with apps and such.  Then they started Kindle FreeTime and I knew it was time to go all Kindle (the grownups all read on Kindles!)FreeTime is an amazing value for kids.  It gives them access to all the books and apps that they want.  Not cheesy free or 99cent variety ones- but name brand Disney and the like that you would be paying $12-$15/book for.The parental controls- if you use them like I do, to make sure your kid doesn't accidentally get on the web or delete or buy stuff- are a little cumbersome.  Basically I want to be the one to turn wifi on/off.  Well, once you are in freetime- that requires a ridiculous number of password entries.  You have to enter your password to even bring up the menu to get to turning the wifi on, then enter it again to enter that section of the menu, and then yes, a third time to actually turn it on.  YIKES!  The nukes don't have this much security!  And if your child is sitting there watching- they are going to learn your password pretty quick.  Luckily my kid isn't trying to bypass me- but if you have a more sneaky kid, be forewarned.  It is easier too exit freetime and do any adjustments, then reopen freetime. (even if you remove turning wifi on/off from being controlled- there is still no way to get to the menu to turn it on or off without entering your password.  It is crazy. I would just leave the wifi on, but it uses so much battery when we aren't using the fire.As a parent, I think once I have entered my password to get into parental controls- that should be enough.  I don't want to use it again at every step.

It has been a source of enjoyment. I use it for videos, music, shopping, email and many other things. The enjoyment part ended recently when the Silk Browser became an object of frustration. If you don't know, the Silk Browser is Kindle's access to the internet. It is down, not working, more than it is up and working. When you are in the middle of completing some business, and the Silk Browser goes down,  you get to start all over when it comes back, when/if it comes back. This creates a very frustrating situation. This happens too many times. Amazon has a fix for this but it means putting your entire Kindle content in the cloud. This creates a ton of frustration and download time. Trouble is, the fix doesn't last and soon, you are back with an internet browser that does not work. Forget it if you think Amazon will give you a refund on this defective product. NO WAY. This is the attitude of the largest retailer in the world? Give me a break. If you want a tablet that is internet worthy, do not buy a Kindle Fire HD 8.9\". Amazon finally, after much unpleasant argument, sent me a replacement of the same model I had purchased. Do I expect a better browser from this paltry offering. No. In the mean time, I have purchased an iPad.

My husbands ipad, our wireless phone, stereo and cell phones all worked.  After numerous calls, speaking with numerous technicians and supervisors, calling our network and replacing our home router and then receiving another kindle (this is now the 3rd), none of them would hold a charge or stay connected to the network.  I spoke with someone who was extremely helpful and sent me return labels for both and I was told I would be refunded 80% of what I paid for the kindle, which I feel unacceptable, since none of them worked. As of this date, I have not received my refund nor do I have a kindle.  I am extremely disappointed with Amazon and try not to purchase items because of this issue.

These tablets use a customized Android Ice Cream Sandwich operating system. Apps have to be purchased from the Amazon App store for installation in order to be supported by Amazon. Apps purchased  through the App store and installed may not perform properly and may not be supported by Amazon. By default the tablets are set up to only  download and install Apps from the Amazon App store. You can change this setting but Amazon does not recommend it. Many of the Android apps that you are used to using on other Android tablets and smart phones are not available for the Kindle fire HD.I have used these tablets to stream video from two sources, Amazon Prime and Netflix. The main issue I have with the video streaming is when you first start streaming the video will not be at full resolution for the first 60 seconds or so and is choppy and blurry. Exactly what causes this is unknown but it happens on both Amazon Prime and Netflix and on all of the Fire HD tablets that I have used. It is not a wireless or bandwidth issue as I have much more capacity than these tablets need for streaming.This is a great tablet for using on Skype. It works well and the video quality is great and the battery lasts a good 5 hours when using video messaging. I initially had issues with Skype SMS using the touchscreen keyboard. The cursor would not stay at the end of the sentence being typed and the keyboard would not function properly reacting slowly and not entering the letters correctly. After two replacement Kindle Fire HD 8.9 inch tablets, Amazon changed the version of Skype they had in the App store and the issue is resolved I am happy to say.The Amazon Silk browser works well but Flash is not supported so video sometimes does not work using the browser. The browser operates well and is easy to navigate.The Kindle Fire HD does a great job with e-mail, supporting all of the popular e-mail providers as well as corporate e-mail. Amazon brings all your e-mail accounts together in a single application.If you are planning on using this tablet in place of a Laptop it would not be a good choice. The productivity software available is not that good and is not compatible with Windows based programs such as Office. If you plan to do  lot of typing such as in e-mails I suggest you buy the Amazon Basics Bluetooth keyboard to use instead of the on screen keyboard.If you are looking for a tablet to use as an e-reader, to stream video on the device or to your tv via HDMI port and access your e-mail it is a decent choice.

I was so happy I caused two of my relatives to buy it as well. However the honeymoon period is long gone. after a couple of months the performance started declining considerably. Although I removed most of the apps I am not using and keep good eye on cleaning the cache etc, it did not improve at all. My main use of the tablet is internet browsing and there you are very limited with your browser options. Silk, the default browser, is the worst I have ever seen. If Amazon needs to fire some employees, it should start with the developpers of this nasty browser. It crashes a minimum of 5-6 times in less than 30 minutes of browsing. Otherwise, it is extremely slow and mostly inadequate in performance. Amazon's arrogance to create a monopoly over that browser is really irritating as well. (we can not get puffin e.g) Apart from the browsing experience, the app selection is limited and the general operation is slow and unreliable. It may take an easy 60 seconds to start up. Besides, one of the three items I purchased had a charging problem showing 0% no matter what and shuts down as we disconnect from the charger. This is someting that you dont expect in a device that is less than a year old.But apart from the negative issues, it , for sure, has some worthy parts.

I read reviews and ended up purchasing it instead of the iPad air. It arrived very quickly. I set it up and began it play around with its features. Here are my thoughts:I won't get into the pros too much because I'm pretty sure those are quite easy to see: screen, sound, size, price. I just want to get into the reasons why I sent it back.First the internet connection was really finicky when starting it up after it was locked. It would take quite a while to find the connection and sometimes required a restart to connect again.One of the main reasons I bought this was so I could video chat with my family. I couldn't get Skype to function properly. The audio was so quiet I couldn't hear anything people were saying. It would freeze the whole tablet, requiring me to force a restart. It is incredibly disappointing to have to force restarts on a brand new device. I troubleshot it for a couple of days, uninstalling/reinstalling and what not, but I couldn't get it to function. I'm sure I could have contacted amazon for some more troubleshooting, but I decided to send it back before reaching that point.I was really uncomfortable using the carousel function. It was neat to see the icons so big, but that was about it. Other than that it seemed like a huge waste of space to have only one or two massive icons available on the screen at one time.The App Store left a lot to be desired. There just weren't that many interesting options. Maybe I was just spoiled by my iPhone, but it feels really lacking to me.The straw that broke the camels back, prompting me to immediately return it, was something so simple and tiny: I wasn't able to save pictures from my email. How silly. A function that simple should be included without a doubt.In the end, it looks good, feels good, and sounds good. It was the tiny stuff that frustrated me to the pointof returning it. I didn't want to troubleshoot the device just to get it operational. I didn't want to deal with a finicky internet connection. I didn't like the lack off App Store options. Skype was a mess.

Out of curiosity, I tried reading on my boyfriend's Kindle Fire and was instantly hooked. I love that the Kindle Fire HD has a larger screen (to avoid wearing reading glasses, I read with a large font) and I love that I can see the book covers in color. And while reading in the dark I can dim the screen to a comfortable level. What I do not like is that I cannot arrange my books into categories, but this is an inconvenience with which I can live. I find the carousel simply annoying and wish there was a way to turn it off.Anyone who has a Kindle Fire absolutely must sign up for Amazon Prime in order to take advantage of the free videos. (No, I don't work for Amazon.) I didn't think I would enjoy watching movies and television shows on such a small screen, but the picture is unbelievably sharp and crisp, the sound is good, and is even better with headphones (not earbuds) on, and you can watch in bed without disturbing your partner.I can't speak to all the many other features because, as yet, I've not had time to try them, but I will update my review as I do.UPDATE: 1/27/2014. I lowered by rating from five stars to three, and had considered giving only two. Lately, my Kindle Fire has constantly been freezing up as I'm reading and, sometimes, restarting it does not fix the problem, so that I have to dig out my old Paperwhite to continue reading. I have had no problems with the Paperwhite, only the Fire. Sometimes, when I turn on the Fire, I get a blank, black page - no carousel, no bookshelves, no nothing.

The screen is awsome ! BUT he get it tonight for the first night of Hanukkah so I will report the look on his face when he opens it and uses it. I only set it up for him and played with it a little so the updated review will straight from my my 5 year old later tonight. But so far so GREAT +_ free shipping thanks !***UPDATE***DAD THIS IS AWSOME !!! And that is straight from my son's mouth !! Wehn he first opened the Kindle he was a little confused, it had his name and Free Time was all set up for him to go, but he was not used to seeing content just for his age. To be honest he was used to his I Pad touch and my wifes IPad.So after a little selling and showing him that he could have  most of his normal games and Netflix on the same pad he started to explore the free time.And to be honest no BS he has not switched back to the reg Kindle side of the pad other than to watch Netflix. HE LOVES IT & ITS ALL HIS books games etc etc. And I dont have to worry if the shows or games are right for his age.For all of you parents who have tech savy little ones let me tell you that the \" Free TIme\" for 2.99 is OUTSTANDING ! There are easy over 1000 books all age driven the games are great & the vids are a little young for my boy but he has found enough to keep him busy. Its just so much for 2.99 !The pad & the free time app are perfect !!Update ***** jan 1 the Kindle keeps crashing and freezing I have reset it twice to try to fix but it keeps bogging down freezing and apps just close and stop working. I don't get or maybe I do we are through the 30 period and it's prob going to totally fail. I thought this was a pretty fast pad but after using an ipad air and a hp slate this thing IS SLOWWWWW buyer beware. I still give the free time 10 stars fantastic but you can't add music to that side AND maybe Amazon should let us parents include some apps from the reg kindle side to the free time side have to drop it to ** 2 stars  just for the frustration maybe someone can give me a hint on this freezing and app crashes !!ANOTHER UPDATE NOW THE FIRE SAYS I AM OUT OF STORAGE SPACE ????!!! My son only has 15 apps and its full ?? are you kidding me my ipad has like 40 apps and still has a ton of space this stinks lowering it to a 1 star a total waste of money I should have bought him a mini thanks Amazon !!", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Refurbished Advantage", "Author": "P Steedman \"Paul Steedman\"", "ReviewID": "R26MGC9E5MQ8AJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There is absolutely no difference between the refurbished unit and the new item.

BUT! !!!!!!", "Author": "David Ecale", "ReviewID": "R36633LI3FPEG4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was planning on waiting another year for the KF HDX 8.9 as I'm not *that* rich and it's price was just too much for my pocket, but this unit's price (refurbished, 64gb, 4G LTE, SP Offers) minus a 20% discount sold me. ... That and my Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 (original) just plain blows up with the latest Kindle App (which is a piece of unmitigated bloatware)! ***SPECIAL NOTE: See below for the fix for Kindle Bloat on the Samsung Galaxy Tab!*** So:The Good: larger screen; nice layout; fast enough to run the kindle App (bloatware that it has become); lots of space (64gb selected); good price; more to come, I'm sure. ...The Bad: no GOOGLE Play Store - I have a bunch of paid4apps to reload the hard way; A bit choppy when scrolling; Not the easiest interface to live with after 2+ years with ANDROID 2.2 on 3 other machines. I do miss the freedom of a cleaner ANDROID interface, then again, it's a KINDLE, not an ANDROID!The OK: Special Offers (non Special Offers version was not available with the 20% discount, 64 GB, and 8.9) aren't much of a problem. The splash screen has a rotating offer & there's also a(n almost) hidden Special Offers Tab. This is not as much an annoyance as I expected & just maybe I'll hit something that I'll buy; Speed is good, but not great. Expected as this is an incremental upgrade & not the HDX. Price/Performance tradeoff applies here. ...The Frustrating: It doesn't fit in my custom 7\" bag from Eddie Bauer ($5.00 from the local Thrift Shop), but that's my problem as I selected the 8.9 vs. the 7; The HD & HDX don't have the sound out port next to the mini-HDMI port like the original Kindle Fire (Grace Digital docking system frustration).OK. All things considered, a great machine at a great price. I'm in the process of dumping my bloatware Kindle App from my Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0. .......One other note: I have had my Kindle Keyboard since it first came out. I'm not abandoning it for the simple reason that I can read it in bright daylight outside. This is one limitation of the Color machines. That and battery life. So, I trade off as the day develops.(300+ books and counting. Alternate free book sources include ManyBooks_dot_net & Gutenberg_dot_org).-----Additions after a week of use:1) My case (from eBay as I didn't like the Amazon cases) has 3 small magnets in it. This means that it activates the Kindle HD's magic (magnetic) auto-off switch when I close the cover. This is a nice feature; however, it is quite annoying when I am reading with several interruptions. Example: loading 22 DVDs into a Kubuntu (Linux-based) system required interruptions in my reading every several minutes as I had to swap DVDs. Closing the cover (to protect the screen) as I placed the Kindle down meant that I had to re-login to continue reading. An annoyance! Furthermore, I am unable to find anywhere where I can explicitly turn this truly annoying feature off! I'd prefer the option to manually switch the unit off, or let it time out (currently set at 30 minutes).2) It is a bit klutzy to adjust screen brightness when reading a book. This used to be in the aaAA section on the older B&W; kindles & in the Kindle App for Android. Sadly, not in the Kindle Fire HD! Thus one step has morphed to three steps. Gaaaaa!3) Bloatware. I purchased this unit because it was capable of operating the latest Kindle App at a reasonable speed. The Kindle App for Android has bloated to the point that it is almost completely useless on my Samsung Galaxy Tab (P100) unit. The real crime here is that I can't back-load to an earlier version that actually works on the P100! Shame on you Amazon!4) SP Offers. After a week, I know that my next Kindle will definitely *not* have special offers. They aren't that ugly, just persistently annoying over time. I do like the (almost hidden) Special Offers tab on the top selection bar, but the continuous cycling of offers does become tiresome as I use the machine. Oh well, I'd have paid for the no special offers option, if I had known, but it wasn't available in the features that I wanted on the refurbished model. Live & learn.5) Wireless: I have the 4G LTE version w/ATT. ... No choice here when I purchased the Kindle, except that I'd have preferred the Verizon version. I have had lousy reception with ATT over the years, so I'll take this one with a grain of salt. I haven't turned this feature on & have it in reserve, so we'll see in the next few years if ATT has improved their coverage. PS. ATT coverage in my home sucks rocks. The only way to call by cell phone is to have a WI-FI connection to a router & a cable modem! //This is mostly as my home is in a geographic shadow for the local ATT & T-Mobile cell towers. When I had an ATT cell phone, I had to go outside and stand in my front yard (in winter) to actually complete a cell phone call (not fun at 30 below in Minnesota)! WI-FI call switching has saved me from many potential frostbite episodes over the years.//And, after 2 weeks, some insights:1) If I get tired of the ads, then I have the option to pay an additional $15 & Amazon will shut off the special offers. I am considering this, but have not yet made a decision.2) After I got everything up & running on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9, I decided that it was time to work on my Samsung Galaxy Tab. I saved off all of my critical data. Then I performed a *HARD* reset & wiped the tablet clean! This erased all existing memory & all downloaded apps on the tablet, then reloaded the built-in apps from the ROM memory. !!! And a miracle occurred! !!! The pig of a Kindle App with all of it's bloatware was blasted into never-never land and the pre-loaded Kindle App from ROM was re-installed! The older app works like a champ! It has revitalized my Galaxy Tab as a 7\" eReader! So, absolutely, positively, no Kindle upgrades ever again on the Galaxy Tab. Why replace a GREYHOUND with a PIG when you don't need to!Now I have both a working 7\" Kindle eReader & an 8.9\" Kindle eReader!More to come. ....", "Date": "October 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Glitches", "Author": "Jacquio", "ReviewID": "RBU9B9XRAXVAI", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "While I loved my original Kindle Fire, I am not crazy about this one.

Now that I have received it and used it for a few weeks I am very happy with it. I couldn't believe how cool it was the day it arrived. I spent hours and hours with it for a whole week! I couldn't put it down. I still use it daily and would feel lost without it. The screen resolution is fantastic. It's fast over wi-fi (I didn't opt for the 4G but I'm sure that's great as well), and has lots of great apps, with more being added all the time. I have Hulu+, Netflix and Spotify on it but with Amazon Prime alone, I can watch thousands of video movies and tv shows. With an added HDMI mini cable you can connect it to your digital tv and watch videos from amazon or the other apps on your tv! I highly recommend the kindle fire hd if you have amazon prime or are considering getting it. I have used prime for years to get free shipping on prime eligible items of which I can almost always find. I use it a lot for reading magazines and it saves trees. Also books. I have had kindles since the 1st generation ereader and have a lot of books from those previous purchases. The only negative remark I have is that the speakers were not as great as I expected. The newer model might be better for that feature. I really don't know. I would recommend buying the fast charger adapter.

If a few unimaginable, disappointing problems hadn't reared their ugly head just recently I'd give the Kindle a 5-star rating, unfortunately for now, kindle is just mediocre. ;/Let's start it this way... until yesterday I WANTED to <3 the Kindle. I've gotten 3, the Kindle, Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and Kindle Fire HD 7.I was sharing my son's Kindle for reading books until I got my Kindle this month (I have the 7\" Kindle Fire HD) I ignored some of the \"glitches\" thinking I'd take the time to straighten things out once I had my personal Kindle...well no such luck.1) There is no way to keep content from anyone you share an account with, be it a spouse, parent or child. Meaning my horror books are visible to my son, no matter what I do, unless I want to delete my purchased content. I personally like to read and reread books, now I'm forced to waste money and get rid of a book...bummer!! Luckily my son is not a kid to open something that's not his BUT some of the title pages are scary for a young child, so I'm left with only one option. Don't buy, or buy and delete, which still makes the cover photo available while I'm reading the book.2) There is an app for monitoring your children's Kindle activity (Kindle Freetime) but it's a pay for app and the ONLY way to keep adult content, inappropriate content from a child's view. Disappointing! I should be able to block material. This could be a solution to above complaint.3) There is no way to organize your books and apps. For someone who has purchased dozens and dozens of books in 8 months, this is a real pain in the bottom. Considering it's actually available on the earlier and less expensive versions...why leave that option off the Kindle Fire HD? Again, this could be an easy solution to the above frustrating complaints.These are enough for me to be disappointed with the Kindle. I'm considering returning the 2 most recent purchases, and no longer purchasing Kindle eBooks, so that I don't risk my son being exposed to books I'd rather he not see.BTW before anyone comments back the books I'm personally discussing are true crime, mystery, suspense books, nothing crazy, no smut, no triple x, I just don't want my son seeing the cover to Black Dahlia or the likes. My son won't be looking for them but he simply can't AVOID seeing them as they are listed in the cloud ;/There should be a way to organize or remove books from view.Darn Kindle I wanted so badly to like you.

This is my third Kindle.  The only reason I bought this latest one is that my first generation Kindle Fire stopped charging (after only having it for 1 year 4 months).  Amazon customer service told me that these units are well known for this issue.When ordering this (via a customer service rep on the phone), I said I wanted a KF without the \"special offers\".  He said they didn't have any available (?), but I could simply pay $15 to have the ads removed via their website.  Interestingly enough, it arrived WITHOUT the special offers, and it didn't cost me a dime.  Way to go, Amazon!I love the larger screen... the clarity is amazing.  And I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the sound - I don't need to use headphones any more when watching a movie.  I sometimes even have to turn the volume DOWN, it's that good.I don't have the same problem I've seen other reviewers mention... the lagging internet speed.  Mind seems to go lickety split with no trouble.  And yes, the power off/on button at the top is sometimes difficult to find, but I don't think that's anything worth complaining about.The only negative I have (so far) is the battery.  It takes F-O-R-E-V-E-R to recharge it... whether I use the USB cable that came with the unit (and their PowerFast for Accelerated Charging plug), or another similar cable.  My previous KF used to charge in 2-3 hours... now, it often takes 10+ hours to get it charged enough to use it without being attached to a cable.  Seems a tad long, in my humble estimation.The charge also doesn't last very long... I can have the thing fully charged (100%), and it goes down to 25% VERY rapidly - even if all I'm doing is reading a book.  I HATE that.All-in-all, I am reasonably happy with the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" unit.  Would I have been AS happy to stick with my first generation Kindle (if it hadn't stopped charging)?  You bet.  Would I have preferred to replace my non-charging first generation Kindle with a plain ol' Kindle Fire Tablet 7\" LCD Display, Wi-Fi, 8GB and save $25.00??  Yup, I probably would have been just as happy with that.

It is fairly fast and it works great for school and scheduling. I recommend it to anyone. However, there are a few issues. 1. My email says it is \"checking email\" but won't upload any new messages I have received, so I have to use my laptop (started happening 3-4 days after use). 2. There was one random time with the screen's pixels went all different colors and I managed to fix that (happened on the 4th day and hasn't happened since).Wishlist for the Kindle1. Outside camera, not just the camera for skyping facing the user.2. More customizationOther than that, if you have any second thoughts buying this product, I highly recommend it and even though there are a few kinks still, the quality of the product is very high.UPDATEAfter posting my review, a couple hours later my email began working again!UPDATEThe email has ceased working once again, a few hours after it began working. Also, sometimes letters need a firm press to work.Wishlist: once you hit \"space\" after using the symbols keyboard, I wish the keyboard would return to the letter keyboard.It still works great and am happy to have it.UPDATEEmail is working again and has been working for the past week. I really enjoy using my Kindle Fire HD and it has replaced my iPod.However, the office app that is pre-downloaded onto the KF is terrible. Only some of the PDF files will actually open and the ones that don't, there's an option to \"send error\" and I do that. I received an email this morning with one solution, upgrade the office program. I went to do that and the app COSTS $15!!! So, if your Kindle is going to be used for business, you may want to look at other tablets.UPDATEThe \"on\" button at the top of the device is not working anymore. There is plenty of battery left in the device, as I charged it last night. It will only give me the Kindle Fire start-up screen then go black...UPDATEMy kindle works, however, the \"sleep\" button will only turn the device off, even if I just tap the button. Other than that it is working just fine.", "Date": "August 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love it", "Author": "Sam", "ReviewID": "R24D18XVR6TLIR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's late so I'm going to try and keep this really brief.CONS:  Bad buttons. There is only one huge con to note. The buttons are tiny and they fit into the sides of the kindle in a way that make it really hard to press them. If you buy this, make sure you get a case that can take advantage of the open/close wake/sleep feature.  No back camera. I don't really care about this, but I know this will likely be an issue for some.PROS:  Perfect size. It doesn't feel like an oversized phone, and it doesn't feel like I'm carrying around a giant cutting board. I like the 8.9 size better than any other tablet I've used.  Battery life. The battery life is great. It's kind of necessary since its main purpose is for reading books, but still, it's worth noting.  Lightweight. It's weight is almost perfect. Light enough that you'll never tire of holding it, while heavy enough that it has substance while you're holding it and using it. It doesn't get uncomfortable, and you won't ever thing about the weight. Definitely a good thing.  Simple interface. The interface is extremely accessible and intuitive at all times. It's simple and doesn't have the usual \"dominoes on a table\" style interface I've come to hate so much. This is definitely a more personal and subjective pro, but I thought I'd mention it. Just remember that the interface may be a con for some people.  Fast wifi. What can I say? The wifi works well. If I'm not mistaken, it has some of the best wifi technology available at the moment.  Front camera. The front camera is good for Skype. Means I can do video calls when I'm on vacation/not at home. Don't really know what else you'd use it for though.  Auto adjust brightness. This is old news, but I find that my kindle's auto adjust seems to work better than my phone's. (Samsung galaxy s2) This is probably more my phone's than the kindle. The point is if you're not trying to conserve battery, just use the auto. It works well.  Swype. I haven't really kept up with Apple recently, but last I heard, android was the only thing with Swype. Definitely a pro. I wouldn't even think of buying a tablet without it. I'm writing this review on my kindle. It would have taken 10x as long without Swype or a keyboard. That's just what Swype does, allows you to keep your wpm up while freeing you from keyboards. This allows you the freedom a tablet should have. In fact, that's kind of the whole point of tablets. Besides, Bluetooth keyboard are mini sized so your wpm is going to suffer in whatever keyboard size you start using less. Again, not sure, but if the iPad doesn't have Swype, then I'd buy this over that regardless of anything else.  Kindle perks. Kindles get some special perks if your an Amazon prime member. You can borrow one free book a month. It's a bit underwhelming, but free is free and pros are pros.  Amazon integration. This will be a huge con for some and a huge pro for others. I use Amazon for a ton of stuff so I enjoy it. if you have Amazon prime, then you'll also get a seamless integration of Amazon instant video. The kindle also syncs with all of your Amazon cloud data. This makes it really easy to keep up with everything on multiple devices.OVERALL: I think it's pretty clear how I feel about the kindle fire HD 8.9. It's a great tablet for a great price. It's probably worth a lot more to anyone with an Amazon prime account. I'm sure there are a ton of pros that I forgot, and at least a few more cons I haven't really thought of yet, but suffice it to say that I'm very happy with my purchase.", "Date": "August 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Adequate but lacking.", "Author": "Kyle D Esala", "ReviewID": "R144B2NKRB6R0U", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Web browsing is an extreme pain on this device.

I must say, it is not an issue, and would not be worth the money to get the No-Ad version. The ads are more of a screensaver, with a touch and slide to the right to open the ad. To get to my Kindle content there is a touch and slide to the left to open the Kindle. Now either way, you have to touch and slide. To me, the ad version is not annoying at all and I simply view it as a screensaver. So save your money and don't pay for the ad removal.UPDATE 10/9/13: I have had no issues with my KF HD and it continues to perform well. I take it everywhere with me. I also just learned that the KF charger does a fine job of charging my smartphone Droid4, so no switching of chargers in home or car YAY!!.

I have not formally reviewed that Kindle, but so far, it has worked fine and my son is in charge of the usage of my 8 yr old GD. She LOVES reading on the Kindle Fire. DS is using Parental Controls and states it works well. He can completely block the internet, limit the game time, and no limit on reading time. So GD is happy she gets some games with lots of reading.UPDATE 2/7/14 No issues. Works like new. GKs Kindle Fire HD 8.9 has no issues either.

I tried to talk my husband into buying a Kindle instead of the Sony Book Reader but he let someone he worked with influence him because they had one, and mostly because at the time the first Kindle had the little buttons for the keyboard and he didn't like the look of that as it was distracting and he liked the concept of just swiping your finger across the screen to turn the pages (on the Sony), which was not available on the first or second generation kindles.Now he uses his Fire HD all the time, sometimes even in the morning to read the newspaper instead of booting up his laptop (again a Sony Vaio which he's even more disappointed in).

It's not obtrusive due to the size of the screen.  It might be less awesome on the smaller version, though.Better speakers (it still sounds better with headphones, but the speakers are usable if, for example, your cat chewed through ANOTHER headphone cord and left the pieces on your pillow, as a gift).CONS:Power button hard to see/find and it doesn't have a light (so unless you actually open up the case, you can't make sure that it's actually plugged in.  See prior note about cat and delicious, delicious cords).A little heavy for holding in one hand, especially in a case.Still more glare than I would like...not impossible to use in daylight, but not great.Battery life is longer?  AHAHAHAHAHA.  Surprisingly, movies/tv seem to suck the least juice. Reading eats the battery, and playing games (like Angry Birds and Cubistry) kills it.Formatting issues with some books and games.Generally, I am very pleased with it.  I find that I watch a lot more movies & tv shows because of the larger screen.  Also, I can set the text size a little bigger and not have to turn pages as often...as I am rapidly approaching the Age of Reading Glasses, I like this feature. I just wish the power button had a light like the 1st gen. Fire, and that it was slightly raised and not flush with the case.

I'm very impressed with this little machine. I've had an iPad2 since release day and use it daily. I had no need for anything else, but decided to purchase the Fire to use mainly as a digital wifi picture frame. Now that it's here I have a feeling I'll be putting my Kindle Keyboard away and using this for my main reading device... especially since I now know how to get whispersync working on non-Amazon, non-DRM books and documents via Amazon's cloud, between all my devices using the Kindle apps.So why do I like this? For one is the price... I got it for $250 which is a fair price point for this device. I don't think I'd love it as much at $299 and would probably have bought an iPad mini at that point. Needless to say, I'm glad I didn't.The screen is gorgeous! I don't have a retina iPad so I'm comparing it to my iPad2 and Macbook Pro. I love it.The build is substantial. It feels like a quality product... not a cheap tablet... and it looks beautiful.The packaging is very Apple-like. Simple and sleek. Felt very nice to open and reveal the toy inside.The Amazon integration is wonderful. If you have Prime this is a no-brainer.What I don't like... it has a bit of a lag and feels slower than my iPad. Not quite as responsive, but not bad enough to make the device seem unusable.I also don't like the location of the charging port. Being on the long-side of the device made it a little tricky to find a stand that would accommodate the longish stem on the included USB cable when docking horizontally. I was able to get around this by finding a micro-usb cable with a very tiny head so there's a bit more clearance between the KF and the table when set in a generic tablet stand. I'd be much happier if the charging port was on the short-side of the device. Charging while watching a movie, or in my case using as a photo frame, is sometimes a necessity.So far those are the only cons I've discovered with this little tablet. I've only had it for about 3 days so that may change, but I all-in-all I'm quite impressed... and that's saying something as I'm quite an Apple fan girl and never expected to own any tablet other than an iPad.I would recommend the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 to anyone considering a tablet on a budget... especially if you are a Prime member. The integration is wonderful and the ease of use is nothing to sneeze at.

Unless money is not a constraint, you can save over $250 by purchasing the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" instead of the iPad 4.DESIGN:Although the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" is cheap, the chassis feels solid. It's not the aluminum build that you'll find on an iPad, but it's well-constructed nonetheless. The Volume and On/Off buttons are not as flush with the body as they are on the 7'' version.PERFORMANCE:The iPad 4 and Nexus 10 offer smoother performance, better processors, and a better web browsing experience. The Kindle can't compete in these categories. Nevertheless, the Kindle Fire HD has a very responsive interface in its own right. Do not expect glitch-ridden, shoddy performance simply because of the low price.SCREEN AND SPEAKERS:Picture quality on the screen is sharp, clear, and vivacious. It is a joy to read or watch anything on the Kindle Fire HD. Amazon fused the touch sensor with the LCD display to reduce screen glare. This is crucial for people who like to use their tablets outdoors or in well-lit conditions.Most tablets use a single speaker to simulate stereo sound. The Kindle Fire HD actually uses two speakers that are visible externally. The result is that the sound produced by the Kindle Fire HD is incomparable among tablets.PORTS:I was able to connect the Kindle to my projector via the micro-HDMI port, and the results were outstanding: 110 inches of HD content on my living room wall, originating from my Kindle Fire!FINAL WORD:The Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" is an amazing tablet at a very affordable price. The tablet boasts a mesmerizing IPS display, booming sound, and incredible battery life. Sure, the Nexus 10 ($399) and the iPad 4 ($499) have better processors and higher resolution screens, but they also cost significantly more. If you sign up for an Amazon Student account, you can buy the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" for $249 today!For a more detailed review, please check the comments below.", "Date": "January 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "After Santa delivered this, my son has not played with his other Christmas toys!", "Author": "Michael D.

And yes, I wish it had voice recognition, but when I want to ramble on in an email I am going to use my Laptop.  But other than that, it does everything I want -- the price point was wonderful, I can easily find the on off button, I don't mind tapping twice if I have to --- it is easy to use, intuitive and fun.  I would have bought it sooner, but I had to think about what I could use it for.  Did I really need it?  I have 2 laptops, an Ipod, an ITouch.  I needed a reader but wanted something that had more functionality.  I had looked at my friend's IPads and thought they were too big and too much money.  I had seen the smaller Fire's and thought I would like something bigger.  So, I finally decided to go for this -- and I have found many uses for it. It really makes my life easier.

I am a guitar player, so I can plug my Kindle Fire HD into my PA, fire up YOUZEEK and jam along with my favorite artists while I watch the video (if youtube has the video).

I went to a nearby store to test the actual product, and walked out shortly after that with a Kindle Fire HD 8.9, and immediately fell in love. I have an Asus Transformer Prime rooted and ROM'ed, but the kids don't do so well with it's large size. My three year old gets especially frustrated trying to play a game on the Asus. I got the KFHD set up with FreeTime, and he went to town with it, no frustration.The screen is worlds better, although it's over an inch smaller diagonally. Still not as bright as the iPad mini, but pound for pound, on par with the best displays on the market today.I opted to buy the 32GB WiFi only tablet, and the price was hard to beat for the included hardware. I was a little sad to see a lack of SDHC expansion, as my Asus has over 40GB full already.Battery life so far is great. Out of the box it went over six hours of continuous use before it needed charged up. I charged it overnight, and have not put it down in the last 8 hours. I watched a full movie, set up some new apps, played Angry Birds, and the processor got quite warm. It currently is holding a 40% charge. Not bad.The WiFi speeds coupled with the powerful dual core CPU clocked at 1.5ghz make for a super responsive and smooth experience during use.I was able to use WiFi hotspot on my Sprint phone to allow the KFHD 8.9 an internet connection while in the car last night, and I must say, it works so much better than the Asus ever does. I suspect the KFHD Dual Band Dual Antenna may be the difference.I was also ecstatic to learn that students get an Amazon Prime membership for only $39 PER YEAR. And with all the features that come with Prime membership, this is one of the best deals.The only disappointments I have are the lack of Google Play Store, and that the non-slip back will not allow my company's vinyl sticker to adhere. The volume of apps available from Amazon makes up for the first, and finding a case or cover will solve the latter.Bottom Line: Great product. It is not an iPad or true Android, but in many ways it is better. And I walked out of the store only having spent $400.

Young \"youngka\"", "ReviewID": "R2Y1JSRJ1BYYM1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My summary is that I'm very satisfied with the product, though it's not perfect.DISLIKES:It really comes down to media/content management as the biggest downer, and this is something that Amazon did on purpose.  So, yes, there is definite intent on Amazon's part to create an imperfect device.The first content managment issues is GAMES.  The Kindle has this wonderful menu bar on the top that separates Games, Apps, Videos, etc.  And, as long as you acquire your media from Amazon, it places the media in the proper location.  If, however, you're inclined to upload your own media, the Kindle will not allow you sort into the proper location.For example, I already own the Angry Birds Star Wars game.  I'm not going to buy it again, just because I've changed devices (just like I wouldn't re-purchase a song just because I upgraded an iPod).  Fortunately, it's easy to migrate media through a process called \"Sideloading.\"  You tell the device through an easy setting that it should allow installations from non-Amazon sources.  Voila!  You can bring in those games.Unfortunately, since the game didn't originate from the Amazon store, it won't be recognized as a \"Game.\"  It just goes into the generic \"Apps\" menu.  So, I end up with only half of my games in the \"GAMES\" menu, rendering it useless.  I only use the \"APPS\" menu which has all of my games, but also all of my non-Game apps.  Irritating not to be able to use the full menu structure.The lack of recognizing VIDEOS is also irritating.  Again, if you purchase a movie from Amazon, it will show up nicely in the VIDEOS menu.  If you rip a DVD and put it on your device, it will not show up.  You'll have to use a file explorer app like ES Explorer to find and open the video.  Same with home movies, so this isn't a copyright integrity issue ... it's purely a decision to cripple the device when working with non-Amazon-originating material.  Anything that did not originate from the Amazon store will be dead to the Kindle and you'll have to find a back door to locate and view it.Frustrating not to be able to go into the VIDEOS menu and look at my son's pee wee football highlights.  Nope, got to go through an explorer menu tree to do that.CAROUSEL is also annoying.  Anytime you use anything, it goes into the carousel.  Delete it from the carousel.  Use that app again and it's back there.  Just adds a bunch of clutter.  There is a separate Favorites function, but it would be nice if the carousel were a bit smarter.  In its current incarnation, it's just useless clutter.The included Cloud storage is useless, excepting the music portion (250 free song storage/stream).  Not only does it not allow anything to be streamed, but it won't even allow you to access files you store there.  Just a pointless mess.  This has been discussed ad nauseum, so I won't repeat.  Dropbox, Box, and countless other online cloud storages are much better and have good apps to use.So, the biggest disappointment is clearly the media management of this device.  Amazon intentionally crippled the device and made any non-Amazon media use/visualization very cumbersome.LIKES:Video is amazing.  Read the other reviews, but it is crisp.  1080p source material is just awesome.Sound is also crisp.  Watched the opening sequence to Expendables 2 in 1080p Blu-Ray transfer as my test for video and sound.  Wow.  As mentioned, the video was insane.  The audio was wide and expansive.  Really nice simulated surround treatment.File manipulation is easy. Things like YouTube, which are \"missing\" from the Amazon app store, are easily sideloaded onto the Kindle.  Putting files onto the Kindle is easy.  Using them and Kindle's native management of those files is crap, as mentioned above.Responsive touch pad.  Check out YouTube vids from back in Sept 2012, when the 8.9 Kindle Fire HD was being demoed at various shows and events.  The touch pad looked pretty clunky in those reviews -- unresponsive, unreliable.  Ouch.  Made me nervous.  Whatever those bugs were in those prototype units were apparently solved prior to shipment.Great linkage to Prime for streaming content.  Surely, it would be nicer to get more movies from this century (most are from the 80s and 90s), but there are some good titles in the mix (Thor, Transformers, Rango, e.g.).  Still don't know why it costs 5.99 for a physical DVD to be shipped to my house, e.g., but to buy an electronic-only version of the same movie costs 9.99.  I hate to be gouged, and so I haven't bought a title, yet.  Rentals at 3.99 for most newer stuff is still expensive enough to keep me a RedBox customer ... much better than the DirecTV 5.99+.Ads.  Yes, I like the ads.  I like them, because it lowers the cost.  I can choose to pay more to remove the ads, but I don't.  I love the idea of being able to choose a lower price.  People who hate the ads can choose to pay more to remove them.  What a great system!  How could you ever complain about that?  (this refers to the lock-screen ad.  The \"what others bought\" ads that appear below the carousel can be turned off without cost.)It's a great tablet.  I would buy again.  Amazon already figured this, which is why I expect they're fine intentionally crippling various aspects of media management.", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Well Designed Jewel", "Author": "F.

I've owned an iPad 1 since it launched, and while I love it, it's recently slowed down and isn't compatible with iOS 6.  So, I had been considering moving on to a more current tablet.  The newest iPad was an obvious choice, but when I considered what I primarily used the iPad for - reading books and comics, surfing the internet while on the couch, watching video - I realized that I didn't necessarily NEED to live within Apple's ecosystem.  Sure, they offer a ton more apps, but I don't use enough of them to justify another $500 purchase.So, I looked to either the Nexus 10 or Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  Ultimately, I chose the Kindle Fire HD because of its integration with the Amazon store.  I'm already a Prime member, I have a vast library of Kindle books, and I use they're Cloud music player because it works with just about any device I'd want.I'm glad I went with the Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  It's a good, not great, device.  When I first received it, and put it through its paces, I was a little disappointed.  It doesn't run as smooth as the iPad, and again, few apps are as polished.  And then there's Silk... the world's worst browser.  It's slow, clunky, and doesn't do anything better than any other browser out there.  Fortunately, the more time I spent with the Kindle Fire HD, the more I learned about it and came to enjoy it.When you get past the fact that it's not the iPad, you can appreciate the Kindle Fire HD for what it is - an amazing e-reader that also happens to be an adequate tablet.  Seriously, this is the best Kindle experience you'll find.  Books are baked seamlessly into the OS, the Kindle UI is excellent, X-Ray is cool, and the text to speech feature works amazingly well.  Not the Audible option, mind you, but the standard text to speech option available on any book.Besides book integration, the Kindle Fire excels at delivering all Amazon content, which should be obvious.  Movies are quick to load, music stored in the Cloud work perfectly, and photos are easily synced with your Facebook account.  Again, it's just a darn good personal tablet.  The fact that it's $200 less than an entry level iPad shouldn't be ignored either.Outside of seamless access to Amazon content, the best reason to own a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 is its beautiful screen.  As someone who owned an iPad before it had a retina screen, I can tell you the difference is staggering.  Everything is clear and crisp.  Reading is enjoyable, and movies have excellent black levels.  For an avid comic reader like myself, the Kindle Fire HD is a godsend.  Even though the size of the screen is slightly smaller than that of an actual comic book, everything is perfectly legible because of the high resolution.In short, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  It's not an iPad, but really, you shouldn't have expected it to be.  It's a great reader (books and comics) and video player, and has an adequate number of tablet apps.  Is the lack of specialty apps worth the $200 savings?  I'd say so.  Especially if you're already knee deep in the Amazon ecosystem.  If you're a Prime member, and also use the Cloud Music Match service, it's close to a must buy.", "Date": "December 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" Review", "Author": "Margie Burns", "ReviewID": "R3JYDUBADVCA5C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am very happy with the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\", but I had a hard time operating it at first, have gotten better but just wish that there were better instructions on line.

Maybe because I took time to figure it out and had no preconceived notions or expectations? I don't know.Short versioin: Do I like it? Yes! Could I live without it? Yes. Are there things I would change? Of course. But I like it! :DLong version:-Physical features. Heavier than I expected, but manageable. Occasionally I turn it off without meaning to, usually when I'm trying to adjust the volume and hit power instead. I wish the power button lit up when plugged in to let you know if it was fully charged or charging. Its kind of wierd that the speakers are on the back of the device; the sound can either be amplified or dampened depending on where and how you have it sitting. It does not come with a charger, only a USB cord, which I think is stupid, but since I already had one from my Kindle 3G it wasnt as big a deal as it would have been. It does charge a little slower than I expected, and the battery only lasts about 8-10 hours, less if you're playing a game.-Readablilty. I like that I can adjust the screen brightness for interior light. BUT the screen glares horribly outside, even in the shade. If I know I'm going to be outside, I take my Kindle 3G instead. Otherwise, I have no problems.-Ease of use. I don't know how other tablets are set up, since this is my first, but I find it fairly easy. The carousel holds all of the content you have accessed recently so you can scroll through and find what you want. There are also tabs at the top marked games, books, apps, etc so that you can search by media type. There is a search bar above that, but I haven't used it at all so can't say whether or not it's good. When away from the home page, a bar at the bottom offers home, back, search, and favorite buttons. You drag down the top bar for settings, which is where you go for parental controls, applications, security, etc. Books in the carousel tell you the percentage you've read at the top corner, but I do wish I could sort my books into \"read\", \"new\", etc, like the regular Kindles. Overall, I think it's pretty simple.-Preloaded content. The HD comes preloaded with a few things I find helpful, such as Skype, Facebook, Pandora, and an email management program that allows me access to multiple email accounts from one location, which I really like. It also comes with Kindle Free Time (which my kids are mostly too old for), OfficeSuite (which I'm still trying to figure out if I even need) and IMDB (which for me is a waste of space). You cannot remove these from the device. Why must this stuff take up space if I am not going to use it, EVER? They are not necessary, so why are they there? That's that much more space I could have for books! But then again, they only bug me when I notice them, which is not very often.-Silk browser/WiFi. I had a bit of trouble connecting to the internet at first, but a 15-20 minute phone conversation with tech support got the problem (my router, not the Kindle) sorted out. I have taken my Kindle all over and had no problems with the WiFi anywhere that has a signal, even a low one. Even out in the boonies. Silk browser works fine for me, have no problems with speed unless my internet service is being wonky. It comes with Bing.com as the default search engine, but you can change this in the settings. Absolutely love that I can use it for recipes without having to drag the laptop to my tiny kitchen!-Movie/sound quality. I have only watched YouTube and FB videos so far, so no movie opinions yet. YT and FB seem to be fine, relative to the quality uploaded to the site. Sound is better than my laptop, not as good as my iPod. Again, wierd that the speakers are on the bottom.-Camera. I dislike that the camera only faces one way. To take pics of something other than yourself, you have to turn it and look at a wierd angle. Pic quality was not great, either, but that might have been operator error.-Shopping. The Fire HD has two quick-links to Amazon shopping; the \"Shop\" tab at the top, and the \"Shop Amazon\" widget in the carousel. My biggest complaint is that when shopping for books and apps the page is a little hard to navigate. In all fairness, I'm comparing the \"computer store\" to the \"tablet store\", but it seems that some categories available on the computer are not available on the tablet. I can still find what I'm looking for, but it takes longer, especially if just browsing.-The ads. A lot of people have a problem with the preloaded ads on the Kindle. If an ad doesn't interest me, I don't pay it any attention, just like tv. The recommendations at the bottom of the carousel also don't bother me, and if they do, I can turn it off. If you think they will bother you, then either get the more expensive one with no preloaded ads, or pay the $15 or whatever to have them removed.", "Date": "August 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love the larger tablet size", "Author": "Joan M Robbins", "ReviewID": "R2Q1REFL1NQSTB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My previous Kindle Fire was stolen so when I went to replace it, I once again went with the Kindle.I like the video capability and with the larger screen it's even easier.any apps are great.As always, reading on my Kindle and with Amazon Prime I have so many options, is so much easier than carrying books aroundIf only I could take it in the tub with me, I'd be a truly happy camper.", "Date": "June 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Made her day", "Author": "Glenn Whitworth", "ReviewID": "R2KHHNZ7TADSTG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Her old Kindle HD 7\" would not charge any more.

I LOVE my kindle fire!!! I'm a student and having access to course websites or reference pages has been absolutely invaluable when I'm on campus but even my netbook tended to weigh down by backpack with everything else I have to carry on a regular basis so this was the perfect solution. It has all the functions I seek in a netbook but at a much better weight.True it's only 16 gb of memory but for me that wasn't an issue. I have an iPod for music so I didn't need to clog this up with downloadable music, though it is possible to use this for such. I mostly use my kindle for documents, internet access, games, and Netflix.Touch ScreenThe screen has always been very responsive, never had any issues with it.DocumentsThe document system is a little different at first because you have to email things to your kindle account but it's very easy once you figure it out and the things you've sent arrive quickly! Just remember to add your email to the safe list on Amazon so it knows to receive.InternetI've never had much trouble with the internet myself. One page I routinely visit doesn't work properly on the Kindle but that same site also doesn't work when I try to access it from a smart phone. There have been times when the silk network has had to restart usually because too many tabs are open and the system is a little overloaded, my fault.AppsThere are tons of apps, and plenty are free so there's no shortage of stuff to amuse you when you have some downtime. Lots of games and it does work with Netflix if you have a internet connection.I've used Netflix a few times and its streams absolutely beautifully on the Kindle Fire. Amazing HD quality and the audio is great too.Special OffersThese are not intrusive to your Kindles functions. I have them on this Kindle as well as an older kindle with a keyboard and they have never been a bother. They just pop up on the standby screen and go away once you unlock.ReadingI personally do not use this Kindle for reading too often because I prefer the graphite e-ink of the older models myself but I have used it for some textbook use and its been a wonder compared to lugging around the large books.CameraI rarely use the camera, this is probably the one thing that has been the least impressive about the Kindle Fire. The camera's quality is not great it seems almost as if the camera was an afterthought on the system. Added because people can use things such as Skype but certainly not made for major usage.MiscThe box comes with a basic computer USB charger. If you have a cell phone or MP3 player that uses a USB optional wall charger then this will plug in and you can charge it through a wall as well. If not you will need a computer to charge the kindle and it is a low power charger so if you're actively using the kindle at the time it will remain alive but not charge. The wall chargers I've used seem to charge the system MUCH faster than when I leave it hooked to my computer off.There is no screen protector or case that comes with the basic purchase so if you're concerned for the safety of your Kindle definitely consider ordering those as well.", "Date": "May 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "By far the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 Tablet is the best Android Tablet on the market", "Author": "Tablet Seeker", "ReviewID": "R3835AFY7A4RTW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been very pleased with the quality and speed of the new Kindle Fire HD.

The WiFi connection at home (and everywhere else) constantly needs the password reentered; not only does it do this when I shut off the machine and restart it, it does it all by itself as I am using it!  I also was hoping I would be able to read my magazines on it--on the small Fire I cannot read most magazines because the magazine appears to control the size of the print, and it remains too small for me. On the large Fire, I can read the magazines, but again, they often don't increase in size as much as I would like them to, the way the books and pdf files do. Can't Amazon do something to correct this problem? I have not bought the Fire, small or large, for several older relatives because of this very problem.  In addition, the speed of the unit on the web is disappointing. I use a laptop as well, and the same WiFi connection is speedy on that, but arduous on Kindle Fire 8.9\".

I was okay with that, the main reason that I bought it was for reading technical software books that lose a lot if the code samples are not shown in color and on a larger screen. I still planned on reading my normal books (Physics and Sci-Fi/Fantasy - Yes I am a geek) on my Kindle Touch.The Kindle Fire works great for the purpose and my software books are wonderful to read in full color.The second reason that I purchased it was for the Amazon prime integration. I have prime and the lure of having the tablet play the free movies helped me go this route instead of a regular Android tablet with the Kindle App. Actually I was at first impressed with the quality of this and so were my coworkers. The trivia app is actually cool, but then I began to realize the only time I sit down and watch movies is when I am flying and have really never played with it again. I also found that there is an Android Prime application for the PS3 and so this feature became unimportant real quick. Still a beautiful feature if you are going to use it.So finally, why did I rate it as a mediocre product? Simple, as noted in the previous comments, I am a tech geek and a software developer. I don't think that the interface is bad for the basic user who is not someone like me where I take every device I have and make a workflow that works for me. However this device has no way to do this.An example: My Android Phone. On my phone I lay out my pages by how I use them such as a section for the calendar and a section for games. This is actually similar to the way the Kindle lays out its own pages. The difference is the \"home\" page. On the Kindle it is a non-useful scrolling of the applications in the order of last use. On my phone, the first thing that greats me is the weather for the day (as I am also a runner/biker/dog walker) and then my work email, personal email. On the Fire, I cannot display the weather but I can get an App for it, go to the apps page, and then load it and then it will be added to the list on the front page in front of my work email. Basically there is no way for the Kindle Fire to greet me with the information I require on first use. So I cannot use it for my daily needs, it becomes a reader.Even the pages that are like my normal workflow have no customization that I can easily find. In the apps, the order on the page is whatever the device decides so finding the weather app is not as easy as if I could put it at the top of the list.The final lack of customization is that you can view photos but you cannot change the screensavers. Okay I am being very picky but customization of the screen saver makes me feel like I own the product and makes the product easy to identify from others. Lay my Fire down with 10 others and I would not be able to identify it quickly at all without buying add ons.In the end I use this as an E-reader for texts that require color for more understanding. I use it maybe once a week since I busy with other work right now. Compare that to my phone which is almost hourly and my Kindle touch which I use to read at home to unwind daily, and this purchase may have not been the best for me. Perhaps a different customizable tablet with the E-Reader app would have been better.However for the general user that doesn't want to bother with the advanced features, I would probably have rated it at a four or a little higher but it just does not meet my life's workflow.", "Date": "April 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Buyers Remorse", "Author": "dave", "ReviewID": "R19J1EU68PE987", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Overall it's good product, but I should have completed a little more research on the availability of certain apps I expected to be available on the Kindle.

I don't know the details of why Amazon does this (probably to tether all customers to Amazon), but they have an Amazon special Economist program that cost about $10 a month.  Not a bad price for the magazine, but you have to pay for it even if you have a hard copy subscription.  For the extra cost you would be better off buying an iPad.  A little more expensive, but they have free Economist App for subscribers.

First, I am NOT paid my Amazon nor am I compensated by them in any way, nor do I know anyone who works for the company, okay? The product is outstanding for what it is ... it is a media consumption device. This is NOT a tablet. If that is what you want, then go buy an IPAD. For those of you who dislike this product because it is not an IPAD, well, guess what? This is NOT an IPAD. If you want to watch video, play games, and read ... this product will do all of things and do them well enough to stand on it's own feet (forgive the anthropomorphism). Okay, let me dispel a couple of those wrong reviews: 1) You cannot use the device and charge it at the same time. Um ... yes, yes you can. I do it all of the time as do my sons, who both have 7\" devices. 2) The speakers do not work well. Really? I'm a little hard of hearing and I have no problem. 3) It takes hours upon hours to charge the devices. Mine all charge in pretty short order I think. Speaking of charging ... it is true ... the Kindle Fire HD does NOT come with a wall charger (REALLY Amazon? No charger???). 4) The quality of the device leaves much to be desired. Really? I have three and each one performs top notch. 5) Amazon's Customer Service is horrible. Yeah, I know this has nothing to do with the device, but I have called these poor people several times since buying the Kindles and each time they have been great, not to mention patient. I figured I HAD to rate them somewhere. Okay, anyway, so much for not being wordy, right? Look, the device does what it is designed to do well. Very well. Would I buy another? In a minute. So why four stars and not five? The power and volume buttons leave a little to be desired. I like that they are almost flush because they do not stand out too much.

This device gets far better wifi reception than any other device that I own, including my laptop, smart phone, and Nook. At even this distance from the router, Netflix streaming is seamless, with no buffering at all. Web surfing, downloading apps etc. are also relatively quick. When I am closer to the router, speed is lightning fast. Graphics are very nice as well. I'm very happy with this purchase. About the only thing that I don't like is that every app that I use is automatically added to an onscreen carousel.

There may be a way in settings to disable this feature, but if so, I haven't found it yet. I do like the favorites feature which is easy to use.

This is written for people like me: your first tablet was the original Kindle Fire, and you are trying to decide if you should upgrade to the HD and, if so, whether you should go for the 7\" or 8.9\"  model.  I assume that you are familiar with the technical specifications (from Amazon, Amazon customers, or other review sites).This is a long review so here's the get-to-the chase summation:1. One cannot comfortably hold a tablet this size in one hand.  This will be obvious to anybody who has a large tablet but for newbies, or those used to a 7\" model, the difference is much greater than one might have expected.2. If you decided to get a second Fire rather than one of the alternatives because you figure all your content will be there and you won't have to learn anything new, you will be disappointed.  Anything with a userid/password must be set up again (which would be true if you switched to a different vendor).  Only Amazon content is saved to its cloud.  So if you have books you downloaded from other sites, or applications you have side-loaded, you will have to do that by hand (also true if you change vendors, except you will have to recreate everything). And applications that ran fine on the original Fire may not run at all on the HD.  Also, there are enough differences between the interface on the HD and the original Fire that I think the learning curve is probably just as great as if, say, you switched to a Nexus.3. UPDATED:I thought the original Fire was the deal to end all deals.  It has its limitations but, for the price, I don't think there is a better bargain on the market.  The new HD models are another matter.  These cost \"real\" money, and I can't unequivocally recommend this tablet. But, I want to be clear here, this is not to say that the HD is a bad device.  It is, simply, that while I could excuse Amazon's pitiful App Store, and UI issues, for a device that cost me $200, I am not willing to excuse those deficiencies for a device that cost me $450 (plus tax).Background:The original Kindle Fire was my first tablet, and I was satisfied with it, in spite of some shortcomings, from Day 1.  I have rarely, if ever gotten so much bang for the buck with a tech purchase.  During election season, I and the Fire rarely parted company.So, why did I buy the HD 8.9 WiFi tablet?  Three reasons: First, although I've been very happy with the Fire, I've run out of application space (something that truly surprised me) and have been shuffling apps in and off the device.  And tablet technology generally has improved in the past year.So, why didn't I just get the 7\" HD?  Because, second, after listening to iPad users assert for months (until the mini came out of course) that 7\" tablets weren't \"real\" tablets, I wanted to try out a larger tablet.Third, I wanted to see if magazines, like The New Yorker, and web pages, would look better on a larger tablet. And it seemed to me to make sense to stick with Amazon on the theory that the learning curve would be short.Initial Reactions:After adding in the $15 to get rid of the ads and the $20 for the AC adapter, we're talking $400. Add in $55 for the Amazon cover, and we're up to $450. (See my review for the cover; I am not happy with it.)Is it fair to include these extra costs?  Yes.  According to Amazon, if you charge this tablet via your computer's USB, it will take 14 hours.  Right, 14 hrs.  The \"fast\" charger does the job in 5 hrs. (about half the battery life, 10 hrs., cited by Amazon.) But Amazon considers the \"fast\" charger to be an optional accessory?  It was excluded from the base price for the same reason that Amazon charges extra to get rid of the ads: to hit the price point it wanted to hit.  The AC adapter should have been part of the price.  As for the ads, I think Amazon should have offered the ads as a way to reduce the price rather than the other way round.UPDATE:I have had the 8.9\" for 7 days now and I may update these remarks, but, in general, although I am not as disappointed as I was at the end of the first day, I am still not thrilled.  As I said before, my threshold for satisfaction re a $450+ device is higher than for a $199 device and perhaps it was too much to expect that I would love the 2nd generation product as much as the 1st generation product.Size:iPad owners are nuts.  A tablet this size is no doubt better for watching videos than a 7\" tablet.  But it is only marginally better at displaying web pages. (I'll get to magazines in a moment.).  It feels heavier than the original Fire, but the main problem is simply the size, at least for somebody my size.  It is, quite simply, too big to hold comfortably with one hand, and if one needs two hands, well, then one has to make some kind of adjustment.  NOTE: I am not blaming Amazon.  I obviously knew I was getting a large tablet and bought a large tablet on purpose.  If you have a 7\" tablet and are thinking of getting a larger size, I can't emphasize enough that the experience of holding a large tablet is very different from that of holding a smaller tablet. So think about how you use your tablet.  To read books, surf the web, watch videos?UPDATE:  With both Fires next to me (the original 7 inch and the new 8.9 inch) which one do I automatically reach for?  The 7 inch. It is simply way more comfortable to hold in one hand.  And I can throw it in a backpack or messenger bag to take with me.  If I keep the 8.9 inch, it will be for home use only.User Interface:Amazon does not make good use of the added real estate.  When you turn on the HD, you get the carousel, absent the physical representation (the icons sort of  \"float\" on the screen), on top of \"suggestions\" which change with the items on the carousel.  I found that annoying, so I turned off the \"suggestions\" in the Settings.I had assumed, naively, that with a larger screen, I would be able to see more items.  But Amazon chose to increase the size of the icons rather than use smaller ones to fit more on a screen.  This design decision exists throughout the software: books, videos, web, everything.  Amazon has simply increased the size of the icons so one doesn't get any more items per screen than on the 7\".  The ones on the carousel, on the opening screen, are HUGE. If you have vision problems, you may appreciate this decision, but I wish Amazon would offer a resize option. UPDATE:  Under Bookmarks (Web section), you get 3 screens of 3 broad icons showing the top of your web pages.  On the original Fire,  you get 12 thumbnails showing about \u00be of the web page (bottom row shows about \u00bd of the web page).Amazon has also introduced a number of changes in the UI, from how to get to the settings, to the way you get to the home button, to the options in Silk - well, I could go on, but if your primary reason for buying a new model Fire is because you assume it will be easier than learning the interface for a different vendor's product - you are in for an unpleasant surprise.  Yes, vendors are always changing the UI, but I have yet to find a change that makes using the HD easier than using the original. So for me, so far, the changes come under the \"why on earth did the vendor do this?\" category.The most annoying change for me is the list of options at the top of the first screen.  They are, in order, Shop, Games, Apps, Books, Music, Videos, Newsstand, Audiobooks, Web, Photos, Docs.  Notice what the first is? Shop. And if you want to get to the Web, you have to swipe left because the first page display ends at Newsstand.  Yes, you can use the carousel or favorites to get where you want faster, but Amazon, please, pretty please, let us organize the sequence to match how we use the HD.UPDATE: The touch screen on the original Fire has always seemed to me to be way too sensitive.  Stuff launches, scrolls, etc. when I've barely breathed on an item.  The touch screen on the HD seems much less sensitive.  Sometimes I have to press quite hard for an action to occur.  No happy middle, I guess.Externalities:Others have mentioned that it is hard find and distinguish between the external volume and on/off button.  They are different sizes, however, so I think most people will get \"trained\" to recognize which is which.  Still I suspect we will always find ourselves running our fingers from the edge in because there is no way to \"see\" either button.  And since it is awfully easy to accidentally turn off the HD while you are feeling along the edge for the volume button, if you are right-handed and go in from that edge, it is probably wise to teach yourself to move in from the left edge for volume, right edge to turn off.  UPDATE: I am no longer accidentally turning the HD off, but I do still need to \"search\" carefully with my fingers to find the right button.There is no charging light (red/green), so the only way you know for sure that it is charging, or to see if it has finished charging, is to turn the Fire on, pull down to get the options, select more, choose device, get battery usage. Or get a battery monitor and make it a favorite.  This is just foolish beyond words.The USB and HDMI connectors are now in the middle of the long edge.  UPDATE: This was not a good idea.  First: you cannot reorient some games (this includes Angry Birds) in landscape mode.  And the position they like is the one with the USB connector on the bottom.  So you cannot play one of these games and recharge the HD at the same time.  I tried a video and it did re-orient itself properly but in Amazon's cover, the HD still can't be used while charging because of the way Amazon designed the \"stand\" part of the cover.  Also, I find it disconcerting to have the USB cable right where my hand is (vertical orientation, either side) when I am using the HD while it is charging.  With the original, which I always use \"upside down\", the cable is at the top so it doesn't matter whether the electrical outlet is to my left or right.  With the HD, it does matter.BooksThere is STILL no way to organize your books into genres.  You can only sort by name, title or most recent.  No doubt Amazon wants people who read a lot to spend $250 for the latest Paperwhite Kindle.  That's the only excuse I can think of for treating reading on the Fires differently than reading on the non-Fires.UPDATE: With Amazon's cover/stand, there is no way that I can find for charging the HD while reading if you want the book propped horizontally so you ccn read while lying on your side. (The cable gets squished.) And reading is also just far more comfortable with the 7 inch, which is pretty much the size of a largish paperback.Applications - UPDATED Nov. 25.A couple of the applications I depend on, like Dropbox and GoToApp (which I think is essential for anybody who has more than a dozen or so applications), did not work on the day I got the HD.  I was able to sideload Dropbox and SugarSync, which I prefer, is in the App Store. The paid version of GoToApp now works on the HD and I have bought it.  There are still other applications that don't work, but they matter much less to me.  Your experience may be better or worse.None of the Angry Birds games I bought (the original, Rio or Seasons) will run on the HD.  They do not even show up in the \"cloud' when viewed from the HD.  In a way, this is irrelevant since Amazon doesn't save your games to the cloud.  So, even if you could downlad them, you'd have to start all over.  But it is still irritating to find out that games I paid for, and bought from Amazon, will not run on the HD.  (I have applications designed for Windows 95 that run under Windows 7 without change.)I haven't yet tried all my apps. To get them to your new device, you must download each and every one which, given the number of apps, and the speed of your WiFi/ISP connection, may take a while. And all of those downloads turn up on the carousel so then you will waste time deleting them from the carousel. This is a minor annoyance and one for which there is no good solution, so file it under \"need to know/plan for\".I sideloaded Firefox 14 but it simply crashes.  I have been able to install Dolphin and Opera but not Maxthon.  Why another browser?  Because Silk not only has its old flaws (like the lack of folders) but has a somewhat different interface.  And those bookmarks and history you've got?  Forget them.  There is no way to transfer either to a new Fire or to keep two Fires in sync.  Silk has also hung badly several times on the HD, something that rarely happened on the original.Amazon has created 3 sections for its Web access: Starter, Bookmarks and History.  You cannot set it so that, for example, Bookmarks or History is the first section.  Starter is the new screen that always pops up first if you're not going direct to a web page from the carousel.  And what does Starter consist of? 3 \"shelves\":  Most Visited, Trending Now, Selected Sites.  Because the icons on the shelves are HUGE, you can see only 2 \u00bd.  Yes, that's right, in vertical mode you get to see 2 1/2 items (5 \u00bd in landscape mode).  There appears to be no way to set, for example, Bookmarks as your entry point, nor does there appear to be any way to get rid of the Trending and Selected Sites under Starter. These extra shelves may not bother you.  You may find them useful.  For me, they are a waste of screen real estate.  (And another example of Amazon's well-publicized policy of using the hardware to entice buying.)NOTE: I really, really, really do not like icons, especially very large icons,  I would much rather see just text whether I'm looking for a web site or a book or an application.  Just a simple text list that I can order the way I want. Nothing is worse than the way Amazon displays, in all versions of the Fire, videos which is, as far as I can tell, purely random.  It, quite frankly, hurts my eyes so much to keep scrolling dozens upon dozens of unorganized title icons that I usually give up after a couple of screens.  If you are looking for something specific, the search box works fine.  If you are just browsing, it's a pain.The New Yorker UPDATE Nov. 25: This was the most unpleasant surprise.  It works fine on my original Fire, contrary to the experience, I know, of many.  But I could not access it on the HD.  I suspected the problem was with the HD's autocorrect. Somebody should tell Amazon that userids and passwords often do not resemble real words.  My id and password for The New Yorker certainly do not, but Amazon's spellchecker kept \"correcting\" my entry and I wasn't even able to delete the incorrect characters.  I had to close the Sign In box and start over.  I finally got the spellchecker trained to accept my user name, but I suspect the reason that the app couldn't authorize me is that the spellchecker was somehow changing my password which consists of letters and numbers.  Finally, I went into More/Settings/Keyboard and turned off Auto-correction, Auto-capitalization, and Next word prediction.  Voila!  I was able to sign into the app.(UPDATE NOV. 26: The first New Yorker edition I downloaded, Dec. 3, was 255MB. More than twice as large as the largest edition I downloaded on the original Fire. The download for the original Fire was 165MB. I'm assuming/hoping the large size is due to the inclusion of an opera video clip.)NEW & UPDATED Nov. 26: KeyboardIf you are having any kind of trouble typing, I recommend that you try the same thing. \"Next word prediction\" seems to be particularly perverse.  For example, I wanted to type \"A link\" in Plume (Twitter client) and could not type the \"l\".  Literally, could. not. type. the \"l\". I turned off \"next word prediction\" and the problem disappeared.I don't know what kind of dictionary Amazon uses, but even with the original Fire, I have found that the words it knows are occasionally more obscure than the words it doesn't know, and that it seems deficient with respect to internet and other acronyms.The keyboard on the 8.9 HD is, of course, larger.  But there have ALSO been changes in the format.  The <-X (backspace) key now reads \"Delete\".  If you press and hold down the \",kb icon\" key, the keyboard will split in two, which may be useful in landscape mode.  Press and hold again and the full keyboard will appear.  There are a number of other differences which, for the most part, I like but it does make typing a bit confusing since I use both tables (original and HD).Conclusion: UPDATED Nov. 25, 2012.Will I keep the 8.9\" HD?  Yes, but I am still extremely ambivalent about it.  (In contrast, I liked the original Fire from the first day; within a week, it had become part of my life.) I have asked myself what I would do if I returned the HD.  Would I try the 7\" HD? Or, say, the Nexus 7\". I have part of the answer to that: I would not look for another large tablet.  The larger size is definitely better for watching videos, but I don't watch enough videos to make it worth the price. If I did, the larger size in addition to the improved video and sound quality would probably count more for me.Bezos emphasized the importance he placed on pricing a full-sized tablet right: the best features for the right amount of money.  It is time that he paid attention to the App Store which continues to be in a very, very distant 3rd place to Apple and Google, the need for synchronization (on demand) of bookmarks and browser history for people with multiple Fires, and ways for users to personalize/change the way the UI works.Musings which may not interest you:In short, I recommended the original Fire without hesitation to anybody who had never before used a tablet.  I stand by that recommendation.  But we are now into Generation 2 Amazon.  Our standards should be higher because the price is.  Assuming the only difference between the 7\" HD and 8.5\" HD is the size, would I recommend the 7\"?  Probably, if it is somebody's first tablet and that person is an Amazon customer.  But otherwise, well, the playing field is more level now.  I'm not an Apple fan, to say the least, and don't want to be part of its ecosphere. But I'm beginning to think that, at these higher prices, Amazon's ecosphere imposes too many limits on the user so the tradeoff between price and functionality is much more complex. Especially for a second tablet.My original Fire works fine.  It's only real problem is the lack of application space, but I can get around that by keeping only the most important apps on the 7 inch, and running the others (the ones that work) on the HD.Finally, I've decided to postpone until next year any decision about getting a second 7 inch.  But I will not automatically choose a Fire.  This time I will take a good hard look at the 32 GB Nexus 7 inch.Bottom Line:If you take one thing away from this review, it should probably be the fact that the 8.9 HD has not convinced me to get a 7 inch Fire HD should I want upgraded features in a smaller package.", "Date": "November 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Open it to more Android Apps", "Author": "Douglas D Snyder", "ReviewID": "R3TRIMR2OL1D0K", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "great for video and music, good for reading, disappointing for web browsing and email.Biggest problem is the unavailability of so many popular, useful Android apps.Silk is a big let down.

You can even put in a password so no one else can use it.  You can hook up to libraries, music, games, and there are lots of sites for downloading free books. Amazon Prime lets you read one new book a month.  My only complaint is the way the charge port is made.  According to the Geek squad at Best Buy, the charge port isn't braced like those in a tablet or laptop so it cannot move, and the contact points are easily broken just by plugging it into the charger.  They said the charge port is the main reason people bring them kindles, and it's not something they can fix..  I would advise getting an extended warranty if you buy one.  If yours is one with an easily broken charge port, and you have an extended warranty, Amazon will replace it.  Right now I'm on my 3rd Kindle Fire, because of that charge port.  And if the charger goes out, you can't get any personal information, like credit card numbers and passwords, etc,. off the Kindle before it is sent off to somewhere to be repaired and sold again.  If the maker put something around that charge port so it couldn't wiggle and break, I would have no complaint at all but they would probably charge more for it then.  Also, the last charge cord sent with my Kindle is impossible to get in the Kindle without maybe breaking that fragile charge port inside the Kindle, so I don't use it.

Unfortunately I am terribly disappointed in Amazon. First time EVER! I love Amazon normally. When I received my Kindle for Christmas I was thrilled but almost immediately discovered it would not hold a charge. In about an hour and a half it would be totally depleted of energy. The Amazon employee I spoke to on the phone was great. He told me to send it back and they would immediately send out a new one. (And he offered to email me a shipping label. I explained that my printer was broken, so he said to pay the shipping myself, and Amazon would quickly reimburse me.) Sounded like a plan. I took my defective Kindle to Fed Ex. had them professionally pad and pack it for me, and shipped it to reach it's destination within four days. That was on February 25th. This is March 31. I still have not heard back from Amazon. The four day shipping, with packaging and insurance cost me $75.04.(I was shocked myself, but fortunately I have the receipt.) The final blow is that my new Kindle does not stay charged any better than the first one. BUMMER! Hate to complain, but you asked- so I have to be honest.Now, I would give the features, and the Kindle's ease of use, 5 stars. (Also love the leather case that allows it to stand on it's own, and having Prime.) Even the customer service dept. that answers questions regarding setup, wi-fi, etc. is excellent.

With less than 1gb of ram available total, there often is less than ~200 mb of memory for apps like silk (the web browser) to use. This makes browsing websites with graphics very painful, and in my case, it often freezes the tablet where I'll have to do a hard reboot (holding the power button down until the tablet turns off).Games that fully utilize the resolution of the tablet will also often play at unpleasing speeds. That being said, games like angry birds, cut the rope, or candy crush will do just fine.Ultimately the tablet suffers because of how beautiful the screen is.

I purchased my first Kindle Fire HD after trying out a friend's Kindle. I checked the local stores' prices, but I got a much better price by calling the Amazon Kindle-Sales Representative. He was able to get me a better Kindle model for less than the local stores' prices. He also found the magnetic RooCase cover which I wanted; you can turn on your Kindle just by flipping the cover open! He found me a basic-priced stylus, a protective film-cover for the screen, and he told me to try out my Kindle for 2 weeks before buying the separate Damage Warrenty. He gave me the Damage Co's. phone number, and I later did have them start the Damage Warrenty after I decided to keep my new Kindle. I had a good friend come over to help me connect my new WiFi device and get my new Kindle registered. Now, I thought I had purchased the same size Kindle as she had, but it turned out that I had gotten the larger 8.9 model. I had gotten the sizes mixed-up after handling store models without covers. My friend was impressed that I got my larger Kindle 8.9 model and all its items for just $50.00 more than her 7\" Kindle HD alone had cost her at a local store. She was impressed.  I will add that having the Kindle Support phone number is great!  Any time I had a question, a quick phone call to a service rep solved the issue.  I am also glad to say that Amazon stands behind its own Manufacturer's Warrenty, too! We live in a rural area and when my Kindle 8.9 was having issues in January-February of 2013 receiving emails, one of the service supervisors reviewed my Kindle's history. She learned that I used my Kindle every day for several hours due to personal disability issues that make traveling difficult. So my Kindle was one of my main methods of entertainment and of emailing friends & family.  She saw the Kindle's email delivery problem reoccured over and over after several service reps had tried to restore that app on my Kindle. She said she felt my Kindle needed to be returnef to Amazon. However, she said not to worry at all as they were sending me a new Kindle to replace my original one as mine was still under full warranty for one more month. So, within two days, my new replacement Kindle arrived. A great service rep walked me through the steps of 'moving' all my items from my first Kindle into my second Kindle. We had put my RooCase cover onto the new Kindle at her suggestion so that I could tell the two Kindles apart as we had to have both devices sitting side by side to complete the transfers of my apps, past book & movie purchases, etc. Finally, we had the new Kindle registered and running well...my older Kindle was completely back to \"factory settings\". It had nothing of mine left on it at all, which is how she said a Kindle needs to be when it's returned. She actually thanked me for being so patient and following all her instructions! I felt She was the one who had done a wonderful job in walking an older lady through all those steps! My new Kindle works very well with no problems at all. So, I  would recommend getting your Kindle and any parts from the Amazon Store. They do stand behind their products! -- Sue", "Date": "March 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Terrible Wifi in this model", "Author": "John Kiblin \"(Laura)\"", "ReviewID": "R16FZ6Y4BUOYNG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I, and many others if you google the problem, have a serious issue with the wifi.

My first Kindle lasted several months, everything was fine. I could play games, read all sorts of books and use the web browser. Then suddenly my Kindle started locking up and freezing or just restarting itself. After resetting it to factory default (and having to start over on everything that wasn't on the Cloud, which is quite a bit) It continued to lock up and freeze. Amazon customer service was great and quickly replaced the Kindle. The next Kindle that came was dirty and had obviously signs of pre-use. The battery would only last a couple hours and all apps and books would lock the Kindle up constantly. As long as I restarted the Kindle 4 to 5 times a day and cleared the cache on all apps and web browser several times a day it was somewhat useable.  Back to customer service, restore defaults, hard reset the Kindle, turn the screen brightness down, turn the volume down and the battery still only lasted a couple hours and I still wasn't able to read books on the device. Insert Kindle number 3... Again Kindle number 3 had some sort of grease marks on the back and finger prints on the screen when it came out of the box. The power button only worked half the time and something wasn't working properly with the WIFI..... Kindle number 4 locked up upon the initial setup and got stuck in reboot mode until the battery died. Now Kindle number 4 cannot do anything with Silk without it restarting the device. Some apps work, most do not and reading books is very laggy (it could take several seconds after you turn a book page for the device to catch up).Meanwhile customer service tells me they just don't understand, that these are fantastic devices and should be able to run anything I want to do with them. I just want to read a book or play Tetris without the device freezing and restarting on me.

I did have a little trouble setting up wifi but that was due to my router settings. Stays connected well and speed is very good. My daughter is 8 and can operate very easy in the apps and online.Screen 10/10Screen clarity is great and resolution is perfect for this size unit. Colors are sharp and vibrant. have watched videos with no lag. Have not had any eye strain even after times of long use.Web 8/10Web surfing is easy but you will need to install flash player to make videos work correctly. I recommend trying several different web browser till you find the one you enjoy. I mostly use silk.Apps 9/10I find that most apps that you can find and love on your cell phone you can find on your kindle. Just check out whats available in the store and most apps are free. If this will be for a child I recommend putting a password on any purchases. I have had a coworker who's daughter ran up $100 in charges in a game buying coins before realized what she did. Password will prevent unauthorized charges to your card.I would also recommend buying a kindle charger, case and most important protective screen cover. This will prevent scratches on the screen and makes easy to clean.

I bought one with more power after reading the reviews, so I do have a hotter charger, ($10 on Amazon) but I also found that it wasn't necessary. Just use your cell phone charger. So it takes an extra hour or two, so what? The charging icon is not automatically displayed. Go to settings and turn it on, or you can't tell its charging. (its also a very tiny icon, put on your reading glasses to verify that its charging!!)The unique part I mention is that it does not have the standard desk top format we are used to looking at. It does not display a desk top which you put icons or short cuts on in the traditional sense. It has a completely different way of showing them which for me and my wife took a while to get accustomed to.

I use mine for internet and games only, I never read on it. It is certainly much better than the original Kindle Fire, that thing was crap. It crashed repeatedly and sometimes would not even turn on. I went through four of them because the one I first got as a birthday gift, the charging port went bad on it. The second one was a free replacement because it was under warranty (Thank you Amazon) and it lasted about a month and the screen permanently froze and would not unfreeze. Sent it back and got another replacement, this time when it arrived the screen was broken and cracked on the inside. Sent it back again and again got another replacement. That one lasted until I got this one, when I got this one, the other one went in the trash. Highly recommend this one over the original because it is faster and does not crash as often as the other one. Not to mention that the screen is much bigger and can actually touch something without touching two things at once, and has stunning display. Ok so there is one problem that occurs sometimes; the keyboard will freeze and slowly start catching up with what I typed and will stay that way until the next day.

Plus you can even take pictures. No, it is not perfectly perfect but whenever you have a problem, chat is the best option and it is available 24/7... So get your kindle now!!! Yes, it does have a few flaws. For example, the camera isn't the best but you don't need to walk around Paris holding up a big tablet taking pictures,,, buy a camera!!! And yes it does take a while to charge. But just buy a power charger for $20 or less or what I do is let it just sit overnight and let it charge. Because your not going to use it 24/7 so just let it charge overnight and it will last the whole day I promise you (just turn off wifi when you don't use it and turn your brightness down)!!! Also there isn't a crazy selection for apps, but what is cool is the fact that you can get apps to enhance your kindle and you don't even have to spend money!!! Just use your 500 coins... that is what I do!!! So get GSam Battery pack that is really cool to add a neat icon and get a volume control app to add a volume bar to your kindle so you don't even have to swipe down to turn down your volume, just turn it down or up from the icon button. The volume control app is free... so buy it no to enhance your kindle. Plus, you can get an app that lets you add a background... YES IT'S HERE!!!

There are some great apps sure, and most of the time you can get what you need, but even when there is a Kindle version of an app from a company, it often has less features than the equivalent Android market app. Don't expect these apps to \"catch-up\" and start appearing either. It will always be an investment for developers to support another platform so the apps will ALWAYS be behind the main Android market. A couple of favorite news apps that I use on my phone (and was really looking forward to enjoying full screen) lack features and the \"magic\" of the tablet just feels gone to me. The most important move for Amazon right now is to open up the rest of the Android app store, even if native Kindle apps are given preferential listing. Not even an official YouTube app? Cmon. (You can, however use YouTube through the browser)When it comes to web browsing and communication, voice search on my Android phone is amazing. I can send Skype messages to friends or quickly get browsing results just by talking. Not so with the Kindle, and its a huge usability difference. The native browser also has a lack of settings that will be missed by geeks such as myself.The Kindle is not without it's pluses. It has good battery life, and the native user interface is good and so are some of the native Amazon apps. Books are great to read on it, and browsing is generally good.Amazon is really trying to create it's own world here with the Kindle, and they've bit off way more than they can chew. I understand limiting access to certain apps like the music store, since Amazon is pricing these devices lower and hoping to make up the money in store, but they've gone too far and the customers are really negatively impacted by it. Amazon gets to have its apps in the iPhone and Android markets, but not vice versa.

Perfect-sized tablet! Learning tool & Entertainment in one :)", "Author": "Heathwright", "ReviewID": "R2S6X8XXFK98EC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my 2nd Kindle Fire. My 1st one arrived on 10/15/13 and immediately had issues of randomly freezing for a few seconds, then automatically restarting itself (happen 10 minutes after taking out of package, brand new). Contacted Amazon support and after attempting a reboot/hard restart and factory reset, it was determined to be an internal issue with the Kindle -- lucky Amazon replaced it that day, and I received my 2nd one on 10/17/13.  No issues with this one at all! (I think the first one was a dud.)I have an iPAD that I use on a daily basis--but I bought a Kindle Fire for my son. I bought this as a LEARNING TOOL for my child (a 3 yr old, don't bother bashing me!) & as an entertainment tablet for our on-the-go trips and occasional playtime. I love the fact that I can place a time limit on his FreeTime profile and block internet/web connections, downloads/purchases, and his access to other apps. I use apps (ABC/123/shapes) that allow him to \"connect the dots\" by counting, have him write the letters/numbers, and place the shape in the correct spots. I can set a password for the tablet (to prevent him from using it without my knowledge), and I can set a password that has to be entered before he can exit a game/app/movie (especially for the movie part!).The KindleFire is a perfect tablet for entertaining a child during a car ride/airplane trips or when you are at an appointment that your child wants attention \"right now\" while you're trying to talk to the doctor -- my son watches his kid shows & movies, and he \"reads books\" (the Kindle actually reads to him!).  I love the feature of the Kindle reading books to him, as I can't do that while driving.  There are a few games he plays (puzzles, counting, and such) to keep his mind active and to help him learn abstract thinking.I don't really use the Kindle much myself, aside from helping my son with his puzzles and counting/shapes.  I have browsed the internet a few times, not bad at all. I enjoy having this tablet for my son & very happy I bought it! It is a great tablet that can be used for books, apps, and internet. No complaints with this one so far!*** & Just for clarification: I do not use this as an alternative to teaching/playing with my child, nor do I use it as a distraction tool for keeping my son entertained so that I don't have to.  I've seen several comments (here and other links) of people assuming and bashing the buyer for allowing their child to use tablets--MODERATION is key, and monitoring and locking the tablet work just as good to control the amount of time/usage my son has with this. So before you start bashing people, shut up & read the comments! Don't tell me how to raise my child--you don't want me tell you either!  :)", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "BETTER THAN FIRST KINDLE I OWNED.", "Author": "JULIA C.

I've had this for a few months now and have tried to test everything to make sure I give it a fair review. Let me start off by saying that I also own an ipad. My reasoning for stating that I have an ipad is because I can't help but compare them to each other. I with start with the dual antenna, which supposedly makes your connection better and stronger, I have found this to not be the case. I have the 50 meg service through Time Warner Cable and when I am streaming video it constantly hangs up and spins while it waits to buffer more video, never had this problem with my ipad. Picture, I will say that the shows I have watched are pretty awesome, blows my ipad out of the water, rich deep colors that let you see every detail. Sound, the sound is good but since they put the speakers facing backwards, the sound is going away from you and that takes away from the quality in my opinion. Touch screen, this is my biggest problem, I would say 85% of the time, I have to touch something at least 3 times to get it to work and that causes A LOT of frustration for me. Overall user friendliness, I would give it 2.5 stars and I think this rating has a lot to do with me owning an ipad and how user friendly that is.

I can play games with it and tuck it safely away in my carrying case. What I DO NOT like is that I have had to have it replaced 3 times. THREE times. I had problems with it starting on month 5. It went hot for a while, I learned to use the reset button from the kind folks at the help center and all was well for about 3 more weeks. Then? Then it went black screen and would not move on from there. After doing everything a good owner should do. I was told it was probably a gonner, and was sent a replacement. A great side note is this. I am a 60 year old woman that uses her Kindle only when I go to bed for reading, a few games perhaps, and maybe once a month part of a movie. It has a protective case and even if it DID fall from bed, which it has never done, I also have the suggested protective case. I happily opened my replacement kindle. I was thrilled. For about 5 days. Then the sound stopped. Now I don't ALWAYS need the sound, but occasionally I like to have the Bible read to me! This was no longer an option. So I again called the help center, I jumped through the hoops, and there you have it. Replacement came in the mail...nice and prompt as before. Loving the fact that I once again had a \"working\" Kindle, I turned it on, listened to the sound, and was content. That is until 3 days later........I was going to use my headphones to listen to my movie. CRACKEL.... then nothing. I thought it must of course be my headphones. SO, I quickly grabbed my husbands set.  the help desk. However this time....lets see how I should put this.... Nothing. You have GOT to be kidding me!!!! I did the turn off, reset, which I KNEW would do nothing...and it didn't. BACK on the phone with the help desk. Let me see. How can I be nice? I asked the attendant if these were replacements that I was getting. She assured me that the HAD left the center in PERFECT order. I suggested that since this was going to be my FOURTH Kindle in 8 months, perhaps the refurbish center wasn't doing a quality control check. She said that EVERY kindle that left there was touched by HUMAN hands and it WAS prefect when it was sent. I wondered at this point if she was calling me a deceptive client. Having had issues twice with the sound, and once with it just signing off forever.....giving me the reluctant benefit of the doubt, she was not what you would call gracious about it, but she said she would have a replacement sent out. How can a 60 year old woman who rarely leaves the house for ANY reason, lives in the forest, has no youngsters ever touch this thing, and only uses it on a highly soft mattress, have ever damaged this wondrous thing. I did receive my replacement. I did again open the box with some sort of glee. I again put the damaged kindle in its little coffin for return. I again walked solemnly to my bed chamber. And with some sort of obtained enthusiasm looked forward to my reading and small game time before slumber. And what happened just LAST evening? The sound once again left me. No sound....and with some sort of \"autopilot\", I jumped through the hoops, fidgeted with the volume control, and tried another set of headphones. What now you might ask? I can honestly say......I have NO IDEA. I am not really looking forward to the banter on the help line, nor am I looking forward to being shamed of eluded to as some sort of perky youth that has Frisbee play with this object. I would ask for a NEW kindle, but I fear that is not an option. I do not read lips for the Netflix, I kind of like the Bible being read to me.....(Old Testament kind of blurs and I lose focus)....I like hearing the sound of the fake slots on Slotmania.  So......maybe I will have another cup of coffee and mull over my options.....................", "Date": "September 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good tablet for the price", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R31S3YWRRRL00N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let me qualify this review by stating that I have a Nexus 10 and this was bought for my wife.  For the price, it has most of the bells and whistles.  Great display and connectivity to kindle material.  Not as easy to use as I would like, the modified Android OS is quirky, sometimes it's hard to find the main menu from within other functions.  We own a pretty large library of books and the biggest issue is that in transferring via usb, most of them wind up in the docs folder.  I have no idea why the device moves some to docs and some to books and I can't find a workaround.  It's a problem in that indexing in the docs folder is very limited and makes it hard to find the book you want.  My really big complaint, however, is the time it takes to charge the device.  With the basic charger you will need to leave it plugged in overnight to get a full charge. With the \"optional\" higher watt charger, it still takes 6+ hours to charge.

Vooren \"velvetpaws999\"", "ReviewID": "R368DSJNRV8IO5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "OK, so I ordered not one, but two of these tablets: one for myself, one for my niece. The screen quality is great, comparable to the i-pad. Play-back sound is good enough for every-day expectations. Don't expect it to have the power of a boom box, or a full stereo equipment!I must say it is probably my own fault that I find this product lacking in a few ways: I should have read the specs more carefully.  Why did I not read them? I guess it is so much common place already to have these features even in mini-size smart devices that it never occurred to me that they are not on the Kindle!1) It sucks that this tablet cannot take videos. Photos, yes - but hardly: as long as you take them with the front camera, which admittedly is not easy, if the taker does not want to be in the picture.How much more can it cost to integrate a second camera lens, to allow photo taking? I mean, come on, Amazon, the little i-phone and other comparable tablets have it, so why not the Kindle tablet?2) This leads to point two: No video recording!!! Same as above... it should just have it! I wonder what Amazon is thinking... do they believe people will go and buy an i-pad or a Nexus on top of the Kindle Fire, in order to get these features?These two points are my biggest regrets for the Kindle Fire 8.5, and I find it truly regrettable and disappointing!Other things I wish it had: a software for note-taking and email dictation. Obviously, that goes with the above two points: if they can integrate a camera, they can integrate a software like I have on the iPhone, for instance, to use spoken dictation with the microphone.In conclusion of this, I'd call it a rather passive tablet. You can watch videos, you can see photos you took with another camera, you can play back music recorded by another device... You cannot do any of it WITH this tablet.You can surf the web and look at websites, and you can type (albeit painstakingly) your emails with it, no dictation.I guess the two most useful features I will use are the consolidated email feature, where you can see the email of any number of different accounts (yahoo, aol, gmail, you name it...) in one glance.And of course, reading books. That may be its best feature, since one has access to what... millions of them by now, and lots of them for free. Their number is increasing each day!As for the movie watching, it is OK, but I'd rather still use my laptop for this, since it can load and stream them faster than the Kindle, not to mention that I prefer a larger screen for that.I'd willingly give it 5 stars, if they will integrate the features mentioned above.Sometimes, I'm wondering what those tech designers are thinking when they put together a package.... or maybe they are not thinking much? Without those features, a user has to still have another tablet/smart phone, to do what the Kindle is lacking. Nobody wants to spend twice the money and schlepp two tablets around! What for???~!!!

It's kind of a complete joke. The battery drains within an hour or two, even when it's plugged in as you're using it. I've had several instances of plugging it in to charge via USB while I'm at work (read: not using it) only to find that it has not only not charged at all, but drained to the point of shutting off. I've also plugged it in to charge overnight in a wall outlet and woke up to find that, again, it hasn't charged but has drained and shut off. I plugged it in to a different outlet, checked it after 30 minutes or so to make sure something was happening, and then left it plugged in for another ten hours. When I checked it before bed, it was charged to 86%. That is nothing short of ridiculous, I'm sorry.I am aware of a special \"quick charge\" device that you can purchase separately to charge in under 5 hours (Wow, you're kidding! Strap in and put your helmets on kids, this is ludicrous speed! /sarcasm #Spaceballs), but I think it's absurd that you have to buy a \"special charger\" to make the thing function normally.The picture is fine, the sound is fine, the app availability is marginal, the interface is acceptable. It's hard to care about much else when you can't even use it for any reasonable length of time.In this case you get what you pay for. It was cheap, and it functions accordingly.

The number of free apps keeps expanding daily and he is always finding new \"games\" to try.The only drawback that we have found is that you apparently cannot use the Kindle Fire while it is charging.  We have not been able to get it to \"unlock\", or if unlocked when initially plugged in, cannot get it to play any apps while it is charging.  The Kindle has a 2-3 hour battery life when playing graphic intensive games and on long trips needs to be recharged.  We have yet to find a way to use it while it is charging.  The Apple iPad, which my son and daughter own, does not have this problem.  It can be played while it is charging.

I wanted to give myself time for any problems to show themselves. I can honestly say I haven't found any. I've got to say that at first I was not happy to know it came with ads, but they are really tailored to you personally and I've found several with great deals! I got a $3 coupon off on MP3's and so have purchased a couple of single songs to start off my music collection and with the new Dolby stereo they sound wonderful! I also own an older KF and the sound is a HUGE improvement in HD units. You can actually listen to books, movies, games, without any headphones/earbuds if you want. I also love the bigger screen and the quality and crispness is fantastic! I had spent time reading reviews on different devices before I threw my hint out for the KFHD and alot of them said that the quality was excellent and I must say it is!!! The HD also has Bluetooth as well for those who want to listen in private and the little unit I purchased here on Amazon was easy to pair with KFHD. I am also looking into a Bluetooth keyboard to add for ease of use as well. I absolutely love the immersion reading experience! It does actually immerse you into the story more so that just reading and is so nice whenever you need to be up moving around to listen to the story and have it pick up sound wise where you left off read wise, and vice versa. I've seen people complaining about the apps or should I say, the lack thereof, but there is a way to side load many apps. I've enjoyed the free month of prime that came with the KFHD and at $79 a year doesn't seem like a bad deal at all. There were so many movies, shows, games, and books that were free for prime members to use and enjoy that I was never bored. The KFHD may not be as high tech as other android devices on the market, but for many people this is a plus! I can see where older people and younger children would find this an easy unit to use. I enjoy mine and use it everyday. I actually don't know what I would do without it now! As I said before, the KFHD may not as high tech as some android devices, but if you are looking for a cost effective little pad with basic web, excellent sound and screen, access to Amazon with all it's books, games, and apps, wrapped up in a simple, easy to use interface, then the KFHD 8.9 is for you.", "Date": "July 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "LOVE IT!!!", "Author": "Paul Eznack", "ReviewID": "R3BQIJ9NS78LA4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really liked my wife's 7\" Kindle Fire HD, but for me, I wanted a larger screen, so I went with the 8.9\".
