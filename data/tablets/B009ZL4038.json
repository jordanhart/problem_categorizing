Does what it is supposed to do and easy to work right out of the box.  He will mainly use it for skype, netflix and basic internet surfing.

He was very happy with the gift!!!", "Date": "December 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "it is ok", "Author": "Rebecca England", "ReviewID": "R303XH1CGEEX7M", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "the touch screen does not work that well, can't get apps to download correctly, and then just barely bumped the touch screen to put it into the cover we bought and the screen cracked.  now the touch screen will not work at all.  prior to that my daughter was pleased with playing games today after we charged it as long as we had a good internet connection.  now having to get a replacement - NOTICE - touch screens are really touchy and break easily.", "Date": "May 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great table, just a little slow", "Author": "Cindy Vaughn", "ReviewID": "R15UKT9WKAJ84E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Not sure if its my internet connection, but sometimes it runs a little slow, but it does all the things I need it to do, just wish it was a little faster at times, but then again I'm a little impatient.", "Date": "May 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love it.

I think its good it does sometimes slow down but it works for what it was made, and for what my mom uses it. I would recommend this for people who aren't familiar with technology and are learning to use it. But its very good on size and like I said it works, it has Wi-Fi sometimes youtube is slow but the pictures are very clear.", "Date": "June 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best yet for my kids", "Author": "pyclan5", "ReviewID": "R3D68RCMM6C4AT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought several for my kids before Christmas and returned everyone of them except this one.

There's only a few things that i don't like. When i try to shut it down, the \"ok\" button is so hard to click. I have to try to re shut it down a few times before the button will click. It's a little slow but not bad. And worst of all-- THE GLARE! It's horrible! But maybe i'm just used to my laptop...  So overall, it's good! Especially for the money. It does what it's supposed to do. i recommend getting it though. :)", "Date": "May 5, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B009ZL4038"}}
