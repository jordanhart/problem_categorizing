{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Easily met my expectations", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3EB03U91Y3OG7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had 24 hours to play with and customize this computer.  So far it is meeting my expectations. My last computer died on Thursday.  It had a swivel screen that you could write on with a pen.  It was a good computer but finally ghosted.  After it died on Thursday I started thinking about getting a new one.  My requirements were:1. Small2. Runs Microsoft office3. Monitor out connection.4. Swivel screen5. windows 76. decent battery time.7. decent internet8. email9. Not to expensive10. Physical keyboardIronically, I was talking to my wife Thursday night (she was across the country)and telling her about my computer.  I had turned on the t.v (something I rarely do) and QVC was on.  They were advertising an earlier version of this computer for about $80 more than Amazon was asking for this computer.  I did a quick search of the QVC site, then and internet search and wound up here.  When I saw that they had a more updated version but cheaper it seemed like fate.  I could not find any reviews of this version of the computer, but the previous had plenty of reviews that were mostly positive.  since the two computers are basically the same, I decided to take the leap and am happy so far.1.  The reviews for the computer said that to get the full potential from this computer you would need to add a gig of memory and upgrade windows 7.  I played around with the computer for a couple of hours before getting the upgrades.  Definitely a noticeable difference and worth it.  The memory cost about $35 and the windows 7 upgrade was $70. Altogether it cost about$540 to get this computer up to its optimal configuration.  The only reason I did not give the computer 5 stars is because I would rather them to have put a higher price tag on the computer and send it out with 2 gigs of memory and the windows upgrade then to have to go out and waste time doing it myself.Pros:  Meets my needs.  I can type, surf the internet, take notes, read a book, use the keyboard or touchscreen.  The computer works well, is relatively cheap, and seems to be sturdy. Is responsive and the hardware requirements are up to snuff for my needs.  The touchscreen is more responsive than I thought it would be.  You have pinch to zoom capability on both the touch screen and the mouse pad.Cons:1. Needs work to get up to optimal ability.2. The keyboard is small and takes some getting use to.  The page up key is right next to the shift key.  I hit it better than 1/2 the time when I go to capitalize a letter and the cursor winds up in the line above it.  It is annoying but I am sure I will get use to it.  Also the cursor sometimes seems to have a mind of its own and I will be typing in one spot and the next thing I know I am typing somewhere else on the page.Note:  The computer would not read the extra gig of memory I put in until after Windows 7 was installed.  Just something to keep in mind.These are my first impressions.  I will post an update in a week or two after I have had a chance to use more feature and put some serious time on the computer.Overall, right now if your needs are similar to mine, I have no problem recommending this computer.", "Date": "January 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great for school", "Author": "jewelvac", "ReviewID": "R1DTLH7UYII5KS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This little netbook was exactly what I needed.  I am currently a college student studying math, and I needed something that was small and portible to help with my organization.  Little did I know that I would constantly be on this thing.  I am able to take all my notes on it, the touch screen is extremely responsive and I can clearly read my own handwriting.  One feature that I particularly like is the handwriting to mathematical formulas, so I don't have to search for specific symbols when typing up some homework.  I also really like the fact that it is small.  It fits perfectly in my backpack and I don't have to worry about it taking up too much space, unlike my 17\" laptop which is massive.  Just realize that this is a netbook, and it doesn't have the speed and capacity that a full size laptop or desktop has.  I upgraded to full windows 7 to get the access to all touchscreen options, and I also upgraded my memory as well.  I generally don't use it to watch videos or play games, just simply for homework, and to surf the internet from school, and read books off the kindle for pc or google books.", "Date": "February 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great tool for the price, minor limitations", "Author": "rugbychef", "ReviewID": "R2YJRM9EY44GM5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered the ASUS Eee PC T101MT after my big laptop video card died.  I wanted something more portable and lighter for my daily commute to the office and to take on vacations.  I also wanted a tablet since I needed to be able to enter data while working and trying to hold a traditional laptop while walking through stores updating my Excel spreadsheets was too awkward.  I looked at the current tablet offerings from Apple, Samsung, BlackBerry, and others and decided that they didn't meet business needs (I needed a business tool, not a toy).  So I looked at netbooks and only found two that offered a touchscreen, the ASUS and a Lenovo.  Amazon.com had the best price by far compared to other stores and I got the ASUS netbook with a larger hard drive for less than Office Depot!  The Eee PC tablet is fairly impressive, although it came with Win 7 starter which has only basic touch capabilities.  I upgraded to Win 7 ultimate and added Office 2010 Professional Plus and IE9.  It took a long time to install all the updates because the Atom processor is not as powerefull as the quad or dual core processors on larger laptops and I maxed out the RAM at 2G which is only adequate for Win 7.  After installing all software, the netbook ran well.  A little sluggish at times, but my goal was to load everything I might need and then start removing unnecessary software once I determined my usage habits.  The touch screen works well with both fingers and stylus.  There is an occasional delay as the processor works to respond to input (web pages loading, resizing screens, etc) but overall, it is reasonably responsive.  The hard disk is big enough to accomodate all my applications and data.  The size of the keyboard is comfortable for my average sized hands.  Having three input modes (keyboard, touchpad and touchscreen with finger or stylus) is really convenient.  the screen is a good size that makes my normal daily tasks easy and the screen is sharp and bright although I haven't tested it outdoors yet.  The overall weight of the unit is comfortable for me and the size is easy to hold.  The battery has been holding its working charge for about 6 hours without using a power saving profile.  The only feature I would like to see added to this netbook would be a bluetooth transmitter.  Since I have the touchscreen, I don't use my bluetooth mouse anymore, but being able to sync my cell phone without a cord would be convenient.  Also, the touchscreen is a think flexible plastic layer that you can feel moving when using the stylus.  Not as attractive as the gorilla glass on the Ipad, but it does allow the use of the stylus which the Ipad does not.  I've not seen any reports on the lifespan of the touchscreen, but if it lasts more than 3-4 years (especially at the low price of this netbook) then I'll be happy.  All in all, I'm very pleased with this netbook.  It's smaller and lighter than my old laptop and seems to do everthing it did just a little more sluggish.  Hey, it's an inexpensive netbook and I can live with that!", "Date": "February 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "The Questions I wanted Answered", "Author": "Justin Everett", "ReviewID": "R2X6KLQWVEB2ME", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So, I did a fair amount of research and decided to buy the Asus.  My friend had this model and wasn't happy with it, so I asked him if I could try some upgrades - before I purchase my own - a test run that is.  My 2nd choice would have been the BU-27 version of this computer, but I assumed I wanted a clean install of Windows 7 Pro 32bit, and choose my own memory upgrade - I assumed I could find better RAM than what they installed.  Usually manufacturer OEM operating systems are too loaded with bloatware, and other stuff running in the background slows down the system.  My 3rd choice would have been the the Lenovo s310-T.  But based on cost, reviews, and having a test dummy of this model from a friend, I decided to go with this computer.So here are the questions I wanted answered about the product, and I hope this helps someone make a decision:MEMORY (Upgrade a must):It was amazing how much this sped up the system.Although some sites list the memory as DDR3, that is not what the system takes.  The N455 processor is DDR3 compatible, but the 1GB installed at the factory (and hardwired to the motherboard) is DDR2.  I got lucky, and purchased the right memory here at Amazon:Corsair Memory VS1GSDS800D2 1 GB PC2-6400 800Mhz 200-pin DDR2 Laptop Memory KitYes, this is a 1GB stick, the computer takes a maximum of 2GB RAM.  This limits the system to 32bit (x86) versions of windows software.A few tips on installing the memory.  Take out the batter an unplug everything from the device.  Take out the screw on the door (3.0mm precision screwdriver works the best), with the door notch facing away from you, insert your index finger then pull up and towards you.  It will feel like you are breaking it, but you are not.  I've had the memory door off 7 or 8 times now.  The memory goes in at a weird 45 degree angle, make sure you can't see any of the gold connectors on the stick, then press it down in the bay until it clicks.  Replace the door, and screw.  Plug in the computer, and turn it on.  Start hitting the F2 Key immediately, this will get you into the BIOS.  Look to see that the Memory read 2048MB - that means the memory is properly installed.  Hit F10, hit yes on Exit and save changes.This upgrade may be enough for you.SOFTWARE:Win 7:Win 7 Starter was not designed for a tablet, you need Win 7 Home Premium 32bit or above to get the tablet functions.  Not the windows anytime upgrade from Windows Home Premium 32bit to Win Pro 32bit, also works in upgrading from this starter system to Win 7 Pro 32bit.  I tried this first, and it completely slowed down the system, and made it buggy.  It also took about 5 hours for the software after the code was entered to download from the microsoft website, then after updates, another 3.  I experienced a lot of stuttering even with the RAM upgrade.  I used Win 7 Pro, because of some of the business network virtual login options.  But for all intents and purposes, Home Premium will be just as good.  Also Cheaper - you can find it for under $90 vs. the anytime upgrade for $70-80.  It's worth the extra money to have the disk.  If you don't have an external DVD player, Microsoft has a free program that will turn a 4GB+ flash drive into an installation disk.  Go to [...].Help, scroll down and download.  It took me about 15 minutes to use the utility and put Win 7 on a flash drive.I would and did do a clean install on the stock 250GB hard drive, huge difference in performance.  However, your orientation button will stop working.  It's an easy fix, because you'll want to download some software/system upgrades from the ASUS website.Drivers & ASUS Upgrades:After trial and error, here are the ones I installed that helped performance ([...]) - select product (Eee Family), Series (Eee PC),Slect Model (Scroll down to the Bottom T101MT), when it will ask for the OD = Win 7.If I didn't list something from the ASUS download page, it is because I felt that it was worthless bloatware.BIOSI updated the BIOS to the latest version 0802.  It's pretty easy.  Download the file, rename it T101MT.rom, and copy it to a flash drive.  Plug the flash drive into your netbook, and reboot.  Immediately start hitting ALT-F2, this will start the ex flash bios update utility.  Just follow the prompts, and voila!Chipset:Download and installTouchpad:Elantech Touchpad Driver - download and installUtilities:Super Hybrid Engine - Puts a little Icon in your system tray that allows you to quickly adjust the processor from performance to powersaver.Capshook Utility - Touchscreen functionalityTouch series application - I downloaded this for 1 reason only - to get the screen orientation button to work after a Win 7 clean install.  DO NOT INSTALL the whole program, it's a waste of resources.  Unzip the file, under the TouchSuite folder, go into the 2doorway folder, and double click Asus Setup and follow the prompts.KB Filter Utility - you will need this after clean install for the orientation button to work.  also installs a lot of short cuts and hotkeys that make the touchscreen easier to navigate.SATA:AHCI Utility Driver - this basically tells the hard drive and the system to play nice.  If you are going to upgrade to an SSD, especially an Intel SSD, install this.Camera:If you want to use your camera after a clean install, install this as well.Other:Express Gate - I didn't install this, but what it is is a basic operating system that you can load at startup to do basic functions and websurfingSSD:This was the reason I wanted to test an upgrade on another (not my) computer.  There is no hard drive upgrade door on this netbook, you have to take it apart.  THIS WILL VOID YOUR WARRANTY, but I think it was an awesome upgrade.  I tried a Kingston SSD Now SNVP325 128 GBKingston SSDNow V+Series 128 GB SATA 3GB/s 2.5-Inch Solid State Drive SNVP325-S2/128GB, first.  I had problems with this drive, mine was defective and am RMAing it.  I have this exact model of kingston already installed on my media center and it has worked great for the past year. With that said, I also bought an Intel Intel X25M 120 GB Solid State Drive with Internal SATA and Power Cables MLC Flash Technology, 2.5-Inch Form Factor SSDSA2MH120G2K5.  After taking the computer apart 3 times (It's not that hard, and I learned some tricks from practicing), trying to figure out what was going on with the Kingston, I installed the intel drive, then did a clean install - CLONES SLOW DOWN THE SYSTEM, DO A CLEAN INSTALL OF WINDOWS 7.  Note, this is an intel processor based computer that runs off of AHCI, SATA is NOT an option in the bios for controlling the HD.  The Intel drive meshed perfectly, I'm getting 220MB/s Read and 90 MB/s write consistently (Close to the max specs of the drive).  Total install time for windows 7 pro 32bit, including downloading windows updates and ASUS drivers was about and hour.  It took me about 20 minutes to install the drive itself.  I'm sure Amazon will take down this post if I tell you how to take apart your computer so Google: Micro T101MT tear down.  It should be the first recommendation from google.  Read the first page, look at the pictures then read my notes on the second page, under the poster \"Amazon Followup\", YOU DO NOT NEED TO REMOVE THE MONITOR!Other notes:  Able to get close to 8 hrs with SSD with normal useage (Word processing, a movie or 2, web, etc).  System boots in somewhere between 25-30 seconds including BIOS post messages with SSD.  Handwriting and basic functionality are greatly improved, and 720p videos are smooth (I use SMplayer), but also tested in the system hogs Windows Media Center, and again seamless.", "Date": "March 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome, but had an issue  (but it was fixed)", "Author": "Douglas", "ReviewID": "R1U5JA5BPQU8EV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To anyone considering the Asus Eee Pc, I highly recommend it!The Eee Pc is an awesome little convertible laptop.

The screen is very responsive to the stylus and even very good with your finger.  The ability to switch between stylus only for resting my hand on it to take notes and stylus/finger input for scrolling and reading is awesome!

Great for checking your mail or listening to music, but videos greater than 720p on youtube will slow to crawl (not that you need 1080p on a screen with such low resolution!)The small keyboard is surprisingly usable, it doesn't feel particularly difficult to type, and this is coming from a guy with fairly large hands. Multi-touch on the trackpad is a nice feature, and you'll quickly get used to two-finger scrolling.It works great for what it's meant to do, but I would definitely recommend upgrading to a capable version of Windows or investigating your options with Linux. (Fedora and Ubuntu being the best choices, IMO)I might note that the viewing angle isn't the best, and that while you can change the orientation of the display, no way but right-side-up will ever look quite right.

However, after getting a friend to help me install the additional RAM, this lag is now gone. The RAM itself was tricky to install, and I thought it was going to break. You have to make sure you push it all the way in to where none of the gold pins at the bottom of it are showing.I'm very pleased with the chiclet keyboard as well. It is easy to clean for when it gets dirty, and is the perfect size for my hands. The keyboard itself was one of the reasons I had wanted to get an Asus.
