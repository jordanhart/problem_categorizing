It comes in weighing a little over 1lb.I upgraded from the iPad 3 and you can defiantly feel the difference. When reading with the iPad 3, after a few minutes my arms would be tired of holding the iPad up. With the new iPad Air, that is not the case anymore. I can read for much longer now and my arms don't feel tired. The unit is also easier to hold (much thinner than previous versions of the iPad)It\u2019s built of high quality aluminum just like every other iPad is and constructed to last.PerformanceThe new iPad air is fast! It has an A7 processor in it which is defiantly an upgrade from the previous iPads. The Wi-Fi is even quicker to connect and I notice I can achieve more of my potential in bandwidth speed using this iPad. The new front facing camera makes video chatting much better and the M7 chip makes editing and slow motion shooting fun and a breeze.StorageI upgraded from a 16 GB iPad 3 to a 128 GB iPad Air. Why you ask? Well because I do a lot of traveling for work and Apple is notorious for sneaking in extra stuff on your hard drive that takes up space. My iPad 3 came with only 13.8 GB useable space and after a month I had 3 or 4 GB of \u201cother\u201d storage that no one could figure out how to remove or clear.I mentioned earlier I travel a lot for work so I enjoy watching movies on the plane rides. With my old iPad I never had room for all my movies I had to use a wireless hard drive  (Seagate Wireless Built In Streaming STCK1000100Just to watch my movies. Now with this new 128 GB hard drive I can fit tons of movies on it and I no longer need the old wireless hard drive. (One less thing to lose on travel)Final thought:For people who have an older iPad (like I did) then this is a no brainer buy this new iPad you won\u2019t be disappointed! It is much lighter than previous versions. Wayyy faster! And still sleek and built to last as every other iPad is. The new storage options give you the ability to carry more pictures, movies, books , games with you and the battery life is superb coming in at 10+hours. Overall I am happy with my purchase. It might be a little expensive, but if you buy smart you'll have this tablet for a long time with no problems.", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bad crashing problems, NOT ENOUGH MEMORY Major Fiasco", "Author": "P.

By Apple. If you go in their forums, there are plenty of (new users) people reporting crashing problems. Then you have the level 6 and up users denying there is a problem. Many posts are being censored and deleted by Apple.The 64 bit processor needs more memory than a 32 bit CPU - so in effect, the ipad air has LESS memory than the ipad 4.Do yourself a favor and dont buy the ipad air. It is already obsolete. If you must have an ipad, buy the 4th generation one, or wait until the next one comes out.

The specs are about the same as the New Ipad (iPad 3) and iPad 4. I would definitely get an iPad Air over an iPad Mini, even with the Retina Display, as what made the Mini desirable was the smaller weight and size. The Air is really light, more manageable for someone who uses it continuously.All in all, if you can afford it, it is a great gift, to yourself or seomone else (you really like :)).", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "iPad Review from an Android user!", "Author": "Jason Wang", "ReviewID": "R3MRBK7OU4EGHS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased as a long time android user because I needed something for textbooks and the 4:3 aspect ratio works a lot better for text books than 16:9 (I tired the Nexus 10 for a week as well)..Here is my review after  a week:The first thing I noticed was how light and compact it was, coming from the Nexus 10 I was surprised how easy it was to hold with one hand (although you still wouldn't for long periods of time) and how compact it was for a 10in tablet. The tablet is as fast as anything out right now, to be honest I don't play games but in terms of everyday use everything was fine...but at the same time every iPad that I've used before felt fast as well, I have heard of some issues with tablet optimization for iOS7 but I haven't encountered any. The screen is bright and sharp, text is really easy to read vs a higher PPI tablet (nexus 10) I really couldnt tell a difference with the extra pixels. The color on the iPad is very good once again this is to be expected as Apple always makes high quality devices.The only Cons I can't think of is the speaker placement and feel of the glass (as mentioned in other reviews). The iPad has \"stereo speakers\" which are located on the bottom, I really wish they would have put one on each side instead of both on one side. Watching youtube or netflix in landscape is kind of weird since all the side comes from the right side, kind of defeats the purpose of stereo speakers imo since I never watch fullscreen videos in portrait mode. The nexus 7and 10  have  really good desigsn for speakers that I wish Apple would've adopted.The other con is the feel of the screen, to be honest it feels a bit cheap...compared to previous iPads and the nexus devices the feel of the screen on the iPad air is the worst. It feels like plastic and it just doesnt feel solid when you push down. I'm sure this is a sacrifice that Apple had to make in order to reduce the weight to me the benefits of having a lighter, smaller device outweigh the feel of the screen (something that I'll eventually get used to).Other notes: I haven't used the camera, sorry but I never use the camera on a tablet to take pictures but from what I hear from reviews it takes pretty much what you would expect from a camera on a tablet. I probably wouldn't upgrade if I had an iPad 3 or iPad 4 unless your someone who has to have the newest tech or is absolutely miserable with the weight.If you do want to purchase it you can get it for 479.99 + Tax, go to Walmart's website or you can have any other retailer price match it.All in all this is an excellent tablet besides the minor gripes...the only Android tablet I can see competing with the iPad is the Nexus 10 v2 if it ever comes out...and while I preferred the Nexus 10 for media viewing, real stereo speakers and OS, reading textbooks felt a little cramped and since I'm using this tablet primarily for \"school\" the 4:3 factor fit my needs better.So there it is proof that you can be a fan of both Android and iOS :)", "Date": "November 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Experience", "Author": "Dragember", "ReviewID": "R3RZ0F8IARVY1A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My first tablet was a Nexus 7, and while I enjoyed it immenseilly I was ultimately disappointed in how slow it eventually got (speedy at Christmas, snail slow come April despite factory reset and other attempts to speed it up. Bought my brother a new nexus 7 that summer only to discover its speed was on par with the Nexus I currently owned. Very bizarre). I was skeptical whether or not I would enjoy a tablet experience, so the Nexus 7 was none the less a great first tablet. It could do anything any other tablet could without putting a dent in your pocket.I decided to get the iPad Air this season, specifically the wifi 32gb space gray version.Never owned an iPad before, so I can't really tell you how the models compare,However some things I note, the screen is rather large (duh) which does make typing with the onscreen keyboard difficult. However the screen real estate and quality is stunning, and if typing is a huge issue for you there is the iPad mini and other tablets. That's the trade off, and this is always a choice you have to make between 10 inch vs. 7inch tablets, no matter what brand you're looking at.The glass does feel rather thin, and I am concerned about its durability. I have read that the screen is durable however, and this perception is due to the lightening of the device causing the screen to sound thinner. Supposedly I will be able to confirm this with a case, as the addition of the case will give the tapping of the screen a deeper sound. Apparently it all comes down to acoustics - though a specification on glass thickness versus previous models would be nice.The design of the tablet is exquisite, definitely some top of the line material choices. The tablet has a VERY sturdy feel.Lots of free apps come with this tablet, which all work excellently and efficiently. There is no hesitation between tasks, and the speed is phenomenal.Overall I noticed the quality of apps and how they work on the operating system is MUCH better with apple than it was with android. However, the apple App Store isn't very easy to navigate. Google store is much more user friendly.No widgets, makes customizabibility limited.Multitasking is an ease with this tablet due to gestures. I love how well the gestures work. You can swipe between apps.Battery lasts insanely long, mine averages 12 hours of use.Hasn't overheated (vague warmth can be felt), even with gameplay.Sound from speakers at bottom of iPad sound full. Other tablets I've played with have a tin-metal quality sound emit from them, as though the speakers strain to emit a hearable noise.All iPad Airs, according to Apple's website, come with a complimentary one year limited warranty.Cool front AND back microphones work together to cancel out noise when using skype and FaceTime. Sounds very clear and crisp, I recommend you check out some videos on it.Overall I would say an A+ tablet. I mainly listed some concerns and observations, but that aside this thing is amazing! I love and, it from what I've heard of previous models, I'll hopefully be using this tablet for years to come (number one selling point for me is that apple devices function excellently passed a year).Update December 3, 2013:I've noticed a bizarre memory leak that occurs whenever I watch videos using Apple's video app (love them digital copies). I was testing the video streaming and after I noticed entire GBs were gone! After shutting down the app and fiddling around I realized that the iPad stores memory it buffers and keeps it hostage. However, after going back to the app and quickly loading the same movie and exiting before it begins to buffer the memory reappears. That being said, I wouldn't be surprised that if you watched movies completely through your memory would be restored each time. Still this is a rather large flaw on Apple's part, and I'm not sure if it occurs with any of the other video streaming apps. I'll be sending them a message to see if they're working on a patch for it.", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best tablet just got better", "Author": "G. Ware Cornell Jr. \"anotherlawyer\"", "ReviewID": "R1M0P0IQSS4RK5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When the first iPad was released in the spring of 2010, it was accompanied by a cacophony of jokes about its name and its size. Three and a half years later, the release of the iPad Air, the fifth full-size tablet Apple has offer, has been much calmer. This is the fourth full-size iPad I have owned, beginning with the AT&T; 3G model which was released in May, 2010, about a month after the first WiFi only iPads arrived. Every one of my iPads has had an AT&T; cellular data.Until this model I have purchased the largest capacity solid state drive Apple has offered. This year there is a 128GB iPad, which costs about $100 more than my 64GB model. Here is the reason I did not select the higher capacity-iCloud. Data stored on iCloud is instantly available across multiple IOS and OSX devices. With all that storage (I buy 50GBs annually) why duplicate it on a hard disk?The iPad Air is incredibly light(about a pound) and has a slightly smaller external footprint than previous models. The retina display actually seems sharper, if such a thing is possible. It also holds a charge for even longer than before.Beyond the physical beauty of the iPad Air is its amazing utility. As a trial lawyer I can easily access the firm's network. This means that  every file and every document is instantly at my command. In just a few years time I have learned that I no longer need to drag loads of paper files and depositions with me to court.Over 400,000 apps are built exclusively for iPad, and well over a million iPhone apps run on my device as well. It is an incredibly powerful platform, well on its way to replacing laptops for all but the most labor intensive tasks. When I travel, I typically bring only my iPad-no laptop, no hard copy of a file.  I didn't really appreciate just how dependent I had become on the iPad until this June when a federal judge held that  I could bring  either a laptop or a tablet into the courthouse. I chose the iPad.My weapon of choice-the iPad. This is the one tablet to buy if you are serious about using a tablet.

Plus, the rounded edges on the back make this really comfortable to hold for long periods.I'm glad I went with Apple, because the quality is unbeatable. For something I use everyday, like a tablet, it really is worth the investment. As powerful as a computer, but an absolute dream to use. The iPad Air now comes with the feature-rich word processor and spreadsheets apps, called Pages and Numbers. With included cloud-based collaborative features that can even be accessed from a PC.While there may be cheaper tablets on the market, you certainly get what you pay for.

I have a Samsung Galaxy Note Tab 2 and right away I noticed the weight of the iPad Air. It felt like a feather compared to my tablet. The display is crisp and VERY sharp, I was amazed by that. The only thing she had an issue with compared to my tablet, was that the speakers on the iPad are placed at the bottom and not on the front facing you, like it is on the Galaxy Tab. We turned it up all the way and it definitely gets loud, so it's not like the speakers aren't good. It's a minor gripe for an overall great tablet experience.

I also have a motorola xoom and it doesn't even come close to the ease of use and just generally aesthetics of this ipad.  Its probably best that I break it down into pros and cons to give the most accurate picture I can of what I have found since I bought myself, my wife and my son all the new ipad Airs.--The Good--The business apps I use are all exactly what I hoped for.  I use Chrome for browser and it looks incredible.  When tablets came out, this is what I imagined browsing the internet should look like on a tablet.  The form factor is great, and the Air is as light as advertised.  Despite other's claims of durability issues, I have found it to be quite durable even with my minimal case.  Movies in correct format play flawlessy and my music sounds great.  Paired with some good headphones, long plane trips become tolerable in the worst of seats.  Facetiming with family is a breeze and the 'cool' factor is definitely still present.--The Bad--There are also some cons which I think takes the Air down a half star to a star.  First off the 16GB model which I purchased for my wife from a big box store after I purchased my 64GB from Amazon is simply not enough memory.  I know thats a choice etc but for those that are purchasing for the first time, do NOT buy the 16 GB model unless you plan on mostly using for browsing the internet.  Apps + music + movies will fill up your 16 (actually less after what IOS takes up) gigs very quickly.Second, they should have put a little more RAM in.  The browser occaisonally crashes and there is definitely some latency on scrolling for more content intensive pages.Lastly a few random complaints; the screen also seems dimmer than the ipad with retina (last generation), there is no additional storage, and there seems to be a growing number of junk apps/games.--The Ugly--I will preface this with this: only power users are likely to encounter the ugly.Synching with Apple TV is not as easy as advertised.  Sometimes the air icon shows up, sometimes it doesn't.You can play MKV files but it is painful.  You need a third party player, then you have to transfer movies via http (drag and drop doesn't work), and you will not see where that space went, should you forget about things you've transferred via that method.If you have a home media server and use a PC, itunes + network drives + adding files to the ipad reminds me of the days of the 2400 baud modem.  You wait, and you wait, and you wait.  Anything you really want to transfer, transfer it from your network drive to your pc, then add to library, then transfer to ipad.--Overall--I still prefer this to my android pad or any other tablets I have encountered. The pros outweigh the cons if you have the money to spend considering how much more these are than comperable android tablets.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wifes Toy", "Author": "victor a. quaranta jr", "ReviewID": "RMRD11B7V8WY8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife is very thrifty and seldom ask for anything.

Others about the brightness...indeed I do have it cranked all the way up but the brightness is nowhere as bright as what is found on the Samsung Note 10.1 2014 edition, nor the iPad4 and my most recent purchase the Samsung Note 8. All 3 when cranked all the way up are much brighter than the iPad Air.I will be buying the new Google nexus 7(even with all the GPS and multi-touch issues) for the upcoming holidays but even in the store, that too seems much brighter...I am very dismayed at this lack of brightness from the Air but it is still more than adequate for indoors. I have not tried it outdoors nor will I as this is not my \"outdoor\" tablet...lol.I like Apple and the tight integration of their apps and the reason many including myself continue to buy their products. I do feel the price for this latest iteration is them trying to make money at our expense. WHO HERE DOES NOT KNOW IN THEIR HEART THAT APPLE IS TRYING TO GET IN ON THE CHRISTMAS RUSH AND PUT THE AIR AND THE NEW MINI WITHOUT THE FINGERPRINT FEATURES FOUND ON THE NEW IPHONE...COME MARCH MAYBE APRIL, APPLE WILL UPDATE THE IPAD AIR TO INCLUDE THAT FEATURE.I will continue to buy Apple mostly because their store has apps that are better, with more choices and work extremely well with their devices. I think this product is a 3 1/2 Stars at best and mostly for the size and weight reduction that is very significant. I feel the \"glass\" is too thin but seems to be durable as I have really been typing a lot on it as well as playing several games that require a lot of tapping. I am very happy with the size reduction but feel the brightness is not up to par with other new tablets or the iPad4.Recently the Safari browser has been \"crashing\" a lot over the past week in that when you tap on a hyperlink, the browser will basically disappear off the screen. None of the tabs close but it just disappears and returns you to the home screens. I also am finding the browser will get stuck/freeze for several minutes before resuming. I have several calls in with apple support and they are looking into the issues.Other issues is the VIDEO app, if you play a video via streaming not downloading and leave it somewhere like the middle or so on, it actually reduces your available memory by the amount you have watched from what I can glean. IT IS LIKE DOWNLOADING THE MOVIE TO THE POINT YOU HAVE WATCHED IT TO EVEN THOUGH YOU SELECTED THE STREAMING LINK. If you do this with several movies, you can basically wipe out your free memory. I find it difficult to clear the buffer and have basically learned to tell the app not to display any movies then to display movies then play the movie but move the slider to the beginning and press stop playing then done. Of these many steps I eventually clear the buffer but I am not sure which of all these steps actually is what does it if any!Oh lastly, the WI-fi is fantastic.FINAL RATING IS 3 1/2 STARS...MAYBE 4 IF NOT FOR THE BRIGHTNESS ISSUE.First I own iPad 2 and 4 and Samsung Note 10.1 2014 edition.I like...not love...the new iPad Air as it is faster both in operating the software apps and graphic intensive apps. The apps continue to be fantastic for all the pads not just the Air.Apple did a great job on the weight but FEEL STRONGLY THAT THE NEW SCREEN IS NOT NEARLY AS BRIGHT AS MY iPad 4 NOR DOES IT EVEN FEEL LIKE GLASS.As I type this review on the Air, the \"cheap tapping\" feel of this glass leaves me wondering how durable this glass is. It feels thin and makes a tapping sound not found on the more solid glass on my other two iPads.Oh I am keeping the Air for the faster processors but feel Apple has put out a product whose screen will not be as durable as prior pads.I can see it flex when I push down on it with minimal effort and have some light distortion when I press down like old type LED TVS.Apple over prices their products because they can and really did so on this iteration of their iPad. In my estimation the glass feels like plastic and the brightness is much diminished when compared to my iPad 4 and so must have a higher profit margin with all these cost cutting that resulted in a new iPad that for all practically purposes is just faster but not as solidly built as prior pads.Time will tell on the screen and maybe this is the way all tablets are headed to achieve the weight reduction and thinness. I love the ability to hold the Air in one hand comfortably for much longer than any of my current tablets. I am OK to sacrifice the glass quality as long as the touch screen does not suffer or long term screen reliability.I wish Apple would splurge and include a 6 foot charging cord...OMG $600 for 32GB and the cord is so short still after all this time...lol.", "Date": "November 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very nice hardware for the price! Lightweight, a joy to use", "Author": "Gearhead Mania", "ReviewID": "R3K3EAML83WH3K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using Android products mainly, but I first delved into touch devices with the first generation iPod Touch so I am familiar with iOS to an extent. For the past few years I've used Android FroYo, Gingerbread, Ice Cream Sandwich, and now Jelly Bean. I also have a Kindle Fire HD. The iPad Air is my first iPad, and I chose to go with the iPad Air because it has a much higher resolution than the best Android Tablets, with a really slick dual-core CPU and quad-core GPU. The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 is a close second but is more expensive than the iPad Air which was on sale during a Black Thursday promotion. The Galaxy Tab 3 just doesn't even come close with the screen resolution.The iOS 7 interface is OK. I prefer Jelly Bean's interface. Although clean and simple, the iOS interface isn't intuitive. There are too many sub-menus interwoven in odd areas. To change language, I have to go into no less than 2 sub-menu layers. Siri is fine, but Google Now/Google Search was far more intelligent and effective. Siri's default US female voice is much more realistic and smoother, but Google Now's other voices along with IVONA rectify that situation fairly well.The battery life on the iPad Air is very good. After an hour or so, I'm still above 90%. The WiFi is fast, and the overall UI is smooth. The movie/graphics playback is super fast. I can watch Flash based movies/video within the Safari browser without any hiccups.Compared to my 7 inch Kindle Fire HD, I felt that the 9.7 inch (Air's display size) or 10 inch screen size is just right, but only because the iPad Air is extremely thin and lightweight. The 7 inch KFHD is large enough to be usable for reading magazines, but it is not a good use of space. I have to flick through 2 or 3 screens while the iPad Air will show the entire page (in a very legible font size) in one screen. The KFHD is also heavy, so hopefully the new KFHDX is thinner and lighter.I used to make fun of Apple for going with the Lightning connector, but after using it up close, I can understand why it is innovative. It is made out of a solid chunk of metal with contacts on both sides. There's no \"right\" way of plugging it in, unlike USB where I constantly flip it around trying to figure out which side is up. But I still feel micro-USB is the right way to go, due to its universal acceptance with devices. The included 12W power adapter can actually charge the iPad Air at up to 14W of power based on what I saw with my Kill-A-Watt.With respect to the hardware and design, the iPad Air is outstanding at this price point. Aside from the hardware, the bulk of the iPad Air and Apple experience centers around iTunes, iCloud, and other Apple software. This is an area where I feel Google far surpasses Apple. The Apple ID system is cumbersome and annoying to use. I had to login probably a dozen times during the registration process, and buying/installing free apps required me to enter my password each time. It didn't seem like all of Apple's programs were tightly integrated because I had to use my Apple ID each time I fired up the apps for the first time. Once everything was setup and installed, it seemed fine. That said, installing and running Google's apps on the iPad was significantly less painful. The first time I used my Google account for an app (I believe it was YouTube), all of the other Google Apps recognized me and started syncing. Google Now/Google Search also puts Siri to shame, albeit Siri seems more \"human\" with basic functions. For instance, asking about the weather, Siri actually told me (In Chinese and English) that the weather wasn't very good at 27F. Doing basic searches, Siri and Google Now are about equal, but Google Now seems more intelligent with some of the intermediate activities like unit conversions or advanced searches.I never liked iTunes in the past, and my opinion has not changed with ITunes 11. It is overly complex to use. With Google/Android, I can access Play with a browser and have new apps sent to my devices with the greatest of ease. Syncing calendar events, email, contacts, etc... is also far easier with just using a browser versus the iTunes program on my PC. The good news is that iTunes isn't too bad to use on the iPad. Running Zinio, Conde Naste magazine apps, and other apps was smooth and problem-free.For those that like to use their tablet for browsing or reading magazines, or watching videos, I'd highly recommend a 10 inch display (the Air is 9.7\" but falls in the range). My 7 inch Kindle Fire is fine to use, but it is frustrating to use for magazines due to the amount of panning that is needed. After using the iPad Air, my Samsung Galaxy S3 feels claustrophobic with its 4.9\" display.Overall: 5/5 stars, the iPad Air is a well-designed device with great hardware especially with the Black Thursday/Friday promotions. However, Apple has a lot of catching up to do with respect to its software designs. I very much prefer Google's ecosystem as it is more \"cloud-based\" than what Apple is trying to do. Google's ecosystem feels almost seamlessly integrated while Apple's ecosystem felt more separated.", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Superb", "Author": "kalip", "ReviewID": "RQPH5B045CWYY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my second iPad, I purchased an iPad 4 around a year ago.This iPad air is all I thought it would be and much more; it's muchthinner and the 64-bit A7 processor makes it faster it is also quite narrower although the screen sizeremains the same 9.7 inches.The retina display is  stunning and the battery life is great.

I need to be on the computer for 7-12 hours a day.I already own a MacAir, which I love, but as light as it is, it still weighs about 3 pounds ( still, I highly recommend and love my MacAir!).Anyway, I also have an ipad 3 and an Ipad mini, iphone etc., you get the idea. The reason I am mentioning this, is because I have a bad back and that is the only reason I have been updating devices. I am trying to find the \"perfect\" computer for my use. If I can help even one other person out there in my situation ( and save them a ton of money I had to spend <g>), I will be happy! :)First let me tell you a little about the Ipad Air...IT ROCKS!!Although the speed on the Air is much faster then my Ipad 3, whether syncing with iTunes, browsing the web or just getting emails, the speed was not the reason I upgraded. I am not a game player or a number cruncher so the speed of the ipad 3 was just fine for me.What did get my attention was the weight! I had already bought the new ipad mini, which is super cool and a lot of fun.I actually intend to keep it. However, as good as it's screen is, I cannot see me using it 10 hours a day. If I had 20 year old eyes, it might have beat out my Air! ;-)The a Ipad 3 was about 1.7 pounds. That may not seem like a lot, but for me it could not be a one handed device. I needed to put a case on it, making it 2 pound device. Compared to the Ipad Air, which is about 1 pound, that was almost a 50% reduction in weight! The reason the reduction is so much, is I do not feel I need a case with the Air. I have covered it with clear coat all over and that is it. I do not seeing it slipping out of my hands. However, when I travel, I will use a 5 oz cover or just a Smart Cover (3.5 oz).I know it can be dangerous, not using a case, but I am extremely careful and i bought the special Apple warranty. Besides, isn't the reason we spend so much on these because they weigh so little and are aesthetically pleasing?It is too beautiful to cover up. So far, no regrets at all, but I need to find something to lean the Air against while lying down.If my review helped you, please click \"helpful\" below.

This unit was purchased from another retailer as part of a bundle and offered flexible payments. I was looking at the Air laptop, but then heard iPad air was coming out.  Sadly it will be going back.  iPad air is thin, lightweight, perfect size screen.The color is super sharp.  Super fast typing and going from app to app,, when it wanted to work. Which meant I really couldn't tell you if they worked well or not.  I'd only had it for a day and the screen froze.  Could only go back to the home screen, then loose any work one might have done. Couldn't turn it off. Then, when I was getting ready to put it back in the box, amazingly it decided to work. The set-up wizard was super fast helping this technically challenged person set up and link  all her accounts.  I REALLY liked that it was a tablet and a small laptop as it came with an awesome keypad. So then I started downloading music and wanted to hear the small ball speaker that came in the bundle. The female plug in the air was not quite the right size. I couldn't get a snug fit, also tried with the ear buds and another speaker. And as I fidgeted with the plugs to get a secure connection to receive a signal, the song would stop playing and the volume on the screen kept going up and down. Is this supposed to happen???? As for the sound, I wasn't expecting much from such a thin tablet. The speakers were on the back side but I'm not sure if speakers could be placed in the front. But since the speaker plugs won't fit, what's the point? You'd need to buy some blue-tooth speakers to really hear better soundIt would be hard for me to compare the ipad air to other tablets as this would have been my first touch-screen device other than my android smart phone.I'd have to agree with previous reviews. I also feel this device was rushed on the market before X-mas. With the screen freezing and the plug being poorly made, is a good indication of frantically putting something together and getting it on the market for the holidays. I really hope that the next generation iPad air will be greatly improved as I really like apple products,and software, and was hoping this would be the first.Apple, I am disappointed.

Amazing product.  I have an ipad 4 and this in my house now.  The size and weight of this is terrific, though the comments about the brightness being less and the screen feeling a little cheaper rang true to me as well.I am also having the memory loss issue on the ipad air some have mentioned.  First, there is an ipad 4 in my household and it is also 16gb and, having passed it down to a family member, was very happy with it.  That said, the 16gb Ipad 4 has about 13.5 gb of usable space prior to loading anything, while the air somehow has 12.8.  Not really a big deal.  However, I have noticed my usable memory dropping dramatically (500 mb) on the air when doing streaming or using facetime.  I don't recall that happening on the ipad 4.  The memory does not recover afterwards, even after days and seems to continue to drop 100mb every other day even when I'm not using it.  It is not the apps or newspapers loading, as I pulled a lot of stuff off to check it.  I'm a light user of apps and don't store content, so 16gb was enough in my prior ipads, but on this one I'm getting worried. I was able to free the memory back up, but only after doing a full restore of the ipad as new and letting my cloud stuff stream back.  I really don't want to have to do full restores every few months.  For those interested, when connecting to itunes, it is the \"other\" category of memory that keeps expanding.  Tried calling Apple several times, but all they could offer was to do the restore.", "Date": "November 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Why did I wait so long", "Author": "RUSH46", "ReviewID": "R3TO3MYT3N3189", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this specifically to download and use some speech therapy applications for my wife who had a stroke.

But not without some downfalls due to recent changes.", "Author": "Sean Cushman", "ReviewID": "RNGUUYGUJBQ80", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Alright so I know if you are reading this then you already have your mind set on a new iPad and hey you know what? That's great. I'm a dual user. I love my PC products and Android and I love my mobile Apple products as well. I don't take sides or at least only when it concerns the best bang for the money at least. I've been using iPad's since I bought my mother her first one at release (she is disabled and iPad's (or tablets in general) are wonderful tools for those less than capable of using a keyboard and mouse. I also fell in love with it , the design was just amazing , the feel was great and the capability was very impressive when you consider at that time tablet's were barely around at the consumer level. Seeing the look on her face made it worth every single penny. Prior to getting the iPad she suffered a horrible infection and was hospitalized for 4 months fighting it , nearly losing her life in the process. She lost the capability to stand and only has use of her left hand now (with about 80 percent capability) and couple that with MS and you get someone who can't really use a mouse and keyboard setup easily.I wanted to state that before what I'm sure I will be accused of being a critical troll about the latest iPad version compared to a recent Android tablet I bought.Now onto the experience thus far with this new iPad , here is a list of what I like :1. LIGHT. Seriously , incredibly light. I can hold it in one hand very comfortably and its not meant to be held in such a way for the regular Joe ( I got big hamhocks for hands). I love it when technology trims up as it shows that its forward march is continuing without pause.2. FAST. Even over the iPad 4th generation this lean machine is even faster at multitasking which is good because it will help versus the recent Android tablet I bought which is a multitasking god.3. THIN BEZEL. If there is one complaint I have for the consumer electronics of the world in general its that we haven't done enough to remove overly large bezels from products. I hate them. I find they are a waste of real estate but I also realize that this is part of the technical limitation and the need for space for various reasons (board hardware , batteries and so on). The iPad Air's bezel is at least half of all previous iPad's. Very much appreciated Apple.Those are the biggest reasons to buy an iPad Air and they are really good ones in my mind. If you already own an iPad 4th gen though I don't think they are enough to justify the upgrade unless you really want the reduced weight (the iPad 4th gen is a pound and half while the iPad Air is only a pound flat).Now to the cons. And there are some that are very concerning and especially so if you tend to treat your products poorly (many people do..) :1. THIN PIECE OF GLASS. So while I realize that Gorilla Glass 3 is very impressive and amazing tough for its extremely thin profile .. I also feel its wildly out of place with a product like the iPad. People who buy iPad's and especially families tend to treat them pretty rough. I've seen children as young as 4 drop a 3rd gen iPad like a brick onto hardwood and it remained intact without a mark to bare. This new iPad Air has a very thin piece of GG3 that helps reduce the weight (and I would imagine the cost of manufacturing for Apple) but its recently been shown in several Youtube videos that when it comes to endurance its actually pretty fragile. Its very easy to crack it and especially so if it lands on its side. So while all the previous generation iPad's had a nice thick piece of glass to help protect the product this new one .. does not. It also sounds hollow when you tap it. And for some that drives them crazy. I don't mind this as I know its glass and not plastic like some \"claim\".2.COST. Since Apple did so much to slim down the cost of this new iPad and they used the EXACT same guts as the iPhone 5 (with a different layout and power profile) and yet they also trimmed down the battery size then how come this isn't any cheaper? The iPad mini is supposedly Apple's response to critics about the fact that its always the same price in each iteration. Apple , Android has fantastic alternatives now and the Google Play marketplace is becoming quite a fleshed out competitor , its time to start taking Android more seriously as a competitor and stop living inside your own eco bubble.3.SUB PAR HARDWARE VERSUS PRICE. Even with a new 64-bit chip (which isn't supported very well but that will change) the iPad is quite a puny product in terms of hardware specs. NOW BEFORE YOU FREAK OUT.. I know that Apple has optimized it heavily and that living in a very closed ecosystem (versus Android) gives it this advantage HOWEVER.. for what you are paying for you should be getting more. 1GB of RAM for instance? That's what I expect in a mid to low end smartphone these days. I can imagine those who complain (and have for a while now) about the random crashes because of running of memory would really love an extra 1GB of RAM for the iPad. I would also imagine it would do wonders for those who love to open programs by the truckload and not have to worry about random crashing errors due to running out of memory.Could you imagine a quad core A7 chip with 2 GB's of RAM? That beast would sing and you could do even more with an iPad that powerful. I would bet that when Apple moves towards 4k resolution that we will be getting those exact specs to run at that monster resolution but still I would have loved that right now.So my remarks about a recent Android tablet purchase.. I bought a Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 and I just have to say its a real beast and outshines Apple's best in many ways. The resolution is higher (2500x1600) and it comes with the S-Pen and S-Pen software plus an office suite of apps. Now the Note Pro 12.2 is made for business applications the price of it versus 64GB iPad is about a hundred more. But for that hundred more you get massive hardware support , with an OTG USB cable you can connect external hard drives to it , you can also add memory through SDXC cards (up to 128GB's) and Samsung's Touch Wiz is getting quite mature and really offers a very set of apps. Not to mention the screen size of 12.2 inches versus 9.7. However the iPad beats it in terms of weight , the Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 has a massive battery (but it lasts about 11 hours with heavy use) and the weight puts it into a class that speaks more towards laptop replacement that competitor to the iPad. However you can buy the non-pro versus for $100 less (you won't get the S-Pen) and still a get a monster solution.Android's tablet app market is getting better and better each week and there are plenty of apps that support landscape mode without issue. One thing I always thought Android did better was application scaling , something Apple could learn from frankly. The Galaxy Note 3 Pro in my mind is a Android finally getting its ducks in a row and Apple is going to have pick the pace to keep with Android's MASSIVE market share which is over double what Apple's is now.THAT BEING SAID.. I'm keeping the iPad Air. I love the Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 and its just a great tablet but I don't really have need of its business level features. But if I were going to recommend a tablet for a business minded individual I would recommend they go for it because it blows the iPad away for business use. The free office app it comes with is more fleshed out than MS Office for the iPad and the extra screen real estate is a big bonus for anyone attempting real work on it. But for a guy like me the iPad has an easier to consume profile and that's what I really love about it.If you intend to buy this product however (the iPad Air) I HIGHLY recommend you buy the Apple care warranty.

Great to play games on, manage finances, edit photos, etc. all on a generously sized high resolution screen. I like that mine came with a screen protector. That was a plus. Make sure to buy a protective case and/or apple smart cover - as it completes the whole experience rather nicely. I got a handmade pouch/sleeve to carry it in at a really good price on Etsy, just search for ipad sleeve and there will be many different styles to choose from. Best tip I can give to the cellular device users is to go to Tmobile and pay the $10 fee for a SIM card that will give you 200MB of free LTE data for LIFE! Even though it's true that once you go over the limit, the speed is reduced to 2G, there are no overage charges. It's been great for really light data users such as myself as I only need it when not in the presence of a wifi connection (very rare).

Apple constantly thrives to improve there products, and this one is no exception. The new IOS coupled with the blazing fast 64-bit a7 chip makes this one of the fastest tablets I have used! The ease and simplicity of this tablet makes everyday emails, messaging, projects,etc. no problem. This is the only tablet I have looked forward to using.Now for more serious activities like gaming and other intensive applications, the iPad has no problems what so ever. The graphics are very smooth, almost life-like.  From the outside, this is the most beautiful tablet hands down. From the chamfered edges to the sleek aluminum back, this is a high quality device. Most other tablets are made out of cheap plastics, not this one. Everything feels well made and solid. Even though apple chose to use metals and other high end materials, the iPad remains one of the lightest and thinnest full size tablets you can buy. Another high point for the iPad air its the battery. It seems to go on forever! After using it throughout the day, I end up with 70 to 80 percent battery! Its unbelievably how much juice this thing holds! Some miscellaneous things about the iPad that push it even further over the top are the decent cameras and the excellent microphones and speakers. The speakers have a good base tone and very clear high pitches. Overall I would recommend this tablet to anyone looking for a device that can do pretty much anything. I just don't see anyway the apple can improve on this iPad. I guess we will just have to wait and see.

Even though it didn't have a front or back camera. I didn't mind.It's pretty heavy so, i just layed it down on a tablemost of the time. It was all fun and games, until the ios7 update came out a few months ago. After the new update,I could barely do anything on it. All of my favorite apps were no longer useable and, I had to delete them all because theyrequired the new update. After ios7, the first gen ipad suddenly became useless and, I felt cheated out on the amount ofmoney that was spent on that ipad. I'm very surprised that the ipad 1 only costs 200 hundred dollars less than the new one.Even though generation one is a discontinued model. In my opinion, it should be off the market completely. Why bothergetting this outdated device, when you can buy the newest one for $200 more? The ipad air has a completely different feel to it. It's a hundred times lighter.The iPad air has so much new things like Siri. Some people may think asking a electronic device to do something for you might be a bit lazy but, you can make a reminder within 5 seconds without leaving your current app. Siri has better results when searching for something specific. It's also helpful if you're slow at texting or, if your hands are full. Browsing the web is a lot faster but, downloading an app may take a while depending on your Internet connection.

As light and thin as this tablet is it still feels solid and sturdy. The screen is beautiful and the colors are deep and rich.

It is lighter, thinner, narrower, faster and has stereo speakers. Its almost half a pound lighter which really makes a difference when holding the ipad in your hands for long periods of time. I no longer need to use my ipad stand. Typing and holding it in portrait mode are much easier. People with larger hands will be able to hold the ipad with one hand very easily. Performance is also much improved with new A7 processor. Apps open, close and switch faster than on the ipad 4. Wifi is now double the speed with the double mimo antenna. For those who have supporting routers loading web pages, downloading apps, books, videos, music is much faster. The new stereo speakers are much loader and have more bass than on the previous ipad. The stereo affect will only be noticed when holding the iPad in portrait mode. This is a shame since you wont enjoy the stereo affect when watching a video or playing a game in landscape mode. Also the speakers are very easy to muffle if you cover one or both of them on the right side in landscape mode. The main flaw of the ipad air is its lack of 2GB of ram. When browsing and having more than a few tabs open this is very noticeable. The tabs have to reload when switching back and forth. This also becomes an issue when switching between apps that are open. Both the ipad 3 and 4 had 2GB of RAM. The only reason I can think of why apple decided not the upgrade the RAM is to make customers upgrade to the next ipad. The other downside to the ipad air is the fact that its running ios 7. ios 7 for the most part is in improvement over ios 6. It is faster and has more features, but, it also has many bugs that still need to be fixed. Even with 7.04 installed I still experience rotation issues. The ipad doesnt auto rotate when switching between portarit and landscape mode. This issue occurs atleast once a day. Mainly when the multitasking gestures is enabled and auto rotation. There are many threads on apple discussions forums about this issue. I thought at first my ipad was deffective even made an appointment to see a genius. I was told there was no way to test the hardware but was offered a warranty replacment. I decided instead to exchange the ipad and the replacement also had the same issue. I have to add also my ipad 4 had the same issue also when I updated it to ios 7. I hope apple fixes this issue in 7.1. This is very annoying and not something I expected from apple. The ipad air also doesnot have the ability to run 2 or more apps at one time which both the new samsung note 10.1 2014 and Microsoft surface tablet can do. I did try the samsung tablet briefly and found the screen and speakers much better than the ipad air's. The ipad still is the best larger tablet on the market because it has a huge selection of tablet apps and it gets the apps first before any other platform. I also love the battery life on my ipad air. I was getting about 15 hours of usage on my ipad 4 with the brightness at 35% and about 5 notifications with browsing and email. Now with the ipad air I am gettting more than 15 hours. Anywhere from 16-18 hours of battery life depending on my usage. The new ipad air is must have for gamers, power users and people who take the ipad on the go. If you can wait the next ipad will defeintly have 2GB of RAM and wont have as many bugs. There is also a good chance a new ipad will be released in the next 1-2 years which will be larger in screen size and more powerful named the ipad pro.Update after owning for more than 4 months: Apple just released the 7.1 update. My iPad Air is finally stable, this is what ios 7 should have been from the start. There are no more crashes, reboots and the auto rotation issue is fixed. I am still giving this ipad 4 stars since it took apple more than 4 months to fix these issues. Also the ipad lacks 2gb of ram, there are no widgets, thrid party keyboards, expandable storage or way to run 2 apps at once side by side. The iPad Air is till the best 10 inch tablet on the market. It beats any android or microsoft tabelt currently on the market in the 10 inch category.

In hindsight, I\u2019m glad I did otherwise I wouldn\u2019t have bought this tablet.Before deciding on the iPad Air I considered the Kindle Fire and Nexus 7. The Microsoft Surface wasn\u2019t an option since I really don\u2019t like the operating system or customer service and I wanted my tablet to last longer than a year. Samsung wasn\u2019t an option after the torture my Galaxy S3 put me through, which also ruled out Android, which then ruled out the Nexus 7. Some people are a fan of Android but I find it to be slow, unreliable and choppy. The aesthetic design isn\u2019t my favorite either. But these are all a matter of personal opinion and experience. :)The Kindle Fire HDX looked great at first, but in the end I decided it wasn\u2019t for me. I\u2019m a writer and a student so being able to edit documents on the go is my main concern. I have an iMac so this unfortunately made using the Kindle for these purposes a little more difficult for me. While I can edit and share most documents on my iMac, including Microsoft Office, I primarily use Pages which isn\u2019t available on the Kindle. I just don\u2019t care for either Microsoft Word or Google Docs enough to use them all the time. Also, I never use the Amazon store to watch movies or shows or download music so that feature wasn\u2019t appealing to me. I took a trip to Best Buy to try it out just in case that made me change my mind. This actually solidified my decision against it. While the Kindle Fire did feel surprisingly solid, I didn\u2019t like the position of the buttons, smaller screen size (although the screen quality was pretty awesome) or the thick boarders around the screen. Again, all of these are a matter of preference.When I went to try out the iPad Air I was surprised by how much lighter it felt than the previous model iPad. I also liked the flat back and thinner edges on the side. It made using it easier for small handed people like me. The larger screen size made typing on the tablet much easier in those rare instances I might not have my keyboard. Keeping my documents in one place is amazingly simple and I like the applications I use for writing and classes. Also, iTunes U is just awesome!The only drawback for me is the price: I paid $300 more than I would have with the Kindle Fire HDX. I don\u2019t think this is outrageously expensive, considering the larger screen, better hardware, operating system and customer service-- not to mention iTunes U-- but I do think the price could be lower.While there are other great tablets out there, I really enjoy my iPad Air. Electronics are all a matter of personal preference anymore anyway. If you don\u2019t like a device, don\u2019t buy it. It\u2019s that simple. :)", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Heavy Apple user, this not up to snuff", "Author": "JustAGuy", "ReviewID": "R13PZL77MK3WNV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I upgraded from the ipad 1 to the ipad air mainly because of constant crashes with the ipad 1.The Air still crashes.

Apple's failure to fix this is unacceptable.", "Date": "March 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Wish It Just Worked (Without Crashing So Much) And A Comparison With Other Devices", "Author": "S. Jo", "ReviewID": "R14O4T9NDREA0U", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I'm not happy with this tablet but I got a good deal on it from one of the retail stores, $100 off, and it fits my needs best compared to what's currently being offered.The iPad Mini 2 is lighter but the screen is smaller and can't display as many colors, less gamut display. I've noticed this with my \"old\" Samsung Galaxy Tab 7 Plus, but this may not matter to some people.The Kindle HDX and Nexus 7 (2013) are, in that order, reported to have better screens- ppi and gamut display. However I'm not interested in buying too much into the Amazon App Store because I'm already in the plain Android ecosystem. The Samsung tablet line is not in consideration because I got burned by how the copy and paste function just stops working- a reset would fix it and soon after it would stop working. This issue first showed itself months after I got the device. I also wasn't interested in taking the time to jailbreak the Samsung tablet for that reason alone.I recently got a deal on the Nexus 7 (2013) and I'm getting it this week. I may keep it as a backup tablet and it's a plus that I'm already in the Android ecosystem. It has 2GB of RAM instead of Apple's current 1GB of RAM standard. It also comes with stock Android and the operating system can be easily upgraded without relying on mods. I'm hoping it will last 5 years but I've learned from the Amazon customer reviews that hardware quality control is an issue.Now back to the iPad Air. Aside from the screen I wanted the \"Apple Experience\" of \"It just works.\" I like using a tablet for browsing and reading books. I also liked the idea of having access to apps that are exclusive to Apple. I've had the iPad Air for a little over a week and I'm really enjoying the bigger screen. I'm not sure I can really switch back to a smaller screen. I've downloaded a few apps, cooking related, that are exclusive to iOS and they're nice to have. Multitouch gesture is ok but the Android way of switching between apps and viewing running apps are more elegant.Why I took off three stars is because the iPad Air crashes a lot. It got to the point that I'd add a tab on Safari and it would crash even though I only had two other tabs open. I installed Chrome and the crashes happened less but they did not disappear. Search for iOS 7 crashes and low memory and you'll see this is a problem with a lot of iOS devices since the iOS 7 was introduced. I noticed other apps doing the same thing but maybe because I use them less I don't see them crashing as often.I had set up a phone appointment with Apple Support on Sunday and was told that upgrading to iOS 7.0.4 via WiFi might have caused the iOS to not fully update. I couldn't stay on the phone for too long so yesterday I did reset my tablet and set the iPad as New. I didn't buy their reasoning but I did like the Customer Support experience- setting up an appointment online etc.I really like the bigger screen and it's probably better for my eyes so I'm keeping the device. I'm also counting on Apple to fix the issue sooner rather than later- in various forums you'll read about people resetting their iOS device and doing multiple exchanges with no relief from the crashing. I will sign up for Apple Care+ which includes 2 Years of Tech Support and Accidental Damage so I can exchange the device if needed.", "Date": "December 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worth Every Penny", "Author": "GTJ3D_shopper", "ReviewID": "R2VDMUVOAX7XI1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great quality, light, fast, easy to use.

He loved it so much that we got one for him. We bought the Apple cases for both of them and my husband bought the stylus, as well.We  are both very pleased with these tablets. My husband has a neurological condition and the accessibility features and stylus have been wonderful for him. He stopped using his laptop for portability, because the iPad Air does everything he wants. We were afraid it would be too heavy for him to hold, but he has found it to be lightweight and comfortable, and it does weigh less than earlier iPads. Anyone with vision and fine motor skills problems is almost certain to love the iPad Air, especially when combined with the stylus.I dropped my iPad twice when in parking lots, both times from low heights, but on hard surfaces. The case protected it and I have had no problems resulting from the drops.We use our iPad Airs primarily for reading Kindle books. Our joint account has a huge archive and our other devices were not handling it. The K4iPad app and this unit work beautifully together and we have had no problems accessing our books. This iPad is powerful.We were worried about how comfortable it would be to read for long periods because we kept hearing that tablet screens bothered one's eyes. We found it easy to use the settings to adjust the screen lighting, and found an adjustment that has caused no eye problems, even when reading for several hours. It has been very comfortable. We have also read in fairly bright sun with no problems. However, when the sun was actually hitting the screen, it was impossible to read on it.We do use the iPad Air for many other functions. Games, surfing the web, eMail, videos, music, photos, YouTube, social networking sites, and so on, work as well as on a computer. The battery lasts a long time and the 3G is a real bonus when wi-fi is not available.I have seen some negative reviews of the iPad Air, and I don't doubt that some people have had bad experiences. All I can say is that we have had good experiences with Apple. Our iMac was out of warranty and still working when Apple notified us they were replacing the hard drive on all iMacs like ours, because the hard drives had an unacceptable failure rate. When we took it in to the Apple store, I asked them to also check my iPod Touch, which was two years out of warranty and had become very temperamental and glitchy. They found a corrupted file on the iPod Touch and got it set up and working for me, and didn't charge anything.

I use it for a small business and it has all the apps I need. I love the size of the device - large screen yet the tablet is nice and thin and light. The case that I got for it adds a very minor amount of bulk. As a new Apple user I was impressed by how easy the interface is to use. Since I have to store a lot of photos for my business, I purchased the 32gb model and I'm glad I did. Even though I store most of my stuff on a cloud app, I'm glad I don't have to worry about filling up my tablet.PROS:GREAT battery life. I literally had this on for 3 days straight during a convention and it was used constantly - just barely made it down to 20% battery by the end of the 3 days. Charges back up fairly fast tooScreen size is big but not too big, tablet is lightweight and thinEverything runs fast and smoothCONS:Cord of the charger it came with is very short (just a minor gripe, but still!)Screen gets dirty easily and I haven't found a decent screen protector yet (another minor gripe)Safari, the default browser, sucks.

Know Samsung has its own perks that Apple doesn't offer but I would still say its a fair superior product then the note.

I had cracked my screen and it seemed as if it was slowing down over time, probably due to the updated operating systems putting more stress on the aging processor and memory.So, I saw a good deal on a used model appear on Amazon, and decided to go for it. For little over $500, after I traded in my older model, I had a brand-new, or close to it, iPad Air. The first thing you'll notice is the weight. It is at least half that of the previous models. The bezel thinner on the sides and the new thunderbolt port on the bottom. I also love the addition of stereo speakers, as I own one of the biggest recording studios on the East Coast and love to try out the music I produce on a multitude of sound systems. This allows me to hear what I've done in stereo, on a lower common denominator, so as to know what my music sounds like coming from the speakers of a system millions of people own.The next thing I noticed, is the screen seemed quite a bit brighter then my iPad 3. This could just be because of the aging screen tech under the glass, or some other factor. But it definitely helps for reading, even at half power, in darker and lighter situations that I have no control over. Next up, the speed at which everything operates. Not only loading software and apps, but in switching apps and multitasking. There is just a zip to everything now.The biggest thing I noticed, the Internet is 10 times as fast as it was in my prior model. I'm going to guess the MIMO has something to do with that, along with the two antennas. Giving a stronger signal, which in turn allows for the fastest Internet possible. I have 50 Mb Internet, and I now feel like I'm using every bit of it in doing something as simple as loading webpages or downloading videos, games and music. When I load a webpage, everything appears instantly, no more loading in of different aspects of that page, everything is just there. I think it is the first time, and Ive owned  hundreds of computers over the years, that I've noticed any webpage load so instantly.Games look every bit as good as they can, due to the increased processing power of the CPU and GPU. If Apple would only make a proprietary gamepad for the iPad, they would have a true contender for a great video game system on the market. Some of the games, especially those from Gameloft and EA, have every bit the quality that you see from any game on modern systems, bar a few effects here and there.Even music production can be done at high-quality, for the home or studio producer, with decent results. I've heard some songs recorded completely via the iPad, that you would've sworn were done in multi-million-dollar studios. They are that good. Which goes to show, great music is made by a great producer and not the equipment behind him.So, to sum things up:Positives:Great, bright, high resolution screenSmaller and lighterIncredible portable powerGreatly improved internet speedStereo speakers built inAwesome games and production softwareCheap accessories from third party vendorsNegative:Price, though I imagine we would sacrifice some quality at a lower price pointOverall, you will not find a better portable computer for the price. Anything Windows is going to have issues. Whether that be with drivers, malware, viruses or some or the other issue that goes along with owning a Windows machine. Sure, they are more powerful and will allow you a greater depth of software, but you make trade-offs with that power in size, weight and ease-of-use. So, if you have the means, definitely get the iPad Air. The upgrades are truly worth the extra cost over previous models.

Is it the best tablet for you?", "Author": "John Ryan", "ReviewID": "R99F4BEOZO0JF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The new iPad Air is Apple's latest, slimmest, lightest release of their hand-held computer. Oddly enough, it's so beautifully easy to use (my one year old daughter loves playing with it), it's almost doesn't feel like a computer at all.A word of warning - this review is written for people who've never owned an iPad before - and are wondering what all the fuss is about. If you're thinking of upgrading skip down to the \"What's great about the Air\" section below, or just buy it - it's amazing.Just what's all the fuss about?--------------------------------------I used to own a laptop for work, and (very occasionally), it'd sit on my lap on the sofa, and I'd use it for pleasure (eMail, watching films or playing the odd game). Then I bought my first iPad, and the laptop became redundant, a boring \"work device\". Hard to explain, but the fact the iPad is so small and light, and you navigate around with your finger by pointing and gently swiping the screen makes the whole experience a lot easier - a lot more fun.Even my most \"luddite\" of friends have been won over.It's incredibly simple and easy to use (it only has one main button), and everyone from my one year old daughter to my 85 year old dad have taken to without problems. It's size and shape also support using it like a book (literally to read a book or web page), but you can also watch TV and films.Personally I'm also paranoid about my password getting \"hacked\", and someone running up a huge Amazon bill or buying stuff with my credit card on eBay. Well one of the benefits of the iPad (and iPhone) is it's \"almost impossible\" to get a virus - one of the most common ways to get hacked. This doesn't mean you shouldn't use strong passwords, (both Sony and Adobe got hacked), but it's reassuring to leave the Windows world behind.Finally, I love the way these devices (iPad, iPhone, Apple TV, Apple Mac), increasingly work together. The fact you can start a Pages document on your Mac and edit it on your iPad, or take photos on the iPhone, and in seconds see them on the iPad or Mac and display them on the Apple TV.The thing is, \"it just works\".What would you use if for?----------------------------------* Shopping online. Obviously - you could be reading a review on Amazon about the iPad Air!* Reading web pages. As you can hold it like a book it's great to read the news online (my wife loves the Daily Mail Online).* Reading Books. It's great for reading books from Amazon Kindle or Apple Books with the benefit of 1,000s of online book reviews* Navigating web pages. Instead of clicking with a mouse, you gently swipe your fingers on screen to scroll around* Watching Films. I use it to watch Netflix online videos (with an Apple TV you can send stuff to the telly)* Watching TV. With the free BBC iPlayer app you can catch up or download BBC programs* Reading and replying to mail. I use \"mailbox\" a great free app to read and reply to mails, but there's a free one included* Showing and organising photos. Any photos on an iPhone are automatically available within minutes in \"the cloud\"* Playing games. From fun puzzle games like \"Cut the Rope\" to fully fledged first person shooters.* Listening to the Radio. With \"Tune in Radio\" you can listen to thousands of radio stations world-wide.* Listening to music. I stream mine to an Apple TV, but you can also buy portable speakers or just plug into the AUX socket* Editing Word, Excel and Powerpoint documents using FREE App \"QuickOffice\" (owned and supported by Google).* Editing Pages, Numbers and Keynote documents (Office for the Apple) on the FREE Apple apps.* The list goes on and on.Update: You can edit Word, Excel and Powerpoint documents (plus Pages, Numbers and Keynote) on the iPad (although I'd recommend an external keyboard - see below). It's definately powerful enough, although I'd not expect these apps to cope with REALLY complex document layouts. Great for general letter and document writing though.Which model should I buy?----------------------------------I can't comment about Android tablets (apart from the Google Nexus 7 which is well regarded), but in terms of the Apple tablet line-up in order of cost:-1. Avoid the Apple iPad 2, it's a relatively old model, under-powered and with a lower resolution screen. If you really want an Apple but don't want to spend the cash, buy a 16g WIFI 3rd or 4th generation iPad from eBay. Avoid this one.2. iPad mini is a lovely tablet. A 7.9 inch screen and astonishingly light and remarkably thin - it feels like a light-weight book.3. iPad mini with retina screen. Again 7.9 inch screen, but with the blazingly fast A7 chip and a \"retina\" (high definition) screen. Worth the upgrade if you can afford it.4. iPad Air. Much larger screen size (9.7 inches - doesn't sound much but it makes a huge difference). Same fast (A7) chip as the Mini with Retina - the latest and fastest iPad available.Clearly (from my viewpoint) there's only really three options. The iPad Mini, the Mini with retina screen and Air.What are the Optional add-ons?-----------------------------------------Well, assuming you've dropped by the Apple Store or John Lewis (which I would highly recommend), and handled the iPad Mini (with/without retina screen), and iPad Air then your options are around memory size and cellular option.Memory: Once bought, you can't add memory (space for apps, films, books etc). However, the basic price goes up a huge amount (+\u00a380 for the 16g to 32g iPad Air). But, having owned a 16g and then a 32g iPad - I can safely recommend the 16g unless you really want to store a huge amount of videos and downloads. Only you can decide, and if you're lucky enough that money is no object then splash out. Otherwise, 16g should be fine for most people.Celular: Allows you to connect to the internet while you're out and about. This will add an additional +\u00a3100 to the price and means you can slip in a mobile phone SIM card. This means (for an additional \u00a37-15 a month extra), you can access the internet on the move. Alternatively, you can opt for the WIFI option, and use it at home or at at \"hot spot\" (eg. Starbucks, most rail stations and hotels etc).Personally I'd buy (and indeed did), the 16Gb iPad Air WIFI.Do I need anything else?-------------------------------Most people (me included) buy a cover. Apple (and now several copy-cats) make a \"smart-cover\" which automatically shuts down the iPad when you close it, and switches it on when you open it. There's versions which cover the back, or just the screen. Apple charge from \u00a335 to \u00a365 for their (admittedly) high quality fabric or leather covers, but there's many available from \u00a310. Be aware, you do get what you pay for.Personally,I think it's a pity to cover the beautiful aluminium industrial design of the iPad with a cover - but if you've spent hundreds of pounds you'll want to protect it from scrapes and bangs.I also invested in a keyboard (\u00a325-80), as I tend to write a lot of mails and documents (remember it comes with a word processor). I'd recommend the Logitech Ultra Thin iPad Air Case with Keyboard - Space Greyand the ZAGG Keys iPad Air Case Folio with Backlit Keyboard - Black although these are strictly optional unless you want to use your iPad as a proper laptop.Finally, if you have another Apple device (eg. an iPhone, Apple TV or Mac) you'll find these work together beautifully. For example, you can create a reminder on your iPad and it appears on your iPhone. Equally, photos taken on your iPhone appear on your iPad, and you can stream music or videos from iPad, iPhone or Mac to an Apple TV.Some people think this \"locks you in\" - but it's your choice.What's great about the Air?-----------------------------------* Lighter (30%) and thinner than the previous version (469g from 650g)* Even faster A7 chip. Blazingly fast!* Improved sound (compared to the iPad 4)* Software including+ iMovie - edit and publish home made movies+ Numbers - Fully functional Excel for the iPad+ Pages - Word processor+ GarageBand - Play a piano or a drum kit+ iPhoto - Edit and organise your photosWhat's not so great?--------------------------* The change in physical size means you'll need a new keyboard or replacement cover if you're upgrading* Pity Apple didn't include the \"touch ID\" to secure your passwordsOverall Opinion---------------------It's hard to believe the iPad version 1 was released just four years ago, and there's a huge raft of \"me too\" tablet computers to choose from, but the Apple iPad Air is still the one to beat. As \"Which?\" magazine (in the UK) put it - \"...the best tablet we've ever tested. Apple packs a beautiful screen and lightning fast processor into a slimmer-than-ever shell, and battery life is very impressive\".Yes, there are cheaper Android based alternatives, but the quality, design and beauty of this tablet just sets it apart. If it were a car it'd be a top of the range Mercedes or a BMW.Highly Recommended.", "Date": "February 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Apple does it again", "Author": "Robert Garner", "ReviewID": "R2A8NVDAH0DGG5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is not my first iPad.

The design of the graphics is so intuitive that any child or technophobe can master it and feel at home in a few minutes, which makes it the perfect entry-point into IT for someone who has so far avoided computers.One of the clever things Apple have done is the creation of the individual `Apple ID' which means once you enter your ID & password your iPad, iPhone, iPod and Mac immediately share all their files, and everything you created or stored on one device becomes available on them all: photos, music, reminders, address book, documents are all shared. This is probably the most brilliant idea ever in the IT mass market to create brand loyalty among consumers and `locks you in to the corporation for the duration'.Now, the bad news: the software crashes from time to time necessitating a reboot, which is annoying and inconvenient. This fault is acknowledged by Apple, as the software has a few bugs. Also the wireless reception is not all it might be, as it sometimes (mysteriously) fails to connect to even a moderately strong signal.Apple's pricing structure does not reflect the cost of manufacture but is driven by a market segmentation strategy, so the price really cranks up if you want an iPad with more memory or which can use the GSM phone network. The best value is the 16G Air without Cellular, which only connects to the internet via WiFi. 16G is a lot of memory by the historic standards of portable computers and you'll only find it insufficient if you want to store a lot of big files like films or powerpoint presentations.You'll need a carrying case to protect it (scores of different designs are available) and maybe a keyboard, which if you're doing a lot of writing and document creation rather than just surfing the internet is the one essential accessory, as without a separate keyboard the usable screen area is reduced in size. Around one million downloadable apps for Apple devices means you can personalize your iPad and make it into more or less whatever you want. The Air design is aesthetically a work of beauty in its simplicity, cleanness of lines and proportion, and despite some irritating niggles is a pleasure to own and use.", "Date": "January 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Always love Apple", "Author": "Patricia Coykendall", "ReviewID": "R2Q8KB9C8ZHKQW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "All said it would be and more, had the I pad 2 and this is so much faster and lighter", "Date": "January 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love it, love it, LOVE IT!!!", "Author": "Maryanne", "ReviewID": "RX8WHXEP7PHLS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I honestly love this tablet like crazy!

I bought the original iPad, iPad 2, and iPad 3 (which I returned because of heating issues and thickness/weight and went back to the iPad 2).I was ready to buy a new iPad because my iPad 2 16gb was filled up.  So I decided on the iPad Air. The first thing I noticed when I took it out of the box was that it really is much lighter than even the iPad 2.  The screen is the same size, but the frame is narrower, so it's smaller overall.  I have the white 128gb wifi version.  Set up was problematic though, which is why I've taken away a star.  When asked to put in my home wifi password, I received a message that it was entered wrong. Repeatedly.  Well, it wasn't wrong because it's the same password as my other wireless devices.  Nothing I did would make it take the password, so I called Apple tech support. After being on the phone with the technician for at least 45 minutes, nothing worked. Turning my modem and router off and on did nothing. Changing some of the iPad's settings, again, nothing. I felt disappointed, frustrated, and let down by Apple. Finally, the tech set an appointment for me to take it into the Apple store and see if they could get it to connect to their wifi. Before we hung up, the tech suggested I connect the iPad to the iTunes on my computer and do a complete software restore and see if that would resolve the connection issue.  I did this, which took about an hour, and FINALLY was able to connect to my wifi. The connection has been stable so far.Other than the above initial connection problem, I am really loving the iPad Air. Sharp retina display, thinner and lighter, and faster connection (I use the Mercury Browser, not clunky Safari). The white frame with silver edges is really nice looking. I read a lot of ebooks, so the lighter weight is very much appreciated since it can be held comfortably with one hand. I also listen to audiobooks and this iPad has two speakers instead of one. They're located on the edge of the device, not the back, so you don't have to have the iPad back side up to get unmuffled sound. The sound quality of the iPad Air is superior to the iPad 2, and the volume can be turned up slightly louder. I've only played one game so far, Plants vs. Zombies 2, but it plays great. I don't use the camera and really wish Apple would make a version sans that option. It feels cool when holding--the iPad 3 I had got too warm on one side, which this one doesn't do. I haven't had any other problems and I think this is the best iPad yet. As far as the initial wifi connection issue I had, I'm going to assume this was a fluke with my device, and not something a lot of people are experiencing (although I have seen a few mentions of this on some of the Apple forums).", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Its perfect", "Author": "Benedito Eloi Maya \"Maya\"", "ReviewID": "R3PBL8USTW8GYJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This product is amazing.

If you have doubts shoot me a comment, I can help!Having used several tablets, I like the hardware weight and screen resolution of iPAD Air. It takes 3-4 years for a tablet maker to reach an acceptable level. All previous full size iPADs were heavy for me. I won't go into details of iOS7 itself. I am also disappointed Apple has GPS only on 4G models. The apps and security of iOS platform is generally good. What I don't like is the iTunes way of syncing up. Not a USB drap and drop. This is the primary reason for me giving a 4 stars. Android trumps in this regard.Overall being a geek, I like all makers. I don't bias and want Apple to succeed. Success of Apple will propel Google and other makers of tablets. My wishlist is to try a a Windows tablet once they get through a iteration cycle in late 2014.Overall iPAD is a delightful tablet as long as you accept its limitations.

The hardest choice.", "Author": "Mumbly Joe \"MumblyJoe\"", "ReviewID": "R1EP8MRB01CCTV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A lot of people have already talked about the merits of this device and the pros and cons. For me the decision wasn't so much which to buy but rather which one I wanted. Originally I got the mini to replace my kindle touch because of the price and the pocketable size. Ultimately I ended up with the air. Here's why:Grip: despite the very comfortable dimensions for 1 handed holding of the mini the extra thin bezel proved problematic. The palm rejection tech is supposed to be quite good but I found it unreliable and for those times I wanted to gets.  Eventually I always wanted to get a hold of it with  the bezel between my thumb and forefinger but either ended up with a thumb right in the middle of whatever I was watching or a hand cramp.Real estate: getting smaller means text is smaller especially on we pages In portrait mode. You can set the text size up for dynamic type but it doesn't work everywhere and when if does work and you change to landscape, then the text is far too big for the screen. Furthermore, in games where part of the screen is used for the controls I ended up wishing for a larger screen.Keyboard: the keyboard ended up being the main reason I went for the Air. While it is surprisingly good on the mini (really it blew me away how good the keyboard was in the mini) typing at that size for any extended period is taxing and it just can't compete with the Air if you plan on writing any amount. Furthermore, using the GarageBand keyboards are fairly awkward on the smaller screen. Unlike the accessory keyboards for the full size iPads, I found the external keyboards for the mini were actually much much worse than the onscreen keyboard.Pocketability: the mini fit quite nicely into a jacket pocket, in the climate where I live jackets are only really feasible about 3 or 4 months out of the year. Other than that it needs bag of some sort, which is really the same situation I'd be in with an Air.Weight: this made the choice the hardest. Holding the iPad mini feels like hardly anything at all. The iPad air feels considerably heavier. That affects everything you do with the tablet and the entire interaction with it. Fortunately it's mostly a matter of perspective. Put down the mini for a day and all of a sudden the air seems  quite light.For me the decision was made for the larger version but what about options?Cellular of no cellular? The free 3G on my kindle touch has gotten me out of a scrape more than once and having access to a no-strings-attached internet connection is guaranteed to come in handy at least once during the lifetime of your tablet. $130 is a lot to spend though, especially if you have a smart phone and free tethering on your plan. Originally I went for the wifi version for precisely this reason. However, the ability to tether is dependent on the carrier you happen to be using. Should you switch phones, carriers or plans or simply lose the phone while traveling tethering May no longer be a option and it's never going to be as convenient as simply opening the settings on your iPad and activating a plan. In addition you also gain the ability to use gps with a cellular modem and gain the benefits of enhanced find my iPhone accuracy in the event that it's stolen and the thieves know enough to keep it off wifi. Finally though, the possibility of a free 200 mb per month with t-mobile and the ability to switch carriers at will ended up pushing me to get the cellular version.So, after having initially been interested by the mini, a lot  of research, even more indecision and having bought, lived with and sold multiple versions of this thing I can safely say that the iPad Air with cellular is the  version I'd pick. If you don't plan on typing a lot with it though or watching movies, go for the mini.", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "First Ever Apple Product - First Ever iPad - LOVE IT", "Author": "JoHarley", "ReviewID": "R1X2GEOQACNWD2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The has become a great tool for my photography needs. I got it around mid November so I haven\u2019t had it that long. I've been tired of carrying a laptop when going on a trip which I used to download daily the photos taken that day. Thought I\u2019d give the iPad a try.Pros:- It\u2019s super light in weight which makes it ideal for carrying.- It\u2019s fast. Apps run very nicely.- Great camera and photo tools.- Beautiful screen! Photos look super nice on display.Cons:- BIG, BIG CON! You can\u2019t connect an external, off the shelf, drive to it for backing up my photos. Ended up spending twice the money for the Seagate Wireless Plus, 1 TB. It took a bit of setting up but it does do the job. BUT STILL! Why on earth can\u2019t I simply connect a $70 one TB drive to the unit?? Seems a bit petty to me.- Connectors costs a bundle! I needed an SD card reader, an HDMI connector for streaming video to TVs in hotels, and a Micro SD connector  for my smart phone and other devices. The HDMI connector itself was $50.00. This thing probably cost $0.50 to make, but I WAS warned  about Apple\u2019s marketing tactics\u2026- The manual leaves a bit to be desired. I\u2019ve learned more from friends then I have from their manual. Ended up with the book \u201cMy iPad\u201d for Que. Good book\u2026Still got some learning to do with this device but it has been fun to figure out.

First, try to buy the product through Amazon.  If you get lucky you will avoid 38+ dollars in taxes.  In my state I get charged that anyway.  I bought mine a few weeks ago and I now regret my decision.The ipad Air, full size not the mini, is expensive for what you get.  The much talked about retina display really isn\u2019t much better than Apple\u2019s or Samsung\u2019s normal display.  I take a lot of photos and even at full zoom I can\u2019t make out much difference.  The Apple ipad Air does NOT come with an SD card slot, and if you want to upgrade from 16gb to 32gb you will be looking at over $100 additional dollars.  Many of Apple\u2019s competitors have the SD slot and cost less.Apple sells an SD card \u201creader.\u201d  You can download from the card to the ipad but NOT the other way.  And the ipad SD card reader will run you $30 plus dollars.  You must buy other $30+ dollar accessories if you want to use a USB memory stick for example.  I purchased a non- Apple SD card triple reader (USB and SD for example) for about $9 dollars.  The machine complains at me but it still works (but, once again, it only loads to the machine not from the ipad as a normal SD slot does).An SD card reader would have been easy to install as part of the iPad, and this gives their competitors an edge, especially when one is taking photographs and trying to download them immediately to examine on something other than a 2 inch screen.  As I shoot RAW (large files) photos with my Canon this inability to use an SD card is a real pain.Downloading music from Amazon to iTunes isn\u2019t any picnic either.  My wife has an android device from Dell running Jellybean and she downloads everything with zero problems.  Plus, she has an SD card slot which really helps.  Her screen is as sharp as mine.Finally, the OS systems.  Jellybean has about a million apps written for it while I have about 200 - or that is how it seems to me.  Her system is faster than mine AND her system is intuitive and mine is not.  I\u2019ve had to read over the Apple manual for ipad three times trying to get things done.  Maybe my largest gripe is I bought the Apple thinking several Apple machines could sync up and trade information easily including photographs and music and documents.  Wrong.  I\u2019ve tried numerous syncing ideas and none of them work.  I started using Pages (an Apple word processing program) instead to Word to get it to transfer.  Finally, I saved it to the cloud and managed to get the document to the other machine.  Photographs that are in the photo stream do transfer; however, getting the photograph into the stream when it was not automatically placed there by the ipad doesn\u2019t work.  And finding photos to look at in the ipad, when the ipad did not take the photo and the photo is on another machine (with the photo stream on and home sharing on) the photo still does not come up.  Very frustrating.After using the ipad and watching and using Jellybean and Android in action I think the Android devices are a much better deal.  Get one with an SD card slot.  I am certain Apple has designed their machine so the user cannot get extra storage on the machine (as an SD slot would allow) and must buy a more expensive machine if they handle large files.  If you like buying music at Amazon good luck getting it to iTunes onto your machine if it is an Apple (Yes, I have Amazon cloud player).  My wife got her music downloaded in about a minute.  It took me an hour to get one of Mozart\u2019s songs I had purchased downloaded to my computer.In retrospect, since the programs do NOT sync up as advertised, the machine has little storage unless you pay an enormous additional price, the retina display is not revolutionary, and the number of programs are minimal compared to Android I wish I had purchased an Android.  Samsung seems to be on the cutting edge there, although my wife\u2019s Dell is performing just fine.", "Date": "February 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Apple iPad Air", "Author": "Oscar Crumby", "ReviewID": "R1LFVGKI48DRB6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I would recommend this product to anyone that is looking for a tablet.

I purchased the iPad Air with T-Mobile service directly from Apple, and when I try to set up my account, it informs me that \"my zip code is not valid\". (It's 95482, which is Ukiah, California, and from the connection indicator on the screen, we do seem to have 4G service here.) I spent 45 minutes on the phone with T-Mobile support to try to resolve this and was informed that I had to spend $10 on a new SIM card, which I did. On receiving the new card, the problem was not resolved. I called support again, and was shuttled from one line to another and finally disconnected. Nobody seemed to know what was going on or how to help me.This is really annoying. I'm a professional software engineer and have a lot of experience with mobile devices, and have never had to deal with this kind of runaround before.Add to that the fact that Safari crashes about once per hour, and I have to say this device is a big, expensive dud.
