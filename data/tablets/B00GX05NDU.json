{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Worthy tablet with great quality and service", "Author": "James62", "ReviewID": "R84PZPM2Y43GI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I found this and purchased it because it say free game and office app bundle included. And yes the apps are amazing.First of all, this tablet runs smoothly and surprised me because I did not expect such a good performance base on the price. I thought this would be a good play tool for my 5 year old son. It exceeds my expectation. I end up finding it to be a good little tablet that I can carry around dealing with emails, news, videos so I bought another one for myself. I think the dual core processor they call iMAPx15 must be doing its job well.The dual camera, on the other side, is not very impressive. However, I am not dumb to expect it to be perfect. I did some video chatting and this N7 is compatible with Skype. Since the image quality is usually not very sharp though Skype, I do think their camera resolution is good enough for this task, if you want to use it as a real camera and take vivid photos, go find something more expensive.Screen resolution is perfect for a 7\u201d. HD screen and slim design makes this tablet my current portable video streaming buddy. Holding this table in my hand seems to be comfortable cause the light weight. Sure it is a cheap tablet and it doesn't feature splendid sharp colorful retina screen, but I can connect it to my flat TV through HDMI port and yes, it worked, with all the sharpness I need. Tips, you need a mini HDMI to normal HDMI cable if you want to do this, it costs like $20 on Amazon, also keep it charged if you use the HDMI port as it is kind of battery straining.Battery life is a so-so on this N7, be smart and prepare a portable battery if you need to play with it longer than 7 hours. I use it occasionally and put it away every day, it can charge through USB port so I do not need to bring the DC wall charger. I mean, even an iPhone5 cannot last for a whole day so you know what Im taking about.Now is the best thing I love for this tablet \u2013 the apps. Apps are not pre-installed, don\u2019t know why, but you can go online and register on neutab\u2019s website with your code that come in the box. They will give you a choice to download either of the two app packages. \u201cGames bundle\u201d or \u201cOffice bundle\u201d, they claim it to be worthy. All I care is if I can get something useful and wow, those apps are fantastic. For my son, I really like the kids mode app. It has lots of fantastic functions and it is the best educational app I ever seen. There are games too if you like playing games. I took office bundle for my tablet, which really gives me everything I need. PDF reader, office documents editor, file manager, desktop remote control etc. I really think this is a good move because it saves money and time to look for the right app.So far this Neutab N7 has been a satisfying choice. Don\u2019t know if it can last like this, I will keep updating my review. I recommend this tablet to those who doesn't need to have this tablet as a fantastic multi-tasker. Also, if you want a tablet for your kid, this is it.", "Date": "January 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "The Good, The bad, and the Ugly", "Author": "Richard Fletcher", "ReviewID": "R9B2S63VN6KSS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this for Christmas. My wife bought it on Dec 8th. The tablet is great for the price. Just don't expect GPS, a great camera,It worked great for about 20 days untill it just quit coming on. Of course I missed the 30 day return policy of Amazon. Now I can not get in touch with NeuTab.... before it quit I gave it 5 stars... now well what do you think.UPDATE  !!!

I love it mainly because you can attach it to your LED TV and watch videos.  It was easy to get connected to the wireless at the house and other places as well.  The one thing we both do not like about this tablet is the camera.  It does not deal with motion very well.  If the object is still, the photos and video are great.  We were trying to take pictures and video at a basketball game, so you know being still does not happen there.  This device is overall great!

It has total 4 GB storage. After installing bunch of applications, I still had available 2 GB. This runs Android Jellybean. I did not face any issue at all out of the box and have been using for days with no issues. Obviously you should know the feature set and use within the limit. I will go into the specifications and review based on my user experience. I had no hardware or hang issues with this tablet.The iMAPx15 dual core CPU is very efficient and it has done a good job to extend the battery life. There is a built-in 2800 mAh Rechargeable Lithium Battery. Battery came for a good 6 hours with moderate usage. Battery usage really depends on how heavy you use the system. Overnight it drained very less. I usually turn WiFi off as I play games so save some power.Notice there is a layer of screen protector on the screen. Remove it before using so you won't see bubbles and experience touching sensitive problems. The capacitive touch screen was really good, some occasions I had to press little harder and at right locations, but pinch-zoom, highlight, Copy-Paste all worked very well.The screen is 1024 x 600 Pixels and it over-matches other similar tablets. Tablet has 2 cameras. The tablet has micro USB Port, 3.5-mm stereo Headphone Jack, built-in speaker, microphone, micro SD card slot and a DC Input Jack. Note that for powering through wall adapter you need to use the provided DC input jack. Speaker was loud enough for me. HDMI interface is also good for connecting to HDTVs.Android tablets are really customizable to your heart's content. It is here where NeuTab shines. Using a native Android Jellybean, they have achieved something at a low cost. This can have a very wide reaching audience. Affordability is key, a tablet like this with Wi-Fi is a big boon. Imagine having entire Wikipedia at your fingertips for a child. I tried few educational applications on this. I consider this as a big hit with educators than gamers.I tried Google Voice Search. I was asking about the scores of current playing games, weather and etc. The voice recognition part was great and it was able to recognize and dictate the answer. Apps like Calculator, Gmail performed flawlessly.The engineering for the price/value/budget that N7 delivers is perfect. NeuTab has pulled components and assembled at a terrific value. I was particularly interested how it performs to streaming video. I watched multiple videos and streamed online, none gives me any trouble. I recommend buying.", "Date": "April 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Don't Expect Much", "Author": "M.B", "ReviewID": "RITABE94NTS5Y", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Don't expect to get much out of this tablet. If you have a child with no patience than I suggest spending a few more dollars on something better. It says Dual Core, but its about as fast as computer from the 1980's.

I was hoping I could play my android versions of Grand Theft Auto on it, and they take around 1+ GB of internal storage to play on a tablet.  I've played it on my phone with no problem but wanted a big picture for more accessibility.  Well, when Neutab said it had a 4GB hard drive, it was very misleading.  After all the preinstalled apps and whatnot is accounted for, only about a little less than 1 GB max was available to save game data to, so I was not able to play any of my Grand Theft Auto games because of lack of hard drive space.  Could not figure out how to get more space.  Some of my apps like SongPop and MoviePop will freeze during play and a message will pop up saying it has stopped responding and asking if I want to close.  The battery drains at what seems like 1% a minute when WiFi is connected.  The auto rotate messed up in the first 5 minutes and would not stay at regular landscape so I had to turn it off.THE GOOD:It switches decently enough from app to app, browses internet at decent speeds.  I'm able to play Crazy Taxi flawlessly on this tablet.  It has a good battery life and charges very quickly as long as you don't have WiFi on.  Plays my movies and music very well.I would recommend this tablet for anyone wanting to play some simple games or browse the internet for things like facebook or email, pretty much a beginner's tablet.

This tablet is going to benefit  someone who isn't looking to spend a ton of money  on a tablet.  The tablet can handle playing games, watching movies, and using the web.  You get about 6 hours in a single charge, which isn't the best.  In order to get the best view on the tablet. You have to have the tablet facing you.  Having the tablet tilting in a different directions makes it the screen harder to see.  The speakers on this tablet aren't the best, so I recommend using headphones.  The camera quality on this tablet is very  low.  Using the web is great as well as watching youtube videos. Games load and play without having any problems. Over all this is a great tablet if you are looking for a low cost tablet.Pro:SmallLight weightEasy to usePriceCons:Screen resolution.CameraI was given this tablet as a gift", "Date": "March 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Gift from my boyfriend", "Author": "Makayla", "ReviewID": "R11N80P6J0KCSR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My boyfriend got me this as a gift because i love to read and i buy alot of kindle books form amazon and i got it went thru direction booklet charged it like it said and i turned it on it immidiatly shut off and would not turn back on so i think it was defecftive from the factory i wasw really looking forward to using it but no such luck so i dont know what to do with it its sittin back in its box i feel like it would have been beyond worth the money......

I thought, no big deal cuz it was for my kids, they won't care. BUT after loading the games for my kids, both of them were very hot on the back, I thought well, maybe it was because I had them laying down on the couch while loading and the couldn't breathe... Then today we took a them with a fully charged battery for a 1.5hr ride. Both of the tablets were NOT in the cases that I had bought to store them, and still they got extremely hot and kept shutting off.  My daughters tablet shut off 7 times within the 1.5hrs.  We started our trip with fully charged batteries and both batteries didn't even last the whole 1.5hrs. the kids were only playing real basic games nothing graphically intense and never even had a movie on them.

From day one, charger runs extremely hot and does not even go all the way in the hole.  It turns off if you walk away for literally 30 seconds.

Right now, it won't even let me charge it.....it shows a red battery and keeps cutting off.  Don't even have the heart to tell my friend. I am on-line right now ordering my son something of better quality.  Would not recommend this to anyone, for any reason.

Now, maybe my unit is not representative of this brand or model, however, in my experience, it will not stay connected to my 50Mbps WiFi.

It's listed as a dual core processor, but it isn't as fast as another tablet I bought at the same time, also a dual core. That unit, a Double Power, model EM63 has no problem connecting to my WiFi, and is faster, however, while it's performance is up to spec, it doesn't have a camera on the back side.
