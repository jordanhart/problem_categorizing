Great addition even if you have an iPhone 4.", "Author": "AmazonDiva \"Keep Calm and Carry On.\"", "ReviewID": "R21L29HN1F0GC2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My primary reason to buy an iPad was both work and home use. At work I wanted to stop printing the powerpoint decks and reports to read, and just read them on an iPad in meetings/on the go. For home I was tired of not being able to get to all my magazines and never having them on me when I wanted to read them. I also wanted to watch some TV/movies in bed/around the home so that I did not have to switch on the big living room TV. The iPad 2 has been a perfect solution for all these and more. I'm kicking myself that I went with the lowest 16GB version as I find myself downloading more content and apps everyday! It's not a laptop/desktop replacement either at home or work, but it's a great media consumption device and more.I already used my iPhone 4 constantly due to the multitude of apps and games available for it. Fewer apps are available for iPad but it's still thousands, and I have already downloaded 200+ to try, most of them free.The hardware itself is very slick. Very light so you can hold it in one hand, especially if you use a cover - otherwise it tends to be slippery. But it's not so much about the hardware, which other reviews have detailed anyway. It's all about being able to do what you want to do with a device. With the best technology the device itself should disappear and allow you to create, read, connect - whatever it is you want to do. That's what iPad 2 is doing for me, like a netbook never could. Using it is so intuitive and seamless, that despite having the iPhone 4, I am amazed with how much more I can do to be productive. I regret not buying it sooner!Like the previous devices Apple has created the genius is in the apps available for it. The PressReader apps allows me to read newspapers and magazines from all over the world. I can now read some favorite magazines that were so difficult to get in the print version and newspapers too. Apps like the Flipboard and Zite make magazine content come alive. Favorite magazines like Bloomberg Businessweek and Wired are available free as iPad versions to print subscribers. Also, all news magazines are now featuring interactive content, so I'm reading the news article and looking at static images, and then just as easily click on a video to watch it. The Daily is a good interactive made for newspaper but I'm looking for even better interactive journalism!\"The Civil War\" shows us what history books of future should look like with its interactive content and a daily log of events as they happened 150 years ago. Netflix streams nicely and I can watch the content I want to that bore my family to tears - like documentaries. I also download all my PDF reading materials on it and can read and annotate and highlight. Powerpoints are so easy to read and I can scale the screen to look at the graphs better. iMovie is so simple to use, and I've already created several home movies with music and subtitles. GarageBand is great for novices like me, it has a multitude of instruments that I can play and even has smart versions to create music. With penultimate and UPad I've been trying to completely do away with paper notepads, but that's not the perfect solution yet.With apps like Dropbox and Box you can drop your files into the cloud and access them from your iPad. Chatting over FaceTime or over Webex is simple, although it's entirely dependent on bandwidth. With other apps you can access your remote desktop and use every program on your computer or pull any file. I am using TeamViewer which is free for individuals to log into my home PC from work and check my files or run some programs remotely. It shows you your PC screen on your iPad and you drag your finger to move the mouse cursor and click. It's pretty seamless once you set it up, as simple as opening the app. I opened it one day from work to see my kid watching Youtube and surprised her at dinner when she told me she had been doing home work (ha!).Another made for iPad app I use a lot is the Tivo Remote. When I turn it on it automatically shows the program I'm currently watching on the iPad screen with more details and upcoming episodes. I can use the remote buttons or explore like programs, set my season passes, etc. And when I'm not home I can use it to record programs remotely. Xfinity from Comcast also allows you to schedule and watch your onDemand content. HBO GO is simply a delight, I am thrilled to have all the HBO shows available to me anywhere I go!I have been reading much more since I got iPad 2. Especially blogs, magazines and newspapers. That alone makes it worth it for me. And it's SO much easier to stream content like TED Talks, Lectures from YouTube, movies from Crackle and Netflix. I would have never wanted to sit down with my heavy and hot laptop for such prolonged periods to watch this content. There are some fun games available too, and every day more apps get launched which make me wonder how did I manage without this before!Facetime has been fun too. There are Qik (from Skype) and Tango, and several other apps available that will let you do video chat but since Facetime is integrated with email, you can just click on a contact's name and choose to connect through FaceTime. I can not only check on my kid on video through this feature (all they need is an iPod Touch and wireless) but also connect with friends overseas for free. And I can click their pics while they're on the call with me. Again this feature is dependent on video quality but as a multi-tasking mom it's been great to be able to connect any time in video from work to home. My kid will be listening to music on her iPod Touch and my FaceTime call comes in - and we're off talking face to face. VLC Player has been a great app to watch .avi and other videos. I had slightly lower res version of a TV series in AVI format and the VLC player allowed me to watch it on iPad, I prefer that screen to my HP Pavilion 17 inch which has worse resolution and tends to get too hot in my lap anywayBattery life was a big surprise for me. Mine lasts 10-11 hours on the WiFi model with full usage. That is amazing, I never carry the charger as it goes 2 days without charging. Love it! None of my laptops can compare!The frustrations I experienced with the iPad 2 was its inability to play Flash, which will not come any time soon due to Steve Job's dislike of that technology. However, a genius of an app called iSwifter has found a way to run flash on iPad 2 and I have been using it to watch video on websites that have flash content. However, it's still not as seamless as I would like it to be! The other is a more seamless way to store and organize photos and files. I can do this through apps but why not make this more seamless. If I have to delete photos there should be a select all feature to delete a whole folder.If you're on the fence about buying an iPad 2 go ahead and make the leap, you won't regret it. If you already have an iPad then hold on for iPad 3 as this version gives you some enhancements (faster, improved graphics, thinner, cameras) but nothing that is so extraordinary that you can't wait another few months!", "Date": "April 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "I PAD 2 Initial Thoughts", "Author": "DGK", "ReviewID": "R63GIOHEGF2ME", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So I'm in the kitchen, listening to my music library, and typing a review for the I-Pad 2. I have put a little more than 14 hours of research and 6 hours of non-stop use. I'm not gonna waste my time writing the specs for this device because if you are reading this I assume you already know the specifications, if not you can easily access the Apple website and do your own research. This review is aimed more towards the educated consumer. A consumer, who like me, has spent various hours of the night researching and contemplating his or her next moves.First, I want to start off with the word \"tablet\", what is a tablet and who needs it? As an avid P.C. user, I tend to define the device as too short, too little. A underpowered, pre-mature device not ready for this day and age. The truth is, their are more people out there who need a tablet versus a laptop. Having a quad core, overclocked, power hungry P.C. I am like most other users; who tend to have a bias when selecting/comparing  portable products. I have been for some time; looking for a laptop with great battery life, portability and power? I first went out and purchased a Macbook pro for about $1199+ some. After a couple weeks of use I was in love. I could not stop showing it off and playing with it. Then I attempted to play games and yes they were playable! But I found myself running to my P.C. whenever I was gonna get serious and then I found myself using my desktop when editing videos. Yet again, I found myself running to my P.C. when it came to doing anything that involved time and effort... It was at this point that I realized that I never used my laptop for more than a hour. Utilizing a mere 20-40% of its power. I used it for; writing papers, showing off pictures and Internet browsing. So I decided to return it. In search for something that made sense.I never considered a net-book useful or even worthy of my time, even less a tablet. The Motorola Xoom came out and I thought it had potential compared to last years 256MB I-Pad. It offers 1GB of internal memory and 32GB of storage space, all for $599. It not only had the potential, but also the power I craved. Although, its pre-mature operating system was a deterrence. This is the same thing that turned me away from the original IPad. Dispite the fact that I liked the original, if people didn't demand it, the product would die and I would be left with a 500 dollar piece of silicon or waste. I needed something portable and practical. I just felt the tablet was a little more practical, if not more useful too because of its  portability and extended battery life. So I took the plunge and got the Ipad 2.First impressions didn't fall short; it was easy to set up, had a beautiful screen, and gorgeous aesthetics. While Apple boasts about its 60,000 app's, I'll tell you what, it's not enough (way better than android though). While you can download IPhone and ITouch apps; they are simply not the same (a 3.5inch app on a 9inch screen). Face Time also seems to be problem, since it cost money for all your friends who don't have an IPad 2 or new Macbook. Tango or Skype are excellent alternatives, but still only supported in a 3.5 inch window. Despite this, it has some killer apps (e.g gmail, calendar syncing, web browsing and etc). My favorite app is TeamViewer, which gives you remote access to your PC from anywhere. This app is simply amazing. I was able to install some programs to my PC from school! While It doesn't support flash, it plays almost every video stream I've seen from the web. Hey, that's all I needed anyways. So I can't complain, but all you flash gamers might.Now I found this whole \"touch-typing\" thing to be an exasperation. Since I am primarily using this product for note taking, its important I am as accurate as possible. Keys kept skipping and words kept missing. So I upgraded to the Apple-wireless-keyboard.. sigh. It was a well spent 69.00 dollars (cheaper models are available). I am able to control volume, brightness and music. Also makes my tablet feel more like a high end net-book. I want to talk a little bit more about writing. I bought this tablet with the intention of using google docs. Well it works, but you have use the mobile version, which has limited functionality. I tried switching to desktop editing, but it was horrendously slow and unworkable. As a matter of fact I'm writing this with google docs now. As long as you are not using bullet points or etc; you should be fine. I do notice some errors that result from a slow ping, so it's worth trying noting it happens. I could more easily recommend using apple's built in \"note-taker\". Its responsive, practical and free.As far as \"Air-Play\" goes, simply amazing. Kind of a pain to set up though. One really has to go into every setting in I-Tunes and mark share libraries under preferences and account profile. When the set up is complete, you simply log in with your I-pad and use the same mobile user name and you are good to go. Of course you have to keep your computer running the whole time unless you have a dedicated server of some sort. Air-paly grants you access to your music, videos and HD collection. which makes that whole HDMI out thing really convenient. Granted its only 720p, Ive never noticed a huge difference between 720 and 1080p Additionally stream times are relatively quick. Just keep in mind this depends a whole lot on your network. Which bring me to my next issue of storage. I honestly feel the only thing anyone needs on tablet is, pictures and apps. Unless you are going on a long trip; a couple movies. I am content and don't think I would ever need an I-Pad with more storage. As far as 3G goes, will its just that. A three year old bandwidth solution. If you can get a tethering plan instead, I would highly recommend it, as you can also transplant GPS automatically when tethering.All in all I'm really content I took the I-Pad 2 plunge. A dive, I really never saw myself taking or considering. Having an android phone and P.C.; it would seem like honeycomb would have made more sense; considering the attractive specs and all. None the less, the IPad 2 meets my draconian standards for 2011. Making any other device look over weight and under-spec'd. While the consensus of professional reviewers have voted the camera insufficient, I could honestly say it does what I need it to do, which is provide fun and entertainment. The rear HD camera is similar to the one installed on the new macbook pro models (2011 refresh). Other than that, I don't plan on taking high quality photos with the device. I might do future reviews with the camera though. check out my youtube channel for video reviews, just look up oceansidecreations.", "Date": "March 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Ipad 2 Wonderful Tablet When It Works! Sucks When It Does Not Work!", "Author": "C. Brunner", "ReviewID": "R3N4B4TF46X9JG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought an IPAD 2 64 gig 3g Verizon model the first week it came out. I bought it online. I received it 3 1/2 weeks later from china. It was amazing for the first 20 hours. The apps were so unbelievable. I have a touch, and it is so much better. On the second day, it started trying to shut down. The battery was at 80%. I tried shutting it off and could not. I called apple. I bought the extra care plan for 90 dollars so they are going to help me. Right? Wrong. The first representative we talked to had us restore it to the factory settings. It took 1 hour to download the 660 mg file. We then restored it to the factory settings. It started working perfectly. We were so happy. The problem was solved! I watched videos and played with it for hours. I ran the battery down and plugged it in overnight to charge. The next morning the problem was back in spades. It then started doing new things like flashing on and off. I went on the website and asked a specialist to call me again. She put me on hold. She was gone for a little while. When she came back, she said that I needed to mail it back to them to REPAIR it. I said What? I have the apple care plan and was told that you would send me a replacement. I have not even had this thing 2 days. She said that the other representative lied to me, and that she could not lie to me. I have 2 options. I can take it to the Apple Store (nearest one 165 miles away) or I can mail it and have it repaired and they will send the same one back to me. She made me an appointment at the store. I am driving the 165 miles to take it back. The second representative (a supervisor) told me that they would send me a replacement if I gave them a credit card and let them charge another 900 dollars for it. When they received the old one back, they would charge it back to me.I have had a kindle for years. The day I saw it on the Oprah show was the day I fell in love with it. I bought one the same day. The first kindle i received was great except the internet would not work. I called Amazon and they shipped me out a kindle the SAME DAY! I got it a couple of days later and loved it. It worked perfectly. I upgraded to a DX and have never had a problem.If you want to see a video of what it is doing, you can go to you tube and watch it. My username is caulret. I love Amazon and their amazing customer service!Edited 4-16-11I took it back to the Apple store. The people at the Plano Apple store were awesome. They did not want to give me my money back, but we negotiated with them and they ended up putting it back on our credit card with some creative measures. A more timid person would have had to take an apple gift card. This was all they said that they could do at first, but I held my ground.  I might buy this product again at a local Best Buy when they come available. If I decide to do that, I will edit this review.

Better Than a Netbook. Wish It Had Higher Resolution", "Author": "P. Colin McGraw \"AV, Computer & EnviroTech Nut\"", "ReviewID": "R17MLSR9WU45GC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The first iPad really defined the tablet market and while a trickle of competing tablets were released, none of them has matched the critical acclaim of the iPad 2. The consensus of CNET, Engadget and most other tech reviewers is that the Motorola Xoom is the closest competitor, but falls just short of iPad.This latest version of iPad sports a thinner design, front and back camera for casual filming and FaceTime/Skype video calls, a gyroscope, better speaker and, of course, a dual-core processor and 9x faster graphics capabilities. You still get the 10 hour battery life, but it's all wrapped up in a nicer package. That said, it doesn't seem drastically different than the original iPad and it feels like this version is simply an iPad with cameras, and the cameras don't perform especially well.Granted, the increased graphics capabilities do make a noticeable difference in the handful of games that take advantage of the increased speed (\"Infinity Blade\", \"Real Racing 2 HD\"), but most of the apps I use most frequently - e.g. CNN for iPad, Netflix, ABC Player, iTunes Video, iBooks, Pandora, SiriusXM, Apple Remote - don't feel like the user experience changed much beyond the increased volume coming from the speaker.My big disappointments with the iPad 2 are that the cameras aren't great, though that's forgivable since I'd use them mostly for video calling anyway, and that the screen didn't increase in resolution from the first generation iPad! I want my Retina display!However, overlooking the faults of the iPad 2, it's still the best tablet on the market, in my opinion.My kids love the educational apps (\"Monkey Preschool Lunchbox\", \"First Words Animals\", \"Shape Puzzle HD\", \"Talking Larry\", \"Peekaboo Barn\" and \"Garage Band\" are all highly recommended), and I think they've gone a long way in teaching even my mildly autistic daughter memorization and puzzle solving skills!I also love that I can get paid content from apps lie Netflix, (Comcast) Xfinity TV and Hulu+ and even free content like on-demand \"Bachelor\" episodes and other shows from the free \"ABC Player\" app. There's just so much capability available to the device through apps and certainly, the wealth of apps available in the App Store is one of the iPad's biggest strengths vs. competitors!It's also a great device for checking email and casually surfing the web, as long as the site you view doesn't require Flash, which is still unsupported. I used to have a netbook that took 5 minutes to boot, then had an awkwardly small browser window and slow response, but you see nothing but instant-on capability and smooth navigation with iPad. I'd definitely prefer this tablet to a netbook!Also, a couple of other miscellaneous tips for those interested:1. The new magnetic Smart Cover from Apple is a must-try! The automatic wake and sleep on opening/closing the cover is more handy than you might first think, as is the ability to roll the cover into a stand for the iPad! We watched Netflix from bed while my wife nursed our baby recently, and it would have been a pain without the handy stand!2. If you buy an AirPort Express or Apple TV, you can wirelessly stream music (and video in the case of the Apple TV) to a remote set of speakers using AirPlay or the Apple Remote app! It's cool to be able to listen to my iTunes content from my kitchen with the iPad as remote control!3. If you're debating whether to buy the WiFi-only or the WiFi/3G iPad, it's worth noting that by paying for the WiFi hotspot capabilities on an iPhone 4, you can not only get data, but location services for your iPad 2, so you can save a couple hundred dollars on hardware and future-proof your connection speed since you can buy a new phone instead of a new iPad to take advantage of increased network speed.In summary, I highly recommend the iPad 2 if you're in the market for a tablet. Its apps are highly entertaining, portable and easy/quick to launch a play, and it just may change the way you surf the web and check email! Even your kids will love it!The few innovations this model sports aren't what they could have been, but are nonetheless compelling.", "Date": "March 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Something to keep in mind about capacity.", "Author": "Mike-l", "ReviewID": "RN3TT7N4E9AWW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When choosing which capacity iPad to buy, you should be aware of the following:For many users, this 16GB iPad will be a great choice because, although you cannot expand its capacity, you can import files \"on-the-go\" with the following Apple accessory: the Apple Camera Connection KitYou can use the Apple Camera Connection Kit (the SD card reader part) to import media files directly into your iPad, without the need to sync to iTunes.This means you can bring along with you an almost unlimited number of media files, such as movies, mp3's, and photos.Perfect for a long trip, etc. Why not take along 100 GB or more? Fantastic!There are a few details you need to know to import media files this way.1). Create a folder on any SD card and name that folder \"DCIM\".2). Place media files into the DCIM folder.3). Important: The media file names have to be exactly 8 characters long (no more, no less), or the iPad will not see them.Examples: 8letters.mp3, 8numbers.jpg, 8Numbers.mp4, TheBirds.mp4, Img_9001.bmp.Those are really the main details, but here are a few more:When you insert the Card Reader (one of two devices in the kit) into the iPad, with an SD card in it, in a moment the iPad screen will show thumbnails of all the media files on the card.You can import some or all into the iPad. You cannot play media files from the card, you must first import them. To select some media files, just touch them to highlight them and choose \"Import\". Or, you can select \"Import All\".The iPad will ask if you want to Keep or Delete (on the card). Be careful to select Keep (in most cases).Valid video files need to be in the \".MP4\" format, version H.264. Or convert them to that format using almost any conversion program. I chose a size of 640 x 480, and it was perfect for filling up the screen.NOTE: the media files are imported into the \"Photo\" section of your iPad. Even the MP3's and Videos. So, to watch a movie, for example, select the Photo icon, not the Video icon on your screen (it won't be in the Video section).AND, you can delete any media files after playing them. That way, you can, for example, load a movie or two into the iPad, watch, then delete to make room for others.", "Date": "August 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wifi problems", "Author": "A.

Two weeks later I'm kind of disappointed.I have had a couple of issues with this device, biggest one being serious issues with wifi connectivity. Apparently this has been a common issue for ipad 2. I found a fix for mine, which is to say its not complete junk, but definitely an inconvenience to go through all the steps again and again to fix it. The other issue is I keep having audio problems...sometimes when muted it cant unmute itself and I have to restart it in order to get my audio working again. The camera picture quality is not great, in fact its useless. The video quality is decent in good lighting, very usable if you can really see yourself taking video with a 10 inch tablet. The device isnt heavy for me, but my older mother found it heavy for her to hold after only using it for 5 minutes, which is why I would also recommend getting the smart cover for it..it can turn into some pretty useful sturdy positions for typing, reading, or watching video.The positives of this device, I was surprised at how great the screen would be. I thought it would scratch easy or be high maintenance...but its been really easy to keep clean with a small microfiber cloth (not included). Apps load fast, graphics are nice, and perfect for netbook replacement as long as you dont do a ton of typing. Its great for social media and web browsing, but i would NOT use this as an ebook reader, your eyes start to hurt after reading for awhile.

Mullins \"Digital Rebel\"", "ReviewID": "R30YM9QE8I36W1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Apple markets this as the ultimate portable computer product, but it has serious shortcomings similar to the iPhone that I wasn't aware of as I don't own one.  If you have no interest in external files or photos, then this may not be important to you.  I waited a month for mine to be delivered, and after a week, I can say I'm keenly disappointed for specific reasons of Apple's own making.You can't transfer ANY file to it, you can only SYNC all files from one designated computer, i.e. tethered.Despite reading enormous reviews & comments about the original, as well as the 2, I never got the impression from anyone that this was the case.  There were a few rumblings about \"file handling\" and workarounds for it [\"everything's going to the cloud anyway\" \"just use dropbox\"] - but nothing that says what an incredible restriction it is for anyone using photos/movies at all.  Their only official solution is that you buy a $40 dongle that then will allow SD card content [no CF cards, which I have]  to be transferred directly.  But the worst part is that even if you were to transfer anything to it, it all gets dumped at the bottom of  \"saved photos\" without any file separation, and no ability to separate or make collections of them after transfer either.Unlike my iPods, you can NEVER transfer any existing file to another, or create a new one.  Only with Sync.  Apparently they want you to work \"with the app\" to do whatever you want to do.  So the only way you could store photos is randomly, unless you want to sync all file/photos from your one mothership computer.  The only semi-solution is to email yourself whatever you want, then download the photos/files...which again will only be dumped in the \"saved photo\" generic file.  You can imagine the limitations with original file sizes.Another key element to me is the lack of any tabbed browsing, whether in Safari or the special Bing app for the iPad [superior to Safari for most things].  So to actually write an email, while constantly switching between single browser pages etc. I'd find ridiculously cumbersome, not to mention that you can't resize ANY windows/apps at all.  You can only resize font/content within a given page.Which brings me to the keyboard, or lack thereof.  I had no idea that the numeric/symbol part of the keyboard is ALWAYS separate from the alpha part, meaning that if you're ever entering alpha/numeric content, i.e. passwords, airline record #'s etc. you have to hit one key to show the number part, hit the number/symbol, then hit another key to reveal the alpha part again, and back and forth endlessly.  In addition, because there's no real tactile feel for the keys, and because the entry points are different for every program [where the browser bar is vs input for youtube etc] you're staring at the keyboard to make sure your fingers are in the right place, then having to look back up and find where it's going, then back down etc., which not only slows the process, but can give you a headache from your neck bobbing up & down, as well as the different light/contrast levels for the keyboard vs the rest of the screen.Yes - I know that you can get a separate bluetooth keyboard, and that would solve some of it - but it also defeats some of the advantage of the form factor if you have to haul the 2 around everywhere you go.This doesn't even address any particular program you may want to work on - just the physical/OS realities of trying to work with it at all.Yes - scrolling through photos is very fast, and can be easily manipulated with your fingers.  Yes there are some very inventive apps out there that take advantage of finger-abilities, but what the finger giveth, it also taketh away when it comes to anything that requires content creation or precision.  I never expected it to do something like Photoshop, but to be this crippled wasn't in the cards either.This should be marketed to generic users not comfortable with computers, and iPhone users who are used to--and don't want anything more than what their iPhone will already do.  The geeks that have championed it should be dismissed for misleading everyone, as they will always find workarounds, and have multiple devices anyway [macbook air/pro/imac etc].  They could just as easily make an Android phone/tablet work for them.The strength of Apple is supposed to be it's user-friendliness, flexibility and support...with their advertising just teasing out a few of the myriad possibilities of the device.  In the iPad's case, I feel they did the opposite:  they oversold it's abilities, touting dual-core ships, 9x better graphics etc., when in fact none of that really matters at the only pace the interface allows.  [I got my mom a refurb original iPad, the first computer she can work - and there's little difference in most app performance]At the direction of my local Genius Bar & Store Manager, I went in search of an app that could help with photo file/transfer, but I queried one of the best reviewed, \"PhotoSync\" to be sure they responded:\"PhotoSync can only transfer photos to the save photos folder. This restriction is made by Apple unfortunately. Third party developers are not allowed to create albums in the camera roll, save photos in other locations than the saved photos folder, or to delete photo from the camera roll.  All these features Apple reserves completely for itself.  We hope that this will change one day in a newer iOS version but at this point it is the only thing we can offer (though we would like to offer more).\"That may be plenty for most others, but it's not for me.  I went back to see if I skipped parts of reviews that mentioned this, and no - i didn't.  Here's from Mossberg from WSJ...who runs down all the drawbacks, including poor-quality cameras etc., then says:\"there are two big omissions, one old and one new. The old one is that, like Apple's prior phones and tablets, the shiny new iPad 2 still won't play Adobe's Flash video in its built-in Web browser. This is a deliberate decision by Apple, and puts its devices at a disadvantage for some users when compared with Android tablets, which can play Flash, or say they will soon, albeit not always well.The other omission has to do with cellular data. The iPad 2 can't use, or be upgraded to use, the new, faster 4G cellular-data networks being rolled out.\"NO mention of any of the aspects that are important to me, and I would think to a substantial number of people...even if we aren't a majority.I want it to be the Next Big Thing - the one that replaces laptops with a smaller, more flexible form factor that's also inspiring to use.I'm just left with the deflated feeling that I've been had, and mostly because of some very dumb and ridiculous failures in their OS that don't have to be that way...just sticking a finger in my eye as a dedicated Mac user.**Update** I got the 11\" Macbook Air and am very happy with it - although it is a lot more computer power than I needed in pure portable terms -  it isn't substantially bigger than the iPad [especially with keyboard] for those of you that can afford it.", "Date": "April 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "First time owner, perfect.", "Author": "Jones102", "ReviewID": "R2ZWEC39TBC80T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Not previously owning an iPad I did not know what to expect purchasing the iPad 2.

Its not happening, functions are too poor, touch screen keyboard is not tactile enough to use for any real typing, Safari browser is cumbersome to use, can't read the screen in even normal daylight so doesn't replace my e reader at all. No real spreadsheet functions or presentation modes. Too clumsy to take noes on.  The only things it replaces laptop for are movies or videos and even then the battery life is pretty poor. As far as I can tell I really got sucked into buying one from the hype. On the other hand I use my smartphone (iPhone) constantly and it also replaced my mp3 for traveling.

Since there is no way to separate the service you get with this device, and the device itself (and once you get this particular model of iPad, you are most likely to be using AT&T; (T-mobile is slower)), this device gets a really unfair rating from me.  Go look at the Verizon version.The good:Easy to use, light, rugged.  Great apps.  The software and apps just \"seems to work\" as compared to the two Droid phones I've owned, which crash, do weird things, are sluggish when first turned on, etc. etc.  Based on this, I would not recommend an Android tablet to anyone except the most Technoholic Open Source types.The bad: (blame AT&T;, and spineless government oversight)I bought this because I would like to use it if I ever go overseas.  Since Verizon chose to go it alone with CDMA, and the regulators let them do that, you are stuck  in their little prison if you want to switch carriers....So I was told by Apple that the data service would be easily turned on and off like a faucet, and that I would only have to pay for the months for which service was enabled.  Great!  I buy it in December, immediately use it \"off-campus\" in Albany on Christmas vacation (no internet at my Dad's if you can believe it...)Sometime during Dec/Jan, I call AT&T; to get them to help me figure out why I can not get in to the Settings->Cellular Data->My Account feature.  First call was probably 15-20 minutes long, and the AT&T; representative is clueless.  It was like I was asking for help with my Acme Moon Lander.  I suspect it would have been news to the rep that AT&T; actually has millions of iPad customers who pay them monthly.  In fact enough customers that AT&T; should be able to escalate to iPad expert reps.Call two: Again 15-20 minutes, this time the rep is much more adamant that this must be an apple screen (though he could not explain why the AT&T; death-star logo was on the screen I was having trouble with.)Just to play along, I call Apple, and waste some of their money and more of my time.  They quickly confirm this is not their problem.I finally figure out although it would be a nice-to-have to check my account out this way, I can go to their web site, and log in.  It takes me a surprisingly long time (about 20 minutes) to figure out how to \"suspend\" my service.  By this time, I've waited much too long, and I'm going to have to pay them for January, even though I had not used it then.OK, I pay my bills, and now I get a new bill for Mar 25 thru Apr 25.  Whot?  My service is suspended, why are they still billing me?Now the reason for the dud star: I call AT&T;, and get Rep one.  They are very nice, and explain that even though I have suspended my service, I still have to pay.  What I really wanted to do is cancel my service.  Huh?  This is not sounding too much like a faucet anymore.  She suggests that what I REALLY want is what she calls \"Session based\" service.  She can not do that for me, but she will connect me with someone who will.I get put on hold where a recording LOUDLY tries to sell me a new Samsung tablet, repeatedly tells me I can  \"Re-think the Possible\" with AT&T.;  Let me tell you, I've starting to rethink how badly customer service can possibly be at this time.  ....Oh yeah, and there is something in there about not wasting my time too.Rep number two:  I recount my tale of woe,  but she will not have any of it.  First of all, I better get it straight: she does not know where this \"Session based\" phrase I'm throwing around came from, but I better get it straight.  Its called pre-paid, and we will hence-forth ONLY call it pre-paid, so we both know what we are talking about.  OK lady, you're the boss, Pre-paid.  How do I switch my account to Pre-paid, and how do I get this bill cancelled?  Well it turns out they can not just flip a software switch on their end.  The type of service (let's just call it a billing plan) is determined by my SIM card.  You've got that right: even though it is just a stupid serial number in a database, I've got to haul myself down to an Apple or AT&T; store to get a new SIM card, so that they can bill me differently.Apparently WAY back when, when I first signed up with AT&T; (which I think I did on the phone because the web site was too confusing), THAT is when I went off the rails.  That is why my Settings->Cellular Data->My Account feature gives me a weird error which three different AT&T; reps have not been able to help me with.  This woman was annoyed with me, and clearly thought it was all my fault for getting myself in to this predicament.  ....But she could not give me help with my bill.  Onward:More annoying \"commercials\":  you know if this Rep loudly read the scripts from these commercials while we waited for the next rep, it would be considered really rude, and nobody would put up with it.  Give me the elevator music please.  I am not calling AT$T because I've got money burning holes in all of my pockets to buy another tablet, I am calling because they are not billing me the way I was promised.Rep number three: I again recount my tale of woe (more quickly this time, so I don't p*ss him off).  Since I'm now in to minute 30 of this call, and that last rep was really testy with me, I'm now asking them to forgive three months for service not consumed.Guess what?  I tell this guy I apparently should have signed myself up for Pre-paid service way back when, and that is why I am here now, and he says: \"Oh you mean Session-based service?\", and proceeds to use the \"Session-based\" term that Rep #2 reprimanded me about for the rest of the conversation.So AT&T;: you are just awful.  When I communicate with you, you use the term \"Phone Number\" when it is not a phone. And I can not make phone calls (or text as far as I know)  You allow me to suspend my service, but you still charge me the same money, whats that all about?  Your own people disagree on what terms should be used for the billing plans.  And we are not talking innocuous terms like \"pop\" vs. \"Soda\", because this is how I got in to this mess.  I signed up for the wrong service, and I suspect it is because your poor discipline with terminology.  And that original error message, why give me a mis-leading error, just put up a screen which say \"You have got a XXX plan, and this info is not available under that plan\".  Cancel/Suspend, Pre-Paid/Session-based. Phone Number/device number.  \"Invalid account\"/Wrong plan type.  Pathetic. And I mean pathetic, not ludicrous, or shameful, or awful.  Pathetic.", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Changed the way we homeschool!", "Author": "Terry \"tcinsatx@yahoodotcom\"", "ReviewID": "REBPBBOXGSJC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was given an iPad 2 for Mother's Day this year and it is truly one of the best gifts I've ever received! I have a large family, and every person here uses the iPad on a regular basis. It's been in use for the last 5+ months from morning until night and I am still delighted and amazed with it.I'd never personally owned a tablet before, or an Apple product, but we have multiple computers and all manner of electronic devices in our home and most people would consider me and my family to be techies. Because we have laptops and desktops and netbooks and smart phones, I didn't think that a tablet would particularly add to our level of connectivity or productivity. I was so wrong.Upon opening my iPad2, I was instantly struck by its thinness and its simplicity. There was just the tablet and a charger and a small, welcome pamphlet. I turned it on and it gracefully guided me through setting up my wireless connection. It offered me a tutorial, but I was too excited to bother with that. I was surfing the net within seconds because the interface is so intuitive.By now, there are loads of reviews that go into detail about the cameras and other hardware featured on the iPad2 so rather than bore you, I will focus on some of the real world ways this tablet has changed the way we do things in my home.As a homeschooling mother of a 9 year old, this tablet has made the best things about learning at home even better! The battery life is so good that we keep it with us all over the house. No need to worry about being near a power supply or booting up time or any of that. The iPad 2 is always connected, always ready. There are literally thousands of amazing apps, many of them free, that enrich my child's learning day. He is working on improving his handwriting and using an app that lets him write right on the screen! If he makes a mistake, it prompts him to try again until he gets the hang of it. Math, reading, journaling, science, anatomy, astronomy, geography, music - there's an app for that!Having the iPad2 has meant that whenever my son wonders about something or asks a question about something, we have the answers right in our hands. Remember when you didn't know how to spell a word or a definition in school? Remember how the teacher told you to go look it up? This is like that, only a thousand times better because there is no walk of shame past the whole class to the big dictionary. My son looks up things all day long just because he WANTS to!There are several exceptional music programs that feature an electronic keyboard. My favorite cost a couple of dollars and my boy is now playing music. It translates well, too, because I have a piano and he is able to play tunes he learned on the iPad on our full size piano.Of course, there are games, too. Lots of them. This has been a real boon when we go on road trips. Even though there is no wi-fi in the car, my son has loads of apps to keep him entertained until we reach our destination. No more asking \"are we there yet\"?I have a 15 month old granddaughter who is becoming very iPad saavy, too. It amazed me that even a young toddler quickly grasps the concept of icons and different apps doing different things. She actually knows how to turn it on and choose the correct folder to find the Fruit Ninja app and successfully launch it and play! There are several other games she enjoys, as well as some delightful alphabet games and story book apps. She also enjoys having us take video of her with the iPad and then play it back for her.I generally have it with me in the kitchen at meal times because I can look up a recipe and have it in front of me while cooking. Or I can watch a movie with the Netflix app while baking or preparing more complicated meals. If I didn't have a Kindle already, I would be using the Kindle app to read ebooks, too. Thanksgiving won't be nearly as tedious for me this year because of my iPad.I now take it with me when I travel instead of my laptop because it fits in my purse! I got a bluetooth keyboard to go with it so even when I need to type a lot, it's no problem (although the virtual keyboard is responsive and quicker to type on than you might think). I spent several days at a hospital with a friend and the iPad allowed us both to keep up with email, google for further medical info, and even watch a movie. I've discovered that there is wi-fi almost everywhere! (That's good because I didn't choose the 3G version.) My friend was so impressed that she bought an iPad as soon as she got home!Even though the device is almost fantastically thin and elegant, I would caution you to purchase and use a case all the time with your iPad. The screen is plenty tough but I have read many, many warnings about dropping it on one of it's corners, which results in the screen shattering. A case is good insurance and many of them feature the magnetic on/off, which conserves battery charge while protecting your iPad when you aren't using it.Other nice, but not essential, accessories are a protective screen film, a capacitive-style stylus, and an extra charger/car adapter. If you will be using your iPad as a replacement for a notebook on a regular basis, a wireless, bluetooth keyboard is nice, too. But other than a good case, the iPad2 needs nothing else to be up and running straight out of the box.Highly, highly recommended.", "Date": "September 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "WISH I BOUGHT A TABLET EARLIER.", "Author": "Harkanwar Anand", "ReviewID": "R3D8AOAY06VVE5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I thought about getting a tablet a hundred and seventy  eight times before finally buying one. I have a couple of laptops and a mac desktop so I wondered if I really need one. I know it isn't that expensive to own but then I also had 2 iPod Touches. So basically I was going to get the iPad 1 first but then they came out with the iPad 2, I waited several months and then like any man who hates indecision I decided to get a tablet. The choice was simple. I was used to the iPod Touch (4th generation) and thought this would possibly be similar. I was worried it would sit in one corner of my house. To clarify I never needed an iPad, what I did like however the most was the speaker on it. You see, i'm big on music and wanted something that can behave like a traveling jukebox. Besides watching a film when I'm on an airplane  won't be a bad idea either. I was sincerely considering getting the Samsung Galaxy 10.1 but then I knew this thing has been the best selling product of all time so I decided to get it anyway. I've had it for a little over a month now and in the following points i shall speak of the features, some unique and share my findings with you.UNIQUE FEATURES OF THE IPAD 2 -1. At 9.7 inches of diagonal length and brightness that is nothing short of being called exquisite one would imagine this thing to have an average battery or a good battery but the battery life is extraordinary. I use my iPad for a couple of hours daily and I must say that despite music playback, wireless data transferring to the iPad from my mac iTunes library, this thing lasts me for at least 5 days. This is remarkable. I can give you the best device in the world as a manufacturer but if the battery life isn't good what good is it to keep charging it. It does take a very long time to charge mind you which tells you that it's gonna last you a while. For some bizarre reason I like to charge this with my Mac. Charging using the wall outlet is slowly getting primitive.2. The speaker is amazing, it's loud and clear but you have to know where the speakers are placed and it's very important or else it will hamper your experience. Sometimes you have to hold it in your hands to make sure the sound output is ideal. Does it work well placing it on  a flat surface glass or  wood? Yes. What do I use the speaker for? iPod. At 16GB this is just about enough for me to carry a contemporary selection of music  and films with me. Does it sound good while browsing internet pages? Yes. Youtube is exhilarating to say the least. Also only selected Facebook videos will work because many are not available on mobile devices so if something doesn't run on your iPhone or android phone, it may not run on the iPad. Fair trade.3. There are two cameras, both are sub par for 2011 but if you're sitting in a dimly lit room and have washed your face, it may just somehow take a nice photo of you but I seldom take pictures from it. I like to record 30 second to 1 minute videos and email it directly to people. I always keep it connected with my wifi. This is really convenient and is a NEW WAY for me to keep in touch. I never did this with my mac or my iPhone. Also please note an interesting thing here, if your video is too long, your iPad tells you that you cannot send it owing to the large size. I have not gotten into the whole editing video and cutting it thing so what I then resort to is UPLOADING  IT DIRECTLY ON YOUTUBE. Great feature though quality is to be compromised slightly.4. The iPad 2 weighs less than the iPad 1 by a significant amount. This shall be reason enough for people to upgrade or maybe you guys can wait for the iPad 3 to come out in April next year (random estimate)5. While typing on the iPad is a breeze for \"novices\" and \"intermediates\" it is not ideal for a super fast expert typer. Having said that I don't use it much for typing. I am much faster on my phone than I am on the iPad. I have noticed i am able to type best when I am not holding the tablet in my hands and it is resting on a surface. Now I have installed a invisible shield for it because it liked to keep a daily account of fingerprints. Did I find an ideal one? No. I also use an invisible PLASTIGLASS thing for the back which I found on Amazon and found super amazing. The back is so smooth even with this accessory. I find the leather cases a little too pricey and there are several available but I find them kind of obstructing to the design of this iPad and a little cheap so I don't use.6. Great company on an airplane - While I am always fidgeting with this device when it's playing something, the device makes for great company on an airplane provided you have an \"mp4\" type file to play back on it. You can easily install it using iTunes. But if you have  an avi file or a divx file I don't know how to play them or transfer them. The iPad doesn't work as a USB STORAGE device so it won't show up on your finder (or my computer) when connected. There is no way for a user to save files by dragging and dropping. WHILE MANY ARGUE over the relevance of such storage, I believe the absence of it helps in keeping things organized and we all could do with a little less clutter. iTunes works beautifully for transferring stuff. I have noticed on all apple platforms (iPhone, iPod, iPad) that uploading a picture to Facebook involves more steps than on Android. Infact in certain cases Apple makes you buy an application to upload files to Facebook for the iPad. I find this cheek quite amusing but I take it with a pinch of humor. While playing back video you can tilt the device in any which way you want and the screen tilts that way. The video output is superior and the tilt  helps so it makes sure your fingers don't keep smacking into the headset jack when headphones are attached.7. Browsing - Yahoo looks utterly brilliant on the iPad. I love to go  once a day and simply look at their news features. Most search engines have specific websites for the tablets to access em and it looks super. My friend has a Xoom and he loves his tablet and is always talking about it but I see a sincere longing in him for an Apple iPad. The interface is unmatchable whether you are browsing, playing back a video or a song, the iPad wins. I do not use this as a task keeper so I don't bother with office utilities and all. Neither do I edit videos on the iPad but I believe there are inexpensive  solutions available. I read about them all the time on Macworld. Browsing on the internet, watching youtube videos, being on Facebook - it all seems flawless on the iPad. Much better than using a computer or an iPod or a phone. This is where the iPad truly shines. The font and the brightness I repeat is flawless and magical - nothing like i have seen in a dozen years of computers.8. TRANSFER - With the new ios 5.00  and iCloud I can actually send music, video, pictures to the iPad or play them back on my mac without connecting. Another big significant improvement. Now if only I could charge it wirelessly :)9. Are you thinking about getting the 32gb version? Don't. The 16gb is just fine  - for applications you won't need more. Multi-tasking is very easy and truly mastered on the iPad as opposed to the relevance on an iPod or iPhone courtesy of the big screen. Yes there is no flash support so I can't watch imdb trailers directly on the iPad. I have found applications which allow me to download music directly for free on the iPad - I am sure you will too. Netflix works flawlessly on this. I have put 740 songs on it and three films and have 35 applications installed but I still have 3GB remaining. After watching this film once I delete it to keep it free for another. This way you won't need a bigger iPad but if you do the difference is just $100 + Tax. I have also found that there exist many solutions for iPad users to wirelessly connect the iPad with a wireless storage hard drive. The expansion options are super. So take a look into that but I strongly advise getting just the basic  16gb version. I have a 64 gb iPhone and 64gb iPod so maybe I am so adamant on the uselessness of a higher storage iPad too.10. Miscallenous - It works with bluetooth, the iPad is light, unique for browsing, unique for youtube, ultra fast, multitasking is beautiful, you can play music or pandora while browsing, you can also switch the screen off and it will continue singing to you for several hours, the battery life does justice to it's perfections, the cameras are ok, i never Skype using it or i don't use FaceTime cause I don't know many people who do that. I like to carry it in my 13inch laptop case logic bag when I have to. I haven't dropped much water on it because i like it too much to be clumsy  with it. No headphones or instruction manual is  shipped. It took me roughly 30 minutes to set it up by connecting  with my mac.  It comes with a decent amount of charge so you can go 4 hours of playing around with it right out the box.I want you to look at all the above mentioned points and ask yourself if this is a notebook replacement? Obviously not. Because it has no physical keyboard, hdmi out, usb slot but if you are a casual browser, you can invest in this first and use it within the first 30 days to make your mind up. Apple is good that way. Overall - this is by far the best device i have ever used. It beats my iPod, iPhone, android phone, old blackberry, my mac desktop (close  2nd) , my ASUS laptop, my tv, my xbox, my blu ray player, my cameras and even my iron. Good luck.

We have one white 64GB WiFi/AT&T; 3G and one black 16GB WiFi.My family all pooled together to buy my son his iPad 2 (after they saw how he was responding to my 3G version).  Unlike many children with autism, my son has never been very computer or technologically inclined.  His interests have always been with physical and tangible objects and interests (not a bad thing, at all)... but we strongly suspected that the iPad touchscreen would change all of that.There are some remarkable apps for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) - some of which (fortunately) we don't need to use, since my son is very verbal.  That having been said - I have watched how the iPad is completely transforming the lives of his peers who are not very verbal.  Since this isn't a review of the apps, I won't write a whole book about the great apps - except to highlight three that perform really well on the iPad for my son:  1) the \"First Then\" schedule - you can use stock photos, photos you take, or grab them from Google images; 2) Stories2Learn where you can make your own social stories using photos you take; and \"Look in My Eyes\" a game that makes your child look squarely into the eyes of images of children (there is a secret number displayed) that needs to be entered on a next page to get \"prizes\".Okay - so now a review of the iPad itself...For the 64GB wifi/3G model - I swore I would only use it for my son and myself... that I wouldn't get sucked into using it for work (since I am the one who paid for it... right?).  Okay, well that plan lasted all of 3 minutes.  I have all of the attachments now: the VGA connector (used it yesterday to put maps up on the wall during a meeting using our projector); the HDMI connector (which is genius - since it has a 2nd port to provide power using your own AC adapter - and I use this at home and at work to plug into the TVs/LCD displays); the USB and SD Card reader (which imports my photos from my Nikon DSLRs); and my sister bought me the bluetooth keyboard (which I thought would be superfluous - but since I AM actually using this for work ALL OF THE TIME - it comes in very handy).  All of the Apple attachments work great.  Yesterday, I received a cheap non-Apple 2100 mAmp car charger from Amazon - and it works GREAT.  Charges, and I'm not afraid of my iPad battery frying!So, let me get to the two negatives - since that's why YOU are reading this review - right?  You want to figure out what is wrong with this thing... if anything.  The honest truth is that the cameras STINK!!!  Totally, and completely.  So, why give it a 5 star review, right?  The cameras WORK for the purpose that I wanted:  to use facetime to call my sister who lives overseas... and for that - it works passibly well.  Not in low light.  NEVER in low light.  So... I adjust.  Don't call Asia with the lights off!  Problem solved, solution found!  Trying to take photos with the front or back camera - also not great.  REALLY HORRIBLE in the low light conditions I just mentioned.  YET - when you take photos outside in the sunshine - they are actually quite decent.  I'm a photo snob, though - so nothing that didn't come from one of the Nikon DSLRs is suspect to me... DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU ARE HOPING THIS WILL REPLACE YOUR COMPACT DIGITAL CAMERA.  My Blackberry phone camera is a million times better - and I still think that THAT stinks.While I'm on the subject - let's talk about Facetime.  Apple - it's a great product.  I really love it.  HATE that I can't use it on my iMac at home unless I upgrade to Snow Leopard - which I have no intention of doing.  Glad my son now has his own iPad 2 so that I can call him when I'm at work or on the road... So others who are reading this understand - the Facetime App is a billion times better than the Skype app.  Apple made Facetime to work on their computers.  Period.  As such, it takes those not-so-great cameras I just mentioned, and maximizes their abilities and functionality.  If you can call someone Mac to Mac - use Facetime.What else don't I like:  the cost of all of those add ons I mentioned.  Seriously!?!?  My choice to buy them.  I will stop my rant.What I HATE:  the smartcover.  It's horrible.  Don't waste your money on the smart cover!  It's not smart.  I bought the orange - and it's already dirty in the ridges (remember I take this everywhere, and to work... and I work as a project engineering overseeing large dirty and messy job sites) - but the orange was already a sick creamsicle color, but it is just lame.  It doesn't always \"snap\" to the edge with the precision shown in the video commercial.  Just buy something else.  Or save your money.  I am waiting for the Otterbox Defender to come out - since I now realize how much I will travel with this.Everything else - I love.  The list is long, and I won't bore you.  As a child, I dreamed of such a device... and it meets almost all of my desires and wishes for a non-human user interface.  The AT&T; 3G is good enough, don't know if Verizon would have been better... I will always question my decision.  I can watch Netflix - but it doesn't hold coverage on my trainride... but then again, my cell phone from Verizon doesn't either.  There are lots of \"dead zones\" on my train ride to work.  When I'm stationary - in the woods, at a restaurant, in a store - the AT&T; signal is typically strong enough to handle the most demanding streaming.Visually, this object is a stunner.  Physically, this object is a winner:  it feels great in your hands, is responsive to the touch, and it makes everyone want one...I recommend that anyone who has time on their hands buy one.

If you're still debating between the iPad 1 and the iPad 2 check out my review of the first generation iPad right here on Amazon to see a discussion of its strengths and weaknesses with a number of people commenting (both positively and negatively) over the past 11 months.Let me begin by saying this upfront, I don't work for Apple, I don't own Apple Stock, and whether you buy an iPad, Xoom, a laptop or a pad of paper and pencil I don't get anything for writing this.  I'm not an Apple \"fanboy\" although I can give credit where credit is due and lately Apple has deserved a lot of credit for some of their products.Physical CharacteristicsThe iPad 2 is absurdly thin.  More importantly than it's thinness is its tapered edge which feels more natural in  your hand.  One of the biggest complaints about the original iPad was it really wasn't tremendously comfortable to hold for long periods at a time.  For a tablet device designed to be held, that's a pretty big deal.  Apple really has done an amazing job of cramming everything into an even smaller space than before and the difference is really noticeable when you're holding the device.  In addition to the tapered edge, Apple managed to reduce the overall weight of the iPad 2.  That might not seem like a huge deal to most, especially when you consider the weight difference isn't tremendous when you're already under 2 pounds, but I spend a good part of my day holding the iPad in my hands and the weight difference is surprising by the end of the day.  The first generation isn't heavy by any means, but the iPad 2 outshines it.New and \"Improved\"Apple doubled the RAM in the iPad 2 from 256MB to 512MB.  What does that mean?  For most casual users, probably not a whole lot.  There is a performance bump that everyone will see the effects of in things like loading times for webpages that are open in the background, but 256MB was sufficient for most daily use and games.  If you're planning to use your device for some of the more graphically intense games the iPad 2 does offer a better method of graphics processing that'll help deliver faster images with fewer jerky movements.  If you're just playing Angry birds and reading e-mail you're not going to know the difference.The screen is the same for all real purposes.  It is technically a \"new\" part in that it isn't identical to the old, it's a bit thinner and more efficient, but it's the same resolution.  The Glass is thinner though, and this amounts to a fair bit of the weight loss from one generation to the next.  In playing with the device it seems surprising but despite feeling lighter it actually feels more sturdy in your hands.  I still wouldn't suggest dropping it, but if it were to fall the iPad 2 certainly feels like it might stand a better chance to survive.  Try not to drop it though.The addition of 2 cameras was expected.  Some were a bit surprised to see the first generation released without the cameras.  Whether it was for a price point consideration, or a means to get people to upgrade, Apple held off until iPad 2.  The cameras do a reasonable job, but they're not going to replace a dedicated digital camera, or really even the camera on your phone for most still images.  The cameras do a substantially better job with video, and FaceTime is probably one of the best reasons to get the iPad 2 over the original iPad.  For those who might not be familiar, FaceTime is Apple's face to face conferencing system, kind of like Skype, or if you'd rather, kind of like the Jetson's TV/Phone.  With the push of a button you can be having a face to face chat with a loved one just about anywhere in the world (provided they're on a wireless network at the time).  FaceTime doesn't work over 3G natively (it can be used over a wifi connection created by a 3G device however) so you're not going to be able to use it in your car anytime soon.  This is probably a good thing though.  It is incredibly easy to use and if you know other people with an iPad 2, iPhone 4, or Mac it's a lot of fun.Smart Covers aren't really \"smart\" but they're really very useful.  Not only do they provide a stylistic enhancement of the device, but they serve a practical and functional purpose of doubling as a screen protector and stand in 2 configurations.  You can find them in a variety of colors and from third market suppliers, and it's a safe bet that more will be out soon to capitalize on the magnetic sensors in the iPad 2.  It's unfortunate that this same feature can't somehow be retrofitted to the iPad 1, I wouldn't have thought a case would be a compelling reason to consider a product over it's competitor, but these covers are really so useful it's hard to understand why they've not been there since the beginning.Multitasking SupportOne of the biggest knocks against the iPad when first released was the lack of native multi-tasking support.  Jailbreakers added the feature quickly and Apple soon realized it would be a requirement for any future device's success and released an OS update that included the feature.  The iPad 2 capitalizes on that progress and takes it a step further with the increased RAM enabling more open applications to be suspended at once, and the time to open or close an application has improved as well.  That said, even the first generation managed to open and close apps faster than most people would be used to on their computers, so while this is an improvement it's more akin to showing off.AppsOne thing that Apple has clearly the advantage in for the moment is app availability.  The App store has close to 70,000 iPad specific Apps, all of which will work on the iPad 2.  The new cameras will undoubtedly see this list expand rapidly, as will the inclusion of a gyroscope for gaming and motion based uses.  There are also a substantial number of professional applications ranging from document creation to photo editing and vector drawing.  Chances are if you can dream it, there's an App for that (and if not you might want to get started on one to fill in the gap).  The Android market is making a strong showing, and ultimately it'll likely be a strong competitor, for now it still has a ways to go, but any potential buyer should consider the strength of the application market before buying a tablet.Pros:Weight.  Seriously.  The minimal weight of this thing is by far the most impressive feature about it in my opinion.  It seems to defy physics and logic that so much could be in such a small space working that hard for that long.Battery Life.  From full to dead my iPad 2 went just over 11 hours with the movie Robin Hood showing twice during that time, the screen at half brightness, wifi turned on, an Angry Birds marathon and a good portion of a book in ibook.  That's better than a work day and that's constantly on.Books.  This is definitely a Pro, but reading itself could go either way.  The great benefit to the iPad is having access to Google Books, ibook, Nook, and Kindle.  This allows for some comparison shopping and price competition (although for the most part they're all usually about the same).  Reading in the evenings in bed is great as the back light means you don't have to worry about keeping others awake, but the glass screen causes some glare trouble when trying to read outside or near a sunny window.  If you're an avid outdoor reader the Kindle might still be your best bet.Cons:Still no dedicated USB support.  While there is a camera add-on that allows for certain USB devices to be used there is no option for mass storage.  Some of the Android Tablets allow for this and if you find yourself wanting to use your tablet as a standalone storage device this might be something to consider.  The device can read from certain flash drives though, but is largely limited to photo and video files.  Jailbreaks offer solutions to this, but those come with their own issues as well.Still no dedicated SD card slot.  This is troublesome on two fronts.  First, if you want to import pictures from your camera you have to have an adapter which is just one more thing to carry around.  Second, the lack of expansion means you're limited to what you purchase in terms of storage.  I purchased a 32GB iPad last time and never filled it up completely, so for me capacity wasn't an issue.  If you want to be able to have your entire movie collection with you though... you may want to consider whether the iPad 2 can meet your space requirements.HDMI output.  Really this is a Pro and a Con.  The iPad does allow for HD output over HDMI but again it requires an adapter.  All of these adapters are additional purchases for features that some tablets offer built in.  This can be a pain, but then again if you're not likely to ever use HDMI Output then you're not paying for something you won't use.No Flash Support.  This is becoming less and less of an issue as the internet and web developers are moving away from Flash for many websites, but there are a lot still out there relying on Adobe's Flash to run properly (including a lot of web based games).  Before you pick a tablet consider what kind of websites you frequent and try and determine if they are Flash driven or not.  If they are you may really want to consider something from the Android offerings as it is expected that they'll have at least some Flash support.If you're in the market for a tablet device the iPad 2 should definitely be on your short list.  If you're uncertain it is always best to go and play with these things hands on first if you can.  Best Buy is a good place for that, so are Verizon Stores since they have the Xoom and 3G iPad. Don't get pulled into the hype and mania that comes with an Apple release.  They're exciting and new, and they're impressive enough to warrant some excitement, but it will die down and there will be other products that prove a strong competitor to the iPad 2.  If you're looking for right now though, this is probably your best bet.  I gave the device 4 stars, as I did the iPad 1.  I did this in contemplation of the features offered by competitors that are absent from the iPad, most notably the requirement for adapters for USB/SD/HDMI.  While these features are there, they aren't as convenient as in other tablets.  With that in mind I firmly believe that the iPad more than makes up for this in usability, reliability, and design and in those areas far exceeds its current competitors.", "Date": "March 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "SuperPad for a preacher!", "Author": "J. A. Pape", "ReviewID": "R1YOKKMEYNDTIW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've postponed this review for a few months -- waiting to see how useful it would be after the newness wore off. So, the verdict is in:I put it in a black leather case and deliver sermons from it every week (written on a Mac and transferred to the iPad by \"Print to PDF\" at A5 size straight to a Dropbox folder, then transferred on the iPad from Dropbox to iBooks. It takes about 20 seconds). I prefer the iPad to printed sermon notes and wedding outlines because it's more easily hand-holdable, I can use a custom color scheme at no extra charge for ink, the print can be very large, I'm not wasting a bunch of paper, it's lighter, smaller, and more portable than a large-print Bible, and when talking to people after church I've got access to my calendar and address book so I can schedule appointments, get contact information, write reminders for that week's staff meeting, etc., -- all while standing in the foyer greeting members and visitors.I've also used it for presentations by connecting it to a vga projector input at the podium and utilizing the mirrored display. You aren't limited to Keynote for that although it does work well. But I've found it just as useful with iBooks, Bible software, and even YouTube player. The portability is fantastic -- disconnect the video adapter, slap the cover closed and walk away.Daily uses: mileage and expense tracking, keeping track of contacts, calendars & notes, video record-keeping, listening to Texas Rangers baseball broadcasts, web surfing, investment management, reading papers and books, and navigation. It's my favorite device for reading and responding to most emails.It can stand in for a computer in a pinch, which it had to recently when my laptop was put out of commission for a few days by a lightning strike. Using various apps most of the data I need on a daily basis is automatically synced wirelessly between the iPad, iPhone, and MBAir, so I still had my complete calendar and all my appointments (iCal/Google combo), access to all my email (IMAP gmail), all my notes (Evernote), vital documents (Dropbox), and the ability to research and write sermons, articles, and class presentations. It's capable enough that I can get by with leaving my laptop at the office most evenings. Yea!It's far more portable than even my MacBook Air. It's small and discrete enough to take into restaurants, tuck into the console in my car, and take into hospital waiting rooms without appearing insensitive to anxious family members. Instant on and off means you can pick it up to glance at the weather radar, or check an address, or take a note as easily as picking up an iPhone, but the size makes it much faster and easier to enter and view information. It's also large enough to share information with others around you.I use it daily and would replace it within a week if I lost it. 5 stars.", "Date": "August 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Pros & Cons + Defining the Difference between 16gb, 32gb, & 64gb", "Author": "goonius", "ReviewID": "R30F3IG6LX661G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After playing around an iPad2 in the Apple store, I did a little research, made the leap and bought one.Before I placed my order, I had a few questions about which one I should get: Black or white? Would 16gb be enough, or should I go for 64gb (since it's not like you can add memory to it later)? Or maybe I should take the moderate middle road and get 32gb? I had definitely decided on WiFi, not because 3G doesn't appeal, but because I don't need another monthly bill. What about the Apple-refurbished iPads? Are they as good as the new? Is there any tangible difference? If these are the same questions you have, I'll try to flesh out these answers in detail -- as well as what the iPad is good for -- and what it is decidedly not good for, and what a dedicated PC-user (like myself) should expect from a first-time Apple purchase.THE SPECS:So, Question #1: White or black? I was instantly enamored by the white. It was so... different. And that is the reason to go for white. Perhaps the only one. However, the reasons not to go for white outweigh this almost immediately: Primarily, the contrast of the white does in fact make the screen appear less bright and vibrant (I noted this in the Apple store) and there are reports of light-leakage. I went for black, and have no regrets.Question #2: What size? This was probably the question I spent the most time on, and I felt as if I couldn't get a really good answer for it. Some people seemed to find 16gb to be more than enough, while others said even 64gb wasn't enough. I almost bought the 16gb, but ended up compromising and getting a 32gb refurbished from Apple for the same price as the new 16gb. And I'm really glad I did, because I've already used more than the 14.4gb -- which is the usable space available one the 16gb.The 16gb, I've discovered, would have been ideal for someone only using apps and browsing the internet. Forget using it for music or movie storage, it's just not happening. On my iPad I have about 80 apps currently, consuming 5.6gb of space. Contrast that with the 1300 songs I have on there which are taking up about 8gb of space, and you'll see what I mean about 16gb being an apps-only device. So, if you already have an iPod, say, then it might make sense to get the 16gb.The 32gb is ideal for apps and storing a moderate music library, something I never would have anticipated using the iPad for -- but it turns out, I always have my iPad in my car, and find it much more convenient overall than my CDs. I've even gotten rid of an old stereo I used to play CDs on in the house. They're just kind of obsolete once you switch to storing tunes on an i-device.The 64gb, I imagine would be perfect for storing a little of everything: Music, movies and apps. I'm actually glad I didn't go for the 64gb, as I'm perfectly happy with YouTube or streaming Netflix for a nominal monthly fee (more on this in a moment).Question #3: Is a refurbished iPad as good as a new one? Although I don't have a new one to compare, I'm going to say yes -- with one minor caveat. The refurbished iPads have new glass, a new back cover, a new battery, the same 1 year warranty, and go through the same rounds of testing that a new iPad goes through (if you buy from Apple directly, of course). And when you think about it, why wouldn't this be just as good as getting a new iPad? After all, even a new one could have flaws that might become apparent in the first year of ownership. There aren't guarantees with any device, and when you can knock 20% off the price and make a vote for recycling electronics -- better for the Earth -- why not do it, right? Oh, and the caveat? There are a couple of times I have come across some settings that were clearly from the previous user which is... a little odd. Nonetheless the pros outweigh this, so far as I'm concerned.All, told, if I had it to buy over again, I'd make precisely the same choices as this time: Black, 32gb, wifi, refurbished. So, onto the device itself....__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________THE IPAD:This is my first i-device, and I have always been a PC (Windows) user in the past, so it's an entirely new experience to me. I bought it primarily because when laptop shopping I ended up getting a fantastic deal on this behemoth of a wide screen laptop. Not portable at all... so what about when I'm at the coffee shop or the bookstore and I want to tinker around, check my mail, Facebook, etc. Here's where the idea of getting an iPad came in for me. I wanted an easy-to-carry, reasonably-sized, aesthetically pleasing (and here's where the competing devices were blown out of the water) device to fill my portable computing needs.Interestingly, some of the things I initially bought the iPad for are the same areas where the iPad falls short. I knew there would be no flash capability, and so expected this. In truth, it's not been much of an issue, and YouTube is way better on the YouTube-dedicated iPad program than it is on my flash-enabled Windows 7 laptop. But its the simple demands that are over-complicated by the iPad. Email is a bit tedious. Like the way that you can only delete one item at a time, see one folder at a time, can't do certain things like 'star' an email to make the level of importance or permanently relegate something to a junk mail category. Note: This refers to the included email program, but even if you do your email through Safari there's going to be a lot of awkward pinch-zooming to awkwardly replace the awkward lack of functions in Apple's email program. Similar issues arise with the Facebook app: It's hard to see who's online, for one thing. I can't share a story from someone else's wall to my own, and most infuriatingly -- if I post a comment, and hit enter too soon (easy to do with the on-screen keyboard layout-- backspace and send are way too close to one another) I can find no way of deleting it -- aside from opening Facebook in a browser window and trying to navigate the too-small text and awkward formatting, when this should be a an obvious and simple maneuver on the iPad app for Facebook. This is true of many apps that replace simple browsing, from eBay to Amazon to social networking. Most are beautiful, well-laid out, and missing at least one (often more) necessary function. And speaking of function, while zooming is a simple task, cutting and pasting is beyond annoying -- so much so that I often say 'hell with it' and don't bother copying things I otherwise would have. Apple needs to overhaul that function.It is the aesthetic beauty of the iPad that rescues it from a lesser star rating based on the lack of functionality inherent in some its apps/programs. I tried the Kindle Fire in the store and found it to be visually lacking in comparison -- and much slower as well. Meanwhile, the iPad is lightening fast with just about any task you set forth to do. It makes my laptop with better specs look like a dinosaur in contrast. The screen is breathtakingly beautiful (and unless you're trying to close out lots of open apps, incredibly responsive). It's so fun to just look at that you will find yourself wanting to store a photo library on there just to view the pictures on it. I love having pictures of my kids to show off on here for the older relatives at family get-togethers. It's definitely better than a traditional photo album -- and that sentiment comes from someone who is rather old-fashioned about anti-technological items like physical photo albums. Side note: My 300 moderately-sized photos are only eating about .5g of space. Another side note: The camera, while not graphically amazing, takes some of the speediest photos I've encountered with a digital device.Just as the iPad is able to display unparalleled beauty with photos, its video display is equally amazing. Since I care little for large-screen televisions, watching movies on here has actually made me consider getting rid of our two televisions. Netflix is convenient, the resolution and sound are perfect, and although the selection for streaming is quite limited, it fills our equally limited television needs. I haven't watched a single show on the television since I received the iPad, but I have watched the entire first season of Downton Abbey -- at my own convenience -- which was quite a luxury.Lastly, the apps that are built *specifically* for the iPad: The games (like Contre Jour, Angry Birds, Cut the Rope), Garage Band, and Drawing Pad are awesome toys to have on hand --and affordable (as well they should be, considering the cost of the device itself). There are endless free apps to play around with, download, play with a bit and often delete -- occasionally saving the really exceptional ones. This is a great bonus to owning the iPad. My husband has an iPod touch, and the apps are far more interesting on the iPad.There are even a number of educational apps that I didn't expect. I'm not one for computing for kids in most instances, and we stay away from all that LeapFrog and VTech madness -- instead opting for books. But I've been so impressed with apps like Solar Walk and Star Walk that I've been willing to make an exception. They're magical, and present really difficult concepts like the universe in a understandable way.Despite the iPad having some glaring flaws, I would buy it again. I believe now -- as I did when I chose it -- that it is the best tablet available. I can't stress how much I love perfection of the display. I've been pleasantly surprised by the unexpected things which it has been so handy for. I'd have loved to have known about its flaws in advance, which is why I write this review -- I hope someone else will go into their purchase feeling more informed and confident about their decision than I felt when I ordered mine. But if I had it to do again, I am pleased to say I'd make the same decisions all over again, so it was an easy 4 stars.", "Date": "January 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Will an iPad work for you?", "Author": "Artlover \"Experience It All\"", "ReviewID": "R35HWMRSKXH9XA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're deciding whether or not to buy an iPad 1 or iPad 2, you may want to read this first.  I've had an iPad 1 for 9 months.  Before I bought it, I doubted how much I would use it.  It had no hard drive, USB connectors, DVD player, camera, full keypad, ability to load major business software apps, ability to play flash-developed graphics, and it did not have much storage and memory space.  I wondered how it could be useful to me, since I had many Apple products - Mac Pro, Macbook Pro, iPhone, Mobile Me, Airport, Time Capsule, etc.To my delight the iPad provided 100x my wildest expectations.  Once you start using it for searching the Web and researching just about everything you do, you realize how much more you can get out of the Web and Internet every day.  You begin making tons of use of the Web and it makes you become way more productive in life (home, autos, service providers, education, children, parenting, illness, job, professionally, etc., etc., etc.).  It ends up becoming an extension of your hand, mind, and life.  It doesn't take you over, it merely helps you with everything you do.Email is also a different experience using an iPad.  You find yourself no longer reading email on your phone or computer.  You end up having your iPad with you, no matter where you are.

I loved that movie for all the action and, of course the story, but more for the way that the creators of the film portrayed the future. All of the self driving cars, and gadgets that no one had ever thought of.Anyway, I was watching it the other day and the police chief guy with the bald head and glasses was carrying around something that looked like a book, but it had a screen. It seemed as if the screen was a touch screen, and he was having what appeared to be a video chat with another law enforcement agent on the thing. This was an idea of a gadget that the creators of the story and movie thought they would see in the distant future, like 2020's or 2030's. An awesome portable, touch screen device that had most, if not all the functionality of a PC, but smaller than a book. It's not 2020 something, though, and I realized that I had a much better, sleeker, and if I might say more futuristic looking device that performed as described right next to me. It was the iPad2.Now, I'm no Apple fanboy. Not in the least. I grew up using Windows machines at home, and my only experience with Apple before buying my first ipod touch 4G was in the \"computer lab\" in elementary school. But, last June I picked up the iPod touch 4G like I said, and I was blown away. It was so easy to use. So portable, so fast. I didn't like one thing, though, and it was the fact that the damn screen was too small to really use it for all the things that you could use it for other than just music and videos, like surfing the net, or using any of the million apps available. My hands were just too big.This was a problem. I don't have a lot of money to throw around, and the next step up on the Apple mobile line was the iPad2, and the 32GB version that I wanted was around $600! Thats a lot of money. And I already had an iPod, and at least two other Windows based machines that are very fast and up to date. It just didn't make sense to really buy the thing.I just kept falling more and more in love with the iPod touch, though, and more particularly with iOS and how well it performed. Everything worked and made sense. You wanted music, you hit the music \"button\" on the screen. Email you say? After you set up your account you just press the mail button. Pretty simple. The touch gestures are amazing too. The responsiveness and speed at which the device reacts is amazing. And its so smooth, people. Seriously, if you haven't handled an iOS5(when I got the ipod touch it was iOS4 i think, but the update is awesome) device you owe it to yourself to try it. Its incredible.But, I was still using that super tiny screen, and I couldn't send an email because my fingers would hit like 3 keys at a time and it would take a year to type it all out correctly. Surfing the net, although super fast and smooth, was horrible because typing a web address took a long time. What was I to do? I just gave up on using the iPod for anything other than media, and the occasional youtube video. I still played games on it, but even with the games, I really wanted a bigger, brighter screen.I started to look for reasons to buy the iPad2, and I couldn't come up with any. Not for about two months, at least, until my girlfriend said she needed a laptop and didn't really have any money to buy one. Bingo. I would give her the laptop, and even though she lives with me and I can still use the thing, I'll be down a machine and it leaves an opening for me to replace it. Right? Right!Off to my local retailer(sorry amazon)I go. 30 minutes later(store is literally right down the street from me) and I'm at home, updating the operating system and transferring all of my previous purchases and then I'm up and running. I was blown away.I knew what I was getting, a much bigger version of the iPod touch 4G. And, I got exactly that, and a whole lot more. First, the screen size is a huge plus. Much bigger than the iPod touch of course, and more than big enough to handle any number of tasks or games, or whatever. The keys on the touch screen keyboard are a really good size. No missed keys here people. And my fingers aren't small. The screen is so bright, and it just begs you to touch it. Movies and videos look great, and the web and all the apps are very vivid. This thing just looked great.It was lightweight too, and very thin. Physically this thing is like a very thin composition pad. Actually, much thinner than a composition book. About the same weight, though. Overall, the dimensions and weight make this thing ultra portable.If you're at all familiar with iOS you know about the apps, and they're pretty much all great. There are quite a few that are free as well, so don't let that stop you. In fact, some of the best games and apps available are free, or are just a buck so its not that bad. They range from super useful to super fun. Everything from photo transferring(desktop/laptop to ipad without USB)to remote desktop connection, to Grand Theft Auto is available, and almost anything you can think of has an app. Need a level? You can get one on your ipad for free. Want to tweak a photo? Get photo toaster jr for free and get tweaking. The apps are a real strong point for this device, and they make up for some of short comings of the device(more on that later.The battery last forever. Ten hours is more than enough for me. Plus you get a wall charger and a usb style hook up that you can use to hook up to your car if you have the adapter. Sweet.Like I said, processing speed is very quick, and it handles everything I throw at it all day long with no problems. Videos run without clipping or lag time and apps load up and run perfectly. I never have any freezes or crashes. Awesome.I can't say enough good things about this thing. Really. I can say few bad things as well. I wouldn't say bad, but you know, not what I would want from a \"perfect\" device.First, there are no USB ports. This sucks. There are apps that like I said earlier will help you transfer photos and videos, and documents, but it would be better if you could just plug directly in to the device.Second, you can't charge this thing with your laptop. Or I can't. It has to be plugged into the wall. Not too bad, but it sucks if you need to charge and you have laptop full of juice but no outlet.The biggest problem I have is the price point. Honestly, this thing is worth double what they want for it in my opinion. It will redefine how you look at computing in general. It is so much more intimate. But, even with that said, I think I have the right after purchasing to complain about the price a little. Again, worth every penny, but really pricey and I had to save up for the thing, and that sucks sometimes.Other than that, go buy this thing. Seriously. And shame on you if you think you can get what this thing delivers from a Kindle. Those guys are playing a very bad game of catch up. And they're going to lose. Think Android to compete with the iphone. I've used both. Androids are horrible. Epic fail. Now Amazon wants to lose money trying to compete with a legend. Trust me, if you want mobile, go Apple.

These are not necessarily downsides, just things that are keeping me from using it separately from the computer.It should really be able to update the podcasts I'm subscribed to automatically via wifi - it shouldn't require reconnecting to iTunes.The virtually seamless integration it has with the Apple TV is proof to me that it should be capable of doing these things.The battery life is pretty impressive. The biggest issues I have with its power relate to charging. It comes with a special 10W power adapter which allows you to charge the iPad in a relatively reasonable timeframe, but charging it via the computer's USB port is as easily measured in days as hours.The charger looks exactly like the ones that come with the iPhone and iPod, and it will charge slowly with those, but the iPad's 10W adapter will overcharge the batteries in the iPad's smaller cousins, seriously diminishing their life.

I tried the MOTOROLA XOOM Android Tablet (Wi-Fi) and was happy enough until I tried this iPad 2.  I love this updated version!  The only issue I had was trying to decide which version to get since there are many options.Storage capacity can be 16 GB, 32 GB or 64 GB.  I would recommend at least the 32 GB since you cannot expand the storage and although apps do not take up much space, I was amazed at the amount of stuff I loaded onto my iPad (photos, movies, music, documents, etc.).  Trying to save some money, I wondered if I should get wi-fi only or the wi-fi/3G combination and with which service provider, AT&T; or Verizon? Every iPad has wireless technology built in and automatically finds wi-fi networks easily but if you want to use it while traveling, the great outdoors or rural areas, wi-fi is not always an option.  If you have an iPhone 4, you can use it as a personal wi-fi hotspot for your iPad but your iPhone carrier might charge extra when this option is used.  Also, GPS is on the 3G models only, wi-fi provides an approximate location and this could be an issue if you love using Four Square or other GPS based applications.  More importantly, the wi-fi only model cuts your battery time down (~8 hours).  If you do choose wi-fi + 3G, I would check with AT&T; or Verizon networks for pricing before deciding.  Both seem to provide reasonable costs for domestic usage but international usage is outrageous.  The previous iPad allowed any carrier to be used overseas (which is a bargain) but I'm not sure if AT&T; and Verizon models allow for the same thing.This new version is lighter, faster, slimmer and has slightly longer battery life at 10 hours.  I love the brilliant LED backlit display on the 9.7 inch screen.  I'm still not a fan of Pages (iWork) but it is possible to get Word documents on your iPad through iTunes.  There is no official Microsoft version but being able to download Word documents from my pc to the iPad and work on them makes a huge difference for me. I really love the technological improvements that allows this iPad to know your every move and be more responsive.  No matter how you rotate this iPad, the display self adjusts - even if you place it upside down!  It makes playing games like Critter Ball that much more fun to play and allows viewing movies or reading a book in any position.  Need I comment about Apple apps?  They beat the Android and every other market out there on this score and help make Apple products first choice.For me, The only thing that prevents this tablet from being perfect is a better camera and the lack of Mozilla (I know this will never happen).  I have tried a lot of tablets and prefer this one over all others.  Yes, it is expensive but I consider it a good investment since it allows me to complete tasks on-the-go and help pass the time while waiting.  I think having this iPad along with an iPhone (or any smartphone) is the best combination.  Smartphones can provide information from the web but their small screen size can make viewing difficult and this iPad allows for a perfect union.", "Date": "April 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Much More Than the Novelty I Thought I was Buying", "Author": "D. Reinstein \"marindavid\"", "ReviewID": "RQTYDX3UXR5S3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After being tempted to buy a tablet for many months, when Apple introduced its new generation iPad and, at the same time, dropped the price of the earlier version, the iPad2 by $100 across-the-board, I jettisoned the thoughts about buying a relatively inexpensive Android device with a 7-8\" screen and bought the basic iPad2 with the minimal 16GB and WiFi only. Initially thinking that I was buying a new toy, a `novelty', I soon discovered that the iPad2 is much more than that. I use it for dozens of things I never imagined using one for and have become quite attached to it, especially when travelling or just sitting in my favorite easy chair at home.A great deal has been written about the technology and capacities of the iPads, so I will not waste your time reiterating them here. Suffice it to say that this one is the most basic model available. It requires a WiFi connection to operate and its total storage capacity is what seems like a `mere' 16GBs. My focus here is more on my personal experience with my first tablet. I am glad that I waited for the iPad.Being a 65 year old man, my are no longer nimble enough to manage the tiny keys on a Smart Phone nor is my vision acute enough to read things easily on a 3\" screen.  On the iPad, however, with its 9.7\" screen and keypad that is entirely adequate, I have become quickly facile.The limited memory is entirely adequate as I do not download and keep movies and am not an accumulator of music. The memory is needed to manage the necessary receiving elements of the various applications (Apps) that I choose to install the capacities for. Many are free, a lot of them cost between 99 cents and $3.99 and some cost more. The most expensive one I have is called \"Pages\" and is a comprehensive word processing and office management suite. Compared to the prices of `installable' programs, this is remarkable cheap. Some of my favorite apps are free, like voice recording capacities and \"GoSkyWatch\", an App that looks at the night sky through the out-facing camera and shows what constellations are there. It is like having my own telescope.The 20-30 Apps I currently have installed have used about 2GBs of the total available hard drive. I don't expect to run out. The exclusive use of WiFi vs. 3G has a pro and con to it. In the Pro column, WiFi is pretty universally available in most places and it requires no paid data plan to access the internet and use all of the iPad's features. On the Con side of the ledger, the device is usable ONLY where there is a WiFi connection available. With 3G and a data-plan, the iPad can connect from anywhere you can access a signal for your cell phone.At this time, for my own purposes, this basic iPad2 has been a rather surprising delight. I understand that the camera resolution on the third generation iPad is far superior, but what I see on this iPad2 is perfectly adequate for me - and, I expect, for most other people as well.The price is right and the product is truly outstanding.", "Date": "May 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Tablet on the market for now... I'm looking at you google", "Author": "AK529", "ReviewID": "R1WA14IGR0EPJT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The iPad 2 has got to be one the best things I have ever owned. In the start I thought I never \"needed\" just wanted it. But now I cant see myself not living without one. I hardly use my 17inch desktop replacement now. I only use it for certain tasks like downloading files, converting files, heavy typing tasks and pc gaming. I also hardly use my HTC Deire Android smartphone or iPod touch 3rg gen for surfing or apps any more when Im home. After trying many different tablets and reading many reviews and lastly just playing around with the iPad 2, I knew it was the best tablet on the market right now. Yes it does have many drawbacks if you compare it to the other tablets, but the it also has many great things about it and pros greatly outweigh the cons. Coming from an iPod touch i was already familiar with iOS. I also plan on getting an iPhone as my next smart phone. I prefer iOS over android and other operating systems for mobile devices. iOS just works and flows really well. Its really reliable and easy to use. Any body any age can pick an iOS device especially an iPad and just start using it right away, its just that easy. I do really wish the iPad 2 had flash but over time I got used to it. Also there are many work around for watching or using flash on the iPad 2. Their are at least 10 different apps/browsers that will allow you to use flash on your iPad 2. Also over time flash will die. It is a aging format, it drains too much battery and memory and its slow and most of all there's all sorts of security issues with it. I know since I use adobe flash on my htc desrie all the time. Also many websites, I would say as much as 75% of them offer 2 choices html 5 or flash versions of their website. I also wish the iPad 2 had a higher resolution screen. Many of the other android tablets do have a higher resolution. They also have better cameras, more ram and dual speakers. Regarding the screen I havent noticed that the resolution is an issue right now any way all videos, web pages, apps and games look great on it. Also the speaker is gerat even though its just one on the bottom right, its still fairly loud and does the job. In terms of performance I don't find the iPad 2 slow in any way even though it has less ram than the other tablets on the market. Here is where the iPad 2 excels when compared to its competitors: The battery life is just crazy at 10 hours, yes at times I do wish the battery was removable so I could just swap another but its just really long lasting. The iPad 2 is supper light especially when compared to the other tablets or even the previous iPad. At first I found it a little on the heavy side and I do still wish it was a little bit lighter like around 1 pound, which Im sure the next will be. I think there is only one tablet which is lighter than the iPad 2 and that's the samsung galaxy tab 10.1. The iPad 2 has the best app store. It has the most apps, the best quality apps, and the developers make the apps for apple first before android, blackberry or windows 7 phone. Apple also has the largest store to purchase music, music videos, tv shows and movies. You can also rent movies on it. The iPad 2 has the best selection of games out of all the other tablets. Their are tons of games free and paid on the iPad 2. The iPad 2 just like any other product has huge number of third party accessories available for it. Apple has great customer service and a great warranty. I do have to warn you that when I received my iPad 2 in the first week of may. I had purchased it online from appples website and it was shipped to me in 3 weeks directly form the factory in china. I was aware that their maybe a backlight bleeding issue on some iPad 2s. It turns out mine had it and I wouldn't have known if I wasn't on the forums. I went into an apple store and the genius replaced it on the spot. Mind you I did get a refurbished model. But the refurbished replacement was flawless with no backlight bleeding and haven't had any issues with it yet. So I caution you to maybe wait until they say for sure that they have fixed the defect with all iPad 2s and then make the purchased. Or you can make your purchase now and see if you get a defective one or not. Overall I am very happy with my iPad 2. I do suggest going for highest memory option you can afford especially if your gonna use it for more than just browsing and email. The apps and games do add app and its always nice to have that extra storage available. Also if you can afford the extra $100 for the 3G connectivity I do suggest that also. That is one feature I wish I had got. I seem to use my iPad 2 mostly at home but when I'm out I do wish I have the 3G since I have to use my smartphone as a hotspot and use up its battery and data. If you get the one with 3G you can always just sign up for no contract data and just turn the plan on and off whenever you really need it with no commitments. Lastly, the iPad 2 does have the antenna gate issue which lowers the signal of the data connection of the device when holding it a certain way. I disappointed to hear this, but its seems these days almost any mobile device has some sort of issue like this. I have noticed it on my 2 ipod touchs and htc desire and now the iPad 2. It happens when you hold down on the speaker grill on the bottom left of the iPad 2. I have noticed it only drops the signal by one bar. So if I have 3 bars on wifi then it drops 2 bars. It there is only one bar then it doesn't drop the connection. I have also done a speed test and it slows down the speed by about one third. It never seems to affect streaming video or music for me. The iPad 2 is a great device I don't regret buying it all. I could just bought a cheap netbook but I a tablet. I was never even a fan of the iPad when it first came out, I thought it was just an over sized iPod touch which I already had. Also I was never a big follower of apple products, yes, I have owned a couple of iPod touchs but that's about it. I was also never a fan of the iPhone just found it over rated. But now after owning the iPad 2 for almost 3 months I can honestly say it is the coolest thing I have ever owned.December 2011 update: Well after owning the iPad 2 for about 7 months I can say its a great device but not good enough. The iOS 5 update made this worse in many ways especially battery life. The device is also more buggy now. Alot of the new features work but dont work right or all the time. I did update to 5.01 and battery life as improved but not to what it was before 5.0. I am anxiously awaiting a worthy tablet from google. The lack of flash, not having real multitasking, not being able to modify or customize my tablet in any way, not having micro sd card or usb ports really makes me wanna get an android based tablet. As soon as there is an android tablet that is just as good as the iPad 2 or better I will be getting it and selling this iPad 2. In the mean time I guess I will have to just deal with the limitations of an iOS device. Jailbreaking my iPad 2 did improve the usability of it alot but then I updated to iOS 5 and I no longer have a jailbreak. Jailbreaking still doesn't compare to the hack-ability and customization an android device is capable of especially if rooted.April 2012 update: aftering owning my iPad 2 for almost a year now I am still very happy with it. When I first wrote my review I thought maybe the an android tablet would be better for me. Since then I tried the asus transformer prime and found out the grass is not greener on the other side. The asus prime was buggy, had all sort of glitches. I wasn't happy with the hardware or software especially after using an iPad. The lack of tablet specific apps was also very limited. The only thing I miss from the prime was the keyboard dock which provided extra battery life, extra ports and a hardware keyboard. There is still nothing like this for the iPad. All the keyboards are Bluetooth and end up draining the iPads battery quicker. There is the apple keyboard dock but only works in portrait mode and can only be used on desk or flat surface.The iPad 2 is even better than before now since the price has been reduced to $400 and you can get a refurb unit for only $350. Personally I think the refurb should be $300. But $350 is still a great price and ofcourse people will still buy it at that price. I don't really see a point in upgrading to the newer iPad. I played around with it in the store and yes it did look better but only when you put the two of them next to each other. They say only people who use their iPad for videos and gaming will really benefit from the better screen. The newer screen is also suppose to reduce eye strain for reading.  The iPad is still the best tablet on the market and will continue to be so for a while at least until google finally gets their act together and produce a comparable tablet.  Androids lack of tablet apps and fragmentation is really killing and holding google back from competing with Apple.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "A warning about where to purchase an ipad 3G", "Author": "Denny", "ReviewID": "R3B4UDIYMEUZLR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "If you buy from Apple, the 3G is either $15 or $25 per month as the SIM is included, but if you buy the ipad with 3G from anyone else, you must go get the microSIM card from either ATT or Verizon depending on what model ipad you purchased.

I paid full price for my 64gb iPad and I don't regret it, even as long as it took me to save up for it.  I love getting digital copies of movies (like from the bluray discs you were already going to buy) and putting them on this bad boy to take wherever I want.  Not only can I enjoy it, but with an AV adapter cord I can plug it up to any HDTV and entertain everyone.Obviously the apps are awesome.  There practically is an app for everything.  My biggest consideration in getting the iPad over an ereader was the amount of books you have access to.  On an iPad, you have access to all the iBooks, Kobo books, B&N; nook books, and amazon kindle books through their own app.  Just recently I found one negative thing about having an iPad over a kindle.  I'm not talking about the fire either, because I really don't know enough about the fire to compare point for point, I'm just talking ebooks here.  The Kindle lets you borrow one book a month I believe it is for free (the kindle version ones that are listed as $0.00) if you are an amazon prime member.  Until recently, I wasn't a prime member and I wasn't disappointed until I found out that the iPad app for kindle doesn't offer the free borrowing of books unless you have an actual kindle. This may change some day if enough people complain, but as of right now, it isn't offered.  So if you are fine with paying for all of your books or you aren't willing to pay to be a prime member, then you have access to more books on an ipad.  Oh another cool thing is that you can download the overdrive app which you can rent digital books or audiobooks from your local library with your library card for free.  I love the audiobooks because I'm sure you know how expensive they are to buy, and unless I know for sure its a good book, I'm not willing to drop $20-$45 on an audiobook.As for the internet on the iPad, browsing is a breeze, saving pages and bookmarking is a breeze.  The only thing is it does have some problems connecting to little mom and pop wif signals for some reason.  Its a known problem and I imagine the iPad3 will be better at this.  Other than that there are no complaints from me for the internet.Printing from the iPad is so cool, too.  Even if you don't have an airprint printer, you can still find an app to print to almost any printer through wifi.  I haven't found one yet that I couldn't print on using Print Bureau.  Its really cool and after you figure out how to use it, its pretty simple too.  I can even print to my huge commercial printer/scanner/network fax machine at work.I also love the adapters for cameras that lets you easily plug and transfer pictures/video directly to the iPad to send or post somewhere online.If you have an iPod or iPhone, the charger that comes with the iPad is much stronger, and charges your other apple idevices much faster than with the chargers that came with them.Overall very happy with my purchase!!!I wanted to add an update, my schoolwork is online and I did find a way around the adobe flash problem so that I can access all of my school assignments and take tests from my iPad.

I wouldnt be surprised if the next gen iPad is up there with ps3 and xbox 360.

I had the Ipad 2 in four days from the date of the last email, which was seven days after the order.  Needless to say, it was a big surprise for my wife.  She loves it.  It is easy to use!  The apps load quickly, and are readily available.  Since receiving this gift my wife has started using her Ipad 2 everyday.  Unlike the netbook which was being used a couple of times per week.

Even though this is my first Apple product I have become rather proficient in using it. It is a step up from my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 when using it on the internet, but the Kindle has been truly reliable and easy to use.The unit arrived with a 3% battery charge so I plugged in the charger and came back to it the next morning to find it at only 74% charge. So I left it for another 24 hours while I searched the net for iPad2 battery issues. It seems everyone feels that these units are slow to recharge. When it finally reached a 100% charge I started learning how to use it. This is not a toy, it really is a computer and has many features that are not readily apparent so I bought an \"iPad For Dummies\" book on Amazon to help me get the most out of my unit. I recommend this to anyone new to an iPad. Recharges now take less time than before. I paid $214.99, including shipping, for this unit and feel like I saved 50% over a new unit. I surf the web, do emails, read my Kindle books on it and am now searching the available Apple apps.I feel really great about this purchase and the unit.

Apple Marketing, please think about your naming conventions in the future! But I still love my iPad 2!I use my iPad 2 just about every day. I mainly use it for reading email when I don't feel like pulling out the Macbook Pro. I also use it as an eReader (Amazon, Nook, Safari Books online, MacTech magazine, iBooks, etc). No it's not the retina display. But if you can't afford the retina display this is the next best thing. I can read this one just fine, so no upgrading for me.I didn't choose one with a data plan (would have been 3G when I bought this - last year), but I don't find that I need one. One hint on the data: If you can find a decent mifi data plan then you can just get the wifi version of the iPad and be done with it. Even so, I find wifi hotspots all over the place (including my house of course, which is where I use it a lot).The camera is ok, but I use my iPhone for pics, so I really don't care. They could have substituted the camera for some other feature and I would have been just as happy.It is an awesome game platform as it gives you more space to play with. It also works great with the Apple TV and streaming audio.Yes, Android tablets are catching up, but they still aren't there yet. They don't have the price point of an iPad nor the consistency of the user experience.The iPad is also a durable product: I have dropped mine, and only had small cracks appear on the bezel, with no affect on performance whatsoever.

I was a little disappointed with it at first, since it wasn't \"magic\" and didn't really live up to the hype. But I used it for reading books and watching movies, and slowly found myself using it for more and more things, until eventually it replaced my laptop (which, with my netbook, now sits collecting dust most of the time). Between my iPad and my desktop computer, they cover just about everything I need or want a computer for. As a result, I can't see myself buying another laptop, ever. (Or perhaps I will buy one some day as a more mobile replacement for my desktop.)When Apple brought out the \"retina\" iPad, they also dropped the price on the iPad 2, and I bought an Apple-refurbished iPad 2 as an upgrade for my first-gen iPad. But this time, I stuck with wifi-only, since the AT&T; 3G was (and is) marginal in my neighborhood, and went with the bottom-end 16GB version because I had never used more than 12 GB of storage on the original iPad.For three-fifty plus tax and free shipping, the refurb iPad 2 is a ridiculously good deal. Apple replaces the battery and metal shell--the parts most likely to be damaged or worn out--when they refurbish iPads.  I honestly can't tell that mine is a refurb. It looks and acts like it is brand new.The iPad 2 is significantly faster than the original, which I notice mostly while browsing the web, but also with some games. It's lighter, and the battery lasts almost as long. Apple keeps adding features to iOS, so the iPad continues to become more useful.

I have researched for quite a long time before I bought my Prime (since returned) and actually had THREE Android tablets that all just did not cut it for me.  If you are on a lower budget, than certainly there are MANY Android tablets out there.  If you have the funds, I highly recommend the Apple iPad 2 as it is about the the best \"overall\" tablet out there.  Whether you like Apple or Steve Jobs history or politics, the iPad 2 really is a quality machine.  Nothing is perfect, and nothing will please everybody, but in comparing devices, I now have the experience with both platforms and will pick iPad as the best of the two.  For the average user, that being the non-technical, non-programmer type, and the person NOT looking for a tablet to replace a PC or laptop, the iPad 2 is a wonder.  Yes, it sure has different operating system and is \"closed\" compared to Android.  Yes, it does not support Java or Flash, but these are small issues. If you MUST have Java or Flash, or \"hate\" Apple, then no matter what anybody says, you will not like any reviews of the iPad 2.  If you are a regular \"Joe\" or \"Janet\", then read carefully all of the reviews and see that the iPad is a great unit if you can afford the extra dollars.  In a few weeks, the iPad 3 is likely announced and the prices for the remaining iPad 2's will likely decreases.  When that happens grab one immediately.  Of course, if you have the money, might want to consider the iPad 3.  People seem to get personal about an Apple product, either love them or hate them.  I have no bias, I own an Android Phone and will likely keep it.  I own an Ipod Touch and will probably keep it.  Since I have an Ipod and have had one for years (since they came out) I am familiar with iTunes and the iTunes Store.  If you are one of these people, you will find the interface of the iPad 2 familiar to you. Almost every application I used on the iPad 2 (my wifes) as compared to the Android devices was better.  Yahoo and SKYPE Video chat was far superior.  I did not use the camera on the iPad 2, but then again, a camera on a tablet is of NO importance to me.  Ease of use and quality are, and I choose (now) the iPad 2.  I simply like the Apple OS on a tablet better than Android. A huge difference I found with the iPad 2 over Android, is that with the default Android Sync program, I could not SEND an email from my exchange.  I could RECEIVE only.  After finding this out, and searching online, it is common issue and you need to download a third party SYNC program to accomplish this.  The iPad 2 works flawlessly out of the box sending and receiving exchange emails. I almost bought an iPad 2 in the beginning, and after three different Android units, am certainly going to purchase the iPad (2 or 3).  Things might just work out better anyway now, that a new iPad will be announced shortly.*****update: I did purchase an iPad 2 on March 7 after the price was lowered by $100. I can safely state again that this is a fabulous device and I highly recommend.

The lack of Flash is really a problem because there are still many sites that use Flash technology. Really, really annoying.Although printing is only possible with a select few Canon printers, I am not going out of my way to purchase a Canon printer just so I can print from my iPad.The GOOD stuff:The really great thing about this device is when you turn it on, Bam!  It's on.  No wait time, no boot up time.iPad vs Kindle.Initially I bought the iPad as an e-reader because the experience is much superior when compared to the Kindle.  The touch screen is much more book like, turning pages with your finger is much more intuitive than pushing a button.  The scrubber at the bottom of the page so you can slide to any page, where as the Kindle you have to push a button or use the \"go to\" function and type in the desired page.  iPad lets you know what page and chapter name you're on rather than just a percent, the Kindle gives no chapter name or page number.  Every issue the Kindle has is addressed with the iPad.  The color screen is much better than the Kindle e-ink screen.***********************3G and GPS Chip.I am very glad I have these options.  When ever you want access the internet in remote areas via 3G, just go the \"settings\", cellular data and log in and turn on that option.  So for the next 30 days at $15 you have internet access.The GPS chip is included with the 3G.  There are GPS apps for free, Waze and Motion X GPS Drive for purchase.  With the 3G option you need to turn on the Cellular Data in order for the GPS to work.Waze app is free and is pretty accurate but it did give me incorrect directions but it can only get better since the information is user generated.  Just driving around with Waze turned on generates information for other drivers.  It has voice guidance but does not give specific street names.  It is good in showing road conditions, traffic, hazards, etc....Motion X Drive app is 99 cents and just as good or better than Garmin.  It has many options and gives two different female voices for guidance, nothing really sexy.  It also states the street names but must be purchased for either $3 for 30 days or $20 for one year.  It also gives road conditions but Waze probably does a better job.***********************FaceTimeThe Jetsons technology is here.

I find the ipad too heavy to hold when reading. Perhaps that can't be helped. It certainly is not heavy in the real sense of the word. It's easy to carry with you anywhere. But to hold it upright for long periods like you do the Kindle is not what it was made for. So, I read my books on the Kindle.That aside, I used to think the iPad was an expensive toy. I was wrong. I use it for my business and investments and have yet to play a game on it. I get streaming quotes and financial news and instant updates. Apple has so many apps that you'll find exactly what you want. I have lots of fitness and exercise apps that help me keep my health in check.Lots of people have written in-depth reviews on the iPad and I'm not going to try and do the same thing. I merely want to say that this is a powerful device that can put power in your hands and add a lot to your business and personal life.Apple support is decent but you can't get refunds for apps you don't like or that don't work for you. That's a major con and very much unlike Amazon. Also, Apple's site --- iTunes --- is hard to navigate. But those are the only cons I've found thus far.A word of advice: While 16gb is a considerable amount of space for books, etc, you may regret not getting more memory. I do. Just the apps alone (if you buy a lot of them as I did and most people do) take up lots of space. And video uses lots of memory. I didn't think I'd keep many videos on my iPad but I do. I'm now using about three-forths of my memory and I've only had the device about a month or less. I can assure you that next time I'll spend a bit more and buy more memory and you might want to consider that as well.Highly recommended.- Susanna K.

My husband had just purchased a computer for me as a birthday gift coincidentally, and it had a hard drive failure the 3rd time it booted up.  So we returned it and bought a second iPad 2 for me.  We are completely addicted.  They are so user friendly, work well, and are instant on and off (instead of waiting forever to boot up and shut down like a computer).  We both absolutely love them.You iPad may not have the latest operating system on it since many have been sitting in stores waiting to be sold.  If it has 4.3.5 or older, then you simply can take it to a Verizon store and have them activate it at no charge.  They are an official Apple Store.If you need to update your iPad 2 to the new IOS 5 that is to be released in October 2011, then I have some tips, to possibly prevent a lot of grief. HOWEVER, you can just skip all the rest of the technical part of my review if you pay a small fee to have operating system IOS 5 downloaded onto your new iPad 2 so that it is completely independent of a regular computer and iTunes. This is a huge step that Apple has been developing for awhile now.  I don't know if Verizon will do it for free, but Best Buy will do it for $29.95.  If you go to Verizon, make sure the employee is quite familiar with activating the iPad, etc.  Our local Verizon person acted like she knew, but when I brought it home, it wasn't activated.  That's why I had to go through all this stuff so I could do it on my own computer.The current operating system as of today requires hook up to a computer that has iTunes on it.  The new \"IOS 5\" is due to come out in the next 10-15 days, between October 10-15, 2011.  Anyone who buys an iPad 2 that already has IOS 5 loaded and, also, anyone who already owns an ipad 2 who updates to this version; will be able to do everything without being dependent upon a computer and iTunes.  Right now, you upload photos, your own music, and download and install updates via your computer using iTunes on a regular computer. You can load these things by emailing to your iPad from your computer where they are stored, but if you have a lot, it is easier to transfer via iTunes on your computer.My review is long and some is very technical.  You can stop here if I've already given you helpful info you wanted to know.  The very next section is about some apps I recommend and then after that is the very technical part that isn't necessary if you don't have a computer or want to take my suggestion and pay to have IOS 5 installed on your iPad.------Before I get on with the heavy-duty technical part that you may or may not want read, let me recommend a few apps that you can purchased inexpensively.  Part of the fun is customizing your iPad with apps that you enjoy or help you with your tasks:1. A free app for the iPad is \"Goodreader.\"  This is a great app.  You can view about any format of a file in this app, even Excel files.  You can also make annotations with various symbols and highlighting that the program offers.  You can also unzip a zip file in Goodreader.  I've never done it, but you can watch a video in that app as well.  It has a great folder and file management system that is easy.  I believe you can even bring in files to your iPad from your computer via wi-fi or ftp.  You can also save a web page for reading off line when you are not near wi-fi, such as on an airplane.  I really like this program.2.  If you like to use Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel, you can get these apps, but they are $20 each.  I have two excel spreadsheets that I like to keep up on a daily or weekly basis.  One, for example, are our household expenditures and deposits.  Since Goodreader doesn't let you actually add to a Word document or Excel file, I found a program called \"Office 2 HD.\"  This one is not free.  It is a $6.99 program plus fee and tax, but that is less than you pay for either Word or Excel.  It's pretty easy.  What I did was email to myself my Excel file from my computer.  I opened the email in iPad 2 and clicked on the attached file.  Then I tapped on the little curved arrow that you would tap if you want to reply to or forward an email and it gave me the option of opening the file in either Goodreader or Office 2 HD.  I selected Office 2 HD.  Then I opened that app, opened that file, and tapped the Save button.  The Save button gives you a choice of Save or Save As.  When you want to be able to type in the file, you choose Save As and rename it.  If you don't want to rename the file, than add a \"1\" to the file name on your computer before you email it to yourself on iPad; and then when you Save As, just delete the 1.  Easy.  Of course, it works differently inserting rows, etc., than a regular spreadsheet of Excel program, so you really do need to refer to their help menu.  I like the program though, because it is inexpensive and lets me keep up edit my favorite already existing spreadsheets.  You can create new ones also, of course.  I haven't used the word processor yet, but it is probably even easier than a spreadsheet.  Oh, it has a Power Point type program in it also.3.  Right now the default Safari brower on the iPad isn't very good.  I'm very spoiled to using tabs so I can open search listings in a new tab without losing my search page or use the tabs to go back and forth comparing info on two or three different web pages.  The new IOS 5 is giving Safari tabs.  However, I really like \"Web Perfect Browser\" which is only $3.99 plus fee and tax.  Not only does it provide a tab system for browsing, but will also save web pages for offline reading.  I save a web page in the Browser if it is something I want to read later, but not necessarily save.  I save a web page in Goodreader, if I want to keep it for reference.  I don't know all the changes they are going to make in Safari.  You might go ahead and check it all out before buying Web Perfect Browser in case it is good enough for your purposes.4.  A great picture organizer program is \"Photo Mgr Pro.\"  Once again, the new IOS 5 is making big improvements on the default photo.  Perhaps you won't even need this app.  The current default Photo app is terrible.  You cannot put them in the order you want.  As far as I know, the only way to create Albums (folders) is to arrange the folders you want in a special iPad folder on your computer first and then upload the special folder and its contents to the iPad through iTunes.  You still can't arrange the order, however.  I know they have made improvements in the new operating system; but if you don't like it, try the Photo Mgr Pro.  It's good.By the way, the final price of an app varies because some are Apple apps and some are 3rd-Party developers.  The developers do get a fee from each purchase.  All apps have tax added.  I'm not sure how this works, but I do notice that the difference between the app purchase price and the final price is not always the same percentage.  However, apps are so reasonably priced, it just isn't that important.  Just know that when it says $3.99, it actually will be a little more.---------THE TECHNICAL PART OF MY REVIEW REGARDING PROBLEMS UPDATING OR INSTALLING ITUNES:It isn't a big deal using your computer and iTunes (if you have a computer) unless you have the following problems that I ran into.  Here are a couple of solutions below.DON'T LET MY INSTRUCTIONS SCARE YOU.  REMEMBER, you can just have IOS 5 put on it after its released, and you don't have to deal with any of this. By the way, if you don't have a computer, you can take the iPad to a Verizon store to activate it. They don't charge for it since they are contracted by Apple. Best Buy may also do it for a small fee when you don't buy it there.  Best Buy will also download and install updates for you for $29.95, so wait until the new IOS 5.0 is released and have them put that one on it.  That eliminates the computer and iTunes problem since you will be able update and download from the iPad. (I'm repeating, but knowing how to do this with ease and avoiding the problems is valuable to know.)Now back to the iTunes problem.  NOTE:  My instructions are for a PC with XP. It is possible you won't be able to install the latest version of iTunes.  You need a version later than the 9.0 and above series.  It must start with a 10.0 or later for it to be connected to your ipad.  I use version 10.4.1.  I discovered that since I apparently had some previous version of iTunes and/or Quick Time on my computer, it left behind some kind of language.  Therefore, after I downloaded itunes version 10.4.1 and attempted to install it; it appeared to install, but wouldn't open.  An error message appeared saying there were missing files.  After spending 3 days researching off and on for the solution and trying to reinstall etc., I finally found a document on the Internet stating exactly what to remove and how to do it. INSTRUCTIONS: From the PC via Add and Remove Programs in the Control Panel remove iTunes.  Then you remove Apple Application Support.  You don't have to uninstall Quick Time.  Then you close and reboot.  Don't open any programs, but do shutdown firewall and anti-virus programs and turn off your DSL/broadband.  Now you can go to your iTunes install file you saved and install it. Now it will work, or it may say something about Mobile Device Service not started. If so, open Control Panel again and open Administrative Tools.  Open the \"Services\" folder. Click ONCE on Apple Mobile Device folder.  To the left of the file, it says \"Stop the Service\" and \"Start the Service.\"  Click on \"Stop the Service\" and then click on \"Start the Service.\"  I can't remember if you reboot again, but it will tell you. After this, iTunes, should work just fine unless some other cause is creating your problem.NEXT PROBLEM that many people are having is that iTunes will perform all the functions for your iPad except it won't download an OS (Operating System) Update.  It will act like it's downloading, but eventually times out.  I have a solution, but you can confirm that your problem is the same as mine by doing the following:  Open iTunes and click on Help on the menu.  Select \"Run Diagnostics\".  Uncheck everything except the first line to do a Connectivity Test. Make sure your DSL or wi-fi is connected. Click Next. Click Next again and it will list test results.  The first two lines will have green dots, meaning ok.  The third line will be red, \"Secure Link to iTunes Store Failed.\"  What is peculiar about this is that I can purchase an app through the store, but can't download an update.  The problem is somewhere in conflicting language or programs.  After 3 more days of trying to fix, it I finally found a webpage that lists direct links to Apple and instructions.  You choose your particular kind of iPad; for example, iPad 2 wi-fi only.  Then you download the file and save it to a folder where you won't forget where it is.  Be aware that is is a 690 MG file!  It takes hours to download.  I have DSL \"light\" which means it is slower than regular hi-speed, so it took my file 8 hours to download. Make sure your Power settings say never so the computer won't sleep during the download.  It's ok if your monitor sleeps or the desk top activates a screen saver. By the way, I also was not able to download it on my computer than has iTunes.  I had to use my very old computer that has never had iTunes on it.  My itunes computer blocked downloads even directly from Apple!  If you don't have another computer, use someone else's computer that doesn't have iTunes. OR just wait for IOS 5 (release in Oct. 2011) and pay Best Buy $29.95 to download it and install! After downloading it, I put it on a flash drive and transferred it to my other computer that has iTunes.  Next, plug in iPad to your computer via the cable included; do this BEFORE opening iTunes.  If you haven't already activated your new iPad 2, then you will be activating it now through iTunes.  Once it is activated, you are ready to install the update you downloaded, which will IOS 5 after it released. iTunes may pop up a window that asks if you want to download the update.  Press Cancel.  If it is set up to automatically download it, press the X next to the field at the top where it is showing that is is downloading.  That will stop it.  NOW, since your iTunes will not work for downloading if you have the same connectivity issue that I do, you will HOLD DOWN your shift key WHILE you press the UPDATE button.  You will only see the UPDATE button if you plugged in your ipad first to your computer and then open iTunes.  A menu just for your iPad will appear across the middle of the screen and the Update button is on the Summary tab.  After you hold down the shift key while clicking on Update, it will pop up a screen allowing you to find your downloaded file.  If you computer downloaded it as a ZIP file, you'll have to unzip it first and then choose the file.  iTunes will now update your iPad with the new update.  It takes about 10 min or less.  By the way, I have Opera browser on my old computer and discovered that it doesn't force a zip file as some browsers do.  It will download the file as it actually comes with the correct file extension.Hope this review doesn't scare you off.  Remember!  You don't have to deal with any of these problems if you pay a store that is set up for iPads to download the new IOS 5 operating system which makes iPad completely independent of a separate computer and iTunes.  Again, I don't know what Verizon would charge, but $29.95 is pretty good at Best Buy.  Call first to make sure the stores near you will do it.Have fun with Ipad 2.  It's great!

But here's why:1) It was too heavy for me to rest comfortably on lap while lying down.2) I had to purchase GoodReader to see if that would work for the main reason I wanted an ipad2 (to dowload and read academic pdfs from a certain website and zip files from another speciality website). I should have done this to see if it was compatable, but by the time I figured this out I had already invested so much time getting this to work right and had had enuf.3) Similarly, i would have to purchase a stylus to see if I could find one that worked for me. I'm used to using wrist movments and finger movements to work for long periods of time - not upper arm movements - so I would have to use a stylus. was not prepared cause I thought my styluses I already have would work on the IPAD4) Worst onscreen keyboard I have ever used. You have to hit a seperate key to make numbers and symbols like @ appear, and then hit the key again to return to letters. Perhaps i'd get used to this, perhaps not. so for, not.5) Similarly, if you can't touch type with the keyboard (you can't, I tried) then why space them out so far from one another? or why not let it be modifyable depending on the needs of the user?6) in the app store the print is too tiny. Much to my surprise, I could not expand it in the usual way. I did not bother to see if there was another way to expand it7) there's something dizzying about the way it switches between screens.8) Apple's official position is that they will not support WIFI conncections that use the older WEP security. Their only advice is to upgrade to WPA which they are happy to help you with excpet they don't care about the problem that then my older two devices would not be able to connect...So if have intermittant trouple with wifi because of WEP, don't count on Apples help. It took me ages to access some firmware to upgrade, only to find that i can't use WPA.9)In the store, the Ipad I tried got so dim as to be practically black. that's what I want for the dim lighting i use it in. My unit does not get as dim as that one. It's probably ok though.10) The final straw was an irrational one I guess...I decided to take a break from figuring things out and watch some stuff from NBC. I had not realized NBC does not support IPAD. the shows are on hulu but why shyould I pay 8 bucks a month when I can watch for free on my laptop. Other people have commented that they are going to start watching more ABC. I would rather find a table that lets me watch what I want.11)and ok, one more, i would also like to upload files to a speciality website, but didn't check to see if there's an app for that...12) I hate all the going thru ITUNES, a behmoth that now sits on my laptop, though i'd probably get used to this.Overall, Apple is really great at creating problems and then offering to sell you an App for that (no usb, no Word, no excel, can't upload or download files etc.). This is great if your main purpose is to show things to people.

When iPad 2 came out, I thought it was a nice evolutionary step, but not enough for me to upgrade.However, the seemingly small changes do turn out to make a difference.  For example, one of my favorite uses of the original iPad was to read various newspapers and blogs while having breakfast. That worked pretty well, but the limited memory of the original iPad caused web-pages to rarely be cached: Following a link and then hitting the \"back\" button felt a bit sluggish. With iPad 2, this scenario works a lot better. Similarly, FaceTime and video Skype support were attractive to me, but I figured that having an iPhone 4 already would largely mitigate the advantage of having the feature also on iPad.  Well, the larger size of iPad 2 makes it much more natural to have my daughter join alongside of me in a conversation with overseas family members. The small weight and dimension differences also have a disproportional effect. My kids use a drawing app that also seems to benefit from the added hardware capabilities (memory-bound, I think) and GarageBand is even more impressive on iPad 2 than its already remarkable power on my original iPad.I had a chance to try some other tablets (Xoom, 7\" Samsung, and Nook color), but at this time they're far behind iPad in just about every respect (the Nook color's low weight is nice though). The Xoom's screen has odd dimension when web-browsing or reading (it's nice when watching certain movies, but the experience improvement is small compared to the the reduced experience for most other applications, including non-wide-format videos). The smaller Samsung device indeed feels quite small, and, like the Xoom, it's missing nice applications in just about every major category.  Nook color is the least of all these alternatives, but perhaps the most attractive considering its lower price and light weight.", "Date": "June 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Returning Mine", "Author": "Steve Kraner", "ReviewID": "RPGXM1ILH327S", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This Christmas I got a Kindle Fire for my wife, thinking it was simple and easy to use for a non-techie.

It does a lot more than just eBooks.In turn, she got me an iPad, since I like tech toys and have been a long-time Apple and iTunes user. I worked for hours to get the iPad to do simple things like synch my music with no luck.Apple is now so intent on push marketing, like the Genius function in iTunes, that it interferes with basic functionality.I also couldn't get it to connect to my MobileMe account- apparently Apple sets up new iPads up so you cannot access MobileMe even if you have an account.The \"Genius Bar\" at the local Apple Store in Reston - which has traditionally been a good resource the few times I needed it - could not help and was manned by people who didn't care and who knew less about the software and devices than I did. They were also rude to my daughter on a visit. So I went with her the next time and got the same poor treatment and not a single problem on my list fixed.Apple is having a lot of success, but I'm concerned they may also be getting arrogant.If you are considering an iPad - beware it may be a time-sink.

It also has some awesome word processing apps, so if I do need to type something, I can do so with ease, even using a touch screen. It's so nice to be able to pull this out of my bag and have instant Internet access with an amazing screen wherever I am.

I have now started calling it crApple. All they do it market this product as if it is the best thing in the world, but it is definitely not.So why 3 stars.Pros:Yes there is some good stuff, but I do not know how unique it is to Apple. Size, weight and battery life is super. You can use it the whole day, and angry birds is seriously addictive. It remembers each network and its settings so that I do not have to manually change proxy settings everytime I move from office to another place.Cons:Everyone has said it but I'll say it again: No flash = No point! It is so annoying that you have to keep going from one applet to another to do things that you can normally do on a browser. Seriously, if you tube just decided to use flash and to remove their App I think Apple would go bankrupt.Editing stuff is impossible or as difficult as doing it on your phone, with the exception of a larger keyboard. Speaking of the keyboard I cannot for the life of me understand why apple cannot put arrow keys on it! So annoying! Yes there is a magnifier which allows you to scroll the cursor but how tedious it is!A lot of the other stuff has been mentioned in other reviews but these were teh maain points for me.Also - a note for people considering a laptop or this - buy a laptop. This is the 3rd thing you need.This is really ideal for someone who has a large heavy laptop which stays in one place and needs a lighter device to carry around for just brisk surfing, checking mail, watching some youtube and playing games (ie a bigger version of an iPhone).However, if I knew what I know now I would never have bought this thing. I would wait until google improves Android or microsoft comes up with some hardware that will kick Apple of its perch, because there is nothing like a normal windows operating system. I need flash, I need to be able to open, edit and  attach my edited files to gmail through a browser. I need flash (yes I said it again). I also want to be able to download whatever software I like and run it, without it having to be a mobile App.I think what has happened is that I made the mistake of thinking that the bigger screen meant that this was a real computer, rather than just another mobile device with all its limitation.

The 2nd generation is much faster than the original.2. The design, while very similar is more sleek and lighter.3. The cameras are a great addition.Video Skype works great on this tablet - the cameras make showing people things FAR simpler due to the front and back placement.Convenience - I take this to class and with the addition of a bluetooth keyboard I am able to easily take notes in class while carrying FAR less than my laptop in weight.- The battery life is excellent! This thing can go for two days without a recharge! And that's with fairly heavy usage (try that with a laptop!)- The app store is getting better all the time - there are plenty of applications that make using this extremely convenient without having to take the laptop around (it weighs around 1/5 that of my laptop)- even if you bring the charger - it's far less bulky than the laptop charger.This really is the future of mobile computing. The touchscreen is extremely responsive, the machine is very fast - wifi works extremely well.The majority of my iphone apps work on this tablet.The only issue I have is the reflective screen - I am not a fan of the reflective screen and have ordered a matte screen protector - not because I feel it needs protecting, but because I want to be able to read in various lighting conditions.If you waited the first time - wait no longer - very much worth it in my mind.", "Date": "March 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "The ipad 1,2,3, and 4", "Author": "Jo Apple \"Jo\"", "ReviewID": "RLHS8GHEA78HP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have the ipad 4 now and I have had all of the other I pads except the first generation.

If you wear glasses and/or have trouble with blurriness and stuff then by all means upgrade to the 3, but the 4th generation is not even a noticeable difference.  It does have a faster processor but not Samsung fast, so if given the choice go with the 2nd generation if its a lot cheaper than 3rd generation.

You cant compare Apples and oranges. apples are apples and oranges are androids. the samsung is much much much faster and allows you to use flash, but in my opinion that is all.

It's a beautiful product, as with all other Apple products I have purcThe hased however.....the Wi-Fi capability is not so good. It works for a while and then stops working. I called Apple. They had me delete the password for my network and then put the password back in. It worked fine for a while...just as it did when I first installed it. But only for a while. I don't get it. I have a relatively new Belkin 2 wireless network on Cable and have been using it for several years. I have two laptop computers, two printers, and an iPod touch with Wi Fi. They all work just fine. I can work all day, every day on any of these devices from anywhere in my house or in my yard.But not with the iPAD 2.with the iPad 2 it works for a while and then stops working. Very frustrating.This is not only a review but a request for help if anyone knows what's going on.BELOW IS A FOLLOW-UP ON MY IPAD2:BTW IF YOU DON'T WANT TO READ ALL OF THIS, HERE IS A QUICK SUMMARY OF THE MOST IMPORTANT POINTS:1. It never worked properly on my home network or other networks I tried at Starbucks, shopping centers, etc.2. It was too big and heavy.3. To read a book on it was a problems because it was heavy and just touching a little part of the screen caused pages to flip by very fast which meant I had to search for where I was about every few minutes.4. Even though I bought a 2 years warranty, sent it in for repair and eventually got a new/used one from Apple it still never solved any of the problems.5. Apple never would do anything substantive for me...like give me my money back or give me an Apple credit. So in the end I had to sell it for what I could get - $400, which meant I lost $250+plus the accessories, apps, the Warranty etc. I had spent.I am NOT an Apple basher and I enjoy my iPods (3) we have in our family. However, I'll never buy Apple again because of their \"return\" \"credit\" etc. policy. They have really made me unhappy with this experience and I did everything I could to work with them.I got an iPad2 with 32Gig memory ($599) + a \"magic cover\" ($60) from Loretta for my birthday this year. The \"magic cover\" is magnetic. It covers and protects the screen of the iPad2 when you're not using it and turns the machine on and off by putting the cover on and off. I also bought an $80 2-year warranty service. So all in all, without tax and shipping, we spent about $720 for the thing. The short story is the iPad2 didn't work for me. It wouldn't stay connected to our network. Every time I wanted to use it I had to go through the network settup process all over again. Apple Customer Service was no help. After hours with them I sent it in for \"repair.\" I got it back and it worked exactly the same, which is to say, it didn't work exactly as it didn't work before I sent it in. I kept asking for my money back or a credit but they kept refusing. Finally I sent it to them and they sent me a \"new\" (i.e. new to ME) unit. That's right, they did NOT say they would give me a new iPad2. They said they would give me a \"refurbished\" unit. I thought this was crappy since I'd only owned the thing for a month and had spent most of that time on the phone with their service department. Anyway, I got a \"new\" unit and it worked the same...i.e. it didn't work. Again, they refused to give me my money or a credit. So I finally just sold it. I got $400 for it so we lost about $350 (with shipping and tax).Besides not hooking up to our network, it was also big and heavy and no fun to sit and read books or browse the web or do any of the things I wanted it for. Reading a book, for example was a hassle. You had to hold this big heavy thing by the very edge of the \"frame\" because if you touched the screen anywhere it would flip through pages FAST and I spent most of my time trying to find where I left off. A real pain.Apart from all of that, the iPad2 is beautiful, has a beautiful screen and presents a beautiful, rich, colorful picture of whatever you're viewing. But not that much better than my Dell laptop.By the way, I KNOW our network works. It's the most recent Belkin WAP2 system and it works flawlessly with both of our Dell laptops, our DELL wireless color printer and our Brother wireless Laser Printer. I also had an Apple iPod Touch which worked perfectly using our same Wireless network. So it HAD to be something in the iPad2 that just didn't work. Anyway, I don't think I'll buy anything more from Apple, mainly because that even when something doesn't work right out of the box they won't give your money back or even give you a credit.What I DID buy and am very happy with, is an Amazon Kindle Latest Generation Wi Fi for $140 + $60 for a leather cover with built in reading light which actually works.The networking on the Kindle works great...just like our Dell Laptops and our printers.For more money, you can get a Kindle with not only Wi Fi but also 3G, so it will work using your phone network as well as your home network. We didn't need that feature though.The Kindle is great for reading books, magazines, newspapers, etc. You can get thousands of free books, but current books, or subscriptions to periodicals will cost you. If I was still traveling I'd get the 3G and subscribe to the NY Times but I can't read all of the news I want to (which isn't much) on my computer.What I do like, is reading books on the Kindle. You can set up your machine with the font, font size, number of words per line, etc. etc. so that everything you read is the same in terms of those features.You can shop for books at Amazon from your computer or from your Kindle using the Wi Fi or 3G system.It's black and white, but that's OK with me.It's small and light weight and very easy to use.The leather cover with built in light is a really nice feature. The light works off of the Kindle battery, which lasts about a month and charges up in less than an hour.Reading in bed, the light shines only on the Kindle page so it doesn't bother anyone else in bed with you.I've got about 100 books on my Kindle right now. All of them I got free from either Amazon or Gutenberg. When you \"buy\" from Gutenberg or some other free source you just download the file (in Kindle format) and email it to a special email address you get which is then on Amazon.Anytime you turn on your Kindle it automatically downloads whatever you've bought from Amazon or sent to Amazon from where you bought it.It also does audio books and works the same way with those. However, you have to plug in earphones of course, to listen.It holds 3500 books, so I've got plenty of room left.Anyway, if you're interested in an \"eReader\" I can recommend the Kindle over the iPad2.If you're interested in something with which to browse the web, I say, stick to a laptop.I know Apple makes some beautiful products, but I think the iPad2 is a flop for what I wanted to use it for.I think it's great for playing games on or looking at photos or maybe even watching a movie (after you've downloaded it) but I wouldn't want to try to watch a movie using \"streaming\" because of the networking issue.", "Date": "April 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "A truly useful device that makes a PC much less necessary", "Author": "S. Jentsch", "ReviewID": "R374CVRZO4753Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After five months of using a 16GB iPad 2 WiFi (no 3G), I can honestly say that it is one of the most useful technology purchases I can think of. While its price may scare many people away, its usefulness can justify its price, especially when compared to other devices that perform similar tasks. Not a day has gone by in the last five months where the iPad 2 hasn't been used several times, usually by several family members.Apple would like everyone to think that the iPad is revolutionary. Skeptics and critics scoff at the idea, but I would agree that it is a revolutionary product much in the same way that the Netbook (ASUS eeePC, et al) was a revolutionary product.Both products created a new paradigm in how you look at accessing information, media, and other tasks, and once you use them, you find it difficult to go back to the traditional devices. Netbooks nearly killed laptops, but in turn are getting killed themselves by tablets. People loved the small size of netbooks, but the keyboards and displays were often too small. Compared to an iPad, a typical netbook is too clunky and too heavy. Those with the need for a keyboard need the larger keyboard that a laptop provides, and those that don't embraced tablets as quickly as they could.Using the iPad for any length of time will make you not want to use your desktop PC for browsing the web or reading E-Mail. It's much more natural to hold a tablet in your lap or place it on the table next to you while having breakfast than it is to go into the other room and use a PC to do the same. Laptops are more portable than desktop PC's, but in comparison, they are much bulkier and many laptops have horrible battery life that don't come close to the 10 hours that one can get from the iPad 2.That's not to say that desktop and laptop PC's don't have their place. They definitely do. If you're doing anything complex that requires a keyboard or a mouse, those other devices shine. However, if you're composing a normal E-Mail, browsing the web, reading news feeds, checking Facebook, or watching videos on Hulu or YouTube, the iPad does these things very well. Typing on the on-screen keyboard, especially in landscape mode, is very easy and I've gotten quite fast at doing so. The picture quality on the screen is very good; probably better than most laptop and desktop PC monitors are, and the touch interface is so natural that it doesn't require hardly any orientation to get comfortable using the interface.Browsing the web is a joy on the 10\" screen. Sure, not having Flash compatibility is a pain sometimes, but Flash is one of those technologies of the past that is dwindling in popularity with the advent of HTML5, and it's in the site owner's best interests to develop versions of their sites that don't rely on Flash to do things that should have been done in other ways long before iOS devices came along. It's an occasional annoyance, but I don't consider the lack of Flash a dealbreaker in my mind. Web sites that don't work on the iPad are losing the business of the many that have iOS-based devices, and there are plenty of other sites that provide the same service that don't lean on the Flash crutch.Reading E-Mail using the built-in E-Mail app is also very good. I prefer the sidebar list of E-Mails that appears in landscope mode over the popup menu listing in portrait mode, but that's a personal preference. GMail integration is smooth, and being able to access multiple accounts makes it easy to check several mailboxes, either in one megalist or as separate accounts. The calendar app integrates with Google Calendar and the contacts from GMail are available in the Contacts list on the iPad as well. The integration with Google's various apps is very good.One of the best features of the iPad is the ecosystem that is built around the device. Apple has done a great job of supplying a major part of that by creating an AppStore with thousands of apps for just about every purpose one could think of. The iTunes store provides music, movies, and books for sale, but I prefer supplying my own music and movies, and Amazon's Kindle app / Kindle books is much more flexible and a better way to buy books in my opinion. On top of the software, the popularity of the iPad means that there are multitudes of accessories that cover the iPad, plug into the iPad, or otherwise complement the iPad in some way. No other portable device manufacturer has the 3rd party support that Apple has and that advantage shouldn't be overlooked.Speaking of accessories, I did a lot of looking at cases, and I settled on the AYL\u00ae 100% Premium Genuine Slim Leather Case Folio with Magnetic Closure and 3-in-1 built-in Stand for Apple Ipad 2nd Generation Tablet (Black). It's a folio style cover that works very well in protecting the device while not adding too much bulk. I highly recommend getting some kind of case, and this one is nearly perfect.The iPad 2 costs a lot of money. That makes it out of reach of some people, so it's not a slam-dunk. However, if you compare it to the cost of a new laptop or desktop PC, it's not out of line. If you're reading E-Mail, looking at videos, and browsing the web, the iPad does these things very well. You'll still need another device that will store your digital camera photos, keep track of your finances, and do the complex tasks that a desktop/laptop can do, but you'll need that device much less once you've discovered the ease of using something like this for those everyday tasks that don't require a full-sized keyboard and full-blown Windows programs to accomplish.No other tablet device currently available on the market has come close to the capabilities and the ecosystem that the iPad enjoys. I had hopes that the ASUS Eee Pad Transformer TF101-A1 10.1-Inch Tablet Computer (Tablet Only) would take it on, but it seems hampered by software issues (trying to do too much and be too flexible can be troublesome), the Androad app market still trails the iOS app market considerably, and the number of accessories available pales in comparison.The best non-iOS device that I think has a chance of being a contender is the Kindle Fire, Full Color 7\" Multi-touch Display, Wi-Fi. It has a great price point, it has Amazon standing behind it with an ecosystem that includes an AppStore, music store, video store for TV and movies, and the excellent Kindle books system, which is almost an ecosystem all by itself. I'm very interested to see how the Kindle Fire accomplishes the tasks of a tablet device and I hope that it can be a contender in the marketplace.Anyone interested in a tablet device should be looking at the major products that are available and see how those products serve their needs.

I\u2019m actually sick of reading about all of them! My ipad already does all of those things. I used mine all through community college now I\u2019m in university and I still use it hours every day. I have friends that have other kinds of tablets. One of them has the newest ipad that I like but I was also thinking about a newer kindle which another of my friends has. The kindle is nice and so is the new ipad but when looking at the screens and then looking at my ipad I LIKED my ipad2 screen better than theirs. The colors are better. IDK why. Even my friend said that the color on mine was better than her new ipad even though that one has the newer screen.I\u2019ve had mine for 3 years. Although it\u2019s older, it\u2019s still great as the new ones just not as great of a screen. The one thing I dislike is the cameras are not as great as some other tablets but I still take a lot of beautiful pictures though. But everything else is great. So, I finally realized that if I was going to buy a new tablet right now I might even buy an ipad 2 again because of how cheap they are now.", "Date": "May 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Used never looked so good", "Author": "Bradley T", "ReviewID": "R3GFZ3GFDEIXHP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After much debate and a slowly failing laptop I wanted something larger then my iPhone I could Internet research with and type short things with, iPad was on my list and I'm not crazy about getting the latest and greatest so I got this ipad2 used for less the. $300 score!

Ipads have everything you need all in one and what makes this thing so great is that it works for various and different types of people needs.Ok im from the old school days, remember when you had to carry a planner, a calendar, a calculator, a to do list, a grocery list all in your purse and before you know it, your purse had so much weight to it!!Now ipads have all of that in one and more!!Techonologhy has allowed us this generation to be more efficient and less time consumed by having gadgets like this run our busy lives.Now if you don't have an ipad you may say you don't need an ipad, but I have to say you're wrong! Whether you like to read, watch movies, listen to music, play games, surf the net, do homework, ipad should be apart of your life and will make things so much simpler.FOR KIDS:Ipad is a great learning toy, probably the best one made. It something about the huge touch screen filled with color that makes kids go crazy for it, and with all the learning apps it will trick your kid into thinking its a toy, when their learning and playing at the same time. It amazes me how now schools like elem and middle school will now be having ipads for their students. Its great because growing up i remember having tons of books in a big ole jansport the that weighed my back down.There are tons of apps available for kids and if you want your child to learn or sit still at home or in the car get your child an ipadFOR STUDENTS:If you're in college or even high school having 4 to 8 classes each class requires atleast 2 books and those books add up and are even costly. Ipad 2 can save all that and even save on buying those stocks of notebook paper. ipad 2 allows you to take notes and have all your college books stored on there. Amazing!FOR BUSY MOMS:being a mom is a very busy 24 hour job!!! And as a mom you have to keep up with appointments, doc visits for your child, birthdays, and etc. Instead of carrying a planner, calendar, and etc. Having an ipad and apps for your busy mom. schedule makes life a bit more easier.Ipads are great for every age and even grandmas/grandpas. The huge screen allows us readers to zoom in and see everything clearly.MY EXPERIENCE:At 1st when iPads came out i said i did not NEED one simply becuz Iam always glued to my computer! and than computers wasn't portable easily, i mean yes you can take it with you, but i mean can you slip it right in your purse...no! I never really left home with my laptop because i had to find wi fi and than carry it in its case, bring the plug, it just felt like too much! And than the iPhones came out! I'm like great portability, internet, email check on the go, Facebook, tweet, on the go!!!But as great as the iphones are they are made for that....to be a phone and being on the internet and etc would drain my battery and i need it for calls. but the major drawback for me was the screen, iphone 4s screen seems sooo small compared to an ipad 2So one day my husband convinced on an iPad 2 by getting me one, and i was instantly in love!!as much as I work on my computer at home, once I'm done and i want to relax and read n surf the internet n listen to some music i pull out my iPad 2 and i own a mac. I don't want a laptop on my lap while I'm laying down.And than the portability!! love it i can slip this in my purse, i don't need to bring a charger, case, and etc, just the iPad and I'm out the door.Now ipads shouldn't be computer replacements if you do most work on a computer. Now if you do a lot of homework, word docs, emailing on a iPad i would definitely suggest a keyboard, my hands hurt just typing this reviewI use my ipad for everything from listening to pandora to watching Netflix movies while I'm in the kitchen cooking. Its a great entertainment tool and saves money on electricity instead of having the tv and radio on all the time.Battery Life:When i first got the iPad 2 it felt like it took 2 days for it die even with heavy use, now after couple of months I have to charge it atleast once a day. on heavy use, it can last a couple of hours with no charge. So battery life is okTouch screen:Very responsive touch screen better than other touch screen tablets. You don't have to press hard and it quickly responds to your fingertips!Screen size:I think the screen size is a bit big, but great, I mean you can see everything so clearly and zoom in and everything is right in your face.Weight:I carry this in my purse daily and im not complaining of shoulder pain. It does add a little weight to my purse but nothing where its like omg i have to take this out my bag. In comparison its like having 2 notebooks in your bag/purseCons:Unlike most other tablets they have hdmi ports, sd slots, usb slots ipads have none of those. It would be great if it atleast can take a memory card on its own and not need to buy a accessory to attach to transfer photos.Camera:camera quality back and front sucks to me. The way phones are made now with 8 mp cameras the ipad 2 is in no comparison its camera quality is like a razor phone, when cameras on phones first came out. Like it does the job but nothing to print out and frame up.Overall I think apple did a great concept for technology by creating this and making our busy lives less hectic. iPads can be used for everything from music, to youtube, to web surfing, to email, to word docs, to reading, and so much more. If you're undecided to get an ipad, consider it. I don't think you'll regret like return it back, you ll be too in love. It is a bit pricy but than again all apple products are, and honestly coming from windows for over 12years straight and android phones for over 10 years straight i only regret not going to apple sooner.Its like having a nissan car 1st and driving a bentley after, you'll never want to go back to a nissanI love my Ipad 2, im using it now for this review and i use it every single day! happy shopping!", "Date": "December 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not What We Expected", "Author": "Samuel Claney", "ReviewID": "RWICMS4C6X4AB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I feel like all the hype around the iPad before its launch made it seem like it was going to be the greatest and most revolutionary thing since the first PC, and then it came out and there was a little disappointment because it wasn't, but now there seems to be this comfortable feeling that the iPad has nestled into our lives. It doesn't change everything, but it's great for playing games, surfing the web, and reading books while you're on the couch, or a plane, or a bus.

Also the camera isnt even barely a megapixel the quality of the images are horrible and you have a vga front facing camera.Overall: this is a great buy because the amount of application offered from apple's App Store benefits you more than Androids app store.

It's probably more of the limitations of the Android OS that is so frustrating to me, and the lack of real world applications for it.  Yes it has an abundance of applications, but no real apps to do work it seems.iPad 2 has apps like Pages and Numbers that integrate seamlessly with their counterparts on the computer.  On the other hand Android devices have something called Quickoffice PRO which is supposed to allow you to edit and transfer Office documents between the device and the desktop...  sounds good, but after paying $14.00 for the app I cannot use ANY document with ANY type of formatting on the Android, and the smaller screen makes it hardly usable.  In contrast the only issues I have with Pages is if there is a font that is not available on the iPad, but is on the desktop computer, and I can always find another one that will fit the bill.The iPad 2 is way ahead of Androids in terms of touchscreen recognition.  The Android was constantly doing things that I didn't want it to do.  For instance I would be attempting to scroll the screen and often times it would instead select an item or link from the screen.  That was uber-frustrating at best.  Trying to do anything on it was a labor of love I guess.  I oft times just got frustrated and moved to a computer to get something done.  The iPad by contrast seems to know exactly whatI am trying to do...  rarely do I have a touchscreen error.The iPad 2 is sleek, elegant, and has a large enough screen to actually get some work done.  Surfing the web is a breeze and despite the complaints about the lack of a flash plug-in, I surf with relative ease.  Speaking of flash, yes Androids have that, but it doesn't work very well on them.  I struggled on web sites with flash on my Android.  Often times the page would not display correctly anyway, so that's kind of a wash.  And Microsoft is canning flash in Windows 8 as well.  It looks like Steve was right... flash is going away.iOS 5 with iCloud is an iDream (pun intended).  I can sync all my contacts, my wife's contacts, calendars, Aperture photos, etc...  without any real user interaction.  Just turn the services on and go.  Makes me re-think that OS X Lion Server purchase I made, but I still need that for the older Macs running Tiger and Leopard on my network, and at some point I will probably turn on that XSAN server to create a local SAN RAID...Numbers files work perfectly and seamlessly between the iPad 2 and the desktop computer, formulas, etc.  That's another problem I had with the Android Quickoffice, it would not understand complex and sometimes simple formulas, so I couldn't use spreadsheets on it at all.Generally the applications for iOS are far more mature and polished than those available for Android.  The user experience is without a doubt far superior on the iPad 2, apps like Hulu Plus were not even available on the Android which sort of left me scratching my head.  I do have an Android phone that has Hulu Plus on it, so I'm not certain why there wasn't one for the tablet, but it rendered what could have been a nice TV show watching device into a useless for TV device.iPad 2 is sleek, sexy, stylish, yes.  But it is also a serious workhorse if you are like me and want to do real world work on it.  With a combination of the iPad, and iWork.com I am able to create documents on the iPad or desktop computer, save them to iWork.com, and download them anywhere in any of three possible formats (Pages, PDF, or Word).  The translation to word documents is nearly as flawless as the other transfers, again, sometimes there is a font issue, but that is rare and is easy to fix.Another problem I had with the Android was the lack of iTunes for it.  Much of my music library is still DRM protected and the Android wouldn't play those files.  iPad 2 by contrast sync's right up and has every one of my songs available to play, and speaking of iCloud -- I have more computers than I need, and having that many leads to problems like the old \"you can only have 5 computers authorized\" when I try to authorize another iTunes library to sync my music.  iCloud eliminates that problem, your new purchases automatically are downloaded from the cloud. And storage is not really an issue with iPad 2 specifically... get the Camera Adapter kit and you can use all the SD cards you want with it.Back to the iPad 2 - if you are looking to buy a tablet type of computer and are on the fence between an iPad and another, shall I say \"knock-off\", dig into the details.Some of the Androids may be better than the Nook Color in terms of power, response, screen size, etc... but none of them have a decent office suite or iTunes, they don't have as many accessories available for them, you'll have to use a variety of different services to get iCloud functionality, you cannot use iWork.com with them, Apps are not as abundant and generally are not as mature/polished, syncing with your desktop is a headache - if you can even get it to, etc...Overall this is one of the best, if not THE best Apple product available.

Although I have multiple iPods and also an iPhone owner, this is the first time we are getting ourselves an iPad in the household.This is wonderful device. Just like what they did in the IpodTouch, the amazing thing is how they were able to squeezed so much technology in such a small space.By the way, this is a review of the iPad 2.  The first iPad, we skipped it completely.  There are many tablets in the market but it is really tough to compete with iPad. First, the interface.  This is what Apple is known for.  The simplicity, usability and ease of use of such a very compliated hardware is a miracle in itself.  I have tried other devices that are similar but the most of them seems to be  a  tad slower and  less smart.Another big factor that is strongly going for the iPad is the number of apps availalble in the Apple store.  Android is starting to compete, specially now with big online stores like Amazon taking the challenge.  Still, it will take some time to really match the number and the quality of the apps in iTunes. Apple is also known for being strict in approving apps being sold in the App store.Funny thing is, what made me pull the trigger to finally buy an iPad despite the high tag price is the HP Touchpad fiasco.  I ordered one when it was advertised for $99.  I was ecstatic to have my order received and placed through Barnes & Noble,  only to be notified the next day that my order was cancelled.  Due to frustration, I walked in to the closest Apple store and got me one.What really amazed me is the usefullness of the tablet in education. I have heard so many times that it is good for kids who have autism and one of my kids was diagnosed with autism. He is so focused when playing with it.My kids have DSs but most of the games are just for fun and entertainment. They get a little bit of learning at the beginning, but after that it is repetitive and just time waste.There are amazing educational apps like the following:- Word Bingo- Math Bingo- Teach Me- Presidents vs Aliens- Stack the States.- Brainquests series- Write On (for learning cursive writing)NO FLASH:iPad2 still does not support flash.  There are Aps that you can use to play flash on websites  like iShifter, etc.  It is not perfect but at least it works.SKYPE:One of the advantages the iPad2 against iPad1 is that now you can do video calls with Skype or Yahoo Messenger.", "Date": "October 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "A terrific product", "Author": "Tink", "ReviewID": "R1BWW2OK3V8TP1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had been debating whether I wanted a Kindle or an I-pad.

Bugs and other device problems aren't something you come to expect from Apple because of the tireless work that goes into making sure the manufactured parts work together in harmony. This was something manufacturers of other tablets did not do when they rushed their way to the market Apple was claiming all to itself. The result was a number of products, most of which had bugs or other serious performance problems.Anyway, the iPad 2 bulked up a bit from its predecessor. A dual core processor and a little more RAM helped keep this device up with the Johnsons, spec-wise. Usability-wise, it's still as friendly to the user as can be. The interface isn't complicated and anyone familiar with how an iPhone works will have no problem getting into this device right away.Cameras on front and back were added. It's a shame they couldn't get a HD camera sensor in the device because that would make Facetime all the better. As it is, the video quality isn't that great but it does what it says it does and the video chat function works pretty nice. The back camera? Never used it and don't plan to.Then there is the App Store itself. Instead of paying $69.99 every time you need to feed your kid's hunger for a new game, you can drop 99 cents for most applications, whether they are games or educational apps or any of the vast amount of programs created that fit anyone's budget. As tablets become more and more popular, more and more content is finding its way onto the device. ABC has a player where you can watch their new shows in their entirety. HBO has one, too. Doctors are using these devices as they make patient records easily available. Teachers use these to track grades for their classes and educational apps help them figure out what subject matter their students may be struggling with. And these are just two niche examples of what the device can do. As an everyday consumer, you can really shape this device around your life and even find applications that make your professional life easier.For a portable, in your bed experience, this works wonders. The backlight trims when it detects low lighting so your eyes won't strain. The 10 inch screen is more than enough for watching Netflix or other content you can stream (I use AirVideo since I have a lot of media on my home machine and it streams it all -- .AVI, .MKV, .MP4 -- perfectly).If you take this wifi model out of the house and find yourself in places where you don't have wifi access, you can still use whatever apps you have that don't require an Internet connection, or you can play videos that you store on the device. Since this is Apple we're talking about, you can find apps that will play any kind of media so you aren't stuck with just the .MP4 codec that Apple would prefer you use.There aren't many limitations to the device...Adobe Flash support is usually cited among the things people don't like about the device. Good news on that front: Adobe is abandoning Flash for mobile devices (in part because they can't fix the non-stop security holes Flash has) so eventually that won't be a concern. Steve Jobs said Adobe Flash was garbage and didn't get support for it with the iPad. Other manufacturers chose to include Flash but it didn't take long before they admitted it killed the battery life on their devices, while the iPad2 can go all day without needing a charge. Watch movies all day. Play games all day. You don't need this hooked up to a power outlet all the time like you would a laptop and this is much easier to carry around, so the number of situations you can use this device (waiting rooms, long car trips, air travel) goes way up.There are many things to like about this device and there are some drawbacks (no USB support besides tethering to your computer, no HDMI, no Adobe Flash and no expanded memory card slots. But they are few and nearly insignificant when you realize there are alternatives to the roadblocks you think you may face, including cloud storage.This tablet is the cream of the crop. There is some good competition out there but the ease-of-use, availability of 70,000 plus apps in the Apple app store, plus how dependable the device is keeps Apple on the throne of best tablet manufacturer.", "Date": "November 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Simplified Everything!", "Author": "LF2011", "ReviewID": "R52PF2HED3Y8V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not a tech guy. In fact, I generally loathe having to deal with computers and technology. Unfortunatly, since I own my own business I spend a large part of my day sending e-mails, processing orders, and doing book keeping, so much of my day is spent interacting with technology. I also spend a good portion of my day on the road, and until recently I had to lug my laptop around. Whenever I found down time, wherever I was, I'd have to bring it out, wait for it to boot up, log on to the internet, get my work done, then wait for it to shut down. It got the job done, but it was heavy and awkward to carry around, and uncomfortable to use in the car.I'd been considering switching to a tablet for a long time, and when I finally decided to go ahead and make the switch I researched every tab on the market. I spent a lot of time testing tabs at the electronics stores. Some just weren't very intuitive, and getting them to perform required more effort than I was willing to invest. Some were choppy. Some seemed to crash every 5 minutes.The one that always operated beautifully was the Ipad 2. Unfortunately, my business requires that I watch videos my clients send me, and the lack of flash support worried me. Ultimately I decided I could use the Ipad on the road and watch whatever videos I couldn't get to play when I got home to my computer.Set up was very easy - and I'm not the most computer literate guy. Downloaded Itunes, plugged the Ipad in, and it was up and running. Within an hour the lack of flash support became annoying... Then I did a bit of research and found an App for $4.99 that allowed me to view flash on my Ipad flawlessly! The Ipads one limitation was solved for less than $5.00! Now I have Apps that simplify every element of my business. Maps, record keeping, creating documents...The Ipad is wonderful to travel with. Day to day, on the road locally, it is light and slim, easy to take with my wherever I go. When I need to access records or check my e-mail I no longer have to wait for my laptop to boot up, with the touch of a button my Ipad is up and running, and on the internet moments later.The battery life is stunning... It keeps me entertained and/or productive on long flights, and in hotel rooms in unfamiliar cities.I very rarely use my laptop since I got my Ipad. My Ipad does everything my laptop did for me, only it usually does it faster and easier. In fact, the main thing I wish I could change about the Ipad is the fact that it needs a computer to sync with (though it only needs to do this very rarely)... I wish it were a completely independant device so I could just set my laptop aside completely and let it gather dust.The Ipad isn't 100% perfect. The camera isn't impressive at all. Watching flash requires downloading and using a seperate web browser app (I generally use Safari, overall its a better browser than the flash enabled one. When I run into a flash issue, I copy the address, open the Photon app and paste the address there) It's slightly annoying to have to take the extra steps, but it's not a huge issue.Overall, I couldn't be happier with it!", "Date": "September 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "OK gift", "Author": "A Scott", "ReviewID": "R3LDFTAAZWXXHU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got this as a gift.

My biggest reason for wanting an iPad 2 was I found the screen of the touch too small to surf the web or read a book, I wanted GPS (have to get the 3G model for that), camera (we use FaceTime a lot keeping in touch with family) and 3G for internet access for when we travel and are at places with no wifi.  I spend many hours at various sporting practices each week and for the past two years, the touch has kept me entertained (I actually looked forward to practice since it gave me at least two hours to sit and catch up on everything).The iPad has taken it to a whole new level.  I have more reading material than I can read (books, magazines, email, etc.).  I love Netflix and HBO GO and I use it to stargaze at night (it can control my telescope through an app).  The entire family likes it so much that It's made the touches obsolete.  My husband who never liked the touch keeps taking my iPad.  The best part for me is that I am no longer chained to the computer.  I can read the news and check my calendar at the kitchen table or the over stuffed chair while having me coffee.  The only thing I've been using the laptop for is syncing.My complaints are that I can no longer use my computer to charge the iPad (the car charger is also obsolete for the iPad.  I had to but a new one).  I also purchased two extra long USB cables and an extra charging brick as the cords that come with it are too short to charge and sit comfortably on the couch.  I also found that I can no longer use my Altec Lansing speaker dock to play music so that's something else I'll want to replace eventually.I purchased 1GB of data from Verizon for $20 for the month to see how far it would go.  I've been pleasantly surprised.  I may run out of time to use it before I run out of data.

Naturally, I was impressed at how quick and easy it was to use.  A lot of thought has gone into the product and it shows.  Instant on (I have the magnetic cover) is a bonus and the screen - large and crystal clear - is not so much a selling point but rather a \"how to\" example for other tablet manufacturers to follow.The Apple store in the meatpacking district of New York City has a qualified, and very friendly, staff who set the unit up for me while they answered my various questions. Considering that they had been doing this since 5 PM and it was now after 10, that is a lot of dedication for one staff!  The most amazing thing is: they were all quite proud of the iPad 2. It says a lot when the company employees are that loyal.And the iPad 2 deserves such praise.  The product is, in short, wonderful.  Light weight yet with a solid feel to it, I plan on taking mine to Europe shortly.  After you turn it on, the balance of the iPad 2 is self-explanatory.  From the opening screen of icons, the touch screen makes it almost too-easy to take the product that seriously. But it is a useful tool what with a Calendar, notebook, iPod, photo studio, etc. Naturally the much hearalded APP STORE is there and works fine and at a lightning speed.  Although I wonder about the \"10 hour battery life\" claim - it does manage to work long enough to please the most diligent of users.Where the iPad falls short is in the area of productivity.  Much discussed, and a sore point, is the lack of a USB port. In todays day and age, that is almost an unforgivable sin. I did get the hook up so I could download my pictures (it works too - and, again, it does it so fast and so effortlessly that it is a minor miracle). There is something almost childish in the decision not to include at least one USB port especially after the loud fracas that happened after the release of the first iPad.  FLASH is another sore point and, frankly, one that I don't understand. There is some conflict going on with the world of APPLE and flash so we don't have it. This makes it very difficult to surf the web. Safari is quick but without flash, it misses one of its major components. Again, and this is just my feeling, this is something that could have been corrected quite easily - starting a year ago with the original.  Now, the iPad 2 (and the original version, I'm sure) can still do quite an amazing amount of work without these two features but as they are considered standard, it is a puzzle as to why the iPad 2 did not have both of them installed.  Also, the lack of a port decreases the iPad's place in the workforce. How can you install, let's say, OFFICE MAC?  The system can print (via Bluetooth) so it could be used as an Office-on-the-run (held landscape, the keyboard is quite easy to do some very fast typing upon - one could produce an awful lot of work on it but . . . without a CD drive to install programs, it makes it difficult).Other than that, the unit is nothing short of brilliant.

Frankly, there are three major differences between the original iPad and the iPad 2.  First, the iPad 2 is noticeably lighter and sleeker.  It is more comfortable to hold for longer periods of time, especially if you like to read e-newspaers or ebooks. Secondly, the iPad 2's processor is a lot speedier.  Page turns are quick, boot time is fast, and surfing the internet is a breeze. Last of all, the iPad 2 has a camera. This, however, is its weakest feature. Do not expect the same results you would get from a digital camera or digital webcam. (I could have lived with a model that has no camera.) The other differences are minor (e.g., the automatic turn on/turn off feature). For me, the iPad 2 is a better product for what I needed (reading and surfing the net).

I can't stand the way that Apple nickle and dimes you for everything. Almost every App on iTunes costs money, where as most Apps on Play are free. My wife's iPhone 4S was having problems the other day, so I called Apple Care. I was told that I needed to create an Apple Care account for $29.99, just so I could talk to a customer service rep!.......Are you freaking kidding me?! What kind of costumer service is that? Ok, here's your iPad, want to personalize it?..........Too bad! Want to hook it to your TV, without buying a $100 Apple TV module?.............Too Bad!Want to use a YouTube app?.........Too bad! Want to use Google maps?..........Too bad! Want to use your Gmail account without it being gliche?........Too bad! Want to use Google search engine, without it constantly saying, \"Invalid URL\"?...........Too bad! Here's your iPad. Take it or leave it. You can't personalize it or do what you want, because we are Apple, the most powerfull cooperation in the world, and we know what you want way more than you do.My next tablet or phone will NEVER be Apple,  but if all the people like being bent over and having it stuck in their pooper, by all means keep throwing your money at Apple. Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice; shame on me.People keep comparing the hardware and software of current Android tablets vs. Apple iPads, but that isn't the issue.

Since I never had the iPad 1 I'm still learning how to use it, although it is somewhat similar to my 3rd generation iPod touch. The iPad 2 has a lot of nice features built in such as a video/picture camera and FaceTime. What I really don't like about my iPad is that I can't download Adobe or watch shows on Hulu or any other website without paying fees. These are things that I can do on my regular laptop at no extra cost. Apple is forcing the iPad purchasers to use iTunes or to pay extra fees elsewhere. If I had known this from the start I would have returned the iPad and bought a tablet. If you don't like watching videos online or you don't mind paying extra fees then the iPad is great. As for me I am not happy with it.Update 12/28/11: iPad now offers Apps for ABC and TV.com for CBS so I can watch shows from these networks for free and I don't have to purchase them from iTunes. The iPad is still restrictive compared to some tablets, but I'm going to change my rating from 2 stars to 4 stars. iPad is equal or superior to most tablets currently on the market, but I just wish that it wasn't so restrictive in some cases.", "Date": "September 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "It's an iPad - It's not a Computer !", "Author": "Wade Arnold \"thecirclesoflife\"", "ReviewID": "R12WZIV424X01R", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Before you go jumping off into Hightech Hysteria, think about what you want to do with what you might be buying.

If you're still debating between the iPad 1 and the iPad 2 check out my review of the first generation iPad right here on Amazon to see a discussion of its strengths and weaknesses with a number of people commenting (both positively and negatively) over the past 11 months.Let me begin by saying this upfront, I don't work for Apple, I don't own Apple Stock, and whether you buy an iPad, Xoom, a laptop or a pad of paper and pencil I don't get anything for writing this. I'm not an Apple \"fanboy\" although I can give credit where credit is due and lately Apple has deserved a lot of credit for some of their products.Physical CharacteristicsThe iPad 2 is absurdly thin. More importantly than it's thinness is its tapered edge which feels more natural in your hand. One of the biggest complaints about the original iPad was it really wasn't tremendously comfortable to hold for long periods at a time. For a tablet device designed to be held, that's a pretty big deal. Apple really has done an amazing job of cramming everything into an even smaller space than before and the difference is really noticeable when you're holding the device. In addition to the tapered edge, Apple managed to reduce the overall weight of the iPad 2. That might not seem like a huge deal to most, especially when you consider the weight difference isn't tremendous when you're already under 2 pounds, but I spend a good part of my day holding the iPad in my hands and the weight difference is surprising by the end of the day. The first generation isn't heavy by any means, but the iPad 2 outshines it.New and \"Improved\"Apple doubled the RAM in the iPad 2 from 256MB to 512MB. What does that mean? For most casual users, probably not a whole lot. There is a performance bump that everyone will see the effects of in things like loading times for webpages that are open in the background, but 256MB was sufficient for most daily use and games. If you're planning to use your device for some of the more graphically intense games the iPad 2 does offer a better method of graphics processing that'll help deliver faster images with fewer jerky movements. If you're just playing Angry birds and reading e-mail you're not going to know the difference.The screen is the same for all real purposes. It is technically a \"new\" part in that it isn't identical to the old, it's a bit thinner and more efficient, but it's the same resolution. The Glass is thinner though, and this amounts to a fair bit of the weight loss from one generation to the next. In playing with the device it seems surprising but despite feeling lighter it actually feels more sturdy in your hands. I still wouldn't suggest dropping it, but if it were to fall the iPad 2 certainly feels like it might stand a better chance to survive. Try not to drop it though.The addition of 2 cameras was expected. Some were a bit surprised to see the first generation released without the cameras. Whether it was for a price point consideration, or a means to get people to upgrade, Apple held off until iPad 2. The cameras do a reasonable job, but they're not going to replace a dedicated digital camera, or really even the camera on your phone for most still images. The cameras do a substantially better job with video, and FaceTime is probably one of the best reasons to get the iPad 2 over the original iPad. For those who might not be familiar, FaceTime is Apple's face to face conferencing system, kind of like Skype, or if you'd rather, kind of like the Jetson's TV/Phone. With the push of a button you can be having a face to face chat with a loved one just about anywhere in the world (provided they're on a wireless network at the time). FaceTime doesn't work over 3G natively (it can be used over a wifi connection created by a 3G device however) so you're not going to be able to use it in your car anytime soon. This is probably a good thing though. It is incredibly easy to use and if you know other people with an iPad 2, iPhone 4, or Mac it's a lot of fun.Smart Covers aren't really \"smart\" but they're really very useful. Not only do they provide a stylistic enhancement of the device, but they serve a practical and functional purpose of doubling as a screen protector and stand in 2 configurations. You can find them in a variety of colors and from third market suppliers, and it's a safe bet that more will be out soon to capitalize on the magnetic sensors in the iPad 2. It's unfortunate that this same feature can't somehow be retrofitted to the iPad 1, I wouldn't have thought a case would be a compelling reason to consider a product over it's competitor, but these covers are really so useful it's hard to understand why they've not been there since the beginning.Multitasking SupportOne of the biggest knocks against the iPad when first released was the lack of native multi-tasking support. Jailbreakers added the feature quickly and Apple soon realized it would be a requirement for any future device's success and released an OS update that included the feature. The iPad 2 capitalizes on that progress and takes it a step further with the increased RAM enabling more open applications to be suspended at once, and the time to open or close an application has improved as well. That said, even the first generation managed to open and close apps faster than most people would be used to on their computers, so while this is an improvement it's more akin to showing off.AppsOne thing that Apple has clearly the advantage in for the moment is app availability. The App store has close to 70,000 iPad specific Apps, all of which will work on the iPad 2. The new cameras will undoubtedly see this list expand rapidly, as will the inclusion of a gyroscope for gaming and motion based uses. There are also a substantial number of professional applications ranging from document creation to photo editing and vector drawing. Chances are if you can dream it, there's an App for that (and if not you might want to get started on one to fill in the gap). The Android market is making a strong showing, and ultimately it'll likely be a strong competitor, for now it still has a ways to go, but any potential buyer should consider the strength of the application market before buying a tablet.Pros:Weight. Seriously. The minimal weight of this thing is by far the most impressive feature about it in my opinion. It seems to defy physics and logic that so much could be in such a small space working that hard for that long.Battery Life. From full to dead my iPad 2 went just over 11 hours with the movie Robin Hood showing twice during that time, the screen at half brightness, wifi turned on, an Angry Birds marathon and a good portion of a book in ibook. That's better than a work day and that's constantly on.Books. This is definitely a Pro, but reading itself could go either way. The great benefit to the iPad is having access to Google Books, ibook, Nook, and Kindle. This allows for some comparison shopping and price competition (although for the most part they're all usually about the same). Reading in the evenings in bed is great as the back light means you don't have to worry about keeping others awake, but the glass screen causes some glare trouble when trying to read outside or near a sunny window. If you're an avid outdoor reader the Kindle might still be your best bet.Cons:Still no dedicated USB support. While there is a camera add-on that allows for certain USB devices to be used there is no option for mass storage. Some of the Android Tablets allow for this and if you find yourself wanting to use your tablet as a standalone storage device this might be something to consider. The device can read from certain flash drives though, but is largely limited to photo and video files. Jailbreaks offer solutions to this, but those come with their own issues as well.Still no dedicated SD card slot. This is troublesome on two fronts. First, if you want to import pictures from your camera you have to have an adapter which is just one more thing to carry around. Second, the lack of expansion means you're limited to what you purchase in terms of storage. I purchased a 32GB iPad last time and never filled it up completely, so for me capacity wasn't an issue. If you want to be able to have your entire movie collection with you though... you may want to consider whether the iPad 2 can meet your space requirements.HDMI output. Really this is a Pro and a Con. The iPad does allow for HD output over HDMI but again it requires an adapter. All of these adapters are additional purchases for features that some tablets offer built in. This can be a pain, but then again if you're not likely to ever use HDMI Output then you're not paying for something you won't use.No Flash Support. This is becoming less and less of an issue as the internet and web developers are moving away from Flash for many websites, but there are a lot still out there relying on Adobe's Flash to run properly (including a lot of web based games). Before you pick a tablet consider what kind of websites you frequent and try and determine if they are Flash driven or not. If they are you may really want to consider something from the Android offerings as it is expected that they'll have at least some Flash support.If you're in the market for a tablet device the iPad 2 should definitely be on your short list. If you're uncertain it is always best to go and play with these things hands on first if you can. Best Buy is a good place for that, so are Verizon Stores since they have the Xoom and 3G iPad. Don't get pulled into the hype and mania that comes with an Apple release. They're exciting and new, and they're impressive enough to warrant some excitement, but it will die down and there will be other products that prove a strong competitor to the iPad 2. If you're looking for right now though, this is probably your best bet. I gave the device 4 stars, as I did the iPad 1. I did this in contemplation of the features offered by competitors that are absent from the iPad, most notably the requirement for adapters for USB/SD/HDMI. While these features are there, they aren't as convenient as in other tablets. With that in mind I firmly believe that the iPad more than makes up for this in usability, reliability, and design and in those areas far exceeds its current competitors.", "Date": "March 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nothing ground breaking here.", "Author": "Bubba", "ReviewID": "R3C23RDV8I3RHH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Really people? For the money this thing is stripped down. They just now add a forward and back facing camera and everyone is like ooh cool. This feature has been on cell phones forever. It should of been added on the original ipad. Think about it. A cell phone has more features than an ipad. Smartphones now have high resolution front and rear facing cameras with flash, able to use the flash as a flashlight, sd card slots, cable hook up to t.v's, wifi, usb, physical keypads, can download music without proprietary software, and so on. All in one little package. Now don't tell me they don't have room on an ipad to add any features.Yes they made this a little lighter and a little faster. But for the price you can buy a powerful laptop or netbook that will leave the ipad 2 in the dust. And you won't have to pay for proprietary cables or accessories for dowloading your pictures, files, music etc. like the camera kit, which doesn't work for all cameras or memory cards to transfer pictures. And don't forget you have to pay for all the Mac apps. And oh you want a physical keyboard? More money. Wait you better buy a protective case to protect your new investment that probably is adding up to almost a grand now. That's where Apple gets you. You have to buy their proprietary products and services. And they will add features and memory upgrades a little at a time to newer models so you will want the latest features. Just like their ipods and itouches.If you are thinking about replacing a computer with this, then read on. If not, then read elswhere.All that said...if you want to do work on it, consider getting a loaded netbook which is a better value and more powerful, more memory and you don't have to go through the hassle of downloading or uploading to another computer like you would have with an ipad. With a netbook you can just load data onto an sd card or thumb drive if you want to instantly. What if you don't have a computer around with an ipad and you want to transfer some files or pictures onto it or want to just download some files and take it with you on a thumb drive. Oh wait did you remember to bring the cables or adapter with you on top of that? Do you want adapters protuding from your expensive ipad waiting to be bumped and snapped off? Also do you use Windows or Mac? Is your printer cabable of over the air printing? If not then you have to either get a capable printer or transfer the data onto a computer that is hooked up to your printer. If it were not for the touchscreen, would anyone buy an ipad? HECK NO! It would be considered a featurless outdated piece of equipment comparable to something about 10 plus years ago. See where i'm going here. But on the same note, a netbook is not as portable. So weigh out your wants and needs. I ended up getting a netbook after research and playing with them and no regrets because I can do anything on it and it is a spare because the kids take up the other computer. I couldn't of done much with the ipad except surf the web. Example, my wifes work computer crashed and she was working from home. Well luckily she had the netbook because she hooked up the netbook to her lcd monitor and logged into a computer at her work place remotely and kept on working. And I also had the netbook hooked up another time to my flatscreen, an external hard drive, mouse, and an sd card in the slot so I could edit pictures, back them up and print them. I also had an extra usb port to spare where I could of had a phone plugged in to charge at the same time my netbook was charging also. Couldn't of done all this with an ipad let alone charge it at the same time if you had something plugged into it's single proprietary port. Get at least an 11.6 inch netbook if you decide on one and still want functionality and portability. Everything fits on the screen better and not crammmed in. Keep in mind though that some netbooks come with just Windows starter and not a full working edition. If you don't get the full working edition, then the netbook would not be of much use. But oh when I just want to lounge around and surf the web, I wish I had a tablet. But I use my phone for that, lame but it works. Oh yeah, I can tether my phone to the netbook also.Personally I think this is mainly usefull for surfing the web or used as an electronic organizer for someone on the move who has to keep track of a lot of information or carries a clipboard i.e. invoices, work orders, short note taking, etc. or needs visual images out in the field. But to use in place of a real computer, no. You can buy apps. for the ipad to do some work on, but they are not as powerful. So think about what you want or need it for. Ask yourself something like this. Do you need something portable for school where you can do term papers and homework on, or for organizing and socializing? This is not a replacement for a computer if that's what you want. It is a media device with limitations features wise. Also with a netbook you can have a spare battery and swap it out and continue on. With an ipad you have to plug it in and wait for it to charge and it defeats the purpose of mobility doesn't it? Yes you ipad defenders, I know the battery charge lasts pretty long, but there are variables affecting it like what you are running and what if you forgot to plug it in overnight and you don't have time to charge it.I'm not saying a tablet doesn't have it's place because it does. And yes I know that an ipad and a netbook are two different things. But it may not serve your needs so be aware. I can see where an ipad or any other tablet would be more practical or even a no brainer because a clamshell design of a netbook might be just to clunky. I'm just pointing out the lack of features on the ipads. If they only would add a memory card slot or standard usb to make it simple to transfer data or so I can hook up other peripherals. I don't want to pull out cables or turn on my computer and sync it everytime I want to transfer data. But don't hold your breath. They want you to buy another one with more memory if you need more. A memory slot or usb would give you the option of adding more memory of your own. And it won't take you long to fill up the little memory the ipad offers if you like to load media onto it.Size and price should be taken into consideration if you want to use it for entertainment away from home a lot. There are several tablets offered from competitors now and some are less expensive, more features, smaller and lighter and don't use a lot of proprietary cables or software applications or hardware, they have sd slots and or usb also. Something you might want to think about if you like to dowload or upload stuff on the fly and travel light. But it comes down to you to research ask questions and try to get some hands on to \"see what works best for you\". Just don't expect that all the tablets perform the same or offer the same apps. Your not going to get ipad performance or huge selection of apps. to choose from compared to a tablet that costs way less. If you just want it to take on vacation while relaxing next to the pool or to keep kids entertained then a less expensive tablet might fit your needs so you can still enjoy yourself and not have to worry as much about it getting stolen, lost, or broken. As for the ipad, you might be to concerned with it to enjoy yourself or it is just too big and a 7 inch tablet is more convienient. But if you want your cake and eat it too. Take a look at the Asus Transformer and Asus Slider. The transformer has a detatchable keyboard with a mouse pad and battery that extends your battery life, two sd slots, USB ports, and you can adjust the angle of the screen and close it like a netbook. The slider has a keyboard build into the tablet and screen flips up. No mousepad though. But there is a USB port that you can hook up a mouse to if you want. Also with the Asus tablets you can multitask and listen to something in the background while doing something else. With the ipad you can't. The Asus tablets support flash and you are able to watch clips on web pages, whereas the ipad you don't get to watch the clips because most clips are flash. The Asus tablets will fit movies on to the screen better and not have the black bars on the top like on the ipad. People are even getting rid of their ipads to get the Asus. There are also a few tablets out there that run Microsoft Windows. So that was just an example of other opions you have out there. Another thing to think about is that there are a lot of phones running on Android as for tablets also. So there is going to be a lot more compatibility between devices because most of them will run on Android. With Apple your limited with their products and don't have other outside options. The tide will turn with more offerings for Android because it will become main stream because most devices and manufacturers now are adapting the Android platform,while the \"I\" line of products are only exclusive to Apple. Will be like the Beta max vs VHS. Beta had better quality but most manufacturers adapted the VHS format instead of Beta. Well Beta died because everyone was making VHS products.Don't slam me if your an ipad lover. It's just things to think about. Don't know why people get so defensive about negative reviews about this thing. They must be the ones replacing their old Apple stuff with the newer models that have the newest inovation (cough, cough). What's new for next year? A flash for the camera? Or wait, maybe a phone feature. That way you can get rid of your cell phone and only carry the ipad around and not have to carry both. There are a lot of fan boys out there defending the ipad with not much to back it up and they take it personal. I think they are in denial and trying to justify their purchase. Well people you are the ones Apple preys on and you fall for it.Update: I finally broke down and got an Acer 7 inch A100 tablet for my daughter for Christmas. And after using it for a while, I will still stand by what said about the limitations and uses of a tablet. And the Acer A100 is only 7 inches perfect size for holding for long periods of time or for traveling instead of a bulky 10 inch. it can keep up with the ipad2 and has ports for micro sd, micro usb, micro HDMI, and hey even a flash for one of the two cameras. Hear that? A simple flash for the camera. Oooh...Oh wait, the ipad3 might get that, can't wait, it will make it the best ipad ever.

Martin \"Darkbard\"", "ReviewID": "RWI1G903IDI3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Apple iPad.  Those of us who own one have recently been called less than flattering names for daring to use it and enjoying the experience!  But the devices' popularity is growing; indeed I am seeing them everywhere.  Just yesterday I sat next to a woman at my local Ford dealership who was reading a book on her iPad even as I held a text message conversion with a good friend while reading the news from CNN and NPR.For me the device fulfills several different functions I have been meaning to purchase in separate devices, like an e-book reader, portable music player for my master bedroom, and electronic photo frame.  Why buy all three of those devices when the Apple iPad does all three functions in one neat silver (albeit expensive) package?  And since buy my iPad in the Fall of last year, the uses for the device have grown tenfold, until now, it is almost indispensable.Now Apple has released the iPad 2 and those of us who use the original are throwing them over for the next big, or should I say smaller thing.  Since this new one was for the business I work for I decided to do a one for one replacement of the one I already used for testing purposes; in other words I ordered an \"iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G\" version.The \"iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi /3G\" FactsOn the surface the iPad 2 is not demonstratively different from the iPad Original.  Featuring a Dual-core (Apple designed) 1 GHz A5 processor, the 1.33 pound (1.34 pounds for the 3G) iPad 2 is notably thinner than the iPad Original, though the screen size stays the same.  The other big changes: two camera, one rear facing, the other front facing now ship standard with all models; and the graphics are reportedly 9 times as fast.No matter what hardware version (Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi/3G, 16GB, 32GB, or 64GB) you chose the Ultra-Portable, iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/ 3G is a simple device with very few moving parts.  The power button sits on the top of the device on the right, while a standard 3.5mm headphone jack is situated on the far left.  Along the right edge of the 0.5\" thick iPad you'll find the screen lock/mute and volume control switches, while the bottom of the 9.56\" long device is reserved for speakers and the USB/power port.  The USB port is proprietary so, no, like the iPad Original you cannot plug a USB memory stick into it, but with the provided cord you can plug it into your computer and into an outlet to recharge the device.The \"iPad 2\" (also available in black and white body styles) can be had with 16GB, 32GB, or 64GB of memory, and all iterations are fitted with a 1GHz Apple A5 custom-designed, high performance, low-power processor.  Internet connectivity is through either Wi-Fi (802.11a/b/g/n), and or 3G: UMTS/HSDPA (850, 1900, 2100 MHz) and GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz).  Bluetooth 2.1 EDR is also provided with either configuration.  A 4G model of the iPad2 has not been announced.The 9.7-inch fingerprint resistant LED-backlit glossy widescreen multi-touch color display offers 1024x768 resolution and can display multiple languages and characters simultaneously.  The IPad 2 is fitted with an ambient light sensor and the device supports 576p and 480p with Apple Component AV Cable; 576i and 480i with Apple Composite AV Cable and 1024x 768 with Dock Connector to VGA adapter.The back camera can be used for HD (720p) video recording of up to 30 frames per second with audio, as well as still camera with 5x zoom.  The front camera can also be used for (VGA) video recording of up to 30 frames per second with audio, as well as still camera pictures.New Apps that ship with the iPad 2 include FaceTime a real-time video chat application that allows you to calls someone else's iPad 2, iPhone 4, new iPod touch, or Mac over Wi-Fi and establish a video chat session.  The App will not work via 3G.  The other new App is Photo Booth an application that allows you to take pictures of yourself with various effects.Audio playback response frequency is 20Hz - 20,000Hz and the iPad 2 supports the following audio formats:o  HE-AAC (V1)o  AAC (16 to 320 Kbps)o  Protected AAC (from iTunes Store)o  MP3 (16 to 320 Kbps)o  MP3 VBRo  Audible (formats 2, 3, and 4)o  Apple Losslesso  AIFFo  WAVThe iPad can view the following document types:o  Images (.jpg, .tiff, .gif);o  Documents (.doc and .docx (Microsoft Word), .txt, .pdf, .rtf);o  Web pages (.htm and .html);o  Keynote (.key);o  Numbers (.numbers);o  Pages (.pages);o  PowerPoint (.ppt and .pptx)o  Outlook Contacts (.vcf);o  Excel (.xls and .xlsx)Re-syncing with iTunesThe iPad 2 will sync up whatever Apps, music, Podcasts, movies, etc., connected/ associated with your iTunes account and currently on your iTunes desktop.  I was able to sync the iPad 2 to iTunes and like magic everything that was on my iPad 1 showed up on my iPad 2, sans the folders I had set up to group Apps in.Transferring My AT&T; 3G AccountAll of the iPad 64GB Wi-Fi/3G devices I have purchased thus far use AT&T; for their 3G service.  There are two plans at the time of this review: $14.99 for 250MB a month data package and $25.00 for 2GB date package.A funny thing happened along the way to transferring my current 3G plan to my new iPad 2: AT&T; killed (deactivated) the removable SIM card in the iPad 1.  They claim they needed to, but I'm not so sure, because it makes no sense to me.  Another (micro) SIM card can be obtained from the nearest AT&T; store for free, though so stores may charge you $15.00, so check around.  Once the new SIM is inserted into the iPad 1 you can set-up and activate the 3G service on the device.Note: unused data package byte (for lack of a better term), cannot be rolled over from month-to-month.  Conversely, if your plan minutes run out during the month AT&T; will not automatically anoint you with more; more minutes can be purchased from the iPad 2, but it is a manual process.  However, the package will be renewed at the end of the 30 days, and continue to renew every 30 days unless stopped.Microsoft ActiveSyncSurprisingly, or maybe not so surprisingly, setting up the iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G to use Microsoft Exchange via Exchange ActiveSync is simple and easy; all told it took less the two minute to start receiving my business e-mail on the device, and there does not seem to be a limit to the number of devices associated with a given ActiveSync account.After I established the connection via ActiveSync I verified inbox functionality by reading, responding to, forwarding, and moving, e-mail.  The iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G even allows you to choose whether or not you want to download your business contacts and calendar; sweet!And once connected I am able to control password usage, minimum and maximum length, age, complexity, and expiration via an Exchange ActiveSync policy.  The policy can also control other aspect of the iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G's including third-party e-mail account creation; Windows SharePoint Services and Windows File Shares access; message size limits; attachment downloading, as well as a host of other security related features and functions.Word to the wise: Exchange ActiveSync policies, limited as they can be configured to disable a number of features on the device including camera, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi.  And yes, utilizing ActiveSync I can even wipe the iPad 64GB Wi-Fi/3G from the Exchange server, and as long as the tablet remains a part of the ActiveSync policy it will continue to wipe every time its powered on unless it is either removed from the policy or the check mark is removed from the radio button instructing ActiveSync to \"Perform a remote wipe to clear mobile device data.\"VPN AccessThe iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G has VPN access and it actually work quite well.  There are three options: L2TP, PPTP, or Cisco IPSEC. Like Exchange ActiveSync the VPN functionality was surprisingly easy to set up and get going, all one needs to know is what information to plug in and away we go!VPN took less than a minute to set up and configure, and once complete I was able to log into my company Intranet and thanks to some (free) Apps I was able to RDP into my workstation from the iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G; again, sweet!  Yes, the lack of makes maneuvering around the desktop somewhat challenging, but I could still get around the desktop and use it.  Note: there are paid versions of the Apps I used that offer crude mouse functionality.Like all of the network components on iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G VPN can be togged on and off at will.First Impressions:Like my personal iPad 1, I really, really, really, like the Apple iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G I have been testing.  Naysayers aside this thing is cool and I am happy to own one and even take it out in public!  I love being able to take my favorite book(s) with me when I am on the go, and I have the ability to stop at a Wi-Fi hotspot and plugging into the Internet in order to read the latest news, get the weather, run an application, etc.But, I really like the fact that I can take the lightweight iPad 64GB Wi-Fi/3G with me everywhere and still gain access to my pre-selected books, magazines, music and images, not to mention a seemingly endless supply of useful applications.  And let's not forget the Internet and business e-mail.Today while was waiting in line (yes I said line) for my dealership to open up so I could get me car serviced, I brook out my iPad 2 and started watch videos on Vevo; now how cool is that?Setting up Wi-Fi is easy enough; the antenna is always on and looking for new connection.  I set up the iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G to use the secure wireless setup at work; I typed in the pass-phrase via the incredibly handy keyboard and surfed the Internet; simple and easy.  Since I bought the iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G I have taken it out frequently to places that offer free Wi-Fi access and in only one instance did I have an issue connecting.  Nice!  And even then I effortlessly switched to 3G and, instance access.ConclusionsLike the iPad 1 before it the iPad 2 is the must have device of the decade, period!  Not a day goes by when I do not use it for something.  I love the portability of the device, the ease of use, the utilitarian nature of the unit, thanks in large part to the plethora of Apps that can be down loaded and utilized for the tablet.Is the iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G ready for the enterprise?  I say yes with a few caveats; chief among them is the inability of the tablet to truly manipulate Microsoft Office Applications without the assistance of the Documents-to-Go application ($9.99).  Second is the inability to truly mirror the iPad screen on a monitor, however with the Apple Digital AV Adapter that can be changed.  Video can be presented onto the screen--via an HDMI connection.  Lastly, is the lack of available USB port(s) or a memory card reader that will accept memory devices and help you keep files organized on-the-go, as well as the ability to truly turn the iPad into a mobile office.  As it stands now any document you want to work with must be e-mailed and then opened.  However, the iPad was never marketed as a laptop, or laptop replacement, so...Not that these problems cannot be overcome, but they are limitation that a laptop and even netbooks do not suffer from.  However, hands down, the Apple iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G is a performance winner, and one heck of an e-book reader! Yes, the entrance fee (799.00) is steep, and enterprise customers will have to think long and hard at the cost, however the iPad now has a certain \"cool\" factor that is hard to escape.  The more large enterprises adapt the iPad and find practical uses for it, the more popular it will become in the hall of corporate America.So far the iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G has more than lived up to my expectations and I have fun testing the limits of its ability to operate effectively in the enterprise and personal environments.", "Date": "March 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Why I returned the iPad2", "Author": "David J. Earls", "ReviewID": "R10XWFZEOEKP4O", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First I'm not an Apple hater. I returned the product for several reasons I felt to be valid:<1.>  It's still too heavy and it's not very ergonomic. This product is not comfortable for me to hold for long periods. I would say I'm of average strength (I can do 10 overhand pull-ups). I didn't purchase it to prop it up on a desk. I can use a laptop for that. The 10\" Android tablets I've held are too heavy too. I think I might be happier with a 7\" tablet.<2.>  A certain social networking app I use on the iPod all the time stinks on the iPad. I don't know why they couldn't come up with something better than: A. Open it iPhone size. B. Stretch it with a nasty 2x zoom that really displays poorly.<3.>  There are a ton of iPhone apps, not so much for the iPad. And the aforementioned problem keeps me from wanting to run iPhone apps on the pad. I don't want to have to fight with jail-breaking the device just to run an app full-screen. There do seem to be plenty of games, but I didn't get it for that.<4.>  It doesn't even include a calculator. Sure you can download a calculator from the app store. With the added bonus of a big iAd in the middle of the screen. I didn't know I was getting a $600 iPad with Special Offers.In short I would not purchase this product without planning to jail-break it. If you do that I hear of all sorts of trouble with upgrades and, of course, no Apple support. The bright spot, the electronics store I purchased from let me return it without even charging me a restocking fee.", "Date": "August 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "Maria Viator", "ReviewID": "R2BN776E5O9M3P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love my Apple ipad 2 2nd generation Tablet.

In some ways call my review biased, call me a hypocrite, but whose ever 100% about anything nowadays? Anything Apple is a great investment. I own a new MacBook Pro, I phone 4, iPod and many more. Which makes Apple products and exceptional buy for their quality devices at a steal of a deal where they have a sale. I just wanted to be up to par with technology getting the ipad 2, just to stay ''I own one '', however there are no true differences in my first generation ipad 3G to my second generation non-3G ipad 2. It doesn't have a quality camera like the iphone 4 and still no flesh player. If you want more freedom and full use on ANY site, buy a different branded tablet for your needs like an android. the only obvious changes are 3G on Verizon's network, cameras and new color  (white), the device still remains weighted in ones hand as well as bit slick. It's honestly not enough changes for one to feel the need to upgrade unless money isn't a factor. Apple's lineup changes yearly , so if don't own one yet or are looking to upgrade still, just hang on few more months for the ipad 3. best buy has a buy back program so you could also trade in and apply the value of your pre-owned to purchase of a newer model with more memory/features. still great battery life like anything  Apple, there is no other electronic brand like them. If you invest in the iPad (1 or 2 ), set aside funds to buy a quality protective casing and screen protector because Apple's ''limited'' warranty in deeds limits you, it is NOT ''insurance'' for accidental damage so you should wisely choose a 3rd party warranty like best buys to replace or repair if water damage, glass shattering or worse occurs. there's a warranty out there for everyone that doesn't want to shell out nearly a grand for replacement ipad plus more if you need one jailbreak.", "Date": "May 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "A life altering addition", "Author": "D.

At the time, I really felt like I was \"biting the bullet.\"  I guess I just didn't think I would totally harness it's capabilities and only use it \"casually\" to write the occasional e-mail and surf the web.  To that end, I was right but as far as iPad generations are concerned, this device hits the sweet spot for what I use the tablet for (surfing the web, typing posts on Amazon, Tweeting and the occasional e-mail).  It's not too powerful for gaming per se but offers a silky smooth performance for business related functionality.  I even find that I don't need a BlueTooth keyboard as typing on it's screen in landscape mode is fast and easy enough.The only disappointment I have is that I paid for the cellular antenna.  I find that I mostly use this device in the home as a quick means of accessing the Internet where a WiFi access point is readily available.  I also take it with me out-of-town and for the most part, most hotels offer free WiFi so the cellular aspect of this device was money wasted.I am EXTREMELY pleased with this device's battery life.  It has been tested and found that the iPad 2 has the longest battery life of ALL the iPad generations up through the iPad 4 or \"iPad with Retina Display!\"  I truly believe this iPad second generation is the \"sweet spot\" in Apple's iPad lineup and that is why the Cupertino company is continuing to offer this device for purchase.  You don't really need the \"retina\" screen or the extra 500mb of memory for business tasks such as surfing the web or writing an e-mail.  This device will work flawlessly for those tasks.I can only express how happy I am that I purchased this tablet.  I will probably upgrade to the next iPad 5th generation, if it offers the robust WiFi AC and comes in an even slimmer, more elegant form factor.  I would recommend that users opt out of getting the cellular model unless they need to use the device in their cars for example.

But if you're considering ordering an ipad from armelectronics2011, THINK AGAIN. When I bought my first ipad 2, the listing was for a brand new still in box product. When I received it, the ipad was NOT in its original box (as I anticipated) and after a couple of months, I started to realize that the ipad 2 that I had purchased from armelectronics2011 was complete CRAP. I'm pretty sure that the screen on the ipad I had bought was actually replaced in a very unprofessional way and in time, it showed because the white ipad began to turn yellow. The home button did not work correctly, the glass began to peel away from the actual ipad, and the entire ipad began to act as if it had a virus (which apple products supposedly do not get viruses). When I contacted the seller about their false advertising for their \"brand new product\" it took two days of phone tag to even contact them, and even when I FINALLY talked to them, they basically told me \"oh well, not our fault, you can pay the return shipping and a restocking fee to get your money back\" -which by the way is not at all worth the trouble after all of their unnecessary fees for something that was THEIR FAULT. I in the end kept the ipad 2 from this seller (REGRETFULLY) and eventually bought a new one.Basically, if you want to splurge for an ipad of any sort, go for it because in my opinion it is worth it. But if you're planning to purchase from this seller, PLEASE don't. Really. Do not get ripped off in the way I did.

I originally thought that it was just an overgrown iPod touch, but the more I learned about it, the more I realized that it seemed to be a small computer. The iPad has Bluetooth capabilities and I bought a Bluetooth keyboard to go with the iPad. I am still wrapping my head around the iPad and all its features. I really enjoy the iCloud, allowing me to sync up my iPhone and iPad. One of the first apps I downloaded was Pages and it has been fantastic. One of my biggest concerns regarding the iPad is the accessibility to remove documents, pictures,etc off of the iPad. There is no USB port, so I cannot hook up a zip-drive and due to the age of my Mac, I cannot download the iCloud app. So my only options are to email it to myself or go on my computer, go to the iCloud website, sign-on and get the document that way. When I brought this up to the Apple worker, he stated that the iPad is capable of printing directly from the iPad as an option as well. So that minimized my concerns. Over all, I am very happy with the decision I made, all my questions regarding the iPad have been able to be answered with a simple google-search.

I am currently a college student with plans to teach at the high school level, so I knew there would be endless amount of apps that will enhance my teaching in the future.  Right now, schools are exploring 1 on 1 iPads with their students because it makes it so much easier to grade and create assignments without the hassle of textbooks.  At home, I became sick of pulling out my four-year old Dell laptop to surf the web, watch videos, and just play around.  I wanted something that was smaller, easy to travel with, and it had to be a tablet.  Now, my Dell is fine for writing papers and all the other obligations that come with being a college student, but for an apple product as efficient and productive as the iPad, the price is tough to beat.  The iPad does not replace a desktop or a laptop, but it is a tremendous technological device that is user friendly and fun to play with.  Whether it is for leisure or work, there is an application for it.  What I like the most is that the ios apple system signals to the iPad when it is time for an update, making it up to par with the latest technology, which in turn betters its efficiency and productivity instantly.  With that being said, the ability to access the apple store is what sets it apart from other tablets.  Like I previously stated, there are apps for everything, and there are even several free apps that increase enjoyment and productivity.  It is a must buy for anyone interested in a tablet for both leisure and work obligations.I also have an iPhone 4 which I use very religiously, and the iPad 2 is an extension of that for me.  There are fewer apps available for the iPad, but that's not saying a lot, as there are still thousands available for it, as I find myself searching for a new app daily on the apple store.I have the 32GB edition and have not come close to filling up all the storage space!  I think it is the perfect size for somebody that doesn't constantly use it, but for someone that is on it daily at work or at home.  If you are going to count on it for everything you do in regards to a computer device, I would recommend the 64GB, but for me the 32GB has been great and I have not run into any problems to this point.  In addition, the device is very light, and you can hold it with one hand.  Definitely buy a protective case for your iPad, even though I have found it to be very durable.It is very nice to be able to use it like a mini computer.  You can access your personal files via google drive, drop box, etc. to increase productivity and bring your desktop or laptop files on the road with you.  One nice feature is that you can view websites with a mobile display or desktop display, serving for the benefit of all users.  Powerpoints, Word Documents, and PDF's are easy to view with the tap of the finger, which is very beneficial for someone in the business world or still in school.While I thoroughly enjoy my iPad 2, there are frustrations with it.  I find myself frustrated with the fact that I can't play Flash.  I like to watch videos, especially via twitter and facebook, and a lot of times I am unable to do so because of the software's inability to play flash.  In addition, I get frustrated because I wish I could make the iPad my only source of a computer.  I wish I could type on word and make a powerpoint as seamless as I do on my Dell.  I could do that, but on a college budget you don't want to be paying for an expensive app to make that a reality, but that's also the beauty of it.  You could download Microsoft Office products if you wanted to make it your go-to computer device.  One thing I would suggest is buying a keyboard for your iPad.  I went a year without one, but once I acquired a keyboard it made it that much more efficient to use!  So much easier to surf the web, iMessage, etc.In essence, if you're having a tough time deciding on buying an iPad or not, I would highly suggest buying one.  Now, if it is between a MAC laptop and an iPad, go with the laptop.  But, if you are in the market for a tablet and are looking for efficiency and productivity with a tablet, the iPad is a much because of the apple IOS software and the thousands of applications available via the apple store.  The slick design with endless amount of possibilities to increase production with an iPad puts it a head above the rest.  Once you begin using an iPad, you won't regret the purchase.", "Date": "March 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wonderfully limited", "Author": "D. Adams", "ReviewID": "R38DNSHOAQXTDT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I swore up and down I'd NEVER purchase an apple product, including things on itunes and the like.  So far, I have upheld that promise.  However, from a recent car purchase, I managed to obtain an iPad 2 16GB as a promotion.  Since my girlfriend had one and I did want some experience with iOS, I figured I'd begin poking around with it rather than simply selling it.The good...iOS is very easy to use and extremely straight forward.  Everything is laid out nicely and always a flick-tap away.  And most all programs work very well with the unit.  Software tends to be clean without too many bugs.Web browsing (just using Safari) is very smooth.  Most sites work well.  There's the ocational hiccup but it's more from using a touchscreen or the dreaded lack of Flash.  But soon enough, sites will probably migrate away from flash and on towards HTML5 (or simply pages designed for mobile/iPads).Usability, such as typing is very straight forward.  The keyboard is well thought out and works much better than any I've used.  The touchscreen is very responsive too and multi-touch works without a problem.Standby time is awesome and the unit is still functioning (IE gives you push notifications of Skype/AIM/etc)Given the standpoint of say someone's who's very unfamiliar with technology or who doesn't care to spend time \"configuring things\", this works great.  However, that is not who I am...The bad...You are extremely limited.  Being closed source, some apps simply are not available as they would be for Android or Windows-based tablets (and I mean x86, not Windows 8 RT)  Finding ways to print can be impossible, certain formats may be unreadable, and even simple things such as adding attachments in gmail may be hindered without installing additional apps.No Flash support!!!  As mentioned above, things are moving away from flash.  However, many sites still use flash there for some sites will not display correctly.  You are also limited on sites like Youtube, sometimes being unable to open the same videos you can open on a desktop environment (or even Android devices).Where are my files?!  Stuff just downloads.  You have no choice where to put them.  Download something you don't want to share then start browsing the photos you took using the camera, SURPRISE!Limited connectivity.  Expansion is limited to the propriatary apple plug on the bottom.  No OTG port, no standard USB, no microSD slot, no HDMI.  You can purchase some overpriced devices to give you these functions, but it would be nice to see some of them included.---All in all, it depends on the person whether or not one of these would fit your bill.  My girlfriend loves hers and almost never uses her PCs anymore.

This was my best purchase of the decade. The parental controls are amazing. I have Safari, iTunes, App Store, etc. all disabled. They have about 13 movies, 64 apps (mostly educational apps for letter tracing, coloring, baby Spanish, and so on), 28 books, and even Netflix for the weekends. They learned how to use it VERY QUICKLY! Within a day of showing them how to do stuff no more than once, they've pretty much mastered it. I have an Otterbox Defender case on it because they do abuse it quite a bit. When watching Netflix I hook it up to the TV so they don't have to worry about holding it. When we do leave the house and are away from WIFI they have plenty of content to keep them happy, esp in the car on long trips.I have an iPhone so I haven't use it for myself yet. If you have PC and are used to Windows 7 you will feel the iPad is extremely limited on what you can do. The onscreen keyboard is very awkward for my small hands when typing because the letters are so spaced out. My WPM drop dramatically on the iPad but pairing it with a Bluetooth keyboard I imagine will fix that problem, except that I've yet to see one that comes close to my Windows Keyboard. However, I just installed Windows 8 on my PC and I hate it so much I am considering selling it and purchasing an iPad for myself.I'm also saving up to get one for my 67 year old daddy whom calls me weekly asking me how to get the sound and video back working on Skype and how to get back to his FB page on his laptop.

They help to define who we are by being a source of connection to the world. An iPad is what has been my connection and has transformed my life exceedingly. It also enhanced every aspect of my life in many unique ways. My iPad 2 is reliable, family/school friendly and has also served as a memory book for me.Apple has been in existence for decades, since 1976, and has grown to become our apple and nutrition of the day providing us iPhones, Macs, iPods and iPads. Apple has become a very trustworthy brand. Before I purchased the iPad on Amazon I needed to confirm that it was going to be worth my time, effort and money. I was blown away by the results of the reviews it had obtained throughout the years. Most of the reviews had given it a five star rating. At that point I knew I needed to buy my iPad 2. I anticipated its arrival anxiously because of the great qualities the product had. In the end, it was everything I had imagined it to be.My brothers fell in love with it as much as I did, or possibly even more. I started exploring my iPad, downloading games and taking pictures. I am amazed at how much one little device can calm and contain children. I have four hyper active brothers and sisters and my iPad has worked miracles on them. They all sit down and as one quietly plays on the iPad, the others patiently wait for their turn. Before my siblings would be jumping and running around everywhere, yelling and fighting about everything. After that point my mom always carried my iPad and she is now buying one for herself. My iPad has become very helpful when it comes to school. I can take notes on it. I complete my homework on it.as type up my essays; watch instructive videos, take educational pictures and much more.  It also converts to a television on weekends. The screen is big enough to watch movies on it, browse Netflix and watch almost anything else. I have grown an emotional connection with my iPad and if you have a family or go to school, I know it will be the perfect product for you as well because it has the capability of helping one though any struggle that may arise.Not only is it an amazing device because of the things it can do but it is also easy to carry around. It is very portable and lightweight compared to carrying a laptop. A laptop does not have the same durability as an iPad. The iPad will hold many memories; it will be like a digital scrapbook that you can easily access and always retain. The iPad memory is what preserves those special moments with your pets, family and anything that is very dear to your heart. The iPad may be purchased with different types of memory according to what it will be used for. Also because it is so transportable it has a great battery capacity, making the life of the iPad longer. Lastly, the iPad's 2 cameras will capture many memorable and wonderful moments. The camera captures clear and vivid images that will last a lifetime.My iPad has been a huge focus in my life. I believe it will be a long lasting item that I will not become bored of or toss in the corner like another abandoned electronic. I will always feel confident in recommending this item and what better place to purchase it than Amazon. Amazon has everything for a better, cheaper price; it is dependable and has the option for fast shipping if needed. My life truly has been blessed by this prodigious electronic. I agree with most people that this item deserves a five star rating. It has been two years since I have bought my iPad and I continue to be a very happy costumer, and will continue to be a consumer of apple products in the future.", "Date": "September 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "iPad is my newest addiction...", "Author": "J.

It came to a cross roads where my husband said if you can prove to me that you need it you can get it... Well need and want are two very different things but I justified the purchase by listing all the functions and daily life the iPad would help with. I got my way and when I got my iPad was thrilled with what I had expected to be a super functioning and helpful tool. I hadn't realized just how wonderful it would be. From movies, music, books, shows, orginization, games and productivity, the iPad has made waves throughout my house. My husband has since admitted the need for more than one iPad in a single household. He is on it almost as much as me! Our 4 year old has found it to be enthralling and has provided a great outlet for learning, and entertainment!  It is easy to use, even for the kiddos and has provided our family with a great helper on long trips. Some of the apps are expensive but that is okay when you are choosy with your needs. Most apps have a free version. I have gotten pretty fast on the keyboard. The iPad connects easily to available wifi and makes using the feature painless. I love my iPad! I reccomend a case immediately! With an investment such as this you can't be too careful. Usually you can find them online or in discount stores. Because the model is the same size as the previous iPad and will likely be the same as the iPad 3 screen protectors need not be outrageously priced. I have had issues finding all the books and magazines I thought there would be, however I expect in short order there will be releases.

I was originally against it and bought the Asus Transformer first. It's not the greatest thing in the world, but the operating system and features are good in their own way. I might one day sell it and buy a Prime, since I like certain things about Android better. The main part that I don't like is the speed it operates at. (Lags a lot). But this is not about Android; it's about the iPad.Ok, so the main reason that I was against the iPad and Apple products was it's use of slave children to make them and the exclusivity of the operating system. Slave children part? Still an issue. But the main reason I ended up buying one was the promise of Apple of making textbooks for college available on them. I had waited so long for it, too. How convenient is that? No more aching back and such. SSOOOOOOOO nice! And the exclusivity of the operating system? It's honestly not as bad as people had made it out to be. For the most part, things work really well in all aspects for the iPad and there's really only a few websites that I have gone to that don't play videos. I don't play flash games, so that's not an issue. But for reals, the iPad has the best apps and they're tailored specifically for it. The best example is Splashtop, which remotely accesses your computer. It certainly is NOT optimized for the Transformer. The greatest thing is that I can actually watch movies streamed from my computer in bed! When it comes to the processing power, I have been told that the components are the same for both of my tablets, but the iPad plays streaming video a whole lot better. And it also does just about everything better.....except for the widgets. Why can't Apple design widgets for the iPad??? That's why I like the operating system of Android better, plus you can customize it better and surf files better and generally get a more user-oriented experience. Once again though, the apps for iPad ARE better and there ARE more of them, (though not a whole lot). It quickly does hit a brick wall and the apps fall dramatically in quality. Most of the apps that are truly useful, you will find on both. Itunes though is a b*tch and I truly do not enjoy using it. This cuts back to the point I made that files are easier to work with on Android products. If you can climb successfully up the iTunes learning curve, you will do well, but you shouldn't enjoy it, if my experience is anything to go on. So, that's about all I have to rant about right now. If you're like me, you'll just blow your money and get an Apple product AND and Android product. Both good, but for now, the iPad is MUCH better. I swear, sometimes I just want to hold it and fall asleep with it. Oh, and just as a quick afterthought, the next generation of iPads need more quick-access buttons, just like Android. There should be a menu button, back button, (that doesn't just take you back to the main screen), and a quick-switch multitasking button. If they did this, the iPad would truly reign supreme.

The screen for movies and tv shows was fantastic though the wifi connection would keep dropping in the middle of streaming. The more I used the Fire the more I realized that it wasn't able to give me what I wanted.  It did not have a large enough amount of device itself storage space,I could not turn the backlight down low enough to make it comfortable for me to read, I could not download the BN reading app to read my BN book library, and the screen really wasn't large enough to comfortably browse the internet or read magazines.  I started looking at the Ipad 2 and after what I saw from a co-worker's IPAD I gifted my Fire to my sister and bought my own Ipad.  I absolutely love it!  It has given me everything that I wanted - most specifically the fact that I can have the Amazon reading apps and BN reading app on the device and can read both bookstore's library on the same device.  I had purchased the 16 mb but two days later upgraded to the 64 mb.  The backlight can be turned down to being almost off, browsing is great, reading my emails is easier now. The wifi connection is solid up in my room where the Fire would keep dropping the connection. I am amazed at how much you can do with this device with the different apps.  It is always with me!  True it is heavier than the Fire - it's more like reading a hardback book, but the print is big and the backlight is softer on the eyes.  Also true is the fact that I now cannot watch the Amazon Prime movies and tv shows, but ITunes has a lot to offer even though you have to pay for it.  Small trade-off in my opinion since I am mostly a book person - not a movie person.  Now if Amazon were to make a bigger Fire and take care of some of the issues I mentioned above - the Fire could definitely give the IPAD a run especially having the Instant Prime Video behind them but for now I would recommend the IPAD 2 over the Kindle Fire.  p.s.

Then Apple sold 15 million of them in just nine months, creating a whole new category of technology product. The iPad may have become, in the words of Steve Jobs, \"the most successful consumer product ever launched.\"It turns out that a lot of people saw the iPad's appeal: it's a supremely portable device that's well suited for checking your e-mail, surfing the Web, playing games, reading books and other stuff you get off the Internet, and even for getting work done. Kids and the elderly have embraced it.It's awfully hard to follow such a massive success, but that's the task set out for Apple's new iPad 2, which goes on sale Friday. At least the iPad 2 has this going for it: the original model caught the technology industry so flat-footed that only now are true competitors beginning to appear.Those competitors will now face a new iteration of the iPad, one that's faster, smaller, and lighter than the model introduced a year ago--all while retaining the $499 entry price that has proven all but impossible for Apple's competitors to match. It's almost unfair.A game of inches (and ounces)Call it Jobs's Law if you like: The latest version of any Apple product is likely to be thinner and lighter than its predecessor. And so it is with the iPad 2. The size difference between the original iPad and the iPad 2 may seem slight, but that's only because we're dealing with such small products to begin with. But for products this small, every ounce and fraction of an inch counts.The iPad 2 measures 7.31 by 9.5 by 0.34 inches, and weighs in at 1.33 pounds (in the case of the Wi-Fi-only version, that is--the AT&T; and Verizon 3G versions are .01 and .02 pound heavier). That means Apple shaved .17 pound off the Wi-Fi version and .26 to .27 pound off the 3G version. The iPad 2 is also .16 inch narrower, .06 inch shorter, and .16 inch thinner than the original iPad.A matter of small degrees, to be sure, until you consider the percentage change: the iPad 2 is roughly two-thirds the thickness of the original iPad, and 88 percent of its weight (83 percent when comparing 3G models). Pick up an iPad 2 after handling an original iPad, and you'll notice the difference right away.

Seemless. If you had the first one and moved to the 2nd one, it's worth the move. I made a back up of the original and after going through iTunes everything just moved right over. Made a few tweeks here and there but otherwise it was painless.As far as the size goes, it's definently lighter than the first one and it's really lighter than the XOOM, which I had a chance to play around with on Saturday. Also due to the size, it feels like it swims around in the original's case so you definently will want a new one. With the new case, Apple really wants you to show off the sleekness of the device which is cool, but you want to take advantage of having AppleCare in case you accidentally drop it and it breaks. When things get smaller and slimmer, it always tends to feel more fragile. My complaint about the exposure is the back of the iPad which I can see being scuffed in a few weeks so I may get something to protect the back of it. Otherwise, this truly looks like a slate.It does feel speedier when loading up apps and as far as gaming goes, some like Infinity Blade and Shadow Guardian really gets a boost from the extra speed. They look much better and the loss of framerate is not as noticable as the iPad 1's.There is however still a bit of barely noticable stutter in some movies shown via Netflix when streaming which makes me hope that the next gen iPad has the Retina Display or something better for true on the go HD viewing.The cameras, while not the best ( I still don't see someone trying to do serious photography with this so this is not a big deal for me) still does very great with Face Time support. I demoed it a few times with one of my friends who also had the ipad 2 (as well as the iPhone 4) and people who has never seen Face Time in action were astounded. This was the video phone that we only imagined back in the 60s and 70s.There is still no SD Slot, no Thunderbolt support however the battery still holds a charge ( I just charged mine for the first time last night) and the screen is more bright and crisp than that of the XOOM.Apple has done a good job at taking the next step with the iPad and any competitor that had something coming out this year really need to take notes because if they don't move swiftly enough, Apple will dominate the tablet space in a similar fashion as they did the mp3 space with the iPod.If you had the first one ther are a few small surprises that you are in for, if this is your first one, you will be amazed about what you have missed out on.", "Date": "March 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Bad IOS 7", "Author": "Hong", "ReviewID": "R2O5VO42TUI06K", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My IPAD2 was good when I used IOS6.

I've dropped my iPad 2 on the same floor maybe 2x. It got a tiny dent in the aluminum frame. I have dropped this iPad on wood floors, ceramic tile, stone tile, concrete, asphalt, you name it (yes, grass, too). I do not, nor have I ever, had a case on it. Sure, the edges of the case are dented beyond repair, but the screen and (surprisingly) the back of the frame are scuff-free.BUT!!! However you drop it, DO NOT drop anything on it! My TV remote slipped from my hand less than 1 foot above my screen, and it obliterated the home button, which I now keep in my pocket. I found it extremely ironic :)The screen is impossible to scratch, however. Not gouge, but scratch. Since it's broken, I ordered a new screen. I decided to see how tough the screens are by scratching one with a nail (as in hammer and nail, not finger nail). It could not scratch it. Since I don't remember much of the Mohs Hardness scale, and I lack a diamond, it's somewhere between a 3 and 10 hardness.- Personalization .1/5Apple has too much restricted customer customization of this product. As soon as you get this product, JAILBREAK IT! Jailbreaks are not illegal unless you install illegal sources. If you don't like any aspect of Apple's software designs, from there being a six-icon limit on the dock, to being able to run all your applications in windows or have Siri on the iPad, Jailbreak it. 99.9382% of the time you'll find the tweak you're looking for.- Size 2.3/5Frankly, 2 years ago when I was 13 I was flipping out to get such a big electronic toy. Now I think it's too freaking big. If you want a size that is good for presentations, yet still retaining good mobility, go with an iPad. If you want something you can stick in you're jacket pocket yet still be able to read, get something nearby the size of a Kindle Fire, even though I personally think iPad is 700x better.- Battery Life 5/5...I sometimes sit there and watch the battery drain, because I'm afraid if I open an app it will die (obviously this is at maybe 5-30% battery life). Yet sometimes I've found I can play for 4-5 hours, on a 3D game, no less, from 100% to dead.- Display ...The part we've all been waiting for...Honestly, I'd have to say... 4.6/5I thought the display was absolutely stunning. That is, until I saw the iPad 3. I started seeing minor (MINOR!!!!!!) flaws on edges. This was mostly in a few particular apps designed for both iPhone and iPad, most of the other apps were just fine.If you don't mind not having 3,100,000 pixels, take 786,432 pixels instead. You won't notice a difference, so long as you avoid iPad 3's.- Versatility 5/5I use this for school, homework, games, browsing the web to buy a new screen, FaceTiming with friends, staying up-to-date with friends, you name it.

The iPad's various styli, with their resistant, rubbery \"nubs,\" still leave much to be desired).  Yet, overall there would appear to be few if any viable alternatives at this stage.  Apple was first to the parade and, according to practically every review of the latest model (including that most popular consumer's magazine), continues to remain in the top position.The primary advantage of the Apple 2--from my perspective--would appear to be the lighter weight and more compact size.  Personally, I found the iPad 1 to be hot and heavy compared to my Air 11\", which I now use for practically all of my computing.  So be sure to take note of screen size and overall weight of any other device you may be considering before ordering.  Also, note that the highest-rated tablet on Amazon (the Toshiba) has yet to be released!  If you're considering it, it would seem overly hasty if not reckless not to wait for it to \"test out\" on the market for a few months.As for the iPad, the Flash controversy proved a non-issue for my wife and me.  The lack of certain ports--for HDMI, USB, display, etc.--was never anything that couldn't be addressed and fixed with a readily available adapter.  Finally, look for any other machine that comes close to the iPad in terms of the galaxy of available \"apps.\"  The lack of a keyboard (true of most any tablet) can also be addressed--but now we're getting close to a Macbook Air, which strikes me as the more practical purchase in the first place.In short, there's every reason to spring for another iPad (if you like the concept in the first place) and a number of reasons to withhold purchase of any other brand.  But a caveat: this is one of the few times that I've found a product sold through Amazon to be significantly higher in cost, even without sales tax, than the same product purchased through Apple Store.[As a musician, I've found a reason to like this device: it can be loaded up with musical scores (several life-times' worth) and set on a stand or piano ledger, the equivalent of a giant-sized cabinet full of notated music contained within a thin, easily readable and navigable tablet.]", "Date": "June 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "The only mature tablet available", "Author": "M.

As for stability IOS (Apple) is miles ahead of Google.- Tons of tablet optimized applications, I have around 20 that I use regularly and never had a problem with any of them.- Zinio iPad application, if you are a Zinio subscriber the iPad is the best way to read your magazines. Much much faster than using even a desktop and also much more pleasant to read and use.- Can play pretty much any kind of video (including avi, mkv and others)if you install AVPlayerHD and output via HDMI. No stutter like on current batch of honeycomb tablets, at least in 720p which I use...- Great keyboard (virtual).- Battery we get around 11 hours on a charge with wifi on.- Stanby is even better you can most likely leave the tab unplugged and come back a week later to use it. If android phones are anything to go by android tablets probably don't have anywhere near the same standby performance. (can't remember the number of times I forget to plug my android phone at night and wake up with it dead, while my wife never plugs her iPhone and )Could have been better:- Flash support would have been good but I can live without it and quite frankly I just wish flash would go away from the web. Its not secure, is a resource hog and basically not very good technology in my opinion.- An sd card slot for expanding memory or keeping your music/movie collection on. So far I did not see a need for this but could be something I miss in the future.I don't like (in general for all Apple IOS devices):- Can only sync to one computer and the iTunes on that computer. What if you have more than one computer ? or quite simply want to load something at work and you are synced with a computer at home ?

A categorical comparison quickly reveals that the quick release and updates were unnecessary in such a short amount of time. For new buyers, by all means get the iPad 2 and the updated features. However, for those owners of an original iPad, do not waste $500 buying this \"new and improved\" product, because the $600 original you are holding in your hands right now is essentially the same.For starters, the dimensions for both products are the same, with the exception of the width. The iPad 2 is 0.16 inches thinner than the original, resulting in a 0.15-pound decrease in weight. Both devices have the same amount of storage, however the iPad 2 has double the amount of RAM memory performance, which leads to faster download times and less of the \"checkerboard effect.\"  Both devices include models with Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi + 3G and Bluetooth capabilities. The displays are the same size and both feature the fingerprint resistant oleophobic coating. The processor on the iPad 2 features the Dual-Core A5 chip, whereas the original only has the A5 chip, but upon consistent use, the speed appears to be about the same. The original iPad uses the Mac iOS 4.2.1 operating system, which is just a step down from the iPad 2's iOS 4.3 operating system, and few differences are noted, and nearly none are experienced.The one feature that Apple is heavily marketing is the user's ability to FaceTime another iPad 2 user. Although this is cool, is it really worth spending an extra $500 if you already own an iPad? Why not just use your iPhone? Or Skype? Apple is also talking up the iPad 2's 10-hour battery life. They must be hoping no one does their research, because the original iPad has the exact same battery life! The iPad 2 also features a new, smart cover. What's really \"smart\" about an electronic device cover, I'm not entirely sure. I own an original iPad black leather cover and I think it's pretty smart too.If you are reading this review and do not own an iPad at all, by all means go for the new iPad 2. It's fast, skinny and features a camera and FaceTime abilities. However, if you already are the proud owner of an original iPad, do not waste your money. If it only took Apple one measly year to release an iPad 2, it probably won't take much longer to release an iPad 3 or 4. By that time, maybe the updates will actually be worth burning a hole in your wallet. For now, my suggestion is save your money, cherish your original iPad, and wait until an \"upgraded\" product comes along that actually presents some significant improvements.", "Date": "April 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "A new way of computing", "Author": "BobinmidMO", "ReviewID": "R2AEG670Y3HN9Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As a geek for friends and family I have already taken delivery of my IPad 2 32GB WI-FI + 3G with AT&T; even though they're still in short supply because of all the sadness that's hit Japan, even though 4 week delivery times are being promised, don't expect it this fast.

Our head guy here at Amazon said in his interview here that we'll see over 40 tablet style computers on the market by this coming Christmas and now I understand why.  The simple fact is much of our time on line is spent simply reading stuff.  Then why carry around a keyboard we're not using?  Be it via Wi-FI or 3G, the upload speeds are simply astounding so we can read or watch videos at speeds that will astound even jaded users such as myself.  Don't look at an IPad 2 as a new computer.

About 2 weeks ago I had a heart attack and my Dr. Told me that I need to have a 1000 cal diet and work out a lot more.  Well I couldn't use my phone for the calory counting, too small.  Well I decided to buy iPad 2 and I was angry, but I knew I needed one for ONE reason is to count calories.  I've had it for about a week now, and I LOVE IT.  I really can't leave with ought it anymore. iPad 2 really is saving my life, with the apps to count my cal, my workout programs, and even my Dr. Can see what I eat and what I do at the gym.  I'm not going to talk about how cool it is to serf the web, and do business on it...  I have a 16 g white iPad.

Why they couldn't use the camera from the current iPhone, which is quite good, on this $500+ product, is beyond me. It is a huge flaw in an otherwise mostly outstanding beast.  On a more minor note, the Apple tendency to design for profit instead of ease of use is always maddening. Case in point:  The built in memory costs $100 for each additional 16GBs.  My (non-iPhone) phone has a removable mini SD card that cost $9 for 16 GB, and I can add memory at will, for very little money. This could easily have been the Apple approach with the iPhone & iPad. A mini SD is the size of a fingernail. So I still buy Apple products because they are so good in so many ways, but the affordability thing is kind of ridiculous. Their computers are better than PCs, no question, but should not cost fully twice to three times what a comparable PC costs.", "Date": "April 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "No Java!", "Author": "amikeliunas", "ReviewID": "R3E2COPAC0ZI3I", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Most people are aware that iPads don't run Flash based content.IPad has its own YouTube browser to compensate for this design flaw.However, no one mentions that you can't run Java on an iPad or iPhone!!!There are still thousand of web sites and corporate applications running Java.Java is still #1 or #2 language in the world for developing applications.Because Apple had an internal war with Adobe and Sun, the consumers suffer and received a product that has a limited feature set.Check with this url [...]Steve Jobs has been quoted as saying \"Java's not worth building in.

My mistake as I should have known they used Flash. Im just glad I didnt buy a 3G model or I really would have tossed more cash in the fire. I should have done better research, but figured there would be some sort of workaround, but there is not as of now. I would have been much better off with another of the competitors that used flash.Also there is very limited expandability. This is more of a gadget and not a computer or even a netbook. At least I can get on websites and use it with a netbook.It will allow me to stay connected through emails and some do some slow surfing, but thats really the extent of it.This is a very sad disappointment for business use....", "Date": "July 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Ok", "Author": "Matilde Lopez", "ReviewID": "R26Q1K1KGACKNX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Perfect.I Love de iPad, is great and my mom love itI like and i think it is wonderfull", "Date": "June 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love it !!", "Author": "Maureen Miller", "ReviewID": "R2SOF8R7E8H3O2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this for my 7 year old granddaughter.

I don't want the person who gave it to me to find out about the loss.  Also, I cannot afford a new one from Apple.  I chose the vendor Sikksound because of the positive reviews.  I am conditionally pleased with my choice.  The iPad I received was in pristine condition, with an Apple box, charging cord and fast charge plug.  It also came with a textured protective backing.  I discovered that the iPad had been used in Italy because of the formatting and information I found in the settings.  After a series of very courteous and helpful e-mail conversations with Sikksound, I was able to resolve the formatting issues.However, I warn purchasers of used AT&T; iPads of an expensive and cumbersome complication.  AT&T; uses a SIM card to enable cellular data usage.  When sold by Apple, a new AT&T; iPad comes with a SIM card which allows for periodic data usage.  In other words, a cellular data plan may be purchased through the iPad for a month, and then cancelled.  When cellular data is needed again, one can simply by more data for that month, and so on.  Because of it's Italian heritage the iPad I received was equipped with a SIM card incompatible with AT&T; in the U.S.  In order for the iPad to use cellular data, a new AT&T; SIM card was required.  A local AT&T; store installed one without alerting me to the $36 fee, and without explaining that the monthly data plan must be ongoing, or the SIM card is deactivated.  A replacement SIM card from AT&T; is not renewable, like the one which comes in a new iPad from Apple.  The AT&T; store rep deactivated the SIM card within a few minutes after explaining that the data plan must be ongoing.  I only discovered the $36 charge when my bill arrived.  Luckily AT&T; removed it because I had not used any data.I rarely use cellular data because wi-if is so accessible.

He has been very proficient at using ipad from a very early age. itunes store has a huge selection of learning apps for his age group and younger. My son has been a ipad and ipod user sinc he was about 9 months old, he thinks he is playing, but he is really learning. He is way ahead of where he should be and he has had a ton of fun doing it. After ios 6&7 came out his ipad 1  was no longer able to keep up with the technology of the upgraded apps. I purchased the 64g ipad 2 so he would have plenty of room for his apps since some of the apps can be large downloads. i am able to also to limit what he is able to do in settings and the app store. He can only get apps ifi unlock it. ipad 2 was easy to child lock certain features and content. ipad 2's long battery is great on trips, it keeps him busy and i dont need active wifi for his apps to work. I wish that ipad existed with my other children. I like that he is learning on current to future technology that most daycares or preschools can not provide.  I recommend this to any parent. The ecpense is worth it. A childs education id priceless. ipad 2 is perfect for facilitating that.TJ", "Date": "October 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's a Great Buy", "Author": "Marty D", "ReviewID": "RC7QU27HCFR82", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this model because I just wanted a basic Wi-Fi unit to surf the web from home and retrieve my emails.

I'm not recommending to get rid of your laptop and get an iPad because there are certain things I can not  do on my iPad that only my laptop can do the job, but you should definately get one for its portability, accessibility and great battery life.  I was so impressed with my Ipad I went out and purchased an ipad mini this was in a 3 month period. Also plan to upgrade my regular ipad for the new edision with 120gs and my laptop with an Mac Air.

It was given to me as a gift. I use android based phones.My impression is that the ipad is very much like the iphone. Exactly the way you get into the phone you do the ipad. The icons are identical. So if you're coming from those other devices it's nice to have the same icons that you're already familiar with.Overall I'm happy with the unit. My only real complaints are the camera, speakers, no siri and lack of microsd card slot. The camera is horrible. I was shocked to learn the mexapixel that comes stock on this device. I don't think it's even 1 megapixel but for taking pictures it's really bad. Very grainy. Video recording is in hd so when the video does come out the picture is good quality. But the camera pictures are horrible.The speakers are mono. I'm not sure why they are mono on such a flagship device. They sound ok but i figured you would at least get stereo speakers with something that costs over $400.Lack of microsd slot. Now this is really bad. iphones dont have them either. neither do their ipods. it's a great way for apple to make more money since you can't upgrade the storage capacity. Android tablets and phones I'm able to add up to 64gb of extra storage. So with this device I'm locked in to what storage I buy. That's apple's deal so take it or leave it.No siri. Upgrading to os 6 I thought that I would at least get siri. No. Apple won't allow that. Kinda sad for their once top of the line tablet. Ok but not really a big deal. Just would have been a nice feature.If I were in the market for a new tablet now, I would seriously consider the Samsung Note 10.1.

I can use it almost continuously for approximately twenty hours before I need to reuse it. Less if I'm using heavy graphics, etc. But even then it functions for around sixteen hours. It charges very quickly when turned off and plugged into the wall. The screen is very responsive, and the keyboard is not as difficult to use as I had feared (this is referring to the larger keyboard that appears when you turn the device side-ways. The smaller keyboard is more difficult, but not impossible). The only downside I see to the keyboard is that I can't select Spanish letters and accents.

Like most people, I use the iPad 90% of the time on just a few Apps. For me, reading an ebook, checking stock quotes, and reading the news constitute most of what I do. It's good to have half a million Apps, but it's impossible to use that many, or even a fraction of that. I've compared the iPad to the Kindle for reading ebooks. For me, the iPad is the clear winner. In my opinion, the iPad is easier to read and is sharper, also the color is a plus. The Kindle is hard to read in low light. Maybe if you are outside, the Kindle would have the edge, but I never read outside, and I think most people don't (possibly some do at the beach). I have an iPad 1 with WiFi and 3G, and an iPad 2 with WiFi only. I think the WiFi is the way to go because of the cost savings. Sometimes the 3G is nice, but I don't use it that often.

Nevertheless, the release of the New iPad brings forth a new question: Should you buy the now cheaper iPad 2?There are many factors to be considered when making this purchase. The main upgrades of the New iPad include retina display, faster processor, better cameras, and with iOS 6, siri. My family owns both the iPad 2 and the New iPad. Apple did not change the iPad much between these two generations. It kept the same battery life, the same thickness (almost), and the same design. Thus, it is a personal decision.The devices are very similar, and most of the cons of the iPad 2 are fixed in the New iPad. However, is the upgrade worth $100-150?Cons of iPad 2 and how the New iPad uses them:Lack of Retina Display: When the iPad 2 was released, retina display had already been seen in other apple devices, like the iPod touch 4th generation. The general public was disappointed by the lack of this feature in the iPad 2. The iPad 3 had this feature. However, I don't really notice the difference. They both appear to have excellent displays. The New iPad's improved display can only be identified in rare conditions, such as viewing upgraded apps or sharp photos. Overall, the retina display in the iPad increases the memory many apps in the app store take up. For example, many iPad 2 users posted bad reviews about Monopoly HD when they had an update that increased the memory that app took up extensively. The update of Monopoly HD did not bring any new features besides Retina display. iPad 2 users were angry because now they lost memory without any benefits.Lack of better Cameras: The iPad 2's cameras are terrible. They back facing camera is .7 megapixels. On a smaller screen this would be acceptable because it is still HD, but on a 10 in. screen photos shot by the iPad camera look pixelated. The New iPad is said to have 5 megapixel cameras. Even so, the cameras on the New iPad aren't that great. Look at the video I posted so you can see the difference yourself. The video is best viewed in full screen.Faster Processor: The iPad 2 has a decent processor and is capable of doing everything you can currently do on an iPad decently. The iPad 3 is faster, especially when loading apps. The upgrade is great but not necessary.Siri: With iOS 6, the New iPad will have exclusive new abilities like Siri. Although many are not appreciative of siri after seeing it on the iPhone, the fact that the New iPad will now have it suggests that apple will continue to do this. Apple's newest products will continue to receive features that older products won't have through updates. Thus, it may be a good idea to purchase the New iPad as another one is not expected soon.", "Date": "July 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "iPad is like no other tablet on the market!", "Author": "Granna", "ReviewID": "R1O8TKOWQEI5E1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Apple's reputation for quality is unsurpassed in thier tablet.

With apps like Documents To Go Premium and AVPlayerHD, it has almost completely replaced my laptop, and with the keyboard/case combo I ordered it does word processing just fine. It does pretty well with the battery life at mid-level brightness and does terrific on the lowest setting. Im a college student and Im at school for 12 hours on some days, so time is factor and it delievers.My one big issue with the iPad is its restrictions. You can not drag and drop items like word documents, images, pdf's, videos to and from the ipad without itunes, and because the iPad natively only plays a few video formats, you have to download an app if you want a broader selection. AVPlayerHD plays all video formats and actually allows you to drag these files into the sharing option in itunes. Which makes the device feel much more diverse, but the app isnt free, its about 1.99 in the appstore. Aside from the restriction issue I really like it, it hasnt completely replaced laptop, not until your able to transfer items without the use of iTunes.(There are apps like AVPlayerHD that allow you to transfer  certain incompatible files to your ipad through iTunes, and Im sure there are some for photos and documents, but you'll have to hunt for them down and they probably wont be free -but I guess if you can afford to shell out the dough for an iPad you can afford a couple 1 to 10 dollar apps-)I reccomend the iPad, its pretty cool.*Update*I got my iPad on Jan 14th, 2012 and got rid of it February 12th, 2012. It was very fun for awhile, but once the novelty wore off the iPad was just too limited. I needed more freedom and less hassle, I'm not a fan of going through iTunes for virtually all data transferring. I cant hook anything up to it without some ridiculous peripheral; something as simple as an SD or MicroSD card slot could have made a world of difference, my model was 16 gig. After the iOS 5 update it was down to about 13, and I had over 6 gigs for music and 8 for previous iPod touch apps.I had tons of movies but with the limited none expandable space, I could only fit about three compressed movies at a time, which were greatly smaller in size compared to anything offered in the iTunes store. I greatly regret not going with the Galaxy Tab, which in terms of flexibility is incredibly superior, however, neither of these are computers so the overall flexibility I prefer might never be on that level. That said, I probably should have gone with the Galaxy, although, the iPad was very fun, it wasn't for me.", "Date": "January 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice, easy to use, and a great invention", "Author": "Patricia Brouillette", "ReviewID": "R24VXE1RTD9ESC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is definitely worth the money.

I couldn't justify purchasing it for the longest time because I couldn't figure out how to work it into my technology regime. It's not computer enough to replace my Macbook Pro, and it's not phone enough to replace my iPhone 4 (not the 4S) running 5.0.1. When you factor in the price, I just couldn't convince myself that the iPad was something I couldn't live without.Then the iPad 2 comes out: front- and rear-facing cameras were new, so I could use the iPad for face-timing my mom 14 hours away, but it was essentially still something halfway between a computer and an iPhone.Finally I came to a point where I could spare the $600+ dollars to purchase the cheapest iPad 2 capable of connecting to at&t;'s 3G wireless service. I ordered this iPad on January 18 and just received it yesterday, so keep in mind I've only had this thing for one day.Immediately, I can see how the iPad 2 may come off as seductive; essentially, it's a ginormous screen surrounded by a thin frame of black or white (depends on which color your purchase--I bought white) with a single button. There's no denying that it's sexy. When you turn it on (after plugging it into iTunes and completing the necessary setup) you're blown away by the crisp screen--though it's not yet on par with the Retina display of the iPhone 4 and 4S, it's a luscious screen and only the seasoned 'techie' would notice this slight inferiority. The iPad 2's screen is still better than most if not all its competition.Apple also has a leg-up on its competition with the easy integration with iTunes. If your like me and you bought the iPad 2 to simply be what it is: an iPad, somewhere in between a computer and an iPhone--then you likely won't be filling your iPad 2's limited storage with your entire music library. I opted to sync with only my recently played music, top played music, recently added music, and a few recent playlist I've made, which I'll probably replace with newer playlists as they're made. I did sync with a fair amount of the same apps that I have on my iPhone, a handful of movies, none of my ringtones (what would I use them for?) and ended up using about 9GB of the 16GB available on the iPad 2 model I purchased. And in all actuality, after the firmware files and other junk Apple puts on their products, only about 13-14GB of the 16 are available to use out of the box.As expected, web browsing and email are where the iPad 2 shines. It's very smooth, the screen shows side-screens and sub-menus simultaneously, which really makes this thing quick to use. I used a Best Buy gift card I received for Christmas to purchase Apple's aluminum wireless keyboard to connect to my iPad 2 via Bluetooth and, although the keyboard makes me occasionally reach over for a mouse (you must still use the touch-screen mechanism despite having an actual keyboard), typing is a DREAM on here now! Facebook is also very fun to use with the keyboard setup versus the onscreen keyboard or even using the Facebook app on my iPhone. Don't get me wrong, the onscreen keyboard of the iPad 2 is very usable, but I find with a screen as large as the iPad 2's, I'd prefer having an actual keyboard so as to utilize as much of the screen as possible for web browsing, emailing, Facebooking, and anything else.I wish Apple would make it more clear that for at&t; 3G models, the SIM card is not included and will need to be purchased separately. I haven't gotten around to going to my local at&t; store to pick one up, so I'm not too sure how much a SIM card will cost.All things considered, so far I'd say I'm happy that I purchased the iPad 2. It's only receiving 4 of the 5 stars because, although I'm very comfortable with using it and definitely see myself using it on a daily basis, it hasn't replaced any of my other electronics. In all actuality, it's become another separate electronic device that I've incorporated into my routine for its own purposes. The 4 of 5 stars also reflects the price; I understand that you 'get what you pay for' (which is definitely the case for the iPad 2, as it outperforms the competition on every aspect except price), but for a product to ADD to your routine rather than to REPLACE or SIMPLIFY, I think the price could come down just slightly.

It's only receiving 4 of the 5 stars because, although I'm very comfortable with using it and definitely see myself using it on a daily basis, it hasn't replaced any of my other electronics. In all actuality, it's become another separate electronic device that I've incorporated into my routine for its own purposes. The 4 of 5 stars also reflects the price; I understand that you 'get what you pay for' (which is definitely the case for the iPad 2, as it outperforms the competition on every aspect except price), but for a product to ADD to your routine rather than to REPLACE or SIMPLIFY, I think the price could come down just slightly.

BUY A Keyboard! Mac Bluetooth.Then it was the infatuation with \"apps!\" \" GOLLY look at this! It allows me to print a document!!\"  And other absurdities like that.You know? The stuff that we all have been doing well now for 10 plus years, with the buggy nightmares of the 90s, that used to make one pull hair out in Windows' frustration, now thankfully long suppressed... .I used to refer to Mac devotees as \"Mac Bigots!\"But after dealing with Windows security issues, and instability through every Windows generation... I finally took the plunge with a Powerbook and never looked back. If I became less than a \"Mac Bigot,\" still I learned to love Apple's integration,  stability, sleek looks and creative tides... that happily washed over Apple's countrymen and America as a whole, like that great wave from the first iPhone.But, this is an iPad review and although I don't desire to denigrate this generally great piece of technology or even review it seriously, I  do want to you to seriously consider a Macbook Air before the iPad.Weight is a great part of the allure of the lightweight iPad...but... the new Macbook Air is only about twice as heavy and since it may be likely that the first thing you may buy is a Bluetooth keyboard... that may not be a deciding issue...because if you wish for your, oh so cool... purchase to actually be a functional input device of text... and you took touch-typing in high school... the plunking at an iPhone or iPad's screen... with one's THUMBS... or the dull end of your fingers... becomes a tedious devolution of functionality.And this is the real core of my criticism of PADS in general. They are at this point clever receivers of information but clunky input...ers. One looks for app after app to do the simplest things...  and then we say... \"golly isn't that cool,  I can actually highlight text!\"And guess what? That highlighting of text usually takes a few tries to get the text that you actually need to select with \"TAPS\" selected...to 'mark-up' a doc properly... and some compromise is usually entailed and could have been far more exactly... achieved with a mouse 30 seconds ago.Look ... do I like my iPad?Yes!And I did  order a stylus for 27 bucks and it has not come yet so I can't comment upon that helpful addition as a partial solution for... the iPad's entry flaws... .  But realize... when one peals away the COOL... and gets to the functional daily needs of email ... and entry of certain data... you will spend a good deal of your iPad time... which after all... is life time... learning to get around.. the touch screen and the operating system\"s... limitations.Now ... it is true that if one has say...an iMac which I Highly recommend ... that the real question is: how much...do you actually  need to input at the coffee shop or as a quick reference in the car or as a very light travel basic communication computing device? If the answer is \"not really that much...\" or if putting up with the iPad's limitations for real text entry is OK on occasion... and the added weight of a keyboard is only needed part time... then it has indeed a LOT of very cool qualities and... apps too... that we actually do find we desired and... didn't even know it!!Are even... useful and yes... fun,  a LOT of fun.If you work seriously on the road... an iPad is not for you... at this time in its development... if you need a very cool slick device that is indeed just about the perfect weight and size for extreme portability happiness... and mainly want it for consumption, of information... then the iPad is wonderful.The iPad is a very creative and evolving technology. The \"Cloud\" Apple's and say Dropbox... are bringing all of these devices together and we all are literally with our use... defining their place and potential and the APP ecosystem is indeed VITAL... .That participation in change... is in itself fun to watch and to take part in... lets face it... our participation in that creative process by supporting what works is... a central part of an iPad's attractions... nothing wrong with that! That is the old America, remember her?Creativity  is sadly... so purposefully dimmed for political outcomes... in our dear country...that any tree of creative life left...is worth supporting even one without a real keyboard... .", "Date": "January 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "iPAD 2  Very good", "Author": "Duck", "ReviewID": "R3S885EB8V4OT3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Works well.

With all other tablets, I noticed that the tablet would not react to the touch every once in a while.2. The tablet is for my wife. iOS is much more intuitive than Android when it comes to tablets. the complexity of use of Android is fine for techies, though.3. Assurance of OS upgrade. I know that my iPad 2 would be compatible with future versions of iOS and that Apple would allow free upgrades. At the time of my purchase, I wasn't so sure about Android based tablets (looking at how many Android based cellphones dont get timely OS upgrades)4. Flaws in other tablets. Every other tablet has flaws, which is pretty disappointing. Xoom is good, but they dont deliver what they promise (Read up on Xoom users' agony over the micro SD unusability for over 6 months). Sony tablet doesn't come with 3G.Reasons why I took so long before buying the iPad:1. Dependence on iTunes2. No SD input3.

My girlfriend just got me one for our anniversary. Funny thing is she just got one from her mom for Christmas at my suggestion. So now we both have one.She just recently got wifi at work, too. She takes hers to work. She tends to call me about 3-4 times a day (at least it feels like that) and now she can call me on her iPad using Facetime, so she can see me as well. I don't really know how I feel about that feature sometimes, but it's pretty cool. I have other friends with iPads and iPhones and stuff, so we can all Facetime just like a house phone. It takes a little more effort to use it (just like Skype), but it's a really cool native app to the iPad. The camera quality is a bit to be desired. I think my Mac has a better camera than the iPad.Anyway, I'm not giving a review of Facetime. The iPad 2 is fast. The screen is pretty large compared to my iPod touch and my Droid X. It works well as a reader. The games work well on it. I've even used it as a drawing tablet a few times. I would link a photo I've drawn in my review, but I'm not sure I can do that.The browser works just as well as it does on my Mac and my iPod touch. It's not the best thing in the world, but it works well.Mail is still a problem for me. I can't get my Yahoo to work and I can't actually divulge why. I know the reason why and I'm not willing to fix it because it could be a slight security risk. Gmail works fine for me. I can't get my work e-mail to work either, but I haven't messed with it enough to really determine the reason just yet.The iPads are great to have around to watch Netflix and things like that. Especially when there is a toddler that wants to watch something and everyone else is watching something on the big screen.Finally, the iPads are very expensive. So far my experience with Apple in the past few years is that they build a quality product and it tends to be worth it. I hope they continue this trend. I can't say whether or not it was worth the cost as I didn't shell out the money this time.

I won my iPad 2 as a holiday party prize from my workplace. Also, I do not own an Android tablet (yet). To avoid being labeled as a Fandroid, I will list what I liked about the iPad first (yes, there are things that Apple does well):- the hardware design is indeed well thought out: thin, light, and nice to look at- construction and quality appear to be top notch- the screen display is sharp and bright- iOS for all of its shortcoming runs very smoothly on this device- tons of apps in the App store- insane battery life -> This thing has the best battery life of any backlit display device I've ever used. It probably can go 4-5 days between chargings with average web usage.- instant on -> best thing about a tablet in general: instant web browsing- the perfect device for consuming media (Web browsing, videos, games) in bedNow, on to what I didn't like:- I have to use iTunes -> First thing that the tablet signaled for me to do was plug it in to the computer and install iTunes- no back button- Safari sucks -> First thing I downloaded from the app store was Dolphin HD- no expandable storage (well known)- no Flash -> sure Adobe has decided to stop supporting this for mobile devices, but for the moment there are still plenty of sites which use it. I was surprised by how many sites to which I can't view content. For a device which purports to be great at Web browsing, this kinda sucks.- limited customization of iOS - it's a tray of icons and that's it. Barely can be called an OS.Although I hate that the iPad doesn't have expandable storage, USB ports, etc, that is the Apple way. It always has been. The Apple ecosystem is very closed and restrictive. I am positive the iPad 3 won't have any USB ports on it either. However, the main reasons why I'm only giving this device 4 stars are: iTunes, iOS and the lack of Flash. For the amount people pay for this thing, you should be able to access 100% of the sites out there. All this being said, and it pains me to say it, Apple still has no equal in producing a sexy piece of high quality hardware. Disregarding specs (i.e. processor speed, RAM) the iPad 2 is still the benchmark hardware for tablets. Just think if this thing had flash, a USB port and you didn't need iTunes to access it from your computer. Now that would be something.One additional comment on tablet devices in general. Nobody NEEDS one of these things. They are, in my opinion, the ultimate in media consumption (videos, e-books, games, browsing, social networking) which is the opposite of productivity. Seriously, the main reason I wanted one was so I didn't have to wait the 120 seconds it takes to boot up my laptop to browse the Web. And also so I could browse literally anywhere in my house.

No cue cards w/ the iPad (original). No instruction book. Even w/ tutorials, lots of info re how to download ($),but no basics like how to access and play the music you have downloaded. Took LOTS of trial and error to figure out.On the up side, having a store nearby to take 1:1 classes is wonderful, and will learn much in short order.One other concern, I downloaded Sketchbook Pro to learn to draw in the computer. Present iPad technology requires a stylus pen w/ an eraser tip for iPad to \"read\" the marks you make. Any way to make a different type of interface sensitivity (pressure  vs electrical charge of skin) to enable a finer tip as needed? Yes, one can choose tips and brushes, but requiring so much surface of the eraser tip to create a line seems inefficient. Perhaps a wacom tablet would have been a better choice.Overall, it is amazing to have music, mail, drawing, search, calendar etc in such a small package.

After a few months; I keep saying this is the new personal computer. It will be laptops and desktops for work, and devices like the iPad for the rest of life. As it is, the iPad is almost that device - Its much more than I expected.I have zero gripes with the hardware. None. Its the most perfect piece of hardware I've ever used.

When I tried to register it Apple said it was out of warranty.  Long story short, this iPad ended up being a replacement for another unit sold by he iPad Shop back in 2011.  They received a replacement from Apple and sold it to my wife as new in September 2013.  While it might have been new it was recorded by Apple as a replacement to the original owner and thus received the warranty only at the time of return -- which by 2013 had long since expired.  Further, the serial number on the box did not match the serial number on the iPad.  After a back and forth with Apple customer service I finally ascertained that this was a replacement iPad intended for someone else and sold as new by the iPad Shop.  Apple's serial number tracking confirmed this.  It might have been a new unit but Apple changes the serial number on units they replace and would not warranty it beyond the \"original purchase date\".  Bottom line:  Go directly to Apple for their equipment.  That said, I'm not real pleased with Apple for failing to warranty an obviously new unit just because they assigned a new serial number to a customer who never received it.  I returned the iPad and bought another directly from Apple -- I'm not sure why.  Basically, I'm not pleased with either Apple or the iPad Shop.  But I am pleased with Amazon who noted that there have been similar complaints from this vendor and quickly refunded the purchase price.

More importantly, I am also a techie, so it was inevitable that curiosity would eventually kill the cat (cat being the product loyalty).  When I decided that I wanted to see if iPads live up to the hype, I didn't want to go all out - I wasn't going to purchase a plan from a phone company that will overcharge me for limited data use - especially not when I can tether devices to my phone!  I also wasn't going to pay at least $100 more to get a retina display since I view it as unnecessary for me- certainly not worth the extra money (even if I do have an instinct to have the latest and greatest). I decided that the iPad2 16GB would be appropriate to base my decision!The iPad is a good looking piece of hardware - but I would say that the software left me feeling limited in what I was able to do.Pros:-It's pretty - I do love a good looking piece of technology, and in that, the iPad does not disappoint-I like the multitouch gesturesCons:-Heavy if you are reading in bed-Edges around the screen mean that I have to stretch my thumbs that much further if I am trying to hold and manipulate the device with both hands (you can always cradle it in one arm and manipulate with the other, but it just feels odd no matter how you do it)-No expandable memory - there are very few android tablets that do not offer this- get with the program apple-the App Store was not user friendly and was stubborn when connectivity wasn't fast-I find the settings app to be all over the place - settings for a single app may be in three different places (wouldn't it be nice to get into an individual app's settings from within that app)Overall, if you are looking for something simple to use and don't want to be able to do anything too indepth the iPad is a perfectly adequate choice.  iOS is very straight forward, and generally user friendly as long as you don't want to change settings for them (ie you want to use default settings)- otherwise, you may have to go on a hunt for the exact setting you are looking for (if it even exists).

(reiview may still need revising)", "Author": "moon fox", "ReviewID": "R3LM338BSH5SJN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "You are there, standing in the middle of the electronics department, credit card in hand, about to spend hundreds of dollars on a touch pad you can trust to be worth the money, and a good product. The store clerks are saying different things to you about each pad, and you don't know who to trust. Ladies and Gentlemen, the I Pad 2 is the correct item for you! It consists of app selection, optional WiFi, and other sources such as 4g. Coasting around the range of $800.00, I would suggest this particular system over any of the other available touch pads. I tried another once. I didn't like it. I would choose ipad2 over a regular i pad. why? many reasons..It is faster.it looks better based on the fact that it is so thin..Its the newest version, so why not take a go before it gets outdated?The following are my views on this remarkable contraption. Also, I'm just going to call the I pad 2 an i pad just to make it easier. Just know that the I pad and I pad 2 are 2 different products. Sometimes, i will call it an i pad 2, but just so no one gets confused while reading this, there's a fact. Hope they help!First facts: This was a bummer, but based on Apple restrictions, the i pad 2 does not have flash, so it can't play online games or run certain programs that need flash. There is also no place for discs or flash drives, so you can't download saved work such as the data on flash drives or discs. You can't download programs like Microsoft office programs on this particular item, which is not fortunate, not to mention the fact that it doesn't connect to the printer. Hopefully some day it will evolve into better stats.Camera: For the most part i like the camera, but based on the fact i haven't seen or interacted with many other i pads except my own, which has a crooked, bury camera, it wasn't the best for me, but the other touch pad i owned had a horrible camera. I don't know how the other cameras look on the i pad 2 because i don't bother to put pictures of myself out into the public on the store tester i pads, so, keep the camera idea something to check on before buying. On the camera though you can make it look straigt ahead like a regular video camera or make it face the way you are looking at the screen, so it flips around depending on what kind of picture you want. I give MY experience on the camera a B gradeApp selection: Great apps! Many apps are free, but 1 app's full version wasn't free on the i pad like it was on my other pad. I still don't think that should be a problem. Also the apps appear with fewer selections on the screen based on certain categories then my other touch pad, which appeared in a long list that was helpful. Although i would beleive that all together the ipad 2 has a wider selection of apps. Unlike some touch pads, The i pad 2 offers netflix, and many other apps that are one of the reasons i got the i pad in the first place. Great quality. I give the apps a A grade.Battery: The battery doesn't last very long. Sometimes, it last a long time, but for the most part, I always have it charging. This is a issue if i want to travel with it. I'm going to have to get a i pad car charger... Anyway, the battery issue may just be with only MY i pad 2 but I'm not really sure. I would give this category a C or B grade, but it has some work to do before it reaches an A.App download speed: The apps for the most part download quickly, but there has been some times where the apps don't make any progress with loading so i usually have to delete it (and pray it will actually download) and download it again. In the end i always get ti worked out but its like, \"Come ON!\" you know? I give this category a A for it's amazing speed!WiFi quality: I love this category. Mine plays most H.D. videos and can just download apps from its app store rather then having to connect it to the computer to download things. That i can really appreciate. I can open up nearly all web-sights just the way they would appear on the internet unlike my last touch pad. I would say in order to get the full i pad 2 experience WiFi is a must-have. I give WiFi a A for great function!Speakers: Lets put it this way, the speakers... they could use some work. Sometimes when i have it to the maximum sound it is hard to hear. That is not something that i favor based on the fact that the i pad is like, 40% sound, but i still like the product. If you have this problem i suggest going to a quieter area or plugging in ear phones to assure you get the most out of your money.Covers: I don't have a smart-cover. Perhaps the smart-covers do save the battery and make the screen sleep when you put the cover over it, but i have a cover that's not a smart-cover and it is just fine. As long as you turn it off when not in use for long periods of time any covers should work. Note that the cover should fit nicely around the i pad 2, that way, it is a better buy and protects the i pad more. i would suggest a case to help protect it and make a nice little stand for it. You can't exactly rate a cover because there are many different ones, but here is my rate on how important a cover is to have to me. A B. Its optional, but a good idea.App Usage speed: Most of the apps i use are great, fast, functional, and don't have jerky movements. Take Talking Friends apps for example. They are fun, functional, and fast. Just how it should be, not to mention very clever. There isn't much to say about this particular category, but let me just say it deserves a A or B for nice function.Note where there should have been another Category view: I haven't had really any interaction with a regular i pad, so i can't say if the i pad 2 is really \"new and improved\", but i can say its good for me and very fast. Keep that in mind.Video and Photo booth: I love making videos, so i was happy to hear that the i pad 2 came with a camera ready to make some videos! It is a personal highlight. Also photo booth is fun. seeing what your pictures look like in x-ray vision, and flipped, and so much more. I really liked that. too bad you can't film videos in photo booth :( Also note that both of these are the free apps that come right when you get the i pad. the video is connected to camera app.Personal Favorites: I love the i pad 2, but my favorite features about it, are the following:.Its very thin and simple, which is very neat..The apps are great and so are their function..A i pad without WiFi is a very sad i pad..Videos and photo booth..speed!-------> ZOOMGRAND CLOSING..These are all my opinions of different category in the i pad 2. Comment if there is more you want to know about the i pad 2 and i will see if i have an answer to add to this review for you. Thanks for reading! Hope it helped!!", "Date": "January 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Another winner for Apple.", "Author": "cenobite", "ReviewID": "R3997V7E20A9YP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "All I can say about the iPad 2 is that it is simply amazing. The faster 1 ghz dual core A5 processor is a workhorse. The display is very high quality and is very easy on the eyes. Watching movies and surfing the web over WiFi is a joy, especially compared to the iPhone 4 which I have and love, but the limited browsing capabilities of the iPhone is enough to make you want for something larger. For iPhone users, the interface is familiar and easy to adapt to, and for new users, it is easy to learn. The iPod and Videos features are nice to have when travelling, and for those who like to read, the iBooks app is a capable book reader and there are thousands of ePub books and PDF files out there to load up on. For people that use Office to write letters and school papers, there is the iLife office suite which is Office compatible in most cases.There is a bonus for musicians. The iPad is becoming a professional tool for musicians with a plethora of music utilities, software synths (including a few Moog products), guitar amp simulators and even Garage Band to write and record on the go. The only thing is I wish it were more of an open platform and I wish it had stereo speakers, although most times I listen with earbuds.If you are thinking of the Kindle Fire or an Android tablet, the only advice I can give is DON'T ...

While its price may be a little expensive I defiantly think it's worth every penny.Part of the reason the iPad  is perfect for travel is that you can use it in any position, unlike a laptop, where you have to find a seat It won't ever got hot or overheat. Personally, I've had a couple laptops expire on me due to overheating. You always have to keep them on a firm surface so you don't block the vents. The iPad doesn't have these problems. You no longer have to grab a tray or giant book to set your laptop on when using it in bed.Video Skype works great on this tablet - the cameras make showing people things FAR simpler due to the front and back placement.The battery life is excellent! This thing can go for two days without a recharge! And that's with fairly heavy usage (try that with a laptop!)The touchscreen is extremely responsive, the machine is very fast - wifi works extremely well.The only issue I have is the reflective screen - I am not a fan of the reflective screen and have ordered a matte screen protector - not because I feel it needs protecting, but because I want to be able to read in various lighting conditions.", "Date": "December 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Unbelievable!!!", "Author": "mate", "ReviewID": "R2ABV8KH4CLFBK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was not sure if I'm gonna get a black or white but I'm very glad I got the white cuz it's really coooool!!", "Date": "December 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excelente", "Author": "Rafael", "ReviewID": "RQU2HO49E9KQ6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excelente producto, hice mi compra desde Venezuela y el aparato llego a tiempo y en perfecto estado, altamente recomendado el vendedor.", "Date": "December 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing", "Author": "CRiley10", "ReviewID": "R2VZ1QK5RIE4YH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My husband ordered this item (iPad 2, 16gb, black) for work. He loves it. We still have been unable to update it to iOS 5 because our wifi kept disconnecting on wifi on laptop but I think when we do that it will be faster. First day he had some slowness but not everything is great. We looked at getting some of the tablets on the android market and went to best buy to review. I liked the idea because the androids are more customizable but had reservations because 1. They are about the same price as iPads 2. Wasn't sure if I wanted to take that risk. 3. I have iPhones and know how dependable they are. However I found the toshiba thrive and it was cheaper. So that was our main focus. Toshiba thrive vs. iPad 2. On one hand the toshiba had USB ports, sd card ports and customization options, on the other if was not familiar with it. So we tried them both at best buy. Toshiba thrive looked better. It's graphics looked more fun, apps are cheaper..mostly free and all that. But it was more complicated, which i love because I like to tween things. My husband on the other hand...does not. So he wanted iPad...I wanted toshiba thrive but we wanted to talk to somebody who knew more about it. So we grabbed a guy who only deals with tablets. He said he has an android phone and likes it but as far as tablets go he said hands down iPad won. Reason was that apple makes one specific hardware for iPads. So they had it perfected. All their apps and music were specifically made for apple hardware so it had very little problems. Android market on the other hand is made from many different tablets, that are all made by different hardware. Therefore, if an app is made on a toshiba thrive, it may work great, but if you download it for your samsung thrive, the hardware is different so you are going to have more freezes with all, crashes or lack of working at all.In conclusion, iPad 2 so far is more dependable and perfected. I do believe however, with time, the android market will be more perfected.

I am for the most part impressed.Packaging: Apple has always impressed when it comes to their packaging. The box is very sleek and makes you very happy with your purchaseSetup: Now since this is only the wifi version, it doesn't require much setup.Now after everything was setup, I had fun connecting downloading all the apps and seeing what neat things I could do with it. I have an iPhone so I was apply to move over all my photos, songs, files, etc to the iPad and it was very easy. The plan for this iPad is to use in meetings and allow the customers to flip through the pictures or files that I am showing.Downfalls: The issues I have been having with this is that since I only have an iPhone 3GS, the tethering (personal hotspot) can only be connect through bluetooth so the internet isn't as fast as through wifi. I also wish there was some sort of case that comes with the iPad. I had to spend an additional $50 for a case to protect it. The front cases that Apple make I find are not helpful at all in terms of protection so I wish Apple would offer a better of assortment of accessories rather than having to buy 'made for the ipad' products.Overall I am quite happy and am enjoying the iPad.

Every time I try to place the cursor I get a pop to cut, copy etcReading books hard because thumb placement on device can inadvertently turn pages or other thumb can take you out of book and to the desktop. Also must hold iPad to read comfortably.Battery life is okay but I expected more (been using for 2 hours am down to 63% from fully charged, now down to 54%You need a computer as you have to sync with iTunes.  Also, have not found a way to delete apps off iPad without iTunesNo USB ports, only expandable through mini sdLarge for everyday use and since back is so slippery is hard to hold securely unless you have a case.Conclusion:The more I use it the less I like it.This doesn't do much more than a Palm Pilot and the palm can fit easily in your pocket or purse, has onscreen keyboard, graffiti, wifi, sd slot, Bluetooth, real word and excel software, email, built-in calculator, eReader, music, etc.  Too bad they are no longer available except on eBay.However, if you want a 10\" screen then a netbook is much more useful.  A real OS, flash support, large hard drive, screen can be adjusted for optimal viewing, USB ports, and the list goes on.  Portability is not much different and you can get a lot more for your money.  Price is another plus.I would never have bought this for myself.  As I finish this the battery is at 56%.

One problem that is apparent and has been stated multiple times is the weight of the device. It is too heavy to hold comfortably with one hand and the wrist may feel sore or achy after long periods of use. At the time of release, the screen was good enough for the average person to use. However, now with HD screens on devices less than half the size, the iPad's screen is seeming to pale in comparison. In addition, the battery life is quite exceptional. It lasts for weeks in Standby mode and also for long duration while reading or watching movies. Another point is that the cameras on the device are extremely poor, the resulting pictures looking too pixelated to view. You can forget about low-light shooting, because of a lack of flash and a poor image sensor.Software:iOS has always been a novel user interface, not for the unlimited functions, but for the extremely easy to use USER INTERFACE. Heck, I have seen kids not even 2 years old who know how to unlock and play their favorite games on the devices. The app store offers an abundance of games, and \"productivity\" apps. However, these productivity apps are not that easy to use. Lots of fonts supported by Microsoft Word do not work on these apps and the formatting is often completely messed up when transitioning from my laptop to the iPad. Apple needs to get Microsoft to build a preloaded app that will be accessible from other places in the OS.Overall:It's hard to recommend a product which is primarily limited to games, but if you're looking for an entertainment device, I would recommend the iPad 3 or 4 which have better graphics, a better processor, and a better screen.

Corbin", "ReviewID": "R3SJY0KTEVNOJK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This review is for the general public looking for something easy and fun to use. I am not a techie and have never owned a tablet until yesterday when I purchased a Galaxy Tablet 10.1. I loved this tablet but sadly had to return it this morning when I learned that I was lied too about its ability to connect with a VGA projector. After returning the Galaxy Tablet 10.1 this morning because of its inability to connect to a VGA output I found myself reluctantly purchasing an i-pad 2 16gb tablet. I wish I had never returned the Galaxy Tablet 10.1!! In terms of usability the Samsung Galaxy Tablet 10.1 was super easy and within minutes I was sending off emails using voice control, etc... however the I-Pad 2 left me flustered all afternoon long and I am still in shock at how complicated and convoluted getting things to work on it is. For instance 1) Before I could download anything needed for work I had to up-grade the OS! 2) Once OS-5 was installed I bought three (3) apps - keynote, pages, some PDF reader and I also installed Netflix for free. I had to uninstall and then re-install all four (4) app's in order to get them to work properly! Then, it turns out that the i-pad 2 doesn't actually charge whilst plugged into the computer via its usb port?! The battery life is not ten hours either! After five hours of feverishly trying to figure this thing out I was way below 30% battery life! I found the applications very frustrating to access and EVERYTHING forces you to use APPLE \"something or another...\" be it music, files, pictures, etc... if you like having options than avoid the i-pad... it leaves you feeling like you have been run over after all of the new accounts you have to set up just to get it to turn on properly out of the box.Compared to the Galaxy Tablet 10.1, everything was super easy to use and ready to go. It also comes with Polaris Office which is just as nice as keynote and pages in my opinion and it is FREE! I wrote a review about the Galaxy Tablet 10.1 expressing my disappointment that Samsung is being so short sighted about not having an VGA adapter for it. However, I could find no fault with the tablet itself or its applications. It left me feeling upset that I had to return it as I loved it so much. However, the Apple i-pad has left me so angry after hours of jerking me around that I can't wait to bring it back tomorrow and be rid of it. I also have the arduous task of trying to get my money back for the apps keynote and pages... both $10.00 each. I will confess that now that everything is finally set up and once you succumb to Apple's monopoly over how software is transferred from your computer to the tablet (i-tunes - sigh!) both keynote and pages preserve your Microsoft word and PowerPoint documents very nicely and is usable immediately. The Apple i-pad also has a proper VGA adapter for its i-pad... but it is NOT as user friendly as people or Apple itself makes it out to be and has left me wanting to return it regardless. Also, unlike the Galaxy Tablet, it does not allow you to swipe the screen from left to right and limits you to the basic top to bottom functions. The keyboard is inferior to the Galaxy tablet as well. For whatever reason the i-pad doesn't even have a tab key despite the fact that there is a blank space where the tab key usually is on any normal keyboard, including the Galaxy tablet 10.1! Just to type in some of my passwords I have to literally change the keyboard options three (3) times! This is only a problem for people like me who actually make full use of all the keys on a qwerty key board when making passwords and such. The Galaxy Tablet keyboard was simple and easy to use. It was as good as typing on a laptop keyboard! I also found some really great books for free via the Galaxy whereas most of the free books for the i-pad is just crap. Apple should spend more time on perfecting its products instead of introducing new ones every six months!Bottom Line: if you do not need to use VGA projectors than buy the Galaxy Tablet 10.1. I am heartbroken that I could not have kept that one. Leave Apple to those who like it for what it is. Personally, I'd sooner use a Remington Typewriter than the i-pad!UPDATE:I returned this iPad and purchased the Galaxy 10.1 Tablet again and couldn't be happier! I found a way around the projector problem too which is great.

If your warranty has expired then your only option could  be to throw away your Ipad or sell its parts on Ebay.17)Apple forced Amazon to remove the Kindle Store button from their mobile devices. They have also done this to the Barnes & Noble Nook Application.18)iPad2 probably has the worst operating system ever. The system is so restrictive it limits any chance of even limited productivity.

He heard about Apple's new iPad and wanted me to give him some ideas of what techies thought of Apple's retina display in the new iPad. So I went to a website I read frequently and one that is popular with the most technologically literate people on earth: tomshardware dotcom. I am includingsome of the comments voted highest and left by tomshardware frequent readers. It is hoped that this will assistintelligent readers on deciding if they should get the new iPad.Halcyon:\"Why didn't someone besides Apple use this most excellent screen first? Heck, Samsung makes the screen...you'd think they put something as nice in their own tablets.\"------Bystander:Frankly, I find it a little ridiculous at the resolution of this screen. I'd rather have the extra battery life and if you use it for games, they are probably going to have to use it at half the resolution for performance reasons.2550x1600 on a 30\" is about as crisp as i can see. Why do we need that on a 9.7\" screen?I won't refuse the added resolution, but I'm not sure there is much reason to spend extra money for it either.------Icemunk quoted by Del35:\"Back in 2010 when Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone 4, he claimed that the human eye stooped discerning the individual pixels when the pixel density is 300ppi. Hence he called the display on the iPhone 4 the retina display, which has 326ppi. Now we go forward in time almost two years and after all the human eye stops discerning pixels at 260ppi not 300ppi as previously stated.Also the phone I mentioned was a Nokia N900, at the time I also had a iPhone 3GS and a Xperia X1. Without knowing I had two phones with retina displays.\"The retina display is such a load of nonsense. The hype is designed to draw technologically subliterate zombies. The bottom line is that I simply can't imagine using a device like the new iPad that prevents me from experiencing fully close to 30% of websites due to its proprietary infestation (no flash and no java support!). On another note, I am happy that Samsung manufactures the retina display for Apple. Obviously they see no need to create a hype around it and seem not to be pushing it on their devices. For me the 1280 x 800 Pixel Super Amoled display of the the Samsung Galaxy Note is more than I need. Thanks but no thanks Apple. Give me connectivity, openness, and produce a device with a better that 2 in 10 repairability ratio and thus almost impossible to repair, also throw in a micro sd slot and price the device reasonably and I might consider it. Till you do that you will just be producing overpriced junk for  zombied morons using your logo as a shield.End of story.-----Icemunk:\"Fact of the matter is Apple displays are nice, and set a good benchmark, however they have been surpassed by newer technologies and better resolutions on many fronts. Most new super phones surpass 300ppi using LCD, OLED, and LED technologies.\"-----Icemunk:\"Yup, Samsung make excellent handheld displays!----------Vladislaus:\"My old phone with 3,5 inch 800x480 apparently also has a retina display long before Apple introduced it with the iPhone 4. Apparently all of a sudden, retina displays became much more common overnight.\"----------The Dane:\"Apple's retina displays still uses IPS panels. Much prefer lower resoution SuperAMO LED if image quality is important.\"--------Icemunk:\" There are plenty of phones with \"Retina\" display (above 300 ppi). For example, the Samsung Galaxy Nexus has a 4.65\" OLED screen with 316 ppi, however it is not advertised as \"Retina\" display, because that is a marketing gimick which Apple has a copyright for. OLED beats LCD hands down by the way.\"-------Shaod:\"Of course it has 316 ppi \"strictly speaking\" - ppi being simply the number of pixels it has per inch. That's ignoring that PenTile actually looks (subjectively) better than a regular display of the same resolution, while using less power because it has few subpixels.And sorry but 'retina display' is a marketing term. Like you point out it is completely subjective upon other factors such as where the screen is held and how good the eyesight of the user is.\"-------Icemunk responds to Watcha who  seems to work for Apple:\"You sound like a person who has little experience outside his Iphone and Apple products.. that is unfortunate, I believe you are caught up in the marketing of Apple and confusing it with science. It's tough to be a truly critical thinker when you are a fan boy unfortunately... hopefully you'll realize this in time. Good luck.\"-----Icemunk responds to Apple employee Watcha:\"I'm not going to argue about what a \"Retina\" display is, because that is a marketing device which Apple holds copyright. If you would like to argue facts, than I will present them to you:OLED is a superior display. Lower power, higher clairty, better viewing angles, true blacks and superior contrasts, higher resolutions, more advanced, higher quality, vibrant colors. LCD does not compare, even if you make up some marketing term about \"Retina\" display. OLED wins hands down, no matter how you spin it. And just so you know.. Apple won't be using LCD in their next Iphone, Samsung will make them a nice OLED display for it instead.\"Del35 replies to Icemunk:-------\"Watcha is unforuntetly lacking in real knowledge, and lost in the vast marketing machine produced by Apple. He reads his \"science\" from websites such as[...] which talks about nothing but Apple.. I feel for people like him, they don't realize they are being manipulated by marketing.\"I agree. In fact Watcha is even lacking in the basics of logical reasoning as evidenced by many of his past comments. Watcha does not even know  what  a contrapositve statement is or what a converse statement is or what  a tautology is. To illustrate his total lack of logical skills,  I recall a discussion with Watcha where he/she claimed that Apple made better product because more affluent people purchased them. I replied to him that his argument was akin to the claim that slavery was a better economic system because wealthier people held slaves in the 17th and 18th Century. He could not see the fallacy of his claim and held to it. Now it is known that Watcha works for Apple. So he is just working to put food on his table albeit in an immoral and anti-intellectual  fashion.--------Icemunk:\"I'm not going to argue about what a \"Retina\" display is, because that is a marketing device which Apple holds copyright.
