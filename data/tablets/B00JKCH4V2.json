say that I am impressed.  I went to the store to buy a 7 inch unit but quickly decided to upgrade to the 8 inch version.  There were several features that I was concerned about and the 8 inch unit just fit my needs better.* Larger screen size for reading* More basic internal memory at 16 GIG versus 8 GIG for the 7 inch unit* The ability to upgrade to a 64 GIG SD card instead of just 32 GIGJust remember that in my experience your need for more memory grows as you use your tablet more and if you buy a smaller memory upgrade capability you may regret it.  The price difference on launch day was only $40 more.  I already own 8 tablets in my family so my experience has proven this need for more memory.  As you add more books and more apps the memory slowly gets eaten up.  I went ahead and also purchased a Samsung 64 GIG Micro SD memory card and I got a Class 10 Pro series at a cost of $55.  It reads at 70 MB/s and a write speed of 20 MB/s.  For under $300 you will have a powerful tablet that has more memory (80 GIG) than a 64 GIG iPad Mini for a much lower price.Here is the link to the Samsung Memory that I purchased:Samsung 64GB MicroSD XC Pro Class 10 UHS-1 Read Speed 70mb/s Write Speed 20mb/s MB-MGCGB Ultra Fast Speed Memory Card with SoCal Trade, Inc. Memory Card ReaderSome other key features are:* A powerful Qualcomm quad core CPU operating at 1.2 GHZ  ( You can see the speed in using the tablet)* 1280 by 800 pixel display* A 3 MP rear facing camera* A 1.3 MP front facing camera* It weighs in at 11 \u00bc ounces per my scales* Bluetooth 4.0* Internal 16 GIG of flash memory and it goes to 80 GIG using a 64 GIG Micro SD card (Use a high quality Class 10 Micro SD card)* 1.5 GIG of internal RAM* A 4450 mAh internal battery pack* Android 4.4 operating system Kit Kat* 1080P playback and recording* A built in IR blaster to control your TV and other infra-red devices and an App called WatchON the help you control your TV and see what is playing on your cable service.* The tablet comes with a 31 inch charging and data cable that is a Micro USB on one end and a USB on the other.* It comes with an AC wall charger that outputs 5 VDC at 1 Amp and it will operate on 100 to 240 VAC and 50/60 HZ.* It features a power multitasking function that lets you see and use two apps simultaneously which is something that an Apple iPad cannot do. Very nice feature!* You can set up multiple users and limit the apps that they can see and use.* You can set up a child friendly and protected user interface.* You get $300 worth of free contentI found this tablet to be extremely versatile and very fast.  The quad core processor is very impressive and browsing the internet was fast and easy.  Adding my Gmail account to the tablet literally took a minute.  I put together a video to show you the locations for the controls and what the tablet looks like.  It is a bit long and I couldn't even talk about all of the items that I wanted to include. I apologize for the length of the video but I get excited over good technology.  Overall the tablet is impressive and it is well worth the money based on the quality and performance that I have seen.  I rate it as a 5 star item.You can register your device with Samsung Galaxy Perks and get more free items:* A $10 credit on the Google Play Store* 3 months free of Hulu plus* 1 year free of Boingo WIFI* 50 GIG of free Drop Box cloud storage for 2 years* Sirius 3 months free* 3 free audible books for new members* 3 digital magazines free on Zinio for 2 months* A free Polaris OfficeUpdate May 2, 2014:Last night I installed the Amazon AppStore and the Amazon Kindle reading app. I down loaded over 950 books and I was blown away by the speed of the downloads.  The CPU and strong WIFI connection really shines with its speed. I was using a strong 2.4 GHz WIFI and I downloaded the speedtest app from Google Play and I could download data at 13.36 Mbps and upload data at 2.09 Mbps. Since I am on ATT Uverse that is a reasonable result. The tablet can use either a 2.4 GHz or a 5 GHz WIFI channel. On the 5GHz frequency I got 17.71 Mbps download and 2.24 Mbps upload.I used the Amazon AppStore as I own over 1000 apps and it was fast and easy to download many of them. I could transfer them to the SD card to conserve my internal memory. I had to do this manually on some of the apps and others went to the SD card automatically.The sound of the speaker is pretty loud for its size. I paired the tablet with a Bluetooth speaker and the process is fast and easy. I use Bluetooth a lot and I was glad to see it work so well and Bluetooth 4.0 is the low power version to help reduce battery consumption.Over three hours of continuous work the battery dropped from 98% to 62% which is pretty good considering I downloaded over 950 books and 35 apps. I love the fact that I can use my Amazon books and apps so easily and still have access to the Google Play Store to download utilities and apps that are not available on Amazon. It is like having the best of both worlds.Photographs are easy to take and edit. I even shot some videos. I wanted to include some in my online video but there was not enough space and time remaining to do so.Using an app called Hangouts I was able to do face to face video calls and text messaging with my wife using our gmail account emails. The quality was as good as Facetime and the connection worked very well. I had to install the app Hangouts on my wife's iPhone 5S and the app is free on iTunes. The app was already installed on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 4.I continue to be impressed with the performance and capability of this tablet.I did want to add that the case is slippery and a little wide to hold so I suggest that you get a case to improve your ability to grip the tablet and hold it.", "Date": "May 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Faster processor than Galaxy Tab 3 8.0,  speakers and cameras downgraded, in stock configuration has exceptional battery life.", "Author": "S. G. MILLER", "ReviewID": "RRK720HRIPJYZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I already have a Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 but curiosity was killing me; I had to see what the differences were between the two model years. I think the Galaxy Tab 4 8.0 is a great tablet!  I am a Galaxy Tab fan from the beginning.  I still have and use a Sprint Galaxy Tab sph-p100 which is now several years old, but has been tweaked in nearly every way. I have watched the Galaxy Tab line evolve from the beginning. The GT4 8.0 is an evolutionary change from the 3.The introductory price was lowered by $30 on the first day of its release and it is currently $60 less than the introductory price of the GT 3 8.0.  To keep the price down other than the processor and the newer operating system there are no other notable improvements and some compromises were made.  The speakers and cameras were downgraded and the data/power cable was shortened.  In most ways this was less of a performance upgrade than a response to current market conditions.  Because of the competition in 8\" tablets... at the current price point consumers expect a more modern quad-core processor.  That is what we got.My first impressions...To me the GT4 8.0 seemed slightly zippier than the GT3 8.0.  However when I ran the applications that I actually use on a tablet most of the time (web browsers, book readers, video and music players) with the two tablets side by side there were no appreciable differences.  So I have to admit that my first impression may have been psychological... knowing that the newer unit has a quad core processor vs a dual core in the GT3 8.0 gives the expectation that the GT4 8.0 would be faster.  I ran approximately 20 benchmark programs on the two tablets side by side. The GT 4 8.0 was faster by most but not all measures.The Gtab4 8.0 has the same processor as the Motorola Moto G.  In nearly every benchmark I ran the scores were almost the same as the Moto G.  Since the Moto G has been out longer... if you want to know how the GT4 8.0 is going to perform using a certain benchmark just look at how the Moto G performed; you will most likely be within a very few percentage points.Most notably on the initial runs using the Antutu Benchmark program... the GT4 8.0 earned a score of 17281 and the GT3 8.0 received a score of 15263.  On the Antutu 3DRating Benchmark the 4 got a score of 2765 and the 3 just 1870. Neither is a speed demon compared to many other Android Devices. Neither tablet is meant to be a maximum performance gaming device.  Overall however both tablets have a lot of features for entry level tablets as noted in other reviews and both are very good, well rounded devices.Compared to the GT3 8.0, the GT4 8.0 shines running applications which take full advantage of its 4 processors and on chip Graphics Processor Unit. There are benchmarks where the GT3 8.0 outperforms the 4 due to its faster clock speed and the design of its processors and gpu.  Overall, however one must reasonably conclude that the new processor in the 4... future proofs it more as compared to the GT3 8.0. It will be interesting to find out what type of overclocking potential the processors and GPU have.  Whether either unit has any practical real world advantages for the a particular user depends entirely on the applications being used. A budding tablet gamer would be better off with the 4.My guess is that most users who do not run 3D games, photo or video editing apps would not be able to tell much if any difference using typical applications.  Unless there are applications that you want to use that you know are CPU intensive and are going to run better on the quad core tablet it would not be a worthwhile upgrade for most.  If however you are making a decision about which tablet to purchase... I would be willing to spend a little more on the GT4 8.0 than the GT3 8.0.Some advantages of the 3 are:1.  It has been out for a while and has a lot of community support.  It is easy to root; there are many custom ROMS and setups that one can take advantage of without having to reinvent the wheel.2 .The 3 has loads of cheap accessories available through eBay, Amazon and numerous retailers.3. The 3 has better speakers and cameras.Some advantages of the 4 are:1.  It has a newer quad-core processor that out performs the 3 in many benchmarks.2.  The Kitkat Operating System... as annoying as it is to have to learn new features... it is an upgrade. There probably already are custom ROMs to upgrade the GT3 8.0, but there are advantages to having a factory supported OEM version with the latest OS.3. The back of the 4's case has a faux leather finish that is not a fingerprint magnet like the shiny 3's is.  Personally I never take the 3 out of its gel case because you can't pick it up without getting nasty looking fingerprints all over it's beautiful shiny white exterior.4. {{{edit 5-18-14}}} After using the 4 for over two weeks I can report that in its stock configuration plus a couple dozen of my favorite apps, that it seems to have exceptional battery life.  I normally charge most devices that I depend on such as my phone every night.  I haven't charged the Galaxy Tab 4 for several days and have used it regularly, often with the screen at full brightness and the battery is still indicator still shows that it has 64% left. If you leave it in standby mode and don't use it... I can now report that it doesn't seem to lose more than a couple of percentage points of battery life in a day.  I am pleased enough that I raised my rating from 4 to 5 stars.  Kudos to Samsung for not putting a bunch of battery eating fluff in the stock configuration!Some disadvantages of the 3 are:1. Older Operating System.2. Dual Core vs Quad Core processor... albeit running at 1.5ghz as opposed to 1.2ghz3. The shiny case attracts fingerprints.Some disadvantages of the 4 are:1. Lower quality speaker and cameras.  The speaker is in the back so if you cover it or lay it down flat it will be muffled.  The 3 has great speakers and goes louder to begin with. The 4 doesn't sound bad but it is not as good as the GT3 8.0.2. The case has different dimensions than 3 so there are very few custom molded gel cases currently available. This of course should improve within a month or two.3. It is so new that currently there is very little support in the tablet community... you will probably have to wait a while to run your favorite applications that require rooting.I took many pictures and videos of the two units running side by side.  When I get the chance I will try to post those in updates to this review.So, in conclusion... if you already have a Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 the GT 4 8.0 is most likely not enough of an upgrade to justify purchasing the 4 unless you have a family member who could use a hand me down or any other excuse that you can make up.  If you are looking for a new tablet I would recommend either the 3 or the 4 because of the features they both provide features that have been well covered in other reviews.  I would be willing to pay a little more for the 3 than the 4 but not more than around $30 at this time.  Basically, if you plan to use the tablet for processor intensive applications such as editing photos or playing the latest 3D games you would probably be better off with the 4.  If you want to take pictures with your tablet and like to listen to the built in speakers I would lean towards the 3.  As far as browsing the internet, staying connected, watching videos or looking at pictures I doubt whether you will be able to tell the difference.  Both are good values as far as I am concerned.", "Date": "May 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome form factor!", "Author": "rpv", "ReviewID": "R395QQNO3RL548", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Samsung has done it again. They are releasing tablets at very periodic intervals. Samsung's fourth generation of Galaxy Tab series is as expected and for this price point phenomenal. I have been using Galaxy Tab 2 and 3 and I am very much impressed with Galaxy line of devices.  First, if you have not had any tablets before and can afford over 7\u201d, Get THIS! Yes, Get this 8\". It is ideal for reading books and emails. I had used a 8\" Tablet to read epub books (Aldiko) and it was a very pleasant experience. If you are a bit experienced and can afford it, I highly recommend the 8\". In my opinion 8\" is the maximum value for the money and features and hence I gave 8\" a 5 star. I also gave 7\" a 5 star due to best pixel density among all of Galaxy 4 series.Samsung has introduced 7\", 8\" and 10.1\" of the Tab 4 series. This year the space has become crowded as Samsung also has 8.4\u201d, 10.1\u201d and 12.2\u201d Tab Pro Series. They are pricier, but if you can afford I very STRONGLY suggest you get the PRO series just for one thing - RESOLUTION. I was really hoping the Tab series will go to a larger resolution. But again price/performance is a factor that drives Samsung to make devices at all ranges.Let's start off with salient points of all of the Galaxy Tab 4 series. I will later compare with the previous Tab 3 models. I have also listed brief specs of current leading tablets at the very end if you would like to really compare and shop. If you have Tab 3, don\u2019t upgrade. No need to. Those devices worked well a year back and still are. The photos look just as beautiful on them as they did a year ago!Some of Tab 4 specs have certainly become better, but not in a revolutionary sense. The pixels per inch ppi is the best in 7\u201d among all of Galaxy Tab 4 series. That is because all have same resolution and size is the variable.Look at three specs that really interest you and nail down the tablet you need.

Android 4.2I am not going into other details like accelerometer etc. as they are all standard these days, Audio support - AAC, AMR, MP3, OGG, WMA/ASF, 3GA/M4A, FLAC, WAV; MP3/MP4/Music Tones; Music Player; Ringtones, Polyphonic. Video support: AVI/DIVX, WMV/ASF, FLV, MKV, MP4/3GP, WEBM; Video Player; Video Streaming.The 8\" has a physical home button so are others in the series.  Also has capacitive Back and Menu buttons. Camera is a 1.3-megapixel front-facing camera for skype, and a 3-megapixel rear-facing camera. It is also equipped with an IR blaster so it will work as a universal remote on both your TV and cable box. Camera is only so and so, and I will not rely on it to produce outstanding photos. Weighs very lightweight. SD card capability is awesome! With prices plummeting for microSD GB cards, it is a great boon. Put all your music, books, photos on the SD card and you have a powerful computer in hand always! I personally use the 64 GB microSD card on my mobile devices. Get this mobileUltra (SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 6 Memory Card with SD Adapter - Retail Packaging.This tablet has both bluetooth 4.0\" and have USB Host capability. USB Host is one of the most under noticed features of Androids and is in my opinion one of the best features compared to iPad lines. What this means you get a USB Host cable also otherwise called OTG (On the Go) cables and plug in your USB thumb drive or other USB devices and the device recognizes it. I have used it with Alfa AWUS036H for a wireless project with Android PCAP Capture from reputable Kismet wireless.  GPS was spot on and I tried multiple GPS apps. It was bright outdoors (had to crank the brightness all the way up). I personally use Navigon from Garmin and have downloaded several apps.Finally, believe me, don't get mired in the spec game. I will say it all starts with what you can afford. If you really want a fabulous tablet experience, get the 12.2\u201d Tab Pro. Otherwise start with 7\u201d and move forward. 8\u201d is thin, lightweight and is awesome. Samsung is creating markets for all form factors and I would consider this as an exploratory stage. Just like Ford or Toyota has cars in different shapes, sizes and price range, so are the tablet vendors now. Remember the laptop wars, 10\", 12\" 13\", 15, 17 and even some 19\" if I remember right few years ago. We used to debate endlessly which laptop sizes are better, which has better speakers and so on. The time has come to fight it out for tablets!I tried following apps and they just worked awesome. A tablet is only as good as the apps you have and how productive it makes you. It's almost like the camera/lens analogy in the DSLR space. What good it is to have a great DSLR body if you have no good lens? Same with Tablet body and apps you have.WolframAlpha (I can go on for hours praising this. This is a truly genius app powered by hundreds of supercomputers in the background.

I wanted something that was less Appleish and more functional. The Galaxy Tab 3 that I played with at the local stores had the multiple windows, plenty of apps and functioned well. The Tab 4 is faster, a little more sleek and a few tweaks to the processor speed. I pre-ordered and had it at my door May 1.The things I really like:* The 8 inch screen is perfect for reading, yet compact enough to make it convenient to carry. If you have smaller hands, you may want to consider the 7 inch screen.* The quality is excellent with fit and finish to rival any tablet in its class.* The Android platform works smoothly and doesn't hang up as often as either the Apple iOS  6 or iOS 7 operating systems. No clunky screens, delays responding or freezes that I found common on the iPad Retina.* Plenty of Apps. I'm sure you could find more for Apple, but I doubt you will miss them. Every App I had loaded on my iPad was available in the Play Store.* Multi-window is great. Drag and drop from one to another is a useful tool.* Smart Stay works well. It monitors your eyes and won't go into sleep mode if you are watching. Look away, and it goes to sleep. Cool trick. And you can turn it off.* Easy setup: It only took a few minutes after the initial charge to go completely through the setup.* Easy navigation: Once you play around with the screens and buttons, it is very intuitive.* Great battery life. I am probably on it 4 hours a day. I charge it after about 8 hours.* Expandable memory. All my music is going on an SD card. No running out of memory like on the iPad, iPod or iPhone.* Screen is crystal clear. There are better ones out there, but you won't miss them.Almost forgot. The built in IR is great, especially if you have Samsung TV, Blue ray,  Sound, like I do. Very easy to control everything in my living room from my Tab.Things I didn't like - (very minor):* Cameras could be better. Quality is limited to 3 mp.* I can't find a detailed user's manual. Not a big issue.* No cases available as of today. I'm sure this will change soon.TIP: If you like taking screenshots, instead of pushing buttons, you just swipe across the screen with the side of your hand.

I picked this one up from Best Buy and returned it.The Nexus FHD is the best in terms of performance and visual quality. Its a great tablet, but the screen always seems to be SLIGHTLY lacking. The clarity is unmatched, but the size is just a bit small. Also, no micro sd is annoying. I understand Google wants to push cloud, but I like having kids movies loaded on the fly for long drives or restaurant tantrums.As such, I use my tab 3 8.0 the most. I think 8.0 is the sweet spot for tablets and I really expected this Tab 4 to improve on the problems of the Tab 3 but it didn't happen. The screen isn't any better, and that was the biggest issue. It's a nice screen but I don't get why Samsung thinks it can't just release generic tablets over and over again when the Tab Pro and Note line show what theyre capable of.Sure these are \"budget\" tablets in a sense, but the Nexus FHD looks and performs so much better. If it had a micro sd slot and one more inch of screen size I probably would have sold all my Galaxy Tabs.The Tab 4 felt a bit faster since it's running kitkat, but I noticed slight lag or stuttering at certain times and when I loaded the same app on both Tab 3 and Tab 4, it seemed pretty similar. Samsung really needed to put an HD screen in this instead of taking whatever leftover displays they had from the Tab 3, sticking it in a new body and calling it a Tab 4.---The best thing about this line of Tablets is the IR blaster.If you look up logitech remotes they run over a $100. This works just as well for me. I can use the WatchOn app or remote control apps from the play store.It's pretty amazing to sit on your couch browsing a website on your tablet while changing channels on your tv (all from the same device).If you can pay more, opt for the Tab Pro 8.4 which has an amazing screen or just get a Tab 3 instead of a Tab 4.", "Date": "May 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love it.", "Author": "lily", "ReviewID": "R1BW2AKFUBOA88", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have the Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 and the Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 and love them both, so when I read that Samsung was coming out with the Galaxy Tab 4 I just had to try it out.  It arrived within 2 days of ordering it.  I have to say that I am thrilled with it.  Everything about it is fantastic.  From the build quality to the performance it is great.  I love the 8\", it is the perfect size for me.  The back has a very nice faux leather feel, much nicer than the shiny, slippery plastic back on the tab 3.  The screen resolution is very clear and bright.  It is lightning fast, the quad core is much faster than the dual core of the tab 3.  It is just a bit heavier than the tab pro but not uncomfortably so.  It is just a great tablet all around and at $239 it just can't be beat in my opinion.  I own many tablets including the newest Nexus 7, the Kindle Fire HDX and the Galaxy as I mentioned and I love the Samsung products.  This Galaxy Tab 4 is a wonderful new addition to the Samsung line and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a tablet.  And as usual Amazon shipped it very quickly and free shipping with Prime.  A fantastic experience all around!! Forgot to mention that the battery life is incredible!!

I am very pleased with the performance and all of the apps and features that came with it. The Google play store goes on and on and you can find anything there.  I am still downloading new apps daily, while deleting the ones that I am not happy with. I have synchronized all my email/calendar accounts, sent photos and other things from laptop to the tablet, and found some apps for all kinds of stuff I didn't even know I wanted...all saved to the SD card so I can leave the main storage free to update the apps that came with the tablet. This tablet sure has a lot of things all packed in it and arranged so I can find when I want. And.....it seems to know when I mess up and asks what do I want to do. I am surprised the battery lasts so long. I did download from the Samsung site the operation manual and saved to the SD card and can pull it up when I want to check on something. The operation is so easy, I really have not had to do a lot of reading of the manual. I found a free app for wifi phone that I can use in a fix. That was the most difficult thing so far in following Google's instructions to set up a free account but it works fine. I use the speaker instead of ear buds. Good quality, for calling through the internet. The keyboard is pretty good although I did order and install a combo bluetooth keyboard/case which is removable. If the keyboard gets in the way, I can just take it off.  I did this so if on a trip, I have more options when doing a lot of email or notes.
