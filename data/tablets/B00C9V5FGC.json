{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Almost the perfect tablet", "Author": "Justin J", "ReviewID": "R2XVV1I6M74Y44", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "---Update 12/18/2013 - I've moved all \"updates\" to the end of this review for easier reading---My main reason for buying this tablet was/is to use it for taking lecture notes and reading books (college/work/technical books). I wanted something more portable than the Note 10.1 and this seemed to fill the void.Since this product has only been out for a day (when this review was written), I've had a chance to play with most of the features but not all.  This review is meant for those of you hanging on the fence, unsure of whether or not this tablet will work for you.First off, to save yourself some time, if you have no intentions of using the stylus for taking notes or modifying photos then stop reading this right now. The stylus IS the reason this tablet costs more than the competition and in my opinion it's worth the price.  Yes, there are more powerful tablets out there that are much cheaper but they don't have a stylus!  This tablet is designed for the person who likes to read/write and/or do artwork/photo-shopping.  If you don't need a stylus then you don't need to read this review (look at other products like the Nexus 7).The Pros: Taking notes on this device is a dream (very precise, even for mathematicians)-The hand-writing recognition feature is pretty darn accurate-I can use Microsoft OneNote to take notes (yay!) See \"comments\" section for more info on this(page 2)-Supports a 64GB micro-SD card (search Amazon for the Samsung card)-The interface is snappy and the graphics are fluid (for the most part)-Internet browsing and switching between programs is quick and smooth-The device is easy to hold and is very lightweight-The image quality is crisp, clear and bright-Did I mention, I really love the pen and it's ability to glide across the screen effortlessly?-The infrared remote feature is pretty slick and worked with my Panasonic T.V. without issue-Comes with 50GB dropbox account (for storing and sharing files with others)-Includes a $25 Google Play credit for downloading apps-Very quick to charge (roughly 2 hours)-Plastic finish is very slick and clean - Metal bends and scratches so pick your poisonThe Cons:-The price should be lowered by about $50 in my opinion because of the weak video card (see below)-The device comes with Android 4.1.x and not 4.2.x (Samsung hasn't announced when they will release the \"much improved\" update)***This no longer applies as I've found an app to replace this missing functionality*** -The following is a negative regarding Android and not the actual device: I made the mistake of buying a 64GB micro-SD card thinking I could store applications and games on it. Turns out, Android stripped out this feature and you can only put pictures, music and other \"documents\" on SD cards. So in short, the included 16GB of storage runs out before you know it (for power users). Save yourself the money, don't buy an SD-Card and use the DropBox service for storing all of your files-The graphics card is kind of weak for playing graphic intensive games but this tablet isn't really meant for that. For example, I played \"Real Racing 3\" and my framerate was probably 20-30 FPS. Still playable but kind of choppy. Additionally, when I unlock the screen with the stylus, the \"ink\" effect can be sluggish at times with a noticeable frame rate drop. Maybe an update will fix this.-Not really a con but lack of color selection(white)is kind of weak if you ask me - This can be fixed by putting it in a case.Overall: I bought this device to take notes and it does that VERY well. I can write complex math formulas and draw nearly anything I can think of without pixelation issues or accuracy problems.  The stylus IS the reason to buy this tablet. Don't go off of the specs or other reviewers who have emotional feelings toward this device.  If you're serious about taking notes (college students and corporate employees), reading e-books and playing the occasional YouTube videos and browsing the internet, you found your golden nugget. I did A LOT of research to find a replacement for my convertible-laptop (stylus enabled laptop) and I believe the Galaxy Note 8 was the right choice.I looked at the competition, even in the $1,000 price range and ultimately I chose this device. My complaint about the graphics card was to iterate the fact that this is not meant for hardcore gaming. Yes it will play Angry Birds and those other cheesy games but don't expect this to replace your IPad 3 or your modern smartphone. The graphic cards on those devices are way more powerful than what this little guy packs.After thoughts: For what it's worth, you can go to Best Buy and purchase the tablet. If you think it's not right for you, you have 15 days to return it and get a 100% refund. If you're a \"Silver\" status member at Best Buy, you get 60 days to try it out. After using it for just one day, I'm sold on the device and plan on keeping it. Your mileage might very. But I believe the portability and the note taking features of this device far out-way the cons. Other reviewers compare this tablet to other tablets that don't even have a stylus. That's just not fair. That's like me comparing a wheel-chair (which has a specific purpose) to a bicycle (which has a different purpose). Yes, both will get you around but they are designed for specific needs and I personally feel that the Note 8 will satisfy those looking for a stylus enabled tablet at an affordable price.**Updates to my review*****Update as of 7/1/2013*** Please see below for my actual review - I just wanted to let others know that my experience with this tablet has been great with no problems. For what it's worth, I am left handed and I have no problems with the built-in S-Note application (or any application) for that matter. My hand does not bump into things and I believe this tablet was made to accommodate both left and right hand users (despite the storage location of the pen).***Update as of 6/3/2013*** Apparently the comments section is so long, users have stopped reading the How-to's and have asked me how to use the microSD card for external/internal storage. Here's a quick excerpt so you don't have to dig through the comments:1. Firstly, you need to root your device which is VERY easy - Download and run an app called \"Framaroot-1.4.apk\" - Here is where I downloaded it from:[...]3. You can also follow these instructions for rooting your device:[...]3. Download one of the apps from the Google Play store and read the program's descriptions. It should walk you through the whole setup process.Root External 2 Internal - [...]or...GL to SDHope that helps!***Update as of 5/23/2013*** If I haven't covered something here or in the \"comments\" section, feel free to drop me a question in the comments section and I'll do my best to help you out. Thanks again for all the \"Helpful\" ratings you've given me. It makes me happy to know I've helped some of you. I understand I can't please everyone so keep your negative comments to yourself please :-)***Update as of 5/7/2013*** Attention U.S.A. owners of the Galaxy Note 8. While we all know the U.S. version didn't get phone capabilities (3G data), I found an app on the Google Play Store (free) that allows you to make and receive phone calls for free. All you need is a wifi internet connection (Starbucks, your home wifi, etc) to place calls, and a Google Voice account (free). Firstly, go set up a free Google Voice account so you can get your free phone number (do a search on Google for \"Google Voice\".) Lastly, download the following app from the Google Play Store: \"Groove IP Lite\". When you run Groove IP, the application will want to link itself to your Google Voice number (assuming you set this up) and the rest is very seamless. The app allows you to use a Bluetooth device for making calls or the built in speakerphone. Enjoy!***Update as of 5/6/2013*** Look at the last page of the \"comments\" section for my instructions on installing flash and rooting the device. I've posted instructions on how to install Flash and root your device. I had too many emails to respond to so here ya go!***Update as of 4/25/2013*** I have found an app on the Google Play store that will allow you to use your micro-SD card as the \"internal\" storage and it's free. Additionally, after reading some tech articles, I figured out how to get Flash working on this device along with being able to quickly, safely and easily root the device. If you want more details, post your contact info in the comments section and I'll email you whatever it is you're after. I'm afraid Amazon will delete this review if I post links to 3rd party sites.***Update as of 4/23/2013*** I still love the Note 8 and highly recommend it. If you have any questions that I don't answer in this review, feel free to comment and I'll respond back to you when I can. Thanks for all the \"Helpful\" votes!", "Date": "April 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "The reason i bought Galaxy Note 8.0", "Author": "animalsrush", "ReviewID": "R2R2RY65P8QO4C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had the Galaxy Note 8.0 for a week now and decided to share my thoughts. I come from a heavy iOS/OSX background owning Ipad3,ipad Mini and Macbook air. This is my first Android tablet . I also own a Sony Xperia Ray android phone but use it mainly as phone. I also bought Xperia Tablet Z recently and had to return due to build issues after few weeks .. I won't get into specs or detailed reviews ( there are quite a few good ones out there) but will list out why i chose Galaxy Note 8.0Build : Everyone is complaining about the plastic build of Galaxy note 8. It is actually very solid and has no squeaks. The backplate gives a little when you push it. However most will use a case to put their tablets so this is a non issue. the white plastic looks classy. Also as this is plastic the Wifi and bluetooth connections are solid. I get min 4 bars even in bedroom with router in living room. Compared this to ipad mini barely went upto 2 bars. Sony Xperia Tablet z was terrible ..It dropped connections so often it was unusable . However not a big fan of where power button and vol buttons are . I would have preferred  power button on top and vol button on left so when i hold tablet they don't get pressed accidentally as this tablet is designed to be held in portrait mode. Also love the physical home button ( I think this because of habit i guess all Apple devices have them :) ). This tablet also weighs as much the ipad mini and Xperia tablet Z so it is very lightweight and easy to hold in one hand for long hrs.Display : Even though the display is 1280x800 the display is very crisp. Movies and pictures look really great and text looks real good at decent reading distance. The display is way better than Ipad Mini but little bit lower than Xperia tablet Z which is 1080P. However i prefer the Galaxy note 8.0 display as it is easy on eyes. The colors popped so much on Xperia tablet Z it hurt my eyes. Small text ( try msn.com website) looks bit bad when you look closely . But you would never use tablet close to eyes anyways.Battery life : I get about 2-3 days on single charge with moderate use browsing internet, watching YouTube, some games etc. Mind you I keep brightness to 25% , Bluetooth and GPS off , app notifications off. This decent but not as good as iPad mini.SDXC card extension : This was the biggest sell for me. I bought a Sandisk 64 GB class 10 SD card and put about 40 movies on it and my books and i am all set for long trips. None of the ipads have the feature.Non Propriety port: The charge port is micro USB. So with my universal USB charger i just need to carry one cable that will allow me to charge my MP3 player, my tablet, my cell phone and my portable amp as all use micro usb port. Reduced the clutter of cables i need to carry when i travelForm factor : I was a big fan of Ipad mini for its form factor. I tried to use 10.1 inch tablet ( Sony Xperia Tablet Z) even though light became cumbersome after holding in hand for more than 30 mins. The 7 inch is too small , 10.1 inch too big , 8 inches just perfect for both reading books and watching movies. However i do prefer the 4:3 format of Ipad  mini Vs 16:9 format of Android tablets.Multi tasking : This is brilliant feature and this device allows to have two applications next to each other . This is good when you want to take notes and when browsing a website or a doc . Also the performance is so good there is zero lag even with 6 applications open in background. Ipad doesn't have true multi tasking and there was lag on Sony Xperia tablet Z even though it is high powered device. However that may be due to Sony's bad skinning of jelly beanPerformance/Touch Wiz : Samsung has heavily skinned jelly bean with touch wiz. However there is no lag as this tablet has gobs of power . The 2 GB RAM and quad core processor keep this humming along. I had sometimes 6 applications running in background which were cpu heavy but no lag or abrupt app closures. With Ipad mini apps sometime closed abruptly due to aggressive memory management. iOS is one of the best tuned OS and uses the HW properly . Android still needs horse power to run smoothly.Speakers : They are placed in the same way it is on ipad mini. I like that because when i watch movies in landscape mode the sound is more rounded as my palms cup them. The are loud but not quite as loud as Ipad mini but way better than the ones on sony Xperia Tablet Z. The sound is loud enough to hear in a noisy env. I will not use the tablet for music as i have a very good Sony mp3 player with amp .. So the speakers are only for you tube videos or movies . Mostly i will use headphones anywaysIR blaster : IMO this is just a gimmick. The Watch on and Peel work for me only if i point my tablet at  proper angle to the device it is controlling. The app has so little features. The one implemented on Sony Xperia Tablet Z is awesome. It recognized all my HT components complex menu options and controlled them without me having to point the tablet accurately at the device . However i am hoping someone will come up with an awesome remote appS Pen : This feature is new to me so i am completely fascinated by the tech. It recognizes my handwriting well and i am using it regularly for my meetings ( Handwriting to text mode) . Need to play lot more with it but love the ability to do this . Not many tablets have thisPrice : I think it is reasonably priced ( I bought mine for $379) for features and functions it provides. people don't seem to mind exorbitant prices apple charges for their devices because they are cool :) . Spen , SDXC extension, touchwiz all makes this tablet worth every pennyEcosystem and OS : Android OS is not as polished as iOS even in its current Jelly bean format . However it is more fluid than ICS. As to apps there are quite a few now in play store that are designed for tablets. Luckily for me all the apps i use i found them in play store . Also android is more open . So it allows me to manage my files the way i want and also root the device if i choose to. It is open to other ecosystems like Amazon market place so i am not tied down to a single ecosystem. This is huge benefit as i was tired of Apple restricting everything to iTunesCameras: I will use them only for skype so no issue with the ones on the tablet. Will never use the back camera for taking pics so it doesn't matter to me what quality pics it takes. however what ever pics i took for testing were decentThings i didn't like : The backbutton and multitask button are so sensitive that when watching movies i have accidentally swiped them and it went back to home page. there is no easy way to disable this . Also not a fan of the location of power button or vol rocker. However the samsung galaxy book cover case is alleviating this a bit ..Overall it is a very solid tablet filled with ton of features and at reasonable price(IMO) on a very flexible and open ecosystem . You just can't beat that. Also it is way better than iPad mini (IMO)..", "Date": "June 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Read this comment before you make your decision", "Author": "Sean H.", "ReviewID": "R3JHHZS2R3V1IH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am a Samsung lover; purchased Omnia, Galaxy S, S2, Tab 7, Note 2, Galaxy note 10.1 and Galaxy 8.0. I purchased this device  on August 15 and used for 3 weeks now. There is one thing that I want to inform you before you purchase this device.If you want to purchase this device, DO NOT update your firmware until Samsung releases firmware update 4.2.2, meaning use As-Is for now.Firmware issue!After the purchase, there were at least 3 firmware updates from Samsung and the latest firmware came with touchscreen freeze function which made this tablet pause for 3 ~ 5 seconds. Yes, touch response literally freezes. So I contacted Samsung tech support and they recommended hard reset of the device. I went to XDA Developer website and found there were so many others who experienced the same as I did and do. Worst part is that Samsung is not aware of this issue.Samsung has been releasing Android 4.2.2 (current version is 4.1.2) which has the fix for this issue, but there is no release date available for Wi-Fi version.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update on 10/7/2013Samsung finally released 4.2.2 and touch screen issue resolved with the update.BUT!!!!! now I notice that internet application closes out when it tries to load flash player on some websites. Samsung should have tested thoroughly. Note 10.1 was great, but it seems like 8.0 will have few more bugs to fix!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update on 11/20/2013I did not notice until recently that you are now able to store some programs on SD card. This was one feature that was blocked until the update on 10/7/2013. What does this do? It frees up your internal storage by moving some of your large size apps to SD card. Do note that note 8.0 only has 16GB space, so this will enable you from running out of your internal memory. Few of the previous galaxy phones had this feature, and now on the note 8.0. I was able to move appox. 3GB data to my 32GB SD card. Note 8.0 vs NEXUS 7? Now you may want to re-think because NEXUS 7 does not support micro SD. However, flash player issue is not still resolved...just to remind you.", "Date": "September 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Ultimate Productivity Tablet", "Author": "Kidd32", "ReviewID": "R7DN4HQW4IEL2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If what you need is a device for watching movies or TV shows on, carry around in your coat pocket, in a purse, or small backpack, this is not the device for you. If that's your intention behind buying a small tablet, then there are better options for the price- much better bang for your buck if you must. This includes the Nexus and the slightly more expensive than the nexus but cheaper than this device Apple Ipad Mini (sorry that was a mouthful). However, if you like to or need to take notes and work in a setting where you are constantly on the move, need information quickly, have to organize information well, and increase your overall productivity - then this is the ONLY device I would personally recommend.As someone who is in the medical field, this device gives me the ability to take patient history notes in an organized and secure manner. While there are other great note taking programs out there, the game changer for me personally was the S-Note program with its hand/wrist discrimination feature and hand to text mode. My handwriting is absolutely terrible but it does a phenomenal job of text recognition.  You cannot do this on the iPad and other android devices. In the past, I even invested in a wrist discriminating sensor thing for the iPad and that was a HORRIBLE idea. Not only can and did damage my iPad screen, it also did terrible job writing where I was actually writing. The text was always distorted above the pen contact point.Additionally,  with this device, I was able to make a pdf template on my computer, import it into the SNote software and now use it to take patient history in a consistently organized manner. I never miss those frequently missed questions (like smoking, and packs a day, etc.). Some people have asked me why the the 8 over the 10, and the answer for me is very simple: I can't carry around a ten inch tablet in my white coat, it's just too big. The note fits perfectly in the inside and outside white coat pockets for men's sizes (>36), it sticks out a tiny bit in the smaller sizes (<32). My one recommendation, however, is to get a cover because you don't want to scratch your screen against your equipment or vice versa.As a student, I can use this to annotate lecture notes and Powerpoints very easily. While the software can't import Power-point files, it's very easy to convert them into a PDF, especially on Office 2007 and then send it to yourself or load it onto the Dropbox. I can then import the pdf into Snote and note away.As far as storage goes, these files aren't very big but if you are planning on using more storage (movie's etc.), then invest in an expandable memory. It's one of the big advantages of this device over the Ipad mini.Yes it has a hefty price tag but the features are un-paralleled for productivity. However, the way I see it: you pay 300 for the premium specifications on the device, like the graphic card and processor, and another 100 for the S-pen feature. For me, it's an investment worth making if you are using it for the right reasons.Battery Life: Great but depending on the frequency of use, might require charging.Feel: I have big hands so it fit's pretty easily. It feels like holding note pad. If you have small hands and want to use this in a manner similar to what I do, try it at Best Buy first because I can see this being a problem for people with smaller hands. By try it, I mean really try it, pick it up and write on it for a few minutes.Note taking tip: The only tip I can give so far is that if you are taking notes and are getting frustrated by your wrist hitting the buttons (menu + back), flip it 180 with the camera on the bottom and the buttons on top. Works like a charm for me.If you have other questions, please feel free to ask. I will try to help in whatever way possible.Update:Importing tip: So this isn't the most intuitive of things for previous ipad/iphone users but to import files or even just bring up a menu while in a program, click on the button to the right of the \"home button\" (the one that lights up and looks like the top of a college ruled paper). I know this seems like a stupid tip but believe me - when I was first trying to figure out how to \"import\" things into S-note or find how to reach the table of contents in the Kindle App, I almost lost it.S-pen compatibility: First thing, if you buy a new stylus, make sure you undock the previous stylus before using the new one. The new stylus will not work if you leave the old one in. Secondly, http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-S-Pen-Stylus-Holder/dp/B0076Z3GMG/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid;=1367301937&sr;=8-4&keywords;=S-Pen+Samsung+Galaxy+Note, that stylus feels nice but the one that I bought is slightly off calibration and the text is a few mm off. If this isn't a big deal then go for it. However, if you are OCD, this can be really frustrating.", "Date": "April 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice tablet", "Author": "Akash", "ReviewID": "RDDXHOZLHZ9Q1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I started looking for an ideal tablet a month ago, I was sure that I was going to get the iPad mini. Then I started doing some research and found galaxy note 8.0. It was selling for the same price of $329 at staples, so it was all about the features. The reasons why I finally chose galaxy 8.0 were:1. Micro SD slot - This is a big one for me. I can dump all my music and quite a few movies on the card. I can also transfer photos from my SLR onto this and use it almost as a storage device.2. Higher resolution, 2 GB RAM and quad-core processor - The resolution, though better than the iPad mini, won't knock your socks off. However, I was pleasently suprised by how nice and vibrant the colors look on this tablet. Also, I think this is the only tablet that offers you 3 different display options: Dynamic, Movie and Standard. The quad core 1.6 GHz processor really shines while playing graphic intensive games.3. Android ecosystem - This is more of a personal preference. I replaced my iPhone with an SG3 last year and I found the google ecosystem to be much more open. There's definitely a downside to this, but I like the fact that I don't have to buy adapters every time I want to connect my phone or tablet with an accessory. It all just works, and it is only getting better with time.4. S-pen - For a student, this really helps. It completely replaces pen and paper. Also, the tablet comes pre-loaded with polaris office, which can be used to view and edit word and excel documents or view power point presentations. It is really nice and easy to use.5. Potability/8 inch screen - This is again a personal preference, but I think 8 inch is the perfect size for a tablet. Not too small, not too big. It is just the right size to carry when you're on the go. It is lightweight and convenient to hold in one hand.6. IR Blaster - Hardly a must have feature, but it'll be intereseting to see how well this works with my Samsung TV.7. Playstore credit - You get $25 google playstore credit to purchase apps, music or movies when you register the product on samsung website. You also get 3 free months of Hulu, free boingo internet for a year as well as $50 credit towards watch on (I have not used it yet, but when I do I'll come back and update this review).8. GPS - Even though this is a WiFi only tablet, I can install applications such as CoPilot and download maps for navigation offline. It only costs $9.99 and you can try it for 2 full weeks before buying. I was going to purchase a new GPS separately, but not anymore.One thing to note before you buy this tablet is the battery life. It is not stellar. It is in fact just okay. But there are things one can do to increase the battery life, especially when the tablet is in sleep mode:1. Install juice defender from playstore. Mine is always in \"agressive\" mode. This really helps extending the stand by time.2. Make sure WiFi is off during sleep mode.3. I get notifications (email, facebooks etc.) on my smartphone. So, there's really no need for me to get those same notifications on my tablet. I also have automatic sync turned off. I sync manually when I open an application.4. GPS and bluetooth are on only when I need them.5. I use cleanup master and I have the automatic background task kill switched on. I also regularly clean up the background tasks.6. I keep the brightness at about 25-35%. It is enough when you're indoors, and it is easy on the eyes. When I am outside, I turn the auto brightness on. I also have the power saving mode on most of the times.7. I use avast anti-virus on this tablet as well as on my phone. I don't know how much it helps with the battery but it definitely helps guard against unwanted virses, malware and spyware.If you do just this, you should notice a significant increate in battery life. With moderate use, I am able to go through 2 full days before it needs recharging. However, if you're browsing the Internet or playing youtube clips constantly, don't expect the battery to last more than 7-8 hours.I have no problem recharging the tablet every 2 days. However, if you're on the go all the time and need the tablet to last more, I'd suggest buying a separate 9000 mAh battery. It is portable and it gives you 2 full recharges. It is not an ideal solution, but atleast you know that just for $50 more, you can go without plugging in your tablet for almost an entire week.In the end, I think the reason why there are so many tablets out in the market is because no one tablet is ideal for everybody. Every tablet has it's adantages and disadvantages. The tablet that you buy depends on how you're going to use it and what you're going to use it for.Hope this helps.Update: Some people have been asking about the storage space available for apps on this tablet. You get close to 9.5 gb for applications. Music, movies, pictures and other documents can be stored on a sd card.", "Date": "August 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love It...FLASH!", "Author": "Candy Cane", "ReviewID": "R182DZGJV2WAKV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my personal review as a female, middle-aged, not-so-tech-savvy user.  The new Note 8.0 is very similar to the Galaxy Note 10.1 that I have been using at work and love.  That was why, even with the price, I chose to buy this the minute it was released.  I also own an ipad 3 and a kindle Fire HD so i have experience with all of them.  The size of this was a big bonus as it it much easier for dropping in my purse and hitting the road.  I chose this over the iPad mini because of the expandable memory and the S Pen.  it was a slam dunk because i also wanted work functions that I don't feel I have with my regular iPad.  This is an entertainment tablet as well as a very functional work tool.  The S Pen is the major draw...and be careful to not lose it because replacements are pricey.I love the ease and function of the S Pen.  And considering the price, I am pleased that it tucks away so neatly and stays securely. I have misplaced it twice, so it is just a matter of time until I have to replace it...however, it doesn't feel as though it will ever just fall out on its own.  I really love it because it feels like using a real pen and the handwriting is actually MY handwriting.  Taking notes or just jotting things down is much easier on this than on my iPad.  It is much clearer and a simpler function.  The pen feels much more natural too.  I have that rubber-nub ended pen for the iPad and the S Pen BY FAR is superior.It is slightly larger, obviously than my Kindle Fire HD 7...but that inch makes a huge difference when reading and watching videos.  It doesn't feel any more cumbersome than the Kindle.  They are both very sturdy and feel well built.  My son will now inherit the Kindle HD as this is replacing it.  The Note fulfills ALMOST all of the entertainment functions of the Kindle with obviously greater functions for work.  The main function I will miss on the Kindle is the Prime Video streaming app from Amazon.  Amazon has made the app available to iPad and the Kindles, but no other Android device. ***update*** a helpful soul directed me to download xScope from Google Play and the flash player in that browser works GREAT with Amazon videos.  Be sure to set your security to allow apps from other sources, at least during the first run with the browser because it sets up flash from the Adobe site directly.The expandable memory is a big deal for me and I immediately put in a 64gb  memory card.  Samsung warns that a 64 gb memory card may cause instability and that 32 is the biggest recommended.  I've experienced no instability yet and will update if I do.  I store and play a lot of music and videos with my Note.  The internal speaker is acceptable, but not awesome.  The sound on the Kindle is much higher quality as far as the internal speaker is concerned.  The headphone jack is loud and clear.  I hook into my car speakers and use this as a video device, GPS, and music player.  I also use it for audiobooks with the audible app.  That app is slightly different than the iPad version, but equally as functional and kind of more sleek in how it operates.The screen is crystal clear and beautiful.  (The S pen is a bonus here too as well. Fewer fingerprints). Watching videos and taking pictures is a pleasure..  The camera takes great pictures.  The camera is comparable to the Kindle HD7, but not to the IPad.  Front and rear facing cameras...the one in the back seems to take better still shots.  I guess the screen isn't as great as my iPad, but I have to admit that I can't tell the difference.  That may be because this screen is so small or because my eyes are 43 years old and nothing looks all that clear anymore.Kindle and ebook reader app differences:  I didn't notice this at first, but someone asked about it so I checked.  There is a significant difference in the appearance of reading ebooks between this and the Note 10.1.  This is much softer looking, like real paper.  it seems to be much easier on the eyes and I believe will make a significant difference in how tired my eyes feel after reading for any extended period.  It is a nice improvement!", "Date": "April 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Virtually Flawless: a Must Buy if you own an Android phone. 8 inch screen size makes the difference over Nexus 7", "Author": "Ashley D \"Silk\"", "ReviewID": "R3J2H1P6O0K987", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After almost 4 weeks worth of use:I will not comment more on anything else I have written about below, suffice to say that battery life while excellent is still about 70% of what the iPad mini provides(I still get about 8 hours of continuous use and 16 hours of standby on average each day.) Beyond that, in all other aspects, this has been a superior device(for me at least) than the Mini, which I still carry around as a backup(mainly for tv shows,movies and when battery is low on the Note). Why? essentially because the screen resolution, reminders and use of widgets far outclasses the ipad mini. Seriously, if you currently have any kind of Android Smart Phone and are familiar with the quirks*, buy the Note 8. If you have an iPhone and do not care about widgets and getting reminders/notifications that repeat, can be autosnoozed and that you can actually hear...then stick with the Mini.*Quirks: The Note 8 and any Android device can have battery drain while on Standby if you do not tweak your settings and/or have poorly written apps downloaded. My advice is to steer clear of free apps sponsored by ads, since that is a major culprit: buy the paid versions or do not download. As to tweaking Android settings, there are many pages you can Google depending on the version of Android you have, but this is a useful site:[...] Size compared to Nexus 7: I am hearing Ad Nauseum about how much better the Nexus 7 is for the price. Well that is not valid, in my opinion, if only because the size of the two tablets is so different. Yes really: even though the specs say only one inch difference, there is a huge difference in viewing and clarity: the Note 8(like the iPad Mini) is the perfect balance between a 7 inch tablet which is too small to be useful for productivity, and a 10 inch tablet which is too bulky and heavy. Comparisons in price should take this into account, as well as the stylus,lack of SD card support on Nexus 7 and the superior battery life(especially during standby) of the Note 8. Comparing the Nexus to the Note is like comparing apples to iguanas- a slight exaggeration perhaps, but you get the point. Go into Best Buy to compare: the Note looks about 30% bigger compared to the Nexus...It isn't, but that is how much more comfortable it feels.Update 8 on day 7: BATTERY LIFE- One comment I received was that someone was having only 3-4 hours battery life just using the S-Pen and no other app. While S-pen is a battery hog, that should still not be the case. I have to specify that I only have my brightness settings set to 35-40%(more than adequate even for video) and only turn on my GPS if I need it for directions(I get at least 9 hours of continual use). These two settings alone can easily double your battery life and is something I have automatically done on all my tablets for several years. Also, I have only the sound notifications I need turned on-for example I do not need Facebook, Ultimate TODO etc and other notifications, since my S3 smartphone handles those.Again, this makes a significant difference to battery life. Finally-the first day I received the Note I used it down to less than 5% and then fully charges overnight. Despite any other advice you may hear, I have always found a memory issue in batteries which is avoided by running down the battery as soon as you receive a device and fully charging it,then doing the same thing every few weeks. Battery life is always going to be subjective from person to person due to the difference in usage-but screen brightness,gps and notification settings are key factors for any user in preserving battery life on a mobile device.Update 7 on day 6: One negative I do have is the amount of bloatware on the device 16GB became 9.8GB. Fine if you had 32GB to start off with...but since the only current model is 16GB that sucks. Anyway, the good news is that even having downloaded 50 apps and hundreds of pics, several smaller event videos and dozens of books, I still have 7.8GB left. Does limit number of movies I can watch from Google Play-DRM Issue with not being able to move these to SD Card. I could root but in the past that has caused instability(especially after system updates), so I do not do that anymore.I would be tempted to deduct half a star for the bloatware(Google magazines. Allshare etc) but some people do actually use these. But they should just make them removable instead of system integrated. Titanium backup can help you remove these, but again I do not really want to Root, but I knew this going in and did not want to wait for a 32GB model. 90% of the time I do not need more than one or 2 movies on my device, so I can live with that.Oh, I almost forgot, the Samsung keyboard has a feature you may not have noticed, but let me back up a bit. My favorite keyboard ever is SwiftKey(on my Galaxy 3), but I do not need it on this device, since the built in keyboard does the same thing for predictions and learning etc(IMHO). But also, if you need to go back on what you have written to edit,you can just run your finger/stylus across the keyboard to scroll backwards or forwards, up or down till you get to the area you wish to edit. Much simpler and faster than trying to pinpoint with the end of your finger/stylus. i discovered this by accident, even though it is in a user guide somewhere I later discovered.Update 6 on Day 5: The latest thing I have noticed, but did not mention yet, is the Smart Stay feature(under Display settings, default set to on). It ensures that the screen never shuts off while you are looking at it: so even if you have a 30 second screen timeout to save battery power(for when you glance quickly and then forget to turn off screen), you can read uninterrupted. It actually makes most sense to have a screen timeout of 1 minute for me I have found.Also, if there is a large amount of text on the screen, and you have a one minute timeout, the smart stay feature is phenomenal. I had not commented on this before, because i already use my Samsung S3 and so take this feature for granted. Turning this off is a mistake, since, trust me, you will use more power turning your screen on each time it times out otherwise.Today I received over 80 emails, read them and dozens of weather alerts and emergency alarms due to flooding around here. This is about 4 times more in notifications than usual, but no discernible increase in battery usage over the normal usage I have mentioned below. I am going to do some intensive video watching over the next couple of days and post the results on battery life.Update 5 on Day 4: With the Quad Core processor on this, it puts the Nexus 7 to shame. I can multitask at least 9 different apps with no noticeable lag or significant power drain. I read another review say that they drained 30% of the battery after reading 10% of a book. I read 30% of a book(150 real pages on Kindle app in 2 hours) with only 10% drain. So it is not so much how many pages you read but the amount of time it takes you to read, and the brightness setting. Don't get me wrong, the IPad mini(only one you should compare to due to size of screen)has significantly better battery life, but the Note is up there with the best of the Android tablets, and I will certainly trade some battery power against getting customization and widgets.Update 4 on Day 4: I installed 7 more apps today-New York Times,Ultimate To-do,Slice, Ap-memo, Data Vault and a few others. They were all optimized for tablets, as compared to even a year ago when that was most definitely not the case. With better resolution tablets and Samsung increasing their tablet market closer and closer to 50%, developers are churning out tablet optimized apps like crazy. This will solve the only real issue I see with this tablet. Then Samsung should bring out an amoled screen version of this device and with a higher resolution-something like 1900 x 1200. Even though that will not be as high as the future retina display iPad mini- the difference will not be noticeable. A combination of a more user customizable operating system,more tablet apps and better resolution, will(IMHO) mean the iPad Mini, even with a retina display, will get a run for the money. Also, I would stress again, that if you are going to browse the web a lot-definitely pick this(with Firefox) over the iPad Mini. Why use a device that does not allow you to increase font size and be able to fit that to the screen? i hate that about Apple mobile products0THeir OS does not currently work with Textflow software.Update 3 on Day 4: Battery life continues to be excellent. I have discovered that the S-Pen has an incredible utility, even if you are not a student. By pressing and holding on the microphone symbol next to the space bar on the Samsung Keyboard, you get a box pop up with several icons: Clicking the one with a capital T and and a pen on it, changes the input method in any App so that you have a scratchpad at the bottom to hand write. This is then converted into text. For longer emails or blogging, this is very useful. I also used it for shorter Facebook comments and jotting down smaller notes. My handwriting is not the best, but with a little practice I was able to be 80% accurate on the longer notes and pretty much spot on for the one or two line notations. I may not draw or take long lecture notes, but the S-Pen now had substantially higher value than originally thought. Also, it hands down beats a regular stylus for responsiveness, scrolling and smoothness. It literally is an extension of your finger, but with a much higher degree of accuracy and precision.Update 2: This is really just to warn anyone reading the first review (most helpful one listed), that there is a comment there in the middle of the review, that says the Note is really fast to charge-in 1 hour. That is not my experience and I cannot see how that would be possible, unless the tablet is at 80% or something already or maybe if there are no apps apart from what are preloaded(though i cannot see that either)- which admittedly may be what the reviewer meant. However I didn't read it that way and I think others might not either. I got the charge down to 5%-at which stage certain protection protocols are built in(cannot be altered that I could find), so the screen remained dim. It took 3 hours with the unit fully shutdown to charge back to 100%. Just an FYI to anyone thinking that there is an amazing 1 hour charge time. Hope this helps.Update 1: After 2 solid days of continual use I can say that the battery life is excellent in standby and while in use. It loses less than 1% per hour on standby. This is with WiFi AND GPS continually running, and updates for weather,email and other PIM apps running in the background.I get 15 hours of use per day with 7 hours on standby and 8 used continually for web surfing, reading, app store and downloading apps.Resolution is wonderful-screen angles superb at any angle. Better looking graphics than iPad Mini. nexus 7 and even pretty close to Kindle HD-despite the Kindle having much higher specs for resolution on paper at least. Samsung just make the best screens. I would,as other users have commented, not use this Note for intensive gaming, but RPG games run superbly and Google Play video looks just as good as anything the Kindle HD 8.9 can provide-again, specs are not everything, Samsung havedesigned their screems to maximize appearance and richness of video. Battery life when playing movies is great(compared to other Android tablets),I was able to watch 3 movies lasting 5 hours and still be on 60% battery. But i will test more, since in my previous experience, battery life runs down much faster when you get below 50%- a quirk of the Android operating system. This is an area where Apple still dominate with superior battery life. more to follow in the days ahead.Original review:FYI I got my device from Best Buy(barely 2 days ago) and since I am a Premier Silver member, I get 60 days to return.If you already use a Samsung S3, then this will be the perfect accompaniment: a very sleek, fast and eye-catching device-get Samsung's own smart cover for this since it is the best available currently at Best Buy(in white at my store) if you want the slimmest,lightest case that does not cover the bezel(my preference only).I essentially got this to be able to read my blogs and news articles, surf the web, track calender,reminders, to do lists. I can do this on the S3, but this way I get to save my eyesight a lot more: which suddenly has become an issue in my mid forties!! I also have an iPad mini which I love-but on any iPad device there is an issue of hearing the alarms, customizing sounds and changing snoozes, auto snoozing and generally having nagging reminders. There are some Apple apps that can help but not many to choose from. Android does not have that issue because of the open source operating system. So I use the iPad mini for portability,surfing reading,email,video facebook and games, and my S3 smart phone for all the reminders and tasks etc-they still sync onto my iPad mini, but I hear the alarms and get the nagging reminders on my phone. The Galaxy Note 8 now lets me have the reminders,surf the web with a better Firefox browser that has text reflow for virtually ANY site, shop, read and take a few handwritten notes excellently(Facebook app is awful on Android-Feria on Ipad Mini is a dream). Unlike other reviewers, the S-Pen is only useful in a minor way for me, since I am not at college or studying. All the other benefits listed above make this worth it for me on their own. One of the best things is the use of the Firefox app-being able to turn almost any page into easily read text format only, with adjustable font,is priceless when so much time is spent on the Web. As is the ease of which you can zoom in on any page, and the text will reflow to the larger font and fit the screen(also syncing my Desktop web Bookmarks and history): Essential, but something no decent browser on Apple devices can successfully accomplish-so on my Apple devices I tend to use Flipboard, Taptu, Zite and other RSS readers to fulfill the News functions.The reason I am deducting one star is threefold: The price should be $350 to match the iPad Mini(the only real competitor to this product IMHO); There are not that many Android Apps truly optimized for Android tablets-unlike Apple and the S-Pen still does not have its incredible usefulness shown because there are only a handful of apps written for it. I deduct only 1 star for all 3, since the S-Pen is NOT the main reason I got this Tablet and with software updates/more apps on the way, I know this will change-so i deducted only a quarter star for this, a quarter star for the price, but half a star for Android not having more Tablet Optimized apps. Gaming is something I do rarely,but I find the Ipad mini/ my S3 to be excellent for that, since the battery life is phenomenal on the Mini especially. I will write more about battery life on the Note, watching movies etc when I have used it a few more days. I certainly am glad that I purchased at this moment however and hope this helps everyone who is considering, but confused by so many tablets out there right now.If this has been helpful or not please vote accordingly.

The weight is ideal. It feels very nice to hold and work on it. It is definitely expensive than its counterparts, but having a well integrated stylus makes it an excellent buy. I was able to run many apps/games/navigation/music/youtube videos. Fast and smooth. I have verified using a 32 GB SD card and basically carry all of your music. The total storage is effectively 48 GB. (I have a 50 G box and other cloud accounts, so I don't store movies/songs on this).  Also Google Music works great on this, I have close to 10,000 songs on google music. The playback and speaker quality is ok, I expected a better speaker for its size.  1.6GHz quad-core processor and 2GB of RAM makes applications butter smooth. I for someone like the plastic finish and I think this is great for what it does. Lightweight, no scratch and looks awesome on this device. Lot of press criticizes Samsung for its plastic, but who cares. Customers seems to love this design. I also confirmed this Note 8.0 takes 64 GB microSD card.I use Google KEEP for note taking on Galaxy Note 8.0 and it is awesome. I like everything on Google ecosystem as it is seamless. Keep is in early stages and I am sure google will update to keep it modern. Note taking is one of the string points of this tablet and there are several apps out there. Keep, OneNote, Samsung's own apps and lot of third party apps. Keep debuted only in 2013 and is simple and powerful!Pen is awesome and it is almost like holding a traditional notepad for notetaking. Kids will love hundreds of sketching apps. This has S-GPS as opposed to A-GPS, but gets GPS locks easily. My NAVIGON is great for in car navigation. Now to get a mount! Obviously I need to mount lower and not at dashboard level. Big maps, nice navigation. Google Navigation will _NOT_ work without a mifi or some sort of mobile connectivity. You can use Freedom Spot Photon 4G Mobile Hotspot (Black) which I am using while on car. Freedompop uses Clearwire technology and has great coverage where I live.

Even though it is weird to hold against your head, speakerphone/bluetooth are excellent options. I really dislike carrying multiple devices.* WatchON is basically useless for me, as I have an older TV. Samsung is trying to get you into their ecosystem* Expensive, its competitor Google Nexus 7 Tablet (16 GB) or even Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (7-Inch, Wi-Fi) are far cheaper. If you are not into latest, you can take a step back. My recommendation will be for ASUS Fonepad which is a 7\" and has a phone functionality built in. It may sound weird, but integrated devices are all the rage.* Would have preferred a better camera.I am giving a 4 star mainly because of the price, If it is $300, would get a 5 stars! I am sure price will drop steeply once demand increases. I will upgrade to 5 stars once price drops!Some of the apps I have tried  on this tablet so far are :- Amazon Kindle, aLogcat, Asphalt 7, Battery Monitor Widget Pro (shows accurate measurements), Car Reminder Maintenance Pro, Chrome, DragonVale, Draw Something, Google Drive, eBay, facebook, Flashlight (very handy), Flipboard, Keep (though Samsung note app is great), Samsung Apps, LastPass, Merriam Webster dictionary, Navigon, Google Nav using MiFi, PAC-MAN (!!), Pogoplug (gives me Terabytes on the go on wifi from my home private cloud), RealCalc (great calculator program), Nike Running+ (great visualization), Subsonic, Skype, SwitchPro widget, Taptalk HD (awesome app), Tweetcaster pro, Twit.TV, Withings (weight watcher app), Youtube, Terminal Emulator.Ask me questions and I will answer within a day or if you want me to try some apps on this tablet.

I made the exception in this case, because I believe in the ultimate usefulness of this product by Samsung.  I have owned many apple products and for a time, I did enjoy them.  However, I always grew tired of apple tablets and smartphones because I realized that they usually only work well with other apple products.  Furthermore, every iteration of smartphone or tablet was only incrementally improved upon by the company.  Apple makes very nice but linear products.  They offer a very streamlined approach to technology at all levels across their product line.  They are great, if you only wish to do very simplistic task; such as surf the internet, buy content from Itunes and apps via the app store. Ipads are great at content consumption but are equally as cumbersome to use as a content creation device.  This is truly where the note 8 shines.  It's a great bridge device between your smartphone and your laptop.  The S pen is what makes this tablet a winner.Before any are quick to state that the Note 8 is overpriced relative to the Ipad mini or even the regular sized Ipad I ask you to consider the following:  The Ipad mini is quite literally built with the same internals as the two year old Ipad 2, which still sells at $399. The mini costs apple $115 to make and they sell it old components and all to consumers for the price of $329.  They are making a killing selling the same thing in a smaller package.  Is Samsung doing the Same with the Note 8 relative to the Note 10,1?  In my opinion, no.  The Note 8 is an improvement from the standpoint of a faster processor, better software integration with the S pen and what I feel is better build quality and increased durability.  The note 8 is a refined and improved version of the note 10.1.  The 8 has added greater functionality over the 10.1. these improvements to both hardware and software justify the price.  After all, the same individuals screaming about how costly this device is are the same ones that are willing to buy a mini which is only $70 cheaper than the dated and yet bigger ipad 2.  the tech which powers both the larger note  10.1, and now the 8 came roughly 8 months apart.  In short, this means that the cost of these components has not depreciated to levels which one could consider significant, when one considers the cost of manufacturing both iterations of this deviceThe apps argument is largely a creation of tremendous marketing skill on the part of apple.  There are few apps which cannot be found on both platforms and for those few I have always been successful at finding a suitable substitute.  I have found that a few android apps may lack some of the features of their ios equivalents...but these instances are dwindling inn number.  The same can be said of the app optimization argument.  Apple does a great job of creating apps specifically tailored to both the phone and tablet space but android is making strides to do the same.  I am willing to sacrifice the aesthetics offered by apple for the functionality offered by Samsung and android; specifically the note 8.Finally, an additional point is worth the mention.  I always find it funny when people are so obsessed with bashing screen resolution.  this is an 8 inch screen and quite clear and beautiful.  It is not a 50 inch LCD.  How many pixels can you cram into any tablet screen, before it becomes pointless and frankly entirely ridiculous?  Yes, there are tablets that are cheaper with better resolution but these do not employ the use of a fully functional stylus.  My point here is that i'm certain that higher screen resolution would have certainly come at the expense of greater S pen integration, software and functionality. These are the primary selling points of this tablet.  The galaxy note 8 is the best production tablet on the market at any size.  Its feature set alone makes it a must have for either a student or business professional such as myself.  I hope this helps those of you on the fence about purchasing the tablet.  For me cost and expense are relative terms. Yes, for $400 you could buy a full sized Ipad. But at that size, ask yourself how much will you use the device?  Will you get your money's worth?  I for one would consider this money well spent because I will actually use this device quite heavily making it worth the cost.  This is something I could never say about any Ipad I've ever owned.

This thing packs a punch for many different reasons....here's why:Packaging:  Easily beats Apple in the packaging of this product.  It comes in a sleek and stylish \"wood\" type box.  The first thing you see when you open it is the tablet itself with a nice screen protector on it (that you have to peel off).  Below the tablet is the charger and USB cable along with a getting started guide.First boot:  The tablet boots right up at about 75-80% battery life.  It is your usual Android experience:  login with your Google account and Samsung account (can use the same credentials) and all of your contacts, apps, settings, etc. are synced to the device.  If you don't have either of these accounts or if it is your first time with an Android device, you can register and get started within minutes.  A very simple setup experience.  Once you get into the device itself, Samsung has integrated some tutorials and tips into TouchWiz to help you get familiar with the interface.S-pen:  Okay, let's be honest.  You should (and most probably do)buy this device for the S-pen alone.  This thing is awesome and is miles ahead of any other stylus out there.  Samsung has done a fantastic job.  The handwriting to text works flawlessly (even with my mediocre handwriting).  S-note is pretty great, but the pen works with most other note-taking apps I have tried as well (OneNote, Evernote, etc).  There are lots of magical things you can do with this pen as well, just search for things like \"S-pen smart hover\", or \"S-pen shortcuts\".Screen:  The screen packs a ppi of 189 at 1280x800.  For an 8-inch tablet this is great.  I have tried 10 inch and 7 inch tabs, and I think I have found the sweet spot at 8 inches.  It's the perfect size for portability while not sacrificing real-estate.  When this is held up to the Nexus 7 it's a pretty noticeable difference in screen size.  I can hold this in portrait mode with one hand easily, and landscape with two without my arms getting tired.  For those debating between 10, 7, and 8 inch screens.....go with the 8.  I've owned all sizes and can say this is my favorite so far.Speakers:  Nobody buys a tablet for the amazing speakers that they have.  That's just not what they are for.  I can't complain about the speakers on the Note 8 though, they get the job done.  My wife was watching a trailer on my tablet in another part of the house and I could hear it crystal clear.  Good enough speakers for what they are meant to do.Form factor:  I bought the black, 16gb version.  The black on brown looks super sexy and feels great in my hand.  I honestly love the feel of the tablet.  Some people say \"oh it's plastic and not as sleek as the iPad metal\".  Well, plastic doesn't scratch as easy and is lighter.  Plus, you can take the back off of the tablet and access whatever you need.  Most people will be using a case anyway, so let's face it....who cares about what the back is made out of.Battery:  Wow.  Battery life is amazing on this thing.  I went 2 days on the first charge (at 75%).  Everyone knows that the first couple of days you buy something new you use it more than you normally will....well that's the case with me and I still got a good 48 hours out of a 75% charge.  I left the tab at 50% the first night, woke up 8 hours later and it's at 48%.  I can live with that.  Of course if you are doing heavy 3-D gaming it will eat the battery a little more, but for normal productivity and social tasks, this battery is a trooper.Camera:  You are using your tablet for it's camera capabilities? That's weird....don't do that.  It's nice to have a front facing camera for skype and the likes, but who really cares about the rear facing camera and it's capabilities.Storage:  Having an external SD card slot is nice....but having it accessible without having to take off the case is even nicer.  Am I right?!  I have a 64gb SD card in this thing, bringing my total storage capacity to 80gb.OS:  Android is miles ahead of iOS right now...just look at the market share.  If you are debating between investing in the iOS or Android ecosystem....trust me (a former heavy iOS user)and go with Android.  If you are sick of seeing release after release after release and nothing changing in iOS then switch to Android.Misc. perks:  I can use this as a remote control for my TV....that is awesome.  When you purchase this and register with Samsung you get $25 to the Google Play store (as of 8/12/2013).  You also get 50gb to Dropbox free for 2 years, $50 to the Samsung movie store thing, and 3 free months of Hulu Plus.  When you put that into account, the price doesn't seem so bad.That being said, the price is the ONLY thing I don't absolutely love about this tablet.  I got it for $379.00 on sale through Amazon, so it's definitely on the higher end of the <10 inch tablets.

Nearly everyone throws on a case for their tablets (or phones) now a days. You DON'T even feel the plastic back that everyone whines about. Glass back breaks. Aluminum or polycarbonate backs glaringly highlights every scratch or defect. All adds to the weight. Plastic backs hides scratches and as I said, when you put a case on, you never even touch the plastic back again.Battery life lasts me the whole day. On average I get about 15 hours with about 3-4 hours of on screen time before I get down to about 20%.

I've used this feature to have something like a website open on one side while I take notes on the other.In short, I highly recommend this tablet to students who would like to ditch taking paper notes to save space and have ready access to their notes at any time!", "Date": "October 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good.

It will set the example for future technology to come.The productivity on this is incredible. I use it for note taking. The cameras just suck. Pretty soon there will be tablets just like this with S-Pens, HD screen resolution, 8 megapixel and 3 megapixel cameras, and probably some 3D features. The screen resolution on this is absolutely great and handwriting is very natural, though. Ignore the complaints.Trying it first at Best Buy is what I recommend.

It\u2019s a bloated and unnecessary launcher. While Samsung has toned down some of the Fischer-Price \u201cmy first tablet\u201d icons a bit, I still don\u2019t like manufacturer launchers of any kind\u2026 nor do most users. Optimize the standard Android OS for your hardware, allow for direct updates and let the user tailor their experience to their liking!!! HINT: That\u2019s why people buy Android.I\u2019ve installed Nova Launcher Prime because it\u2019s fast, highly customizable, can use most icon packs from ADW and Go (if you\u2019re into that sort of thing) and allows me to run my entire tablet from a single home screen and well-organized app drawer.[...]S-Voice is a problem. It\u2019s not SIRI. It\u2019s not Vlingo. It\u2019s not Google Now. It\u2019s not as integrated as Samsung thinks and it\u2019s not good. The solution is simple as all you have to do is use Google Now. While S-Voice does plug in to the Samsung apps very well, the problem is that the Samsung apps aren\u2019t as good as what they\u2019re designed to replace.The words of Jesse Pinkman allude to a serious problem: \u201cMAGNETS, BITCHES!\u201d Often found in \u201csmart covers\u201d that automatically wake up your tablet, they automatically destroy the GN8\u2019s magnetically-driven hardware that allow the S-Pen to work so well. They create dead-spots in the screen.The solutions are many: find a cover that uses weak magnets, which is to say: spend the extra money on the OEM cover; for the same price as the OEM cover, purchase the protection overkill of the Otterbox Defender case made for the GN8; hunt for a case that doesn\u2019t use magnets and still offers good protection.THE MEDIOCRE:The price is another problem: at $399, it\u2019s pretty steep for a small tablet not running iOS or Windows 8RT, both of which are much more integrated into the professional environment the GN8 is designed to serve. While the S-Pen is incredible, and its integration makes it a steal when compared to the thousand dollars you have to shell out for a Surface Pro, most people aren\u2019t the kind of users that will actually get a value-added experience with it. My suggestion is to go with the N7.2\u2026 or Galaxy 3 Tab 8.0\u201d, which still comes with great perks and allows you to control your TV (more on this later).Granted, the GN8 comes with a ton of perks as long as you buy it by 30 September 2013 [...] and it is on sale at Staples for $329.99 (at least it was when I wrote this review).There is also another price work-around to be considered: buying refurbished. At $299.99, you get all the perks of the special promotion and you don\u2019t have to pay sales tax (it\u2019s used). By the time I factored in all the tax savings and perks, I paid a bit less for a GN8 than I would have for the only other affordable tablet that could meet my needs: the second-generation Asus Nexus 7 (N7.2).This isn\u2019t your typical \u201cused car\u201d version of a refurbished item. The packaging is complete, the device looks great and honestly\u2026 in my experience, the failure rate for factory-refurbished equipment has been lower than that of new equipment.Not to mention it\u2019s better for the environment AND the domestic economy when you consider Samsung does their refurbishing right here in the United States.You get a decent 90-day warranty you can extend if you want to. I root every Android device I buy, which voids most warranties, so this isn\u2019t a major concern for me: you pay your pennies and you take your chances.By the time everything was tallied up, I purchased a refurbished GN8, spare chargers (both for a car and AC wall charging), an OTG micro USB to USB adapter (more on that later), a folding Bluetooth keyboard, a case and ChromeCast for only $15 more than I would have paid for the GN8 alone, with California sales tax at my local Staples.In-Depth: The 96hr ImmersionThe last four days have seen my experience evolve from fascination to ham-fisted frustration to my girlfriend literally being pulling me away from the tablet by my ear because of blood-blasted (\u201cblood-shot doesn\u2019t begin to describe it) eyes to now, at this present time, actually feeling an emotional connection similar to the one I feel with my lovely and well-trained dogs.Samsung has come a long way with their packaging over the last decade, coming close to the unboxing experience Apple products have soiled the electronics market with. I know that the \u201crecycled\u201d materials a bit of propaganda, but I like the message the propaganda sends.The first thing I noticed is that the GN8 feels as good in the hand as it looks in the box. It really is a beautiful device, taking full advantage of the slick design that has made Samsung\u2019s Galaxy line so successful. It is much lighter than the solid feeling tells the sense of touch it should be and is a very high-quality product when it comes to materials and finish. However, the back is a little too slick to use without having anxiety over dropping it, but a person that uses a tablet without a case probably has advanced-stage syphilis as well\u2026 and aren\u2019t worth knowing.I\u2019ve read some reviews that have attacked the use of polycarbonate for the body, saying it feels cheap. There are no signs of poor build quality in this tablet. The same can be said for the GN8\u2019s most significant competitor: the N7.2. Both feel solid without feeling chunky.As far as durability is concerned, it should be noted that polycarbonate is used in things like safety glasses and bullet-proof windows for a reason: it\u2019s strong and can take a beating. Metal is cool and feels good, but it also dents and arcs, destroying delicate electronics. The GN8 is also built with the second generation of Corning\u2019s Gorilla Glass, so durability of the device itself should be excellent.The same can\u2019t be said for the metal foil laminate of the bezel around the GN8s camera in back, which is already starting to chip a bit from setting it on my desk when charging. Samsung should have used the same material they did around the perimeter of the GN8\u2019s shell.When combined with a portable Bluetooth keyboard (a must if you\u2019re serious about getting the most out of your tablet purchase), the entire package comes in at roughly a pound.This has been a blessing, because my typical load for a day in the field includes the following: a DSLR with two lenses, assorted filters, an extra battery and USB, HDMI and component cables; a prosumer point and shoot with an extra battery; a stereo microphone with pop filter and table-top tripod, USB cable; a portable solar panel; eight rechargeable AA batteries (to run my mic, mobile phone, flashlights, a portable scanner, the GN8 should it actually run out of power, and a STERIpen water purifier- sometimes when I write that I \u201cwork in the field,\u201d I\u2019m being literal); assorted equipment to clean and maintain my camera equipment; pens, markers, highlighters and a notepad; a simple grooming and first/last aid kit (it\u2019s important to make sure fingernails and calluses are taken care of when meeting clients); a waiter\u2019s wine opener, Chapstick, gum (because it\u2019s important to be able to celebrate a new acquaintance whenever you meet her); condoms (because I\u2019m an optimist); a cigarette lighter (for what comes after the bottle of wine); a flashlight; a head light; the aforementioned scanner and water purifier; my glasses; cables and power adapters for my phone and GN8; Bluetooth headsets; a Kobo Glo with a few hundred books on it (nothing will ever replace e-ink); a pair of gloves; a small knife; a pair of gloves; a small tripod; two liters of water; and before getting the GN8: a bit seven pound laptop, 1.5 pound spare battery and a one-pound charging brick\u2026 all packed into a strained assembly of water-resistant fabric that is considered a \u201cpersonal carry-on item\u201d!Most of this equipment is used at least two or three times a week (even the water purifier when I\u2019m hiking or don\u2019t trust the tap water), and I only want to eat, shower and dress in the morning, so doing a different load-out every day is impractical.What I\u2019ve found over the last week is that I can do about 95% of what I need to do, when I need to do it, with the GN8\u2026 and it has taken my typical load-out from a shoulder and back abusing 28 pounds to a \u201c comfortably feather-weight\u201d 17.5!RELEVANT LUGGAGE TANGENT: While a backpack would carry my daily load more comfortably, satchels are mandatory for quickly accessing photography gear. Also, the FAA lists backpacks as \u201cluggage,\u201d whereas a satchel, as long as it fits within the maximum allowable size, is considered a personal item akin to a purse or briefcase regardless how much it weighs.The display, which is slightly larger (by the ruler) than the N7.2\u2019s, is wonderful once it\u2019s been optimized for text and reading. Understand that it is a two-step process to make the GN8\u2019s screen really earn its praise. First, turn on \u201creading mode\u201d in the drop-down settings menu. Then, go into device settings under the display submenu and check the box that optimizes the display for text. It makes reading mode an enjoyable experience rather than a gimmick.With those tweaks, the display is so good, I actually prefer the GN8 to the N7.2 when it comes to reading Flipbook and PDFs\u2026 but I\u2019ll still be using my Kobo Glo for long periods of reading e-books.For gamers, the GN8 may not have the pixel saturation of the N7.2\u2019s tremendous display, but it isn\u2019t lacking. About as heavy into gaming as I get is Bard\u2019s Tale, and it looks and plays great on the GN8 with the high-definition graphics pack. More intense games will make the GN8 stutter a bit, as its graphics processor is a bit dated. However, you\u2019re not going to be interested in the GN8 if you\u2019re only looking to browse the internet, play games and stream movies: this is not your recreational user\u2019s tablet.There\u2019s also a price to be paid for the N7.2\u2019s cutting edge technology: glitches. Google it.In addition to an enjoyable reading experience, the GN8 has something the N7.2 should: physical buttons that eliminate the need of assigning precious screen real-estate to navigation icons. These physical keys located away from the screen make the actual display area of the GN8 about 20% larger than the N7.2 with its virtual keys that take up a significant chunk of room on the display. Samsung, like Apple, gets why people instinctually enjoy having a dedicated home button: it makes life easier, even if some technophiles consider them the cumbersome tools of luddites. The dedicated keys make a lot of sense on the GN8: if you\u2019re interested in a device that has been designed around a stylus, you appreciate the touch-feely attributes of the entire Galaxy line\u2019s design.That stylus is a major benefit for people like me: content publishers that need to be able to import, edit and publish multimedia from remote locations. While sketching is great for fun or to make mind maps of projects, the S-Pen isn\u2019t just about Paper Artist. I\u2019ve found very good uses for the S-Pen when paired with the GN8\u2019s impressive hardware.The S-Pen is a great device, and I understand why people justify the expense of the GN8 with the statement \u201cit\u2019s all about the S-Pen\u201d after using the N7.2 with an aftermarket device. The S-Pen is a bit too thin for me to use for long periods, but I actually prefer navigating around the home screen and most applications with the S-Pen instead of my finger, especially Photoshop Touch (more on that later).This isn\u2019t a major problem because the Note is designed to take\u2026 notes. The S-Pen integrates well when digesting information-heavy PDFs, allowing the user to highlight section of text, make notes and quickly integrate and organize them within S-Note.Making the process even more efficient is MultiWindow. The MultiWindow feature is one of the advantages unique to the Note line that Samsung has made better than in the last generation with smoother control and more available applications that support it. Of course, I would like to see even more applications support it because everyone uses multiple windows on their bigger computers, so everyone knows how much of a productivity advantage the capability is. It\u2019s a no-brainer application designers need to integrate into their apps.When a beautiful display optimized for reading and highly integrated to the S-Pen input and interface, then empowered with MultiWindow and gestures like swiping the screen with the flat of the hand to take a full screen shot (or circling text and images with the S-Pen\u2019s button depressed to capture smaller items), I have a hard time believing that any other device could be better for the task of heavy research and study. The GN8 is the honors graduate student\u2019s wet dream.And there\u2019s good news for GN8 users after grad school. To schedule life, S-Planner almost became what I use to work with my Google calendars. It\u2019s a fluid and seamless way to do almost everything I need to do with my schedules, but it has one glaring fault because instead of being its own application, S-Planner is not much more than Google Calendar with S-Pen support and a new skin. Unfortunately, S-Planner has all the limitations of Google Calendar when it comes to scheduling.Instead, I\u2019m using another pre-loaded GN8 application for most of my scheduling needs: Awesome Note HD (though I still prefer the endless scrolling agenda list of Business Calendar\u2019s widget, found here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=netgenius.bizcal&hl;=en). Awesome Note HD, like the now-dead Astrid, allows me to set repeating events by the days that need to elapse. Granted, this is a feature I use to do things like remind myself to change the house\u2019s HVAC filter, replace the head on my electric toothbrush and give my lovely dog her heartworm and tick medications. While pedestrian, all of those tasks are dependent on the amount of days lapsed and important to me.Note to Samsung: form a partnership with Awesome Note by folding S-Planner and S-Note into a Note-tablet specific version of their application.The GN8 is loaded with a 4,600mAH battery that keeps me moving and producing in the field for my entire day. In the week I\u2019ve had it, I have never have to recharge the GN8 before bedtime, and I\u2019m not a light user.This is my GN8\u2019s typical day: I start out by sending and responding to emails in the morning for about an hour during my commute, generally using a folding Bluetooth keyboard or Google\u2019s voice recognition input through a Bluetooth headset. Once I get to where I\u2019m going my day is spent capturing and creating content, editing content between meetings and giving presentations at my client\u2019s offices. On my way home, I participate in social networking, play video games or try to get ahead on media projects that are either rushed, delayed or personal. After my commute, I\u2019ll use the GN8 to manage shopping and errand lists on my way home, and once I get home I use the integrated Peel application to control my television and DirectTV!Speaking of the IR blaster, it won\u2019t allow you to \u201cbump\u201d files and contacts to other devices like the N7.2\u2019s NFC feature. Some have listed this as a detriment, but NFC isn\u2019t going to be used in the environment that the GN8 is designed to excel in. Professionals may bump contacts with their phones, but I\u2019ve never seen anyone do it with their tablet\u2026 and I\u2019ve seen A LOT of people use A LOT of tablets.However, with the IR blaster found on the GN8 (and not the N7.2), it is a tremendous asset to be able to control monitors and most other devices with the same device you\u2019re running a presentation from. With ChromeCast and the IR blaster found in the GN8, I\u2019m ready to rock a presentation in most modern offices within a minute\u2026 and that makes a great impression when dealing with prospective clients that don\u2019t have a lot of time to waste.That\u2019s not to say NFC isn\u2019t good technology. It\u2019s great on a phone, but I\u2019m not going to dig out my tablet every time I want to purchase a latte and apple fritter\u2026The Samsung Galaxy Note 8 is a \u201cforce multiplier\u201d for media professionals because you buy a whole lot of bangs with the same buck. When the ability to set up and control presentation equipment in seconds instead of minutes (or even hours with older stuff) is combined with a massive fuel tank that supports a full work day of use without a recharge, outstanding performance, high-speed connectivity, better productivity, a wonderful display, light weight and a slick design, the GN8 becomes more than a really cool tablet. The GN8 does most of what any mobile professional needs it to do for as long as they need it to do it while saving weight, money, time and, with the S-Pen, it also saves my clients from the indignity of signing my invoices with their finger.THE BONUS EDITION:This is what you spend the $25 Google Play credit on if you want to get the most out of the GN8\u2019s unique features that make this tablet the best small Android tablet on the market:The S-Pen and Adobe\u2019s $10 \u201climited\u201d port of Photoshop [...] go together like peanut butter and jelly. I know that there are capable applications out there like Snapseed that will allow most people to do almost everything they need to make their photos pop for Facebook and Pinterest. But I\u2019m not blogging about food trucks or touching up selfies: I do stuff with images, video and sound for a living. If I can have Photoshop and do the high quality creating and editing on the go, I\u2019m buying it\u2026 and honestly, it\u2019ll do at least 95% of what I need it to do, so when compared to the exponentially more expensive desktop application, Photoshop Touch is one of the century\u2019s best deals.In addition to that, a $4.99 license for Clesh [...] gives me the ability to edit videos on the go. It works well for most of my needs, though some more complicated projects still require my sedentary equipment because I don\u2019t have much patience. I wouldn\u2019t recommend Clesh for a smartphone, but on larger displays and the extremely fast WiFi radio built into the GN8, Clesh is a wonderful application that makes the most of the GN8\u2019s hardware and S-Pen.To round it all out, Audio Evolution Mobile is available for $6.99 [...] and allows me to connect my ZOOM audio recorder to the GN8 via an inexpensive OTG USB adapter. It captures much better audio than the microphones mounted on the GN8, and it allows me to capture, edit and package complete audio tracks while working from my couch or on the long Metro ride home. The S-Pen makes grabbing and piecing together tracks one of the easiest experiences I\u2019ve had, and I have complete control over the entire capture process when doing podcasts outside my normal studio.Compared to the desktop interface, I prefer to edit my audio on the GN8 for a few reasons. First is the S-Pen interface because it makes clicking and scrolling and dragging so much more fluid than the mouse. The second reason has to do with quality. I can listen to it through my car\u2019s audio jack or Bluetooth, through wired headphones, Bluetooth stereo and Bluetooth mono headsets. This allows me to make sure it sounds okay across all formats my audience is likely to use without having to suffer the indignity of Microsoft\u2019s Bluetooth client.Since I have an OTG cable, I need an app that will help me bring files to the GN8 from its native location, and that\u2019s the excellent Nexus Media Importer available at the Play Market for $3.99 [...]. If I don\u2019t have to hassle with swapping MicroSD, I don\u2019t hassle with swapping MicroSD cards, and I\u2019ve already paid myself back a few times with the amount of time and frustration this application saves me.To get all those files organized and uploaded to where they need to go, I use the Total Commander file manager [...] and the FTP Plugin for Total Commander [...]. Both are available for free at the Android Market and are the best applications I\u2019ve used for my needs.For those not keeping track, the above applications cost a total of $25.96 and make the GN8 one of the best editing platforms I\u2019ve ever used. So far, I haven\u2019t witnessed the 1.6GHz quad-core Exynos processor struggle with the demands of editing or creating professional-level multimedia content. Even if it is slower than a high-quality desktop, I save more time with the S-Pen than I\u2019ve wasted on rendering.If I need to access a more powerful system, Samsung and Dropbox have teamed up to give GN8 purchasers a free 50GB upgrade. The WiFi radio that comes with the GN8 is one of the fastest I\u2019ve used, and I\u2019ve moved large files over both public and private hotspots in about the same amount of time my laptop takes. Granted, this is a snail\u2019s pace when compared to a direct line into a cable network, but for WiFi performance, the GN8\u2019s performance impresses.Also, the GN8 has one of the best GPS radios I\u2019ve used on ANY device! Navigating with GN8 and Google Now takes about 15 seconds less than trying to do the same thing through the dedicated navigation systems I\u2019ve used in most cars! It is truly amazing how much work Samsung put into getting the GN8 to work well before releasing it to market.You can\u2019t say the same thing about the N7.2. Google it.Combined with Splashtop, all I have to do is upload the media to my Dropbox account, log into the app, wait for my desktop to pop up and tell my hard-core unit at home what to do. While I\u2019m meeting with clients, doing work or commuting, my bigger projects are rendering on their own. I can log back in to Splashtop to check the progress of the project from anywhere in the United States, and when it\u2019s done I can use Splashtop to send it back to DropBox and have my client preview it.TECHNO-TANGENT WARNING: Even though it\u2019s more difficult to set up, I prefer the older Splashtop Remote Desktop HD on sale for $8.99 because I can use it any time I want on any network I want without having to \u201crent\u201d it by the month.

I currently also own an iPad 3, and an Iphone 4s.

I never thought that I would switch to an Android device, I have always owned apple products. All my computers are Macs.

I can't recommend it enough.", "Date": "June 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nexus 7 2 vs Tab 3 8.0 vs Note 8.0!", "Author": "taka13", "ReviewID": "RGA1PFDQUNN0Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My OG 10.1\" Asus Transformer TF101 was showing its age, and so it was time for a replacement.  I was looking for a more portable tablet that I could take to school or anywhere without the bulk.  After reading reviews and testing store demos, I narrowed it down to the Nexus 7 2013, Tab 3 8.0, and Note 8.0.  I'm no fanboy to any OS, but the iPad mini was never in the equation simply because I was in the market for Android not iOS.  The decision was tough, but for my needs the Note 8.0 edges them out.With all the Nexus 7 2013's great price and high specs, I just couldn't get past the screen size.  The high resolution display has sharp text, but a tad too small for my liking on full web pages and PDF's.  In landscape mode text was comfortable, but viewing height felt narrow.  Coming from rarely having to zoom on a 10\" screen wasn't helping either.  Even though the Nexus 7 is fast, sleek, and updates quickly I wasn't willing to give up 3\" of screen.So all that remained was the Samsung Tab 3 8.0 and Note 8.0.  After comparing these further I decided to take the plunge on the pricier Note 8.0 for the increased horsepower and S-pen stylus.  Overall I am very happy with it, despite my few gripes with it.  Transitioning from 10\" to 8\" was painless and found that I wasn't missing the larger screen at all.  The display is surprisingly vibrant and crisp considering it's not an Amoled or IPS tier screen.  Like others mentioned 8\" is the way to go for mobility, weight, comfort, while retaining a sizeable screen.  Text size is better than the Nexus 7 in full web pages and PDF's requiring little to no zooming.  I don't use the Wacom stylus as much as I thought, but it's amazingly handy when you need it.  Performance is snappy and tackles everyday tasks to moderately intensive gaming with ease.The only gripes I have, which I've learned to accept, are with Touchwiz, home buttons, and battery life.  Samsung's interface is bloated and looks a little cartoonish to me.  Without rooting I disabled the Samsung apps and features I didn't use, and added a launcher like Nova with minimalist icons for a better look and feel.  Occasionally mine will freeze for a second and then keep going like nothing happened, which I blame on Touchwiz.  It doesn't bother me much since it doesn't occur often, plus it's still ten times better than my old tablet.  Handling the tablet in landscape took some getting used to since it's easy to hit the back and menu buttons on accident, but one benefit is that it doesn't take up any screen.  Also battery life is acceptable not great; with moderate use, some tweaking, and its superior standby, it will get you easily over a day.  Hopefully the 4.2 update will help the battery and performance like it did on the 3G/LTE variant.Although the Tab 3 8.0 performs well in its own right in my opinion the only reason to get one is if you financially cannot or do not want to spend the difference for the Note 8.0.  Even still with Amazon's pricing and $25 Google credit (till 9/30), that brings it down to about a $50 difference, plus you get a faster processor, more ram, and s-pen features.If Google made a Nexus 8, I probably wouldn't be writing this review; however until then Samsung stands alone in the 8\" Android category, not including cheap tablets.In the end all three are great tablets, but the 8\" screen, S-pen, and performance on the Note 8.0 fit my needs the best.", "Date": "August 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent tablet for those who have use for the stylus", "Author": "Anonymous", "ReviewID": "R15FH7UA21UV9P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me start off by saying that I did not buy this tablet at Amazon. Having said that, after using it for about a week, it has proved to be an excellent tablet and comes with features that you don't find in the competition.Most people who have an issue with this tablet are concerned about the price. While that concern is legitimate, it is misguided due to the fact that it compares this tablet to the iPad mini. To start, the iPad Mini is exactly the iPad 2, except with a smaller display, which makes it two year old technology. It is powered by an anemic (by today's standards) dual-core 1 Ghz A5 CPU and a paltry 512 MB of RAM. By contrast, the Note 8.0 is powered by a quad-core 1.6 Ghz CPU and 2 GB of RAM. It is not the fastest CPU currently out there, but it is miles ahead of the A5. I am fairly on top of current technology, and I can't think of a single tablet in any form factor that has more powerful hardware. Absolutely not the iPad Mini or the iPad 4. And the obvious difference is that the Note 8 has a pen-capable display, which is not found on any competing 8\" tablet. Now, I am not trying to claim that either the iPad mini or the Note 8 are overpriced/underpriced because I simply don't know, but I am trying to point out why the higher price of the Note 8 is justified.The other issues that people seem to have with this device is the plastic housing and the screen resolution. While it would certainly be nice to have full 1080p, I can say that the screen on this tablet is excellent. I would not consider the screen resolution to be a drawback in this device. To give you a comparison, the 13.3\" display in my MacBook Pro has the exact same resolution as the 8\" display in the Note 8. It is very sharp. As far as the plastic vs aluminum housing goes, let's put it this way; every iPad or iPhone I've seen in use was shrouded in a thick layer of plastic, rubber, or leather, and chances are good that you'll be buying a case for this tablet as well. The housing should make no difference to most people, and arguably plastic is more durable. You drop a metal tablet, you'll either dent it or bend it. It's permanent damage. You drop a plastic tablet and it may just absorb the impact better, w/o significant cosmetic defects.As far as my experiences with it go, I have had absolutely no problems. The tablet is very fast and fluid, screen is plenty bright to even use in direct sunlight, and battery life is adequate. I can't give specific details on battery life yet, but from what I can tell so far, I should be able to get around 8 hours of screen time and maybe more. It of course depends on a lot of things. Browsing for example will use more battery than reading an ebook, likewise watching videos will use more battery. The biggest battery drain is the screen, so if you are using it at max brightness, expect significant battery drain. That goes for any tablet.So, should you buy this tablet over the iPad mini or the Nexus 7. Well, they are both cheaper, and if you are already invested in the Apple ecosystem, it may make more sense for you to go for the iPad. The Nexus 7 is very cheap by comparison, and rightfully so. Despite being powered by a quad-core CPU, the Tegra 3 is not anywhere near the speed of the Exynos chip in this device. You can look at benchmarks online if you want, but I have another tablet with the Tegra 3, and the Exynos CPU in the Note 8 blows it away, benchmarking nearly twice as fast. And you can really tell the difference in regular use. Of course the Nexus 7 is also a 7\" tablet. The only way I'd recommend the Nexus 7 over the iPad mini or the Note 8 is if you're going strictly by price. Otherwise, you really have to decide whether or not you need the stylus. If all you want is to watch movies, read news, and play games, you have no use for the stylus. If you need note-taking capability or precision touch capability, this is the tablet to get. The Wacom stylus is not simply a finger replacement, it is a precision tool for handwriting, drawing, or designing, and it works extremely well.", "Date": "April 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "The APPS You Need and Why My Desktop is Dusty", "Author": "LuckyAL", "ReviewID": "R1B4STG3UIFZUP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This highlights some of the Apps that are \"NEED TO HAVES\" if you make the wise choice of buying this tablet.  With the Note 8 and these Apps, I haven't used my Desktop since.NEED TO HAVE Apps for the Samsung Galaxy Note 8mazec3**This App replaces your keyboard and enables you to hand write in every App, email and on the internet using the S/Pen.  Most people have difficulty reading my hand writing and yet this App is able to consistently convert it into text. I find that hand writing with mazec3 on the Note 8 is noticeably faster than tapping or swipping on a keyboard.  With this App and the Note 8, you'll get more done than you could on any other tablet.**It is worth noting that the Samsung keyboard does have a native handwriting recognition mode built in (you can find it in the keyboard's settings).  However, instead of writing continuously, you can only input a couple words at a time.  It's reliable - but it will slow you down.Polaris OfficeThis App comes pre loaded on the Note 8 but I am highlighting it to urge you to use it...because it is so amazing.  I have tried several Apps to create and edit Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents-nothing comes close to Polaris Office.  It is extremely easy to use and the editing tools closely mirror the Office Desktop Software.  So far, I haven't found anything that I used to do on my desktop that I haven't been able to do with Polaris Office.  In fact, when combined with mazec3, I prefer Polaris Office to the desktop.G CloudThis App backs up all of your files including documents, music, contacts etc... Just install it on all your devices - including your old tablet, then back-up all your files and you can easily download any of the files on the Note 8. I also use Drop Box, but the reason I love this App is because I can easily get my music from my past and present devices onto my Note 8 and my documents are backed up daily so I can't lose anything.mSecureThis App stores all your passwords and log in information.  What makes this App stand out from the pack (and will save you time) is that from mSecure in a click or two you can instantly login to your favorite Websites-without having to open your browser, type in the URL, and type in your login info... mSecure does all the work for you.  I also used to use the same 2-3 passwords over and over.  With mSecure, I now have unique passwords for all my logins using their password generator.  I no longer use my desktop to login to online banking or web applications... it's faster and easier on the Note 8.I hope this gives you a better idea of what is possible with the Note 8.

I tried the small first and it seemed to be okay, but I thought maybe I would like a bigger screen, so I returned the small one and got the bigger one. After a couple of weeks, I realized just how limited I was using that device and found myself using my phone more for browsing, playing games, etc. Plus, I like to put movies on mine to watch when I'm bored at work. I had a hard time getting videos on the kindle. It would tell me it was in the wrong format, when It wasn't. Anyway, I returned both of those and went for the Samsung note 8. I already had the Samsung galaxy 3 for my phone, so I knew that I would know my way around it. I have had it for a couple of months now and I love it. I use the stylus all the time because it really is intuitive when it comes to figuring out what you've written. Let me tell, I have horrible hand writing too. I love the split screen and have used it multiple times. The only thing I wish is that there were more options for the split screen. Like opening 2 of my favorite apps at the same time. Only certain apps will work with the split screen and most of those are the ones Samsung put on the tablet. The Samsung calendar is fantastic and the size is perfect for me. I realized when I bought the larger kindle that I had made a mistake because it didn't fit into most of my purses. The note 8 is big enough to be very functional for me, but small enough that it's very portable.

Due to (and some provided by) my job, I have an ipod, ipad, a windows laptop, a macbook pro, and only recently I've gotten into android products, and I have to say that I love the openness of android.First of all, when I got the note 8.0, I have to say I both loved and mostly hated it; hated it because of all the bloatware and useless (to me) apps that Samsung puts on the tablet; I loved it because of the wacom pen, which is very precise. Moreover, you can use ANY wacom tablet pen with the tablet, not just the small pen that comes with the note. I use a very nice wacom pen from an old Fujitsu tablet pc. I have the Wacom \"Penabled Tablet Pc Eraser Pen\" which is nice as well and is large almost like a regular pencil. The pen can easily be used to take notes in class, especially with LectureNotes (which I used on a daily basis).To get rid of the bloatware, you can get an app called Clean Master from the android app store and if you open it up and go to app manager, you can disable (not uninstall) all the useless preinstalled apps (there is a category that says \"completely safe to disable apps\" and you just disable them, one after another). Of course, you can also go to app manager and do the same, but Clean Master makes it so easy. This is OK and it left a fairly nice tablet without a lot of the bloatware.However, I ended up voiding the warranty because I rooted the note 8.0, then I installed a custom recovery (Philz touch), then I installed cyanogenmod 11. Now I have to say that I absolutely love the note 8.0; it's my favorite computer. The wacom pen works perfectly, and the tablet is 100% pure with no traces of bloatware whatsoever and it runs smooth as silk. (The original Samsang had over 50% of the ram being used even without installed apps running, while with cyanogenmod 11, only 17% is used.)I would have never written this review, except that I did install the custom ROM (cyanogenmod 11) and the Samsung works like the dream tablet I've always wanted.

Smith", "ReviewID": "R3TT4IS4I51GZP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I would consider myself a techy and have owned many devices; ipad (3rd gen), ipod touch, nexus s, galaxy nexus, galaxy tab 8.9, nexus 7, galaxy note 2 and now my galaxy note 8.SIZE FACTOR (I wear a large sized glove)I think the Note 8 has finally found the size sweet spot. The Note 8 is comfortable to hold in the portrait and landscape position. I found the galaxy 8.9 and especially the iPad to be awkward and cumbersome to hold. In the landscape position I found it difficult to cover the entire space of the iPad and tab 8.9. I did like the size of the nexus 7 but chose to sell mine on Glyde to upgrade to the note 8. The Note 8 feels very comfortable to hold despite it being plastic. I do not have a problem with plastic phones or tablets because I always put a screen cover and case on my devices to protect them.SOFTWAREI was not a fan of Samsung's earlier renditions of its Touchwiz interface on my galaxy tab (8.9). In fact, I still think that stock android is ideal but I just install the nova launcher app (see link below) and run that on top of Touchwiz which is the main reason to go with an android device, customization! I had toiled with the idea of purchasing the Note 8 because I thought it was overpriced. So after a trip to BB, I tried to force myself to get an iPad mini but still felt like I was using the same operating system I had on my iPod touch from 4 years ago. Apple might get better apps at first but they all migrate to Android eventually and Android has so many customization apps available it is hard to get bored. Apples control issues will be its undoing imo, and have severely limited what these devices are capable of doing. Does Samsung copy Apple? I think they do copy some aspects of Apple like the messaging app and touch keyboards looks eerily similar and the presence of a home button. I think Apple makes superior looking devices but Samsung and Android have superior software.DISPLAYThis is another reason I chose the Note 8 instead of the iPad mini which I also think is the perfect size. I strongly considered waiting for a retina display to come out for the iPad mini but could not justify moving backwards to an iOS device. Also after I put a iPad retnia display next to the iPad mini I did not notice enough of a difference to justify the added bulk and expense that comes with the retina display. The display on the Note 8 is absolutely gorgeous! It is one of the most vibrant screens I have ever seen.MISCThe s pen is an added bonus but the addition of an micro sd card slot that is not hidden inside the device is another reason not to overlook the Note 8. Both of these options make photo editing easier in my opinion. I have a micro sd card adapter in my camera and all I have to do is pop it in the Note 8 and photos are loaded into the gallery. The s pen is cool but I have not had enough time with the device to review its effectiveness. The multiscreen ability of the Note 8 is one of its better features. It has a limited amount of apps that function with the multi screen ability but all of the main ones like chrome browser, facebook, maps and all of the samsung apps function.  I purchased the device at BB and made sure they price matched the Amazon price.CONCLUSIONI can honestly say that I am completely happy with my purchase and despite the high price of the Note 8 I feel that I did not want to compromise with my tablet.  The Galaxy Note 8 is by far the best tablet/phone I have owned so far.https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.launcher.prime&hl;=en", "Date": "May 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great tablet ...but", "Author": "ALAIN RIZKALLAH", "ReviewID": "R9AJII6G9ZTZY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So basically this tablet got a lot of reviews, and I'm sure all of you have read everything about its magnificent features specially the S Pen, so i'm sure i'm not gonna add much so I'll keep it as short as possible.

The only negative thing I can say about it, is its inability to deal well with large pdf files. I think this is a  problem for android in general, and this is one of the areas where apple is still superior. Opening and skimming through large pdf books on apple devices, for example an ipad mini ,is much more fluid and you don't have to wait for pages to load even when the processor is actually weaker on paper than samsung's processor. I frequently use this tablet for reading and for the most part it does the job but recently I got a large book (around 220 MB) and the device had major problems with it. I tried several ebook  readers to open it and I noticed variable performances between them but none was perfect. The best reader which gave me a very fluid performance comparable to the one I saw when I opened the pdf on an ipad mini was the kindle application, I was happy but again the kindle doesnt have all the options provided by my favourite readers.As a summary, I highly recommend this tablet, it is superior to apple in most aspects except for the one I just mentioned, so I think the manufacturers should work on that.", "Date": "July 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "By far my best tablet to date", "Author": "Jen", "ReviewID": "R382FJF13OQ4F8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let me start with what bugs me, which isn't much with this tablet.The placement of the home keys... This is just something I'm going to have to get used to. It's nice that Samsung created fixed home keys vs using the android screen home keys. Only there at the very bottom. Every time I'm holding in portrait mode my thumbs keep hitting the return and settings key. Trying to hold it avoiding those keys feels awkward. I don't have tiny hands so this is going to take some getting used to. Also, when it's in landscape mode I forget the home keys are fixed and have to get used to using them with my left hand or right (depending on what orientation I have it). For people who have never owned an tablet before they wont know the difference. For seasoned users, this will take some retraining.The camera is fine in portrait mode, but landscape it a bit awkward as well.Aside from those two issues, I'm totally in love with my Note 8. I'm just going to list the thing I love, since there are many detailed reviews already on this.Size: I've owned 10.1 and 7.0. This is a happy medium for me. I love my 7.0 but the extra inch is nice. Although I would have been happy with it at 7.0 as well. It fits in my purse well and doesn't weigh it down too much. My 10.1 inch always felt heavy in my bag.Multi-screen: Very cool feature. You can easily view multiple windows at the same time.Stylus: Never used one before and this is really cool. It's like using a pen on your tablet. Real easy to use. Only draw back is the home key the tablet is too hard to use with stylus, so I have to press it with my finger. Not a big deal for me though.Built-in apps: This tablet is designed for readers, note takers, web browsing and so, so much more. Samsung's built-in apps are really great. I've only had the tablet for less than week so I haven't had time to play with everything. However I from what I've used it's great for journaling and note taking. One of the main reasons why I wanted this tablet so I wouldn't have to buy anymore paper journals and do all my journaling on my tablet. Of course other tablets can take notes as well. It's just different with they stylus and the apps Samsung has provided.Micro SD: 64GB, that's all I'm saying. I've added on and it reads perfect. Yes, this tablet comes with free 50GB of space with Drop Box, but that's only for year. And what do you do when you want to access a file (pics or music) when you're offline? The added 64GB leaves me so much space to add my pics and music I'm set. My only wish is that Samsung/Google allowed for apps to be stored on the card as well. As with older version of Android used to do.Camera: Front and rear are great. Only when in landscape mode the home keys kinda get in the way. Again just some retraining for people who are used to having the home keys in the screen.Display: Love it. Took this to the beach. I had to have the brighten on the highest, but I was able to see it perfect. The reading feature is great too. Much easier on the eyes.Extra home screen: Every time you plug in your headphones or pull out your stylus you get a customized home screen that you can adjust how ever you want. So for example the stylus home screen has apps for notes and the headphone screen has apps for music and videos. With each screen you're able to add additional apps or remove them.There's so much more this tablet can do I can go on and on. The price is a bit too high. I can see it at even $50-$75 dollars less.

This was an afterthought to an ongoing adventure with the to-date miserable Dell Venue Pro 8 stylus*.  The Note 8 will update itself to Android 4.2.2, which is good news.  And although it appears only the 16GB version is out there now (at least in Wifi only) you do have the option to install apps to the MicroSD card.  The 8\" form factor is, in my opinion, a better size for note taking with the pen than a 10\" or 12\" tablet, although they are likely preferred for those with artistic tendencies.  This will be a productivity tablet for me.  Using Papyrus and the included S-note, I am very happy with this device.  It is a touch tablet until you need the pen, and a pen tablet when you want to take a note.The limitations of no native pen support in either Evernote or Onenote is disappointing, but not a show stopper for me.  Several pen apps will export or sync to Evernote, although so far I have found that integration is not as tight as you might hope.  But, Samsung did a very, very good job of the pen implementation here and if you are going to look to the tablet more than you look for what the tablet sends to your laptop, this is your device.The screen resolution spec is on the low side, but it is not noticeable.  I have found that in these 7-8 inch tablets, high end resolution specs may be overkill at least in everyday productivity tasks.  Comparing an iPad Retina, Venue Pro 8, and Nexus 7 2013 the only practical difference I see is screen brightness, rather than resolution.  Basically, I can illuminate a large room with the Dell or Nexus, but all are acceptable in normal usage.  Outdoors, you will favor the Dell or the Nexus.  So basically no complaints about the screen at all but I wouldn't mind a brighter one.So my conclusion here, if you need a pen-input productivity tablet and are happy keeping most of the information \"on tablet\" don't hesitate.  If you need Onenote with pen input, go look at the Asus Vivotab and the Windows world, or anticipate the hoped for \"Surface Mini\" later in 2014.-------------------------*Update on Dell Venue Pro 8.  Dell, without any request from me, send me a new revision active stylus.  Bravo Dell. The new version seems very usable with onenote, although it is a step down from the s-pen as expected.

He \"Cryora\"", "ReviewID": "R32GDBRUKHDIKX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's probably the one of the smallest tablets out there that has a Wacom digitizer.  I personally felt like I should have gotten one with a larger screen (like the Note 10.1), since I'm physics student.  The writing is not as precise as pencil on paper, nor as fast (it has a small but noticeably latency).  My best analogy would be that the precision is somewhere between a sharpy and a ball pen.  Still, it allows me to save paper.  If you want a tablet for drawing, you might want something larger too, unless it's just for fun.Still, I reckon the small size of the tablet has its perks.  Its battery size is half that of the 10.1, and the battery life is only a few hours shorter.  So while it might not last you as long on a full charge, it takes less time to charge it.  Usually an hour or two is enough to get the Note 8 from almost 0% to 100% battery life.  You get more battery life per hour spent charging it compared to larger, battery hungry tablets.For the purposes of keeping memos, however, it's pretty awesome.  Everything is digital, so you don't have to worry about having a mess of disorganized flash cards or post-its around your desk.  Cutting and pasting is not that smooth, but possible.The Android OS is iffy.  While it's a nice combat OS that allows widget customization and multiple pages for your home screen, it lacks the same productivity as a Windows (especially if you're used to Windows).  You'll probably have to go out of your way to find apps that allow you to convert one file type to another.  Some apps won't even allow you options to open from, or save to a directory, but rather require you to \"share\" it via Google Drive or some other method.  Organizing files is certainly less efficient because of this.  You'll also have to go out of your way to find apps (sometimes pay for apps) to allow the same functionality that you can get for free on Windows, like writing programs in C++, and the capabilities will still be limited (console applications).  It does come with Polaris Office, which allows you to create document, spreadsheet, and presentation files, albeit with derpy compatibility with MS Office.  Sometimes symbols come out wrong, or the formatting is not conserved.The tablet screen, imo, is large enough to view full web pages (as opposed to mobile versions of the same pages), since it does have pretty good resolution.  Plus you can always zoom in if things are hard to see).  However, you'll have to go out of your way to make Youtube videos work on Desktop mode.For the Note 8 - No support for Java.  No gyroscope.  No flash (for taking pictures).  :(The back camera protrudes out from the back surface.  Solution - get a case.The IR blaster sucks (my TV won't detect it).The GPS is hard to use (Google Maps requires online connectivity, so either save an area of your map for offline use, or get an SMS version of the Tablet).  There are navigation apps, but the free open source ones have missing streets, while the more complete ones will cost you.  I've personally stuck to using a dedicated GPS device.There is a slot for micro-SD card.  You can also buy an on-the-go device to connect the micro-USB port (same port for charging) of this tablet to a USB flash drive, or SD card.  :)The bottom line is it's a great tablet for the price.  It does everything that any other Android tablet does (with the exception of serious gaming) and has an S-pen.  The screen size may not be ideal for doing math problems or more advanced art projects, but it gets the job done.  A lot of the neat features (Java, Gyro, Camera Flash) aren't present, but the tablet is compact and has a quick battery charge time (though not necessarily life, but enough to last you about a day per charge).  It does give you the Office capabilities, but specifically for spreadsheets, I much prefer working on Excel on a laptop or computer with a mouse (and a larger screen).", "Date": "April 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love this thing!

I then experienced some buyer's remorse after I saw the Note.  I waffled back and forth because it seemed self indulgent to purchase another tablet so soon.  Then I caught a good deal on a Black Friday promotion and took the plunge.  I am so glad I did.The S-Pen really is worth it.  I tried after market styluses with both my Tab and my Ipad and they didn't have the precision (these devices also lack the digital layer that enables the S-Pen to function).  My work requires that I read and mark up PDF documents on a frequent basis.  Being able to do this with the S-Pen turns a chore into something resembling a pleasure.  The S-Pen is very accurate and my notes are legible.Other improvements over the tab are a slimmer profile device, a MUCH longer battery life, and a better screen.  It is fast enough for my needs.  I also appreciate the expansion slot so memory can be added economically.  The big apple gouges a bit for extra memory, IMOIf I were looking for a tablet for fun and leisure, I'd go for an ipad because of the more intuitive operating system and the greater array of apps, and for streaming digital content.  However, if you want to use a tablet for work as well as play, I don't think you can beat the Samsung Note series of tablets.  The multi-screen capability (while limited) is another big plus.

(I still have a \"dumb phone.\")  I was all set to get a Kindle Fire, thinking it was a good starter tablet, since all I really wanted to do was read books, do a little internet surfing, e-mail, and maybe watch a few videos.  I read enough negative reviews that it made me think twice, and after seeing the 8 inch screen size on the Samsung in a local electronics store (not too big, not too small, just right!), and playing with the stylus for drawing and note taking, I was sold, even though it was more than I planned on spending.  The designer in me was also attracted to the white bezel and slim, lightweight design.I love the home button on the front, the menu button to the left of it that brings up whatever menu goes with the application you have running in front, as well as the return arrow that takes you back to where you were (very helpful for someone like me used to windows). Learning my way around the features was a lot easier and more intuitive than I expected, it's enough like Windows that I think I've figured most of it out in a much shorter period of time that I thought I would.I'm also using it for things I never expected I would like or need, things like opening e-mailed faxes I work off of every day, rather than printing them out, so this will eventually pay for itself in toner and paper saved.  One of the first applications I added was Kindle, and I've already downloaded a couple books, I'm actually reading more as a result because being able to enlarge the text makes it easier for my not so great vision.  I don't think it works within the Kindle app, but this tablet has some kind of reading feature that allows for adjusted backlighting and I think contrast with the text to make it easier.  Within the kindle app, though, I'm still able to dim it enough in the evening, for example, that it's not too much strain on the eyes.  For me it's fine, since I don't typically read for more than a half hour to an hour at a time, at most.Also LOVE the drawing and note taking feature, and I've sketched some designs in S-Note using different colors and pen/pencil/brush types.  No more scribbled notes, sketches and ideas getting away from me on my desk or the bottom of my purse.I still sometimes struggle to adjust to this screen size after being used to a 24 inch monitor, but I'm getting used to it and I'm so glad I bought this thing.

Combining technology of old with todays technological advancements offers a new valuable feature set that sets this tablet apart from the mainstream. With so many tablets offering virtually the same real world performace and feature set, when one comes out with a unique feature set it makes the decision of which to purchase much easier. As long as you know what that feature set has to offer you.PROS:The processor and memory allows you to breeze through menus and execute any operation to include any app currently available on the market without a hiccup. The screen is bright and clear with no notable differences side by side with my daughter's iPad Mini. Battery life is on par of all the others easily getting through a heavy days work without charge. However, these are not the features that should draw you toward this tablet as many have these same bragging rights at a smaller price. The precise control of the Wacom's 'S' pen technology is its defining feature. You can truly use this to replace pen and paper when taking notes during a lecture or meeting. Try the same thing with your finger or fat tipped touch capacitive stylus and you will quickly be back to a pen and paper after your notes end up looking worst than a 5 year old writing with a crayon. Refining pictures on photoshop is quicker than on a computer with a mouse and again offers the precision unmatched by any other (non-penabled) tablets. The same thing obviously holds true for artists or doodlers when using applications like Sketchbook plus adding the utility of pressure sensitivity for accurate shading without having to contstantly adjust through the menu. In addition to the 'S' pen, the IR sensor is more useful than I had imagined. I easily added all my TVs,  Bluray players, projector, receivers organized by room even my 15 year old Aiwa system. Granted the app could be a little better by adding easier access to more controls for each device but does well enough to bypass buying a $100+ Logitech remote.CONS:Samsung fanatics ardently back the use of plastic to encase their premium devices, but the look and feel simply does not match the quality exuded by Apple products or Asus's infinity tablets. Although I would love for Samsung to take note and offer a premium casing to match the rest of the device, adding a quality case easily remedies this minor complaint.OVERALL:Anyone who wants to use a tablet for everything from an powerful productivity tool at work or school to taking full advantage of art and photo apps should look no further than this or possibly a Note 10.1. Personally, I have found the 8.0 tablet as easily useful as 10 inchers with better form factor to use on the go, but those who plan on using it for more for graphical design might want the extra real estate at the cost of resolution. If you have no interest in jotting notes, utilizing photo or art apps then save money and get a Nexus 7 or one of the other countless counterparts with similar features, otherwise look no further as the price of Note 8.0 is easily justified", "Date": "July 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best 8\" Tablet For Artists", "Author": "Raniel Bambasi", "ReviewID": "R3A2PBJCZ2ITB7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So to start off, I do think that the $399 price tag is a bit much, which is why I'm giving it four stars, but besides that, this tablet is pretty darn great. I'm a painter/illustrator and while I wouldn't use this for anything official (unless it's my last resort), this does make for a great on-the-go digital sketchbook. The S-Pen is accurate enough that drawing on it is almost as accurate as writing with a physical pen and paper. There's still a tiny TINY bit of lag if you're used to Wacom tablets but it's probably not noticeable to most people, and out of all the Android tablets I've tried this has been THE most accurate. It won't replace a Wacom Cintiq but as I mentioned, is great for sketching, best coupled with Autodesk apps. The S-Note app is great but it's pretty limited as an actual drawing or painting program.Other features that can be useful for artists would be the Multi-Window feature. I haven't used it much as of now but I can see it becoming very useful when researching and note taking. Another one would be the aNote HD app. I wish they renamed it because it sounds like an amateur app but it's a great organizer. So if you're the type that has a lot of ideas, thoughts, notes and events that you need to document, this app would make things easier for you. It's pretty detailed as well, so you can make sure that all your entries are neatly organized and properly labeled in a fashionable manner. The S-Note has the same, though more S-Pen dependent features, and as far as I can remember, both the aNote and S-Note can work together, so that's handy.As far as drawbacks, I know it sounds odd but the system sounds are very limited. For example, the system sounds for pressing buttons, locking and unlocking are all water-drop themed. I'm not sure why Samsung had to pick such a specific sound instead of a sound that has mass appeal. You can't even change it to something else, you either have it on or off, which is a bummer if you want a more professional sounding tablet, but I digress. The screen does get smudged easier than say, a Nexus 7 but I guess that can be countered by buying a screen protector or having a handy tablet-friendly cloth wipe.Another drawback is that even though the system is marketed as 16gb, I only have 9gb of available memory. I've used less than a gig of memory so far and it's disappointing that the system is close to being full - by today's typical memory consumption standards. I know that companies always market devices at a certain amount only to find that a few gigs have been removed when you get the device, but 9gb from 16gb is a bit absurd. So just a warning, you should buy an SD card if you need more than that. You technically do get a 50gb Dropbox account - though it has yet to appear on my account, might have to activate it? - and have the ability to access your Google Drive, assuming you have one, which technically gives you around an extra 65gb if you're connected to the internet, but if you want memory on the go, I suggest just buying a memory card if you can.Overall I do love this device. I wish it was cheaper, but whatever. If you're an artist and looking for a good tablet to draw on, you can't really beat the Note 8.0. As far as I know, Wacom themselves provide the pressure sensitive technology so you're in good hands. I might trade it in or sell it when the REAL Wacom tablet comes out, but who knows when that will be. In the mean time, this will do the job.PS, If you're debating between the 10.1 and the 8.0 and size isn't an issue, I recommend the 8.0 because the 10.1's screen isn't as responsive compared to the 8.0. The only thing that can beat the 8.0 in the near future would be the upcoming Samsung ATIV tablets which also sports the S-Pen, but those are more closer to being computers than tablets. So basically if you like the 8\" size and would need the S-Pen functionality, it's worth the money.", "Date": "July 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "One thing to note about movies on this tablet...", "Author": "JTS", "ReviewID": "R2UMA5LOMBJ3DJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "From the beginning of my tablet search I was dead set on purchasing an iPad mini.  I have an iphone, an ipod classic, ipod touch and an ipod shuffle and have had good experiences with Apple products and didn't see any reason not to get an Apple tablet.  I didn't like the regular iPad due to size and weight so the mini was in my sights.  However, the one thing that held me back was the screen resolution of the iPad mini and the fact that Apple would likely release an improved mini 2 with better resolution and better processor.  I'm not saying that the current mini screen and processor is bad but knowing that it could be a lot better kept me from purchasing it.  So I decided to wait for the mini 2...and so I waited...and waited and then something interesting happened.  I decided to poke my foot outside of the Apple universe and see what other tablets were on the market and I came across some articles about the Samsung Note 8 and what intrigued me was the S pen.  This is my first tablet purchase and I wanted something that I could use for work in addition to home and the S pen seemed like a great feature.  I've always wanted to reduce all the paper clutter around my desk and having all my notes electronic was very appealing.  When I tried the Note 8 out at a local Best Buy, I was sold.  A lot of the key features and highlights have already been described in previous reviews so no need to repeat them here.  My primary use for the tablet is for note taking, productivity tasks, reading ebooks, and surfing the net (checking emails, news, stocks).  Occasionally, I would use it to play some games and watch movies to kill time if I was traveling.  After a couple of weeks of usage I can say that I am happy with my purchase with a drawback that, in my opinion, keeps this from being a 5 star tablet.The drawback is trying to get movies onto the Note 8 without having to shell out additional $$ to purchase the movie in the Google Play store.  I have numerous blu ray discs that come with a digital copy of the movie.  Therefore, I can't justify shelling out another $15 to buy the android version of the movie.  I have found in a lot of cases the blu ray digital copy can be accessed either through Ultraviolet streaming which can be done via a Flixster app or a copy can be downloaded to a phone or tablet IF you have iTunes.  Right off the bat, I know that I will not be able to copy a digital movie from iTunes to an Android tablet.  So there doesn't seem to be a way to get those digital movies onto the Note 8.  On the other hand it's a cinch to move them onto an Apple phone or tablet with iTunes.  So my next option was to see if I can stream the movie via Ultraviolet/Flixster, which is not my first choice because its a wi-fi only tablet.  The problem is Flixster will not allow you to stream Ultraviolet movies if you have a rooted device.  Which is all well and good if you don't root your device but if you don't root your device then you can't have Flash Player running when you browse the web.  In my opinion, Flash makes the web experience better and that's why my device is rooted.  To go through the process of unrooting, and then streaming and then re-rooting seems like an inconvenience. I have Amazon Prime so I tried to stream movies from Prime but to my dismay I could not find the Amazon Instant Video app in the Google Play store.  They have it for the iTunes App store but not for Android.  What???  At the end of the day, this drawback was enough to prevent me from giving this product a perfect score of 5 stars primarily because it seems like an iPad would have less roadblocks to overcome when compared to the Note 8 in order to copy or play movies.  Again, this is not to say that the Note 8 is a bad product, the S pen is terrific, the size is perfect, the speed is top notch...its just my experience thus far with trying to use it for movies has been less than great.", "Date": "May 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Disappointing in quality, features, battery, and service", "Author": "Alastair J.

The first problem that was apparent was actually getting the benefits that the tablet purports to come with such as the Google Play credit. It took me two weeks of back and forth with Samsung to get the credit applied to my google account. A problem, should you look at their facebook support page, seems to be very widely experienced. Disappointing but nonetheless handled and now out of the way. Reckoned it was time for me to enjoy my tablet.I love the screen, I think 8 inches is just the best size for reading coupled with an excellent screen. The ergonomics are great even wrapped in a case, good weight and an acceptable camera. The tablet is also quite good in power, I play Shadowgun (3D FPS) and it looks great and runs smooth.The S-Pen is pretty sweet and enjoyable as a method of input combined with the one-hand ergonomics of the tablet. Nice for scribbling, drawing, and text input. However, according to the adverts I assumed I could use the pen to cut out imagery from a variety of things, like Googlemaps for example, and pull it into an email or note-program and annotate it easily. Turns out this isn't the case at all. Most programs, including the note programs included in the note won't allow the s-pen cut-out images to be imported into them. aNote HD allows it somewhat, but image resolution is ridiculously grainy and illegible if it contains text. I've watched the instructive videos on youtube but they have not illuminated anything new that would allow this. Comments are completely welcome on this front.QUALITY PROBLEMS ARE KILLING THIS FOR MEHowever, within 1 month, and without any drops or rough handling of the tablet (I keep it in a case at all times), a hairline crack starting forming on the top bezel, just above the Samsung logo. I immediately contacted Samsung through their facebook support page but never received a response. Within another week the crack had stretched across the whole top bezel and another one appeared on the upper side of the power button on the side bezel. I again used the facebook page as well as the direct service support on Samsung's website. To this day I have not received any response to my problems. Not only is the build quality lacking on the tablet, but non-existent customer service has radically changed my perception of Samsung's products for the worse.Furthermore, I purchased the tablet as a computer substitute for graduate school and the Note 8.0's long battery life was one of the primary determinants for purchase. However, unlike the first several weeks of 11 hours, the battery life has dropped by hours and I'm lucky if I get 7 with moderate use and conservative power-settings. If I turn on the Wifi and surf, it may can drop another few hours. Moreover, the battery will often drop very rapidly and have had the tablet suddenly shutdown showing 0% life without any warning (Typically a warning pops at 15 & 5%). When the tablet is around 35% range, it can hit zero within 30 minutes. Charging is also showing irregularity, more than once I have left it to charge overnight, heard the affirmative charging sound, and wake to find it at 0% despite having been 30-40% when I plugged it in (Furthermore I turned it off while charging).Bizarre, and I would assume this tablet is clearly defective but I have so far failed to get anyone at Samsung to pay attention to me. I thought Samsung was the top of the heap in terms of Android products, especially for a tablet that's well-more expensive than its competition. Despite my disagreements with Apple's accessibility, I'm thinking perhaps the hardware and software quality trade-off may not be worth it.", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great tablet if its in the $200 range", "Author": "keo \"Get the best deal, then get disappointed...", "ReviewID": "R3AVTPQB5Z2CML", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is Excellent for the price.  I've owned one for close to a year, and its the perfect balance between a 5\" and 10\".  Most people won't be happy with the resolution of the screen, but I think its just fine especially for taking notes.  Speed is fine for browsing and writing, although at times it can have trouble with intense games. I've owned the new Note 10.1 2014 version, and the Note 2, and I actually enjoy the Note 8.0 much better (to each their own) than either of them.  Yes the 10.1 2014 version has a nicer screen and higher specs, but if you're using this tablet for Note taking or drawing, higher everything also meant draining the battery quickly.  I just shut off the Wi-fi, turn down the screen to 35-50%, and I'm set for hours in school. Also, although the new S-note has nice new shiny excellent features, there is obvious lag in the pen, and you can't use detailed erasing when drawing like the note 8.0.  In erase mode, once you touch the current piece you have written, the eraser will remove EVERYTHING.  There are no settings to remove this.  The Note 8.0 uses very detailed erasing, and writing is very smooth.For those that are wondering if the Note 8.0 is good for taking notes at school, I'd say yes.  I've used it through 3 hour classes no problem,  and its easy to write and erase things during class.  Once I hit 60-70%, I attach a portable battery to it and juice it back to 100%.  Place the tablet in landscape, and its easy to write.  Pinch to zoom for detailed writing and you can pan around the screen using the same two fingers while dragging them along to the spots you'd like to view (at times it feels like an old type writer when pulling the page back to the beginning of the next line).  Its great for kids to practice their ABC's, just be sure to properly protect it and keep an eye on the S-pen.S-note is decent, but I prefer using the app Lecture Notes.  It costs $5, but well worth the cost if you like to customize your note taking and download PDF's to write over.  I sometimes download Coloring Book PDF's for my niece to draw on and save myself from buying books and crayons.  Its also great when a professor emails PDF's for class because you can highlight important information.  I'd sometimes \"white out\" terms, study the content, then remove the \"white out\" portions to check if I was correct on the term.  Its and excellent tool.In the end, its all about personal preference.  I like the balance of an 8\" tablet, vs bigger or smaller versions.  I think I spent too much money at the time I purchased this gadget, but if the tablet is in the $200 range, I'd say its worth every penny.  Spend time with it, and you'll be very happy with this device.", "Date": "March 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "What's not to love other than the price", "Author": "busymomPA", "ReviewID": "R2OR8NET9YJIRN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me preface my comments by letting you know, we have both platforms, android and iOS in our household and both ecosystems have their pros and cons.

The pen reads how hard or soft you are pressing and responds by drawing a thin or thick tapering line. FYI artists - the sketchbook pro app has a great palm-rejection feature that will only accept pen input on the canvas, so you don't have to worry about stray lines showing up on your work.As others have pointed out, this tablet is also fantastic for note taking.

So far, I'm absolutely thrilled with my decision.Pros:- The screen is very clear and easy to read- The tablet is very snappy, even after loading all my apps, I'm still experiencing no lag- The weight is perfect - it's light enough to hold in one hand while writing with the S-pen- Samsung has added a lot of user-friendly features to Android- The S-pen is a stand-out feature if you like to write and take notes on your deviceOther:- If you're used to a device with on-screen buttons (Nexus 7 for example), it takes a lot of getting used to having physical buttons (and for some reason Samsung put the back button on the right side)- Many have complained about the \"cheap\" build feel of Samsung devices. While this device is plastic, it feels solid in the hand, and the plastic makes it light and very easy to hold in one hand.  Since most are going to put it in a case anyway, the back being plastic really doesn't matter.- The change between stock Android and TouchWiz is drastic.  If you've got a prior TouchWiz device, you'll feel right at home on this one, but if you're coming from Stock Android, be prepared for some adjustment.Cons:- Only minor con is the price, but the S-pen and the hardware/software enhancements required to make it work well justify the additional cost over a Nexus 7 or the other cheap Android tablets out there.You can't really compare this to the Nexus 7 - it serves a very different purpose.

I bought the 8.0 Note after reading all the reviews about what a handy size it is(not too big, and not too small), and went for the Note specifically because the S-pen sounded useful.All I can say is, I love this freakin' thing! Where has it been all my life?This is what the internet experience was meant to be... something akin to having the comfort and flexibility of reading a magazine.The Note downloads web pages extremely fast... in fact all functions are lightning quick, which just makes it a joy to use.I use it as a reader, the screen size and light weight are real pluses here... I use it as a day planner, the S-pen is surprisingly accurate and relatively natural feeling to use once you get alittle bit of a hang of it... there is still a lot of S-pen functionality left for me to learn, but it's so cool to be able to take notes and schedule a calendar without digging through notebooks, and paperwork.I just figured out how to use the Peel app to run my TV... it's just basic functionality(volume/channels), but what makes it pretty awesome for me is that it's also a fully functional TV guide. I'm only viewing over-the-air television, so unless I buy some form of TV guide I'm left to surf through the channels to figure out what's on. Now the Note just tells me what's on, I tap the program I want and I'm there... pretty sweet not having to search the room for the remote either.Cons...I guess it is a bit expensive as far as Android tabs go, but it packs a lot of functionality that I guess no other tab this size does.Mine is a bit creaky, but as long as it keeps functioning like a rock star It doesn't bother me.I can't really compare the screen to some of the super-duper ones out there as I have no experience with them, but playing games, watching video, and using as a reader.. I can't say that I'm disappointed. Doesn't blow me away, but I don't feel short changed either, IMO it looks great.As far as battery life is concerned, I get 2 days normal usage out of a charge. In my experience the screen brightness is what really sucks the juice out of it. If you can live in the bottom quarter-ish of the brightness scale you'll do well.

It's faster and showed the age of my 7.7 with how it handles the whole experience of using a tablet.  I won't go thru all the tech stuff that many have submitted.  But I can address the issue of the upgrade to Jellybean 4.2.2.  Samsung must have corrected the problem that many have described where the multi-window functionality stopped working after installing it.  Mine not only worked fine but to my surprise and pleasure, the unit installed all my apps that I had on my 7.7 and afterwards installed the upgrade with no loss of data.  It even restored all my photos that i had on my other units;I purchased the Moko slim case with a magnet.  It may be a little early to tell if it's the magnet or not but every now and then when I fold the flap in back of the tablet hand touches are nonresponsive.  Oddly enough though, the pen still worked.  If I turn it off and back on again the hand touches worked again.  I will use it without the case for a day or 2 to see if that is the problem.  I heard this unit has had problems with magnetized covers.  Otherwise, the experience I have with this tablet is very similar to what I have with the Note 2.  Excellent.  My only gripe is that it didn't come with a better display.  The colors are beautiful and reading text are sharp but the movie experience is no where near as crisp as the Note 2 or even as crisp as my Galaxy 7.7.  Another complaint that i have read is the size of the bezel.  What a silly quibble.  My 7.7 has the exact same size bezel and it was haled as one of the best tablets of its time.  The thing cost $700 without contract when it came out and now we pay 3-400 for a tab that is more powerful and feature rich and complain it cost too much.  i tried using the other tablets with a thinner bezel and my hand kept touching the darn screen activating various apps I didn't want loaded.Plastic is another issue.  Almost all tablets are made of either plastic or aluminum or a combination of the 2.  Look and feel are subjective preferences but to use a tablet without having a protective cover is not very wise imho.Once you place a cover on it, look and feel go out the window anyway.One more quibble.  Battery life.  Not the greatest.  The note 2 lasts all day with heavy use.  I have never been able to max it out even watching movies, surfing, gaming, using the phone etc.  The Note 8 not so much.  You have to put it on power saving mode to get the best life out of it.  I have only had it for 2 days and I already had to charge it once and right now it's at 74%.  Shame on you Samsung.  My Galaxy 7.7 gets better battery life.  But then again it has a super amoled plus display that uses less power with more punch in color and vibrance.  Better blacks too.Even with these caveats, the Note 8 is a great tablet to use and since it is a tablet and not a phone you get true \"desktop\" web browsing, more screen realestate and Samsung Note apps and usability to boot.  Not bad for $289.  If you want the magazine UI you can download Chameleon Launcher and get the best of both worlds.  Just thought I'd through that in for free.  The launcher needs a little work but it does change the way you see and utilize your tablet.  Better categorizing of home screens etc.Would I recommend the Note 8.0?

The price was irresistible.I couldn't be happier. I was concerned that the screen was a little to small. I use this mainly for watching videos (often on plane rides) and grading papers (college-level Math homework).I got a (free) Android app for annotating PDF's that I use to grade papers electronically. Having the stylus is indispensable for this purpose, especially because it's very difficult to type Mathematical symbols into any word processor. One can use typesetting software, but this is very impractical when you just want to grade papers.Streaming video over wifi (ESPN3, HBOGO, Netflix) works very well. For plane rides, the Android video player works very well. I have to convert some video files to mp4, but there is viable software on the internet (cost-free) to do this. The battery has been more than sufficient for flying coast-to-coast (unlike my old laptop's battery).I highly recommend the Galaxy Note 8.0. I was a little concerned that the screen would be too small, but I find it to be perfect for my purposes. I like Apple products very much, but I don't think I would be as satisfied with an iPad for its lack of stylus and inflexibility with video playback.

The stylus is very useful; takes a bit of practice.  Apps noted as optimized for phone work very well on this tablet (just bigger).Easy to set up out of the box, be ready to log in your Samsung and Google accounts.  Will then import in all your Google and Samsung apps and info.One quirk to be prepared to handle - some users, including me, have a problem when the tablet automatically upgrades from android 4.1.2 (out of box) to 4.2.2.  This happens right away.  I soon noticed that the multi screen feature and the quick screen did not work.  Could not fix.  Went to blogs and learned that this is a known problem (thanks Samsung).  The solution is not as scary as it sounds.  Go to settings,backup and select factory reset.  Reinstalls 4.1.2.  Will automatically update to 4.2.2 again, but this time without the error noted above.  Joy, except you now have to set up the tablet all over again.  Any apps and preferences you earlier set have to be redone.  Cost me a half hour or so.Once past that unpleasantness, great experience and great tablet.

I can now confidently create finished artwork with it.The Note 8 is an outstanding tablet.  It is very capable for media consumption, such as music, video or even ebooks; all in a neat portable package.  I personally bought it for the previous reasons, but also for the possibility of drawing and painting with the most natural input possible.  Using the Layerpaint app, I have integrated it seamlessly into my workflow*; when the mood strikes I just jot a sketch or two and either finish it right there on the spot, or continue at home with my PC.What advantages does it offer against the competition?1)Wacom technology.  It has 1024 levels of pressure sensitivity, which should make your line work look more natural.  Heck, you can easily calibrate the stylus (and even the app, in some cases) if you dislike the pressure curve or the \"cursor\" precision!2)The S-Pen has a small tip!  While some people have enough ability to create art with any tool, I am not skilled enough.  Having a smaller contact point with the screen gives me more control and precision, as opposed to using my fingertip or a fat stylus.3)Can handle high resolution, multi-layer files.  With the app I mention above, I have even created 300 DPI and 600 DPI files.  Why is that significant? Because that's print quality, and you can continue whatever you start in the Note 8 with your laptop and be ready for print or web with minor compromises.The one con, and it's a big one, is that currently there are not as many drawing/painting apps as for iOS, but it's a situation that will be resolved over time; Wacom just released an Android based professional tablet that should move things along in that department.  If you look around though, you will find an app or two that will fulfill your needs, and who knows, it could end up becoming an important part of you art routine too.*My current digital only setup is:  Note 8 + Layerpaint HD + Windows 8 Laptop + Wacom Intuos 3 + Manga Studio EX 5.

It is a premium price for this feature, but I love the S Pen, I'm sick of capacitive styli, and I was willing to pay for this feature. If you aren't interested in having a digitizer stylus, then there are a host of 7-8 inch class tablets for a lot less money. If you want a tablet with this feature that's less that 10 inches, this is your baby.I don't find the resolution to be a problem with any but the smallest fonts, and the system is powerful enough to be fast and fluid in every way. Other people have covered pros and cons fairly well, so I'll add some other things I noticed:The Note 8.0 uses the same Micro USB cable and 5V 2 Amp charger that came with my Galaxy Note 2. I'm used to the proprietary connection on larger tablets, so this was an unexpected perk.There's a lack of cases out there right now for this size device, but I have a Timbuck 2 sleeve for my old Kindle 2 that fits perfectly. The inside dimensions of the sleeve are 150 mm by 222 mm (5-7/8 inches by 8-3/4 inches), and it fits perfectly. You could probably fit it in a case with the inside dimensions of 140 cm x 212 cm, but you'd need some depth to the case (a sleeve that tight might not fit).Update 1 4/24/2013For reference, I've also owned the Asus TF101, TF201, and TF700 tablets. I currently use a Galaxy Note 2 phone; previously I've used a Galaxy Nexus, Droid 3, and Droid X. My impression of the Note 8 is based on comparisons to the other Android devices I've used.Now that I've had this for several weeks, I absolutely love it. The size is perfect for taking with me to work, it's light and easy to hold for hours. The S Pen takes some practice to learn the commands, but now I can take a screenshot and make notes on it in seconds. The S Note app is the best I've used for handwritten notes, the palm rejection finally makes it so I can use a tablet as a notebook. You can import PDFs or images and make notes on them, and you can export them back out as PDFs or images. I've used the split screen a few times to make notes while I watch a video lecture, that feature is very nice.Battery life is excellent for a tablet. I get about 7-8 hours of screen time use before it hits 25%-30% (my cutoff for plugging it in). Screen use is streaming Netflix, browsing the internet, playing games, etc. Standby uses almost no power. I haven't let it sit unused for more than 8 hours, but the battery drop is minimal. I did set WiFi to turn off when the screen isn't on, this helps out battery life on any Android device.I've turned off the motion detection and eye detection. The eye detection had trouble with my eyes, maybe because I wear glasses?The included IR apps are pretty useless to me. We don't have cable on our TVs- we use streaming services, BluRay, and gaming consoles. I have two Samsung TVs, one from 2009, one from 2010. Neither worked well with the included IR apps. There is an app on the Play market that is compatible with the Note 8 IR blaster (Touchsquid Samsung). At $19 for the home version it's expensive, but then I realized that the Logitech Harmony remote I bought a couple years ago was four times the price and died in 3 months. So, I bought the app, and while it has a huge learning curve, I can control my TVs, DVD, BluRay, Xbox360 and Roku devices with the Note. Very cool.For the control freaks out there, the Note 8 rooted in seconds using Framaroot with the Aragorn exploit. THIS VOIDS THE WARRANTY. Unless you explicitly know why you want to root, don't do it.The entire system is fast and fluid. There's no issue with opening a YouTube link, watching the video the switching back to the browser or app. My poor formerly beloved TF700 Infinity has barely been touched since I got the Note 8, because it had big problems with fluid transitions. Bluetooth connections to external speakers (Jawbone Jambox) and headphones (LG Tone HBS-700) keep the audio in sync with the picture, another problem that my TF700 could never overcome.The Samsung keyboard is AWESOME! I love the swipe input and one-hand mode. Swipe input on tablets can be hit or miss, depending on the keyboard, but the Samsung keyboard in one-hand mode is small enough so swipe inputs can be done quickly. Also, it will automatically open handwriting recognition when the S Pen is pulled out. Previously, Swype was my keyboard of choice, but the Samsung keyboard is the most functional and comprehensive stock keyboard I've ever used.I continue to see reviews comparing this to the iPad Mini and Nexus 7. I stand by my assertion that there simply is NO comparison. Neither has expandable storage, digitizer stylus, or IR blaster. The stylus and IR blaster are not must-have features, but they are 100% worth the price difference.

First, the Samsung Note 8.0 has an SD slot and I can add additional storage space for a very small cost. Second, the size, this tablet is the size of the iPad mini (I have a full size iPad). The Note 8.0 is much lighter, smaller and it fits in my purse. I can access my work e-mail via the touchdown app (not a huge fan of the app, but it is what my employer requires and it functions), I can easily connect the tablet to a wireless keyboard, and it is easier to read a book on the Samsung Note 8.0 than on a full sized iPad.A second important comparison. My husband bought a Verizon Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 for me as a gift. It was $100 more than the regular Tab 2 because it was compatable with Verizon and this Note 8.0 cost  $100 more than the Verizon Tab 2 and it is not 4G LTE. Within 11 days I maxed out the  Tab 2. The Tab 2 has 1GB of  RAM and this was not enough to support all of the things that I wanted my tablet to be able to do. The guy at Best Buyin the  Samsung department told me that sure I could switch and use my iPhone 5 to access the internet as a hot spot when I was not near Wifi, but that it would  not  be  very fast or as smooth as the Tab 2. I paid the additional $100 and upgraded to the Note 8.0 any way. This was  the best decision!!! This tablet is so much faster than the Tab 2!!! I am so happy that I made the switch!!!In the end, there are some things that I prefer to do on the iPad and based  on the  technology there are some things that just work better  on the Apple iOS than on Android, but  if  had to pick between the ipad or ipad mini and the Galaxy Note 8.0 I would pick the Note 8.0 hands down.I hope this helps you and if you have any questions I will do my best to answer.9/29/13 - the other day I tried to watch an Amazon instant video  only to find that Flash would not work and even though an Amazon video android app exists it will not work on this or other Samsung devices. I was going to drop this by one star but this appears to be an Amazon decision, not a Samsung decision. It appears that the only Android device that will work is the Kindle Fire. Unfortunately Amazon will let this app work on Apple devices just not other Androids. This is frustrating, but ultimately I decided this was an Amazon issue and not an issue with the device.

Some of this stuff is just completely unnecessary to put on a device.  \"Samsung Cares\".  A video demo of the device (for retail).  Samsung, are you kidding me????Reading Mode.  Very cheap trick, doesn't even dim the screen.  Download an app to give yourself more appropriate lighting when in the dark.No ability to change your notification bar toggles.  I LOVE how they made this possible on the S4Settings are hard to find and plentiful.  It will take you a week to find all the little tweaks and features of this beast.  Once you find them all, you'll appreciate the product more and more. Still, the layout isn't the easiest to follow.I hope this brought new info to the table.  It's a great tab, but I have yet to buy a electronic item that is \"perfect\".  Too me, the Asus Prime came the closest.  BUT...if you need a note taking machine that is a bit more portable than the glitchy 10.1 edition....go for this one.  You won't be disappointed.  If you aren't stuck on Pure Android this is the best smaller tablet on the market.

But the fire only whetted my appetite for a 'real' android tablet--I.e., one not so buried in the kindle ui, so I bought a galaxy tab 2 10.1. It was very convenient and fast, but not so handy as the fire had been. In fact, I liked the fire so much that I've given three of them as gifts. Meanwhile, I kept being tempted by the note 2, thinking it would be a better all-around device than my tab. I love being able to draw and make notes as well as surf and watch and write. When the ipad mini came out,  I considered it, but it just didn't feel quite right in my hand, and I had become a devoted fan of the android os by then. So, I was hoping Samsung would make a note 7.0, doing all the things I wanted but costing less than the note 2. After all, there's wifi nearly everywhere now.When I heard the next note would be an 8.0\" device, I almost went ahead and bought the 10.1 version, thinking the 8.0\" size would be nearly as big a hand full, so why not have more real estate to doodle on,especially Iin the duel screen mode.But, the introduction day for the note 8.0 found me at Bestbuy, holding the note 8.0, which is enough different in proportions from the ipad mini to make all the difference. The greater pixel density more than makes up for the 2\" smaller screen than the 10.1. And, it's noticeably faster,  at least than the tab 2.After 2 months of daily use,  I am as pleased as I have ever been with any purchase. The battery lasts all day, and it's just a very pleasant little device to carry around. It's hardly heavier than my kindle touch, which seldom leaves the house now . It's surprising easy to see the screen in most light conditions. The keyboard is an easy size to use with one or two hands, and it has the best hand-writing recognition I've yet found, alhough sometimes it decides my capital letters are numerals.The major drawback is that I wish Samsung had immediately introduced it with more memory.Would I recommend it to a friend?  Not necessarily. If you just want to surf the net and watch movies or play games or listen to music, then there are several 7.0 tablets out there at much lower prices. I've been giving the tab 2 7.0's as gifts now that the price is so low, but the nexus is also excellent.But if you want a tablet for creating stuff, the note 8.0 seems the best choice available now.", "Date": "June 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "A truly perfect size", "Author": "David M.", "ReviewID": "RV9W1PNX3A5U4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "***5/17/13***Update: I just noticed the price drop to $379.99.

I was hoping to see a small price drop after the initial release, but when that didn't happen, I wanted to grab this before the Play credit of $25 went away.So, as I state, this is truly a perfect carry around size for me. I've had no issue with the back button as some people have stated, and the feel of the pen is so close to actual writing that I have almost gone to it all the time for my email and note taking. I put on a Minuguard clear screen protector and find that it gives just the slightest drag on the pen to make it feel like writing on paper.I had been going back and forth between this item and either the Kindle Fire HD or the Nexus. If you want to use the pen, have a rear camera, and card storage, then this item is a no-brainer. If you want something to consume media, then the Kindle Fire HD has the best screen I have ever seen in this size package. The Nexus was the least expensive, was easy to carry also, but I was hooked on the S-pen of the Note and needed a camera for my work.With all that said, the only thing holding me back was the $399 price. But, with the 2 years of 50gig Dropbox, and the $25 Play credit, you can drop that $399 down to $300. Also, this tablet comes with the charger.

In my mind this is the *only* mid-size tablet that gets pen input right, which is unique.  The digitizer based screen is a HUGE benefit and makes note taking or sketching very pleasant.  I use this every day for taking notes and it actually works -- fast and accurate.  AND one of the least-often touted advantages of the digitizer is the fact you can *hover* buttons in a browser, so pull-downs and other menus are actually usable.  No other tablet -- iPad or otherwise -- can do that.I have also looked at tablet PCs from Microsoft, Sony, etc but keep coming back to the Galaxy Notes as the best option for portability, features, app selection, and price.  Even now after the release of Nexus 7 and iPad mini retina I still think this is the best tablet for artists or note takers.  If you just need a tablet for touch, I agree with other reviewers that you can get a better bang for the buck with a Nexus 7 or non digitizer-based tablet.Of course, no product is perfect so here are some things I would want in the next version:- Higher res screen, 1080p or better- Bigger stylus with more weight (I bought a separate Samsung stylus, don't use the original)- Better battery life -- I get about 1 day with heavy use, 2 days with light use, 2.5 days at standby.

This seemed to work for a few days and then the issues started again.  I worked with Samsung support and saw that pressing the screen was now making it change colors.  Now I knew this was a hardware issue.  Support sent me a link to print the label and shipping was free.  It took less than a week to get the Note fixed and returned (fortunately I live close to a service center).  The Note has worked great since.  One other downside was that I added a 64GB micro SD card and forgot to remove it before sending it in.  The card was not supposed to be touched but it was removed and not returned.  I called Samsung and they promised to send an AMEX gift certificate that will basically cover the cost of the SD card.  The AMEX gift cheque arrived today.", "Date": "October 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "my son love it!", "Author": "7300gilbert", "ReviewID": "R1ZN3QB19XXOXM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "now he barely look into his laptop anymore ...it's very good for university student to take any notes and even recording.love it!", "Date": "September 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "tablet and then some", "Author": "GrDnMM", "ReviewID": "R1SBOI6DKFH7KR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!

There's no tablet out there going to top the 10.1, not even samsung's predecessor in what they first said was going to be a 8 inch version of there 10.1 with stronger processors and better battery, they fell short on both categories! Don't get me wrong it's not quite going back to the store just yet, love the form factor up to the 10.1! I personally think that samsung put harsh processor restrictions on this unit! Photo shop touch is not here unlike on the 10.1 and video editor isn't either,  video editor is available via samsung's app store (free) and photo shop touch through play store for a very high 9.99! One of this units highlights is the ease of charging through micro b usb , it's always been a hassle on 10.1 with it's proprietary cable to charge with anything other than a wall adapter!

The Note 8 will not \"see\" some wireless networks. After some trial and errors I manage to solve this issue by changing my wifi router settings (you can read about the problem and the solution here: [...] ).The S-Pen is a nice feature, but since I use evernote which does not support S-Pen there is not much use for it (for me), unless you use Samsung's S-Note.

Having the ability to write my notes is much more intuitive to me that to hunt and peck at an on screen keyboard.  But, all the capacitive stylus hardware and software I have tried is crude and inaccurate. Basically a waste of time.  So I thought I'd give the Galaxy Note a try.  I have always wondered why, if Palm could make it work (albeit with a shorthand language) 15 years ago, why couldn't someone make it work really well today, given the advances in software and processing power.  Well, Samsung seems to have done just that.  So while in other respects this tablet is really not noticeably different than other 7/8 inch tablets, for me, the pen really makes a difference.So why only 4 starts?  First, I reserve 5 for near perfect only, and this is great, but has a couple issues:  1) the smooth glossy back. It may look pretty, but it doesn't give much grip. I prefer my (now given away) Nexus 7 in that regard.  2) the size - while 8 inch does give noticeably more screen size, it goes from being easily hand held, to marginal - really a bit big for long term holding.  I don't have huge hands, but their not tiny either - probably average to slightly large for men. I could see this bordering on being a two hand device for women.

This is my second Galaxy Note 8 device, as the first device arrived with defects and was returned.  However,I decided to give the Note 8 another chance and I'm glad I did.For several years, I've been searching for a suitable device that would enable me to plan and track various events in my life. Prior to owning the Note 8, I've tried just about every tablet available. IMHO, this is the first tablet that has really brought all the processes together on one device for me.If you're the type of person who likes to plan out (to the extent we can) every \"thing\" in your life, including Plan B & C, then the Note 8 just might be just the device for you!  Everything you'll need is on the device or available for download.Be prepared for an interesting journey of learning about the Note 8 and how you can make it work for you.The battery life, despite using all the various tricks to make it last longer, could certainly be improved by Samsung.  But I manage and so will you.Otherwise, the Note 8 is also a great web hopper, e-reader and entertainment device. I'm not a gamer (as we speak) so I can't comment regarding potential gaming ability.And lest I forget, that giant \"Hulk Hogan toothpick\" that comes with the Note 8 is a BLAST to use and play with!For the money and all the capabilities that the Note 8 comes with, I believe it's a purchase that you will not regret.UPDATE for 15 Sept 2013Unfortunately, my Galaxy Note 8 started having difficulties with extremely poor battery life, overheating and dropping WiFi signals. There were other intermittent problems as well, and these are some of the same problems I experienced with the first Galaxy Note 8.UPS is picking up the Note on Monday for return and I'm back to relying on my first gen Kindle Fire HD.

Six months later, I purchased the Galaxy S III and I was captivated by its potentials.  Upon reading the specs and various reviews for the Note 8.0 Wi-Fi, I was impressed.  The first notable item was replacing the 30-pin proprietary charging plug with the micro USB which effectively simplifies the process!  The second element was the dramatic improvement to the S-pen over the 10.1 which makes writing smoother and elegant.  The convenient storage and accessibility when needed in the body of the tablet enables it to be ergonomically clean.  The size of the Note 8.0 is ideal - not as \"small\" as the 7.0 or a large as 10.1.  One word can easily sum it up - mobility.  Yes, it not a direct replacement for a laptop or ultra notebook but, it certainly gets about 90 percent of my work done.  The third factor is the Smart Stay which keeps the screen on as you are looking at it.  This feature negates you from having to constantly touch the screen in order for it not to time-out as in the Tab 2 7.0.With regards to the display of the screen, it still manages to be vivid despite it not being an Amoled.  Colors appear to be true, natural and not washed out when watching movies on Netflix and Vudu.  The processor is fast as I have not experienced any lags and the transitions thus far have been flawless which also makes multi-tasking a great asset to this tablet.  The only negative comment would be the battery life.  It is anticipate that with the 4.2 update this should improve.

The s-pen makes this tablet what it is.  The Wacom style digitizer makes sketching and note taking a breeze.  I draw almost daily now where I used to go through spurts of occasional drawing because I would seldom take my sketchbook with me.  Now the sketchbook is always close at hand.For my church, I'm responsible for the leadership meeting minutes/notes and I found that writing on the note 8 is natural and less intrusive than something with a physical keyboard.  The handwriting recognition is pretty good for normal words but gets confused easily when writing out less common names/places or words unique to our faith.  Because of this, I've abandoned the handwriting to text to just handwriting in the excellent S-Note and Lecture Note apps for simplicity.  Less correcting of the incorrect auto-correct that way.  For short notes or writing in other apps the handwriting recognition is good enough.Other aspects of the tablet are fine. The IR port works but is kind of irrelevant to me as I seldom watch TV with it.  Screen resolution is plenty sharp for my near-sighted eyes.  The processor is quick and snappy and I've barely used up much of the 16gb (more like 8 or 9 after all the preloaded Samsung stuff).  I have an SD card to expand the memory but haven't needed much of that space either except for my growing collection of sketches.  The expandability is nice if I ever do run out of space.Overall I love the tablet as it allows me to create content easily and not merely consume it.

It's so handy,  it can easily fit into the smaller lady's bag. The size of the screen did not affect the quality of my view of the other apps like the S Note because the size of the notepad does not really exceed 8\".There were some revisions with the apps from the Note 8 that weren't in Note 10.1 like the calculator which I can access from the home screen or the quick menu when in S Note mode (meaning when the S Pen is removed from its slot). I don't know how to include the Calculator in the quick tray.  In Note 10.1, the calculator was accessible from the quick menu (tabs from the bottom when you use the ^ button).Also the screen capture is done via a hand motion which I'm still trying to perfect because once my hand movement touches the screen there is a tendency for my screen to change, hence the screen that I am trying to capture is no longer the same.  But I guess this will just need just a little practice.The apps on board the Note 8 (and the 10.1) are quite useful especially the Polaris Office and the Group Play.

Excellent resolution.-S Pen is excellent for drawing/handwritten notes-Size is perfect for holding with one hand.-GPS-Powerful processor and plenty of memory.  Haven't had issues in video playback with a dozen apps running.-mSDHC allowing the OPTION to carry around a multitude of files and apps-Responsive touch screen.-Includes Polaris Office-S Calendar seems to work better.-My Note 2 S pen works on this as well and vice-versa.-Samsung includes a Swype like keypad.What I didn't necessarily like...-Sound is so-so, as expected from a tablet this size and this thin.-Price.  Comparable to the iPad mini in spec and price...SUMMARY:  If you're looking for a well constructed tablet that provides Play store access, a stylus for that tactile experience, excellent video and extra features such as GPS and mSDHC AND have $400 to boot, then this is your tablet.

Unfortunately, I'm still looking, after having bought and experimented with the Samsung Note 8. I will update my review in the future as appropriate, but at this point, I'm not happy.Using the S Note application with the S Pen for text recognition is an exercise in frustration. I tried writing a list in freehand, which would be transcribed into text. What I found was that it was difficult to fix transcription errors while writing, the transcription couldn't keep up, the margins changed randomly and the text lines would shift.I looked for meaningful documentation that would clearly explain the functionality of the S Note application and I couldn't find any. There are a lot of buttons and options, but no clear documentation. The videos that Samsung provides are interesting, but very peripheral and don't really help someone who has bought the tablet and needs to do something with it. The videos appear to be mostly pre-sales marketing tools.A random annoyance is that the Google Now widget displays \"cards\", but upon clicking the widget, the device apologies that Google Search has \"stopped\".I already own an iPad 3 and was hoping this device would meet my requirements for a small device I could pull out for writing notes as needed. However I'm a disappointed with the Note 8 at this point.Update #1 (March 16, 2014, updating rating  to 2 stars): It appears the Google Now problem is related to a recent update.  A commenter on Google Search in the \"Play Store\" claimed having the same problem with Google Now on a Note 8. I had cleared the Google Search cache and data to no avail.  When I backed out of the Google Search update, Google Now appeared to behave correctly.Having dug around a bit more with the \"S Note\" application, I understand it better. Yet, challenges persist:1) There is a noticeable period (perhaps an average of 2 seconds) where the tablet is working on the text recognition and the tablet is not accepting input from the S Pen.  This results in a period where one is writing freehand text, but the tablet is not recording the writing.  This makes writing more than a few words at a time frustrating.  Understanding how the text recognition algorithm works and allowing for adjustment would be helpful here.  For example, it would be useful if I could set a timer which waited for perhaps 5 seconds after the last S Pen \"stroke\" before attempting text recognition.2) Looking at example \"templates\", the maximum number of words in the template appear to be a sentence or less. This would suggest that the software developers either didn't design the application to handle more than a sentence at a time, or there are hardware limitations which makes attempting to write more than a sentence at a time difficult.3) A hope is that there exist other applications which work with the Note 8 that have a better text recognition workflow. As I learned when I wrote freehand text on my iPad, it's nifty that I can write this text, but it's not so nifty that my options for doing something with the writing (such as text recognition) afterwards are limiting.A different random annoyance is that when opening up Google News with the \"Internet\" or \"Chrome\" browsers, the screen appears to initially render completely, but all of the news and headline text disappears.In my experience, the automatic brightness adjustment causes the screen to be too dark or dim in many cases.", "Date": "March 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Wacom stylus.", "Author": "Matvey Shishov", "ReviewID": "R3IPA5SH7QDX2D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Due to the well implemented Wacom stylus, I gave it one more pen than the tablet itself deserves.

My only complaint is I wish the Multi-Window feature supported more apps. Not even Google Drive is supported, which is a huge bummer for me since I use that app more than most.

Performance is flawless and I have experiences no glitches of any kind.  I got the Samsung note mostly because of the note/stylus feature and also because, unlike almost every other tablet out there, it has an SD slot so you can add up to 64 GB more storage.  By comparison, the iPad mini with 64 GB of built-in storage will run you about $500 and if the note feature of the Samsung is important to you then you will be missing out on that too.  So when you compare this tablet with others, make sure you are comparing machines with the same features or the comparison will not mean much.My only regret is that I didn't just go ahead and get the 10.1 (2014 edition) version since the 8.0 can be a bit small at times.  The trade off is the fact that the 8.0 is a bit more portable and of course lighter but I think I would have rather have traded the slight loss of portability for the extra screen size.  If you are considering an 8\" tablet, give this some thought.  Its not like you can put the 8.0 in your pocket anyway so you don't lose a whole lot by stepping up to the larger size (other than the increased price, of course.)

Originally I rated this 5 stars....read on for the dire consequences....I am updating my review 4 months later after spending 6+ hours on the phone today with Samsung.DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!At this point, I would NEVER BUY ANOTHER SAMSUNG PRODUCT AGAIN!!!  Like NEVER EVER!!!  I just spent OVER 6 hours on the phone with customer service/technical support and remote-in people.  I believe that this is about the updates which totally ruin the device.  As you can see by my initial review below, I loved the device initially.  I did not do any updates for over a month, not even the initial ones with this replacement device from Amazon.  At that point, I was loving the machine.  Then, I found that the initial updates made irreversible changes, even with rebooting and factory data reset it did not solve the issues.  They also told me once you do the updates, the only way to get the \"known bad updates\" off of the device is to send the device to them for a few weeks for them to get it to out of box condition.  They refuse to send new device or give refund.  I started calling in mid January with these issues.  I was told they would be fixed with the next update.  Wrong!  Instead, things have just gotten worse and worse WITH EACH UPDATE.  More things wrong with every update.  Do not update your device!!!  Even one of the tech people says he has automatic updates permanently off.  I should have returned to Amazon in January as it was still under warranty, however, Samsung reps kept telling me the issues would be fixed with the next update.  Nothing got fixed.  Things only became worse.  MUCH WORSE!!!1. The S-Planner calendar in List mode puts your calendar items on the WRONG DAY.  But, it doesn't shift everything to the wrong day, only some things, so you can't just mentally think everything is one day off as you don't know which items are on the correct day and which are on the wrong day.2.  I am bounced off the internet for no reason with the apology \"internet connection is lost\", however, there was no problem with the internet connection at the location I was at, it was the device.3.  I get com.android. is not working message and it bounces you off everything, internet and all.  Everything you were doing is lost.4.  The Awesome Note HD and S Note programs will just quit with no backup to what you were doing.5.  Polaris files disappear without notice after saving.  One actually turned all text in one file into a \"?' with a dark diamond around it after saving while Samsung rep was remotely connected.  They still won't replace device.6.  There are tons of other things wrong that a Factory reset did not fix.  They want to take 4 weeks to repair and give me back the same device. Without my data of course, as that is of no concern to them.7.  Not a one of the Polaris files are in the document folder under My Files, not even the PDFs, not the ones I actually typed in, etc.  Good luck finding your documents when they are not where they are suppose to be.  But then again, they just may not exist anymore, so you better check for all your documents regularly to assure they still exist.8.  There were no documents in the my files section that were for Awesome note either.  I was told by Samsung reps that they were suppose to be there.  I can only see them under the Awesome Note application.7.  There are many more issues, but I am tired of typing about them....  It belongs in the scrap pile when you cannot even offload your data from it.I am tired of dealing with them for 3 months.  I have been on the phone for OVER 6 hours just today and I still have not been able to get my data off the device (with the help from both the tech support and remote help people) and they still cannot tell me how to off-load all my data to my computer.  What is with that?  Yet, they will take it back for 4 weeks to put it back to out of box condition, although all the updates will still be on it.  And all of my data that I cannot retrieve will be OBLITERATED!!!So, without being able to move my data off of the Galaxy Note 8, they are offering to wipe the device, (after I send it in to them).  They do not understand that I may actually need some of that data and that IT WILL NOT BE RETRIEVABLE AFTER THEY WIPE IT.BOO ON 'EXECUTIVE' CUSTOMER SERVICE FOR SAMSUNG.  THEIR POLICIES ARE RIDICULOUS.  THEY CANNOT GIVE ME A NEW DEVICE TO LOAD MY DATA TO, SO I AM TOTALLY OUT OF LUCK.  I HAVE TO KEEP THIS PIECE OF CRAP BECAUSE I CAN'T OFFLOAD MY IMPORTANT DATA.  SAMSUNG does not know how to offload my data.  If I hear them say they can only do and such one more time (which includes throwing away my data, I will croak.I will note that I did speak to a couple of tech people and one of the remote people were very helpful in trying to get to the bottom of the issue, but when they leave you saying that they have to do further research to see if it is even possible, then there is no hope.  They connect you to executive customer service who tells you to send it in.  With your data still on it.  SamSUNG STINKS!  DO NOT BUY SAMSUNG PRODUCTS!IF Samsumg finally gets off the stick and fixes this issue, I will re-post here, but I am guessing that this was a total waste of $400.00 and countless hours of my time as I have been trying to get this fixed for 3 months now.  I could seriously use that money for things other than a broken box.  I'm going back to paper and pencil, at least nothing happens to a paper calendar and paper notes, etc.  Daytimer here I come.  Larger sure, but you won't lose all your data because the box doesn't work right and the company won't do the right thing and replace it despite their people not being able to fix it.Here was my original review:  Lots to love with this little tablet.  The pen, to be able to convert your handwriting to text.  Voice recognition, so you can speak to write a note in text.  Lots and lots of little surprises of what this device can do.  The 360 degree photos are great!Couple of things not quite right, so I am sending back for another:It says it is 16GB.  When you open it up it clearly says it only has 9.85GB TOTAL.  So get the 64GB card.The calendar is great and morphs into different views.  The problem is, in list view, things end up on the wrong day.  In the monthly calendar view they were on the correct day, list view and a couple of the other views, some of the items were on the wrong day, some on the right day, even when looking at one certain day.

Joab\"", "ReviewID": "R3L6P2YO6EPUSX", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I went into this tablet with the highest of hopes. I really wanted an Android tablet that could truly replace my trusty iPad.When I opened the box, the first thing I noticed was this beautiful white plastic and glass staring back at me. Looks nice. I picked it up, and it felt good in the hands, so i plugged it in and let it charge before turning it on.Once I turned it on, things became messy. I noticed an inconsistent user interface even upon startup. Some screens were obviously Samsung designed, while others were obviously designed by Google. The Samsung screens asked me to sign up for a Samsung account. I figured I better do that, I'll probably need it later. After sign up, it then prompts me oddly as to whether I want to backup and/or restore from my Samsung account. Being a brand new account, there would be nothing to restore, so I selected \"backup\". It then warned me everything on the server missing from my device would be erased if I continued. How disjointed.I was approaching the end of setup, and it now asks if I want \"easy mode\". Wait, what's easy mode? There was a oddly worded explanation that I really didn't get, so I went ahead with easy mode. I knew this would be different than my experience with the Nexus 7, since that device is a \"true Google\" device and I had heard there were some differences.As it came up to the desktop, I was impressed with the screen quality. I feel like it was definitely a little better than the iPad mini's, but maybe a little over saturated on the colors. I tried out a few of the in-device apps and felt underwhelmed so far. I bought this with a primary desire to write notes using the stylus; I found the stylus not much better than my Bamboo stylus for the iPad, although it was easier to write with. However, my hand kept hitting the back and even with the stylus in my hand, it kept bring up this menu. I found a trick online to turn the device upside down and use it that way, and that definitely made things better.I wanted to use Sketchbook Pro, so I purchased and downloaded that from the Google Play store. It worked well, but nothing tremendous. The pressure sensitivity seemed off; it was either light or dark, and there didn't seem to be a lot of pressure levels in between. Having used Bamboo and Intuos tablets before, I expected better from a Wacom digitizer.I tried out the handwriting recognition in place of the keyboard; I found that to be extremely unreliable. If I have to stop after every word to make sure it recognized it correctly, then it is useless. I will admit, my hand writing is rather atrocious, but not completely illegible. It would present words that weren't even close to what I wrote sometimes. Other times it put extra periods in.It was really cool that when I was at the home screen, it would present a notes screen when I took the stylus out if its holder. To me, that was awesome that it was designed to detect that.The voice on their Siri/Google Now replacement, S-Voice, is atrocious. It sounds like someone was running Siri down a drain and threw on the disposal unit for good measure. I would have preferred it just default to Google Now instead... but I couldn't find anything in the settings to minimize the awful Samsung supplied layers.I would say my biggest concern when buying the device also turned out to be my most obvious as I held it. It had a good weight, nice and light, but not too light. However, every time I shifted my hand a little, I heard a squeak. I couldn't figure out what it was at first, so I went into settings to figure out what was making the noise. Turns out, it was the plastic rubbing against itself at the seams. Unfortunately, this plastic device was flexing and bending and squeaking like nobodies business. I am not adverse to plastic devices, as I own a Nokia Lumia 920, but this was horrendous. The back with slight pressure would push in slightly, and just holding the device or picking it up caused the squeaking of the plastic. I felt if this was a under-$300 device, this type of build quality would be acceptable... but to charge a $70 premium over the iPad mini and to have such poor build quality to me was unacceptable.I didn't like this device, but I am certain it is a good device for some. My ideal device is a true Android Jelly Bean interface, a solid construction with no squeaking seams, a good responsive active stylus, and a consistent interface. Right now, that just isn't this device, or any Android tablet on the market right now. I really wanted an excuse to leave the iPad behind, but this wasn't it. I look forward to the device that wins me over.", "Date": "May 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "4.5 Stars for the Tablet itself, 1 Star for Samsung Support", "Author": "Ms N. Boone", "ReviewID": "R1ISZWNAFKYN6C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "UPDATE:I own the iPad 3, the Amazon Kindle Fire HD 7\" and this tablet.  Unless streaming Prime movies on the Fire HD 7\", the Note 8 had become my \"go to\" tablet, while my poor iPad sat ignored.  I did ultimately buy a Kindle Paperwhite 2nd Gen for reading, because tablet batteries run down too fast if one is a heavy reader.  My Galaxy Note 8 is still working perfectly, it's still quite a nice tablet, and it's still the best (perhaps only) option if you desire pen functionality.Despite my abysmal Samsung customer service experiences, I actually broke down and replaced my iPhone 4 with a Galaxy Note 3, and it is amazing. As in BEST.  PHONE.  EVER. So these days I rarely use ANY of my tablets.  I use my Note 3 for pretty much everything except reading eBooks (love my Kindle Paperwhite), and of course my PC is for more intensive tasks.The pen functionality in the Note 3 is superior to the Note 8.  Assuming second generation Note 8 models incorporate that improved pen functionality/integration and offer a higher screen resolution, they could very well be the 7-8\" tablet to beat.  I personally recommend waiting for the next-gen Note 8 if you're in the market for a penabled 8\" tablet. If you also need a new phone, get a Note 3 and see if you even feel the need for a tablet at all.  That said, Amazon tablets are wonderful (especially if you are a Prime subscriber) and I frequently recommend them (Fire HD or HDX depending upon budget) to friends and family.  I also still feel that if one doesn't care too much about the pen, Amazon tablets are a much better buy.Original review:If you really want the \"penabled\" experience in an 8\" form factor, this is the only way to go - if you can get over the risk and hassle of having to deal with Samsung's incompetent customer service, their frequently buggy (and poorly maintained) web site, and the premium price charged for a content consumption device with disappointing screen quality (only 189 ppi).That said, features aside from the pen that recommend this product include:- The extra screen real estate of an 8\" screen over a 7\" screen- The ability to use Samsung's \"split screen\" Multi-view mode (only works for certain apps)- The bundled apps; some of the S-Pen apps are quite nice (I confess I rarely use them), while others are simply bloatware that permanently eat your storage space unless you root the device.- $25 Google Play credit - IF you can get them to fulfill it.  It took me months, multiple attempts to register, and finally contacting them four times via various methods.  No FaceBook to publicly call them to task, no love.- 50 GB Free Drop Box (limited duration of two years)- Micro-SD slot - although bear in mind that you won't be able to actually install most applications there unless you root your tablet (I have not).  Still, nice for music/movies/photos/eBooks.If you don't feel the pen or dual-app/split screen functionality are \"must haves,\" then honestly, save money and consider the Kindle Fire HD 7\".  It has a better screen (216 ppi), better speakers, better battery life AND it costs WAY less (plus, free eBook loans with Prime!). Amazon has always treated me well, so I have nothing but praise for their customer service.  If the Kindle Fire HD 7\" isn't pretty enough or you don't like the Amazon App store (and don't want to root), consider the iPad Mini.  Still compromising on the screen (it's even slightly worse than the Note 8 at 163 ppi - shame on Apple!), but it's also somewhat less expensive, has a beautiful, svelte aluminum body - and Apple *also* has amazing customer service.  I can't speak to the customer service, but the (sorry Amazon) Nook HD is also a nice 7\" tablet, actually has the best screen in the 7\" form factor (243 ppi), Google Play Store access (no rooting required, although it's possible if you desire), includes a micro-SD card slot, and is going for fire sale pricing.  On the minus side, the Nook HD has a proprietary charge port - but you can stock up on spare charge cables with all the money you save.If you plan to read a lot of eBooks and don't also have or want an e-ink reader, consider going for the Kindle Fire HD - or better yet the higher PPI Nook HD (you can always download the Kindle app) - your eyes will thank you for it.", "Date": "May 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Would be great if it were cheaper", "Author": "Lopro23 \"Lopro23\"", "ReviewID": "R1ATPX59NJL26H", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I had to return this tablet mainly because of the cost/benefit ratio.

There is such a great feel to the touchscreen and the way it allows you to move back and forth within the applications. However, as much as I wanted to like this product and learn how to work it I continue to have difficulty. I purchased it approximately two weeks ago and have worked with it for short periods everyday. The purchase was made so that I could keep it at the office and watch my favorite show on Amazon Prime during lunch break. (I can do this on my IPAD) as well as take notes during meetings.I quickly found watching my programs on Amazon Prime wasn't an option as you need Adobe Acrobat in order to watch TV, movies or video particularly from Amazon Prime (almost unlimited TV, movies with my $80/year membership). Unfortunately, this system isn't compatible with Adobe. So, I tried searching the internet for a fix and found a suggestion to download \"MX Player\"  which would supposedly give me the ability to play any video. Oops, didn't work....still can't play TV or movies unless I purchase them from Google Play. Okay, so nix that. How about I concentrate on the note taking feature with the app S Note. I figure I can still use the pad to take notes during our companies endless meetings.Well, the S Note application would be wonderful to take notes in if I could just figure out how to work its many features. The basics of writing on the pad are obvious. But, getting too much further than writing and flipping to a new page starts to get a little more complicated. So that's when I started looking, in earnest, for a user manual since my search through the internet wasn't yielding much help. Voila, I googled and found the user manual on-line by searching through Samsung's website. (It was hidden pretty deep). Once I found the on-line manual, I also realized there's a user manual on the pad itself. However, since theres no \"search\" option on the Samsung Galaxy Note I didn't actually \"find\" the user manual - I just happened up on it. Okay, so I started browsing through the user manual and found the following helps for S Note: Select a note template, Compose notes, Insert multimedia files, Using productivity tools, Browsing notes, Viewing notes. Great - but nothing on how to Save a note, Change the name of a note, Save to a particular day, event, etc. So that if I need to find my notes from a particular meeting I'm still not sure how to do this. I tried to change the name of a note and couldn't do it. Neither the on-line user manual nor the Samsung user manual helped me with this very necessary feature. While that's frustrating enough,  I'm sure there are even more features I will need help on that hasn't even occurred to me yet - and I don't have time to muddle through and find out how to use the details of this system by trial and error.There are many neat features on this pad. If you have time to play around and figure it out then go for it. If you have $400.00 to spend though, I would suggest an Ipad or Kindle Fire. Either will give you the features you find on this system plus more. As I said, I wanted to like the Samsung Galaxy 8.0, but am sorry to say I'm packing it up and shipping it back.", "Date": "August 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Can't get to set up my tablet", "Author": "Harold Shibuya", "ReviewID": "R1JKEUWPZD4POZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I received my Samsung Galaxy note 8 but there are nothing loaded?
