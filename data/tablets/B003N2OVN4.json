positive given the flexibility of using my existing PC applications and using it as a tablet for reading e-books, surfing the internet, and watching videos. One pleasant surprise is that the wide screen display gives me a much better internet browsing experience than my other existing netbooks. In my opinion, it does a lot more than an iPad with a similar price as its low-end model.The multi-touch experience is not the best but it works quite well after some training.Hope you enjoy this videoCheers", "Date": "November 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Lenovo listened to complaints", "Author": "Michael Epting", "ReviewID": "RTCXEA1DVL6YE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Two things: this model (-85U) comes with Windows 7 Home Premium and with a 4-cell battery. Home Premium, unlike Starter, has a ton of built-in touchscreen features that all work well with this machine. If you read the reviews of the -37U version of the S10-3T, you'll see that many people complained about the size and weight of the 8-cell battery.About speed -- I uninstalled most of the Lenovo \"extras\" and swapped the RAM for a 2 GB module (I used the Crucial only because it was Prime-eligible). The printed manual has clear instructions for replacing the RAM. At this point, the machine is quite snappy except when it isn't. That is, when Windows decides to do an upgrade or when some process runs amok, the machine becomes nearly unusable. The rest of the time, it is fine.I really wanted an Android tablet, but since no acceptable one yet exists, this was a good compromise solution. I like having Windows, with its unlimited supply of applications, but I don't like the larger size and weight nor the limited battery life (I think it may be less than 3 hours, but I haven't run it down yet). For the best info, search for Jesse B Anderson's stuff -- he'll help you decide.", "Date": "July 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Perfect...", "Author": "Jeffrey N.

I find myself in the basement less and less. Still use the PC for photoshop work, development stuff, games, etc.I too upgraded to 2 GB of RAM...you just have to...it'll make or break your perception of the netbook. I also use the SD card slot for ReadyBoost, saw def improvements with that as well. I removed a ton of the 'bloatware' (mainly lenovo pre-installed applications) that came with it. Also made some tweaks via [...]......great site for getting the most out of your S10-3T.My 4 negatives (but by no means a deal breaker):No bluetooth (i ordered a usb one)No way (yet) to upgrade the CPUBattery only lasts like 3 hours with WiFi on, though if i had the 8 cell, a negative might be the weight...right now i can hold it with one hand while readingNo SSD drive....from what I have read it really increases performance. Once they come down in price for larger ones (250GB+), i'll upgrade mineAnyway...if you are not sure about the iPad, and don't want to wait for a legitimate Tablet PC, this will def be worth it.", "Date": "July 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Sleeper product: better and more popular than expected", "Author": "WriterGirl \"WriterGirl\"", "ReviewID": "R26C7V6BACVLE0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was surprised by the size and weight. I thought it would be larger and heavier, but it's about the same size and weight as the HP Mini 10.2\". My unit has the 4-cell battery, but it has Windows 7 Home Premium already installed which is a great trade-off. I purchased the larger battery from Lenovo and am still waiting for it. I immediately installed the 2GB memory upgrade. It was very easy to do. The hardest part of that process was unscrewing the back. The screws are embedded in the lid and do not come out, so they can't get lost. The old memory card snapped out and the new one snapped in. The system recognized it and I was ready to go. The unit comes with functional versions of MS 2010 Word and Excel. You would have to purchase the full MS Office program if you want all the components. The Natural Touch program may take some getting use to. The Lenovo uses finger touch-a learning curve. I am very happy I can watch movies through an optional portable DVD drive. As soon as I can get to a wireless connection, I will download iTunes and transfer my files. The speakers exist, but the sound through headphones is great. Music sounds good and has good bass. My unit also came with the SIM card option. I will test that at a later date because I am overseas. I put a DecalGirl decal on the outside cover, but they only make them for the S10 and it is not the same size. Still, it is enough to protect the outside cover from scratches and fingerprints until they make one specifically for the S10-3T. If it weren't for the difficulty I'm having in calibrating for finger touch, I would have given this a 5-star rating. The other drawback is it has only 2 USB ports, but I can get around that with a hub. I am going through the programs and getting rid of the ones I don't want. I deleted MacAfee and installed Norton Antivirus. I originally purchased this through Best Buy online but it was on back order indefinitely. I watched the price on Amazon until it dropped to $397 and I bought it quickly. A week later the price jumped up again and stayed high due to high demand. Every store I went to was sold out. If I had known everything about this unit I know now, I would believe it was worth $500 but not more. A netbook should not cost so much. Overall, I'm glad I got this. I travel extensively and this is a wonderful alternative to lugging around a full laptop.", "Date": "August 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "A good product with some annoying issues", "Author": "Joo Y. Chung", "ReviewID": "RLWRJCE2CCE8K", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this computer as a replacement for another netbook. I figured the touch screen would be helpful for taking notes, marking up papers, and the like (I'm a PhD student). At the price, it couldn't be beat -- it was one of the lowest-cost touchscreen / tablet full computer (i.e., just like a regular computer, versus something like an iPad) portables on the market. I find a lot to like about the computer, but also a lot to dislike. Overall, a good value for the price, if you can deal with the minor annoyances.Major parts:- Touchscreen: A nice feature, definitely is fun to use in Microsoft OneNote. Not as useful as I thought it would be, mostly because Adobe Acrobat has terrible support for touchscreen (completely unexpected, for a product touted to be a replacement for paper ...). Occasional problems with deadzones, but these usually go away after cleaning. Slow response, due mostly to Windows 7, plus the fact that the computer is not terribly fast.- Screen / image quality: Could be better, could be worse. It does the job. Poor viewing angles. Image starts looking washed out if you're ten degrees off the vertical, which limits the usability of tablet mode. Also, screen has a slightly warm color cast ... the whites look a little orange-green. You can even it out somewhat with Windows 7 gamma control, but not entirely. Also, aspect ratio is a little off: images are flatter/wider than they should be, in landscape mode. This means in portrait mode, everything is taller/narrower than it should be. Moral of the story: To show pictures of yourself (or your significant other) in the most flattering light, use portrait mode :-)- Keyboard: Nice that the keys are close to full-size. Layout is overall okay, EXCEPT that the lower-left corner key is a FN function key, not a CTRL key as one might expect. The CTRL key is to the right of the FN key. Maybe someone could find a way to remap the keys, then you could swap them?- Touchpad: Overall, usable. Textured surface is nice. Note that there are no real buttons. The lower corners of the pad serve as pseudo-buttons. When you click, the whole pad dips down into the respective corner. Makes it hard to do click and drag, unless you use the tapping mode (but that only really works for left-click ...)Below are small annoyances (some smaller than others):- The fan: This fan is the single most annoying thing about this computer. Of course, when it's off, it's great. But when it's on ... it's super, super loud. And, for some reason, it runs almost all the time. If you can concentrate with a intermittent, usually on, stream of white noise emanating from in front of you, more power to you ... but I find that the fan noise breaks my concentration. It literally makes it hard for me to think. Note, it's almost unnoticeable out of the house, but at home, in my bedroom, where I do most of my work, it sounds very, very loud, at least to me. I thought the fan on my previous netbook (Acer Aspire One) was loud, but the Lenovo takes the cake. If you can not stand loud fan noises, do NOT buy this computer.- Webcam: The webcam gets the job done. But, it's off to the side, which means whoever you're camming with will get a three-quarter view of your face. This is not such a bad thing if the right side of your face is your \"good side\". Potentially disaster if it isn't ... :-)-Battery life: It's a 4-cell, which means it's light, both in terms of weight and power. Realistically, with Windows 7 Home, you're looking at a little under two hours. If you upgrade to an 8-cell, it'll stick out a little, and add about half a pound, bringing the weight up to about 3 pounds even, which is about the same as the weight of the 4-cell plus the AC adapter. I would recommend the 8-cell.- The AC adapter wire is a little on the short side. So in coffeeshops, you'll need to sit maybe a foot closer to a power outlet. I'd suggest just getting an 8-cell battery and leave the adapter at home.Tips:- Buy an 8-cell battery or be doomed to carry your AC adapter everywhere.- Get the 2 GB RAM upgrade if you don't want to spend half your life waiting for Windows 7 to respond to your mouse clicks.- Get a stylus or suffer from a constantly smudged screen. (Note: you need a touch-capacitive stylus. Any that work for the iPad will work.)- When turning the screen to enter / exit tablet mode, ALWAYS apply force to the bottom corners of the screen (near where the buttons on the screen bevel are). NEVER apply force to the top corners, otherwise you may suffer a crack in the screen which will most likely NOT be covered by warranty. Basically, when turning the screen, you want to do so in a way that causes the screen to flex the LEAST, which means applying force as close to the hinge as possible.Overall:- A good value for the price, if you can deal with the minor annoyances.- I personally would not buy this computer again.", "Date": "April 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "A happy compromise!", "Author": "Rhade70", "ReviewID": "R2CTWFPC6F1FDW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Received it in record time from Amazon.com and I'm really happy. If you know what you are looking for then this is a great device for you. Those looking for a cheap Ipad killer should keep waiting. Just get an Ipad when the price comes down or wait for improvements to the bevy of Android tablets that have been coming out of Asia. I wasn't however, looking for an Ipad killer. I was looking for a 7 to 10 inch touch screen device that would bridge the gap between my laptop and my PDA. It's a netbook that converts to a touch tablet. That's it. It's not and is not attempting to be an Ipad. Two different classes of device.I would have preferred the HTC Shift, a true UltraMobilePC, but it's still $750. Though too large to put in your pocket, the Lenovo S10-3t does well being carried in its little sleeve. It's been a conversation piece at the Dr's office.PROS: I needed something large enough to be productive while mobile and access my Windows suit of programs, yet light enough not to cause shoulder strain. The S10 is spot on. Although having the physical key board was a must for Word docs. I rarely use it when web browsing or reading e-books. If I'm using it in bed I can sit it down on my night stand with one hand in contrast to my heavy Dell Inspiron 1501. The touch screen has been surprisingly responsive. Flicks are becoming second nature.CONS: There was plenty of bloatware that I promptly uninstalled (Veriface, Natural Touch, etc). The speakers suck, so you'll need headphones if not in a very quiet place. It's a Windows OS, so even Windows 7 Home Premium gave me a Blue Screen of Death. Had to use OneTouch Recovery to reset to factory settings. Screen rotation could be faster. Has been working quite well though since.My primary use has been web surfing during this summer. However, when school begins. I plan to use it during class to access and annotate lesson plans on the go and to enter student assessment data or observation notes.

I played with the various VeriTouch/VeriFace tools they have like face recognition and touchpad password to log in.  They both work well however, it's faster to just type in the password on the keyboard IMO.  I had a hard time figuring out which RAM I had in order to upgrade it even after opening up the case to look at what was there. To my surprise, I had DDR3 ( Samsung M471B2873FHS - CH9 which is 1GB 1Rx8 PC3-10600 SODIMM ) After research I ordered CT25664BC1339 Crucial Technologies Memory for ~$25usd ( it is a single 2GB module ).

You must make sure you get the right one.My primary laptop is a Core2 DUO P8400 with 4GB RAM running 64bit Windows 7 so....... this Netbook is slow to me but.... it's also 25% of the weight and size....which is why I bought it. I don't expect it to have the horsepower but it was respectively responsive with the 1GB RAM so I expect it'll do slightly better once I get 2GB into it and satisfy the need I had for getting a Netbook.I used the touch pad to draw and scribble in the 'Paint' utility and then with the \"Lenovo Maplife' program which is like a Google Earth application. It did well with both applications in single touch and multi-touch mode like on an iPhone/iPad so, I'm pretty content with the touchpad capability so far. Again, set realistic expectations, it is an ATOM 455 NOT a Core2Duo...it has some lag but it's not unusably slow.Appearance wise....... it is a VERY sharp unit although the top is a fingerprint magnet and the white keyboard..... ( yea, what were they thinking ) is very eye catching but...I see lots of cleaning in the future.All-in-all..... I like my new toy and will REALLY appreciate using it on short business trips instead of my 6+lb laptop.", "Date": "March 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "A little slow...", "Author": "A.

I had the product two weeks when the screen cracked while I was tutrning it to tablet mode. I did not apply any special force it just cracked during normal use. When I called tried to get it fixed under the warranty customer service said screen cracks were not covered and I would have to mail it back and pay to have it fixed at $80 analysis fee, $150 for screen, + labor, $250 - $300 total. That is over half the cost of the computer. I took it to the local service provider and got it fixed for $150. Bottom line - The flip between tablet to keyboard is cool but Lenova is selling a poorly built product and does not stand behind thier warranty.
