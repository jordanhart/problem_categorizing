I was hesitant because I do not buy off brand electronics. I believe in you get what you pay for. I brought it because I needed a basic tablet for work. I don't need to stream videos, play games, etc. Only needed it for emails and notes. Well that was still too much to ask for with this tablet. First problem the speaker is so low at max volume its a whisper. In fact my phone's volume over powered it. Second the tablet has an issue of not waking up when put to sleep. Now its won't load up and the few times it does the ENTIRE Android system keeps crashing-- all programs, all apps. This junk will be returned TOMORROW. Stay away. Buyer BEWARE. Spend the money on a real tablet !", "Date": "May 1, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00FFJ53Z8"}}
