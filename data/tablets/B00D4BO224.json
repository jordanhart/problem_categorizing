{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Kindle Fire HDX 8.9, The best tablet in the market for readers", "Author": "Hussain Ahmadi", "ReviewID": "R1G4NZN44NTGCL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got the this new awesome device recently and its been more than a week that I used it so I\u2019d like to share with you all my thoughts about it. First have to say that I\u2019m an owner of Kindle Fire (1st generation), iPad 2, iPad 3, iPad Air, Google Nexus 7 (2012), Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Samsung Galaxy S3, Kobo Arc and few more tablets that I have used in the past but those mentioned are still being used. So in my review I will be comparing this tablet to the others that I have where necessary.HARDWARE:I have to say that Amazon nailed it when it comes to the hardware of the device. The tablet feels very comfortable in hand, with its rubbery back. but the main attraction here is the gorgeous display. It is so beautiful, very clear and crispy. Even though the Kindle shows a slightly more yellowish whites compared to the iPad Air whites but the colors look slightly better to the eyes on the Kindle than the iPad. at least to my eyes. Tested many pics on both and Kindle had that slight edge when it comes to how pleasant the colors look. I have even read that many professional sites have already declared the Kindle as the more accurate tablet when it comes to colors than the rest, not to forget also that the Kindle is lighter than iPad Air. Another advantage that goes to the Kindle over the rest tablets is the sound, with dual speakers placed at the right places it just gives a very strong and pleasant sound makes your music and videos sound a lot better. The placement of power and volume buttons are odd at first but you will get used to them fast. Cant say much about the camera because I do not use tablets for taking pictures.SOFTWARE:I will write more about the software as I have not seen this enough covered by other reviewers. I will write the things I like and dislike when it comes to the software:Things I like:1- Special offers: yes, don\u2019t raise your eyebrows. I just love it that whenever I want to unlock my Kindle there is something new rather than a boring wallpaper. I find the offers interesting and I hope Amazon show more book ads. they just look gorgeous on full screen.2- The Carousel: Big icons on a high resolution screen look really beautiful and you can remove whatever you don\u2019t want to be there. A nice thing Amazon implemented was the suggestions below the books and apps in the carousel. I find this extremely useful.3- Email: I find myself using this email more than the other tablets for the following reasons. The following points might be small bits but to me they make the Kindle Email superior than the rest:  a- Conversation Mode: Where you see the whole email conversation with a particular account. Yes the iPad also got this but in Kindle it is way more organised.  All the conversation are in one page and you don\u2019t need to click back and forth to read like the iPad, with just one click you can view one and hide rest. really cool.  b- Multiple Selection: Again this is available in all the tablets but it is superior in Kindle\u2019s email. you can select the emails and you can even open one while the the selection is made and all that without erasing your selection. Very very useful. Many times on iPad when I select multiple emails to delete then I decide to check one of them my selection just goes and I have to reselect again. With the Kindle this does not happen anymore.  c- Zooming: This applies to emails written  directly and not within HTML frame or CS. On the iPad when I zoom the text I have then to move the cursor left and right to read the zoomed text. annoying to do that. On Kindle\u2019s email when I zoom the text, the text just gets bigger and fits the page view nicely. No more do I need to go left and right.Really great job Amazon with the email.4- Implementation of Goodreads in the Kindle is the right direction towards making the Kindle tablet a true E-reading device. However, this implementation is not full and lots of things were left. For example you cannot update your reading status of a book. Amazon should address this along with goodreads to make this implementation fully functional so that I don\u2019t need to go to goodreads website from the browser.5- Text to Speech Voices: The text to speech voices on this tablet is the best ever in the market. period. Unlike Apple\u2019s dreadful robotic voice Siri or Samsung\u2019s scary Voice on the kindle provide the most natural human like voices. I love all the four UK and US voices. It is very nice of Amazon to provide different options for the user to choose according to his own likings unlike Apple which only gives us one horrendous voice on the iPad although on its mac OS Apple has so many great voices to choose from.7- Recently opened Apps menu: With the new OS Amazon has introduced the new history menu that could be pulled up from within any application. This makes the multitasking easier and at one finger point.Things I don\u2019t like:1- Book description: This was the major letdown for me with this Kindle. I had to dig and ask a lot to see how I could get to the book description of any book purchased from amazon. First you have to download the book. then open the book, then tab on the three lines on the upper left side to access the left side menu then click on the cover that appears there to see the description. phew!! Come on Amazon you have to do it better than this. on the Kindle Paperwhite you just tab and hold on a cover and the menu shows the book description whether the book is on your cloud or already downloaded to your device. I strongly feel this is a very important thing to us readers as it will make us decide which book to start reading. Amazon should really make the same kind of menu accessible on the carousel as well as in the device and cloud pages of books. THIS IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT. Have to mention that even Amazon\u2019s iOS app lacks this feature while both other e-reading apps like Nook and Kobo have their book description in a very easy and nice way.2- Silk: it is a functional browser with all the basics however what I don\u2019t like about it is that when you have more than two tabs opened the tabs keep reloading as if you were doing a page refresh! Why is that? maybe something need to be done in the settings? no idea but this tab loading is annoying and it prevents me from browsing the net specially when I want to open multiple tabs.3- Sometimes there is a slight lag when going through the carousel and this lag happens particularly when the device downloading something like a book or an app. It should be addressed.4- When I make multiple purchases on my computer and choose the HDX as the device for my books to be delivered to there is something wrong happens. I think sometimes the download in the device gets stuck and i have to remove all the queued book and redownload them again. This happens when I do that more than 10 books at a once. but when in batch it goes smoothly. So Amazon should address multiple book download pushes from other devices to the HDX.5- Text to Speech accessibility: I think all the books that support text to speech should have the play button within. Why do I need to enable accessibility in order for the kindle to read the book to me? This is annoying. I don\u2019t need accessibility enabled. I just need one play button in my book menu for the kindle to read it. Moreover, there is no short cut for accessibility. Not that I know. i have to go into settings and enable it there every time I want kindle to read to me. On iPad there is  the option to press the home button 3 times to enable it. Kindle should use a similar shortcut or even better make the play button available within the books without the need to enable text to speech from accessibility.6- Definition and Speak buttons: While kindle has the definition option within the book it lacks it in the other parts of the OS and apps. on the iPad you can highlight a word and get the option of the definition or the word to be read to you. unfortunately kindle does not offer this feature not even in its Silk browser.7- Sideloaded apps: This is not Amazon\u2019s fault but had to mention it. When you sideload an application the icon of the application looks blurry in the carousel. This has to do with the icon's resolution being not high enough as the apps we get from the Amazon store. Not a big deal but yea it is annoying.So as you can see the things I don\u2019t like are all software based and with the right update and tweaks Amazon can make this great tablet better. Among the things I don\u2019t like I specially find No.1 and No.5 the most that goes in my wish list of being addressed sooner than later.This device is really good. it has so many other good features like the Mayday, Freetime etc but I personally won\u2019t be using them.I also hope Amazon work with Google in future to offer Google apps like Youtube etc on their store. I know there are alternatives but to get the official app is always  better.I find the Amazon Kindle Fire HDX with its ultra HD resolution and great text to speech voices to be THE TABLET any reader should get. You cannot go wrong with it. I prefer it over the iPad Air or mini for reading books. The HDX along with the Paperwhite are winners all the way if reading is the main purpose. I would give The Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 a 4 out of 5. with the right updates that rating should go up. I will update this review in the future the more I use the tablet.", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "4G thru AT&T;?  Please read and save yourself some time!", "Author": "TK1244", "ReviewID": "R87XVGDVM98BY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a christmas gift for my mom.  She lives in a rural area, and I wanted her to have 4G thru AT&T; because my tablet receives great service at her house.  I went through all the push-ups on the new Kindle HDX to add a line to our existing AT&T; account as prompted thru the Kindle.  I received an email with a web order ID and still spent 2 hours+ on the phone (between 3 very friendly and helpful reps and transfers) to get it activated.  Save yourself some time - skip the on board instructions and just call 1-888-444-4410 and go straight to the source for adding a new line with a data plan to your existing service.

If you have doubts shoot me a comment, I can help!HOW IT FARES WITH COMPETITION:The screen size is a bit odd at 8.9\". Every hardware manufacturer seems to have a pet with different sizes.  Three things about the Kindle HDX that are outstanding are  the screen resolution, resolution, and resolution. Stunning is the word to describe it.  HDX  is what Amazon calls beyond HD screen resolution. Sound is also awesome with Dolby Digital Plus audio+dual stereo speaker+microphone. I like the fact that Amazon Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" has a standing Leather Origami case aided with camera assist. Sliding the case triggers camera app.I have seen screens of all the tablets I have spec above and HDX 8.9\" color, contrast, vivid nature of screens definitely outperforms all. This is mainly because of the LCD technology used by Kindle surprisingly beating out  even iPAD air. This has been verified by lot of gadget blogs in gory technical details. Google Nexus model currently in the market is an aging technology (yes, 1 year lot of new things happen in technology).Fire OS 3.0 on Kindle HDX is tightly integrated with cloud, has enterprise software. Fire OS 3.0 is Amazon's forked Android operating system.  It is extremely media centric and cannot be compared to iOS and Android. I feel it is comparing apples and oranges. If you are a media hound, get Kindle HDX. You will not be disappointed. If you are someone who likes to root, hack the OS, develop apps, get the Android. If all you care if design and are immersed in iTunes you know what to get.GENERAL TAKEAWAY:Excellent for browsing/reading emails/reading books. Solid Amazon media devices, this is not a Android tablet. Lot of my friends are confused and have vastly different expectations of Fire HD or HDX.  One thing do bear is mind, Kindle Fire devices are NOT Android devices. Amazon has changed the core of Android front end so that it is significantly different. As long as you understand it and have that in mind, you are good to go. For a large number of people in the world, this does not matter. The UI for example is centered on Amazon experience - books/music/video you have purchased on Amazon. If you live breathe Amazon like me these days, Kindle Fire HDX is plain awesomeness.SCREEN RESOLUTION:Just awesome. Period.SPEED:No issues, I streamed a movie in HD, no stuttering, no stops. It was a smooth experience. The quad-core processor should definitely help. Played few video games, not much heat/issues noticed.MEMORY:On the RAM front 2GB is plenty, no complaints.  However, having no SD card is a bummer for many of the vendors. Apple/Amazon/Google all of them don't have microSD card slot. Can you see a trend. All of them are cloud providers (iTunes/Amazon ecosystem/Google ecosystem) and they will each benefit if you buy books/music/video from them and not bring your own collection onto an SD card. In this respect Samsung is great as you can have multiple microSD cards ($50 for 64 GB) and use it as you wish.EASE OF USE:Very easy to use. It's a Amazon media device. Some people call it a Sears catalog for 21st century. Whatever, the gorgeous hardware makes it easy to consume media. It is a media consumption device. For amazon lovers this is just breathtaking - the interface and the User Experience. Books/Music/Video/E-Commerce absolutely just suits.APPLICATION ECOSYSTEM:Again bear in mind, this has Amazon app store, not Google Play store. What this means to you. Most of Google services apps will be missing-- Gmail, Chrome, YouTube, Google Earth, Google Maps, Google Drive, Google Calendar, Google Translate. Amazon has its own browser/email apps. For someone who has not purchased a tablet before, this is a great start. If you are used to an Android device for several years, this may send you a shock ripple through your spine. So beware of these limitations. Few other missing things obviously include Google Now and Google voice based Navigation (GPS is absent in wifi model, so this is obviously moot, but in cellular models this applies).  Amazon app store has most of prominent apps, so this is not a `big' concern.If you have bought apps in Google Play store, you have to buy them again in Amazon ecosystem - their appstore. All updates takes longer in Amazon to roll out than in Google playstore. Again these may not matter to a general public. People have debated if the absence of Google Playstore is due to Amazon's policy or google's policy of unbranded device. In either case, I feel customers are at a loss.BATTERY:I have not used extensively, so cannot comment. In my several hours of use, I did not find any major issue. Will report as I test for few weeks.USEFULNESS:Very useful if you are in the Amazon ecosystem. It is really lightweight and it is a great strength. Handholding books is not that painful anymore. Watching Prime videos on long road trips is a big plus. The resolution and text is awesome for reading books. It almost feels in a surreal way that the books are more real than a hardcover. X-Ray provides more detailed contextual information for books/music/video. I don't use it that much as I like not to be distracted. Mayday help is also something I have not needed yet. This is mainly meant for new people and it will be definitely a hit with first timers.  Overall I give the Kindle HDX a definite recommend if you are on the Amazon ecosystem.Do ask me questions, I love to answer questions from readers of the review.", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Fire 8.9 HDX exceeded my expectations and equals or beats the Ipad Air in many respects at a cheaper price! Love it Amazon", "Author": "burghboy", "ReviewID": "R9C5FFLFAGFF3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I normally do not post reviews as most of the time I am not that impressed with a product to take the time to write about it in detail.  This is the exception The Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. I have had all of the previous versions of the kindle fires and thought they were good for movies, books, shopping at Amazon & music along with a few apps that were popular, but they lacked the hardware/spec/polish to be a great internet browser and tablet overall.  I have used the Ipad 1 & 2 in the past and even those older versions surfed the net better than the previous Kindle Fires most of the time.  With the addition of all the apps for Ipads and the straight android market it was tough for the older Fires to compete directly as a top quality tablet.  I never bothered in the past to side load apps as I figured it was difficult and a bother and back then I was just using all the apps I needed on my Samsung Galaxy 3 from the android market.  (More on Side loading apps later on the Fire)NOW...the new Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 changes everything that I did not like.  I was able to purchase it at Staples with a $50 off coupon and for $329 I received the 16 gb version that now  come with a charging kit.  The old ones did not.  That is a difference of $170 compared to an $499 Ipad Air 16GB.  Even at $379 it is still a saving of $120.First impression was WoW the amazing light weight of the new tablet...Awesome!  Next the screen is amazing.  When I say that, I mean the best I have ever seen on any tablet including the new IPAD Air (more on that direct comparison later).  I was hoping that these 2 improvements would not be the only thing that was upgraded as the software, apps and processor needed to be drastically improved to compete with the other new tablets coming out.The great news is that the silk browser is much improved as well as the whole operating system.Fire HDX 8.9 vs the Ipad Air I tested the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 against my friends new Ipad Air in surfing the internet 1st. Side by Side i would go to various sites on both tablets to see if there was a big difference in speed.  They were both going over wifi and to my surprise the speed was basically the same (really good). Sometimes the kindle was slightly faster and sometime the Ipad was, but it was so negligible in most cases that I would not even notice it if not comparing them side by side.  The great news to me was that the New Kindle was equal to the new Ipad Air in surfing the net which in the past it was not!My next comparison was to look at the screens while surfing and also watching movies.  The Kindle Fire screen was indeed brighter and clearer in both movies and web sites in almost all cases.  The Kindle Fire's screen is slightly smaller, but for watching movies in HD horizontally they were the same size on both devices because the Ipad has the black bars that limit it on I am assuming HD formatted movies. (I could be wrong in that maybe it is not always the case with the formatting).  The Kindle Fire's coloring, brightness and clarity in side by side streaming movies with the Air was just plain and simple better.  In darker scenes you could clearly make out details on the fire that I could not on the the Air. The Fire's screen looked brighter and clear with great colors that just stood out! I tried several scenes in 2 different movies and the result was always in favor of the Kindle Fire.  I was shocked at the advantage as it was quite a bit better. (the Air has a good screen, just not as good as the new fires!)  Also the Kindle with a Prime Membership lets you download some movies/tv shows for viewing offline later.  It is not all movies/tv shows but there is enough for now to keep you occupied for several trips and hopefully they will continue to add more in the future. They let you chose the standard size or 720 or 1080 but each step up takes up more room on your tablet and takes longer to download.  I have also heard that some have time limits as to how long you can have them downloaded but I have not yet experienced that with the shows I have downloads. (one negative is they do not tell you which movies are downloadable??? So you have no way of knowing until you click on it. Hopefully they will add that to the search option in the future in Prime)  I just also want to mention IMDb for movies is something I thought I wouldn't use much, but I am really starting to like it. It tells you all about any actors on screen and also add's trivia about the movie or scene.  It makes me want to rewatch older classic movies just to learn more about them!Ok, so far the Fire is lighter in weight, with a better screen and the speed when surfing the net was equal!  I am really impressed so far.  Now comes the area that bothered me in the past and almost had me going for an Ipad Air..lack of Apps in the closed off Amazon market.  Now do not get me wrong Amazon has a ton of popular Apps that I am guessing would satisfy 75% of the people who would consider buying a Kindle Fire in the 1st place.  They have all the popular games and apps that most people use.  But they also do not have some that Google and Apple do provide.  For example Amazon had my CBS sports fantasy Football app, but did not have ESPN's fantasy football app. along with Direct TV Sunday ticket! This drove me crazy as I wanted both on my new amazing Fire screen!  So I decided to try to side-load these into the Kindle and they worked! I will not go into that process, but It was relatively easy to do in just a few steps.  This process gives me access to most/all of the android apps!!!  This is a great way to get all the apps you might not find in the amazon Apps store.  I will always use Amazon apps 1st (since they approve them), but then sideload ones they do not have in their store.  This really solves one of the biggest complaints you will hear about the Kindle Fire from techie/experts!  It may take a little work at first to figure out how to sideload the apps, but once you do it is a pretty simple task.Lastly, I just received the OS update 3.1 for the fire and it added Goodreads and also Collections to the Fire.  It added more improvements but I did not have a chance to use the others to this point.  Goodreads is great if you like reading and seeing what others recommend or are reading!  Collections lets you add Books or Apps into Groups which makes it much easier to find things on your tablet.  The apps collections can go right on the Home Screen of the Kindle which is a nice touch that other tablets already maybe have (apple?).  There are other improvements that I will try to come back and update at a later time when I have a chance to use them.In summarizing the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9- It has surpassed my expectations period.  I find it can go side by side with the new Ipad Air in almost every respect and even beat it in screen quality, weight and price $170 less!!!!  You can almost buy the smaller HDX 7inch for that if you catch a sale.  I cannot recommend the 8.9 enough as I am for the 1st time really impressed with the whole package.  It can do everything well and has the screen, processor, OS and price that puts it ahead or at least equal to the new IPAD air.  Amazon with Prime & the HDX 8.9 is a killer combination of great Hardware/Software/2 day free shipping/Apps/Games and finally Great Amazon Support!  The Mayday Button (Help) is amazing. I am pretty good at using technology and I used it a few times to help change a few settings on the tablet instead of searching  for the settings.  The customer service rep. was online in a video box on my table in 20 seconds and help me find the settings quickly.  Another amazing aspect of this tablet is that it is great for novices as well as people who like technology and want to try to sideload apps for example.  I just do not see anything on the market at this price with this many great and unique features that comes close to comparing to the HDX 8.9 Fire.", "Date": "November 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Upgrade, Very Impressed", "Author": "Doug", "ReviewID": "R2YH4OGPQMVU3Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Amazon definitely seemed to try and exude a more premium vibe this year. I think they got a lot of feedback since last year's HD which came in a black box marked Kindle Fire with a pull tab. This time they actually delivered a retail box complete with charger so you got some amount of unboxing pleasure. It did appear as if the tablet was shipped in sleep mode since the first thing I did was attach an Origami case and it woke it up with 4% battery left. Like always it comes pre logged in with your account which is that nice little touch so you're almost able to just run with it. I say almost because you need to get software update first which is pretty par the course for electronics these days.The first thing that you notice when pulling it out of the box is how crazy light it is. Feels much closer in weight to a 7\" than to the 10\" tablets, in fact last year's iPad feels like a tank now. The next thing that was immediately noticeable was the touch response. Note I'm talking about that few millisecond lag between pressing the screen and something happening. Not everyone seems to notice but it's always been an issue with Android that this was a bit long, the HDX doesn't exhibit this and I'm fairly sure this is a software change not just the hardware but either way it just feels really good and really fast. The was especially noticeable on the keyboard. There are no hiccups with the way Fire OS and the SoC handle the UI which coming off N7, Fire HD and older iPads it feels good.The screen is obnoxious. It's probably the best screen on anything really. Realistically the resolution bump isn't noticeable but the color, contrast and brightness sure are. I'm very happy they put a lot of effort into those aspects because it makes it a very well rounded display, it excels at everything. The speakers seem to be the same as the ones in the HD, that is to say the best tablet speakers around. The main difference is they got moved to the top so you don't obstruct them with your grip. Which leads me to another point which is that this tablet really wants to be used in a specific orientation. The camera is the only real indicator so it's easy to mess up, but unlike the KFHD which could be held however the back buttons demand landscape or you can't find them. They are mighty comfortable because you don't have to change your grip to use them when you get there but if you use it in portrait like I like to the volume buttons can be hard to track down. Sleep/wake is solved by getting a case because I immediately attached one and never have had to physically press that button even once.The Fire OS UI has changed a little bit. It still looks the same but things have been tweaked. If you are one of those who hates the carousel you can swipe up to get a grid view (the most recent 10 items are always shown at the bottom). There are more categories of things across the top as games and apps got separated and the recommendations are much smaller (you can still turn those off in settings). There is also a multitasking view if you swipe up from the button bar that is smart enough to multitask between books and media in addition to apps. FireOS 2 had little things that were missing that could make navigation a pain but this version stands on it's own in terms of features and doesn't feel lacking compared to stock Android.I first downloaded all my previous apps from my old KFHD. These are easily accessible from the app menu, you don't even need to visit the store, just go the cloud tab and you have a list of everything you own and just tap on things to download. The rest of my media is mostly in the cloud to save space but the process to download is just as easy. The one thing I had to re-create was my browser settings, those don't seem to cloud-sync. My old HD had a few sideloaded apps that I needed, so the first step was to go to settings and allow installing of 3rd party apps. Then I could go to dropbox.com and get dropbox (because for whatever reason it's not in the store proper), and I also grabbed a few of the latest Google APKs off the web. Installing is simply a matter of downloading the APK and tapping it (no PC required). I couldn't get certain login features to work even with the GoogleLoginService APK but the apps work and I don't need to be logged into to Youtube/Google maps so I didn't bother trying to fix that.Last time I loaded Chrome and Gmail. FireOS 2 had a lousy mail app and the preinstalled Silk kinda sucked (it got an update later than vastly improved it). They've done a lot of work since then to the point where sideloading other things feels unnecessary (I still use Chrome for testing at work but I wouldn't have bothered otherwise). The mail app is basic but does everything I want (read threaded emails and write them). Silk especially has come a long way, this version is branched off Chromium version 25 so while it's missing a few experimental web APIs (Google's WebRTC work) it works with pretty all the latest standards (WebGL included). It also now tells you when it grabbed an accelerated version of a page. Latest Chrome benches better but Silk on an HDX is still faster than Chrome on pretty much any other device.This one also features a rear camera. It's an appreciable 8MP with flash, probably won't replace your smartphone but for a tablet it's actually pretty good. It does better than my 5th gen iPod Touch so if you really need a camera it'll do in a pinch. It has all the normal features you expect, touch-focus, HDR, panorama modes and 1080p video. The camera app is surprisingly good, it comes with a myriad of quick edit features, filters, touchups, stickers, drawing tools, and even a meme-maker. I was expecting a lot less but they put a surprising amount of work into this.Some may be annoyed to learn that this model doesn't feature HDMI out. I wish they kept it because it's cheap and works with everything but Miracast is certainly a better overall option. I got a Netgear push2TV which is the only device specifically cited to work with the HDX right this moment. It's a little box that plugs in to a display via HDMI and uses a USB power source. It's pretty simply but I needed to update the firmware first (otherwise the HDX wouldn't recognize it) which involves downloading firmware from the website, having it create a temporary network and then uploading the file to it. I did this all on the tablet just for proof that you could since that would be a no-no on iOS but Android is pretty flexible and FireOS doesn't take that away. Once that was done I needed to go into setting and set up display mirroring. It's strangely hidden but it was very easy to do once I had my box updated. The output was pretty high quality with about a half second of lag. Note that it seems to squish the 2560x1600 into a 1080p which pillar boxes it and scales it down (even on my 2560x1600 display). I think that's a Miracast limitation or a limitation of the box itself but I think it would probably do the same thing over HDMI. The box was a bit pricey, about $55 and it needs 2 cable but I think as long as Miracast gains traction these should become smaller cheaper dongles that are powered via HDMI. In any case that's what's available right now but it's much more convenient that cables it's just a pity your forced into it for video out. Apparently they'll also have a second-screen app for Playstation consoles that works like a Chromecast as part of Fire OS 3.1 but that's not available yet.The last interesting thing is the Origami case. I couldn't decide if I liked it or not at first but now I definitely do. To be perfectly honest, it has a learning curve. It's very cleverly designed, it can fold into 2 different positions to hold the tablet horizontal or vertical and attaches magnetically. The nice part is is also magnetizes to itself in the folded position which makes it extremely stable compared to other tablet cases but you need to practice a bit to get the folds right because it isn't obvious at first. The Kindle also attaches magnetically which makes detaching it really easy unlike the smart cover for the HDX. This is good because it's a bit heavy and you may not always want it on. Since it folds it's not rigid like the HD's cover so you have to peel it back instead of open it like a book. When you hold it, the magnetic cover swings around and attaches to the back of itself which helpful except one glaring design flaw: it covers the back buttons meaning you have to lift it up to use the volume buttons (sleep/wake is handled by the magnetic attach points so it doesn't matter). Also when vertical you can only use it rotated right as the USB cord will obstruct in left rotation position. The final nifty little thing is you can push the HDX up in the case. This is because the camera isn't exposed but when you push it up it clicks into a position and this automatically launches the camera app no matter what you where doing, though sometimes is can take a couple seconds depending on if the app was hibernated. I really like this feature and really wish more things incorporated a quick camera feature like it. It just makes it that much easier to capture something in the moment. So it has some highs and some lows but I definitely recommend it, it's just a lot to take in for what you'd expect was a simply case. It did set me back $55 for a black, polyurethane though with an even more expensive leather one above that.After messing around with it for a whole day I was barely breaking 80% on the battery meter. At the current rate it will likely fall around the 10-12 hours Amazon advertises. Apparently when reading that number can jump to 18 but I'm not much of a tablet reader so I probably won't test that. The initial charge took maybe 3-4 hours to go from 4% to 100%.If you thought Amazon was just putting out cheap tablets I'd encourage you to take another look as this is a whole different beast that the KFHD (which itself was a massive step from the original). If the Kindle was a cheap tablet and the HD was a budget tablet with nice hardware this is very premium hardware that happens to be cheap. I was disappointed that they raised the price $80 but they definitely made that $80 go a long way. Spec-wise it's an iPad killer but it's still a lot cheaper which is what I like about it. I'll admit I don't really care much about tablet apps and games, I use my tablet for looking things up, reading email/social media, music, videos, web-surfing and web development. I also use Amazon a lot so this was really a no-brainer and if you're anything like me (a tech-slobbering deal-hunter who realizes the futility of convergence) I'd say it's a must-have. So I'm very happy with what they put out this year, it feels like a big step up from the HD.I gave it 4 because Amazon still has some catch-up to work on with their app store and basic apps.  I'd really like to see speech-to-text options as well as better syncing of browser options . I'd really like to see better mapping software options since Amazon does have their own API but strangely don't use it themselves.  The HDX doesn't have a compass or GPS on the wifi version unlike the Nexus 7 and a myriad of other dirt cheap tablets which I think this is a huge oversight.  But the final thing is the lack of update support.  I was highly disappointed with the way the original and now HD have been treated as far as updates go.  If Bezos says we're not on the upgrade treadmill then please port some of those features back and give my old device new life.  At some point it's okay to move on but when your new HD has software features last-year's didn't and the internals on the 8.9 HD are still better that's highly problematic.", "Date": "November 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Impressed, and will probably only get better.", "Author": "Jeremy Roper \"perpetual student\"", "ReviewID": "R1TUUELO41U604", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've put about 12 hours of use into my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 (with 64 GB and Wi-Fi only) at this point and am very satisfied. I've been interested in the Fire since launch but have held off because of lack of storage space (I want my music collection on it, which alone is over 30 gb, for one thing).I know there's been some irritation about it not being the same as Android. They never advertised it that way, and I think that shows a lack of effort to actually learn about the product before you spend hundreds of dollars on it. There are similarities to Android, but this OS is truly distinct. Amazon has always been geared toward media consumption, so it should come as no surprise that this is a media consumption device (I mean, really, that's what Kindles have been from the very beginning). It seems misguided to be bothered because of uninformed expectations. If you're looking for something other than media consumption, look elsewhere. But buying something like this without doing some research first? That doesn't make sense at all.I want to give this 4.5 stars, but that's unfortunately not an option, and it doesn't quite warrant 5 stars (yet, at least). I've used multiple Kindle devices and almost every Apple product, as well as Android phones and tablets and feel I have a pretty good foundation for comparison. The HDX 8.9 falls in a category of its own. Overall, I'm almost entirely pleased, and have only run into a few hiccups, mostly with the software. I'll explain the hiccups first to get those out of the way, then discuss what I love. Will update if necessary.***Not so great:- I got an error when it attempted to update during setup, and didn't think to do it right away (my fault). This may have prevented some of my problems, but not sure.- The software was a bit slow initially, which was disappointing because it's advertised as among the fastest of tablets (if not THE fastest). For example: App store, cloud music player (more on this later), adjusting settings, and viewing a PDF (the first I tried; the others were flawless). I was in the same room as my router, and I have reliably fast internet, so it's unlikely to be a Wi-Fi or connection issue.- The music player. I want all my music on the device, which is currently in the cloud so I tried downloading it. I couldn't find an apparent \"download all\" option, so I had to queue it artist by artist for about 10 GB before I went to bed. It was late and I didn't try Mayday, but I probably will when I get home. In addition, it was very slow and has frozen a couple of times when I try to load my music library, and ended up restarting. This may be an initial \"indexing\" thing, especially since I have a fairly large library. It took about 20 minutes to finally access what I had downloaded last night. Now, however, the problem is resolved. -- ***UPDATE on this in comments***- The App Store seems a bit cluttered.- The display flickered 3 times in the first 30 minutes, but never since.What I love:- The screen is phenomenal. It's fun to look at just because it's so pretty. No \"blue haze,\" so maybe they were able to address that before this model shipped. I've tried to see it but just can't. Touch response is excellent as well; sensitivity and accuracy are top-notch.- Processing speed is excellent, except for the few problems I initially experienced, which seem to be resolved.- The media bar along the top is great; unlike Android or iOS, I don't have to go search in the menu for the different content apps.- Sound is fantastic. I've never heard speakers on a tablet that even come close. It's better than a lot of laptops. Wired and bluetooth headphones have great sound as well.- Keyboard: this might be a weird one, but especially after discovering Swype I've been very disappointed with traditional touch keyboards. I was holding onto a faint hope that Swype would be available and am very pleased it is.- Wi-Fi speed is better than any mobile device I've used. Bluetooth seems to work without a hitch as well.- Cameras are clear and responsive. I hate the way my phones always take about 3 seconds to actually take the picture. Not an issue with the HDX 8.9.- Interface: I took a step back from what I was used to with Android, as I knew this wouldn't quite be the same. With that in mind, I am very pleased.- Prime Video works well and downloads relatively quickly. I'd like more selection but I also took the time to learn that they have a limited selection currently, which they're working on expanding.- Battery life appears to be as advertised. It's perfectly satisfactory, but after I run the battery down I'll update if necessary. Turn the Wi-Fi antenna off when you're not connected and it stretches a bit further. **UPDATE** - Finally ran the battery down from full charge to 15% after 12 hours of continuous use mixed between email, streaming video, web browsing, and LOTS of time downloading music from the cloud. Battery life impresses me well enough.- Integration with Prime features. I love that my Prime membership keeps going further and further beyond free 2-day shipping.- Little-to-no bloatware (depending on how you define it). I hate my android phones for this reason.- The price is incredible. I though a few times about an iPad Mini (w/ Retina) or iPad Air, but I could buy a decent new laptop for that price. Not looking to wipe out my savings for a tablet.Wish List/So-so features:- More customizability in settings. The collections option that they're supposed to roll out soon would be nice. I'd love an EQ adjustment in music and video as well - not all songs/videos/speakers/headphones are created equal.- Get rid of the matte finish on the back. Personal preference.- Not in love with the carousel home screen, though I may change my mind.- Smoother experience downloading music and videos - particularly music.- Better app selection. Most essentials are there, but hopefully this will expand.- I'm interested in the Second Screen feature. I can already play Amazon content on my TV, so hopefully this is something where I could send any content on the device to the screen. If not, I'll find it less than impressive.***I consider the iPad a media consumption device -- it grew out of the iPhone and iPod Touch, which sprang from the classic iPods, and they were all designed for media use. I think that's the HDX 8.9's closest competitor.  Aside from having more apps (not surprising if it was the first major device and has at least a three-year head start on the Fire) and being trendy from the start, I don't think the iPad has much of a leg up on the HDX. This device is faster and lighter, with an amazing display and a price substantially lower. Android was designed for more variable use, so go there if you want to do more work than play on your tablet. If I'm going to work much, I will do it on my laptop, which is really not much bigger.Altogether, I love my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. It would be 5 stars if it weren't for a few bumps I've run into so far.

I'm heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem, but I really needed a good e-reader and a good tablet for school. The iPad is a great tablet, but I kept seeing people saying that it wasn't a great e-reader. As an apple user, I can't deny that my eyes are always feeling strained while reading on my Macbook Air for long periods of time, so I started looking at other products. I'm really glad I went with the Kindle because is a big improvement for reading.Operating system: It is also extremely simple to operate and I haven't had any issues learning how to use the Kindle. In fact, it makes the apple IOS look extremely complicated-- which it isn't.Battery Life: It kills my Macbook Air. Destroys. Murders. Whatever adjective that means the Kindle's battery is way better. I can average 4-6 hours on my laptop off the charger, but the Kindle will last all day with mixed use.Size: I'm really glad that I went with the 8.9. It's bigger than the iPad mini, but I felt like the Kindle 7 would be too small. Even though I have small hands, the Kindle 8.9 is not too big and definitely not too heavy-- it's extremely light even with the (poetic) cover attached. I can easily hold it in one hand while reading. It's also a good size for watching movies and it's still perfect for playing games. The only downside is typing-- unless you have BIG hands or you like to peck--- use your computer!Reading: It has all the features of the Kindle e-books (highlighting, translation, search functionality, notes), but it is an LCD screen so it's not backlit like the paperwhite. However, my eyes seem to be fine with it especially with the abundant reading options. For instance, I was reading in the evening and as it got darker my eyes started to feel tired. I simply changed from a white to a black background and my eyes immediately felt better. Reading is SO MUCH BETTER than my Macbook Air. There are LOTS of books to choose from (including many free books)-- I've downloaded nearly two dozen books and I've only paid for 3 of them. Yay!Movies and Audio: No lag, excellent picture quality. Some people have said they haven't been able to get all the movies they've wanted to see, but I haven't ran into anything I can't watch... yet. There are a good selection of Prime videos you can watch for free and also cheap rentals. X-ray is pretty cool.The sound is EXCELLENT. Seriously, surprisingly good.Apps and Games: A lot of people seem to complain about the lack of apps, but everything I wanted was available and all but one of them were FREE. Granted, I do like a lot of the more popular apps (pinterest, facebook, evernote), so if you want something really specific then it may not be there. As for games, I got Angry Birds Rio for free and the response time is excellent. We also Real Racing 3 (Free) and the graphics were awesome and it was easy to play with no lag.Internet: The responsiveness to open pages is initially slower than my Macbook Air, but it isn't a huge difference. It seems to improve the more you visit the site. You have options to use different browsers: google, bing, and a few others. I'm a google addict so I didn't really look at anything else.Shopping: Strangely enough this is where I was disappointed. I was trying to find an e-book and I could get to the main shopping page which would show all the books in the series, but when I clicked on the book I wanted the page would just never load. The tablet did not freeze-- I could backspace out of the loading process. I restarted the Kindle, and I waited around, but this is still the case 24 hours later. I ended up buying the book on my computer and linked it to my kindle. This also happened when I was looking at movies-- it just kind of refuses to upload certain pages in the Kindle Store, but most have no problem.Camera: I never intend on using the camera, but I did just for you. It's surprisingly good. Definitely comparable to my iPhone with both the front and back cameras. It is no where near the level of my Lumix camera (thank good-- I spent too much money on it!), but it's definitely respectable.Mayday: Beats me. I haven't had to use it.I am really happy that I bough this instead of the iPad mini or Air and I saved myself a butt load of money.

What the heck is it? What's different between it and every other android-based tablet out there? Why should I buy it? Hopefully I can give you a less \u201ctechnical\u201d perspective on the differences between android tablets and the Kindle Fire HDX and why you would or wouldn\u2019t want to buy one! Let's cover the highlights:What is it?- It's a tablet...based off the android platform but running Amazon's proprietary firmware. What does that mean? It means you can run android apps but they have to be purchased through the amazon app store and not the Google play store (which isn't available on a Kindle Fire).Pros:- The screen is amazing, hands down the best I\u2019ve seen in a long time.- Battery life is decent, however standby time could be improved (a week at most).- Integration with the Amazon app store and Prime instant video was very seamless and easy to use.- The interface is surprisingly easy to navigate, although there are some inconsistencies (ie. the back button moving between apps) that could be improved with software updates.- Memory and CPU were actually quite spectacular and should provide enough horsepower to last you at least 4-5 years.- At 13.2oz it\u2019s incredibly light but yet still feels durable in your hands. The anti-slip coating on the back helps to ensure you don\u2019t accidentally drop it, although a protective case is still a good idea!- MAYDAY!!! Actually quite a cool feature. If you ever have trouble finding something, running something, or just need help using your HDX, Mayday connects you directly to an Amazon rep who can help.Cons:- No Google apps or Google features (only a problem if you\u2019re mobile world is heavily influenced by Google; pictures, contacts, etc)- Although very minor, the interface can provide some confusion on where things are located. Ie, \u201cHome\u201d, \u201cBack\u201d, \u201cSettings\u201d, etc.What's the difference between this and other android tablets?- The biggest thing...amazon controls the software, the updates, and the apps you can install. It's easiest to think of this as a tablet devoid of anything \"Google\" that loves to play in the realm of \u201cAmazon\u201d. This isn't really good or bad; it just depends on how you see it and what you're used to (keep reading).Google versus Amazon:- Originally when the Amazon app store launched you were hard-pressed to find all the apps found in the Google store. But, now that the Amazon app store has taken serious leaps forward you can pretty much find any app you\u2019re looking for. However, I strongly recommend that you look through the Amazon app store (Shop by Department -> Amazon App Store) FIRST to make sure any specific apps you\u2019re needing are there before you purchased a Kindle HD/HDX. You may have that one unique android app that\u2019s only available in the Google play store.- If you\u2019re use to the world of Google (Contacts, Apps, Photos, Syncing, etc) then a Kindle HDX may not be right for you\u2026if you want an Android tablet to complement your Android device collection (Phone, Tablet, etc). Having used Android phone since v1.1, I found that there were things I wasn\u2019t getting with the Kindle HDX that I would have wanted. Thing like \u201cAutomatic Contacts sync\u201d, \u201cPicture syncing\u201d, etc. Not that these are deal breakers, it just I would have preferred to have consistency between all my devices. However, Amazon does offer cloud backups for photos and contacts, however, if you have an Android phone before a kindle, you may find yourself frustrated with having to manage two separate contact lists and photo collections. All in all, if you\u2019re use to the Google way of handling things, using Amazon\u2019s apps may prove to be frustrating and monotonous.Summary:- All in all this is a beautiful tablet and completely different from the first Kindle Amazon created. While it harkens back to the Kindle days, it\u2019s best to look at this tablet as a complete redesign of the whole kindle \u201cexperience\u201d. While the lack of Google features (pictures, contacts, etc) can provide some headache, the seamless integration of Amazon\u2019s Video streaming, Lightning Deals, App Store, and Kindle apps makes it surprisingly simple and easy to use. At 13.2oz it\u2019s incredibly light but yet feels sturdy in your hands. Battery life is great considering the CPU and Video resolution and the quality and color of the screen certainly makes it one of the top \u201cMost Beautiful Screens to Look At\u201d. If you\u2019re use to Google\u2019s ways of handling things (pictures and contacts), the Kindle HDX will most likely be best suited as an E-book reader, occasional Prime Instant Video watcher, and large screen gaming device. If you\u2019re new to the Google world, making the transition to using Amazon\u2019s cloud-based apps probably won\u2019t be that difficult!

Let me be clear- if anyone at Amazon is reading this-  I PURCHASED the content and it belongs to me.  I did not \"rent\" the right to view it at your convenience.

There has been so much written about it, so a full review is excessive, but these are my quick thoughts.First, the hardware is as advertised.  Right now, it's simply the most powerful and beautiful tablet available.  It's fast and images are gorgeous.  Text has laser printer like clarity.  Movies look great, and the sound, wow.  The Dolby audio is something to hear.  No joke, on the first movie I watched on my new HDX, there was a bird in the background, and I honestly started looking around the room for it.  It is excellent.Seconds, the FireOS is actually pretty good!  I'm a fairly knowledgeable android ROM tinkerer, but I don't see any real problems with the FireOS, at least nothing that has me actively looking to fix it.  It's a pleasantly surprising modded Android experience.  Plus, there are some real benefits of keeping it stock and using your Prime membership.I owned the Fire 1.0 and sold it pretty quickly.

It's great.  I was looking for something as flexible as possible, but I really wanted to have a good video service for off-line viewing as well as on-line.  I wanted something that I could use in the gym, moving vehicles, etc.  I checked out various tablets before making my decision and I definitely made the right one.  People in stores don't know much about Amazon's products and really only want to sell iPads and other Android tablets, especially Samsung.  The Samsung Galaxy note is a great tablet, but no other video service is as good as Amazon's and you can't get it on other Androids.  I have watched videos via both streaming and after downloading and it works really well both ways.  I've streamed video at home where I have 30 MB/sec service and at a place with about 1 MB/sec service and was surprised at how well it worked even there. I have a Prime membership, and that makes the Fire even better.  It was very easy to set up my home email on it and that works well too.  The Silk browser works well and so far I've experienced no problems as a result of it not supporting Flash.  If a website has small type, you can zoom with a stretching motion with your fingers as with some other tablets.  We have a 2013 Samsung smart TV and the second screen feature works exactly as advertised - pretty cool.  I haven't tried the WiDi/Miracast feature yet and also haven't tried to import other music yet, but will do so soon.  The battery lasts as long as they say.  Also have the origami cover and like it a lot as well.  I've briefly tried Officesuite Professional 7, but so far only to view a Word document (docx) and that worked fine. Personally, I'd much rather use a laptop for any serious work than any tablet on the market, but at least this gives some ability to work if you need it.

I find the interface design perfectly suited for both the size and functionality of the kindle.  I have the 8.9\", 64gb ad-free version. Opening/closing apps, browsing the Internet, reading, etc respond extremely fast to the touch. I have had a really hard time picking up my ipad since purchasing the HDX (I write this review on the ipad, however, due to my wife reading on the HDX). We also bought the hardback/leather flap case as well, which fits on in seconds, no fumbling with clipping it in place, and is equally easy to remove if necessary. I find this to be a fantastic product; not only is it well worth the purchase price (it feels to me like you get more than what amazon just advertises about it) but also the time invested in using this devise since we've had it! I would highly recommend this to anybody who's looking for a different tablet to try, as well as anyone who uses Amazon's services (prime, streaming video, cloud, etc); I've found their interaction through the kindle HDX to be quite enjoyable.

This is the first HD device I've owned and it makes a huge difference.  I browsed the web, read books, etc. and it felt and looked great.  I then picked up my iPad 2 to do some similar things and it was blah.*Speed and smoothness!  It's much speedier and smoother than any of my other devices.*I actually like the OS.  Quick access to most used apps, recently used apps, and content tabs on one page.  It's very different from iOS and Android which use folders and pages to organize apps and content.*Having it tapped in to the Amazon ecosystem is great (I'm a prime member).Cons:*My device has rebooted 7 or 8 times for reasons I can't figure out.  Some reboots were before I loaded any other apps and some after.  I've had reboots opening settings, silk, and camera app.  Some happened while I was in the middle of a show or listening to music.  Kind of frustrating.*This one doesn't bother me as much, but there's a slight flicker to my screen when going from a white background to a darker like the home page.  It's like it's trying to dim down as if it was doing an auto-brightness adjustment and finally settles (I never use auto, I just manually change brightness if I feel like I need to so I can better conserve battery).*App selection is limited and at least one app, Splashtop one of my faves, doesn't work as well as on iOS and Android.Neither Here Nor There:*There is no quickoffice app that gives you editing abilities like I thought there would be (I read all of the product info I just misinterpreted it.  Why advertise office \"reading\" software as a perk, right?  So I just assumed.)  This didn't bother me much as I've always used and even prefer Kingsoft Office which is free and works just fine on the hdx.*There is no Youtube app and Youtube on the Silk browser stinks.  The videos look worse than on my low res iPad 2.  However, I found a tolerable third party app that gets the job done.I am keeping an eye on it and I'd be interested to know if anyone else has experienced any of my cons.

I am not a fan of the Apple ecosystem so the iPad (mini or other) was out of the question. My wife as the 2nd generation Kindle Fire and loves it...me not so much. It's good for what it does, but I'm not a fan of the Kindle overlay on top of the android OS. I had a feeling that this newer version would be similar, but I wasn't sure so I decided to give it a test drive.First let me say that this tablet is super light-weight! It makes my Xoom feel like a 10lb dumbbell. Not only is it light, but it is very thin (maybe even thinner than the iPad Mini). The tablet is super fast and smooth. There was absolutely no lag as I switched between screens and apps. Surfing webpages was effortless and there was little to no load times. The tablet is an excellent media device and I would definitely recommend it to anyone that is already using or thinking about signing up for Amazon Prime.Well why 4 stars then?! As with the original Kindle Fire and all of it's newer versions, I just can't get into the customized layout that Kindle has ontop of Android's OS. I am one of those people that absolutely hates the \"Kindle Carousel\"! I much prefer a clean and simple interface that I can customize to my liking.I would give the tablet 4.5 stars, but that wasn't an option.

This is the 6th Kindle we've owned in our family.  Our first foray into the Kindle world was the original Kindle Fire.  After that we purchased 2 of the second generation Kindle Fires and then I purchased a Kindle Fire HD 7inch.  We also have a basic Kindle e-reader.  Now, I've finally gotten the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me.....the 8.9 HDX.  I'm not a techno whiz by any means, so I can't tell you about all the bells and whistles this little baby has.  What I can tell you is that it is super user friendly and almost absurdly easy to use.  This tablet is now my primary means of surfing the web, watching videos, checking email, as well as reading.  It's like an all in one entertainment center.  I love the bigger 8.9 screen.  The additional ability to categorize my books into collections is awesome!  I have so many books, I often overlook ones that I've yet to read.  Furthermore, when I'm in the mood for a particular type of book I would have to search through my entire library to figure just what to read, and then oftentimes I'd forget whether a specific book was of the genre I was looking for.  Now that I've organized my books by genre, I no longer have that problem.  I love it!  My only complaint is that, while I am still able to review a book directly after reading it on my tablet, Amazon has removed the ability to edit the review once it's been submitted.  So many times after I submit a review I realize, after rereading it, that I've made some grammatical error.  Now because I am no longer able to edit the review once it's submitted, I have to go online via \"Silk\" and find my review in order to do the editing.  It is a bit of a pain in the....., but not overly so.  Otherwise, this tablet is just about perfect.  My husband has an Ipad and I would not give up this tablet for that one EVER!

Finally, this December my hubby and I ordered one as my Christmas gift. Christmas day I pulled it out of the box and everything worked perfectly. However, early January I went to turn on my new Kindle in the morning and nothing. Dead. I followed the suggestions given on the Amazon website, but to no avail. Called customer service, and they end up sending me a new Kindle. I was truly bummed that my new device was faulty, but Amazon's customer service was excellent!So, after playing with my second Kindle and reading other reviews, here are my thoughts on this device.1. I love most everything about this Kindle, the light weight, the features, etc. Things that drive me a little crazy include the fact that the power and volume buttons are on the back.  It is awkward to feel around for the volume button while you are watching a video or whatever.2. Mayday is helpful but a little creepy. So, I was trying to figure out how to open Word documents that were sent as attachments via email. I had purchased the OfficeSuite Professional App and had no problems opening documents sent via Yahoo mail, but couldn't figure out how to use it for Gmail. I pushed the Mayday button and right away had a customer service rep online. He walked me through the issue. At first I thought \"This tech is so cool. He can see/control everything on my Kindle,\" followed by, \"Oh, that is kind of creepy.\" Not that this is any different then was Dell or any other computer customer service can do with your permission on your computer, it just struck me a little weird. BTW, contrary to other reviews, you can open email attachments on this Kindle from both Yahoo and Google mail servers.3. I love the video quality when watching something on this device, but not sure why they did not include an HDMI outlet so that you could watch on other devices, like your TV.4. Having Amazon Prime is definitely worth it, you just need to be aware of its limits. We have had Amazon Prime for years and use at least one of its features almost daily, whether it is free shipping, the free movies/TV, or checking out a free book from the Kindle collection. Amazon's new feature lets you download some (that should be capital SOME) Primes movies and TV programs.5. I have yet to find a cover/case that I really love for this device. I have the Amazon Origami case and the MarBlue Ultra Lightweight Origin Case for Kindle Fire. Neither have all the features I am looking for, like really good protection. If you have any suggestions I would like to hear them.6. I will probably continue to read books mostly on my Kindle keyboard e-reader. I work on a computer during the day. When I go to read at night I find the back-lit screens really bother my eyes. I have read on this Kindle just fine, but I prefer the size and screen of my Kindle e-reader for long stretches of reading.7. I would recommend setting up some parent controls, even if you are the only one using your Kindle. Once you turn on the controls you can go into the settings and choose the controls you want to use. For example, I want my Kindle to ask for a password before a purchase is made or a video is watched, just in case I accidentally hit a button or my kids happen to be using it.8 If for any reason you have to return your Kindle, I was  told by a customer service rep to deactivate the Kindle from your account for security reasons, even though the first thing Amazon does it delete all information on returned Kindles.9.

High resolution, fast and compatible with most of the apps on our cloud. We love it. We love having our books, movies (prime), music, games and apps all on the cloud. All accessible to our devices and smart phones.EmotionWe love it. By \"we\" I mean me, my wife and our 5 year old daughter, who has been using it since she was 3. She would have been using it earlier but we didn't have one.ConstructionIt is very thin, very fast and elegant. More-so than the HD version. The original Fire, which is highly functional, seems very primitive by comparison. Now one of our original Fire's broke. Amazon was kind enough to give us $75 credit on it. For this we are very grateful.FunctionalityMy wife is a Database developer and has resources that help her with her job.I am a musician. I have wonderful books, a 4 track mixer, can write notes, take video notes... browse the web, run apps, games, movies. it is beyond my wildest dreams and I am very impressed. At this stage in my life it takes a lot to impress me, but this has a lot.My daughter has tons of games (minecraft, reading apps, etc) that she adores. The worst thing is we have strive to limit her. Now the kindle will do that for us, but we still reserve the right to do that. She's very careful with her \"Piggy\" as she calls it. This is based on an early application (2 years back) that featured a \"Piggy\". Well, she loves it. We all call our kindles \"Piggies\" because of this.LongevityI don't know how it will hold up. I pray it will last years. I can see using it for years if it does. I can't imagine what Amazon's engineers will come up with in the coming years. It's yet another reason to fight to stay alive. I am amazed by technology. I rank this right up there with innovations such as the Kemper and almost the cell phone. It's just amazing and a game changer. IMHO, easily the leader in it's field.Tech SupportAmazon's tech support is top notch and second to none. They make a mistake they'll break their backs to fix it. If carriers make a mistake they do their best to make it right and then some. They don't have to, but this reinforces good-will and makes us come back to them time and time again. We love amazon. This product is tied to amazon and their success and quality shines through in this product. They deserve all of their success.Originality and other tabletsThere are many tablets on the market. The key competitor is the iPad and the two are very comparable. The iPad's keys to success are it's larger screen and it's elegant programs. It's weakness is it's cloud is too proprietary compared to the Kindle. I have two iTouches and like the elegant, well designed programs, but dislike iTunes. The Kindle beats the iPad in every other department. The Kindle HDX is less expensive, the programs are usually on par or close to Apple, and the resolution is actually higher on the HDX. The HDX also boast a faster quad core processor. This might be negated by the higher resolution of the Kindle but the difference is negligible.VerdictBoth. I would be happy with an iPad and a Kindle. If I had to choose one it would be the Kindle. Amazon has found a way to worm themselves into our lives and our hearts. Their relatively low priced kindle, great shipping, excellent selection of everything has done it. They are part of our culture with south park making episodes based on UPS/Amazon deliveries and so forth. It's a huge deal and probably the beginning of something larger than we can imagine.

If you want the tech specs, you can read them on the page for the tablet. So I won't repeat them here. I have and have had a number of tablets including the iPad AIR, iPad 3rd gen, iPad 7\", Nexus 7, Nexus 7 2nd gen, Galaxy Note, Galaxy Note 3, Galaxy Note 8, and an Asus 10\" (I don't remember the model). So I am very familiar with the different models and operating systems.I had a Kindle Fire Hd 7\" that I sold because I didn't like the carousel, and getting to apps that I wanted to used wasn't convenient. The color, resolution, and sound were fine for my purposes to watch Amazon movies and to uses some apps, but it was cumbersome as compared to other android tablets that I had. Apps couldn't be grouped or organized as they could be on other tablets, and every app used was added to the carousel making the carousel lengthy and virtually useless.I decided to give the Kindle Fire HDX a try in hopes that some of the disappointments I experienced with the Fire HD were resolved. I have had the Kindle Fire HDX only a couple of days, but so far, I am impressed with the improvements. It still has the carousel, that can be useless if you use a number of apps or new apps are added - all are added to the carousel. Those that you don't use often have to be remove, one-by-one, manually. It would be nice if adding apps to the carousel was an option so that only most used apps could be added. (Hint to Amazon).On the plus side, you can now view all of your installed apps and execute them by swiping up in the screen. You can also group your apps into collections, or folders, and name the folders. In addition, apps in the apps view can be arranged in a way that makes sense to you by dragging and dropping them into position. In this matter, the Kindle Fire HDX function much more like other android tablets and is a huge improvement over previous versions of the Kindle Fire. This versions offers much more user control for organization and usage of the tablet.A couple other improvements that are obvious to me are the resolution and the crisp true colors. The colors on the screen really do \"pop\". In comparison to other tablets that I have, the touch response is extremely good, and the accuracy of the on-screen keyboard has been flawless. In addition, moving from the carousel to the apps screen and going from one app to another has been very smooth. There is no lag at all.I did have an opportunity access Mayday, that is reached by clicking the \"?\" icon. I used this at 3am, and go almost an immediate response. The representative was very helpful and answered all of my questions. I did find out that many of the Google apps are not compatible with the Kindle Fire HDX because developers have not made them compatible. They hope that this will change with future updates to the OS. In my experience, developers of apps have most developed the iPad apps and then the Google apps. The Google apps never seem to be quite as good as the iPad apps. Now that Amazon has developed  a very capable tablet, maybe developers will start to create more apps that are compatible. This is yet to be seen. In the meantime, users of the Kindle tablets are pretty much limited to apps available on Amazon other than a few Google apps that may be compatible.At this point, I would recommend the Kindle Fire HDX tor android flexibility, the improved display, and for use with Amazon Prime deals.

We purchased both of our Kindle Fire 8.9's with 32 GM of memory, without the special offers feature.We want to emphasize that the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 is a very fine tablet, and if you do not have the extra funds to purchase the HDX 8.9, you should purchase the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 while they are still available from Amazon for $229. The two are very close in the quality of still and video graphics. At this price, they are an incredible bargain.Nevertheless, we were very pleased (amazed might be a better term) by the new Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. In the following commentary, keep in mind we are comparing the HDX to the HD 8.9.The new HDX 8.9 is noticeably lighter to hold, yet retains the solid build quality of the original 8.9. As far as still graphics are concerned, the colors are more vivid, contrast is even higher, blacks appear even blacker. In short, the display is amazingly impressive!  Comparing the two tablets side by side, it is as if the original image is being viewed through a very slight polarizing filter on the original HD 8.9.As far as viewing Video content, we noticed very little difference between the two tablets, with the original KF HD 8.9 perhaps having a slight edge. Both are excellent, movie picture quality varies widely. If you are a Prime member, try The Robe, or Contact if you want to see just how good the video quality truly is. The soundtrack on Contact showcases the sound quality possible with these tablets.The rear/back facing camera is fun to use, color is quite accurate. The camera is effective in relatively low light situations with low \"noise\". If high picture quality is required, we would recommend using your digital camera.The sound quality seems to be slightly better on the new model, which might be due to the altered position of the dual speakers. If you are watching a movie, you will definitely want to use high quality lightweight headphones. With these, the sound quality is very impressive.The New Silk browser is greatly improved.  Internet browsing is significantly faster with snappy response.Battery life is significantly improved, we noticed at least a 20% increase in useable battery life.Overall, the new Kindle FIre HDX 8.9 has managed to improve an already excellent screen image,  provide slightly better sound, added a useful rear/back facing camera, while being significantly lighter in weight.There really isn't anything we would describe as being negative with this tablet. Some icons, apps, and text appear slightly smaller in size because of the increased screen resolution, and one of our apps did not run properly on the new Kindle fire. If a reset is required, one must now depress the power button for a full 20 seconds, release, and repress the button to allow the kindle to reset. We only experienced one lockup requiring a reset, which we are sure was software related.If Amazon is still offering the four payment plan, there is no better time to purchase or upgrade. If not, we still are impressed enough to spend the full $444 for the 32G KF HDX 8.9, without special offers. (If you opt for 16GB and special offers, the price is less).

But for being a primary book reader for their kindle books, there are a couple of serious flaws for the dedicated kindle reader that enjoys the digital version as well as the audio version. With their \"Immersion Reading\" `which isthe digital book along with the professional narration; I get skips in the highlighting and the highlighting not keeping up with the narration; seems to depend on the book and/or the size of the text you've selected; also if you're reading in double columns or not.Text To Speech;Even tho they have now included 6 voices only 2 of these are US English; Amazon needs to have many more choices and better quality voices like the Neospeech voices. The Text To Speech is also flawed in that it will skip pages (not the audio); the written text will skip ahead of the audio; it's a pain then to page back because you have start all over at the beginning of the page; sometimes it will get halfway into a page; then the page will jump to the next page or even 2 pages ahead.I have talked to Mayday and have also talked to their regular support staff about these issues. Nobody knows what to do about these or how to fix them.They need to have highlighting with the Text To Speech and better highlighting where you can change the colors of the highlighting.I had the HD also (the 2012 Kindle Fire); I had the same problems with it.Narration along with the digital is a great idea, but it needs to work better.", "Date": "January 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "No HDMI port", "Author": "Tammy", "ReviewID": "R1D5OJ0MYQV4O", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I ordered this unit to replace my current Kindle Fire HD which has 32 GB.

I got the top of the line, 64G 4G Kindle, and love it. Using AT&T;, the Share plan or whatever its called between iPhone plus Kindle - my monthly plan is virtually the SAME PRICE split between 2 devices - not hardly a penny more, for top of the line plan, so its not even an extra cost- which is great, my monthly bill is about $135 for cell and now for cell + Kindle. the Kindle picture is gorgeous. Its like watching the best little TV you ever bought, incredibly high quality viewing.It was NOT ready/charged right out of the box, but big deal, it charged quickly. Had a bit of trouble, needed a couple resets but Amazon CUSTOMER SERVICE was RIGHT THERE for chat plus then phone help and when they say 24/7, they mean it! There was NO wait and no issue with any language barrier with the reps on the phone - very courteous, helpful, and quickly resolved the setup issue- I was very pleased w/Amazon's service and was able to enjoy the Kindle quickly.LOTS of FREE games for kids plus adults - a HUGE plus, totally worth getting AMAZON PRIME for, free shipping, etc with the 80/annual fee. I am sure I will get my $$$ worth on Prime membership with all the available movies, TV, books, and free shipping on so many items. I probably already have just with Christmas shopping.

I usually buy Apple products but I was intrigued with the marketing campaign by Amazon. I am a marketing professional so I appreciate it when a company goes the extra mile with a quality campaign. I spent three months comparing the different options and ended up with two; iPad Air and Kindle HDX 8.9. I think the iPad Air is Nirvana, it is made with such quality that it has a museum piece. I feel. the only problem is that I am so familiar with Apple products that it was too familiar, just like what I work on every day. The Kindle on the other hand was new and different and that made it interesting to me. I then decided to see which company wanted my business more.....Apple offered no discounts and Amazon offered a payment plan plus had a special that week for Prime members. Plus when I went to the Best Buy to give them both a try the Apple rep was arrogant and rude. I read all the customer reviews for the Kindle on the Amazon site so I was familiar with all the major complaints i.e., no access to Google Docs and Google Play and Google Apps store. I learned all about side loading the google apps via Mobile 1 app etc. These learnings really helped shape my decision because I knew that it was not a plain old Google Android based device and I was glad because that was what made this Kindle interesting....it was daring to be different. I actually like the Silk Browser, I like the way that Youtube works on it and yes, I can sign into Youtube and have access to all my channels and subscriptions (may have been an issue in the past but not anymore). I side loaded Chrome and yes it does not work exactly like it should but it allows me to use Google Maps with GPS so it knows my location. I use the Kindle at work and can do everything that I want with my Exchange Active Sync Email for my corporate email and I use the Office Suite Pro for word, excel, powerpoint and adobe PDFs. I use the Amazon Cloud Drive for storage and Amazon Cloud Player for transferring my music from my laptop. The issue with the Cloud Drive is that you can only stream videos that are less than 20 minutes from the Cloud Drive onto your Kindle (don't know why they limit that and wish they would not). I bought the 16GB version thinking that I could upgrade my Cloud Drive account and store everything on it but the video limitation is a problem. That is the reason that I only gave this tablet 4 stars. Otherwise, I love the functionality of the Kindle and the Amazon ecosystem for my books, magazines, movies, tv shows, music, Prime Membership, shopping etc...it makes life much easier and convenient.", "Date": "April 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love it.  Goes everywhere with me now", "Author": "Scott(y) \"Scott Van Tussenbrook\"", "ReviewID": "R4SKMDZ3SKD8H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been window-shopping for a tablet for a few months, and I've had my Kindle Fire HDX for a couple of weeks now.  I'm just going to respond to some points that seem to keep cropping up in reviews.The App StoreSince I spent more than six seconds researching this before I bought it, I already knew the Amazon App Store wasn't Google Play, and that there would be apps missing.  I'm a heavy Google user -- Gmail, Maps, Voice, all of it.  I still don't miss these functions on my Kindle.  Why?  Because I have all that on my PHONE, and I'm not trying to have my Kindle just be the same device I already have, just bigger.  Apps that are missing are handled ably by replacements.  The native Mail/Calendar/Contacts apps are functional if simple, and they stay perfectly synced with my Google info.  It's not Gmail but it works.  All the other apps I wanted WERE available and work fantastic -- Evernote, Netflix, HBO GO, Pandora, Goodreads, etc.  Disappointed that the Facebook app is just a shell around the mobile FB website, but all the other apps are the real thing.BluetoothYes it does come with Bluetooth, and yes it works great.  I spent the weekend streaming music from my Kindle to a Bose Soundlink and it worked perfectly nonstop.GPSIf you get the 4G model (I have Verizon), you do get GPS.  No Google Maps, but Waze is in the App Store and works just as well, for turn-by-turn nav and everything.  (My only beef here is with Verizon charging me a $35 \"activation charge\" to add the Kindle to my account, which I did by myself, online.  $35 charge anyway.  Thanks, phone company.)Origami coverI got the blue Origami cover/case.  It looks fantastic, and works fine for what it says it does.  It is a bit heavy, but the device is only held in with magnets so if you want to take it out for holding and reading it's super easy.  Buttons for power and volume are mirrored exactly with buttons on the case.  It's way overpriced, but it's a perfect match for the device.ChargerI bought the $19,99 \"fast charger,\" not knowing that the exact same one comes with it in the box.  (Buyer beware.)  One thing that did make me go \"huh\" was, while it was plugged in, I got a \"you are using a low-voltage charger, if using your device while charging the battery may still drain,\" etc. message.  It doesn't act like a low-voltage charger -- charges all the way up from dead in just a few hours, EVEN while you are using it.  Not sure what that message was about.Now, on to the good stuff:Reading books (Kindle)This is my first e-reader/tablet of any kind, so I don't have anything else to compare it to, but the Kindle Fire makes reading books an unexpected pleasure.  I chewed through an entire novel in one day, last weekend.  I like the ability to look up words, make highlights and notes to go back to, and the X-Ray feature is interesting, not as much fun as for TV/Movies (more on that in a minute) but still provides some fun trivia/info.  I don't notice any blue or purple haze anywhere on the screen, edges or otherwise.  Apparently they have taken care of that issue.  (And IMHO the beige/sepia color scheme is more comfortable for reading than black/white anyway.)MusicPlaying music is no-frills, but solid.  I have all my music in Amazon's Cloud player ($25/year).  This is the first time since the old-school iPods with the giant hard drives, that I have been able to \"bring my whole collection with me.\"  Not literally, since 90% of it lives in the cloud, but between the Wi-Fi and the 4G for when I'm not in a usual haunt, same difference.  The X-Ray for music isn't as useful to me, mostly it shows you song lyrics, and most of my music is indie/DJ/mixtape/etc so Amazon doesn't have the sing-a-long lyrics for much of it.Movies/TV\"Competitors:\"  Netflix, HBO GO, Hulu+ all work seamlessly and look beautiful.  They're not kidding about the screen on this thing -- I know I have old eyes, but I seriously cannot even see pixels, even when trying to.  It's like the picture is smoother than in real life.  The picture is so good it is *almost* too much.  I have 1080p TV's at home and the Kindle Fire HDX is starting to make them look grainy by comparison.  I really can't say enough good things about the picture quality.  Held up next to an iPad Air there is no comparison -- the Kindle wins hands down.  Here is where I really do like the X-Ray.  I like to re-watch movies and TV shows, and with X-Ray activated, everyone currently in scene on the screen, appears to the left, in a selectable list that takes you to that person's IMDB bio.  I can't be the only one who watches shows and wonders, \"Where else have I seen him/her...\"  Well now that info is a click away.  (X-Ray only works with content streamed or purchased from Amazon.)  One note regarding downloading videos -- I got the 64 GB version (just in case), and I find it takes FOR EVER to download movies, especially HD but even the regular ones really seem to take their time.  If you're going on a plane trip and are wanting to bring a few downloaded movies with you, be prepared to queue them up and then let it spend the whole day downloading.  This is true regardless of where I'm connected -- including at work, where we have the fastest internet known to mankind -- so I don't think it's a network issue.  Either Amazon is throttling movie downloads or these files really do just take forever to download, but it ALMOST makes the ability to download seem beside the point.  It's just as fast an easy to stream them instead.  If I had it to do over again I would probably just stick with 32 GB.ConclusionYes, this device is basically a very fancy, window-dressed portal to your purchasing and consuming Amazon stuff.  This is not a secret.  I went with the Kindle over a pure-Google/Android Samsung or something or the iPad, because I'm already invested in Amazon's \"ecosystem.\"  I'm a Prime member, and I've had Amazon VoD on my Roku for years now, so I have a medium-sized collection of purchased videos.  I uploaded my whole music library as well.  If you're just as heavily invested in iTunes/Apple stuff then you may feel there's something lacking, just like I would have, had I bought an iPad.  As it is, as soon as I logged in with my account on the Kindle, there was all of my stuff.  Boom.  The \"pure Android\" Google tablets, I didn't even consider.  As I said at the top, I bought the Kindle fire *because* it was not trying to be a clone of my phone.  (And I don't like the Google media apps that I *have* tried to use -- Google Play Music on my phone is glitchy, crashy, and I don't like the interface.)  This device is for reading books, listening to music, and watching movies.  Yes, preferably (and easily) from Amazon.  I don't think anyone is making a secret of this.  I don't need to be able to edit Excel spreadsheets.  (That's what the laptop is for.)  I don't need Google Maps (that's what my phone is for.)  What this device does, it does very, VERY well.I just priced iPads on Apples's site and the iPad air, similarly configured to my Kindle (64GB, 4G Wireless + GPS) is $829.  I paid $539 for the Kindle.  For a difference nearly $300, I can put up with looking at an advertisement for 2 seconds while I flip open the cover.  (I can't believe people complain about those ads.  You can get rid of them by paying the $15 -- even if you've bought one with ads, the \"upgrade\" is simple.)No, this is not \"just like the iPad,\" and it is not a clone of the Google Nexus, and neither is it trying to be either of those things.  I love it, and I could not be happier with my purchase.Quick update/additionTwo things I forgot to mention above:Silk web browserWorks fine for me, even when browsing my school's eCollege website, which is famously glitchy - looks just as good as on my computer.  And the \"reading mode\" (where it clears away all the artwork and clutter and leaves only text, Kindle book-style) is a game changer.  Love it.GamesI am not at all a big gamer, but since they give you a bunch of Amazon coin credits, I decided to give it a whirl.  GT Racing 2 is too much fun, and The Room is fun and interesting and relaxing in a weird way.  Among many others.  I didn't get this device to play games on, specifically, but that has quickly become one of my favorite things about it.  The thing is basically just a toy for grown-ups.", "Date": "February 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Absolutely the best - especially on a cruise ship!", "Author": "Travelcat", "ReviewID": "RDYFFHLVGUZXD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A week after receiving the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\", we took it on a cruise.WiFi is difficult at best at sea but the Kindle out-performed all of its' competition.Passengers with other tablets lined up in the computer room to get help as they kept having the signal drop.  I did not have that problem.  I later spoke with the computer guru on the ship and was told that the most popular tablet keeps some things running in the background - almost indefinitely which shows it down considerably.I used the Kindle for emails, surfing the web, taking photographs and playing games.  The photographs came out amazingly well.  As soon as I got back on the ship to get a WiFi signal, it was easy to send the photos to my friends and family.  If there is one weakness in the Kindle, it is that the button you touch to take a picture is a bit sensitive.

I'm not sure whether the original problem was with the Fire software or perhaps a rogue app I had installed, but everything is working fine now and I couldn't be happier.---Update: this review has apparently been classified with the 16GB Fire HDX 8.9, but I actually have the 64GB version. As I said, I couldn't be happier. I am also glad that I got the 64GB version - I initially started downloading movies at the top resolution (1080p I think) and it actually didn't take me too long to run out of storage after less than half a dozen downloads. I'm now using the medium quality (720p), which is perfectly fine and typically 2-2.5GB each.", "Date": "December 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "THIS IS MY NEW BEST FRIEND!", "Author": "terry lanning", "ReviewID": "R3JYRKR66CZIC0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have never been much of a tech person but  I don't leave home without my Kindle.

To me, tablets & ecspecially Kindle's, are the best new technological devices that have come out in awhile. My first was a Kindle Keyboard that I got for really cheap thru gathering points on another web site and this is my second. I do get the extended warranty but did not use it with my first Kindle. I did get it again with this one only because I began to have problems with the Kindle Keyboard after my warranty expired. I can't complain because it was heavily used & abused...LOL...I love Amazon's Kindles and the price is right for what I need it for.

My only criticism is that setting up the device can be a little confusing and at times frustratingly challenging, even for a seasoned computer user like myself. But I guess that is due to its Linux based Android operating systems, the inner workings of which only a seasoned Linux user would find anything less than esoteric. So some work on that aspect please Amazon, calling the help line is great, but the success of a device as regards the ease of setting it up, should be measured in the lack of calls, not its volume.

all hype. However, I have had some hiccups with service quality worth noting.The big issue is that the device would not download anything a couple of days ago, with everything just hanging in the queue. I hit the Mayday button, and someone eventually called me back. This was the second time I used Mayday, and the second time I was shifted over to someone else on a different platform. So, to be clear: Mayday is not a tech support service, but what you use when you can't figure out how to crop an image or something else simple. Considering the considerable amount of promotion around instant customer service via Mayday, this is a massive limitation and is the reason for one of the missing stars in this review.I received a phone call from an Amazon rep immediately after getting off the line with the Mayday rep, and this phone interaction lasted more than an hour. He made an earnest effort to help, but it actually made the problem worse. See the attached video - which I made for an earlier and considerably different draft of this review - to see what happened. I actually lost access to my book library. I eventually fixed this myself, by resetting to factory default. But, this then required more than an hour of re-customizing my device.On top of this, five graphic novels I purchased for the Kindle are only downloading in low-resolution files, making them look outright blurry. This appears to be a software issue, since a service rep was able to download higher res files to his device. It is automatically pushing these five - and just these five - titles to my device in inferior quality. I did both a Mayday call and an e-mail about this about two weeks ago, with no resolution, and no follow-up until yesterday.A very friendly customer service rep called me last night and took notes on both the major problem that led to the reset, and the graphic novel issue. He is still researching the latter.I hope that these are temporary issues that are just coming with a new launch and that I will be able to add another star to this review soon. However, until I can get content I paid for at a reasonable quality and go a few more weeks without having to reset my device (note: I never had to reset my original model Kindle Fire in two years of ownership), I am hesitant to enthusiastically recommend this, despite the awesome hardware.Note: This review is almost completely rewritten from the original post, reflecting some responses from Amazon.", "Date": "November 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Light, Thin, an iPad contender", "Author": "Chow", "ReviewID": "RS7WXHXW7G2P3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What an improvement over the Kindle Fire HD!

Thus far, the last 2 hours spent with the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" have been amazing.  The screen on this device needs to be experienced first hand.  I've had some amazing LCD screens for my PCs and smartphones, but this thing is just remarkable.  It is hands down more beautiful than any other screen I've had my hands on.It's also a very \"snappy\" tablet. It just speeds along without a single slow down.  I had it downloading books, a hand full of graphic novels, The Hobbit Extended edition (also just purchased), and all the apps I needed...and it never slowed down.  No hiccups, no lag, no freezes...NO PROBLEMS...no sweat.I also don't see the \"blue border\" issue reported for the 7\" HDX. I've tried all different brightness levels and white/sepia/black backgrounds (in bright and dark rooms) and I just don't see the blue \"halo\" around the edge of the device.  Maybe I got lucky...maybe it's not an issue with the 8.9\" versions.The only downsides thus far are that I notice it leaves a much wider margin around the page when reading books than my old Kindle Fire HD did.  I've played with all the settings and it's just leaving bigger margins.  I prefer to have it almost edge to edge all around, but this doesn't let me get nearly as close as my old HD did.  Not a deal breaker...but odd.  Also, for some reason I've only seen 1 lock-screen image.  All I've seen is the film reel and there is no time on the lock-screen, which I would have sworn I saw in pre-release screenshots and is currently on my old 7\" HD. Weird...I even tried to turn the power off several times...and it's always the same image. The old HD had a handful it went through...I thought the new versions would too, and I really wish the time was listed. Heck...while I'm making wishes, how about notifications for emails on the lock-screen!Overall, this device is spooky fast and beautiful.  I'll update this review as I use it more.

A partial list of the very good:* The fabulous screen (FAB-U-LOUS!)* The ulta-lightness (it feel like the battery must be missing)* The great sound* Sharp sharp sharp text* The joy of reading Kindle books on it (no rim of purple or blue)* The smooth, quick operation--no stuttering!* The really surprisingly decent cameras front and back* The straight-forward and easy process to add (and view) my photographs and videos to this Kindle (Bravo! nothing hidden or difficult!)* The placement of the power and sound buttons are perfect for me* ALL the improvements in the operating system from the previous model listed in previous reviews are spot on. Great job Amazon!HOWEVER:* The fit and finish on mine is off. Where the rubberized section meets the shiny plastic on the back is not level, so there's just enough of a sharp ridge of the shiny plastic close to the top corners on both sides to make it uncomfortable to hold. It's where I normally would grasp it, and it's irritating like a bad seam in a shoe or a tag in a shirt that has to be cut out. It makes it feel cheap and I find myself wondering if I could just take a bit of sandpaper & fix it, but one shouldn't need to fix the finish on a tablet.* The app store (you've already read about it)* I thought I would not mind the ads on the opening screen, but I find that I dislike them more and more. They tend toward unattractive or childish ads for apps in which I have no interest. Again, this cheapens the experience for me. I really wish for the ability to personalize the screens with my own photographs to take advantage of that beautiful screen.Tablets are a very personal choice and what may not bother many may rub someone else the wrong way. It's obvious that this little much improved jewel will be love at first sight for some, but I'm beginning to feel that the Kindle HDX 8.9 and I will just be friends.

I wanted something that I could play video's ( Prime Member)  currently prime does not work on other andriods, Listen to music and take along notes for various projects.  I ended up going with the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 with 32 gb.  The applications that are avaialble are what I would use for any other device.  Keep in mind all devices have there limitations.  The limitation here is that you can only get apps from Amazon and not all applications available will work on your device.Pros:- The screen has crisp colors and the brightness can be adjusted to personal tast.-Start screen,  the start screen falls in line with the other tablets showing icons that you use the most along with the carosel.- Recently used apps are available while in an applications, by running fingure at the bottom of the page and dragging up to the top._ Built in speakers and volume are nice it has an setting to control the volume, that is behind the applications, so if you only want the valume you go so loud that can be set in the setting,- Battery life is decent, however standby time could be improved (a week at most).- Integration with the Amazon app store and Prime instant video was very seamless and easy to use._ With the latest version Doc go to the cloud so they can be retrieved by other devices, orginally had a seperate doc folder that was not accessable from the web.- The interface is surprisingly easy to navigate, although there are some inconsistencies (ie. the back button moving between apps) that could be improved with software updates.- CPU speed is really responsive, takes less then 30 seconds to boot from a cold start. tapping on once of the categories will bring up the screen within 10 seconds.-  Prime Movie Downloads.  While traveling I was able to download movies to watch on the plane,- MAYDAY!!! feature is good, they will help you troubleshoot your issues, must have WiFi acess for this to work.  If they cannot help you they will take your number and have a rep call you back.  They called me within 60 seconds.-Battery Life - I am able to get 8 - 12 hours of video usage out of my device.-Power on/off button.  Having the power off button on the back rather than on the bottom like the orginal fire is alot easier to use.- Easily transfer between device and cloud-Able to use Kindle to make telephone calls, that were crisp and clear.- Bluetooth - used a bluetooth keyboard that worked great. ( when not in use need to remember to turn bluetooth off)Cons:- No Google apps or Google features (only a problem if you\u2019re mobile world is heavily influenced by Google; pictures, contacts, etc)- I had issues with switching between airplane mode and wifi, my WiFi would cut out after using airplane mode.- Not all web pages are compatabile with SILK the new web browser ( was trying to use Skillport).- Games show under apps and under Games-Cannot have an application open and display song information at the same time.-Had issues with the speakers, would not play sound after being in airplane mode.

I called Amazon, the technical department told me that blue haze was an enhancement and is not a defect.  So, I tried to live with the \"enhancement\" for about a week, and found that I could not overlook the \"enhancement\".  I tried different level of brightness, different color background, but found the blue haze to be intolerable.  I took, the advice of the Amazon technician who told me that there is no blue haze around the 8.9 inch HDX, and ordered the larger sibling with 64GB Wifi.Indeed, the new unit 8.9\" has _NO_ blue haze.  The screen is clear and more crisper than 7\" and I think better than the IPad.  The functionality of 8.9\" unit is otherwise identical to the smaller 7\" little brother( same cpu, ram, etc.)I opted for 64GB to be able to store about 30Gb of music on the tablet, along with some amount of videos for keeping kids entertained in road tripsI have LG G2 with 5.3\" screen, 10 inch IPad and Android tablet,  12\" laptop, 15\" laptop, 17\" laptop, and 24\" desktop. Originally I thought 7\" would be the nice intermediate size between the smart phone and the IPad.  I found that after using both 7\" and 8.9\",  8.9\" is a more proper size that best fit my objectives.It is my belief, that there is no one device that can be designed to be best in all aspects of its function. So, depending on your objectives, IPAD, Nexus 7, Galaxy tab, etc. maybe a better fit.In order of importance for my objectives for the device:1) For reading books, which is THE primary objective for purchasing  Kindle 8.9 HDX, I believe that this unit is better than other competing devices.2) For viewing Video for entertainment purpose.  The screen is vivid and more than adequate for viewing any video.  Also, audio streaming to Bluetooth speaker.  I have already taken up about 28 GB of spaces for the MP3 files, and have currently 27GB left over for other purposes.  The sound quality of the built-in speaker cannot escape its physical limitations.  However, for medium background noise environment, the built-in speaker is adequate.3) The non-writing based work such as web surfing, and simple web interactions.  For simple viewing of web pages such as Wiki, it is very good choice due to its light weight and long running battery life.4) For Apps: For simple apps such as guitar tuner, FFT, Wolfram Alpha, specialized calculators, etc. the Kindle is a capable tool.  However, since I also have Android devices with me always, the most applications do not need to be in both Android phone and Kindle.  For application that can use larger \"real estate\" such as Wolfram Alpha in displaying graphs and visual, the 8.9 inch is a great advantage.The Play Store apps, though not directly accessible, most app can be side-loaded and used in Kindle.  If the Apps were the primary objectives, I would have chosen Google devices such as Nexus 7 ( cheaper though less size in \"real estate\").So, if your primary objective is to read books using Kindle (as it should be), it has no rival.  The screen is gorgeous.  Then, add to it, the battery life, the feather-light weight, the Prime membership, the ability to run apps, browse web in reasonably responsive manner, all give it a very high mark.My wish list for the Kindle future added enhancement or functionality:\u2022 Full support of Play Store.\u2022 mini-SD card slot\u2022 Streaming Video from NAS drives (wirelessly)\u2022 USB 3.0 connection.  This would enable video streaming from external USB HD.Above will definitely make Kindle a IPAD killer.

I decided to try out the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9''.  I currently use the iPad Air and been using iPad 2 for a year and a half.  I really enjoyed playing with this Kindle Fire.  Interface needed some getting used to, but one I figured it out, it was very user friendly. It was strange not having a home button.  Sometimes, when playing games, I would accidentally bring up the 'home' bar, but face that with iOS 7 also.  I love the cloud feature and the integration of all of my Amazon services.Amazon gave 500 coins, which was about $5.00 to try some apps.  I purchased a game and a move rental.  Screen was clear and sharp for all videos, including the rental and videos on Amazon Prime.  But the games seem to lose resolution.  I am going to assume its due the games haven't been formatted for new higher resolution screen.Design was sharp looking and Kindle is lighter than the iPad Air, but the plastic makes it feel less expensive and not as sturdy as I feel with the iPad Air.  I did like the separation of the Left and Right speakers, gave it a more stereo feel to it.Price was great, cheaper than iPad Air, this comes with my biggest issue.  All my apps, games, music, and movies are from iTunes.  Even though I really enjoyed the Kindle, it will require me to make another couple of thousand of dollars investment to switch from iTunes to Amazon.  Which I cannot do.

For most of the years since I have had an Archos because up to this point nothing else beat it for speed, resolution or versatility (compatibility with the broadest array of file types).  My Archos 101 G9 Turbo ICS 8GB 10-Inch Tablet 2 generations back still beats the specs of most existing tablets.  I read a lot of reviews before I buy and am usually up on not only what is out, but what has not yet been released.  I finally bought a kindle this year because it is the first tablet that bests the Archos on speed, resolution and value.  I went to best buy to look at it and had a hard time getting near it. The kids were lined up, could not put it down.  It really is as fast as a console.  Most people honestly do not need this much speed lol.  Where it will shine for the average person is in superior video, high pixel count, clarity of color.  It was the improved color rendering which was most noticeable to me.  I am amazed at reviews complaining about either speed or resolution. Nothing else out now touches it.  The form factor and build quality are really nice.  This is a wonderful little device which really is beyond the needs of most people.  There is little to legitimately complain about.  Most of the valid criticism I have seen has to do with access to the play store.  For me it is not an issue. I have been able to find all the aps I want or need on Amazon, but I do understand that some people want specific things for business which may or may not be available.  If that is a potential issue for you check Amazon's ap store.But, honestly, ignore reviews complaining about speed or screen resolution.  Go to any tech site and you will see that this tablet is the highest on both counts.I really didn't *need* a new tablet. I have 4 already :O but was grabbed by the form factor and build, had to check out the screen.  It really is an instant on tablet with just gorgeous color rendition and amazing clarity.

Some of them can have features you don't understand and sometimes they just all seem to be the same thing at different prices, so you don't know which one to pick. As someone who has had personal experience with several different tablets (and a couple e-readers), I would recommend this one. It comes with so many features and options that it may seem overwhelming at first, but it's definitely worth sifting through it all.The Kindle Fire HDX is designed with the user in mind and is built to help you do everything you would want to on a tablet. The Kindle has always had a pretty good display, but this one truly takes it to the next level. The images and colors pop out at you just as well as any good computer, and possibly better than some. They also gave us improved brightness settings and reduced the glare so you can use the tablet in bright lights or outside without blinding yourself or having to deal with those annoying bright spots.The performance is better than any Kindle before. In layman's terms, it works faster and better than ever before. Even so, it's very thin for easy holding and storage, but very durable, so it takes more to break it. It claims to have a 12 hour battery life, or 18 if you're just reading, but in my experience it can often stretch to around 20, depending on what you're doing.The two cameras, one on the front and one on the back, are excellent. The front camera offers a pretty clear picture. It's perfect for taking selfies or things like video calls with your friends or your boss. The read end camera takes amazing quality pictures and comes with a flash option so you can even use the camera in dark environment. The rear end camera also comes with several features and options which improve picture taking.The Kindle Fire HDX also has a new feature which they call the MayDay button. It's basically a help button that you can push at any time. It connects you to a live representative who can help you with any problem you're having with the Kindle. They're available at any time, for free. I've used the service a couple of times when I was confused about how to do something and they were great. They helped me fix my issue quickly and they were super polite. This feature may seem unnecessary but you won't think that when you end up needing it. You'll be glad that it's there and that you can use it for free!It comes with Prime Instant Video downloads. You have to already be an Amazon Prime member to use it, but once you are, this feature means that you can download any video from Amazon Prime to your tablet. Then you can watch it wherever you are, even if you don't have an internet connection. I use this to watch movies on long flights. It keeps me entertained and even helps me a bit with the sick feeling I usually get on planes.The tablet comes with a lot of new apps that can help you do the stuff that's important to you, like accessing your email and calender, plus a lot of other new apps to help your productivity. Of course, you can still install all the other apps that you might want to, just like with any other tablet.They've also added a new and improved operating system for this version, which they call Mojito. It starts with an Android base, but Amazon has added on a lot of their own stuff to make it more personal and easier to use for their customers. Mojito is completely customer oriented, so you're sure to love how convenient it is and what it can do for you.This tablet comes with a huge amount of other features that I can't possibly discuss here as thoroughly as they deserve to be. Beyond that, it has some options that are personalize at the time of purchase. They give you three options for the amount of storage you want - 16 GB, 32 GB, or 64 GB. I personally am using the 64 GB version, but if you're usually the tablet casually or just for reading, you can probably get away with a smaller amount of storage.They let you choose whether or not you want to see advertisements on your table (what they call special offers), and it's not that much more, so I would recommend getting the ad free version, but it's not that big of a deal if you don't want to pay extra for it.They also give you options about your internet connection. You can choose to get just Wi-fi, or you can get 4G LTE from either Verizon or AT&T.; I go through AT&T; and it's always worked perfectly for me. Pages load great and load time is nearly non-existent.You can also buy a 2 year warranty which includes accident protection. This isn't necessary, but I would recommend it, just in case something happens. Paying a little more to get the warranty is a lot cheaper than if the tablet breaks for whatever reason and you don't have any way to replace it. After all, buying a replacement tablet will cost far more than what you would pay for the warranty. It just makes sense when you do the math. You might also want to consider buying a case for it. I have one, and it helps me to keep it safe, plus it looks pretty cool.Overall, I would definitely recommend the Kindle Fire HDX, whether you're looking for a new tablet or just a simple e-reader. It has the features to be great for everybody.

I've used the iPad, iPad mini and Blackberry Playbook, so I had a pretty good idea of what I wanted in a tablet. In the end, I narrowed it down to the Kindle Fire and iPad because I'm a member of Prime and I wanted to view Amazon streaming video on on a mobile device. Also, my favorite apps are not available for Android devices. I chose the Kindle Fire because of price and I know I will still one day get an iPad. So, the Fire is my iPad Mini. In terms of functionality, and I'll discuss this more below, the Fire is more reader and less tablet.With all that said, here's what I do love about the device -- it's a great value. The size is perfect for reading and I do love to hold it portrait style and read it like a book. If I feel really daring, I do so without the origami case so that I can appreciate how lightweight it is. The Amazon leather origami case is a really cool idea, but not great protection. Took me a day or so to get used to it. I do wish is was lighter and I wish I could get it in pink.I like the organization of my stuff -- carousel, home page/favorites and collections. I do have suggestions for improvements:1. I wish you could add web pages to the carousel2.  I wish the tablet would learn that just because I used something recently, I don't want it in the carousel.3.  I wish the collections could be for more than apps. For example, for my morning devotion time, I would love a collection that contained my gospel playlist, Bible reading apps and certain Kindle books.4.  There's no way to organize picturesMayday is so sweet. Although, I've realized that the help is really about technical issues, not bigger questions like why can't the device run Google apps. Still, this is an awesome feature if you a gifting the Fire to someone who is not tech savvy.As expected, the Amazon apps work great. I would like more visual notification to indicate which movies and TV shows that can be downloaded to the device. It should be just as easy to spot as the Prime indicator.The biggest disappointment with the Fire is no Google apps (as of January 1, 2014). This is why I consider the Fire more of a reader and less of a tablet. Without Google apps like Drive, Google Maps; YouTube and the full cadre of Android apps (like Instagram), this device fails to be a really serious workhorse. For those who use Chrome, you never realize how much you depend on it until it's gone. Don't be confused by the Google apps you see in the Amazon Appstore. These are workarounds developed by others; there are no Google apps, developed by Google, in the Appstore. You can sideload some Anddroid apps onto the Kindle (and I have done so for Instagram and PocketBible), but my point is that I shouldn't have to.If Google and Apple can find common ground, I simply don't understand why Amazon has to be so territorial with the Kindle. I'm wondering if this is the same marketing mistake Blackberry made with the Playbook; the marketplace has pretty much decided that we need two mobile operating systems, iOS and Android. I'm sure Amazon will say that developers have the option of putting versions of their apps in the Amazon App Store, but the fact that many haven't says something.Being forced to live without Google apps has forced me to discover a new favorite app -- Feedly, for blog reading. I've downloaded it to my Android and Apple devices.My next biggest issue with the Fire is the Special Offers. (I know I have the option of removing them for $15.) I'm complaining not because they are there, but because they are so 'untargeted' to me. Amazon has more than a decade of my purchasing history, wish lists, web data and tons of my reviews. Serve me ads for stuff you'd think I'd buy. I was expecting Special Offers to be so much better -- as good as recommendations on my Amazon.com homepage. The Special Offers are generally crappy because I have no interest in the products.Update 2/17/14: I have found a bug in the music playlists. I create my playlists on the cloud using my Kindle. I then dowload them to the device. All of the songs are already saved to the device before I download the playlist. However, songs will be missing from the downloaded playlist. The cloud version has 117 songs, the on-device version has three. Mayday and customer support gave me a solution. So, I uninstalled all music from the device and downloaded it all again from the cloud. I then downloaded the cloud playlists and the problem was solved -- for a few hours. Later, when I updated and created new cloud playlists; uninstalled the device playlists; and downloaded the cloud playlists again, songs were missing.Update 3/15,14: After weeks of back and forth, the issue above was resolved with a replacement Kindle. My cloud playlists loaded onto the device without a hitch. I haven't revised the cloud versions and tried to reload onto the device yet; no new songs have caught my ear. I have to say the getting the issue resolved left me very frustrated. Amazon's usually stellar customer service just didn't bring its A-game. I was so relieved when the rep I spoke with a week ago agreed to ship me another device. It took way too long to get to that solution.I find the speed to be slower than my iPhone and Galaxy phone.  I used all three while playing my favorite mobile game via Wi-Fi. When response time matters, I go for the iPhone instead of the Fire.My Fire has a problem connecting to free Wi-Fi. I haven't hit the Mayday button yet to figure out if it's something I'm doing wrong. The device will connect, but it takes a long while for it to tell you that you need to go to the provider's web page to agree to the terms and conditions. Opening the Silk browser yourself to get to the permissions page doesn't always work.I ordered the 16GB version based on other reviewers' comments regarding Prime movie and TV downloads. If I had it to do over again, I would have given more thought to the 32 GB because I have the Wi-Fi version. If I had gotten Wi-Fi+4G, 16 GB would have been just fine because I would have always had the connectivity to stream what I wanted to watch.All in all, the Fire isn't a bad purchase. I think how much you like it depends on what you're used to from other tablets and even your smartphone. It's a good value, but Amazon needs to rethink the relationship with Google. My user experience isn't as rich as it could be without more Android apps.", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Definitely A Keeper!", "Author": "Hal in Howell", "ReviewID": "R2NDI6FL9MORTJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 last Thursday and I am very pleased.  It is SO fast compared to the Kindle Fire HD and lighter, too.  The HDX has a much more responsive touch screen and unmatched screen resolution.  WiFi set up was effortless. I was able to easily set up my various email accounts and download all the apps I used on the old KFHD including Netflix for video streaming (I also have Amazon Prime).  I side-loaded the Dolphin browser in order to view Flash videos (just like on my old HD).  Battery endurance seems very good and have run the HDX several hours at a time (I've not run the battery flat yet and recharge every morning).My only criticism of the HDX is the lack of the HDMI plug (I know, wireless is the future and all that, but I did like having it for travel where wireless video connection is just not available).  I'm holding on to my HD solely for the HDMI functionality.  This complaint is certainly not a deal killer.I've barely used the rear-facing camera (took just one photo to see if it worked and it does and the photo looked very good and I will be using it in the future). The rear-facing camera is a great addition and remedies my major complaint about the KFHD.The only real problem I've encountered with the HDX is that I'm unable to delete photos I downloaded from the Cloud (see updates below).  Enter the Mayday button.  I've got to say that Amazon's customer service is second to none (I guess it's part of their on-going plan for World Domination).  I pressed the Mayday button and I had a live CS person on-line within 15 seconds.  She attempted to fix the photo deletion problem without success.  However, she escalated the issue to a tech support person who, after going through several diagnostic procedures, wrote up a trouble ticket to pass on to the developers; all this taking place on-line (the problem is apparently unique).  A callback is scheduled for later this week.  The whole point of this story is to show how responsive Amazon is to customer problems.  BTW, the photo deletion issue in no way affects the functionality of my Kindle.I read just about all the 1-star reviews before purchasing and found few complaints that were credible (it seems that most of the negative reviews were by iPad fanboys or by those who just didn't know what they were talking about.  I invite you to read those reviews and see for yourself; they are quite entertaining in a perverse sort of way). The Kindle Fire HDX that I own is not the same HDX the 1-star reviewers were talking about.At the end of the day, the KFHDX is a superb device.  It is definitely not just an e-book reader.  I'm still discovering all that it can do.  I highly recommend it.I will update this review with the results of the Kindle problem mentioned above.*********Update January 3, 2014**********Received a callback from Amazon (on-time as promised) regarding the photo deletion problem.  The developers are stumped, but are still working on it.  There is supposed to be a new software update release in the next couple of weeks that may resolve the issue.  If that fails, we may try a factory reset (not my favorite solution as I'll have to reenter all my email settings, etc.).  If the reset fails Amazon will just send me a new device and I'll just start over.  I'm pleased with Amazon's efforts, though disappointed it may require a reset or de-registration or replacement of the Kindle.  At least the problem doesn't affect the Kindle's functionality in any way.  High marks to Amazon CS.  I still love the Kindle.  Further updates will be forthcoming.*********Update January 11, 2014*********I solved the photo deletion issue!  The problem was I was unable to delete photos.  The Kindle kept asking if I wanted to delete the photos from the Cloud (there were no photos on the Cloud).  I solved the problem by asking the Kindle to download the undeleteable (that's not a word, is it) photos from the Cloud even though there were no photos on the Cloud).  I could then delete them.  Apparently the Kindle got locked in some sort of loop and attempting to download non-existent photos broke the loop.  It took me awhile to figure it out, but it worked.  I'll have to let Kindle CS know about this.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wow, this is a very nice tablet!", "Author": "KG62", "ReviewID": "R25ZBU5V21KSHN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was my Christmas present, I love it!

I have had a few stops and starts trying to figure out how to use a full touch screen electronic component. Also navigating the store and my library. Not all my kindle games are compatable with the fire. My review is less from a tech head perspective and more of just a user.I got it and it was automatically registered to my account since I bought it through Amazon. I was thrilled to see I was given some free tokens for audio books and games which I used. (I had a driving trip coming up the following week) The audio book played well through the aux outlet to the car stereo. I could see my pre-exisiting library on the cloud and select the items to download to my fire device. I got a little stuck 2 weeks into ownership trying to access netflix. It doesn't run on the silk browser. So I tried to download firefox which isn't available for Kindle although the app is in the Amazon store. This  ended up with a mayday call by accident (I was just trying to email customer service) and the rep was on video chat in less than a minute and helped me find the netflix app as well as answer another question about my Amazon watchlist navigation. That mayday app is worth the whole cost of the Kindle in my opinion. I have watched a number of videos, the streaming is great, the download aspect worked well. I could hear well, I didn't even feel the need to use headphones. I have shopped through the audio books, bookstore and videos. It has worked well, no complaints.A word of advice. I wavered between getting the 4G Verizon option or just wifi. At home I have wireless for my internet so it would be no issue for the Kindle. But I do travel occaisonally so I was concerned about that. Then I did the math If I bought 4G it is roughly an additional 80.00 on the cost and then I have to add it to my cell phone plan which runs an additional 20-25.00 a month. The I remembered virtually all 3G 4G smartphones have the hotspot capability. This includes mine and was something  I just discovered this year. So I skipped getting 4G. In the 3 weeks I have been out and about I have had to activate the hotspot option on my phone to allow my kindle to hook up and download a paper. It has worked great. It certainly beats the extra cost of getting 4G capable and the monthly plan addition.

Having owned both the original Kindle Fire and a Kindle Fire HD, I was unsure about the need to upgrade. I couldn't help myself, though. The ability to download Prime movies was exactly what I was waiting for, since I take the train downtown every day. I'm actually impressed with the availability of downloads. I've already downloaded a bunch of episodes of The Shield, Friday Night Lights, and Sherlock. The quantity of available Prime videos for download may seem like it's not enough, but I can only assume Amazon will be vastly expanding this as time goes on.The picture quality was the first thing I noticed. This thing is razor sharp. The video plays very, very well on it, and the sound is good as well. I typically only use my headphones. My only gripe is that changing the volume is a two-step process on the screen now. I'm not sure why they made that harder - you have to tape the screen, then tap the volume icon, then adjust the volume. Previously, the volume slider was available with a simple tap on the screen. I hope they change that with an upgrade. The volume +/- is also on the back of the HDX, which makes it harder to adjust while using a case.This thing is almost weightless. The oragami case more than doubles the weight of it. It is truly impressive how light they have made this while keeping the price down.There is, however, one bad thing, that I'm hoping is just a glitch. My HDX froze after connecting to a new wireless network. It was unable to turn back on. I contacted Amazon's technical support, which was awesome. They're shippng me a replacement, which will be here in two days. The customer service was outstanding, and while this was an unfortunate issue, I wouldn't dock the HDX a star for it (yet). If it happens more often or to other people, it would definitely be a detriment to the reputation of the product. I'm guessing it was an isolated incident, though. I've never had a problem with my other Amazon devices, so I have confidence the replacement HDX will do just fine. I will update the review if anything happens with that one.Overall, this thing is amazing. I do think it's worth the upgrade, especially if you have an original Kindle Fire. The video quality is great, and the ability to download Prime videos is amazing and makes the device worth it on its own if you commute on a train.

It worked OK in the beginning but within a few months it began shutting itself down. It would not come back on unless you did the hard reset, which is holding the power button down for 30 seconds.  This issue continued along with the fact that it would drop your internet connection and it would not update your email unless you shut it completely off.  After a few months of this my husband convinced me to contact Amazon.  The tech I talked to told me that the covers that Amazon sold could be part of the problem and I removed it.  He also tried to get me to reset to factory defaults and I asked to wait and let me give the coverless Kindle a try.It was better but still not right.  Finally I had enough when it shut down on me over 12 times in a row.  Each time staying on less than 45 seconds and freezing.  I did a reset to factory defaults in one of my 45 second windows.  When I tried to set it up again, it froze up.  Needless to say, I once again contacted Amazon and once again, I had to speak with someone that I could not understand.  He tried to get me to reset again and would not listen when I told him it wouldn't stay on long enough for me to do anything.  I got frustrated and hung up on him.My next step was live chat.  I chatted with someone and explained my problem  He must have clocked out for the day because suddenly I was chatting with someone else and he wanted to know what the problem was again.  He was not helpful and if anything I found him to be defensive.  My only option he said was to return it and he had no idea about the covers being a problem.I asked if I was going to get another new one or a refurbished one and he couldn't tell me.  Although he did agree to replace my cover.  He is sending the cover with one day shipping and my Kindle with two day shipping.  What sense does that make?The only positive thing I can about it is the screen is nice when it does decide to work. If I had it to do over I would have asked for the iPad instead.  Live and Learn.  Don't waste your money.UPDATE 05/20/15:I wanted to let everyone know that I received my refurbished Kindle Fire HDX yesterday.  It was supposed to be here on Friday but even though I verified the correct address with the customer service rep twice, it was sent to another address that is not the main address on my account. I was able to contact another customer service rep and all they could say was that he made a mistake and then they had the Kindle re-routed to my home.  I am not happy that I received a used Kindle and the first customer service rep I spoke with told me he would make a note in my file that since mine wasn't used that often he would request a new one for me.

Some have sit there for months, and I still haven't been in the mood for them, but some day I will be and having 64GB certainly helps with that. I don't have to live in fear that I'll get in the mood for a show I don't have.The screen is beautiful. This is my go-to 10\" tablet, mostly used for watching media and for playing a few games. I have a Kindle Paperwhite and I do all of my reading from that, so I don't use this for reading except in some rare situations. I love how this ties into my Audible account, so I always have my Audible books with me as well (again, thank you 64GB).Videos work awesome on this. The resolution is nice and crisp. The speakers are also awesome, though I do wish some tablet maker would have them facing the listener instead of going out the back. I feel like I'm missing a lot of sound with it shooting out its rear end. Sometimes I'll cup the speakers in a way that the sound is redirected back to me, but if I'm listening tot his device, I always do it from the back. Those speakers are awesome, Amazon, please, please, PLEASE figure out a way to move them up front.It says you should get 12 hours of battery life watching video. I've never experienced this. When it was new, maybe 7 hours of battery life. After a few months of using and charging, I can probably burn through a battery in 5 hours watching Hulu or streaming other media. I've seen worse (like Microsoft's Surface tablet and my Dell XPS tablet/laptop), but I expected better from Amazon, especially when it claims 12 hours while watching video and 18 hours while just reading. I'm not seeing it. Apple does tend to live up to their claims on battery life, in my opinion.Otherwise, I've got no regrets dropping $500 on this. I'm usually by a charging source, and since this uses standard USB and not some proprietary connector (*cough* *cough* APPLE *cough*), finding a charging source is easy. It doesn't seem to take long to fully charge this either... maybe an hour or so with a 2.1amp charger. $500 would get you the entry-level Apple iPad, which is only 16GB, which I can fill easily. I have a large-capacity iPad Mini, which is decent for watching shows on, but it seems to struggle with some video and games now and then. I find myself using my iPad Mini less and less and my HDX more and more.If I had to choose again, I'd pick up this HDX over the iPad in a heartbeat.

I have done fairly well with their experimental streaming video on links like CNN.  I like to use instructional videos on you tube and the app I'm using doesn't always show the picture.  I guess when I get annoyed enough with that, I will try Mayday.  I use the Kindle Fire HDX for email, surfing, video and once in awhile listen to my Audible books with it.  My grandson loves YouTube Lego videos, movies, tv shows and games.  The Apple app universe is huge, but I have found more apps than expected or would use. It is a very good size.  I bought an inexpensive case for it,  I think I would prefer the origami design.  This may not be the best place to mention this, but oh how I would love for Amazon to come up with a recommend video program like Netflix does.  I think trying to find something to watch in movies or tv is a little tedious unless you know exactly what you want to watch.  Love the Netflix rec that says based on your rating of .... we recommend this.....last, I know there was some brouhaha over Prime membership prices, but I still think it's has offered very good value for me.", "Date": "April 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best in class Amazon tablet!", "Author": "American Shopper", "ReviewID": "R32J0G6YVC4YSI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" is the best tablet i have ever owned!

So why in the world would I even consider a Kindle when the command line is where I live on computers.  Because I'm tired of hauling dead tree books around.  And, after years and months of wavering, I went ahead and decided to try one--the biggest one...because I don't like \"little\" and I don't like plain.  Well, the shock of the icon driven system lasted about a day.  And, yes, while I'm still learning all the ins and outs, it's very user intuitive. Plus there's that magic instant live help if you're near a wifi connection. (And they really do answer instantly, too.)  i have no complaints, whatsoever...except for one small thing: It's addictive to read on a Kindle, and, if, like me, you're already addicted to reading, you'll find yourself even more so, because reading on a Kindle HDX 8.9\" is pure heaven. Think you read fast now? You'll come close to doubling your reading speed, if you're anything like me.  No page turning, no stopping when you need a sip of your favorite beverage (get an otter box for it, too, btw). In short, this machine revolutionizes reading.  My one OTHER suggestion: get a couple of those packages of styluses for it. It will make it easier for you to navigate around while learning the 'how-to's.

However, I have always stayed away from tablets as I work with workstations and servers.  I was finally drawn into the tablet market when I saw how well the Kindle fire 8.9 HDX could play videos.  My main concern was the cost of having to pay for 4G option to be able to have access to the internet all of the time.  I opted out of the 4G option and went with the 64 GB for the following reason.  I can sideload ( another way of saying copying files from your pc to the kindle via the usb cable) many of my MP4 movies and photo charts and mp3 music files ot my Kindle.  I can even make a folder on the kindle when connected to my pc using the pc to do the work.  So, you can have personal folders for putting all of you material into an organized matter.  You can also turn off \"auto update to personal cloud\" so you do not go over your personal 5GB of space free.  The battery stays charged longer when wifi is off (known as airplane mode which you can set on your kindle).  I had to order the 64GB directly from amazon as Best Buy does not carry the 64GB option.  I have placed a lot of charts, books and personal videos and personal music files on the kindle and still have only used up around 5 GB of space with around 49 GB still available.  The 64 GB model actually uses around 5+ GB of system memory so you end up with around 58 GB available for storage space when you first turn it on.The back camera takes a very high quality movie file in mp4 format.  It played back upside down at first on my pc but I used premiere to flip the video and exported it to a straight up video.If you take a picture with the back camera you will get a very high quality photo.  The catch is that if you email the pic to yourself it will be of a size around `1600 x 1200 picture.  If you hook it up to your computer via the usb cable then you will find it under a Dicom folder looking for camera then look through the subfolders and the file will be located.  copying from the dicom folder to your pc will end up giving you the maximum size of the photo without being sized down.  So it is extremely high resoulution at 300 dpi.Also if you want to turn off the auto to personal cloud  you will go through the settings device storage personal movies settings and buried that deep is the option to turn off auto load to personal cloud.  recommend you turn that feature off.The speakers give you great audio for personal use while you may need to use an external speaker for a louder sound.  In mentioning this the Bluetooth external speakers around 49 and below do not play any louder than the speakers you all ready have so you do not need to purchase a blue tooth speaker unless of course you get a high end one with high gain at 100 dollars or more.I would recommend this (64GB) to anyone who has lots of mp4 videos and charts and pictures and music to sideloadI played netflix on my kindle via the wifi in Books a Million and it played great.  No dropouts.  Make sure you go through the kindle store to get the right version.

I have owned several ipods, an Ipad2 10\" and an iPad mini.  I still have the ipod and the mini, and when my Ipad2 went on the fritz, I was debating whether to replace it with an iPad Air or a Kindle Fire.  I have always believed the ipad was superior and the Cadillac of all devices.  But the cost!  And I hate iTunes.  Apple does their updates and they never seem to care if their customers are having problems or not.  If something goes wrong with your device, you had better have an extended contract, because they won't fix anything.So, tired of Apple and iTunes, and all the hassles that come with it, I decided to look into Kindle.  A friend gave me the Kindle Fire HDX with 64g as a gift.  My first impression was OMG at the beautiful screen.  It is so clean and clear and just gorgeous!  A little smaller than a 10\", but come on.  Not really noticeable.  Watching movies and everything else is just plain great.I was very surprised that a lot of my Apple products automatically synced with Kindle with no hassle whatsoever.  I also have a Energi charger for my iPad that also works with the Kindle!  I was amazed.Mayday, where you have access to 24/7 help, is awesome.  Where else can you get service like this?  Try and even find a live person on Apple to help you.  I dare you.  I was having trouble with setting up music and they walked me right through it.I found it difficult to figure out setting up music and movies.  I was used to iTunes and I just couldn't figure out the Cloud Player.  I find it sort of clumsy, but after I figured it out it was no problem.  Amazon books and music are cheaper than iTunes.  I have an Apple TV and now Amazon plays on there as well.I read that getting 64 gig wasn't necessary.  Well, music and movies and photos take up most of your space.  Even though Amazon doesn't allow you to have a ton of videos on your device, we always end up using more space than we think we will.  On my Apple devices, I have my music and audiobooks on my ipod.  I put my photos on my computer.  The rest goes on my Ipad.  With Kindle, I can pretty much put it all on one device, if I choose to do so.Amazon Prime does not have the movie and tv selection for free that Netflix or Hulu have.  They need to work on that.  But the free shipping more than offsets this little glitch.I also love Amazon because you can get help.  If something goes wrong or you get a product you don't like, they make it right.  You get your money back and they help you and they appear to listen.  So I am a big Amazon fan and always will be.  In this day and age, customer service is important to me.Lots of neat little features.  Too many to go into here.I do not like the email, the way it is set up.  Confusing and just pretty much hate it.  I get emails much quicker on my ipad. Don't like the keypad.  It's a little different in that the space bar is small and there's a period next to it, so I keep hitting the period.  Little stuff I don't like, and it doesn't matter in the scheme of things.I don't have an Ipad Air, but from what I've read, it's probably awesome.  But I got 64 gig of memory and an awesome tablet with wonderful features for $439 on a Kindle.  Try buying an Ipad Air with 64 gig and see what it costs you.I think it all comes down to what do you want from your tablet, which will probably last you about three years.  If it doesn't go bad, technology will move forward and you will want to replace it.  I think Amazon hit a home run with their Kindle HDX.  I have had it a couple weeks and I absolutely love it.  Oh, and by the way.  I did not get the Origami case for it.  I bought a bundle called DigitalsOnDemand and it gave me the most awesome leather case, sleeve cover, stylus pen, USB cable, chargers, etc...  a steal for the money.  The screen protector was a piece of junk, so I got the Moshi iVisor XT.And best of all.  Try it and if you don't like it, send it back.  You can't go wrong.

She asked if she could take over my screen I told her by all means so bless her heart she did everything she could to connect it for me, she told me I had to get a number from my IP what ever that is so I call the telephone service they gave it to me, well I hit the mayday button again, this time an older man came on I told him what the little girl did and about IP he said I didn't need that he took over in 10 seconds it was up and running.

Price, need a tablet, want a tablet, buy most your products off Amazon.When I first got it, I was in need of downloading a file manager or else I was stuck wondering how to access them. My head was hurting at trying to find apps I might actually use. My head still hurts while attempting to find games I would like that are both paid and free. No Google Play store, so Amazon forces you to buy their products. There are ways around this, but it has been a few weeks so far and I have not even found many apk files I am happy with. I swear Amazon would sell nearly 10 times more tablets if their tablet were already rooted, and I would be willing to pay an extra $50 to Amazon for this feature.Samsung Galaxy phones are rooted and I buy things from Google Play because there is more, but I also use Amazon shopping app for when I am not at home. If Amazon were to contract for Google Play on their tablet, it would solve at least 80% of my problems with this thing and likely make Amazon a ton of money off Google's apps through the tablet. Of course, some CEOs of Amazon might not consider this, or there might have been contract negotiations but they were not in agreement. Could just be that CEOs are not the brightest in the company.I love Amazon, I love most of the ways they handle their business. I just do not like some of their marketing schemes, or most of them. With talks of Amazon now in favor of closing off online tax loopholes they once used to gain their wealth as a company, to an increased yearly subscription fee which is marketed mainly for their video services, to the best of the low-priced tablets forcing you to spend money on them even though they can make more money by catering to the consumer's wants.I bought my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" Wi-Fi 64GB for a decent price. I think the current price is steep, and would suggest buying for substantially less until they can either \"root\" it or add Google Play so that you feel the need to use it more than you think you might. I was thinking of nearly selling it back to someone just because of the headache. Do yourself a favor though, and take a look at it carefully if you know someone who has this.The screen is bright, you can get many apps still off the web built in to the software, and overall am satisfied with this machine only because I know my way around roadblocks with computers and phones. If you like to read, watch movies, browse the web this is a great tablet. If you like to play games or are not much knowledgeable about current tech, I suggest against buying this. Oh, and it only seems to use keyboard controls, not gamepad controls.

This means no Mp3 store, and no video streaming for me. This could be a showstopper when contemplating the HDX in my situation. I've had every Eink Kindle except the Kindle 1 and the big DX. I've sold my old models when upgrading to the newer device. My most recent Eink Kindle was the Paperwhite 1 3G. When upgrading, and passing on to my son the Kindle Fire HD 1, 7\" to get the HDX 7, the latter gave me such a good reading experience (in addition to the much improved browser, speed and form factor) that I sold my Paperwhite 1 3G without upgrading to the Paperwhite 2, and switched fully to reading on KF HDX LCD. I had to get used to it, but I read several hours per day, without complaint and the only gripe I have is the lesser battery time compared to an Eink Kindle, although the lighting has speeded up the drainage in the Paperwhite.  In practice, the battery life is quite sufficient to last a full day of reading and surfing the web. When comparing the HDX 7 with larger tablets in shops, I found the bigger screens very comfy for reading and surfing. That made me buy the HDX 8.9. I thought for a long time about buying the ipad mini retina, but the HDX 8.9 had a bigger screen for less (32gb version) and the awesome integrated Amazon experience and after sales. Plus, the Kindle reader software  is the best, more optioned out, on a Kindle device. The geographical mp3 and video restrictions I took for granted, because I mostly read and surf. Plus, Spotify takes care of the music streaming for now.I'm very pleased with the HDX 8.9, it is as fast as the HDX7, and the screen is even better, in particular the more even gray reading background. The text sharpness and colors are incredible. The overall size is not too big, though the HDX 7 disappears in you hands and flips into a coat pocket and has the edge in that respect. The 8.9 weight is low, even with the wonderful origami cover. The camera is good, and the speakers are the same good quality as the HDX 7. The 8.9\" screen really opens up an Ebook page, and web surfing is luxurious compared to a smaller screen. Compared to the newest iPad models screens, the HDX 8.9 does not disappoint, to say the least. To hold, the HDX 8.9 is more comfy than the Air, lighter and less slippery, and even, in my opinion than the iPad mini. On a personal note, I always liked the Fire Home screen better than the somewhat \"paler\" iPad home screen with the smaller app icons. The slightly compromised handling compared to the HDX 7 is a compromise that comes with the bigger screen. For me, it is worth the trade off.

It's slow, it can screw up page rendering by placing graphics over text, it's inflexible to font size adjustment (a BIG use-case Amazon should know better being a book company), and it can make font blurry upon the end of scrolling a page (and won't sharpen the font unless you tap on the screen a couple times).  I've tested tens of websites using the Kindle HDX 8.9\" via the Silk browser vs laptops (Macbook and Win7, a fair comparison because many tablets are replacing laptop purchases) from Facebook to worldbank.org to programming sites to wikipedia to government sites (ex. cdc.gov) to search sites (like Yahoo...this case it doesn't seem to work as well holding the tablet in landscape mode) investment sites (ex. The Motley Fool). They all get screwed up somehow, some-way, even if the screw-up is just crazy-slow page loading (probably partly due to how Silk traffic gets redirected to Amazon servers). This is a big problem for a device like this because a core competency of tablets are web browsing.Thus, I give the product a low ranking and I will most likely return it to Amazon because Amazon does not provide web browser alternatives on their app store (which I don't blame them, but then the company better deliver on an awesome web browser solution, which the company certainly does not).  It pains me to say this, because I really like the potential of this device, I just cannot get around justifying an almost $400 tablet with crummy web browsing that you really have no work-around solution (like try an alternative web browser).If you want to read further, below is a specific example of one site and example issues I run into and then an example on how Silk could be better.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Goto http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/computersciencetheory/sortcomp.html (yes, I work in computers).Problem 1- tiny font. Even setting the Kindle OS settings to \"big font\" will not fix the font. Yes, I can zoom in w/my fingers but then I have to always side swipe and scroll the screen to read the text.  I want Silk to be able to increase the font settings and re-render the page so the font fits within the viewable window.  This is something Chrome, Firefox, and Safari all do well via \"hold Ctrl key, then hit + +\" key sequence on laptops.Problem 2.- Silk does give you the option of hitting \"reading view\" button, IF the button it actually appears for that page (does not always happen). For this page it does.  Sometimes the \"reading view\" button does provide a good reading experience. however, not in this case.  Two problems occur: 1. Scrolling the window and when it stops there is nothing but blurred, almost unreadable font.  Tapping the screen a few times seems to correct it.  2. It makes the main text font SMALLER and cannot be adjusted at all (no zoom and the 'increase font key' only adjusts the title of the page).How I would like Silk to work?  A good start is exactly mimicking the wikipedia.org phone app you can download to the HDX device for every web site Silk encounters (not just wikipedia web pages).  For a phone app, the wikipedia does a pretty good job re-rendering wikipedia pages and sticking graphics in the right place when you increase the font size on the HDX (I set it to 300% font size and it's plenty easy on the eyes).  It will be easy to see the shortcomings of Silk browser by just surfing and clicking wikipedia pages (and comparing it to either the wikipedia app running on the HDX or a web browser on a laptop).", "Date": "February 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Cajun", "Author": "Robert C.

The screen resolution and color is dazzling.  Connect to the Internet, play downloaded games or music, read books, or take photographs or video - it does it all.My suggestion - buy an e-book user manual, install the Kindle Reader app for PC to your computer, and then download the manual to your computer (we bought \"The Kindle Fire HDX User Guide\" by Charles Tulley ($2.99)).  Take the time to read the user manual BEFORE you futz with the device.The Kindle Fire HDX is pretty intuitive..... any tech-savy teenager or twenty-something will figure out the basics in just an hour or so.  But, if you want to save yourself grief, read a user manual and find out how to do things correctly.  That way, you won't end up with a frozen or goobered device,  the result of doing something horribly wrong (like a bad sync with Windows Media Player).Users should also be aware of the re-boot process..... holding down the on/off button for a full 20 seconds;  it will back you out of many (if not most) problems that you'll encounter.Finally, bookmark the Amazon.com \"Help\" and \"Help Forum\" sites for Kindle Fire HDX on your computer.  The answer to just about any question, and solution to just about any problem, can be found on those sites.Overall:  Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\"......  it's just amazingly excellent.Final Thoughts:  You really need security software on any device that connects to the Internet.  We downloaded the free ESET Mobile Security app from the App Store.  If your Kindle has 3G/4G wireless capability, the ESET software also provides an anti-theft feature.  If your Kindle is only WiFi capable, consider the free Locked and Found (Geek Squad) app to remotely lock and help you recover your device if it is ever lost or stolen.", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "MAJOR TECHNICAL ISSURE-FOR ME ANYWAY", "Author": "CookieCocoChanel \"KMH\"", "ReviewID": "RVRMSHW51JAM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My second kindle fire has 64GBP.

Here are some thoughts1) The screen--its pretty amazing.  Bright and clear with great colors, and its very high resolution.  I believe its a low temperature silicon on LCD screen like the nexus 7.  Its really good. It makes the solid ips screen of the LG  G 8.3 tablet look tame by comparison.The source material is important--but streaming episodes of sherlock or the movie D13- Ultimatum looks amazing. Lower res stuff on netflix not so much, but if its quality video, you will not be sorry.  I could see the pores on Martin Freeman's face!  Just imagine if Edward James Olmos was on Sherlock!2) The sound--the speakers are good and louder than most tablets--surely way louder than the lg 8.3 tablet or the nexus 7. But they could be louder.  Why are they on the BACK of the device and not the front?3)  Construction-high quality--for plastic is impressive and yes, shockingly light.  I am a bit confounded by the button placement, which forces it to be in landscape orientation more than portrait, but its not a deal breaker.  Fortunately its so light it makes for different orientations still pretty easy--and way better in this regard than the samsung galaxy note 10.1 2014 edition (and its much lighter)The snapdragon 800 processor in this is a beast and is very impressively fast and responsive.  Plenty of horsepower here for most everything you can throw at it.4) The software--this is really for Amazon consumption of media--be it audio, songs, or video.  Its not really an android tablet although android powers it--no access to google play store.  For productivity....I think you will have some issues.Given limitations in video downloads from the amazon store and the size of the amazon app store vs the google play store, I'm not sure if you need a 64 gig tablet--this one seems to be best as a home media streaming device, not a road warrior, but I will revise the longer I have it.Aside from a few minor quirks (button, speakers) its a winner. Just keep in mind--it does not have access to the google play store so it is NOT really an android tablet--it has a different function.I guess you can try to hack the tablet but it will void warranty and its easy to ruin it in a lockup or \"brick\" the device and then you are out of luck.

It is faster than any of the others.  It has a display unmatched by others.  The resolution is so good that I do not have to put my cheating glasses on to read the screen.  If the screen output is too small a little expanded pinch enlarges it.  All together usage boils down to needs.  While 16GB is fine now, I can see where it would not take too long to need 32GB and while I do not now have a need to use the Kindle for a phone it could very well be handy at some later date.  The cameras are far better than several dedicated point and shoot cameras I use although it is not quite as good as the Coolpix 820 but that's an unfair comparison.  The Kindle's internet is so much faster than my desktop and laptop computers are.  In short it is a growing element on each of us here and we thoroughly enjoy using it and its applications with a positive outlook for tomorrow's adventures.Original comments:I have had this Kindle for only a few days and I have found it to be better than I imagined.  It is fast.  It has beautiful resolution and it is so good that I do not have to wear glasses to read the written words or graphics.  It is light and easy to hold.  Battery life is better than many of similar size.  The front and back cameras do a surer job and with its High Definition output I was astonished at the quality of the pictures.Right now I am simply getting to know the Kindle and it is a pleasure to keep its company.  It pairs quickly with Bluetooth and connects faster.  WiFi works well and has not kicked me off yet.  So far I have used about 36% of the 16Gb memory and could easily exceed that unless I pay closer attention.I readily admit to being a dummy now; however, with continued examination and exploration I can see no reason to change my initial rating other than to find more of the internal goodies.  Amazon and its partners did its customers a fine service and presented to them the top tablet.  There may be other tablets that rate higher by one service or another but each that exceeds the Kindle Fire HDX cost a whole lot more and does not have flexibility.In a few days I will update this to include any additional observations and thoughts.", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "So far so great..", "Author": "kevo", "ReviewID": "RXYT7CIGBX6JE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm currently test driving the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" via Amazon's 30-day free trial.

I bought the 64 GB version without advertising and I couldnt be more happier with it. The amazon market place works great, although more apps need to be brought on. You still have your essential apps that most people would like. I do think they should make a device that will be able to use Second Screen instead of needing a 2013 Samsung TV or a PS3. They do have devices that work with MirrorCast but I would like the features that come with Second Screen since they did not include a mini HDMI port this time around.

I haven't had any issues with the device, but it is an electronic so I am sure it will freeze up or get hung up somewhere down the line.

It does everything I want it to for a much lower price (Even though I got it for free). I did have enough points for an IPAD but I still chose the HDX. The sound is so much better than the IPAD, the picture, in my opinion is better,  The only thing I don't like is that Amazon does not have a NOOK app. I wanted to retrieve my NOOK books, but I suppose it is good business not to promote a competitor.

I love this tablet and upgraded to if from a Kindle Keyboard e-reader.  I thought long and hard about how I would use a tablet and have very few issues with going into Amazon's \"walled garden\".  The only reason for 4 stars is the lack of Google Drive (Google Docs).  If I can sideload this and it works, I will change to 5 stars.  I don't care about the other Google Apps because the Kindle offers good alternatives for e-mail and calendar.  I also do not use Google Books or Music.  I purchased the 16gb model because I get all of my video entertainment from Netflix via streaming.  I am heavy into Kindle Books and keep most of my books in the cloud (keeping about 50 on the device at one time).  I downloaded FBReader for ePub books and may sideload Nook Reader because my wife is a Nook HD+ owner and may need access to her Nook library.  I do know about Calibre e-book management software but complicated books such as 3000 page bibles with thousands of internal links do NOT convert well from ePub to Kindle.The hardware is OUTSTANDING, the price at $50 off was OUTSTANDING and the \"Walled Garden\" is more of a nuisance and not a deal breaker at all.

The weight of this tablet, as compared to the new iPad Air, for instance, is incredible. When you compare the two tablet's weight versus their volume, the HDX would be equal in weight to the one pound Air if it weighed 15.5 ounces. But it doesn't; it only weighs 13.1 oz!Thinness? The iPad air only has a two one hundredths of a millimeter advantage.The screen is just flat out brilliant. Watching movies and playing app games on this tablet is superior to everything else I own.The last thing I would add about the specs is that the more I use it, the better I like the size. I have a 10\" Nexus 10, a 9.7\" iPad, an 8.0\" Samsung Note, and a few 7\" tablets. For the combination of size, weight, and useful portability, I like the 8.9\" of the HDX best.BUT, the most important thing about this new Kindle tablet is the increased usability. It just flies through everything and all the moves I want to make are much simpler, more intuitive than the 8.9 HD.

During a technical support call, their rep said that \"The HDX has been experiencing issues with connecting to WiFi in high-traffic environments.\"  Amazing Amazon, exactly what has been happening.  They sent me another unit to test.  Same issue.  When I pressed them to fix the issue (because I do not want to send it back), they said they were a \"customer centric company\".  I asked if they had looked at their own webpage and the 40+ pages of customer comments on the WiFi issue, the customer service rep would not validate.  But yet she said that they are a company that focused on reading and listening to their customers' comments and feedback.  Contradictory.  When I asked for an response, she said she would investigate and respond.  Here is their response ...\"I'm sorry, Amazon.com does not comment about rumors or speculative news reports. We haven't announced any plans to update the wireless capabilities on the kindle devices as there is not a known issue at this time. Furthermore, we cannot speculate or disclose information about what another customer may be facing.

The 8.9\" was PERFECT for me. Not too big, but bigger than the \"mini\" tablets. The weight was super light and easy to hold, and the feel of it was great. The back was sort of rubberized which was nice. The display was beautiful and the sound.The Cons however, were too much to get over to consider keeping it. The product does not allow for much customization as far as wallpaper, screen saver, icons, etc. I couldn't put things where I wanted them. I also was not happy with the operating system itself. It was almost too user friendly. The system ran quickly, but just not \"up to par\" with other current systems out there. I have a Samsung Galxy S4 phone, and couldn't stop comparing the two. My biggest complaint though, is that is does not allow many of the most popular \"normal\" apps available. I was aware before purchasing that they did not have the vast amount of apps as on Google Play or the Apple store. However, I couldn't believe that I couldn't even download Dropbox! One of the main reasons for getting a tablet was for me to put work files on it when I travel. I was going to use Dropbox for this. I couldn't do it! They also have blocked most Google branded apps. So it did not sync well with my Google accounts. They had a gmail app, but it wasn't up to date with the newest style so things would look different from my phone to my tablet.Overall, just very frustrated with the Operating system setup, look, and the lack of apps. Also annoying that you have to pay extra to REMOVE the ads! I had to return it. I ended up buying the brand new Samsung Tab Pro and LOVE it. The size is a tad smaller and weighs a BIT more, but It is much more \"modern\" and works so much better!

The responsiveness of most functions is lightning quick speaking to the quality of the microprocessor and graphics card. It is extremely thin and light as well. I like the plastic back as well as putting this a tablet on a table doesn't have to enduce scratchy sounds. The ability to combine Amazon Instant Video and Prime Video in one unified library so I can rent or watch movies is priceless and is the reason I have wanted this device for so long. Book buying is obviously the Amazon bread and butter and it's done well. Buying magazines is also a very nice and an easy experience.  There are two downsides so far is that 3rd party apps and games are not up to par with Apple, but that is not really that important for me.  Also the Silk browser can definitely be improved.

This feature works pretty damn good. See:dmediamomDotCom/2013/12/11/are-you-using-the-kindle-fire-hdx-dictation-feature/2 - Screen, duh! It *is* nice and everybody has talked about it.3 - Keyboard, especially \"long-press\" for numbers and special characters.4 - There is a scrollable word correction display as you type that would be annoying on an android phone but work well here.5 - Battery charges to 100% overnight and I have never gone below 50% with the exact same usage I gave my laptop every day. But I do not remain tethered to it like some people that I know. As for playing games, although I had about a dozen on the HDX I did not find one addictive enough to play for more than just a little while.The Bad (FYI, submitted to Amazon's returns-feedback email address.)1- Documents I copied over according to directions that the HDX provided after clicking on the \"Docs\" menu were not showing up in the docs section. I copied them over in individual year-dated subdirectories that the HDX does not recognize. It appears that, although folders (sub-directories) can be copied from laptops to Documents through Android File Manager (AFM) and are visible on the kindle through AFM, the Kindle software through the DOCS menu cannot see sub-directories (folders). I have several years of files on my laptop that reside in their respective years' folders. It appears the only option I have is to copy every year into the single Documents folder on the Kindle. This is unacceptable as it would make sorting (without renaming each and every file) impossible because most of the files have the same name. Sub-directories and sub-folders have been included since computers' existence. Leaving such a basic capability out (it is not even a \"feature\" but a common sense capability of all computing) makes the Kindle Fire HDX \"Documents\" menu item useless. This screams for a software update. Fortunately, I could see the document subdirectories in ES file explorer and in Kingsoft Office.2 - I also tried using the email documents option. The only problem with that is you cannot edit documents once they get to Kindle because double-clicking on the document pops it into Kindle like it was a non-editable book.3 - I could not watch live internet television due to I get the \"need to update flash player.\" Sideloading Adobe Flash works but audio/visual is out of sync. I tried with both Firefox and Dolphin. Forums here and on XDA were no help. \"Mayday\" rep said \"they are working on it and I will submit a ticket.\" Like that would help with a known issue.4 - Attempted to watch CBS's new series Intelligence.\" When prompted, I allowed Amazon's BETA streaming player to load but the video/audio sync is still off. Audio is before video. To confirm it was not my router, I put the Kindle HDX next to my laptop and started both of them at the same time. My laptop was perfectly sync'ed. [Note I was only offered to use this BETA software when watching CBS, not CNN or other networks streaming through the internet.]5 - The most disturbing thing to me is that after using Amazon's BETA streaming player for 30 minutes it started playing commercials! It even-numbered them in the top left corner one of five. The same exact feed through my internet router had ZERO commercials. I paid $15 to not be bothered with commercials but yet I get them on Amazon's BETA streaming player! I don't care if it is a beta player. I am not going to be a beta tester after paying nearly $500! This was the final straw for me deciding to return the HDX.\"Mayday\" rep had not heard of, nor had any notification of an Amazon BETA streaming player. Such things are to be expected from large corporations that typically do not inform Customer Service Reps about BETAs or updates. However, even after the rep put me on hold (meaning she was asking someone else), she denied any knowledge of any such \"workaround\" and suggested I sideload Adobe Flash. I explained I already tried that.From my career as a Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 CSR and trainer in hardware and software support I know that even the best CSR's will not know everything if they don't think outside of the box and keep asking questions from \"veteran\" reps and their Systems people. Instead, I received the \"I apologize\" excuse ad infinitum despite the fact that I told the rep that she had no reason to apologize as it was not her fault that a basic feature expected from all such hardware is sorely lacking in the HDX.6 - If you are used to texting on your phone, type and edit in portrait mode. Typing in landscape is difficult. Swipe is not supported. Every piece of nonsupported software that I try to sideload eventually had glitches and problems trying to run on the HDX.7 - I explained that I could not find a way to change the internet background color on websites in Silk. The white background is hard on my eyes and the screen has a bad glare on it. She hesitated for a moment, checked her screen and advised that there indeed was no way to change it. I now know that changing to \"Reader View\" allows for font and color changes. The \"Mayday\" rep was either not sufficiently trained or was not provided hands-on testing after the training; either of which would have solved that problem.8 - As far as the Carousel is concerned, I want the same icons on it every time and I don't want them moving around based on usage frequency. And, adding the first photo from the photo collection to the carousel each and every time I go to photos even if I never looked at that first photo is really annoying. The rep explained that she understood and started to explain my options of deleting or moving each Carousel item. I explained that I already knew this as well as just scrolling the Carousel up to hide it but that lack of simple customization is frustrating.9 - If I attach a photo to an email and then later go out and choose photos from the top menu it brings up the email. Just a tiny bug that can probably be quickly fixed. This should have been caught before rushing this to market but this type of bug is typical for corporations that rush products to market to beat holiday (or other internal) deadlines.10 - Screen glare is bad especially on the Bezel. A color other than white might help the screen background but the only option to change the screen background is while reading a Kindle book or in Silk's \"Reading Mode.\" A black bezel is not recommended for any product if you will be using it in a brightly-lit room or where there is artificial light behind you. I notice no difference from my current laptop's 1680x1050 resolution except my laptop glare is much less.11 -  It is a fingerprint magnet. You need to leave a soft glasses cleaner cloth nearby.12- As almost all people have noticed, there is a pesky backlight issue. At first I thought it was because of the extremely sensitive screen but it makes no difference how long you leave your finger on the screen. Moving from screen to screen causes the screen to change from bright to dim with auto-brightness turned off. The screen is way too dim with auto-brightness turned on.13 - I could not access Kindle book discussions from the book menu. I do not think HDX is a complete \"fail\" or the software is completely broken but, even as a PRIME, movie-watching member, I can't live with it. You will need time and patience for its learning curve and for software updates if you need to do more than what it was designed for, reading books and watching Prime movies.Last, it was very difficult to hear my \"Mayday\" rep [name omitted for this review], even with the HDX volume turned all the way up and my home completely quiet. This may also be attributed to either not having her headset adjusted correctly or her non-English accent.  And NO, there is nothing wrong with my hearing! I got the definite impression that she was extremely uncomfortable in her job due to she was not prepared. Hiring bi-lingual reps strictly for their language capabilities and ignoring their lack of customer service experience and lack of communication skills is a Human Resources issue that I strongly suggest Amazon address if they want to keep their \"#1 Customer Satisfaction\" rating.\" Finally, when I asked the \"Mayday\" rep to help start my return process, she again put me on hold and a minute later another (male) rep came on the line. I could hear him saying hello to me but because the original rep left her system on hold, he could not hear me, nor could I see him. He continued to try saying hello to me with my hellos going un-answered for 5 minutes until the connection was lost. My email address was previously confirmed and the first rep accessed my account so they also had my phone number. When a connection is lost, common customer service dictates the rep attempt to contact the customer again. Not here! This experience was the poorest I have ever received from any company in my 30 years of IT experience.

I got the Verso Marrakesh Genuine Leather Cover for that, and love it so much.  It has worn around the Kindle and looks like a well worn vintage book.But with the new Amazon Fire TV, and loving it, I decided to go all out an upgrade to the larger 8.9\" HDX, and so glad I did.  The interaction between the two is awesome.  I love the screen swapping and basically using the Kindle as a remote.  The \"second screen\" is awesome when watching movies and tv.  Since Amazon owns IMDB, it literally pops up information on each actor as they appear, as well as various info in all scenes.  Like a non-intrusive commentary.  No more \"who is that actor\" as you just look at your HDX and there it is.Since 2011, I have collected thousands of free apps via Amazon's app store.  They give at least one app away free every day, so the value of the apps I have make it well worth the investment to get the largest storage available of 64GB.  But I love being able to listen to my 51,000 songs stored on my Amazon Cloud and listen on the Cloud player taking no device space at all.All apps and functions are blazing fast and quite a jump from my 2011 Kindle Fire.  I also have Apple's iPad, iPhone etc.  But the HDX is all about the Amazon experience for me.  I'm quite embedded with products and services by Amazon, and you cannot beat their customer service.  Which I have to also say that the HDX customer service feature called MayDay is quite amazing.  When setting it up, I had a question, and you click MayDay and an actual person appears on your screen.  They can see your screen and help you with anything, or show you features right in front of you.  They talk you through it, or you watch how they do it.  All while seeing who you are talking to in a video box in the corner.  They don't see you, but it would be an interesting option.I have the HDX on all day.  Either on stand-by or full use, I get a full day of use at home or travel.  I would say at least 10-12 hours of use.  I just charge when I go to bed.  I feel like I use the Kindles more than my iThings, but both serve different needs.  However go all out and go for it.  A great investment.

First off, if you are going to get a Kindle, get this one.  While I am not sure the screen upgrade is noticeable under the majority of conditions, the processor upgrade definitely is.  The HDX is much faster and more fluid, whereas the regular HD is noticeably sluggish and does not handle things like streaming movies nearly as well.  If you are using it primarily as a media device (reading, watching movies, listening to music) the HDX does pretty well.  It has a simple to use interface, the carousel makes it easy to get back to things you were recently viewing or using like tv shows or apps, Amazon purchased movies, music etc automatically show up--no searching for apps and hoping they work, just click on music or movies and they are there.  If you want to watch Vikings using the History app it actually works, whereas the ipad hangs most of the time (the Dell doesn't have the HC app but you can just go to the website and it works fine--the Dell is much faster/more at home on the web than the others).  So while the Ipad has more apps, they are much more likely to not work from my testing, whereas the Kindle ones, though fewer, seem more likely to actually work.  Your basic multimedia apps like Netflix, Hulu, etc are there (though not Vudu at the time of this review).  There is a Roku app so you can use the Kindle as the remote for your Roku if you have one (which gets you a keyboard rather than picking out each letter when searching).  The speakers are quite good, noticeable on music compared to the ipad.  Main downsides would be a smaller screen than the competitors mentioned, and it is somewhat pricey, especially compared to the Dell Venue Pro 8, which has a larger screen and the more full operating system if you are looking for more of a netbook replacement.  It also seems somewhat slow to charge and doesn't seem to hold a charge as long as the others mentioned, which is somewhat odd given the smaller screen size.  The browser is somewhat cheesy and internet usage is slower than with the Dell/Windows device, probably on a par with the Ipad which is also somewhat slow (although when I say that it is comparable with the ipad using Mercury, Safari is pretty bad so the Kindle probably does better than the ipad using the default Safari).  The HDX seems to find and connect to networks faster/more smoothly than the Ipad, which again seems sluggish at that and tends to hang.  The only other con I can think of is for Android devices in general not just the kindle, and that would be the Big Brotherish nature of Android apps compared to say a comparable windows one (and we don't know on Apple ones, since they don't seem to even let you know what permissions you are granting).  An app that from the Windows side wants 1-3 permissions might well want a dozen or more from Android, and you are left wondering why some basic calculator app or whatever needs to have access to all of your contacts, identity, location, etc., so if you worry about such things you end up using a lot less of the apps than you might, even though they are available.  Still, if you want an easy to use no hassles way to watch movies, read books, listen to music, and occasionally browse the web a bit, the Kindle is the way to go.", "Date": "April 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\", HDX Display, Wi-Fi, 32 GB", "Author": "Donald Ngai \"Donald\"", "ReviewID": "R3Q5NV0TKTIOKX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I loved the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and couldn't wait to trade it in when the new version came out.

If I could I'd give it a 3.5 star rating, but I can't quite bring myself to give it 4 stars.  I was really, really hoping for this tablet to be better than it is.  While there are plenty of pluses, the minuses are just too significant.On the plus side, I love how sharp and bright the display is, and it is incredibly light (even after I added a bluetooth keyboard/case to it).  As someone who is very invested in Amazon products (on my Android phone I am all about the Amazon MP3 player and Kindle e-reader app), it is great to have a device that doesn't have all that Google Play bloatware on it, and I love that the music player and e-reader are integrated into the OS on the Kindle Fire (although there are a few things about the music player that could be better).But now for the downside (and there's much more downside than I'd like).  Firstlly, the tablet is glitchy.  I'm constantly finding that when I click on an icon on the home page, nothing happens, and I have to go up to the carousel to get the app to start (which is really annoying when the app I want to use is one I haven't used in a while, so I have to scroll through the carousel trying to find it).  And even more frustrating is how many apps I have that routinely crash.  This seems especially true for high end apps (like almost all of the games I play on it).So while I love the integration with Amazon, and have no complaints about the interface, at the end of the day Amazon needs to put a lot more effort into making their operating system more stable than it is.  I don't know if the problem is that FireOS is starting to be enough different from Android that standard Android apps aren't fully compatible, but whatever it is, it is something Amazon needs to address sooner rather than later if they want the Kindle Fire HDX to truly be a top-end tablet.", "Date": "April 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Absolutely brilliant!", "Author": "VicChik", "ReviewID": "R2PQOA1KSPIFZT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had been wanting to try the new Kindle Fire HDX and finally I did.

The Free Amazon App of the Day has only encouraged this situation. I find it strange that the younger ones rather watch Netflix on the tablet than on the television. I think it is because the image is actually bigger than the screen appears from the couch.The tablet works well as a chant/music e-reader. It is light enough to hold during an entire practice or Mass, and there is enough bezel to do so with one hand and not mistakenly 'flip' the page. The other hand is needed for my lame attempt at chironomy. The ability to digitally draw markings on the music is also a plus (use the free Adobe Reader). It also works well as a regular e-reader for the same reasons listed.I have yet to become that person that can \"do anything\" on a tablet and rarely uses the laptop. That day may never come. The keyboard and mouse have spoiled me, and the quick email-fb check is easier and more practical on the handy smartphone. I do, however, appreciate the occasional quicker web search when the two laptops are in use.I sideloaded Flash onto it and felt content. However, I have yet to use it for anything Flash related. Go figure.I have no iPad related regrets. The Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 is most comparable to the iPad mini (same width in portrait mode), yet it is lighter (good for one hand e-reading), has a brighter screen for outdoor viewing, is less expensive (good for the wallet), and offers up great free apps of the day (some apps that normally retail for $7 at the Amazon and Apple App Stores).So if you are looking for an alternative to the iPad mini, take a hard look at the HDX 8.9.", "Date": "April 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "much improved", "Author": "Dana G.

I have a lot of health problems,and my Kindle keeps me company and reading is my pass time,but one of my disabilities is my eyesight is getting really bad. The New Fire HDX, 8.9, has a nice sized screen, no glare, more clear, and a lot thinner and lighter. I don't have any bad things to say about either of them but this one is perfect!

It's completely eliminated the near-nightly fight over the main TV and DVR. The wife doesn't have to be relegated to the bedroom to watch something when we want to watch sports.Admittedly, the strength of this is as a content delivery device. I haven't really used it for office stuff and doubt it would be well-suited for that. But as a method to get books/movies/mags/TV shows, it's really unequaled. The real power isn't fully realized unless combined with Amazon Prime - seamlessly integrated into the operating system. If you have a bunch of Apple or Google Play content, the case for the HDX isn't nearly as compelling, but even then I think it's still a strong case on the combination of ease of use, perfect size, light weight, performance, and price. But with Prime, it's really no contest. Very satisfied. We use our Kindle HDXs (we have both a 7 inch and 8.9 inch) daily.The only thing I wish it had was GPS....you can still use Google Maps (no, it's not in the Amazon App Store, but it's fairly easy to add, along with Chrome, as the included Silk browser...well....kinda sucks) but it won't enable turn-by-turn directions since there's no GPS.

I've owned many Ipads and Android tablets. I've read many helpful reviews here (thanks guys) before buying this tablet. Just few thoughts(i) It's lighter than the Ipad Air; ok, I never held the air but this tablet is not feathery light for me. My kindle reader ($69) I think is \"light\". Not that this is heavy but I was not comfortable holding it with one hand.(ii) apps; right. I use dropbox a lot. I know I can side-load those apps whatever but at this point, I don't care. I do all my works on windows laptop. If I need to read something then I will use web to access those files. I just don't care any more. I'm sure Apple has unique apps that you need for your work and school...so then buy ipad. Simple. But for me. I don't use those special apps. So This HDX works out fine for me(iii) in the end, question is, what do you do with your tablet. For me, I read Kindle books and watch Free Prime Videos. I know Ipad is able to watch Prime. But again, this tablet makes everything Amazon content related matter easier. When I went to 3 day trip, I downloaded 2 TV shows and 1 video. With many Kindle book loaded, I felt like I was ready. And my trip was fun and exciting. I know those limit (2 shows) sucks. But in the airplane, I switched to books and watched videos when I had spare time during the trip. So it worked out fine.Ask: what do I do with my tablet? If it's Prime contents and Kindle books, then, you need to get this. If your work requires those special apps for ipad, then, you should get that.Also ask: how long do you keep your gadget? If you spend $500 + tax + accessories on cheapest Ipad, then, you should make or generate more income than $500. But as for me, I never used a device more than 1 year. So if I'm gonna upgrade every 1.5 years, then, I would get by with perfectly fine HDX 8.9. When time comes, then, I will buy newer one.I'm very happy as I read, read, and read on this and watch many cool prime shows (I think they have better TV shows like \"Vikings\" or \"Tudors\" than the movies). And I think $500 + for consumption only is too much.Only thing that I wish for HDX is that other manufactures bring out folio keyboard cases.Buy this.

Startlingly light, fast and responsive. Sure, the Appstore is lacking, but side loading apps is super simple. Mayday works perfectly, just as advertised.You can't get a better tablet, this size with this kind of hardware, for the price. Definitely recommend!----------UPDATE------------This is just a personal opinion, and I'm not going to dock a star or anything. I just don't like how the charger fits into the device. It sits at a kind of cock-eyed angle, sort of pointed up. I feel like I'm breaking it every time I plug it in to charge. Not a big deal at all! Just be kind of careful.ALSO! I'd recommend getting rid of the special offers. (which you can do at anytime, for $15 plus tax) I felt like it really drained my battery very quickly. Again, just a personal opinion. My original opinion stands, that this is the best tablet you can get for the money, and really is the best tablet I have ever used.----------UPDATE #2----------Finally having issues at a little under three months, I knew such an amazing device has to have a flaw. Starting 3 days ago, my Kindle started spazzing out (the only way to describe it). It wouldn't select the book I requested, instead it opened Silk and navigated me through 2 yahoo pages and a Wikipedia entry, all by itself. It freaked out while scrolling, arbitrarily zooming in an out of pictures on twitter and Facebook. While reading, it would highlight words and navigate me all through the reading menus and stuff. It was exhausting. I did a factory reset last night, thinking it was something I downloaded. This did not resolve the issue. So I called Amazon Customer Service today for help. Within 5 minutes, after explaining my problem, they offered to replace my device, which will be here by Saturday, 03/15. I am docking one star, because Customer Service does not attest to the quality of the device. I haven't dropped my Kindle a single time in 3 months, it's barely even been out of my house. These issues were just out of the blue and random.Other than this issue, the device was great and I'm really looking forward to my replacement and jumping back into my books and tv shows :D", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fire is on fire", "Author": "Barbara Z.

Prior to that I didn't have much use for tablets but this one has changed my mind and become part of my daily routine.First, the audio/visual side of it works very well for me. Obviously the HD display creates very sharp images and video playback runs smoothly, looks excellent (with a high-quality source), and I have had no complaints about the sound. I added the origami case and while some people say the design doesn't really affect the sound, I do think it improves it slightly by helping redirect it back toward you just a bit. Even without it, you can hear everything just fine.I can't really get into all the deeper details about how the tablet itself works except to say navigation is simple and easy for me. The carousel is a snap to customize as far as showing what you want on it with the rest of your apps elsewhere.I mostly use the tablet for e-books, some games, and Amazon Prime videos. I've also propped the tablet up in the kitchen to follow a recipe without having to print something out or go back to the CPU to double-check something.  I have always been a traditionalist when it comes to reading, preferring the physical feel of a book in my hands, but having it on a tablet compared to a smaller device has made me change my mind.  It's probably a standard option, but I also prefer being able to set it as white text on a black background since my eyes are a little more sensitive to bright things than usual.  It just helps keep them from getting strained.A major selling point of the device is the ability to watch video through Amazon Prime.  The simple fact of the matter is you aren't going to maximize the potential of the Kindle Fire without it, because it opens up a ton of viewing options when it comes to movies and TV shows.Not everything is free through the instant video service, of course, but there's still a whole lot of stuff you can access that way.  You just have to see what the options are for each film or show.  Some allow you to download directly to the device while others don't.This should be showing up in the right place, but I bought the 64 GB version, wifi only, because for the most part it's an at-home device.  When I thought about what I pay for home internet vs. what I'd probably be paying to stream or download over a 4G connection, it made more sense for me to get the wifi-only version and live with knowing that if I'm going to take a vacation or otherwise be out of town, I'd have to either download stuff directly to the tablet before I go or hope to have a wifi signal somewhere.As an example, I took an overnight trip out of town and even though I stayed at a place with wifi, I didn't bother getting it.  I just downloaded a few episodes of a TV show to watch and that was that.  I also took a two-day train ride that did not have wifi, and I was able to watch an entire season of a TV show during the trip.  The HD episodes took up about 3 GB each so I came pretty close to maxing out the storage capacity, but as soon as I finished watching an episode I just deleted it.Be aware that once you start watching a show or movie you've downloaded, if you're not connected you have 48 hours to \"verify\" things again or you won't be able to watch that particular download until you do.  This is really a great feature of the device, since you can actually watch downloaded stuff while being completely offline for a bit.  It made the train trip extremely convenient, and I also got through most of two e-books by the end of it as well.I find the battery life to be pretty much as advertised.  It holds up well even when watching a few videos in succession, though I often charge it when I'm not using it.The camera gives a good enough image, but the examples I've taken with it seemed to have a bit of a contrast issue compared to my smartphone or the actual camera I have.  I'm not the kind of person to go around taking pictures or video with a tablet anyway, so it's not a big deal to me.  The camera itself was hardly a factor in what I decided to get.One small criticism I have is probably not a device-specific thing, but it does bear mentioning.  I have it set to automatically update my apps, though from time to time an app will prompt me to update and send me to the appstore only for there to be no \"update\" option.  On a few occasions, I've had to uninstall then reinstall the app in order for the update to register.  The last couple weeks, at least, apps I had that problem with seem to have auto-updated fine, so this may be fixed.By the way, if you're concerned about the \"special offers\" being intrusive or anything like that, they're not. When you access the device, they're no more than a displayed ad that goes away when you unlock the device, and you're on to what you want to do.  there's a tab at the top of the home screen to view all offers if you want to.  You can also spend $15 (I think) if you want to have them removed, so you're not stuck with them if you originally buy a device that comes with them.Overall, for what I got the tablet for, it meets or exceeds my needs.

I own a Note 3, MSI GT70, Ipad4, Note 10.1 2014, and a few older tablets for reading including an underwhelming 2012 HD refurbished Kindle. I was annoyed with the old HD for many reasons and was going to return it until my son stole it for Kindle Free Time, which btw, is worth the subscription. However, as many people do who don't have multiple screen homes (Kindle HD 2012 was first and only at the time) I was annoyed by its limits and didn't see it's merits.Even with my plethora of fancy and infancy devices I missed Amazon's set up for books and video streaming. I could have got the all new version of the HD cheaply but I thought for a few dollars more having the most recent Kindle would've hurt, would have all the product support (os updates, lending library, and Prime HD streams). However, what I didn't know about was the free Prime downloads they added!!!!!Unfortunately this feature will only be amazingly useful on Kindle with higher memory. It makes me want to cry. :( If you want to store your music and have up to four or so 1080p movies downloaded for offline use 16 gigs is too small. It's the case for any tablet, and to be honest 32 is really very little. The os your apps and games will eat that space in no time. It's not like the olden days.Aside from the os eating all my space, I have to say if you're a Prime Member the HDX is a need. It's so lovely watching videos for free that were optimized for your device in impressive full 1080p. I had no idea how useful this would be for more than a bedside companion. No 4G or purchases necessary to enjoy a show while you're waiting at the doctor. In that respect alone, if you're a loyal Amazon subscriber regardless of the tablet this is a no brained thing you will enjoy.The old HD lags and is slow, but this model is fast. You can write accurately and with ease. The battery life might make you sad, but if you're reading I believe you have 17 hours. Which, is totally why you own a fire right? ;)The app store is still limited, and behind ios and android in updates and releases, but Amazon is working on getting exclusive games for its tablet owners like the Telltale Walking Dead series. Which is amazing...I'm pregnant and struggling with a lot of physical issues and have been confined to my bed so gadgets have become very important. I doubt I could rationalize spending $300 of tech money on an 8.9 or even a 7 inch HDX when for that I could purchase a Nexus 10 or 7, or even a used retina ipad mini, but I can't say I don't want one. (There is one on my wishlist).If you're new to technology and tablets you will love an HDX, if you're a loyal Amazon Prime fan and use their wonderful services then you will enjoy this. It's fast. So fast, and streams in true HD with proper broadband connection so you will only miss the downloads when you're mobile. We all know Kindle Ebooks beat all other ebooks, and Amazon makes the best reading app. It's still an impressive ereader, and the Goodreads integration makes my nerdy soul happy.Cons are it's still a bit heavy for a reader, but a nice case with a strap should remedy that. No back camera, so if this is going to be your main tablet you will be saddened. No HDMI port but those are becoming dinosaur tech, and adapters or Miracast exists now for older tv's. No Google Play store... But I have to say something as a techie dork. Amazon I hope you're listening, you guys almost have it right. What do I mean?You're providing great hardware for discounted prices and adding amazing customer service to your product for no additional cost. *Slow Clap* You're producing Amazon Exclusive content that is available only on your devices, but you allow other devices access to your main features so you're not self isolating either like Apple can.The HDX is truly a step in the right direction of you guys can do the following:Open The Play Store. Trust your products and store, it's great. Apps are discounted, and fair. Limiting yourself in this area is hurting you. I believe you'll see the errors of your ways here. Have exclusive content and offer your own, and win the internet even more than you already have.Step the prices down for the bigger memory tablets. You're not selling machines, you're selling a portal to one of the best services out there. I save so much money using your physical stores alone!! Your videos are beautifully optimized. Your tablets are now impressive, and no one can best your customer service for the services you provide. So, since you're selling physical products, movies, and exclusive content take a bit more of a hit on them HDX tablets so the service is available to more people everywhere.Allow us to customize the carousel. We know it's a Kindle, but give us some options. Let us display a book collection up there instead of all the recently opened things. Remove from carousel is one of my least favorite things. I don't mind the special offers, because there are great deals and recommendations there but allow us some level of customization and I don't mean those weird decals.Let Google into your hearts all the way. Give us a normal page or two with widgets. I love the folders feature.If you made those tweaks your tablet might win the internet completely. (Maybe usb 3.0 too)That all being said this is a great tablet for Prime members, readers, and streamers. The 16 gig HDX is worth keeping around for a long time, and I believe newbies and tech lovers alike will be happy with the hardware.If this is your only tab expect app store limits and some frustrations, but Amazon is really working to improve those things, and HDX owners will reap the benefits of this in the future. Music sounds great for back speakers and is the best I've heard from any non Bluetooth connected tablet yet. Price is still good. May Day is useful for even the savviest of us because it saves time. If you're not going to be a Prime Member, you want the biggest selection of apps and all of their updates immediately and this is going to be your main and only device... you're not a reader... or you're looking for a productivity or Jack of all trades machine this isn't for you. Don't buy it then give it a horrible review. This is a media tab. Movies, music, books, and shopping. All the best things in life. It does do some productivity but if that's what you need look elsewhere.When you pick up an HDX you're picking up well crafted fun. The pixels are so pretty you'll want to shed a tear. Amazon's media access is so extensive you'll want for little, and combined with other services, you may just want for nothing.If you get an HDX no matter what you will find things that will bring you joy, hopefully for a few years to come. I wish I paid full price for device help if it malfunctions (they all do) because dealing with Amazon directly is usually a dream, but I got a great deal.

This shouldn't be limited (but it is), especially when there was plenty of GB still available.I was able to obtain the OtterBox Defender Series for Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" (will only fit Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\"), Black, which is a perfect case for this.

This charger didn't work at all--the lightening bolt wouldn't even appear. So I gave up on those chargers altogether and ordered an aftermarket charger from a company that had good reviews. It charged the \"new\" kindle but again, only to 82%, even when charging overnight. But occasionally it will pop up to 100% randomly. I've given up on expecting the kindle to fully charge and am living with the 82% charge.Others have mentioned this other problem--it drops my wifi at odd moments.

I think it\u2019s a great device for a first-time tablet owner, but ultimately I think it falls short as an IPad replacement.I have first generation iPad that has become virtually unusable. There is nothing physically wrong with it \u2013 it just crashes continually because its memory can\u2019t keep up with \u201cadvances\u201d in operating system and apps since I bought it three years ago.  This problem plagues earlier generation iPad\u2019s and Apple\u2019s response is \u201cEOL\u201d \u2013 the device is end-of-life and they won\u2019t support it; buy a new one if you want one that works. I think Apple meant \u201cSOL.\u201dNot enamored with this attitude, I looked for an alternative and thought I had found one in the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. Great specs, beautiful display, most of the apps I wanted  (I thought) in the Amazon app store.  And cheaper (although it is a little smaller). And I think Amazon\u2019s a great company so I ordered one.The display is beautiful, and it was a huge pleasure to watch video on the device. I like my viewing on a big screen and never watch much on a tablet, but I had a bunch of waiting-around time the weekend I got the Fire HDX and binge watched some shows from Amazon Prime (Luther, Sherlock, Alpha House). Download was easy, video was terrific, and though I originally thought it was just a gimmick, I LOVE the X-Ray feature on the Fire HDX. Sound is good, too, although I mostly used headphones.I also love the cursor control when typing text on the Fire. A slider appears under the text box that lets you precisely place the cursor for editing, much easier to use than Apple\u2019s.The device was snappy, but not eye-wateringly fast, as I expected upgrading from the original iPad.I don\u2019t use a ton of apps, and before I bought the Fire I checked that a couple I use regularly on the IPad were available for the Fire in the Amazon App store. But being available doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re the same. For example, on the iPad I have the paid version of Words With Friends, but the only one available for the Fire is the ad-based version, which pops up an ad after every move. It also sometimes  will not let me escape from the ad without exiting the app.  Very annoying, and I would be willing to pay a couple bucks for the upgrade, but it\u2019s not available. I also use Zite (an online magazine) quite a bit \u2013 again, the Kindle version looks different (not a big deal) but also frequently hung up when I tried to play video from within the app.I also surprised to find the lack of customization available on the Kindle. Really, I can\u2019t put my kids\u2019 picture on the home screen or lock screen? I can\u2019t put shortcuts to web pages on the home screen? Well, maybe I can do that, but if so, I have no idea how, which brings me to another point of frustration \u2013 finding information on how to do things on this device.As far as I can tell, all Kindle devices come under the same user forum on Amazon. Whether you\u2019ve got an original Kindle, an HDX, or any of the e-reader and Fire devices in between, all the discussions are in one big lump. Makes for a lot of wading through irrelevant material to find what you need. For example, I was trying to figure out how to put a bookmark to a website on my home screen, so I could just tap that icon and go straight to that webpage, rather than firing up the Silk browser and then navigating to the website. Can I do it? I don\u2019t know. I found instructions on how to do this, but they were for an earlier Fire tablet (or browser version?) and the instructions didn\u2019t track to what I was seeing on the HDX. Eventually, I gave up. I also gave up on finding a comprehensive user manual for the device \u2013 the only one I could find on Amazon was a .pdf of the quickstart guide, and the \u201cUser guide\u201d on the device is almost as bare bones. Yes, I could have tried the Mayday feature but I really don\u2019t want to fire up an A/V connection and talk to someone every time I have a question about the device.Ultimately, the tablet didn\u2019t do \u2013 or didn\u2019t do as well \u2013 some of the things I was used to doing on my IPad, and the time I was investing in figuring all that out just wasn\u2019t worth the price difference between the HDX and the iPad. So, hating myself, I reluctantly bought an iPad Air and am returning the HDX.If this were my first, tablet, I think I would be very happy with it. In fact, we bought a Fire HDX 7 for my 11-year-old and she loves it.

They popped up several times  while i was playing Fruit Ninja and actually paused the game.We called Amazon customer service and at first the rep said that we didn't read carefully all the fine print. We told him that we got it from Best Buy, because the same model was $40 cheaper than Amazon, and they had no information anywhere about these \"special Offers\".  He was understanding, waived the $15, told us to restart the device and they were gone!That's the reason I will give only 4 stars. The sellers should be more upfront about these things.Otherwise, it was very easy to get started, since I had a first generation Kindle Fire HD.

The speakers are not as loud as last gen, but for a tablet I find them adequate for a quick couple of tunes on break or an episode of my favorite TV show before bed.I have occasion to use my HDX for up to 12 hours at a stretch at times and the battery keeps up quite well for reading or researching the occasional article on the net. The included charger and cable will keep you juiced up at a very pleasant rate as well.Bottom line: The kindle as a media consumption device does its job without a hitch. Highly reccomended.

I do have a business license for photography but do more free than for paid. My number one goal was to use this device for my photography to make it easier to view images then my excellent but small screen on the back of my Canon EOS 5D Mk-III. I wanted a very bright screen, highest resolution I could find, best color reproduction I could get, light and long lasting on batteries, and easy to use. I also wanted it to be easy to setup and fast for photography because, let\u2019s face it, if I have to wait to see my images on this I won\u2019t use it in the long run and it will become something to collect dust.So how do I feel about it so far? AWESOME! This device lives up to everything I had hoped. Even my wife enjoyed using it and wanted to learn more about the software (CamRanger). I do admit that in a very bright sunny outdoor area (used it yesterday in the mountains for a bridal shot) it is harder to see the screen. Now note I said \u201charder\u201d, not impossible. It was still much better than the screen on the camera and it allowed my beautiful wife to better assist me in my shoots. You can connect this with an Eye-fi card or with a CamRanger. I did both. (Go look up my name as a reviewer on the CamRanger). I do not recommend the Eye-fi for pros. It is too unreliable and to fussy.Bottom line: I would definitely recommend this to others for photography. I will always have it in my bag wherever my camera goes. It is also very enjoyable to use for surfing the net and reading the latest eBooks (I read a lot of photo how-to books all the time). It is beautiful, light, fast, slick, easy to carry and fun. And did I mention that the screen is downright gorgeous?Enough said.May this review help those who are trying to decide.

After the larger keyboard version and a smaller keyboard version for my purse this one is great.  My larger keyboard Kindle tanked after 3 yrs and 1000 bks and I wasn\u2019t as crazy about the smaller screen on my other Kindle. Now instead of needing 2 Kindles (one at home and the other in my purse) this version fits perfectly in my purse and isn\u2019t too small or too heavy. And no more clumsy book light attachments. My new HDX was money well spent. While I\u2019d like a larger screen this size works well enough. Thankfully Amazon has a forum and a Q&A; page to help with initial start up that I thought was a bit tricky. Guess I could have asked the May Day person for help but I haven\u2019t tried that feature out yet. The only negatives I\u2019ve seen so far (and I\u2019m still learning) is the s-l-o-w start up and the battery runs down quickly.  I\u2019ve only used it thus far to do a lot of reading and to play a game or two.  I\u2019m charging it up every other day.  I\u2019ve played around with a few free apps but thus far I haven\u2019t been all that impressed. Certain ones I hear drain the battery.  I was disappointed to learn quite a few magazines\u2019 only show lots of ads.  The web browsing is not as easy as I hoped it might be, certainly not as easy as my laptop. I\u2019ve yet to watch any movies but the color quality is excellent.  But for reading it\u2019s great, very happy with that part.

Why should I have to go through the hassle? Why can't you just update Silk to support flash, and give us a flash app yourself?

That makes 2 - 720 HD movies downloaded and with my other apps/books the device still has 5.3 GB available... so still plenty of space available. Due to download times I use 720 HD which is still an incredible picture quality due to the small size of tablets.

Amazon has replaced several our older KFs which were out of warranty since it was our first problem... that is incredible service.***  I used the Mayday feature and sure enough the response was just a few minutes... he corrected the audio problem quickly which I should have figured out myself in the first place.  He wrote on the screen since I could not hear him.  How cool was that...  and I believe there is no charge for online help even if it is out of the warranty period.Our family has the KF and the other top rated non-android tablet and love both...  one is just too costly for me, but apparently my wife can afford the more expensive one.Insert a product link[Cancel]", "Date": "February 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "great tablet", "Author": "CMOR", "ReviewID": "R20QBM9IDEMVDD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is great for reading and surfing the internet, watching tv,  & playing games.

Live Tech support could only suggest locking in the desired orientation (Options menu).

I had previously purchased my wife a Nook since she is an avid Barnes and Noble shopper, but since I primarily shop for books at Amazon and have purchased quite a few music CDs from Amazon as well, I figured that I might as well go with the Fire HDX. Another factor in my decision was that I had already downloaded the Kindle reading app on my phone and computers and acquired quite a few free books for my library. I am a teacher and having these available on my classroom computer appealed to me.So that is \"why\" I went with the Fire HDX. I decided on the top of the line with everything except for 4G coverage because I figured that I would always have enough content to keep myself occupied between wifi hotspots and would never need the Kindle to download something urgently enough to require it right then when I was not in an area of coverage.I am totally impressed with the display on videos, the music sounds great when connected to quality headphones, and I already have enough books to keep me busy reading for quite a while. I need to remember to utilize my 64gb hard drive since so far everything that I need is sitting in the Amazon cloud. I never was a big gamer fan, but I've downloaded several free games and a few interesting apps and being a traditional guy, I will probably stay with a steady rotation of those when I feel like playing something instead of trying to improve my mind by reading.If I would have to give any negative comment to this device at all, it would have to be that it occasionally doesn't keep up with the buffer on streaming and doesn't play perfectly with a few online video apps like Watch ESPN or CBSSports. So far, I have had only one instance of it needing to catch up with an Amazon Prime video but it wasn't a huge problem and obviously could be remedied if you went ahead and downloaded the video before watching.Speaking of Amazon Prime, it seems many people are upset because all videos are not available with an Amazon Prime subscription. I just started my trial and will spending the next 30 days checking to see what is actually available with Prime. If I cannot find enough of the videos that I want to stream for free, then I will simply discontinue after the free trial. I did the same thing with Netflix because their selection did not have the newest or best videos available for streaming. The same seems to be true of Amazon Prime but I will give them the full trial period before passing judgement.  I suggest everyone check out the videos that are available through Prime before jumping on that wagon.Anyway, the Amazon Fire HDX is everything it says it is and apparently every bit the competitor for the Apple Ipad Air or the Nook, with a display that tips the scales in favor of the Fire HDX.", "Date": "January 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "kindle", "Author": "joshua diaz", "ReviewID": "R3DX474QQ7G6U0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This tablet is just ok.

Upon deleting them the last movie would not allow me to delete it in the conventional manner so I re-booted and the screen responded with a question that basically asked if I wanted to restore factory defaults or continue to boot normally. I chose not to restore settings and continued to boot. I later went into the settings screen and found an alternative way to delete the movie without having to resort to losing my personal settings.Other than these issues, I really like and would purchase it again. The live help feature works great with knowledgeable and professional support techs. I perhaps should have asked them to assist me with the two aforementioned issues and still may do so.

I have had a original Fire, and 2012 Fire HD 7\". I wasn't really sure I could justify the upgrade this time, but I had wanted a little larger screen for a long time and really wanted one. I am glad I did. I had a little problem with the first one I received, but called and Amazon got me a replacement on the way immediately. I was able to use the first one until the replacement arrived and then sent back. This one is great. I love the great display, and I really love how light it is! I got a semi hard plastic shell type back for mine so it added almost no weight, after trying some other cases. I just slide that into a sleeve to put in my purse. It is so light weight for the size and is really comfortable to hold for long periods. I am a huge reader and listener of my Amazon Ebooks, so I love how seamlessly it works and syncs with my Kindle Paperwhite and other Fire HD. I actually had tried a Samsung Note for a few days, thinking I would try something different, but I am too much of an Amazon gal, and my books not being available to listen to easily for my commutes just was not working for me. The new Fire HDX is noticeably faster than the HD. I also love that it is much faster and with no interruptions when viewing Prime videos. I have had almost no problems with that. It sounds great and the videos are crisp and clear. I got a Bluetooth speaker I use some when I am up doing stuff around the house, so I can listen to my books or music. It is quickly becoming my constant companion. I was concerned about the lack of the Google play store just like many others. That is the main reason I tried the Samsung first. I do believe however, that the Amazon app store is improving all the time and for what I do, I have adequate apps. I do have a Samsung phone, so I do have access on it for anything I would run across that I couldn't get on my Fire. I think most people will be pleased. Give it a try!

I bought the Kindle for my kids because they have the option of the lending library and I can control their time on the device. I have an amazon prime account, which in this case, is a plus. All of my already owned apps via the amazon app store were automatically downloaded as well as any kindle books I've purchased in the past.  The amazon app store does not have near the breadth of the apps that the ipad is but they have the major ones for game playing including ones the boys really like like minecraft pocket edition, angry birds go, etc. The most limiting app store would be that for the windows phone. Not the case with this device. You can also buy amazon coins on amazon so you have purchasing power for any apps in the store and depending on how man you buy, I believe you can save up to $10. Assuming you are going to spend that much on apps. It's not good towards books.  The OS on the kindle is good. It is lightning fast, has all of the settings at your fingertips and I've had 0 problems so far.  It holds a charge as well as the ipad with consistent use and the charging port is easy to access and secure. I'm still getting used to the buttons on the back but I like that I cant accidentally hit the home button. I actually have to go for it. The nexus 7 is disappointing as far as battery life goes and the charging port. Within two months of having the nexus, I had to ship it off to have the charging port replaced. The ipad I've replaced twice due to a malfunctioning home key and the wifi not working at all. I have cellular service on the ipad but do not on the kindle. I almost wish I did to see how well it functions.  Kindle has an incredible photo editing program. The photos it takes are as good as those the ipad takes (I don't expect much from tablet devices) and I was shocked to see the variety of editing features the program offered without having to buy an extra app. You could make a meme, add stickers, crop, etc. Many things as well as sharing features. Kindle is not compatible with instagram yet, which is a shame. It just became compatible with windows in December of last year. Hopefully this will be resolved soon.  Also, the Kindle has the unique and convenient feature (like the nexus 7) of typing by swiping the word across the keyboard. It is amazingly accurate, fast and easy to use once you practice once or twice. Because of the size of the screen and the touch accuracy, I've used it often on the Kindle if I've needed to type.  The only truly disappointing thing for me which may sound trivial is the fact you cannot personalize the background or lock screen. I paid the extra $15 not to be inundated with commercials because ultimately this is my device, not Amazon's to sell stuff to me. Even if they are great offers, I shouldn't have to feel like I have to buy something if I want to turn the thing on for the kids, etc. There is a pin lock screen available, just like the ipad. It does not have facial recognition or pattern offered like the nexus 7, though.  Mostly, I have been satisfied with this device. I have no real complaints and I care about performance and the visual screen first. The screen is beautiful. I like looking at it better than my ipad. The reason I got the ipad over a year ago was for the screen. Now they have better options. However, I like my ipad for the apps.  For kids, for reading, for those with an amazon account, this is perfect!  If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.

Love It!", "Author": "t.holmes", "ReviewID": "R9R6OFXREQ4OX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I purchased my first Kindle Fire I was very frustrated with it because I didn't know how to use it and it was hard to find someone to show me how to use the tablet and the same when I purchased the Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  I found it difficult to even find a telephone number for Amazon so I could call someone to tell me how to use the tablet.  I complained to Amazon about the lack of not having a company or someone locally who could help teach me how to use the table.  I was really frustrated because I wasn't able to take good pictures with the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 since it didn't have a back camera.  Oh, but baby!  Extra! Extra!  Read all about it! I know somebody really loves me because I got the new Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 as a Christmas present! Let me tell you now about my new Kindle Fire HDX 8.9.  I am now the proud owner of a Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 and every time I use this tablet, it's a new day with a new play!  Kindle Fire has stepped up it's game!  I can take great pictures all day long because it now has a front and back camera.  I now am a believer, that for the price, IPADs don't have anything any more on Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. I love using the May Day which have live people showing you how to navigate the table.  The May Day People are fun to talk to and make me feel at ease. The Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 is much lighter.  I really love watching movies on my Kindle.  I like the new, improved \"Contact List\" app. The one disappointment with the new Kindle Fire HDX is the \"Office Suite\" that was advertised as being a integral part of Kindle Fire HDX 8.9  which doesn't seem to exist.  I'm not sure this app exist because there isn't an \"Office Suite\" icon on my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9.  It's been confusing as to why the \"Office Suite\" is not on the tablet as advertised.  May Day People weren't able to explain to me in a manner that I can understand why the app icon is not on the device and weren't able to clearly explain how I should use this app. Not having the \"Office Suite\" icon app on my new Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 is the only area where I feel slighted because that is one of the main reasons I purchased this new tablet. Otherwise, I most definitely am very satisfied with my new Kindle Fire HDX 8.9.  One other thing, Kindle Fire has also improved with the number of great movies and books that can be obtained if one purchases \"Prime Time\" each year. This is the first time I've purchased \"Prime Time\" since I began getting Kindle Fires. I am glad I paid the prime time fee because I've seen some great movies on my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. It's so much fun watching a movie on my Kindle while I'm lying in bed! With the Kindle Fire, one is able to store music in the cloud.  One last thing, on this past Sunday, when I visited my sister who was using her Kindle Fire HD 8.9 while I used my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9, we could differently see the big and improved differences in the newest tablet.

But a friend of mine got one and really liked it, and he owns about 15 tablets as well as develops roms for many of them.  So along with the offer to pay in installments, I decided to give it a try.First thing is the amazing light weight, and thinness.  It almost feels like it's going to break, it's so thin.  But it hasn't(yet :) ).  The power and volume buttons being on the rear take a little getting used to, but it feels pretty good once you use it a while.The screen, of course, is tremendous, with the high resolution.  And colors are very bright, as well.  In operation, the speed of the UI is quite good, I haven't really noticed any lag.  Apps load quickly, and games like Asphalt 8 and Modern Combat 4 play effortlessly.Not everything is perfect, of course.  Three things in particular i wish were different.  First, lack of an sd card slot is a con, although with the 32gb version I have, storage isn't a problem so far.  But if you had a lot of movies, normally you could play them off an sd card.  Of course Amazon wants you to use the cloud, but what about if you can't connect to wifi?  For me it's not a big deal but I can see it being so for some users.The second item is no HDMI out port.  Sure, it can use Miracast, but if you don't have a Miracast enabled tv, then you have to get an adapter, and they're not cheap.  This bothers me more than no sd card slot, but again, i have a couple other tablets with HDMI out, so not a deal breaker.Lastly, no Google Play store.  While I thought this would be really bad, the Amazon app store isn't totally lacking in good apps.  Also, you can enable adb, and sideload apps easily enough.  Unless an app needs to download additional content, everything pretty much will work.Overall I find myself satisfied with the device, it's super-fast, the screen is brilliant, and the UI is actually pretty good, with the carousel.  If you're already in the Amazon ecosystem, it's much easier to get more out of the tablet.

I bought it primarily to surf the internet and stream movies and TV on Amazon prime. I have been very happy with those features so far.Browser speed Some people have complained about the browser speed, but it has worked fine for me so far. I've used the HDX to stream a TV show off the internet, and there were no problems there. A screen did pop up saying I needed a flash player, but then another screen popped up saying I could use an experimental Amazon player, and that worked well enough.Screen fingerprintsSome people have complained about fingerprints on the screen, and this can be a problem in certain light. I may invest in a screen cleaning cloth.AppsThe app availability is not as good as the iPad, but I did not buy this to run a bunch of apps. I have an iPhone for that. I did download the Pinterest app and the Facebook app, and I have been satisfied with those so far.PrimeAnother complaint I have seen is the limitations of prime. I agree that there don't seem to be enough shows you can download to your device. Fortunately I have been binge watching The Good Wife, and it was available to download onto my device. It takes a while to download. I ended up letting the episodes download overnight. There are three different download qualities. At first I used the middle quality, but that took too long, so I started downloading with the lowest quality. I'm not really a picture quality snob, so the lowest quality was fine with me. I liked the shorter download time and less memory needed. I have the 16g and had no problems downloading 6 45 minute episodes. It's very easy to delete them as you go. I didn't mind the 48 hour watching window since I watched each episode is one sitting on an airplane.As an ereaderI have an earlier kindle that I use for reading, so I wasn't planning on using this as an eReader. My original kindle is not backlit, so I did end up using my HDX as an ereader while riding in a dark car. It was good for this purpose, but I prefer to read on my other kindle if I am reading for longer periods of time since it is not backlit. I like the dictionary function on the HDX better. It's easier to use since my other kindle is not a touchscreen. I liked how the two kindles synched via the internet, so I could keep my place in my book between devices.Button placementMany people have complained about the on/off switch and volume buttons being located on the back. I would prefer a home button on the front like an iPad, but I've gotten used to the back buttons.Overall I am very pleased with my purchase. I've had no problems with it whatsoever. I love how lightweight it is and how beautiful the screen resolution is. The battery life is great even when streaming. I also love how much cheaper it is than the iPad.", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "I am still unsure of my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\", HDX Display, Wi-Fi, 32 GB - Includes Special Offers (Electronics", "Author": "Kindle Customer", "ReviewID": "R3O3UA6RBW7TER", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this Kindle fire hdx as a Christmas gift to myself.

I would consider myself a power user that must push the boundaries of making a device do what I would like it to do.  I rooted my Nexus 7 so I can use apps like Titanium Backup Pro, etc.  However, I was getting tired of needing to root and deal with that headache and just get a device that works.  The Kindle HDX is a beautiful device and interface.  I have enjoyed it so far, but there are a bunch of App compatibility issues that I immediately ran into.I'll keep this short and maybe revisit and expand after I have had more time to settle in with this device.Pros:Beautiful display and I\\interfaceIntegration with Amazon contentHandles about 80% of what I want to do with a tabletBook reading has been pleasant so farSpeakers and audio sound really good coming from a tabletCons:Locked into Silk BrowserLast Pass seems a little weird - not tied to Silk Browser - uses an embedded Dolphin browser I believe - wish this was integrated into Silk with a plugin or somethingNo Google integration - you don't know you miss it until it's not there any moreLack of GPSApps in the Amazon app store are not the same revision as current ones in the Google Play storeThings like Candy Crush - since its an older version, I'm missing features I get on my Google based devicesStuff I purchased in Google Play I cannot easily get to Kindle Fire or if I do it might not be supported (if I sideload something)Price.  Due to being so locked in to the Amazon marketplace, I feel this device should be priced lower or I wouldn't have a problem paying more if more of my apps worked out of the box.In short, there are challenges that need to be overcome on a directional level from Amazon.  I'm not sure why developers or Amazon are not keeping Apps up to date or what is preventing developers from moving to the Amazon Marketplace, but if I were Amazon I'd be addressing these issues.  If I had more compatibility and flexibility I wouldn't have such a problem losing a few apps, but the percentage is too high for me to give a 4 or 5 star review as the current device and platform sit.Companies that try to limit what we want or can do with these devices are going to pay the price, by losing users and sales.  It seems Amazon is following Apple's model more closely than Google's.  I'm happy with a mix in the middle.  Considered sending this back to Amazon but I'll wait it out some more and see how things go.

My father received an original fire when they first came out and this is a definite improvement.  The way it works is basically the same meaning someone could upgrade with no issues but they will totally notice how much faster it is and how much clearer the screen is.  If you have prime, I would definitely recommend this device because of all the free shows and movies you can watch.  If you don't have prime then you will probably end up spending lots of money to watch things on it because you will want to use it all the time for videos.  The new mayday feature is brilliant.  This device will be used by a very wide range of people and some may not be very tech savvy.  This does not matter at all because if they don't know how to do something, all they have to do is push that button and someone will teach you at no charge.

I particularly like the fact that I was able to download multiple high-quality movies that I can watch comfortably using my Bluetooth headphones, on the device since I don't always have WiFi access. I already have moved 6 movies and about 40 books to the device and I still have over 20GB available space. I've also installed several productivity applications and, OK, a couple of games as well. I'm extremely pleased with the speed of the device (downloading a book over WiFi occurs in seconds) and the quality of the display and sound. I chose the 32GB version without special offers.

I am learning new things about it each day.  Since submitting my initial rating, I have no idea why my reasoning did not show up, but I have learned how to adjust text to speech voice speed.  The other issues I had were the inability to print web pages and the fact that the text to speech tends to stop at the beginning of a new chapter.  The volume is fine indoors but inside of a car, the road sounds tend to make it difficult to hear text to speech unless you have the device in your lap which is risky while driving.  In certain books, text to speech repeats the last word in a sentence.  This can be annoying.  I imagine I use text to speech more than the average person.

HDX, 8.9\"'s basic features. I use my Kindles mainly for watching videos and tv, as well as web browsing, shopping via Amazon and very occasionally checking email when not near my laptop or pc. My daughter, who is 12, is constantly using my other Kindle, so it's a good tablet for kids- very easy to use with the added security of parental control options. Something I neglected to mention in the video is the placement of the power and volume controls which are now located on the back of the tablet, along the beveled edge. I find this to be an improvement over the prior Fire HD version, on which these were located flush with the tablet's right side edge, making them somewhat cumbersome to use without feeling around or actually looking at them.", "Date": "November 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Super Display!

I did a bit of research on the different kinds of tablets available and most guides I read suggested considering a variation of this question.  I use my tablet primarily for media consumption.  My primary concern was picking a tablet that streamed videos through my Amazon Prime account. This left me with two choices: the Kindle Fire HDX or an iPad.  I chose the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 over the iPad Air because I could get the 64 GB Kindle for less than a 16 GB iPad Air.  I was also disappointed with the letter boxing on the iPad Air when it played HD movies.  While the Kindle has a smaller screen than the iPad Air, it has a bigger picture when watching movies than the iPad.  Perhaps the iPad uses more of the screen when playing TV shows and older movies, I don't know, but it only uses a portion of the screen when playing newer movies in HD.  The Kindle Fire HDX uses the entire screen when playing HD movies.  I regularly use Netflix, Amazon streaming, and Hulu Plus and have no complaints with the HDX's performance on this front.  The speakers are more than adequate for watching movies and listening to music.  I have no experience with other tablet speakers so I can't make a comparison, but the HDX speakers are well placed, clear, loud, and don't sound tinny.  Reading on the HDX is very easy.  I have the Nook, Aldiko, Moon+ Reader, and Comixology apps, and of course the Kindle App is pre-loaded on the HDX.  The HDX is quite light and easy to hold, in either portrait or landscape mode, for extended periods of time.  I'm very happy with the battery life as well.  I get 13 hours on a full charge.  On weekdays, after work, I can use the HDX for two days in a row before I have to think about plugging it in.  On weekends the tablet will last an entire day of almost constant use before needing to be charged.  I've only ran the battery down to 0% once, and I think it took a little over six hours to reach 100%.The biggest problem with the Kindle Fire HDX is the app store.  Since the Kindle Fires are closed off from the Google Play store I thought Amazon would focus on quality over quantity with regards to apps offered, but that doesn't seem to be the case.  There seems to be an abundance of cheap, poorly designed apps and a noticeable absence of certain popular apps.  The 1Mobile Market rectifies this a bit, but I still find the absence of some popular apps in the Amazon app store curious.  I would like a Google Drive app, but have to settle with accessing it through the browser.  With a little bit of research, I've found workarounds for most problems, but it's annoying to not have simple, direct access to apps other tablets have.  I'm also not a big fan of the carousel on the home screen, but I suppose some people may prefer it.The Kindle Fire HDX has some real limitations, but on the whole I am happy with my purchase.  If you want to use your tablet for work, you may want to do some more research to make sure the Kindle Fire will do want you need.  If you want a portable media player to watch movies, play music, browse the internet, and read books the Kindle Fire HDX is a good choice.", "Date": "March 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Had to return it.

The carousel interface is kind of neat, but more often gets in the way of finding the content you want to use at than assists in it.  That it tries very hard to direct you into purchasing new things rather than letting you get to things you have already bought and now want to use just makes it worse.  While some of the features can't be had anywhere else due to Amazon licensing terms (and the only reason this isn't getting 1 star) you know who you are if you want these.While I'll agree that a media player needs a nice screen, and this certainly has it, the problem is that the rest of its' technical specs are complete overkill for the job at hand.  You simply don't need quad-core, dedicated graphics, or massive internal storage if all you're going to be doing is reading books offline and streaming movies.  And boy, do they want you to stream over downloading.This is even further hampered by several bizarre decisions in the design.  Rear-facing speakers make it difficult to hear the thing even in relatively quiet environments without turning it up to the point where you will bother other people.  The keyboard and dictionary features are weak compared to Google's and Apple's offerings, making the touchscreen keyboard a pain to use effectively.  And the internal power management means that it often can't take advantage of the increased battery life - playing an HD movie drains the battery FASTER than a power cable can supply it.The Amazon app store is a complete joke.  My last tablet was an HP Touchpad, and before I installed Cyanogenmod the app store for THAT had easier, cheaper access to needed features.  When compared to Google Play and iTunes you just have to laugh.If all you're looking for is a cheap way to get access to Amazon content, consider the Kindle Fire HD - at over 200 bucks cheaper the minimal loss of resolution is probably justified, and you can actually connect that directly to an HDTV instead of needing an expensive new wireless setup of questionable utility (another strike against the HDX).  If you want a full-featured tablet, look at the iPad Air or one of the new KitKat-based Android tablets that should be coming out soon.Only buy the HDX if you seriously can't live without the ability to download a small subset of Prime-access videos.", "Date": "March 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Would be 5 stars except....", "Author": "Don Weber", "ReviewID": "RXFMR02FA0L9V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a very nicely done product, but not quite as intuitive as the iPad.

Using the Mayday button did not provide a lot of help. The wait for help was less than 15 seconds, but the assistant did not have any ideas why I could not see a number of my cds on the Kindle at the same time I could see through my laptop that they were in the Kindle internal storage in the music folder. He suggested I download the Cloud player, put my music on the cloud, and listen from the cloud. After several attempts to download the Cloud player to my laptop using internet explorer, I eventually got it to download properly using Google Chrome. Then I discovered you can only have 250 songs on the cloud without paying the $24.99 fee to put more music on the cloud. After picking and choosing what music to send to the cloud, I then found out you can't download from the cloud to the Kindle, you have to transfer from the laptop. Useless.  The Amazon cloud player would not accept about 20% of the songs I tried to transfer due to the wrong format(I think that is the issue, anyway). That is how I then looked at the properties of the tracks on the CDs and discovered the ones that would not transfer were all mwav files (windows media) so they must somehow be incompatible with the Kindle (or protected) not sure. So it appears my music issue is not just a Kindle issue, but an Amazon issue. Anyway, I am not happy with the fact that I can't put a lot of my music on the Kindle Fire HDX. That is why I have given it 4 stars instead of 5. I have been overall happy with the Apps I have downloaded. The location of the power and volume buttons is difficult to get used to.

If you have never used a Kindle Fire, the guide will tell you how to charge, plug in to a computer, register or unregister your Kindle, purchase content, and other basics.  But you won't be able to find out how to do the new, nifty stuff.  For that, you need to contact Amazon or hit the Kindle Forum.  Which means you may not know what you're missing because there isn't anything in the user guide to tell you what your Kindle can do. I've already had to contact Amazon twice to find out how to do things I could do on the HD 8.9.  It's just different enough on the HDX that I needed info.  An adequate user guide would have been useful. Perhaps Amazon will make one available in the near future (I hope).Don't let this deter you from getting the HDX 8.9.  It's a great tablet. And Amazon has the BEST customer service I have ever used, so the answer to my questions were just a quick phone call away. I just wish I had the choice to use the user guide instead. This is especially true when I'm in the middle of nowhere, because wifi isn't always available. 4G isn't always available. Electricity and running water aren't available.  We're that kind of weekends and vacations people.The HDX 8.9 comes with a 9W AC adapter and cord to charge your Kindle.  These adapters are $20 if purchased separately, and charge Kindle Fire models, as well as phones and similar items, in half the time of standard adapters. The HDX 8.9 takes great pictures (haven't used the video function yet), and is so light, you actually feel the difference compared to the HD 8.9.  Because it's different from the HD, I'm still getting used to some differences in using features, but after a week, I haven't found anything missing from the HDX 8.9 that the HD 8.9 had, and there are lots of new goodies.

But, I was not able to download some common Android apps and was not able to watch my internet TV, which I used watch on my TV, computer, or  even on my Android phone. It requires Microsoft Silverlight which cannot be downloaded on this device at all. After this I realized that I did not need 64 GB since Amazon limited number of videos to download to 25 even if it is YouTube short videos. Size of your storage does not mean anything. From the other site you can store things on Amazon Cloud, but you cannot use it if there is no internet. After several days I took one picture and my kindle died, became unresponsive and all CPR their tech support tried to do did not help. After new device was shipped out to me I used Amazon charger and it came back to live, but did not hold charge. When I received a new device I charged both of them to 100%, unplugged it and overnight the new Kindle still 100%, but the first one was fully discharged.

Works great, no complaints. Will keep it for reading books. Wanted a larger tablet mainly for watching movies/tv shows and just got the HDX8.9 (1/13/14) which is great except for the following issues which seems to be a prevalent concern from most everyone who has purchased this product.1. SOUND: very weak when watching videos. I have the device volume at max and the video volume at max and still had a hard time hearing the movie. I even tried ear plugs to drown out any ambient room noise and that didn't work either. Bass is really low too. I ckecked the HDX along side my KF1stGen and the KF1 sound was far better. Note: Some owners had luck installing a volume control app that includes an equalizer. Will try that next.2. NO HMDI PORT: to attach a cable to your TV to view movies/tv shows directly on your TV without having a set top box. This feature was on the KFHD, but they took it away in lieu of adding the \"mirroring function\" of Miracast. THIS WAS A VERY BAD IDEA, AMAZON!!!3. MIRACAST: Now, if you don't have \"select Miracast-enabled accessories and TV\" (specific Samsung Smart TV with Miracast, PS3-4, or a miracast dongle that you have to pay extra $$ for and stick it in the back of your TV) then you are out of luck in trying to mirror to your TV!  Since Miracast is the \"new\" thing it's just not available on TV's yet and you have spend more money to use this function...which if you don't want to spend the money....mirroring is basically useless. Going back to #2, Amazon should have kept the HMDI port on the HDX as a back up!4. SECOND SCREEN: Well, you can't use this either unless you get \"select Miracast-enabled accessories and TVs\".5. IN LIEU OF MIRACAST AND SECOND SCREEN: I've got ROKU so I tried using Plex, Twonky and USBtv to stream TV shows from KFHDX to my TV through ROKU and nothing worked. I'm not talking \"live\" shows. Just shows that are 2-3 episodes old. Kept getting an error on my Kindle saying \"could not play in mobile view\" when I was in desktop view. Very frustrating.6. MIRROR & SOUND APP/Update: It would be nice if Amazon would do a program update or make an app that allows set top boxes (ROKU, PS3-4, Blueray) to recognize the Miracast function so we could view KFHDX media content on TV and get better sound quality.FYI: KF-HDX has never had an update as of Nov 14, 2013 which is the \"build date\" on my device.

As an absolute minimum, a comprehensive electronic manual should have been loaded on the Fire HDX prior to delivery to the customer.Pre-delivery Amazon advertising indicated that a capability to print from the Kindle Fire HDX would be available in November.  It is now December and the capability to print material from the Fire HDX is not apparent.  Might be there, but I cannot find it.  Pre-delivery advertising made no mention of having to purchase - at additional cost - an app to get the printing capability.  The advertising made the printing capability sound like something included in a software update.I have become used to the weight of my Kindle ebook reader.

The tablet's performance is stellar, I have yet to trip it up with any game or application. Opening applications and switching between them is not just fast, it's nearly instantaneous. The screen is amazing and puts Apple's retina display to shame. Physically the tablet is comfortable to hold, pleasing to the touch, and extremely lightweight, making it very easy to tote around the house for a myriad of uses. The speakers are top notch with crystal clear audio. The optional origami case is very useful for table-top use of the tablet, holding it at a comfortable viewing angle and standing up to repeated pokes and swipes.The OS is very content-centric and responsive with the only major downside being the lack of Google Play store access. I'm a gamer and a lot of new generation games have companion apps that are just not available in the Amazon store. A workaround is to download the .APK and .OBB files of the application and upload them through USB via a PC, but that's a bit more of a pain than it needs to be to get this kind of functionality.Overall it's a great tablet, but the lack of Google Play access is slightly heartbreaking. You can search for your desired apps in the Amazon App store and it will auto-complete your searches like it has your app, only to discover that it's not available through the AA store.

I had an Android phone before, so I already had a good understanding of the OS. That being said, here are some things that could be improved. The OS is not as fluid or as intuitive as Apple. Not a surprise here. And the battery life is NOT as advertised. The iPad can last up to three days with light to moderate use. The Kindle will run all the way down the night before, charge all night, and before 9 AM, the battery will be depleted 10%. So, I strongly dispute that claim about battery life.

The HDX is a very attractive device, it feels good in your hand and the rubbery material looks great. It's also extremely light, The screen has an incredible resolution and looks outstanding when browsing and playing around. The sound is also excellent as well. There were a few things however I wasn't too impressed with. The Silk browser is meh at times, the app store is lacking, the buttons are located in weird spots, and the OS is just too integrated with Amazon. The OS isn't hard to get used to and the set up is easy but after about 3 days of use the novelty kind of wore off for me. It's an excellent device but I don't see the real need for it. It doesn't feel like the tablet would be able to do anything else but browse the web, read books, and watch movies. For a device that is close to $400 that isn't enough. I would rather spent the extra money on the Surface 2 which at least gets you Microsoft Office. I'm giving it four stars because I feel the device has a great build, great screen, is light, and does what its suppose to do very well.

It's ok.  I also own an ipad and I'm trying not to compare the two but it is hard not to.  I agree with other reviewers that the amazon AppStore is lacking.  The kindle will play amazon movies without a hitch including prime if you are a member. I've needed mayday 3 times.  Twice for problems with downloading apps and once because of a problem with the camera.  The answer every time is reset the device.  Every time! Which doesn't work by the way.  One major annoyance is that when using the rear camera while in a magnetic case there is an animation that blocks your view.  It tells you to slide up your device.  The kindle basically doesn't want to be in a magnetic case while taking a pictured. However, since the magnetic case doesn't interfere with taking a picture it is just annoying while I blocks your view.  I hope that it will be removed in a future update.  At the very least, there should be a setting option that allows you to remove the reminder alert from the middle of the screen.  Other than that, the kindle is fine.  You just need to be conscious of the (limited) market you are buying into.", "Date": "November 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" is a beautiful tablet", "Author": "M.

Initially I loved the many of the great features of the new Kindle HDX. Other reviews detail them quite well so I wont. I will add that, as a photographer, I found a great little wireless device on Amamzon to upload my picture from my sd cards (or a usb drive) on to the outstanding screen very conveniently. Here is a link to the EZOpower device..it's great with the Kindle once you sideload the app for it.B00EP13JBCNot cheap but a super work around .What I didnt know is that the rear facing camera appears to only work correctly with the Origami cases. I dislike that they need a table like surface to keep the kindle in a stable upright position so I bought a case from FInite. What I discovered (after 3 hours of very nice tech support from various folks at Amazon) is that the case causes the Kindle to think it is not ready to take a picture and therefore it stays in the instruction mode waiting for you to slide the tablet out as you would with the Origami cases. The ONLY way to get it to work it to remove the case entirely. It basically means you care forced to use the Origami case if you want full functionality with your Kindle. I got a response from Finite saying that they were aware of the problem and that all 3rd party cases have this issue to to an update done to the HDX line by Amazon in November after the cases were produced. Amazon folks were nice but said they can only verify the Oragami cases as being fully compatible with the new Kindle line. So I am very sad butgoing to return this snappy piece of technology. As a consumer I dont like having to be forced into a corner and limited by my equipment but at this point it seems that Amazon has created a problem I cant work around. :-(", "Date": "December 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Solid Device For Accessing Amazon Content, But Otherwise Very Limited", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3O9J6I1V5SOCK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This device has a ton of potential. The hardware is top notch and the screen is near-perfect. Some of the software features are fantastic, especially the Mayday help feature which works great and has been helpful multiple times already. The tight integration with Amazon services is a huge plus for us, since we use so many Amazon services.Unfortunately, we also use many Google services, and this device doesn't speak Google very well. Specifically, we use Google Apps for Business for almost everything online, but this Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 just doesn't allow us to use those services the same way a regular Android device would.Also, one of the things I love about Android devices is the customization, and most of that is right out the window on Fire OS. No custom launchers, no custom lock screens, no home screen widgets... and this highlights the biggest drawback for me: the Amazon App Store is just too limited. For example, I really dislike the stock Kindle Fire keyboard. It auto-corrects at the most annoying times, it doesn't learn very well, and it's generally just not very efficient. I'm used to the 3rd party SwiftKey keyboard. But that's not available for Fire OS at all. Neither is ANY 3rd party keyboard app. Most of the stuff available in the Amazon App Store is a bunch of games which are intended to separate me from my money rather than provide a useful function. Since I'm not much of a gamer, that's not useful for me. There are SOME productivity and utility apps available in the store, but very few. Nothing even close to what I can do with my Samsung Galaxy Note II.And that really sums up this device in a nutshell... there's a whole lot of things you can't do with it. About the only thing this tablet can do that an Android tablet can't do is play Amazon Videos. This device is mostly meant as an easy way to access Amazon content, not as a serious productivity tool. I was looking more for a companion device to my Galaxy Note II, but instead I ended up with something closer to an entertainment gateway.I'm still trying to decide if I want to send it back. It's not seeing much use right now. It just kinda sits on our living room table for a few days, until someone needs to use it and realizes that the battery has died. Then we plug it in to recharge it and the process starts all over again.I did try to shoehorn some Google-specific apps in there, like Gmail and Chrome. There are guides on the web that explain how to do so without voiding your warranty. But the Kindle Fire just isn't designed to handle some of the functions these apps require, and there are frequent error messages that crop up and need to be dismissed, even when you're not actively using those Google apps. It's not a very pleasant experience. We'd be better off sticking to what this device was meant for, which is consuming Amazon content.edit: it really is a gorgeous device, and that bears repeating. The screen is stunningly beautiful, the sound is clear and loud, I love every aspect of the hardware.", "Date": "November 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very disappointed - \"Upgrades\" don't measure up", "Author": "CL-10", "ReviewID": "R1K6JVS7QMAO2A", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "As a big Kindle lover, I pre-ordered my HDX as soon as they were shown on Amazon.

Of the ones I checked - about 20% are downloadable - and that stinks too!I have had minor glitch with the browser crapping out.

First to get more storage than my original Kindle Fire and second to achieve more versatility. I definitely have more storage and can put more content on it. But the promised versatility is disappointing. The only way to \"output\" content from your Kindle to a TV is through Miracast. So, if you have an older TV, it HAS to have an HDMI port and you have to have purchase an adapter, which is another $60-$90.(I bought the Netgear version.)The mirroring works pretty well if you have nice, high def media. So a high def movie I created looks great; HBO-to-go streaming, not so much. The movies I downloaded from Amazon were not \"highest\" quality, so on larger TVs, these movies get pixelated pretty fast. Consequently, when traveling and I want to hook up this device to another television to substitute for local content, I will make sure to download the highest resolution. Good thing I got maximum storage. I'll also need to plan for the longer downloads of highest quality content before traveling and will make sure I purchase the high def versions from Amazon.I also purchased the Bluetooth keyboard. The keyboard is kind of cheap feeling--lightweight plastic. That isn't necessarily bad,I like the lightness. But the size is just a bit bigger than the device so hauling it around requires some slop in a case. I have the origami case right now, and it's okay, but I'm not sure the designers of the device, case, and keyboard talked to each other to create transport efficiencies.Also, I've found that the device is sensitive and often \"quits\" from an application or a book with the slightest movement. (This might be a result of the buttons on the back of the device and their interaction with the origami case.) This also is disappointing. The screen, size, and weight are outstanding. The sound isn't all it's amped up to  be but it's still pretty good for a small device. If it weren't for the disappointing versatility, I would say this provides beautiful high-def quality and a pretty good choice. But for larger display use, this device is limited. As a mobile device for doing work, it's not bad, but still doesn't offer the versatility of a Surface, for example. In the end, the amount I spent on this device and all the accoutrements could have purchased a high-end Windows 8 or similar tablet and provided me greater flexibility.", "Date": "November 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love My New 8.9 HDX, 64GB Kindle", "Author": "Kate Fredericks \"Kate\"", "ReviewID": "R3F6UC5ZB0DKXF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my 5th Kindle and by far the best yet. I am not well versed in all things technology, I just like what I like. The very first thing I noticed when lifting it out of its box, was how light it is. I truly had no idea it was going to be lighter than all of the previous versions, but the difference is, I can actually hold this tablet comfortably with one hand while typing with the other. I could not do this for more than a minute or so with my other 4 Kindles. Plus, the sleekness of the style helps, too. It is not boxy like the other versions, but curves under which surprisingly gives my holding hand a much better grip.The clarity of picture was the second thing I noticed when I fired up my knew super-duper Kindle. Everything was so sharp, it almost hurt my eyes! The third thing I noticed was the speed. Compared to my last 8.9 HD, this thing flies! The fourth thing I noticed is FINALLY a new and far better key board. I type about 80 WPM on my laptop. I know I don't type that fast on these built in keyboards, but this is the first time I have felt like I am typing on a solid, well-built tablet keyboard. It has kept up with everything I type (something the old 8.9 HD never did), and has a far better auto correct function. The auto correct function is also much faster learning words it doesn't recognize, something that drove me crazy on the old 8.9 HD.As for the battery, I am in the process of testing it now. I gave it a full charge yesterday and took it off around 5:00 p.m. I did some Twitter and Facebook, accidentally found the camera which I immediately took several pictures and movies in very low light. I have a black Lab and a black cat. In low light I literally can't get a decent picture of either of them and if I use flash, all I get are eyes (in low light). This thing took amazing pictures AND movies of both of my animals which when played back were the clearest I have been able to get them.As for the Mayday button, having owned so many Kindles, I chuckled when I read it was a feature. But when I could NOT figure out how to move some important apps from my 8.9 HD to this new HDX, I decided to give it a try. Within a minute, I was talking to a very nice young lady, who took control of my Kindle, showed me how to move what could be moved and along with me learning that my favorite weather app was not yet compatible with this one. RATS! So, I suppose you all who know electronics well might not need that button, but THANK YOU AMAZON, for the likes of me who need a helping hand now and again.I actually brought home and tried the new Windows 8 tablet and it SERIOUSLY could not even remotely compare with the old 8.9 HD let alone my new HDX which is way way better than that Surface (in my opinion). Not going to go into details here, let's just say I already know the Kindle, and after using this new HDX, I am staying with the Kindle. To get back to the battery. I have been on and off all day, and am finishing this review with 75% of the battery left! That is jaw dropping for me. I had to stay plugged into my old Kindles because I was lucky to get 3 hours doing the same thing. It has now been 27 hours and this Kindle has only used 25% of its battery?I wholeheartedly recommend this 8.9 HDX, 64 GB Kindle.

As a Wifi only device it was necessary to wait almost 8 hours to download only a 28 minute episode of Alpha House of any quality at a local coffee shop.I have joined the many people disconnecting from the high priced Internet Providers. A true Wifi device needs to offer a means of downloading or streaming away from your home.The download speed was limited to 3 kbps which is typical of limited public Wifi sites. Streaming was impossible on the Kindle while my Lenovo Twist had no trouble at all streaming Netflix. Also, after purchasing hundreds of paperback and hardbound books only 6 books were available from the Matchbook Kindle special pricing(2.99, 1.99, 99) on books I already own. So sad. So the majority of any books I already own would need to be repurchased at a substantial cost to me and I found a ridiculously poor way to market the device that cost me $369.00 with tax. For the money I found the latest Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 to be a waste of money to be an expensive e-reader in today's technology revolution and with new products being released everyday.A good product needs to have added value to justify the cost of converting from hard texts to Kindle/e-books.It could not come close to competing with streaming I have on my 3 year old DroidX or my 1 year old Lenovo Twist.

It is slow, it is heavy and it is weird.And my hate for the iPad 2 got worse when I got the 8.9\" HDX for my wife because while the screen was smaller, the device practically weights nothing. And the screen is amazing. So I got myself one too.I actually like this thing so much that many times I read with it instead of using my PaperWhite. The PaperWhite is now used mostly when I am out of the house. If I am at home I rotate between the 8.9\" HDX and the PaperWhite. It is light enough that I can read or watch movies in bed, something I can't do with the iPad 2.Cons: Very hard to locate the back buttons by feel. In the 7\" HD I was used to run my finger along the edge (this is in the dark) until I felt the headphone jack, but now I have to feel for the speaker grille, which tells me if I am holding the device right.  Yes, I could turn on the lights, but the idea is to turn on the device without waking up my wife.Durability: it is too early to tell, but mine has already survived a nasty fall that would had murdered my iPad 2. I had the 8.9\" HDX on the holding tray on a treadmill, I knocked it over, it landed on the treadmill track, BANG, it bounced, landed on the hardwood floor, BANG. Not a scratch.Screen: fantastic. Photos look like glossy prints. Video looks incredible, no slowdowns at all. Reading is much more pleasant than on a 7\" Kindle Fire (for reading purposes you can't compare the original Fire to any of the e-ink Kindles), and nicer than the 7\" Kindle Fire HD (not by much, but it is better). I never play games but my wife seems to spend hours playing games on hers, never a complaint except mine whenever I see a new order for Amazon coins.Chassis: really nice, I like what Amazon did except that they could have added some kind of marking one could use to locate the buttons by touch. The buttons are better placed than on the HD 7\". And it weights nothing, it is amazing how light it feels.Software: Not a problem unless you depend on Google-branded apps. If you aren't joined to Google at the hip, then you won't feel much of a difference between this and a pure Android device. You can side load without jail breaking, or you can jail break the device and risk warranty issues later, but that's up to you. I believe that for most people this is very handy, especially if you are a Prime subscriber.Sound: I prefer headphones, but my wife uses hers with the built-in speakers exclusively, and they sound very nice.Value: Even tacking a 2-year square trade warranty+insurance policy, and even taking into account that you won't get Google-branded applications, this is a fantastic deal. I expect to pick up a third one as soon as my son's 7\" HD runs out of its warranty extension.", "Date": "March 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "love it.", "Author": "Sherion Beck", "ReviewID": "R1I823J58KD4JS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Best money I ever spent..

Well, I setup 3 of these for my wife and kids and while I found this tablet lacking on the technical/features side (I prefer Windows 8 tablets for that matter,) my wife and kids loved it, ironically, for these same reasons. Since it is a locked-down, and watered-down version of Android, it is not overly overwhelming in features, making it easier to use for kids and non-technical people. So this tablet fills this niche perfectly. And the 4G LTE option makes it a great portable tablet on the go (travel/beach/school/etc.)To nitpick, I'm surprised Amazon didn't add wireless-ac and Bluetooth mouse support in this hardware refresh, To nitpick even more, a 13MP or even 20MP rear camera would have been more attractive than 8MP for this price range. I also found its charger, though very cute and small, is also very slow, specially if the Kindle is charging in sleep mode and not in shutdown mode. For that slow charging, maybe Amazon should have added wireless charging as an added feature to cancel out this shortcoming (it will still be slow to charge, but at least it will be a convenient wireless charging :-) ) But this is all nitpicking;  this a 5-star product!If I were to pick the one thing this tablet shines most at, it is, not surprisingly, on the (Kindle) e-reader side.

As it is it's pretty darn close.", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Tablet and Huge Improvement over Kindle Fire HD 8.9", "Author": "Kindle Customer", "ReviewID": "R2L8IQPDL7TV2I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good Points!This thing is fast!  I had an original Kindle Fire 7 inch and a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and both felt fairly sluggish compared to other tablets.  I remember reading about how revolutionary the Silk browser would be but in practical use it was much slower than other browsers.  The extra speed gained by caching certain websites was lost when the processor couldn't handle loading pages.  Not any more! With the new processor every thing on this thing flies.  going into to apps, and books and trying processor heavy actions couldn't hold it back, every thing felt really fast and I wasn't constantly waiting for things to load like I had with the previous versions of kindle fire.  It really is a noticeable difference and a huge improvement.The fire OS 3.0 is really great.  while things look similar its a fresh coat of paint that was desperately needed.  the all ways there carousel is a lot better than the favorites tray of days past.  It really does make a big difference having all the apps immediately available instead of digging through menus.Video and the screen are super clear.  HD video looks amazing and every thing on the carousel is crisp and clear.  While this is a big upside there is a small downside in that i can see pixilation in some of my comic book novels I bought on kindle.  They apparently weren't created with HD in mind and now its distracting to see pixilation when every thing else on screen is so clear.  Comixology has upgraded their app for HD comics so its not an issue their.  My comixology books look incredible.  Hopefully this is temporary and the resolution of said books will be updated (I won't hold my breath though).x-ray features are really cool.  The movie and book x-ray features are back and even better.  you can make flashcards in books, you can see every time a character or place is mentioned and simply navigate books better than ever.  I was never a fan of having to hyperlink to the table of contents then hyperlink from there to the chapter you want and hope its the right now.  Now the chapters appear within the control menu of the book so you can go directly to another chapter while not switching pages.  You can highlight in more than one color now.  The notes and other extras are all a lot better integrated and slicker than ever.  There is also goodreads integration so you can read your friends reviews, write reviews from in the book, and see general good reads reviews as well all within the book.  The music x-ray is cool, you can now karaoke along with lyrics of songs you own.  It feels gimmicky but its nice to have and once there is better mirrorcast functionality its cool you can have impromptu karaoke sessions.  The movies x-ray is improved too.  Now you can go directly to famous quotes and trivia scenes via hyperlink.  Trivia from IMDB now shows up along with the actors/actresses that are on screen.  All and all lots of good improvements here.Mayday is all right.  I did it as a test run when I got it and while its nice its there I doubt i'll ever need it again.  It is nice that I could recommend a kindle fire to older non-tech savvy relatives and they have an easy tech support outlet that isn't me.Not so GoodApps, apps, apps.  Same complaint with every model in that you don't get the complete android app store.  While they are getting better at getting bigger apps there are still a slew of what I would consider top priority apps I can't get.  There is the entire google suite which we will pretty much never get our hands on but also apps like marvel comics unlimited, weight watchers, uverse, darkhorse comics, dropbox, etc. which have an android app but not in the amazon store.  I have been sideloading them on with varying degrees of success but it is frustrating to know the app exists but you are locked out of it.  This alone is the biggest downside of the kindle fire experience.  If I had access to all these apps it'd be a 5 out of 5 with just beaming radiance of amazon love.Long term upgrades.  With this being the third generation its clear that after a year you aren't going to get upgrades or support for your kindle.  I can understand when you upgrade the processor like you do for this iteration that putting fire os 3.0 might now be possible on the kindle fire HD 8.9 but there are a lot of things they could have upgraded they didn't.  The kindle reading app on the kindle fire hd 8.9 is inferior to the reading app on the ipad.  This just shouldn't be the case.  when you add features like multicolor highlighting and x-ray it should be across the line of devices.  While I love my kindle now there is real fear that in a year it will be missing cool new features and I know I will never get them.  It makes the iPad a lot better looking device when you know you'll have at least two and maybe more years of support to follow.Lack of Chromecast/screen share.  Maybe this will get better down the line but with out a hdmi output the solution of being able to mirrorcast your screen has a utter lack of support.  There are a couple of dongles you can by to use this feature and apparently future Samsung TV's will support it but as of now that's it.  The Fire Netflix app supports chromecast but the HBOGO app doesn't.  Amazon needs to get release its own screencast device and support chromecast fully to give people options.Battery life seems better all though it does drain a lot of battery while in stand by.  With my ipad if in stand by it'll last like a week, with my kindle fire a good 20-30% battery is lost if I leave it on and asleep all day.  usage battery life is up which is nice but like I said its a pain when I pick it up at the end of the day and find the battery is dead or close to dead.", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great little tablet", "Author": "Kindle Customer", "ReviewID": "RNYJXWPI5214T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Will not be buying that new laptop, this tablet does everything I need.

The IPad was okay, and it did the job, but it had its issues; kind of iffy WiFi reception (even in my house), problems playing certain types of videos that required flash player, etc.  I did a fair amount of research, for a layperson, read lots of reviews, and decided to purchase this tablet instead of going for a laptop.  My main reason for doing so was portability; so much easier transporting a tablet.  I really needed something to access work sites from home, do professional reading, casual reading, watch a movie here and there, play a game.The first thing that I noticed was that the graphics were amazing. Crisp, clear pictures; clean lines, really gorgeous.  WiFi reception was much improved within my house, pages loaded faster than the IPad, so far so good.  Then I began running into some snags.  Amazon doesn't have the app we use for our company email (First Class), which was available on the IPad.  I am able to enter using a browser, but the site does not function as well.  I tried to access another company website and was met with \"Error 500\" codes when trying to login; again, not a problem I had on the IPad.  This one hurt, because I actually had to get in to do some work, so I had to kick my 15 year old off of his desktop to get into our company website (that was enjoyable for both of us).I did play one puzzle game and it was great-no hangups or lags; same with watching a movie.  I wish I could say that everything went well in this area, but I also ran into some snags.  Some games aren't available for the HDX, only the non-HDX versions of the Kindle, but are advertised by Amazon as \"Available for Kindle\".  It gets frustrating when you think you've found something, only to find its a non-compatible version.  If you go looking for games on popular sites like Big Fish or Google Play, you notice how far behind in the market Android is compared to IPad (I was schooled by a 7-year old in a rather know-it-all tone).So, is the Kindle the end-all-be-all?

I can surf the internet or read continuously all day without having to recharge it other than at night.The picture seems really good, but I am not picky with that sort of thing.E-book prices range from amazingly good to outrageously overpriced. Staying diligent, I am confident one could find a dozen books to read a month for less than $30.Overall, it's one of the best purchases I've ever made.

I believe that Amazon prime only is available on Ipads, computers, streaming boxes, smart TV's but definitely not on Android phones and tablets. The ipad, iPhone, and other I devices are not on my desired list.Amazon doesn't allow many Google apps to be installed such as maps, chrome, gmail (app) that work much better than the substitutes that are at their app store.  The browser app Silk they provide is really terrible.  When you use it to visit the Google search site, it really bogs down to almost not working.  If you use the Netflix app, it hardly works, just spins its wheels.What is disappointing about the Fire HDX is that I had expected the device to improve with time but it hasn't. It's on an island by itself with little reason to listen to its critics.  Though it is an Android device it doesn't take advantage of the large collection of great apps at the Android Play Store.

Again, I thought the HD 9\" Kindle would be all I needed and loved it, but then the HDX came out and had even more capabilities that I could use.  One of the most important reasons why I bought the HDX is because it is thinner and weighs less than the Kindle HD.  The picture/screen is more resilient and the other driving reason I bought it is because of the camera - not just a front facing one (which is an app on the HD camera) but is a real camera with zoom and video and other capabilities.  The one main issue that is somewhat of a negative however is that nowhere does it tell you that if you want to watch a movie by connecting to the TV, you have to purchase an additional 'unit' (I spent $60 for it).

Bought the HDX because I wanted an IPAD style camera among other things. I got the HDX a week ago and it has blown me away. First of all, the weight is so light and also the battery is great. I played a video with the brightness all the way up and I got like ten hours with the WIFI off(the WIFI drains a lot of battery by the way so keep it off if your not on the web). The screen resolution is like BLURAY quality but also a great tip is that if you're watching an SD video, put it at least five feet from you and the brightness all the way up and it's very close to HD quality. It's very smooth and fast when scrolling around the screen. Love that they finally included a rapid charger. Nothing bad to say but are a couple of things they could improve on but are really minor.

The apps are usually minimal in expense and books come with audibe capacity. One major selling  point was the size of the screen. The phones were just too small and I personally had no need for mobile phones.  Land lines suited us well without the extra expense and we had a satellite dish for our PC. I also did not want to go through changing phone numbers. When we do need a mobile phone, the Trac phones were good enough.It is not that I had not wanted something more usable.

I always enjoyed it, with the exception of the poor workmanship of the charging port. Amazon made that right by giving me a Fire HD (the first gen of the HD with the camera) for a minor cost upgrade even though my Fire was 2 years old.  I appreciated that and then bought this.  This really does a great job of tying it all together.  The only complaint I have about the Fire platform is that it's a little too \"Apple\" for me.  What I mean by that is that because Amazon earns so much off their content, they purposely limit what they feel is competition.  I can't use Chrome as a browser and I can't download dropbox. (on their native settings... I've not attempted to d/l apps from other sources yet), but that's all on the \"App\" side. The actual tablet is a nice tablet (a great size) and has most of the bells and whistles i need. I wish it had GPS for the basic WiFi version (My Nexus 7 does) but where they go wrong there, they have a flash for the camera. (my Nexus 7 doesn't have flash).So in summary, great tablet, just hope that Amazon realizes that they are better supporting the free market and the best product than attempting to force you to use all of their versions of apps.", "Date": "April 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Just love my HDX Fire", "Author": "Judy Filipski-Baum \"judygwtw\"", "ReviewID": "R17K3QK2JSJLJ1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "One of the best purchases I've made in a long time.

It wasn't hard to figure out, even though I'm not very tech savvy. Whenever I got stuck, I called the Help line and with one exception, everyone was very knowledgeable and walked me through my questions/problems.  The battery life is great! I use it to read daily and when it gets down to 60-70%, I charge it for a while.  Doesn't take long to get back to 100%.  The issues/downside:  There was (is?) a packaging snafu and the adapter cord did not fit the adapter properly, therefore, the Kindle wouldn't charge. I had gotten an extra 9W adapter and after problem solving this with the Help line, I was sent what I needed at no charge, in very little time. After resolving that problem, recharging is much faster than my laptop.  My other disappointments were 1) it's not compatible with the program that allows me to play some of my online games, although I've been told that addition is being negotiated; and 2) I live in the Florida Keys, too far from the mainland for greater access to E books, so aside from purchasing the books I want to read, what's available to me for free is very limited. This is probably not an issue for people on the mainland. I have, however, been able to buy the books I wanted from Amazon ($9.99).  I haven't traveled with it yet so I don't know how it functions with videos, but all in all, I'm glad I bought it.

I am replacing an first generation iPad. The Kindle Fire is an improvement in terms of image and speed, as numerous people have pointed out already. I have had a couple of issues however. First, I have some difficulty retaining a quality wi-fi connection. This is escpecially problematic as I use it a lot to watch Netflix and Amazon Prime videos. This is annoying and likely due to my router, althgough this is a problem I didn't experience in the same way with the iPad. Second, and this is VERY minor, based on the wealth of information on Amazon, I was expecting the highly-touted Origami cover. If you read the fine print in the product specs, you plainly see that no cover is included. Again, not a big deal, but it seemed as though the cover was provided. I was able to get another one fairly quickly so problem solved.

However, most apps were available through the Amazon App store.  Other things, like Google Maps, was available in it's full version using the Silk browser, which is really fast as well.  And if you really need an app you can't find in the Amazon App store, there are simple ways to get your apps from Google without needing to root your device.  Just search online...it's really easy.The only thing this tablet is missing that I can find is the lack of a GPS.  But for $170 less than an iPad, and for a faster processor and better display than almost any other tablet on the market, I can live without a GPS.

When tying it onto the Prime membership, it makes it a winning combination. There are a few reasons why I can't give 5 stars to this Kindle:1. No Google integration - Yes, I know what everyone else will say. If you really want that you should've bought either Google hardware or go with Samsung, etc. Sure, you're right. But no, that doesn't mean Google integration should not be part of the package. What happened if Google decided not to support any Amazon app (and just removed them all from Play store)? I wish Amazon would just allow Google apps in and let the market decide who they want to go with. Again, this hardware is just plain beautiful.2. Problem with speakers - Within the first few weeks I had a problem with speakers where they just stopped working.After reaching out to Mayday (awesome service, Amazon!) the service person suggested that I would insert/remove headphone jack and see if that would fix the issue. It did immediately. The person went on to say that it was a known issue and product development was working on it. I just wish there was some communication/fix on the issue already.Overall this is a great device. I am still enjoying it very much and look forward to updates to the ecosystem.

Connecting to my WiFi was simple and without problems.  Adding the device to my existing Verizon account did require my calling Verizon's tech support, but that's probably because I live out from town and wasn't getting a strong enough signal.  However, Verizon tech support was very helpful and quickly resolved the problem.  There was also a glitch connecting to my email account on my ISP, but that seems to have been a problem at their end, and has been resolved.  Connecting to my Gmail account was seamless.I've found the frequent complaint of not enough apps (compared to as standard Android) to be a non issue for me.  I've had no problem finding the apps I need and want, or acceptable replacements in cases where the ones I'm use to aren't available.It would be nice if the HDX came with Google maps/navigator installed, but I have that on my phone, so it's not a big issue.  Besides Map Quest maps/navigation is free at the Kindle app store.  It may not be quite up to Google maps, but then again, maybe it is.  I really haven't an opportunity to try it yet.All in all, I'm pleased with my device, and I'm giving it 4 stars only because I've only had it for one day.=======================  Comments added on 2/27/2014 ==================================================I'm now two weeks into owning my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 (Verizon), and I've added another star to my rating to make it a 5-star rating.  I stand by all my comments above, and would like to add that I find the management and use of my Kindle library so much easier with this tablet than with my old (Gen. 3, I think) Kindle.  With this device I get to see the cover of the book I'm reading each time I open it on the carrousel, so I can remember the name of the book I'm reading.  On my old Kindle, I usually only saw the title and author when I first started reading and quickly forgot both (hey, I'm 70 years old).I've installed Waze navigation app, and it works very well - not that I will use my tablet often for navigation, but it's nice to have.Like most, if not all, Android based tablets, it doesn't get as strong a 4G or 3G signal as my Android phone, but I'm usually connected to WiFi, so that's not particularly important to me, which I'm sure begs the question of why did I buy a 4G model to begin with.  The answer is simple - I wanted to.All in all I find the Kindle Fire HDX far superior to my wife's Android tablet, and I'm very pleased with it.

I went to the FireHDX 8.9  for the bigger screen and do not regret it. I have found it just as easy to use and love the larger screen without adding any weight. My only complaint is so far, I have not found a way to delete a page of email messages at one time. This I could do on my fire.It is a great tablet for my uses and would recommend it to anyone who likes to read.", "Date": "January 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Can't live without my Kindle.", "Author": "Leslie Becker", "ReviewID": "RDYKWLA6OY3H4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my 3rd Kindle and I absolutely love it. I had a Fire HD 8.9 and was very happy with it but I was excited about the changes they made with the HDX so I just had to have one. The graphics are amazing and I am very happy with the placement of the power and volume buttons. Also, because of the slimmer profile and the lighter weight it is much nicer to hold. I'm already looking forward to the next model upgrade. Thank you Amazon!", "Date": "January 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "I take it everywhere!", "Author": "M.

And some videos won't play on it.

The colors are brilliant.  I keep expecting something I'm watching to jump out into my lap!  Love the apps.  Battery charge is very good, but of course, games eat up the battery pretty quickly.  I was able to load my e-mail, facebook, twitter, etc. very easily.  Books are wonderful to read and I love the highlight function.  I like the size of it and the weight.  I bought a beautiful Belkin cover that fits it perfectly.  I bought the cover in the Kindle store.  The speed is incredible. It is instantly on and ready to go.  The camera takes excellent pictures, although it's a bit bulky to actually take the pictures.  I'm used to a much smaller phone with camera.", "Date": "January 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Device", "Author": "Timothy D Parker", "ReviewID": "R3EDLKLNA6J6QK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great device great hardware software is restrictive for customization....home screen you can't change the background, permanently change the carousel or turn it off. I don't mind the special offers but they don't open the device to it's fullest. If you have a decent idea what you want to do in a tablet and know how to use it don't get this one. If you want a tablet that just works \"Mac style\" with out the cost get this one. If you have enough devices to do what you want with any how (like myself) this is a great addition to the arsenal.", "Date": "January 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "love kindle", "Author": "roberta laughlin", "ReviewID": "R2H94XIKE9NWGR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love the kindle. it does more then I realize. my reading experience has been wonderful.

I'm a bit of an enthusiast and I'm an IT guy, so people come to me for advise. I've had one in each generation for a while now.I can finally say that the superior Kindle has arrived. This is the first Kindle Fire that has a screen truly better than anything else in the mainstream market. It is clear, bright, infinitely crisp and perfectly meant for reading. Reading on this may actually be better than a real book. I've liked other Kindles and iPads, but for the pure reading enthusiast this is a fantastic device.Thin, light, fast. Fast charging. Feels good in the hands. I have no hesitation to recommend this, though I did give it 4 stars instead of 5.I still want to challenge Amazon to keep innovating on their \"home screen\". I feel like they can do more, and do better. It's a small thing, but I think it really says a lot about the device to the user, and I feel like the current home screen, which hasn't changed much since Kindle Fires came to be, undersells the power of the device, but doesn't better sell any single function.That all being said, I have never been more strongly in support of the Kindle Fire line, especially for those who love Amazon and are huge readers.", "Date": "January 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "happy,happy,", "Author": "J.
