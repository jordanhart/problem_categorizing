Oddly enough, it's so beautifully easy to use (my one year old daughter loves playing with it), it's almost doesn't feel like a computer at all.A word of warning - this review is written for people who've never owned an iPad before - and are wondering what all the fuss is about.  If you're thinking of upgrading skip down to the \"What's great about the Air\" section below, or just buy it - it's amazing.Just what's all the fuss about?--------------------------------------I used to own a laptop for work, and (very occasionally), it'd sit on my lap on the sofa, and I'd use it for pleasure (eMail, watching films or playing the odd game).  Then I bought my first iPad, and the laptop became redundant, a boring \"work device\".  Hard to explain, but the fact the iPad is so small and light, and you navigate around with your finger by pointing and gently swiping the screen makes the whole experience a lot easier - a lot more fun.Even my most \"Luddite\" of friends have been won over.It's incredibly simple and easy to use (it only has one main button), and everyone from my one year old daughter to my 85 year old dad have taken to without problems.  It's size and shape also support using it like a book (literally to read a book or web page), but you can also watch TV and films.Personally I'm also paranoid about my password getting \"hacked\", and someone running up a huge Amazon bill or buying stuff with my credit card on eBay.  Well one of the benefits of the iPad (and iPhone) is it's \"almost impossible\" to get a virus - one of the most common ways to get hacked.  This doesn't mean you shouldn't use strong passwords, (both Sony and Adobe got hacked), but it's reassuring to leave the Windows world behind.Finally, I love the way these devices (iPad, iPhone, Apple TV, Apple Mac), increasingly work together.  The fact you can start a Pages document on your Mac and edit it on your iPad, or take photos on the iPhone, and in seconds see them on the iPad or Mac and display them on the Apple TV.The thing is, \"it just works\".What would you use if for?----------------------------------* Shopping online.  Obviously - you could be reading a review on Amazon about the iPad Air!* Reading News stories.  As you can hold it like a book it's great to read the news online (my wife loves the UK Daily Mail newspaper Online - personally I prefer a web digest from free app Zite).* Reading Books.  It's great for reading books from Amazon Kindle or Apple Books with the benefit of 1,000s of online book reviews* Navigating web pages.  Instead of clicking with a mouse, you gently swipe your fingers on screen to scroll around* Watching Films.  I use it to watch Netflix online videos (with an Apple TV you can send stuff to the telly)* Reading and replying to mail.  I use \"mailbox\" a great free app to read and reply to mails, but there's a free one included* Showing and organising photos.  Any photos on an iPhone are automatically available within minutes in \"the cloud\"* Playing games.  From fun puzzle games like \"Cut the Rope\" to fully fledged first person shooters.* Listening to the Radio.  With \"Tune in Radio\" you can listen to thousands of radio stations world-wide.  My personal favourite is London UK based XFM - alternative rock* Listening to music.  I stream mine to an Apple TV, but you can also buy portable speakers or just plug into the AUX socket* The list goes on and on.Which model should I buy?----------------------------------I can't comment about Android tablets (apart from the Google Nexus which is well regarded), but in terms of the Apple tablet line-up in order of cost:-1. Avoid the Apple iPad 2, it's a relatively old model, under-powered and with a lower resolution screen.  If you really want an Apple but don't want to spend the cash, buy a 16g WIFI 3rd or 4th generation iPad from eBay.  Avoid this one.2. iPad mini is a lovely tablet.  A 7.9 inch screen and astonishingly light and remarkably thin - it feels like a light-weight book.3. iPad mini with retina screen. Again 7.9 inch screen, but with the blazingly fast A7 chip and a \"retina\" (high definition) screen.  Worth the upgrade if you can afford it.4. iPad Air.  Much larger screen size (9.7 inches - doesn't sound much but it makes a huge difference).  Same fast (A7) chip as the Mini with Retina - the latest and fastest iPad available.Clearly (from my viewpoint) there's only really three options.  The iPad Mini, the Mini with retina screen and Air.What are the Optional add-ons?-----------------------------------------Well, assuming you've dropped by the Apple Store (which I would highly recommend - fantastic service), and handled the iPad Mini (with/without retina screen), and iPad Air then your options are around memory size and cellular option.Memory:  Once bought, you can't add memory (space for apps, films, books etc).  However, the basic price goes up a huge amount (+$100 for the 16g to 32g iPad Air).  But, having owned a 16g and then a 32g iPad - I can safely recommend the 16g unless you really want to store a huge amount of videos and downloads.  Only you can decide, and if you're lucky enough that money is no object then splash out.  Otherwise, 16g should be fine for most people.Celular:  Allows you to connect to the internet while you're out and about.  This will add an additional +$100 to the price and means you can slip in a mobile phone SIM card.  This means (for an additional $5-10 a month extra), you can access the internet on the move.  Alternatively, you can opt for the WIFI option, and use it at home or at at \"hot spot\" (eg. Starbucks, most rail stations and hotels etc).Personally I'd buy (and indeed did), the 16Gb iPad Air WIFI.Do I need anything else?-------------------------------Most people (me included) buy a cover.  Apple (and now several copy-cats) make a \"smart-cover\" which automatically shuts down the iPad when you close it, and switches it on when you open it.  There's versions which cover the back, or just the screen.  Apple charge from $35 to $65 for their (admittedly) high quality fabric or leather covers, but there's many available from $10.  Be aware, you do get what you pay for.Personally,I think it's a pity to cover the beautiful aluminium industrial design of the iPad with a cover - but if you've spent hundreds of pounds you'll want to protect it from scrapes and bangs.I also invested in a keyboard ($20-$70), as I tend to write a lot of mails and documents (remember it comes with a word processor).  I'd recommend the ogitech Ultra Thin iPad Air Case with Keyboard - Space Grey and the ZAGG Keys iPad Air Case Folio with Backlit Keyboard although these are strictly optional unless you want to use your iPad as a proper laptop.Finally, if you have another Apple device (eg. an iPhone, Apple TV or Mac) you'll find these work together beautifully.  For example, you can create a reminder on your iPad and it appears on your iPhone.  Equally, photos taken on your iPhone appear on your iPad, and you can stream music or videos from iPad, iPhone or Mac to an Apple TV.Some people think this \"locks you in\" - but it's your choice.How should I set it up?--------------------------Well, if you already own an iPad or iPhone it's incredibly easy.  Just log in with your existing iTunes and iCloud accounts, and select the option to either set this up as a new iPad or restore from backup.If you've never owned an iPad before - read on to hear about how to set up an iTunes and iCloud account - it certainly confused me the first time I used them.+ iTunes account - is how you buy your music, Apps or films from Apple.  You register your credit card with them, and protect the account with a secure password+ iCloud account - is used to identify you as an individual.  This gives you 5Gb of backup space (your iPad will be automatically backed up when you charge it), and also means your iPad will work together with your iPhone.How to set them  up:1) Create a SINGLE iTunes account for your immediate family and children.  Then when you buy an App, it's immediately available (for free) to all the family members.  Maybe once the children reach 15-16 they'll want their own account (as otherwise they'll end up spending your hard earned cash on your credit card to buy music you don't want).  Until then - it's a great way to share the Apps.2)  Create YOUR OWN INDIVIDUAL iCloud account for person.  That means if you buy an iPhone you can share data (eg. reminders, notes or calendar events) across both devices.  If you're partner (and maybe even children) have their own iCloud account they also have 5Gb of space, and can keep their own notes and documents private.Easy when you know how.What's great about the Air?-----------------------------------* Lighter (30%) and thinner than the previous version (469g from 650g)* Even faster A7 chip.  Blazingly fast!* Improved sound (compared to the iPad 4)* Software including  + iMovie - edit and publish home made movies  + Numbers - Fully functional Excel for the iPad  + Pages - Word processor  + GarageBand - Play a piano or a drum kit  + iPhoto - Edit and organise your photosWhat's not so great?--------------------------* The change in physical size means you'll need a new keyboard or replacement cover if you're upgrading* Pity Apple didn't include the \"touch ID\" to secure your passwordsOverall Opinion---------------------It's hard to believe the iPad version 1 was released just four years ago, and there's a huge raft of \"me too\" tablet computers to choose from, but the Apple iPad Air is still the one to beat.As the UK based consumer magazine \"Which?\" magazine put it - \"...the best tablet we've ever tested.  Apple packs a beautiful screen and lightning fast processor into a slimmer-than-ever shell, and battery life is very impressive\".Yes, there are cheaper Android based alternatives, but the quality, design and beauty of this tablet just sets it apart.  If it were a car it'd be a top of the range Mercedes or a BMW.Highly Recommended.", "Date": "January 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "Daniel G. Lebryk", "ReviewID": "R2RCYFJ9NNSROC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The iPad Air is everything I imagined it would be and a lot more. This latest generation iPad is so much lighter than previous versions; it is now approaching the weight of a Kindle - meaning it is easy to hold for a long time. The body is about two inches narrower, making it easier to hold. The retina display is so darn sharp and looks great.The iPad Air finally pushed me to upgrade my original, version 1 of the iPad. I bought that iPad on release day, seemingly millions of years ago. I loved that device, my one complaint was that the iPad was too heavy - everything else about it was great. Now that I've used the Air, I'll never go back. This was an upgrade well worth doing.November 2, 2013 Update: After using this for two days and thinking harder about the iPad, I figured you might want a few reasons why this might not be for you. Your iPad works just great and you don't do much more than read email, play angry birds, and look at websites all at home. In my case I went from a slow turtle first generation iPad to this lightning fast new version - I'm blown away. And if you have a latest previous version and get a great deal on recycling your current model (read at least $200) then it might make a lot of sense. This is an expensive device, and a MacBook Air is not all that far away from the iPad, after you add $60 for a case, $100 for two years of accidental breakage coverage, and maybe $60 for a keyboard. A MacBook Air at $1100 suddenly doesn't look all that expensive anymore, especially if you opt for the 128GB option of the iPad. Of course there is nothing like holding one of these new iPads and they are super sweet. If you are super logical and conservative, this is probably not the device for you.On the other hand, I decided to jump in both feet first.Setup was super fast and easy. There is a good step-by-step wizard to get the device running. Since I have an iCloud account, I was blown away with how fast this thing synced. That whole improved WiFi antenna is not hype - the device connected quickly with my network. Most devices take a while to connect to my network, this was painless and fast. Filling in the information for my mail account, it seemed like seconds and new email was downloaded - significantly faster than my other iPad.I had a choice during set up to restore from a backup or set up the unit as new. I chose new device, so none of my apps loaded right away. If I had chosen a backup, I could plug this into my computer and with iTunes could have grabbed my purchased apps. All incredibly seamless.Video is stunning. Amazon Prime Video took seconds to start (I've gotten used to 15-20 seconds). The video started in standard def, and within 15 seconds switched to high def. So much faster than happens even on my PS3. I have never seen buffering move this fast, scanning forward, there was a 5 second delay for buffering and the movie resumed. Sound is much better than the single speaker. It is still not great, just more passable. It is silly that they put two speakers on the bottom of the iPad. A speaker on top and bottom would give movies stereo. Music sounds better. Two speakers put out more sound, the stereo effect is minimal, the two speakers are one inch apart.This is an incredible display for films. The blacks are deep, rich, and have great tone range. Out of the box, this display looks fantastic.Everything moves so darn fast. Switching apps is a snap. New apps load with a blink of an eye.I'm glad I bought the full size iPad; Apple got this size and weight exactly right. I think this is well worth the extra $100 over the retina mini to be released the end of November. Apple has blurred the lines between these two devices. I guess they've done the same thing with iPods, so it makes sense they would do it with the iPad.If you've used iOS 7 on an iPhone, the iPad is essentially the same thing - you will feel right at

I own an iPad 2 and 3 and now this new iPad Air version.  My main reasons for updating were that I literally fill up my 64 GIG iPad every day or two with videos and photos that I shoot.  Having this larger version at 128 GIG allows me to work longer and add more to my iPad.  In addition this new version is much lighter and easier to use all day long.  Even though the battery is smaller in capacity than my iPad 3 the battery life is longer and it is very noticeable. This is because the faster A7 CPU and the motion chip actually use less power.Please watch my video as I go into more details in it.I immediately noticed the increase in speed.  The unit connects to the WIFI faster, synchs with iTunes faster, downloads emails faster and speeds up your web browsing.  The differences are very noticeable and enjoyable as a user.  The dual speakers are a nice change but I also use a lot of Bluetooth speakers to enhance the sound of the iPad.In my video I do a size and weight comparison to an iPad 2, an iPad 3 and the iPad Air.  I also show how the basic set up takes place and for advanced users you can just speed through that portion of the video.  The iPad 2 weighs 1 pound 5 1/8 ounces, the iPad 3 weighs 1 pound 7 1/8 ounces, and the iPad Air weighs 1 pound and \u00bc ounce.  The iPad Air is narrower but has the same screen size.  The left and right edges of the iPad are thinner on the sides of the useable screen and you can see that in the video.Here are the key improvements for me:* Much lighter in weight* Thinner, smaller design with the same screen size* Much faster when synching with iTunes* Much faster when browsing the web* Much faster when downloading emails* Stronger WIFI connection and faster WIFI synching* A more powerful AC wall adapter with 5.2 VDC and an output of 2.4 Amps.  It charges at 12 watts of power. It operates at 100 to 240 VAC and 50/60 Hz and it is UL approved.  It features folding AC wall plugs for easy packing when traveling.* Lower CPU and motion chip power consumption that makes the smaller/lighter internal battery last longer!  This is very noticeable!* As usual a beautiful high resolution retina screen with 2048 by 1536 resolution at 264 pixels per inch.

I would have paid a little more for the iPad Air with that sensor.This is still a 5 star product and I recommend it as a very good tablet.", "Date": "November 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Beautiful product, non-premium hardware.", "Author": "Avenging Taco", "ReviewID": "R52KR35VM0NQ3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have owned several Apple products, and the iPad is the most distinguished among Apple's line up relative to its competition.  The most compelling aspects of this tablet are the beautiful design, and the 10 hour battery life.  These are the two features that made me decide to purchase another Apple product irrespective of their business practices which try to squeeze money out of their customers by not supporting devices properly after they are released.After having used this product for over a month now, I can say it is an improvement over my iPad 1.  The browser now crashes on the original to the point of making it worthless.  My original iPad had 256 MB of RAM which is not enough to load a lot of modern web pages without the browser crashing.  That is why I had hoped the 1 GB of RAM in the iPad Air would be sufficient, and it has improved, yet I still find that the browser crashes on occasion.  The scroll latency is very subtle, but noticeable to me.  It doesn't really impact my usage, but it could create problems for people who game on their iPads.  Putting in 2 GB of RAM (which is what I have in my Nexus 4) does not cost that much, and would improve the performance greatly.  For a premium product, I expect the best, and Apple has consistently under-delivered on processing hardware which created the same problems all the way back to the iPhone 1 I purchased on launch day.I take 1 star off for business practices which burn through your pocket, and the second star is removed for needless low-RAM browser crashes that are still a problem on the latest iteration (which is likely planned to force relegation of old devices and compel new sales.)  Still, I can say that this is the best 10 inch tablet available, and android has no viable alternative worth purchasing.  If you can overlook the two biggest strikes I have against Apple, you should consider no other 10 inch tablet at this time.UPDATE 1/17/14Today I called into Apple support because my browser is crashing frequently.  I am now experiencing 5 - 10 browser crashes a day when it was only 2 - 3 times a week when I first purchased it.  Speaking with the Apple support technician, he said that they have not received many complaints about this issue yet, so I may be experiencing a rare software or hardware problem.  I looked through my crash log (which had over 100 crash reports in it since Nov. 11th) and the vast majority of them were low memory crashes.  However, the tablet did not operate this way when I initially purchased it, and it began to increase in frequency about 2 weeks ago.  Therefore I suspect that there is a software conflict (I still have 4 GBs of free flash hard drive space, so I doubt it is a conflict with virtual memory, although a RAM hardware problem is possible).  I went through some basic procedures the technician recommended, and I was advised to do a system wipe if the problems should persist.  I will test the tablet for a few days before wiping everything and starting over. I'll update this review once I am confident of what the issue was.", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Apple still rules the tablet world.", "Author": "Makavelli02", "ReviewID": "R3AWGSO5C50M8A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of let me tell you I am not an apple fanboy. I own and support samsung products. I carry a galaxy note 2 with me every day and would not consider an iPhone until the make some huge changes to it. Last year I bought a nexus 7 and loved it. Now that it's specs are getting a little dated I had to look for an upgrade. The new nexus 7 didn't impress me with it's dated CPU. So I looked to the note 2014 and the iPad air. I used both side by side and researched every detail. I sell these things for a living. The note is very impressive but, for all it's stats and hardware features it still struggles with simple movements. You can point out is 3 gigs of ram and the very good snapdragon 800 quad core CPU. Then you have apples 1 gig of ram with the measly dual core a7 CPU. ????? Now for the real world facts and it pains me to say this because I love android, but the fact is the a7 in the iPad air with it's upgraded clock speed at 1.39 gigs has yet to be matched in any bench mark from another mobile processor including the quad core s 800 by snapdragon. And with the future in mind the 64 bit tech is hard to beat. Them to the 1 gig of ram vs the 3 gigs in the note. If you can't use all that horsepower why put it in there. The air is twice as snappy as the note with no lag what so every. The note on the other hand lags even on swiping through home screens. It all comes down to the operating system apple remains king. Android may be pretty and customizable but that all comes at a cost. That cost is performance. You can take a car with 500 horsepower and put it on a curvy bending road. All that horsepower doesn't mean a thing. The car with 200 horsepower will still win by going straight.So I bought the air and love it.

I've had original iPad, iPad 3, and now the Air. Many people may say iPad is not worth the price for what it does, but in my case, it was worth every penny. I used iPad 3 and now the Air mostly for browsing the web, reading textbooks, and occasional gaming, and for these tasks iPad Air is perfect; not to mention, I've saved a couple of hundreds on textbooks already. Air is much lighter and faster than the other iPads I've had so far. Now, I can easily hold it longer while reading longer texts, and I can see the performance increase in web browsing and games.Mini vs. Air DilemmaI first got the new iPad Mini with Retina display, because the Apple sales person said it is identical to iPad Air in every aspect other than screen size. Of course it turned out to be wrong, since mini is a bit slower and has the display color accuracy issue. After a week, I went back and exchanged the mini for iPad Air. While mini is a wonderful tablet, I was keeping it much closer to my eyes that I liked to. Web browsing also suffered a lot on a smaller screen of the mini even with Retina. With iPad Air, everything is back to normal again, and I can browse the web more easily now.Wi-Fi vs. 4G CellularI have had the cellular version of iPad 3 and the original iPad. To be honest, I only enabled the service for a few months and disabled it afterwards. I find myself to be always near Wi-Fi networks, either at school or work, so I decided to get the Wi-Fi version this time. Another reason was that I can always turn on the Hot-Spot feature on my phone, and share the internet with iPad Air. Because of these points, it didn't make any sense to pay $130 more for the cellular version.Games and PerformanceI've tried a few games, including Dead Trigger 2, and the 3D performance is very good. The new A7 processor really shines here. I am sure new wave of 3D and 64-bits games will come to iPad pretty soon, and if you are into gaming, definitely go with larger than 16GB models. The web browsing performance has been increased as well, so you can browse the web more fluidly.ConclusionI am pretty happy with my purchase. The free iLife and iWork packages with the purchase of new iPad from Apple sealed the deal for me. It is much better than my previous iPad 3, and I definitely love the new reduced weight. The performance increase is also noticeable both in games and web browsing.

I am neither an apple/pc/android fanboy, I use the tool that gets the job done reliably. (Ever have a paper due and your computer breaks down?) I own a macbook, iphone, windows desktop, and had a Nexus 7 for a short time but wanted a tablet with a larger screen.So lets get down to it- initial impression was \"Wow!\" and I never realized how chunky or laggy the Nexus 7 was. The resolution, animations, user interface, and general build quality is superb in my opinion. It feels like a device \"that will get work done\". Unfortunately, the iPad out of the box feels like a digital storefront for the App store as opposed to something I can do school work on. Bluntly, the device is unnecessarily handicapped. For me to put my own videos on it, I have to use Handbrake and waste 3-4 hours to convert the movie to something the iPad can play. The Nexus 7 played almost any format out of the box. Using textbook PDFs is horrible, there are only a few quality apps that offer continuous scrolling. If your course requires mymathlabs, webassign, or one of those other edu-gimmicks to do homework, good luck, most of them require Flash which is unsupported. Then I went to use safari.. advertisements everywhere! Same with every free app, constant advertisements! Occasionally I have to download PDF to read for course work. Ain't happening in safari- there is no way to download and the page will refresh if you close the app. Good luck reading where there is no wifi.Then I jailbroke it, installed f.lux, adblockerNetworks, safari downloader, nitrous, retinapad, vplayer video player, and videopane. That took care of the blinding blue light at night time, killed off 90% of advertisements, I can download files now, iPhone only apps are now in HD, I can watch almost any format of video too. Now the device is useful!After that, I installed DocsToGo to read PDFs with continuous scrolling and to write papers. I also HIGHLY recommend Notes Plus if you intend on hand writing notes. Lastly, I would suggest getting the \"Papers\" app (no typo) to read PDFs with multiple columns.Overall, iPad has a lot of potential but is held back by Apples walled garden. After jailbreaking and eliminating the majority of the artificial handicaps, I feel OK with heading to school only with it and not worrying about it not being capable of doing something.

I own an iPad 2 and 3 and now this new iPad Air version. My main reasons for updating were that I literally fill up my 64 GIG iPad every day or two with videos and photos that I shoot. Having this larger version at 128 GIG allows me to work longer and add more to my iPad. In addition this new version is much lighter and easier to use all day long. Even though the battery is smaller in capacity than my iPad 3 the battery life is longer and it is very noticeable. This is because the faster A7 CPU and the motion chip actually use less power.Please watch my video as I go into more details in it.I immediately noticed the increase in speed. The unit connects to the WIFI faster, synchs with iTunes faster, downloads emails faster and speeds up your web browsing. The differences are very noticeable and enjoyable as a user. The dual speakers are a nice change but I also use a lot of Bluetooth speakers to enhance the sound of the iPad.In my video I do a size and weight comparison to an iPad 2, an iPad 3 and the iPad Air. I also show how the basic set up takes place and for advanced users you can just speed through that portion of the video. The iPad 2 weighs 1 pound 5 1/8 ounces, the iPad 3 weighs 1 pound 7 1/8 ounces, and the iPad Air weighs 1 pound and \u00bc ounce. The iPad Air is narrower but has the same screen size. The left and right edges of the iPad are thinner on the sides of the useable screen and you can see that in the video.Here are the key improvements for me:* Much lighter in weight* Thinner, smaller design with the same screen size* Much faster when synching with iTunes* Much faster when browsing the web* Much faster when downloading emails* Stronger WIFI connection and faster WIFI synching* A more powerful AC wall adapter with 5.2 VDC and an output of 2.4 Amps. It charges at 12 watts of power. It operates at 100 to 240 VAC and 50/60 Hz and it is UL approved. It features folding AC wall plugs for easy packing when traveling.* Lower CPU and motion chip power consumption that makes the smaller/lighter internal battery last longer!

The tablet is as fast as anything out right now, to be honest I don't play games but in terms of everyday use everything was fine...but at the same time every iPad that I've used before felt fast as well, I have heard of some issues with tablet optimization for iOS7 but I haven't encountered any. The screen is bright and sharp, text is really easy to read vs a higher PPI tablet (nexus 10) I really couldnt tell a difference with the extra pixels. The color on the iPad is very good once again this is to be expected as Apple always makes high quality devices.The only Cons I can't think of is the speaker placement and feel of the glass (as mentioned in other reviews). The iPad has \"stereo speakers\" which are located on the bottom, I really wish they would have put one on each side instead of both on one side. Watching youtube or netflix in landscape is kind of weird since all the side comes from the right side, kind of defeats the purpose of stereo speakers imo since I never watch fullscreen videos in portrait mode. The nexus 7and 10  have  really good desigsn for speakers that I wish Apple would've adopted.The other con is the feel of the screen, to be honest it feels a bit cheap...compared to previous iPads and the nexus devices the feel of the screen on the iPad air is the worst. It feels like plastic and it just doesnt feel solid when you push down. I'm sure this is a sacrifice that Apple had to make in order to reduce the weight to me the benefits of having a lighter, smaller device outweigh the feel of the screen (something that I'll eventually get used to).Other notes: I haven't used the camera, sorry but I never use the camera on a tablet to take pictures but from what I hear from reviews it takes pretty much what you would expect from a camera on a tablet. I probably wouldn't upgrade if I had an iPad 3 or iPad 4 unless your someone who has to have the newest tech or is absolutely miserable with the weight.If you do want to purchase it you can get it for 479.99 + Tax, go to Walmart's website or you can have any other retailer price match it.All in all this is an excellent tablet besides the minor gripes...the only Android tablet I can see competing with the iPad is the Nexus 10 v2 if it ever comes out...and while I preferred the Nexus 10 for media viewing, real stereo speakers and OS, reading textbooks felt a little cramped and since I'm using this tablet primarily for \"school\" the 4:3 factor fit my needs better.So there it is proof that you can be a fan of both Android and iOS :)", "Date": "November 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Experience", "Author": "Dragember", "ReviewID": "R3RZ0F8IARVY1A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My first tablet was a Nexus 7, and while I enjoyed it immenseilly I was ultimately disappointed in how slow it eventually got (speedy at Christmas, snail slow come April despite factory reset and other attempts to speed it up. Bought my brother a new nexus 7 that summer only to discover its speed was on par with the Nexus I currently owned. Very bizarre). I was skeptical whether or not I would enjoy a tablet experience, so the Nexus 7 was none the less a great first tablet. It could do anything any other tablet could without putting a dent in your pocket.I decided to get the iPad Air this season, specifically the wifi 32gb space gray version.Never owned an iPad before, so I can't really tell you how the models compare,However some things I note, the screen is rather large (duh) which does make typing with the onscreen keyboard difficult. However the screen real estate and quality is stunning, and if typing is a huge issue for you there is the iPad mini and other tablets. That's the trade off, and this is always a choice you have to make between 10 inch vs. 7inch tablets, no matter what brand you're looking at.The glass does feel rather thin, and I am concerned about its durability. I have read that the screen is durable however, and this perception is due to the lightening of the device causing the screen to sound thinner. Supposedly I will be able to confirm this with a case, as the addition of the case will give the tapping of the screen a deeper sound. Apparently it all comes down to acoustics - though a specification on glass thickness versus previous models would be nice.The design of the tablet is exquisite, definitely some top of the line material choices. The tablet has a VERY sturdy feel.Lots of free apps come with this tablet, which all work excellently and efficiently. There is no hesitation between tasks, and the speed is phenomenal.Overall I noticed the quality of apps and how they work on the operating system is MUCH better with apple than it was with android. However, the apple App Store isn't very easy to navigate. Google store is much more user friendly.No widgets, makes customizabibility limited.Multitasking is an ease with this tablet due to gestures. I love how well the gestures work. You can swipe between apps.Battery lasts insanely long, mine averages 12 hours of use.Hasn't overheated (vague warmth can be felt), even with gameplay.Sound from speakers at bottom of iPad sound full. Other tablets I've played with have a tin-metal quality sound emit from them, as though the speakers strain to emit a hearable noise.All iPad Airs, according to Apple's website, come with a complimentary one year limited warranty.Cool front AND back microphones work together to cancel out noise when using skype and FaceTime. Sounds very clear and crisp, I recommend you check out some videos on it.Overall I would say an A+ tablet. I mainly listed some concerns and observations, but that aside this thing is amazing! I love and, it from what I've heard of previous models, I'll hopefully be using this tablet for years to come (number one selling point for me is that apple devices function excellently passed a year).Update December 3, 2013:I've noticed a bizarre memory leak that occurs whenever I watch videos using Apple's video app (love them digital copies). I was testing the video streaming and after I noticed entire GBs were gone! After shutting down the app and fiddling around I realized that the iPad stores memory it buffers and keeps it hostage. However, after going back to the app and quickly loading the same movie and exiting before it begins to buffer the memory reappears. That being said, I wouldn't be surprised that if you watched movies completely through your memory would be restored each time. Still this is a rather large flaw on Apple's part, and I'm not sure if it occurs with any of the other video streaming apps. I'll be sending them a message to see if they're working on a patch for it.", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best tablet just got better", "Author": "G.

We turned it up all the way and it definitely gets loud, so it's not like the speakers aren't good. It's a minor gripe for an overall great tablet experience. I would buy with full confidence if you are in the market for a new tablet.", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent, but could be unbeatable", "Author": "JE Craig", "ReviewID": "R34PGIBEBQG7TV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First of all, I have never owned an ipad before but I have used other's ipads and was impressed with them.  I also have a motorola xoom and it doesn't even come close to the ease of use and just generally aesthetics of this ipad.  Its probably best that I break it down into pros and cons to give the most accurate picture I can of what I have found since I bought myself, my wife and my son all the new ipad Airs.--The Good--The business apps I use are all exactly what I hoped for.  I use Chrome for browser and it looks incredible.  When tablets came out, this is what I imagined browsing the internet should look like on a tablet.  The form factor is great, and the Air is as light as advertised.  Despite other's claims of durability issues, I have found it to be quite durable even with my minimal case.  Movies in correct format play flawlessy and my music sounds great.  Paired with some good headphones, long plane trips become tolerable in the worst of seats.  Facetiming with family is a breeze and the 'cool' factor is definitely still present.--The Bad--There are also some cons which I think takes the Air down a half star to a star.  First off the 16GB model which I purchased for my wife from a big box store after I purchased my 64GB from Amazon is simply not enough memory.  I know thats a choice etc but for those that are purchasing for the first time, do NOT buy the 16 GB model unless you plan on mostly using for browsing the internet.  Apps + music + movies will fill up your 16 (actually less after what IOS takes up) gigs very quickly.Second, they should have put a little more RAM in.  The browser occaisonally crashes and there is definitely some latency on scrolling for more content intensive pages.Lastly a few random complaints; the screen also seems dimmer than the ipad with retina (last generation), there is no additional storage, and there seems to be a growing number of junk apps/games.--The Ugly--I will preface this with this: only power users are likely to encounter the ugly.Synching with Apple TV is not as easy as advertised.  Sometimes the air icon shows up, sometimes it doesn't.You can play MKV files but it is painful.  You need a third party player, then you have to transfer movies via http (drag and drop doesn't work), and you will not see where that space went, should you forget about things you've transferred via that method.If you have a home media server and use a PC, itunes + network drives + adding files to the ipad reminds me of the days of the 2400 baud modem.  You wait, and you wait, and you wait.  Anything you really want to transfer, transfer it from your network drive to your pc, then add to library, then transfer to ipad.--Overall--I still prefer this to my android pad or any other tablets I have encountered. The pros outweigh the cons if you have the money to spend considering how much more these are than comperable android tablets.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wifes Toy", "Author": "victor a. quaranta jr", "ReviewID": "RMRD11B7V8WY8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife is very thrifty and seldom ask for anything.

Others about the brightness...indeed I do have it cranked all the way up but the brightness is nowhere as bright as what is found on the Samsung Note 10.1 2014 edition, nor the iPad4 and my most recent purchase the Samsung Note 8. All 3 when cranked all the way up are much brighter than the iPad Air.I will be buying the new Google nexus 7(even with all the GPS and multi-touch issues) for the upcoming holidays but even in the store, that too seems much brighter...I am very dismayed at this lack of brightness from the Air but it is still more than adequate for indoors. I have not tried it outdoors nor will I as this is not my \"outdoor\" tablet...lol.I like Apple and the tight integration of their apps and the reason many including myself continue to buy their products. I do feel the price for this latest iteration is them trying to make money at our expense. WHO HERE DOES NOT KNOW IN THEIR HEART THAT APPLE IS TRYING TO GET IN ON THE CHRISTMAS RUSH AND PUT THE AIR AND THE NEW MINI WITHOUT THE FINGERPRINT FEATURES FOUND ON THE NEW IPHONE...COME MARCH MAYBE APRIL, APPLE WILL UPDATE THE IPAD AIR TO INCLUDE THAT FEATURE.I will continue to buy Apple mostly because their store has apps that are better, with more choices and work extremely well with their devices. I think this product is a 3 1/2 Stars at best and mostly for the size and weight reduction that is very significant. I feel the \"glass\" is too thin but seems to be durable as I have really been typing a lot on it as well as playing several games that require a lot of tapping. I am very happy with the size reduction but feel the brightness is not up to par with other new tablets or the iPad4.Recently the Safari browser has been \"crashing\" a lot over the past week in that when you tap on a hyperlink, the browser will basically disappear off the screen. None of the tabs close but it just disappears and returns you to the home screens. I also am finding the browser will get stuck/freeze for several minutes before resuming. I have several calls in with apple support and they are looking into the issues.Other issues is the VIDEO app, if you play a video via streaming not downloading and leave it somewhere like the middle or so on, it actually reduces your available memory by the amount you have watched from what I can glean. IT IS LIKE DOWNLOADING THE MOVIE TO THE POINT YOU HAVE WATCHED IT TO EVEN THOUGH YOU SELECTED THE STREAMING LINK. If you do this with several movies, you can basically wipe out your free memory. I find it difficult to clear the buffer and have basically learned to tell the app not to display any movies then to display movies then play the movie but move the slider to the beginning and press stop playing then done. Of these many steps I eventually clear the buffer but I am not sure which of all these steps actually is what does it if any!Oh lastly, the WI-fi is fantastic.FINAL RATING IS 3 1/2 STARS...MAYBE 4 IF NOT FOR THE BRIGHTNESS ISSUE.First I own iPad 2 and 4 and Samsung Note 10.1 2014 edition.I like...not love...the new iPad Air as it is faster both in operating the software apps and graphic intensive apps. The apps continue to be fantastic for all the pads not just the Air.Apple did a great job on the weight but FEEL STRONGLY THAT THE NEW SCREEN IS NOT NEARLY AS BRIGHT AS MY iPad 4 NOR DOES IT EVEN FEEL LIKE GLASS.As I type this review on the Air, the \"cheap tapping\" feel of this glass leaves me wondering how durable this glass is. It feels thin and makes a tapping sound not found on the more solid glass on my other two iPads.Oh I am keeping the Air for the faster processors but feel Apple has put out a product whose screen will not be as durable as prior pads.I can see it flex when I push down on it with minimal effort and have some light distortion when I press down like old type LED TVS.Apple over prices their products because they can and really did so on this iteration of their iPad. In my estimation the glass feels like plastic and the brightness is much diminished when compared to my iPad 4 and so must have a higher profit margin with all these cost cutting that resulted in a new iPad that for all practically purposes is just faster but not as solidly built as prior pads.Time will tell on the screen and maybe this is the way all tablets are headed to achieve the weight reduction and thinness. I love the ability to hold the Air in one hand comfortably for much longer than any of my current tablets. I am OK to sacrifice the glass quality as long as the touch screen does not suffer or long term screen reliability.I wish Apple would splurge and include a 6 foot charging cord...OMG $600 for 32GB and the cord is so short still after all this time...lol.", "Date": "November 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worst iPad Ever", "Author": "SanPa", "ReviewID": "R6AXD3MO1PMIA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I'll get right to it.

Lightweight, a joy to use", "Author": "Gearhead Mania", "ReviewID": "R3K3EAML83WH3K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using Android products mainly, but I first delved into touch devices with the first generation iPod Touch so I am familiar with iOS to an extent. For the past few years I've used Android FroYo, Gingerbread, Ice Cream Sandwich, and now Jelly Bean. I also have a Kindle Fire HD. The iPad Air is my first iPad, and I chose to go with the iPad Air because it has a much higher resolution than the best Android Tablets, with a really slick dual-core CPU and quad-core GPU. The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 is a close second but is more expensive than the iPad Air which was on sale during a Black Thursday promotion. The Galaxy Tab 3 just doesn't even come close with the screen resolution.The iOS 7 interface is OK. I prefer Jelly Bean's interface. Although clean and simple, the iOS interface isn't intuitive. There are too many sub-menus interwoven in odd areas. To change language, I have to go into no less than 2 sub-menu layers. Siri is fine, but Google Now/Google Search was far more intelligent and effective. Siri's default US female voice is much more realistic and smoother, but Google Now's other voices along with IVONA rectify that situation fairly well.The battery life on the iPad Air is very good. After an hour or so, I'm still above 90%. The WiFi is fast, and the overall UI is smooth. The movie/graphics playback is super fast. I can watch Flash based movies/video within the Safari browser without any hiccups.Compared to my 7 inch Kindle Fire HD, I felt that the 9.7 inch (Air's display size) or 10 inch screen size is just right, but only because the iPad Air is extremely thin and lightweight. The 7 inch KFHD is large enough to be usable for reading magazines, but it is not a good use of space. I have to flick through 2 or 3 screens while the iPad Air will show the entire page (in a very legible font size) in one screen. The KFHD is also heavy, so hopefully the new KFHDX is thinner and lighter.I used to make fun of Apple for going with the Lightning connector, but after using it up close, I can understand why it is innovative. It is made out of a solid chunk of metal with contacts on both sides. There's no \"right\" way of plugging it in, unlike USB where I constantly flip it around trying to figure out which side is up. But I still feel micro-USB is the right way to go, due to its universal acceptance with devices. The included 12W power adapter can actually charge the iPad Air at up to 14W of power based on what I saw with my Kill-A-Watt.With respect to the hardware and design, the iPad Air is outstanding at this price point. Aside from the hardware, the bulk of the iPad Air and Apple experience centers around iTunes, iCloud, and other Apple software. This is an area where I feel Google far surpasses Apple. The Apple ID system is cumbersome and annoying to use. I had to login probably a dozen times during the registration process, and buying/installing free apps required me to enter my password each time. It didn't seem like all of Apple's programs were tightly integrated because I had to use my Apple ID each time I fired up the apps for the first time. Once everything was setup and installed, it seemed fine. That said, installing and running Google's apps on the iPad was significantly less painful. The first time I used my Google account for an app (I believe it was YouTube), all of the other Google Apps recognized me and started syncing. Google Now/Google Search also puts Siri to shame, albeit Siri seems more \"human\" with basic functions. For instance, asking about the weather, Siri actually told me (In Chinese and English) that the weather wasn't very good at 27F. Doing basic searches, Siri and Google Now are about equal, but Google Now seems more intelligent with some of the intermediate activities like unit conversions or advanced searches.I never liked iTunes in the past, and my opinion has not changed with ITunes 11. It is overly complex to use. With Google/Android, I can access Play with a browser and have new apps sent to my devices with the greatest of ease. Syncing calendar events, email, contacts, etc... is also far easier with just using a browser versus the iTunes program on my PC. The good news is that iTunes isn't too bad to use on the iPad. Running Zinio, Conde Naste magazine apps, and other apps was smooth and problem-free.For those that like to use their tablet for browsing or reading magazines, or watching videos, I'd highly recommend a 10 inch display (the Air is 9.7\" but falls in the range). My 7 inch Kindle Fire is fine to use, but it is frustrating to use for magazines due to the amount of panning that is needed. After using the iPad Air, my Samsung Galaxy S3 feels claustrophobic with its 4.9\" display.Overall: 5/5 stars, the iPad Air is a well-designed device with great hardware especially with the Black Thursday/Friday promotions. However, Apple has a lot of catching up to do with respect to its software designs. I very much prefer Google's ecosystem as it is more \"cloud-based\" than what Apple is trying to do.

I am not a game player or a number cruncher so the speed of the ipad 3 was just fine for me.What did get my attention was the weight! I had already bought the new ipad mini, which is super cool and a lot of fun.I actually intend to keep it. However, as good as it's screen is, I cannot see me using it 10 hours a day.

I needed to put a case on it, making it 2 pound device. Compared to the Ipad Air, which is about 1 pound, that was almost a 50% reduction in weight! The reason the reduction is so much, is I do not feel I need a case with the Air. I have covered it with clear coat all over and that is it. I do not seeing it slipping out of my hands. However, when I travel, I will use a 5 oz cover or just a Smart Cover (3.5 oz).I know it can be dangerous, not using a case, but I am extremely careful and i bought the special Apple warranty. Besides, isn't the reason we spend so much on these because they weigh so little and are aesthetically pleasing?It is too beautiful to cover up.

Which meant I really couldn't tell you if they worked well or not.  I'd only had it for a day and the screen froze.  Could only go back to the home screen, then loose any work one might have done. Couldn't turn it off. Then, when I was getting ready to put it back in the box, amazingly it decided to work. The set-up wizard was super fast helping this technically challenged person set up and link  all her accounts.  I REALLY liked that it was a tablet and a small laptop as it came with an awesome keypad. So then I started downloading music and wanted to hear the small ball speaker that came in the bundle. The female plug in the air was not quite the right size. I couldn't get a snug fit, also tried with the ear buds and another speaker. And as I fidgeted with the plugs to get a secure connection to receive a signal, the song would stop playing and the volume on the screen kept going up and down. Is this supposed to happen???? As for the sound, I wasn't expecting much from such a thin tablet. The speakers were on the back side but I'm not sure if speakers could be placed in the front. But since the speaker plugs won't fit, what's the point? You'd need to buy some blue-tooth speakers to really hear better soundIt would be hard for me to compare the ipad air to other tablets as this would have been my first touch-screen device other than my android smart phone.I'd have to agree with previous reviews.

Having an iTunes account makes this so very simple. Also, I have a ton of iTunes credit (I always ask for iTune gift cards whenever the occassion arises). In addition to iTunes, I love Pages. When I got this app, it was free! However, if you do a lot of word processing, you might want to invest in this much needed addition.

No touch ID which is ok because I don't like having a pass code on my iPad anyways where on the 5S it is greatly appreciated. Same fantastic resolution as its past 2 models but now has better power to push them all. Gaming and productivity apps look and feel great and I can use them to do everything I need.", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best tablet in the market that i could find for my wife THOUGH i am a Android fan!", "Author": "Moze", "ReviewID": "R2NB4JHKWOVJQT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Though it was $15 more from Apple, I am okay with it.

As an upgrade from prior iPad's, the Air is going to be the biggest reason to upgrade in recent memory. Users from the 3rd Generation down will see substantial benefits to speed alone.What Works:It's substantially lighter. Easier to hold and use while watching movies or reading a book.It's substantially faster. The upgraded processor is so fast that most users will be future proofed for the next two years or more. 64 bit processing will give this tablet some legs.the battery charges substantially faster. This is a nicer reason to upgrade than most realize. The Air's battery is smaller, and holds it's charge very well compared to older models on iOS7. I had problems on my 3rd gen keeping it charged compared to the zippier charging Air.Lightning port is much more convenient, easier to plug in compared to 3rd generation and back.Speakers seem to pack more of a punch.What doesn't work:the screen has a slightly hollow and thin feel on the finger. As a consequence of a lighter tablet it's expected that the display lost some of it's heft.the volume buttons are spaced a little too far apart for me. Harder to press.volume speakers are annoyingly where you'd hold the tablet horizontally.-----That's my impressions with the tablet. My recommendation is if you have $500 or more to spend on a tablet, the iPad Air is going to be your first choice. Android hasn't been competitive in this section of the market. If you're looking for a less expensive, smaller tablet, then you're going to be looking at the Kindle devices or the Android devices.For Apple users, i'd recommend people on the 1st and 2nd gen devices take the plunge, the changes are enough to warrant the upgrade. 3rd Gen users are in the grey area. They are not going to see any difference in screen quality, and the speed of the Air may not be too large to matter for basic use. 4th Gen users are totally fine where they are.", "Date": "November 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "REPLACED MY IPAD 3, WAS IT A GOOD DECISION? LETS FIND OUT. IN DEPTH.", "Author": "Kanwar Anand", "ReviewID": "R104L6A6P3VSAW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my third iPad. I decided on a 32GB because I wanted to load movies on it and a lot of music and not worry about space. I mean when they announce a new version of iOS the last thing I wanted to do was delete something dear to me. I was replacing my iPad 3 16GB with an iPad Air 32GB. There have been many changes. Are these changes enough to warrant the need for an upgrade? I am still not entirely certain but I am more happy than sad about doing that. I haven't been able to sell my iPad 3 but its still looking for a new home. So guys, here is what I like about the iPad Air, what I don't like much and what are some key features or new introductions to this device.The Positives of Upgrading to iPad Air -1) It is lighter, the surface area around the display has been reduced, the design is not revolutionary by any length of a realistic understanding of science but it still has the same battery life. It has lost that annoying 30 pin connector which seems so inconvenient to the new lightning port. I can use this one hand, I can expect the same battery life, the volume button on the iPad 3 seemed less delicate, the iPad Air definitely feels a lot more delicate than the iPad 3 which seems so robust now when I pick it up. But overall I would give them 4 stars for the design changes.  I wish it never heated up though but purely from the WEIGHT difference I think its good, the screen for some reason looks better, it must be the upgraded graphic chip.2) The Sound - This is the biggest winner for me. Imagine not having to turn the sound to 100% on your iPad air. It rivals my matchbook air in terms of how loud it is, yes it isn't as loud or roomy or filling but it is more than satisfying. They now have two speakers so its a stereo sound. It is louder than my iPhone 5 and certainly more clear, catchy, bass adoring than I would image from an iPad. This was the surprise winner for me. A bit of a let down in terms of design is that if you're lying and watching a film in portrait mood the speaker sound may be muffled by your stomach/body part in contact with the base of the iPad air. The solution is LANDSCAPE mode. The two speakers are now located on the left and right side of the charging port. No complaints on this. The iPad 3 is maybe 30% as loud as the iPad air.3) Battery Life/Faster Charging Speed - I don't know why but I feel the iPad 3 had a longer battery when it was new. A new apple iPad will last you so long, it will need for you to bore it to death to bring it from 100% to 64%. Yes, this is the case with the new iPad but it isn't as good but overall the fact that charging time seems to have reduced by half is a big big big big winner for me. So overall, no complaints. I don't get 13-14 hours like I used to with my iPad 3. I get 11 hours. Yes, I make the best use of the new sound feature. The fact that it charges faster means I don't need to pull it out before 100% and this is a good thing for the battery. With the iPad 3, I have to wait for it to be 100% charged and it can take unto 8 hours. This has been reduced by almost half and I feel 4-5 hours will give you a 100%.4) Processor - The iOS 7 clearly stalls a bit on the iPad 3. Did I notice this before buying the iPad Air? Yes cause my iPhone 5 was faster than the iPad 3. If you're playing quiz up, everything loads in seconds, if you are browsing, it goes boom boom boom like my macbook air. Well nothing quite compares to browsning on the AIR but this is very good. iPad Air is the best device for youtube because of the loud speaker, I can sit with it for hours and discover various things. The processor seems to heat a lot less. There  is never a lag on anything. It doesnt think so much.5) Camera - Camera has improved from the iPad 3. Both the front and the back is more defined. Do I use this? Why wouldn't i?COULD HAVE BEEN BETTERS' WITH THIS IPAD AIR -1) Headphone Jack Placement/Volume Output -  This isn't as loud when using with headphones as the iPad 3 used to be. It is a more customised sound. The headphone jack is located at the same place where it used to be but because the surface area is smaller, I have found that when I am lying down and using my iPad AIR, the wires often get a bit entangled.2) The iPad Air still heats up. I can't for the life of me figure out why I pay a company so much money when they make a product that heats up on full brightness. This is one hell of an annoying feature.3) The back on the iPad Air, the volume buttons, the power button, the menu button - they all seem a bit too delicate in comparison with the iPad 3. This is just an intuition or impression but I can't help but feel it needs to be treated gently.4) Safari has been needing an overhaul for the longest and I feel they need a better browser than the one they have right now. It often freezes on my iPad 3. It should be perfect like iMessage is perfect, like FaceTime is close to perfect, like email is perfect, it isn't quite up there. I would give it a 6/10 in terms of potential.5) iBooks - I read on my iPad more than anything else but the iBooks software also needs some more options of backgrounds and schemes. Apple plays safe for far too long but they need to give more options to make READERS WANT TO READ MORE.6) Syncing iTunes is a bit confusing. There should be more education given to all customers about preferred type of WIFI networks, sometimes applications don't update, I have no idea why they are doing this. I have to go to airplane mode and then go back up. The iCloud feature needs 10GB and Apple need to stop being a cheapskate.Conclusion  -Get the iPad Air if you are looking for something with good design quality, good battery, an extra lightning cable (half joke) , something faster, smoother...this is about a 31% improvement over the iPad 3. Thats a big deal.Of my iPhone, macbook Air, iPad Air - I have always liked the iPads the most. They have reliable battery and never ever ever die on you like the other two. Its that simple and that keen.If they take into account some of the things I didn't like about this product, Apple can be made better overall.

She had been using an earlier iPad so was already familiar with tablet technology.

For some reason, iPads are popular among moms and grand moms for taking wrestling videos.  She then transfers the videos to her MacBook Pro, writes them to an optical disc and gives it to the coach for analysis.  Video transfers are achieved when she syncs the iPad Air with her MBP.  She keeps it protected in a pink Otterbox, which gives the iPad a completely different look and feel.iPad Air is thinner and lighter than previous iPads and comes with a sharp Retina display.  I don't know if it's the best tablet for your money.  I do know she keeps it close at all times, and though she doesn't qualify as a geek she's worked in software maintenance most of her professional life.

This is the only tablet I have looked forward to using.Now for more serious activities like gaming and other intensive applications, the iPad has no problems what so ever. The graphics are very smooth, almost life-like.  From the outside, this is the most beautiful tablet hands down. From the chamfered edges to the sleek aluminum back, this is a high quality device. Most other tablets are made out of cheap plastics, not this one. Everything feels well made and solid. Even though apple chose to use metals and other high end materials, the iPad remains one of the lightest and thinnest full size tablets you can buy. Another high point for the iPad air its the battery. It seems to go on forever! After using it throughout the day, I end up with 70 to 80 percent battery! Its unbelievably how much juice this thing holds! Some miscellaneous things about the iPad that push it even further over the top are the decent cameras and the excellent microphones and speakers. The speakers have a good base tone and very clear high pitches. Overall I would recommend this tablet to anyone looking for a device that can do pretty much anything.

I can't find a thing about it to complain about (except the price). It's just outstanding in every way (display, size, weight, available apps, and operating system). It also addressed certain niggling complaints I had with my earlier iPads. With regard to other devices I tried, the latest Kindle Fires were excellent (great displays - and the price was right) but not sufficiently versatile to meet all my needs. The LG 8.3 was another excellent Android tablet but it didn't seem like a truly finished product (couldn't, for instance, lock it in landscape mode - very frustrating when trying to use it while lying in bed). It also seemed a bit pricy for what it was at nearly the price of an iPad Mini Retina (a tablet I was seriously considering for its portability). For what it's worth, the only tablets I tried, or even wanted to try, were those with very high pixel density displays. Later I also ruled out the true 7 inch devices with their 22 square inch displays (the iPad Mini's is 30 square inches, the LG 8.3's is 31, while the iPad Air's is 45).

I've noticed this with my \"old\" Samsung Galaxy Tab 7 Plus, but this may not matter to some people.The Kindle HDX and Nexus 7 (2013) are, in that order, reported to have better screens- ppi and gamut display. However I'm not interested in buying too much into the Amazon App Store because I'm already in the plain Android ecosystem. The Samsung tablet line is not in consideration because I got burned by how the copy and paste function just stops working- a reset would fix it and soon after it would stop working. This issue first showed itself months after I got the device. I also wasn't interested in taking the time to jailbreak the Samsung tablet for that reason alone.I recently got a deal on the Nexus 7 (2013) and I'm getting it this week. I may keep it as a backup tablet and it's a plus that I'm already in the Android ecosystem. It has 2GB of RAM instead of Apple's current 1GB of RAM standard. It also comes with stock Android and the operating system can be easily upgraded without relying on mods. I'm hoping it will last 5 years but I've learned from the Amazon customer reviews that hardware quality control is an issue.Now back to the iPad Air. Aside from the screen I wanted the \"Apple Experience\" of \"It just works.\" I like using a tablet for browsing and reading books. I also liked the idea of having access to apps that are exclusive to Apple. I've had the iPad Air for a little over a week and I'm really enjoying the bigger screen. I'm not sure I can really switch back to a smaller screen. I've downloaded a few apps, cooking related, that are exclusive to iOS and they're nice to have. Multitouch gesture is ok but the Android way of switching between apps and viewing running apps are more elegant.Why I took off three stars is because the iPad Air crashes a lot. It got to the point that I'd add a tab on Safari and it would crash even though I only had two other tabs open. I installed Chrome and the crashes happened less but they did not disappear. Search for iOS 7 crashes and low memory and you'll see this is a problem with a lot of iOS devices since the iOS 7 was introduced. I noticed other apps doing the same thing but maybe because I use them less I don't see them crashing as often.I had set up a phone appointment with Apple Support on Sunday and was told that upgrading to iOS 7.0.4 via WiFi might have caused the iOS to not fully update. I couldn't stay on the phone for too long so yesterday I did reset my tablet and set the iPad as New. I didn't buy their reasoning but I did like the Customer Support experience- setting up an appointment online etc.I really like the bigger screen and it's probably better for my eyes so I'm keeping the device. I'm also counting on Apple to fix the issue sooner rather than later- in various forums you'll read about people resetting their iOS device and doing multiple exchanges with no relief from the crashing. I will sign up for Apple Care+ which includes 2 Years of Tech Support and Accidental Damage so I can exchange the device if needed.", "Date": "December 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not Worth the Money", "Author": "Galen V.", "ReviewID": "R3OIN717XK4VME", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Let's face it, Apple produces highly polished products with a rich app ecosystem.  Many apps are optimized with animation and are even better on a larger screen, but....This device is not worth $500, its not worth $400, it probably should retail between $300 and 350, and here's why:*Locked in system. You have very little customization options. Yes, you can change wallpaper and move icons around the homescreen, but that's about it. No making the device an extension of your personality like Android.*Speakers. For being the most popular gadget on earth, why are there not stereo speakers on this device (one on each end of the tablet)? This is a serious design flaw that makes watching videos a huge drag because sound is muffled especially if the device is leaning on your lap.*Multitasking is a joke. These devices can only perform one task at a time. Apples competitors such as Samsung and Microsoft have already addressed this in their tablets, why hasn't Apple?*Screen Casting. This is not equipped with Miracast or have an HDMI out port. This means if you want to show your devices screen on a TV, you can't without buying a bunch of overpriced adaptors and cords.*Maps.

Up until then, I had never owned an Apple product. I have always had Windows pc\u2019s and I have an Android phone (Galaxy S4).I read that people just love the iPad\u2019s and thought it would be time to try out an Apple product. I bought it from T-Mobile to get their free data promotion. Now that I\u2019ve had one for about 3 months my overall opinion is \u201cmeh\u201d. It\u2019s ok.I don\u2019t hate it. It\u2019s light & portable. It\u2019s great for watching movies and listening to music. However, there are limitations that make me wonder why the devices are so popular. For example, Swype doesn\u2019t work on iPad\u2019s and if you\u2019ve ever used Swype on an Android device you know it\u2019s a great feature but one I consider very basic. True multi-tasking doesn\u2019t exist and you just don\u2019t realize how much you\u2019ll miss it until you don\u2019t have it. You can\u2019t print, for example, pages 1,3,&10 of a pdf. Instead, you can only choose a range, such as 1 thru 3. I still remember one of my first calls to Applecare+, where some young woman explained to me that you can\u2019t do a search in a pdf. She actually suggested that I add hundreds of doctors that were in the pdf to my contact list so that I could then find individual doctors. I quickly ended that call. The Apple browser, Safari, is slow. Chrome, on the other hand, is fast. These are only small examples but in general, the iPad seems to be much less flexible than my Window\u2019s computers or Android phone.As an aside, the support on Applecare+ varies widely. I have been connected to people that seem knowledgeable but have also had plenty of people that knew less about the iPad then I did, even after only 1 months use. Many of the young women referred to my iPad as an IPhone and didn\u2019t have a clue how to help me.They are also expensive. I bought the 32GB version and thought it was a rip off to pay $100 for the extra 16GB.Now, my iPad Air is 3 months old and needs to be exchanged under warranty. After 10 minutes of use it can\u2019t access the web anymore. Regardless of whether you use a browser or an app. They had me reset it back to the factory default but it didn\u2019t fix the problem. It's stayed in a case and never left the house. It's been babied. I\u2019ve never had any device fail after only 3 months use.I really wanted to love this device and thought I would based on other people\u2019s feedback. It just hasn\u2019t worked out for me though. It\u2019s adequate, but not great, and hasn\u2019t lived up to my expectations.", "Date": "February 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Don't plan on enjoying you headphones..if you enjoy music.", "Author": "Gery", "ReviewID": "R124IJA0MRHZN6", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Air pad problems....I have 2 iPhones, iPad 3 gen, new air pad.

I was a previous Iphone user that moved on to Android because I didnt like the size of the 5.  I have two kids so consumer level usability is high on my list especially with a son that has autism.My choice came down to a samsung or the ipad since the nexus 10 2 is still MIA. :)  The samsung had several things going for it.  MicroSD, customization and control, mutliple user profiles but to be honest their overlay is a huge turn off and the plether backing with fake stitching just looks horrid.  I would say that the plastics are fine but why bother with fake stitching? I spent time in a B&M; and the feel was good, but visually as a whole it felt less...high end even with the price being in the same range as the IPad.  With several cloud storage options and knowing that I would be using it for light work related items and sharing it with my kids to some extent the MicroSD while nice was not compelling.  I do wish apple would realize that multiple user accounts would be helpful because that is one of the things that almost moved me to the samsung.  Both screens of course are amazing and I have to give it to the samsung on using a better aspect ratio for media, but the samsung felt klugy when trying to use it in portrait.  So with all this being debated in my head for a few weeks back and forth I decided on the IPad.  As an aside, I love the build quality and would have seriously considers a Kindle Fire HDX but the lack of the google play store put it out of contention.  It is one thing to have a walled garden like apple where just about any app you can think of is available, but it is quite another to have a walled garden like Amazon where you either have to root or sideload to simply get some basic useful apps.  If the Kindle Fire HDX had google play store, this might have been an entirely different review. :)Two things have stood out as I have delved back into the walled garden that is Apple...One, It may be a walled garden, but it is a gorgeous garden.  The app quality and availability is outstanding. If they allowed Google Play Music I would not have any issues at all with the app store.  I think that the tighter development control that apple institutes on its apps is a double edged sword in some respects but I have not had anywhere near the amount of bugs that I find in the android store apps so in that respect I appreciate that 98.7% of the time when I download an app it just works.  I use it with several google services including chromecast and have been very happy with the results. On a side note, the hardware and build quality is meticulous and the IPad itself is even more impressive after prolonged use, but that has been discussed and beaten like the proverbial dead horse.Two, battery life.  Apple seems to know how to eek out the battery life with more finesse than some competitors.Overall I like the IPad Air much more than I thought I would.  I bought it knowing from a techie nerd stand point what I was giving up with the ecosystem and I have had no regrets at this point.  I can use it for work emails and presentations and come home to play netflix or games with the kids.  An outstanding product that I am sure I will use for the next year or two without issue.And my non-verbal autistic son can run this thing like a beast ;)", "Date": "February 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love the new iPad.

But I do believe it's typically more stable than it's technological counterparts, and easier to use for newbies.  Which is why we bought an IPAD 2 for our 8 yr old a couple years ago.  He took to it right away, it's intuitive enough.  There have been some slight issues, but it's still going strong.  Now 10, we just bought him this IPAD AIR... his 2 yr old brother gets the \"old\" IPAD 2.  And yes, the IPAD is intuitive enough for even a 2 yr old!  The screen on the AIR is so much better, clearer, sharper, and not just because it's \"new\".  Its resolution is just that much better.  Bought a cheap full body case until I could find a better one... trying to decide between the Otterbox (love the protection, not so much the hard cover design and that it doubles as a stand)... the Griffin Survivor (flimsy stand, landscape mode only)... or the Pelican Vault (no integrated screen protector, but I can put a protector on, and it is rated against water splash)... Lifeproof too expensive for what it offers... The 16G in the IPAD 2 was ultimately not enough after a year or so of use... Even with no \"movies\" or \"music\", games are much larger now, a few big games, and there is little left in a 16G device.  Without removing games, we didn't have enough memory left to upgrade the OS... so we opted for 64G this time...

You will more than likely receive an ipad air with scratches, dings, or smudges on the screen or on the back. Right out of the box my ipad had a scratch right above the volume rockers.

This one actually lives up to the hype. It's easy to use, it's reliable so far, and it functions so much smoother and better than anything that is Windows based that I have ever used. After purchasing a tablet that used Windows 8 and going through the usual maze of useless moves and things that didn't work, and then having the unit fail all together in less that 2 months the iPad Air was a welcome change. I definitely recommend the iPad Air.", "Date": "January 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "I like it", "Author": "Bj\u00f6rn Herbert", "ReviewID": "R3EPN5MWYYZ17A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like apple, so I like it!
