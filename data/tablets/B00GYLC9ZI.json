live video benchmark test that the Dragon Touch A97 has about the same scores as an Asus Transformer TF210 and 1st Generation Google Nexus 7, which based on these results is very impressive given the price of the Dragon Touch A97 Tablet.  The Dragon Touch A97 has full access to Google Play and a MicroSD card slot for extra storage.  It will more than suffice for most applications and games and we have extensively compared it to other tablets in it's class and it holds up very well.  Price for performance makes the Dragon Touch A97 an excellent tablet for kids or as a 2nd tablet for the family, though it does lack Bluetooth so you will not be able to pair a Bluetooth keyboard or other Bluetooth device with this tablet.", "Date": "March 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great for the Price", "Author": "GLADYS", "ReviewID": "R2WJCZSNKI8KF0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The tablet is very fast and it works perfectly.

Blackford", "ReviewID": "R28TZR9J7N9M34", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Had some problems with camera app stopping and having to restore system. Finally tracked it down to the \"App Killer\" that is recommended to install to cut back on battery use. It forces the camera and viewing apps to stop. In turn that disables the camera. Also do not let the play store automatically update your apps. Instead check each update to see what access it requires. If you see where it will affect your camera, do not update it. Not sure if that will disable the camera or not but not taking the chance. I use this for e-books, email, browsing, game play, photos, and dozens of other things. Works as expected. The next step up to the quad core tablet would probably do better for a power user if needed. One more complaint, the charger sometimes causes the touchscreen to \"press\" buttons other than the one I actually pressed when plugged in and using. I find that if I \"ground\" a finger or hand on the back of the unit, then this does not happen. I am assuming this is because of the small charger pin not making a tight contact within the pin hole.
