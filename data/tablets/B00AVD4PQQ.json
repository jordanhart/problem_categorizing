The review below applies to this specific model --> Proscan Internet Capacitive Included KeyboardDo not buy this one.  Buy the one linked to above.  It is only $10 more and it is much better.  I have heard that this model does not have access to the Google Play store, and struggles with even playing back a movie.*****  Review for slightly different model of same item, available here: Proscan Internet Capacitive Included Keyboard *****Firstly, let me state that the 5-star rating is comparing this table to OTHERS IN ITS CLASS.  This is not a Nexus, Asus, or Samsung tablet.  It is a bargain tablet in the low end range.I have tried several tablets that are below $100 and they were all virtually unusable, except for this one.  That being said, here are the pros and cons as I see it, including the things that make this tablet difficult for some:Pros:1.  The cheapest tablet available that is actually usable2.  If you get a bad one, Amazon will replace it.  Also most brick and mortar stores let you exchange/return as well3.  Runs Android 4+ so you have access to almost all the latest apps4.  Has the Google Play store among others.  Most cheap tablets lack the Google Play Store which cuts you off from the best apps5.  The included keyboard and case (if you're model comes with it) are really nice and work very well.  What a bargain!  I sometimes use the keyboard/case with my Nexus 76.  HDMI output is available so you can stream movies from the internet or an SD card (or home DLNA server) and watch them on your TV7.  The battery lasts for at least 4 hours of continuous use (haven't tested it too much).  It will go a couple days with light use8.  The expandable storage slots are nice9.  Has a capacitive touch screen so you don't have to push hard to get it to register the touch.Cons:1.  The wireless antenna sucks.  It doesn't have the range that the higher end tablets have.  This means that internet browsing will be a bit slower, and you can't be on the outskirts of the range.  It works consistently though as long as you're close enough to the wireless router.2.  The processor is slow, so it is far from snappy and responsive like a Nexus 7.  However, for less than half the price of the N7 you shouldn't expect it to be comparable.3.  USB charging is not available, so you have to use the included wall adapter.4.  If you want to play games with heavy graphics, the tablet will lag and stutter.  My kids play \"My Play Home\" and other graphical yet non-intensive games all the time without problem.5.  Even when close to a wireless source, the download speeds can be too slow for streaming video over the internet.  The best way to watch video is to put it on the SD card and play it with JoeVLC ([...]) or the built in player.Would definitely buy again, very happy with the tablet for the price.", "Date": "June 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not so good", "Author": "dhicke", "ReviewID": "R3GW6U5TH7DKE5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Looked like an outstanding bargain: an Android tablet with case and keyboard for under $100.
