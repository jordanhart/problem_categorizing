We ordered this one for our 2 year old son and he loves it the only thing is that if the Wi-fi is turned on the battery drains but as long as the apps that you download can work properly with the Wi-fi off its great or if you do not mind charging it everyday. Other than that we love them", "Date": "May 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Kids Disappointed", "Author": "Billetta", "ReviewID": "R13O2M1F4TY2XR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased two of these tablets for my great niece and nephew for christmas.  NEITHER OF THEM WORKED! They wouldn't even take a charge.  Sooooooooooooo disappointing for the kids.  Now I am waiting for their Mom to return them to me so that I may return them back.
