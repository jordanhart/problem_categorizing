Kelleher", "ReviewID": "R2SYRD1UWK1IZR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I received this tablet for a birthday gift and I feel sorry for the person who threw away their money on this tablet.  When I first connected the USB plug in order to charge it, the insides of the USB came out with the charger.  Digital 2 were nice enough to send me a brand new replacement tablet.  However, after 1 month it stopped working and I once again contacted D2.  They sent me 3 links to download in order to reset the tablet, one of the downloads took over 3 hrs.  I couldn't open any of these downloads so D2 told me I have to download a zip program in order to open them (why didn't they tell me this to begin with?).  I followed their instructions but nothing happened.  I am now requesting a return authorization so they can either repair it or send another replacement.", "Date": "March 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not even 1 Star!", "Author": "Emilies Mom", "ReviewID": "RMI2298A2Z529", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Worst tablet EVER. With even worse Customer Service!! Have had tablet for 45days. It has only worked MAYBE 10. Got a replacement Tuesday, it is Thursday evening, and tablet is already broken.

Downloads for apps take a very very long time. Same apps on my kindle fire are less than 5 min and literally hours in this tablet. I am returning and purchasing a kindle for him instead.", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00GGAGQQA"}}
