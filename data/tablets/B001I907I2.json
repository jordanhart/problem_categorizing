{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A Step Closer", "Author": "Craig Whisenhunt", "ReviewID": "R3MU84B6T9NYD7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For anyone out there who is considering whether or not to make the leap and purchase the iPad 2, this review is for you. If you're still debating between the iPad 1 and the iPad 2 check out my review of the first generation iPad right here on Amazon to see a discussion of its strengths and weaknesses with a number of people commenting (both positively and negatively) over the past 11 months.Let me begin by saying this upfront, I don't work for Apple, I don't own Apple Stock, and whether you buy an iPad, Xoom, a laptop or a pad of paper and pencil I don't get anything for writing this. I'm not an Apple \"fanboy\" although I can give credit where credit is due and lately Apple has deserved a lot of credit for some of their products.Physical CharacteristicsThe iPad 2 is absurdly thin. More importantly than it's thinness is its tapered edge which feels more natural in your hand. One of the biggest complaints about the original iPad was it really wasn't tremendously comfortable to hold for long periods at a time. For a tablet device designed to be held, that's a pretty big deal. Apple really has done an amazing job of cramming everything into an even smaller space than before and the difference is really noticeable when you're holding the device. In addition to the tapered edge, Apple managed to reduce the overall weight of the iPad 2. That might not seem like a huge deal to most, especially when you consider the weight difference isn't tremendous when you're already under 2 pounds, but I spend a good part of my day holding the iPad in my hands and the weight difference is surprising by the end of the day. The first generation isn't heavy by any means, but the iPad 2 outshines it.New and \"Improved\"Apple doubled the RAM in the iPad 2 from 256MB to 512MB. What does that mean? For most casual users, probably not a whole lot. There is a performance bump that everyone will see the effects of in things like loading times for webpages that are open in the background, but 256MB was sufficient for most daily use and games. If you're planning to use your device for some of the more graphically intense games the iPad 2 does offer a better method of graphics processing that'll help deliver faster images with fewer jerky movements. If you're just playing Angry birds and reading e-mail you're not going to know the difference.The screen is the same for all real purposes. It is technically a \"new\" part in that it isn't identical to the old, it's a bit thinner and more efficient, but it's the same resolution. The Glass is thinner though, and this amounts to a fair bit of the weight loss from one generation to the next. In playing with the device it seems surprising but despite feeling lighter it actually feels more sturdy in your hands. I still wouldn't suggest dropping it, but if it were to fall the iPad 2 certainly feels like it might stand a better chance to survive. Try not to drop it though.The addition of 2 cameras was expected. Some were a bit surprised to see the first generation released without the cameras. Whether it was for a price point consideration, or a means to get people to upgrade, Apple held off until iPad 2. The cameras do a reasonable job, but they're not going to replace a dedicated digital camera, or really even the camera on your phone for most still images. The cameras do a substantially better job with video, and FaceTime is probably one of the best reasons to get the iPad 2 over the original iPad. For those who might not be familiar, FaceTime is Apple's face to face conferencing system, kind of like Skype, or if you'd rather, kind of like the Jetson's TV/Phone. With the push of a button you can be having a face to face chat with a loved one just about anywhere in the world (provided they're on a wireless network at the time). FaceTime doesn't work over 3G natively (it can be used over a wifi connection created by a 3G device however) so you're not going to be able to use it in your car anytime soon. This is probably a good thing though. It is incredibly easy to use and if you know other people with an iPad 2, iPhone 4, or Mac it's a lot of fun.Smart Covers aren't really \"smart\" but they're really very useful. Not only do they provide a stylistic enhancement of the device, but they serve a practical and functional purpose of doubling as a screen protector and stand in 2 configurations. You can find them in a variety of colors and from third market suppliers, and it's a safe bet that more will be out soon to capitalize on the magnetic sensors in the iPad 2. It's unfortunate that this same feature can't somehow be retrofitted to the iPad 1, I wouldn't have thought a case would be a compelling reason to consider a product over it's competitor, but these covers are really so useful it's hard to understand why they've not been there since the beginning.Multitasking SupportOne of the biggest knocks against the iPad when first released was the lack of native multi-tasking support. Jailbreakers added the feature quickly and Apple soon realized it would be a requirement for any future device's success and released an OS update that included the feature. The iPad 2 capitalizes on that progress and takes it a step further with the increased RAM enabling more open applications to be suspended at once, and the time to open or close an application has improved as well. That said, even the first generation managed to open and close apps faster than most people would be used to on their computers, so while this is an improvement it's more akin to showing off.AppsOne thing that Apple has clearly the advantage in for the moment is app availability. The App store has close to 70,000 iPad specific Apps, all of which will work on the iPad 2. The new cameras will undoubtedly see this list expand rapidly, as will the inclusion of a gyroscope for gaming and motion based uses. There are also a substantial number of professional applications ranging from document creation to photo editing and vector drawing. Chances are if you can dream it, there's an App for that (and if not you might want to get started on one to fill in the gap). The Android market is making a strong showing, and ultimately it'll likely be a strong competitor, for now it still has a ways to go, but any potential buyer should consider the strength of the application market before buying a tablet.Pros:Weight. Seriously. The minimal weight of this thing is by far the most impressive feature about it in my opinion. It seems to defy physics and logic that so much could be in such a small space working that hard for that long.Battery Life. From full to dead my iPad 2 went just over 11 hours with the movie Robin Hood showing twice during that time, the screen at half brightness, wifi turned on, an Angry Birds marathon and a good portion of a book in ibook. That's better than a work day and that's constantly on.Books. This is definitely a Pro, but reading itself could go either way. The great benefit to the iPad is having access to Google Books, ibook, Nook, and Kindle. This allows for some comparison shopping and price competition (although for the most part they're all usually about the same). Reading in the evenings in bed is great as the back light means you don't have to worry about keeping others awake, but the glass screen causes some glare trouble when trying to read outside or near a sunny window. If you're an avid outdoor reader the Kindle might still be your best bet.Cons:Still no dedicated USB support. While there is a camera add-on that allows for certain USB devices to be used there is no option for mass storage. Some of the Android Tablets allow for this and if you find yourself wanting to use your tablet as a standalone storage device this might be something to consider. The device can read from certain flash drives though, but is largely limited to photo and video files. Jailbreaks offer solutions to this, but those come with their own issues as well.Still no dedicated SD card slot. This is troublesome on two fronts. First, if you want to import pictures from your camera you have to have an adapter which is just one more thing to carry around. Second, the lack of expansion means you're limited to what you purchase in terms of storage. I purchased a 32GB iPad last time and never filled it up completely, so for me capacity wasn't an issue. If you want to be able to have your entire movie collection with you though... you may want to consider whether the iPad 2 can meet your space requirements.HDMI output. Really this is a Pro and a Con. The iPad does allow for HD output over HDMI but again it requires an adapter. All of these adapters are additional purchases for features that some tablets offer built in. This can be a pain, but then again if you're not likely to ever use HDMI Output then you're not paying for something you won't use.No Flash Support. This is becoming less and less of an issue as the internet and web developers are moving away from Flash for many websites, but there are a lot still out there relying on Adobe's Flash to run properly (including a lot of web based games). Before you pick a tablet consider what kind of websites you frequent and try and determine if they are Flash driven or not. If they are you may really want to consider something from the Android offerings as it is expected that they'll have at least some Flash support.If you're in the market for a tablet device the iPad 2 should definitely be on your short list. If you're uncertain it is always best to go and play with these things hands on first if you can. Best Buy is a good place for that, so are Verizon Stores since they have the Xoom and 3G iPad. Don't get pulled into the hype and mania that comes with an Apple release. They're exciting and new, and they're impressive enough to warrant some excitement, but it will die down and there will be other products that prove a strong competitor to the iPad 2. If you're looking for right now though, this is probably your best bet. I gave the device 4 stars, as I did the iPad 1. I did this in contemplation of the features offered by competitors that are absent from the iPad, most notably the requirement for adapters for USB/SD/HDMI. While these features are there, they aren't as convenient as in other tablets. With that in mind I firmly believe that the iPad more than makes up for this in usability, reliability, and design and in those areas far exceeds its current competitors.", "Date": "March 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "iPad pros and cons", "Author": "Larry J. Crockett", "ReviewID": "R4VCE1TBRME86", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "People need to be aware that the reviews you see for the iPad often reflect the old Mac/PC platform wars with some people making comments who simply don't like iPads from a distance, without actually owning one, because they see it as part of the deplorable Apple mania they find so distasteful.  They're entitled to their opinion, of course, but it is unfortunate they skew the evaluation of this product without the deep acquaintance one needs in order to give it an insightful evaluation.I have taught computer science at the college level for 26 years and have had computers with all kinds of operating systems. I don't own Apple stock and have never known anyone who works at Apple. I therefore have no connection to Apple.I have had my iPad for about a month and read a fair number of reviews before I purchased, spent some time using one at the store, and thought about what I might use one for, in contrast to my laptop with which I am well satisfied. People too often think of computers in terms of hardware, the specs and looks, instead of the software and the functionality.  You should ask yourself, \"What will I use this for that solves a problem I would like to have solved?\"  Software is always more important than hardware, even though it is the hardware that makes an impression.The iPad is not a laptop and is not principally a production computer, that is, a computer on which you are going to develop web pages, do serious graphics editing, or write a book.  You could use your new Taurus to tow a trailer, but that is not what it is designed to do well. These things can increasingly be done on an iPad, but I don't believe they will ever be what it is best at.  It is a portable media machine with an inviting touch interface that requires a somewhat different set of skills, which take a modest amount of time to learn.  Surfing the web, checking email, watching movies, playing games, looking at new cars, reading the Economist magazine, all work better on an iPad than a laptop.  It does these things very well indeed. There are now 80,000 apps for a wide variety of activities--given its design intent.  The apps are either free or reasonably priced, so you can get a bunch from the \"app store\" for little investment. As with Amazon, you can see what other people think of an app before getting one.This would be a splendid acquisition for small children, for teens deep into social networking, for an adult wanting to drop into the love seat for a quick look at what is happening in the world, for a senior citizen who wants a simple, inviting system with few hassles, to stay in touch with grandchildren.  The iPad is not a light laptop; it is instead a different way to use computing to do a wide variety of consumption and communication--not principally production.In my experience, its wi-fi is adroit from one environment to another.  It \"knows\" where it is geographically, scans its environment for wi-fi, and accesses wi-fi seamlessly.  At this point in time, we should expect no less.  I cannot address the 3G communications since I have a wi-fi only (I am not convinced of the value of the 3G and I can use my phone as a hotspot).  I have never had it crash, though I have had to back myself out of apps that seemed to have no logical next step.  This was the result either of my ignorance or the fact that there is less of a standard user interface from app to app than there is in classical GUIs such as OS X and Windows.For the laptop lugging road-warrior, it should be noted, this is not going to be a full replacement.  I now take my laptop and my iPad when I go into the college.  But much of the time there, I use my iPad because it is so light, convenient and useable. I use it to teach my classes and often reference traditional texts from the iPad instead of lugging them along to class. I develop my own web pages on my 27\" desktop which is the right environment for such development; I wouldn't expect to do that on an iPad.  In education (and evidently in medicine), it is proving to be a real boon.  The enterprise situations where portable information access and transmission are critical will find this a compelling solution.  The heavy Photoshop user or music track editor will still need a conventional computer, either laptop or desktop.I purchased the 64GB version, which may be more storage than I need. But since it will drive my 50\" screen downstairs I figured I would begin to load lots of pictures and favored music, so it may prove a wise choice in the long run.  It can swallow up entire evenings with the music-augmented slide shows it can do. In fact, you may begin to wonder if you need cable TV.  Conventional content providers should be worried about the iPad since it provides yet another way for the user to determine viewing experience. But if you are still drawn to cable, it makes a fine remote control.Before people evaluate this new kind of computing, they need to spend a month or so with it to identify what it does well and what would be better left to other kinds of computing solutions. I fear some of the evaluations here (both glowing and critical) are not well informed and so do not serve the readers well.  So read these reviews with a critical eye.October 18 2011 Update:I continue to find my iPad remarkably productive and productive in ways I would not have anticipated. It does indeed redefine how we can use computing so that it does the work we want to do with minimal impediments.  I now leave my laptop at school and take my iPad back and forth since 80 or 90% of the time the iPad does all I need to do.  I use it 3 or 4 hours a day.I just ordered my wife an 11\" MacBook Air with the larger RAM and storage, which might seem to contradict what I said in my review.  I don't believe it does for the following reasons. She needs to do serious editing of Word documents for the volunteer work she does for the college and still wants the joys of a 2-pound piece of elegant hardware. She is an excellent typist and likes the feel of the Air's keyboard. A keyboard can be added to an iPad, but it's a kludgy add-on that compromises the point of the iPad: an ultra-light slim, touch-interface device that does most of what traditional computing does without the impediments of mouse and keyboard and weight.  The 11\" Air is a gem of engineering with many of the advantages of the iPad but it is more capable of the production I spoke of in my review since it is a full OS X Lion machine--so it is fully capable of running traditional production software such as Word or Photoshop or, for that matter, Windows.The Air and the iPad illustrate the difference between a consumption device (iPad) and a production device (Air).  Much of what is appealing in the iPad can be had in the Air, but at the cost of an additional several hundred dollars. It's not the solution I want since I don't want the keyboard getting in the way when I want to curl up with a consumption device in my favorite love seat or use it to assist my teaching in class.  My wife prefers the Air since email and other typing-intensive production activities are so important to her. In a word, the iPad is distilled essence of computationally assisted consumption.I guess we will give the phrase \"mixed marriage\" new meaning!", "Date": "April 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "It's cool, but has its flaws - and do you really need one?", "Author": "J. Harvey", "ReviewID": "R1YNKZ8Y1IOMEJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First things first: I consider myself relatively unbiased on Apple products. I received the original iPad as a gift (which I was able to return once I saw the iPad 2 announcement) and I have an old iPod 4th gen with color display which is still going strong after a few years, but aside from that I typically use Windows PCs and my phone is Android.If you don't have an iPad, and you're trying to decide whether you want one or not, ask yourself: What will I use this for?This is meant to be an overview for the uninitiated, since according to initial news reports, 70% of people who have bought the iPad 2 so far didn't own an original iPad.Advantages:If you want it for web surfing, a portable Netflix or other video screen, gaming, or FaceTime/Skype video chat, it's definitely adept at all of those things. I used to read books and magazines in my bed before going to sleep, and I still occasionally do, but now I've found that surfing with the iPad is just as convenient and relaxing.The iPad is all about the apps, many of which greatly expand the native capability of the iPad. You can get Microsoft Office clones, remote desktop, second screen, calculators, alarm clocks, remote apps for cable boxes and disc players, and more. Some are free, many are not. I'll get into some of those a bit later, but keep in mind this isn't intended to be a review of apps. If you want to see what's out there, you can search the App store on the web or in iTunes. If you expect the iPad to be able to do something not in its specs, check the app store first.The only difference I've seen with the iPad 2 is that now there are a few games out there that are optimized for iPad 2, or have improved iPad 2 modes. Lots of games are free and those that aren't occasionally go on sale. The only two I've bought are Scrabble HD and Dungeon Hunter 2 HD, both when they were $1 each. (I've played many more free ones.) I recommend both. Dungeon Hunter 2 HD is a great 3D game that tries really hard to be Diablo 2, with character classes, customization, and online play. It looks great and has never crashed or had a framerate stutter. The iPad 1 had problems with crashing and low framerates with games occasionally, and this version seems to be a much better gaming system. That's the only big difference I noticed between the iPad 1 and iPad 2 so far though.For me, having a huge array of apps to play with, many of which are free if you don't mind ads here and there, and the convenience of being able to web surf without having to drag out my laptop makes this worth having. Plus the battery gets 8-10 hours on a charge, which is a far cry better than any laptop I know of. It's a great e-reader for airplane travel, even really long flights, though you can't use it on take-off and landing of course.Wi-Fi performance is flawless and the range is excellent. More than once I've pulled up in the driveway and before I'm even in the house, I've heard my iPad's ESPN ScoreCenter app go off to inform me of a score. I can't speak to the 3G quality, though, as I don't have that model. Frankly, I don't think most people need it. If I'm out of the middle of nowhere and need the web for something, I'd much rather pull out my phone than the iPad. If you just have to use the iPad, tons of public places have Wi-Fi these days.If you want to be able to print things, you might think at first that you need an AirPrint compatible printer. Fear not! A simple Google search for \"AirPrint any printer\" will show you how to configure your PC or Mac to broadcast its printers with AirPrint. I have Brother and Canon printers and they both worked with it. It took some time to download and install the AirPrint service and then configure printer sharing options on my network, but that was a far cry better than buying a new printer or an expensive printing app! Still, I've found that my printers occasionally disappear from the list, and the only way to get them back is to shut the iPad down completely and power it back on. Annoying.Limitations:The iPad 2 still doesn't support Adobe Flash. Some websites are adapting to this and adding HTML 5 video. Many aren't. Keep that in mind if you're a heavy web video user. I love to watch web shows like the Nostalgia Critic and the Angry Video Game Nerd, and most web show hosting sites are still in Flash. Also, some sites have flash menus, making them completely unusable to you if they don't have a mobile version. It's this that prevents the iPad from being a true laptop replacement, regardless of how much you spend on apps. I still end up having to fire up the laptop to use several websites I enjoy.The screen is supposedly oleophobic but gets fingerprints all over the place in mere minutes of use. I find that extremely irritating. If you feel the same way, get a screen protector like the ZAGG InvisibleShield (though if you get that particular one, be VERY careful when you install it, it's extremely difficult to get it on there with no air bubbles). You will thank yourself when all it takes to clear fingerprints is one wipe, plus it protects from scratches to boot. To get fingerprints off the screen itself took vigorous scrubbing and left streaks, which needed isopropyl alcohol to remove. Also, in direct sunlight, the glare off the screen makes it hard to see. Add fingerprints to that and it's practically impossible.Although the iPad 2 has two cameras, one on the front and one on the back, I haven't found much reason to use them other than for video chat. The cameras are terrible quality and the iPad 2 just isn't portable enough to drag around everywhere for camera usage. You can get an excellent digital camera for $150 or less, and most smartphones have much better cameras than the iPad has. Use one of those instead.If you don't own a laptop, don't expect the iPad 2 to do everything a laptop will, especially if you plan on doing any work-related things. Office applications are not included. Pages, Numbers, and Keynote, which are like Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint respectively, are available for $10 each. I don't own them, but apparently they work reasonably well. However they are not 100% compatible with Microsoft Office documents, especially if you have more complicated formatting, macros, or animations that don't translate directly. Plus, the virtual keyboard is a bit more tiring to type on and definitely hinders typing speed. I average about 45-50 WPM on it, where I can get 80-100 WPM on a normal keyboard. You can be a little lazy with it to increase your effective typing speed, though; you can leave out apostrophes or required capitalization and the iPad will nearly always fix it. That also mostly takes care of my fingers occasionally hitting the wrong keys due to the lack of tactile feedback, but I still end up having to go back and fix words sometimes. Also, sometimes it fixes things that don't need to be fixed. It always seems to correct \"its\" to \"it's\", but what if I mean \"its\"? I know the difference!A lot of other features that you would expect a laptop to have are not here, though, or cost more. For example...- You can give slideshow presentations or display video on external monitors, projectors, or TVs with it, but that will cost you $29 for a VGA adapter plus the price of a cable and DVI to VGA adapter (monitors or projectors), or $39 for an HDMI adapter plus the price of an HDMI cable (newer TVs), or $39 for a composite or component video cable (older TVs)- You can transfer photos from a camera directly without having to use iTunes, but that will cost $29 for a camera adapter kit- The iPad is terrible at file storage for things other than music, videos, photos and apps, and with no USB or SD card slot, can't easily use external storage. If you want to store documents or need external storage for anything you'll need a file management app to keep track of them, and an online cloud file storage service like MobileMe (expensive) or Dropbox (free but limited to 2 GB, or pay for more)- Where you can just close a laptop to protect its screen, you'll need a case to protect the iPad. I highly recommend getting one. To save some money, try a cover/case intended for iPad 1, assuming you don't care that the rear camera will be covered up. A lot of them still fit and work great, such as the Griffin Elan Passport for iPad - Black, and since they're for an old model they'll be discounted- You can watch videos/TV episodes/movies on it, but unless you bought them in iTunes, it's a big fat pain to find a converter for them and transfer them to iTunes. This is especially annoying for DVDs/Blu-Rays that have digital copy. You've already paid for the movie and have a digital file but you can't transfer it to your iPad without having to jump through a ton of hoops or buying expensive programs or apps! Not all media companies have this problem, though. When you redeem a digital copy from Disney, you can choose to get an iTunes version, which is perfectly compatible with the iPad. I have Up, Toy Story 3 and Wall-E, and getting them on the iPad was hassle-free. Conversely, Warner Brothers only offers Windows Media versions of the Harry Potter series for digital copy. Transferring to iPad is possible but you need to find programs that remove the DRM, resize to iPad resolution, and convert to Quicktime format. Good luck with that.Despite all that, the iPad 2 is worth getting if you can spare the cash, and more importantly, if you anticipate actually using it. I don't think it's worth getting for games alone, but if you're a gamer, there are lots of great, cheap games out there. Many of them are even multiplayer, though I haven't tried it, since most of my friends don't have iPads and interoperability between iPad and iPhone versions of games is slim to none (board games like Scrabble and Carcassonne tend to support iPad/iPhone interoperability though).The thing is, though, I got this as a gift. Would I have gotten it if I actually had to plunk down the $500+? Honestly, probably not. The lack of many features without having to buy expensive apps and accessories is a real deal-breaker for me (and subtracts a star from my rating). Plus, though I understand why Apple doesn't like Adobe Flash, they really need to get over it since there are large parts of the web that don't work without it. It may be bad for battery life, but why not just have the option to turn it on and off as needed, then? Still, if money is no object for you, it's a slick, entertaining device, and you'll enjoy it quite a bit. Just don't expect it to replace anything you already have; the iPad is in a niche market that the iPad itself created.", "Date": "March 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Comparison of my IPad 2 with my Xoom", "Author": "A", "ReviewID": "R3RXN27YVJW4VK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have purchased both an iPad2 and Xoom for different family members.  I thought it worth comparing the two devices for anyone interested.  Many of my comments are subjective so bear that in mind when reading the review.External appearance and feel:The iPad2 screen has a different feel from the Xoom screen - the iPad2 is a bit slicker, less likely to stick when moving short distances.  The screen on the Xoom tends to show fingerprints more than the Ipad2 for some reason. Everyone in this family thinks that the iPad2 looks sharper than the Xoom.Both weigh 1.6 lbs.  Subjectively, the Xoom feels heavier than the Ipad2, but it's an illusion perhaps caused by it's slightly smaller size.  UPDATE:  I need to learn to use the scales - the Xoom is about 3 ounces heavier than the iPad2.Both have a similar size screen, measured diagonally.  But the aspect ratio is different - 4:3 for iPad2, 16:9 for Xoom.  This means that the iPad2 actually has a larger viewing area, and this makes a real difference when scrolling through a web site.  The iPad2 screen is brighter than the Xoom screen.Hardware performance:The Xoom feels a bit faster than the iPad2, and the specs show that it is faster.  Both have dual core processors based on ARM designs.  The Xoom seems to be able to handle graphics better than the iPad2.  As far as connecting to Wifi networks, both seem to have this one down pat - they both just work.User Interface:The iPad2 is just like a big iPhone.  Whether this good or bad is subjective.  For me, it's good - polished, flexible and can be customized to my needs.  The Xoom user interface is totally new, and unfortunately it shows - there are many rough edges.  Some examples: moving icons around to group programs together is not intuitive and they keep moving back; you can see the first 5 applications running on the Xoom and select one, but the list doesn't scroll so applications that don't show in the list can't be selected; you can't close applications (except by a force quit that can lose data) as the Xoom decides when to quit an application; customization is possible but more difficult than the iPad2.  In short, the Xoom user interface is a work in progress - great potential but currently quite flawed.Operating System:The iPad2 uses Apple's IOS.  It works, but it uses cooperative multitasking which (in theory) is less effective than the full multitasking on the Xoom which uses a version of Google's Android designed for tablets.  In practice, they both work fine and I doubt anyone would notice the difference.Applications:iPad2 has 70,000 apps available from the Apple App store and it also runs the 300,000 apps available for the iPhone.  Xoom currently has around 60 apps and it can run Android phone apps (but they are stretched in one direction which makes them look strange).  Some of the iPad2 applications are pretty impressive - GarageBand for example.  There are many games on the iPad2, and just a few games made for the Xoom.  If this doesn't improve quickly, the Xoom is sunk.  After all, applications are generally the reason people buy these devices.Browsing:Because of the screen aspect ratio that I mentioned, I prefer browsing on the iPad2.  The Xoom has Adobe Flash and the iPad2 doesn't, but so far I haven't come across a single instance where this has been an issue.  I'm sure there are very many sites not compatible with iPad2, but I haven't browsed to one of them yet.Camera:I don't use the camera much, and I'm not really sure if either is better.  In the family, the Xoom owner says the Xoom is better, the iPad2 owner says the iPad2.  The Xoom has flash and iPad2 doesn't which is a win for Xoom, but the Xoom seems slower to take a picture.Speakers:The Xoom has two small speakers, iPad2 has one slightly larger speaker.  The sound is somewhat better quality on the iPad2 and the Xoom cannot achieve the same volume as the iPad2.  But they are both pretty poor - use earphones or an external speaker if you want decent audio.Battery life:Difficult for me to give an exact comparison, but based on family usage it seems the iPad2 has the edge here, but not by much.Internal storage:The Xoom has 1GB of RAM and 32 GB of flash storage.  The iPad2 has 512MB of RAM and 16GB, 32GB or 64GB of flash storage - I bought the 64GB model.External storage:The Xoom has an external card slot that supports SD cards, but the software was not ready in time for the product release.  The slot is inoperative until Motorola releases an operating system update.  The iPad2 has no external storage support.User Experience:The iPad2 was up and running quite quickly.  I connected the device to iTunes and it automatically updated to the latest version of the operating system.  I was then able to select and download Apps immediately and start using them.The Xoom was not so easy.  For some reason, I was not able to install the latest version of Google Maps or Adobe Flash.  I was able to download the apps, and the install process appeared to work without errors, but the new apps just were not installed.  After some time trying I finally returned the Xoom back to the factory settings and started again, and this time both the installs worked.  Of course, this wouldn't be a good solution if you had a ton of applications and/or data on the device.Support:Apple has their retail stores.  You can get a huge amount of help from these stores from people whose only job is to support users.  Both iPad2 and Xoom users have web sites available that support their products but you have to spend the time digging for the sites and digging through the sites.  You can also purchase an Applecare support package which gives you a couple of years extra support for the iPad2.Bottom line:I believe the Xoom hardware may be slightly better than the iPad2 (apart from the screen aspect ratio and the speakers), but the software is terribly lacking.  The Xoom was released FAR too early, it's just not ready for primetime.If I had to pick just one, I'd pick the iPad2 - less hassle, apps for everything, better browsing experience, better support options.  The Xoom needs less buggy software and more applications; it has potential but it's not there yet.  And by the time it gets there, there will be something better available.Update 7/5/2011We have now had the two devices for over 3 months.  During that time Motorola released an update to fix some of the issues with the original Xoom.  It's somewhat faster, the problem of only seeing the first 5 applications is fixed, there are some extra capabilities for USB, and most importantly, the Xoom doesn't crash every few hours.However, the biggest issue with the Xoom is still the number of applications available to run in native tablet mode, as opposed to running Android phone applications.  I've read that there are 300 applications available, but it's hard to find them.  The Android Market doesn't distinguish between phone applications designed for a small screen  and tablet applications.  You have to read the description of each application to see what it is designed to run on, and finding 300 apps in 200,000 is very time consuming.  Apple claims to have 100,000 iPad specific apps in their store.Another problem with the Android Market is the complete lack of supervision.  I understand that anybody can put any application there without any review, and I've read there have been a few problems with malware.  Recently I saw an article that claimed there are spyware applications on the store, which worries me a little.  I'm not saying you can't get malware from the Apple store, but Apple does look at the apps first - I'm not aware of any malware getting into the Apple store.The iPad2 does have some downsides I wasn't aware of when I wrote my review.  It would be nice to have a general purpose USB connection and a card slot.  There is an extra-cost adapter available from Apple that supplies HDMI out and a limited function USB connector.  Also the keyboard attachment made for the original iPad doesn't work on the iPad2.For us, the iPad2 is the winner.  The Xoom is sitting on a shelf and I don't think it's been used over a week now.  In contrast, iPad2 is in use every day and continues to be a big hit.  The primary problem with the Xoom is the lack of tablet-based applications.Update 7/7/2011The Xoom has been sold to a colleague who wants an Android tablet.  I think the Xoom is better than most of the Android tablets currently available.  However, the Honeycomb software feels so unfinished, and the paucity of available tablet-based applications was a major issue.  I lost several hundred dollars on the sale, but nobody wanted to use it and there was no point in letting it lay around unused.  I'm already under some pressure to buy another iPad2, but I want to wait to see if the rumors of another iPad version in September are true.", "Date": "April 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Went from \"why do I need it\" to \"Can't live without it\"", "Author": "C. A. Sinclair \"doctorcreation\"", "ReviewID": "R1FENBQH0LHSET", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "SUMMARY: White iPad 2 64GB Wifi-onlyA really wonderful electronic device for media consumption with some moderate content creation potential. This will likely change as more apps focused on content generation are created.  I find myself using it more and more simply because it is \"always ready\" and small enough that it is always near. If this device had a better file management system and a more robust way to share printers it would have gotten 5 out of 5 stars. As it is, the iPad 2 is a solid 4 star device.DELIGHTERS (Current features that exceeded my expectations)FORM FACTOR: Thin and comfortable to hold. Small enough to toss in a bag or carry around the house so you find yourself using rather than trying to \"remember\" to do \"that thing\" the next time you're at your computer. Still has some weight to it (1.3lb) so prolonged reading in certain positions will cause fatigue.APP ENVIRONMENT: Really excellent variety and quality of applications for a broad range of uses and a broad range of prices. Also plays nice with content providers like amazon kindle, Google docs, and lots of news outlets.SLEEP MODE: It is seemingly \"always ready\" as it wakes from sleep very quickly.HDMI OUT: Granted there is a $40 accessory required it is nice to have the option of showing what's on your iPad 2 to a larger audience.iOS: Overall the operating system is \"cleanly\" designed, features are easy to navigate and find.PROCESSING SPEED: Remarkably quick to load apps, web pages, pdfs, etc.SATISFIERS (Current features that met my expectation)HOMESHARING: Being able to share my iTunes library (music, movies, podcast, etc)  across my wifi network is wonderful and saves space on the iPad 2.SCREEN: Bright, good touch sensitivity, \"flips\" between orientations well, handles pictures and text with aplomb.PRICE: Reasonable considering the competition but nearly high enough to justify a \"real\" laptopAUDIO: Speaker is quite good for a handheld device, placement in portrait mode ends up in your lap but you can invert the iPad so not a huge deal. Also speaker faces rear of device instead of forward meaning you need to crank it louder than maybe otherwise necessary if it were forward facing.BATTERY LIFE: Battery holds up well even after a day of heavy usage, charges up easily over night. Can go 2-3 days without charging with moderate to light usage)WIFI: This simply \"works\". turn it on, detect a signal, and go. No messing around with complicated network settings.ONSCREEN KEYBOARD: Its responsive and surprisingly easy to use. However, scrolling to a separate numbers keyboard and lack of a \"tab\" button really disrupts workflow.DISSATISFIERS (Current features that did not meet my expectations)FILE MANAGEMENT: File management on the iPad is Byzantine. You use iTunes to \"attach\" files to apps or email them?PRINTING: Unless you have an AirPrint capable printer (new hardware to buy) or one of a handful other printers you will need to use the atrocious \"file management\" system above to get the docs on you computer to print. Double whammy of pain!CAMERAS: The two cameras are adequate for video chatting but taking stills is a joke. True I wouldn't want to shoot a lot of birthdays holding an iPad but I would like to use a program like \"GeniusScan\" to photograph documents for later reference. The 0.7Megapixel camera is capable of \"barely legible\" documents.COST PER GB: Paying >$3 per GB ($100 more for 64GB than 32GB) is nearly twice what you'd pay per GB for the difference in a stand-alone USB thumbdrive.TOUCH NAVIGATION: Ok so this is a general criticism of any touch device and there is no way to get around it really. Having \"grown up\" using keyboards and mice to interface with computers I am having to learn how to do tasks differently. Press-Hold, Swipe, Two vs Three fingers. All for tasks I was so used to doing with a Tab or Right-click.WISHLIST (features I'd like to see in the next-gen iPad)Touchscreen: The capacitive screen works fine for many things but writing notes with a \"fat\" stylus isn't one of them. Having a touch screen that doesn't require the \"fat\" stylus would greatly improve handwriting and note taking.USB or SD Card ports (never gonna happen as Apple uses memory as a price differentiator but it doesn't hurt to dream)Retina displayInfrared receiver/transmitter (Can anyone say universal remote!)GPSCheaper 3G antenna: $130 bucks extra for a 3G receiver plus I gotta buy a plan? ugh.Smartcover: Would like to see this included in the price of the device", "Date": "April 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "A few things that haven't been covered...", "Author": "Expert Reviewer", "ReviewID": "R1HDDISACYGGRC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're considering a tablet, the only rational choice is the iPad 1 or the iPad 2. Anything else you there is too expensive/too buggy/lacking support/etc. As someone who owns a desktop but no laptop, the iPad 2 is just perfect. A laptop would often be redundant, though it would be handy for working outside of the home.  With the iPad, I will use it all the time both in the home and elsewhere.I will try to add some comments that haven't been covered:* I find that 16gb is fine, though this may change if app sizes get much larger. I don't intend to store my music or a bunch of videos on this. Videos can be streamed, or added as-needed, and I rely on DropBox to store files - it lets me view and edit files between my desktop and my iPad.* Part of the reason the iPad is perfect for travel is that you can use it in any position, unlike a laptop, where you have to find a seat.* It won't ever got hot or overheat. Personally, I've had a couple laptops expire on me due to overheating. You always have to keep them on a firm surface so you don't block the vents. The iPad doesn't have these problems (I think that the Macbook Airs similarly will never overheat). You no longer have to grab a tray or giant book to set your laptop on when using it in bed.* Terrific value. All hype aside, the design, durability and capability of an iPad 2 is such that I would expect to pay much more. You can find a cheap laptop for the same price, and it will be capable of much more. However, the iPad will accomplish 95% of what you want to do on a computer, and will open doors (via apps) to new and totally unexpected experiences.* Browsing the web is better on the iPad. At least, it often is. It's certainly better to take your iPad on the couch than to hunch over a laptop on the coffee table. Though the screen is small compared to a desktop screen, it's equivalent to working on a bigger screen because of how close you will be. Scrolling and navigating a webpage with your hand is a qualitatively better experience than using the tools we've become accustomed to (mouse, trackball or trackpad). I guess that's why sci-fi movies always depict computers with touch interfaces in the future. Moving the page around and adjusting the size of everything by hand never gets old.* Just like with my iPhone 4, I rarely sync my iPad 2. I'm not a huge fan of iTunes. I can sync occasionally to back-up my apps. I don't use iTunes to manage files (again, I rely on Dropbox). Dropbox and Evernote are must-have apps on all my computers and portable devices.* Safari can use some work. I prefer the tabbed browsing, not having to switch windows. There are some alternative browsers (I bought 360 Browser, which is good), but Apple won't let me select those as my default browser. I don't use Safari on my desktop, but even if I wanted to sync my passwords and history, I don't think it'll let me (it will sync bookmarks through iTunes though). I really wish Apple would loosen up so that Firefox or Chrome would be available, and that one of those could be my default.* As cool as the smart cover is, I spent my money on a wireless keyboard instead. I really don't think the smart cover is going to make a difference as long as I take other measures to protect my screen. I may skip the HDMI adapter as well - it would be fun, but there is never a time that I will need to project my iPad on my HDTV.In summary, if you think you'd like it, you'll probably love it. If you are just kinda curious but content with your current set-up, you can save yourself the money. For the same price, you can get an adequate laptop running Windows 7. I think this is a great alternative though.", "Date": "March 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "honeymoon is over", "Author": "bkluvr", "ReviewID": "R35YBRP4F9OZZ8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "i bought this from apple because amazon didn't have it yet.  I am middle- aged, love my nano, a kindle devotee from the first days, don't have a smart phone, and am a pc user.  at first i was awed by the touchscreen and the resolution quality.  images are gorgeous.  but now, it is really annoying.  too often the screen doesn't respond, and then reacts when you don't even know you're touching it.  the word processing function has been limited and limiting from the start, for someone accustomed to microsoft.if you think in buying the ipad you are getting a  compact, fast, light computer, you are not.  it IS fast.  a computer it is not.  no flash player is definitely a hinderance.  what it is great for is apps, games, (although the screen has been frustrating there too), watching movies and tv shows,  some browsing on the internet, and as a portable photo album, because images are truly fantastic on the ipad.  i find the screen very fatiguing on my eyes, and have the brightness level down almost as far as it can go.  i would never dream of reading a book on it.  kindle has nothing to worry about, as far as the ipad as a reading device.  the fact i can't see the ipad  screen outside, even in the shade, is also unfortunate, but i get it, that's a backlit screen.i am submitting this review not to bash apple, but to clarify a bit to people not familiar with macs and/or touchscreens what this device is about.  would i buy this device again? not unless it sold for maybe $300.  it is more a toy than a tool.", "Date": "August 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "ANYONE OF ANY AGE CAN USE IT.", "Author": "carol irvin \"carol irvin\"", "ReviewID": "RFX4JZ7CUL8NY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The biggest change in our lives so far with the arrival of our iPad 2 is now that we have three of them, no one is without an ipad 24/7.  You wouldn't think this would be a big deal but it is.  It has eliminated all discord here plus the place is quiet as a tomb most of the time as each person is curled up with his own ipad. We are a husband and wife in our 60s plus my husband's mother who is 100 years old. She is curled up with the iPad almost all day long as her ability to do anything active has all but vanished. She goes easily  from reading a Danielle Steele ebook to watching a Prince William and Kate lifetime movie.The above is both versions of the iPad's biggest virtue: ANYONE OF ANY AGE CAN USE IT.  Both my husband and I are techie types so we are quite expert on computers.  Friends in our age range usually are not.  My advice to every one of them is \"buy an ipad.\"  It puts those with low tech abilities on an even playing field because they do everything with their fingers and visually.  It is the supreme compliment to say about either iPad, \"any idiot can use it.\"Right now you can't buy an iPad 1.  We were going to buy a third one of those on sale but they sold out so fast that we had to get the iPad 2 as our third one.  My husband is the one who appreciates subtle refinements in electronics.  He has been in seventh heaven since it arrived.  Truthfully, my mother in law and I, as long as we can get on it and read our books, watch our movies, assemble recipes in our app cookbook, and so forth and so on, are happy as can be and both iPad versions do that extremely well.  My husband is the one who waxes rhapsodically over lighter weight, better LED screen, improved battery life, and so forth.  Like most reviewers of iPad 2 he concludes that it is a beautiful evolution but not a revolution from the first iPad.For those of you with extended families elsewhere, there are other new features which could be huge features for you.  The ability now to visit with family members by video with your ipad 2 are completely built in.  It has two way cameras. I would like to talk our other family members in California into getting one for the benefit of my mother-in-law, who could have excellent \"visits\" by iPad with all of them.Also if you want to stream what is on your ipad directly to your HDTV and projectors, that too is now built in. We don't have such a tv because we like watching directly on the iPad itself with earphones.There is also the ability to not only take your own videos but to edit them online. Plus the ability to locate your ipad if it is lost and to wipe its contents remotely.These above new features are opening up a lot of possibilities for educators as well.  Apple maintains an entire subsection on its website to helping educators use the new features to iPad 2 to best advantage.  Essentially, it wants to enable them to use the iPad 2 to put its content onto a screen immediately in front of their students with the teacher controlling the whole thing with his or her fingers.  Go over to Apple to check this all out as it is incredible.I absolutely love the camera on the iPad 2.  There was no camera on the iPad 1.  Much as I have always loved my iPhone's camera, and much as I complained about who would want to use a camera the size of the iPad 2, I admit I underestimated it.  It is just a fabulous camera and with just pointing and shooting you take pictures that look as if a professional had taken them.I also researched this cover that apple was pushing real hard.  It looks great but i discovered the users were not happy with it.  Turns out they have to clean their screens every time they use it because it leaves three big marks on the glass every time.  They also said it was unstable as a stand and one guy smashed his ipad on the floor as a result, shattering it.  Apple is not very good at these accessory devices.  So we ordered the zoogue ipad 2 case and are very happy with it. We have zoogues on our other two ipads as well and are totally happy with them.

Lleras", "ReviewID": "R3SEXRV40Z31JD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The iPad is an invaluable travel companion if you are a frequent travelet.Why do I preffer black vs white? If what you mostly do is watch videos on your iPad you want it with the black bezel because the video will blend with the black bezel and look larger than with the white it becomes kind of a distraction, this is the reason why most TV's in the market have a dark or a black bezel.Portability of this thing is amazing, Its light and its easy to lug around when you are traveling. Also the battery life is exceptional, I'm bad at keeping my devices charged up and I have done a couple of 8 hour trips and my ipad was stil kicking when I landed and a few days after, Im truely surprized.For those of you debating between the 3GAT&T;, 3GVerison or the Wifi version, it depends on where you go to. I had the original 32 wifi only and I was very happy with it I noticed I got Wi-Fi access at a lot of places and I could also use the wifi hot spot on my phone to connect however, in recent travels I have been sent to middle of nowhere america where AT&T; has no 3G coverage and hotels have no wifi (yes they are out there, hotels that still have no wifi) after I returned from my last trip to said location I decided I should get the Verizon iPad simply from the coverage perspective and since the 3G service is not on contract and the Verizon plans have more options I decided that was my choice. Now is this the best option for everyone, no! I think the 3G is just for a small amount of users the vast majority should be fine with a 16GB or a 32GB, if you know your way around the app market place and apps like Air Video Server and tools like DVD Fab and TVersity you dont need that much storage space on your iPad you can simply stream everything. Besides, I have a 32GB and I have 57 videos loaded in that 32GB iPad which if I watch 10-12 on a trip it is an overstatement, I'll watch a few on the plane but the rest, Im streaming from my Media Center at home or from NetFlix. When talking to people in line I was shocked at the number of people looking for the Verizon version when they do not travel, people if you are home most of the time just use your wifi, its cheaper and its faster! Another thing to note is that if you are an international traveller and want 3G the Verizon iPad is NOT Global wireless (so no 3G anywhere outside of the US) however wifi will work just fine.You will see people complain about resolution and such and honestly, I think the resolution is perfect, the iPad is not meant to replace your laptop or your desktop or your TV, if it was why they would have bothered with airplay? If you are expecting to dump your laptop because you got an iPad think again, if you just use your laptop for browsing pages and playing games then you might get away with it however if you expect to do Office on these, think again, until MS gets their act together and decides that IOS is another venue of revenue for them I will still need to carry my laptop around to do word/excel/ppt files. Lack of flash support has not bothered me, yes I wish I could see some pages however, Im not in to the too flashy stuff (no pun intended) I rather get the straight text and keep going my only gripe would be that when Im conected via WiFi I would like to get full pages and not the mobile version however that is not an iPad problem it is a server problem.Overall my score goes as followsComfort and portability A+Battery Life A+App Diversity and usability A+Interface A+Expandibility C (I dont need a USB port or anything like that however it is annoying that if I ever needed and expansion either I have to pay for an adapter or its not available)TV Out Support B+ (simply judging that for HDMI you have to buy the dongle)Cammera Quality C (who needs a cammera in their iPad anyways? Face time sure, rear facing meh)Other thoughts:Get a screen protector, I tried the Invisible Shield for my Gen 1 and hated it, the material removes the slickness of the screen and makes it harder to interact. I like the Splash screen protector, it is like its not there and it does make cleaning a bit easier.Get a case this thing is beautiful but if you would like to maintain its resale value get a case that cover both front or back or separate covers, I think the Vapor case hack is pretty interesting.Investigate tools like DVD Fab Video Converter (excellent for making iPad versions of your DVD's and BD's and it does take care of EVERYTHING for you from conversion to the right format to importing to iTunes) TVersity and Air Video for content streaming.Be realistic on your expectations, I know Apple calls their products magic and their user interface and experience is fenomenal however there are limitations as to what these things can do so try to make an informed purchase that you are happy with instead of rushing and then having something that doesnt meet your expectations.

So, here is the \"Dummies Guide to the iPad\" to help you make that decision.\"I promise to keep the jargon down to a bare minimum\" :To begin with the iPad must be paired to an existing Laptop or Desktop PC. These can be normal Microsoft Windows or Mac PC's. Once paired you can use the iPad by itself. It only has to be paired once. Although, there is a rumour that the next generation will work straight out of the box.You will be able to:-Touch and pinch the screen to type words and move things around-Send and Receive Emails-Browse the Internet including Online Banking, Internet Shopping and more...-Listen to Music, including the Radio when there is a Wireless (Wi-Fi) connection-Watch Videos and Movies-Write and Print Letters (see the section on 'Printing' further down)-Download and Play Games-Become a Smarter Person (more on this later)-Display Pictures - it is an electronic Picture Frame too!-Take Pictures and Movies, if it has the onboard camera (iPad2 and newer)-Have a chat with the relatives abroad using Video Conferencing technology-Download THOUSANDS of books into a snazzy Book Reader that you can actually turn pages on the screen with-There are loads more - I'll leave them as a surprise if you decide to buy one :)You will NOT be able to:-Watch a special type of animation or movie using a technology known as 'Flash' - don't worry about this though, you'll hear lots of people complaining about it. It really is no big deal and you'll learn to live without it. Over time, many of the popular web sites will move away from using Flash and use a newer technology that DOES work on iPads.-Insert a CD (there is no slot and you don't actually need one)-In fact, there is not much else you can't do with an iPad :THE WIZARDSNo, not the ones' from Oz! Wizards are helpful programs that magically pop up and automatically configure things like the Internet and Email connections for you. The iPad has more Wizards than you can wave a wand at! When you first switch it on and whenever you need to set something up it will automatically present you with a Wizard. Therefore setting things up is as easy as 1-2-3.The iPad is also an iPod!! - Loading music is done in one of two ways.1 - install the free version of iTunes onto your normal PC and follow the Wizards instructions to download your music from the 'iTunes Store' or transfer your music from your favourite CD collection. Then, connect the iPad to your computer using the supplied cable and it will automatically 'Synchronise' your music to the iPad. Yup, you guessed it - using yet another Wizard!2 - iTunes is a built in application (or App) on the iPad itself. Tap this App to search for and download your music directly to the iPad. You could even download a movie or your favourite episode of 24 too!Once the music is on there just tap the iPod App to listen to it. Easy-Peasy!APPSThe iPad extensively uses Apps. Apps are downloaded, using Wi-Fi. This is why you don't need a CD drive. These are the icons that are displayed on the screen.Apps are downloaded from the Internet using yet another App called: \"The App Store\". Tap this icon to search for or see a list of the most popular Apps available, some are paid for and some are free! Tap the 'Install' button next to the one you'd like, follow the Wizards instructions and the App will automatically download and appear as a new icon on the screen.LOADING PICTURESThese can be loaded onto the iPad using iTunes, Email or the 'Camera Connection Kit' - this is a separate adaptor ($30) that plugs into the bottom of the iPad. Just insert the memory card from your camera into the adaptor and it will automatically load the pictures into the built in Photo App.THE PICTURE FRAMEWhen the iPad is locked (by pressing the button on the top-right side) and then back on again, you'll see a little icon in the lower right side corner of the display. Tap this and the Photo App will automatically display your pictures in full screen mode, converting the iPad into a digital Photo frame! It is a great feature. This means that you can leave the ipad on the shelf, literally as part of your rooms decor! You may want to purchase a 'Dock ($30)' to have the iPad tilted and supported at just the right angle.Tip: if you need a reason to justify buying an iPad to your wife - use the Picture Frame one!!PRINTINGPrinting is done wirelessly, however you MUST use one of the wireless printers detailed on the apple.com website. Typically, it will not print to anything other than one of those printers. There is one caveat to this statement, it is possible to print to any wireless printer if you pay for and download a third party App that is available via the App Store - use the search keywords 'wireless printing' to find it.It is also possible to email whatever you'd like to print and pick it up on your normal PC for printing.Finally, I mentioned that you could become a Smarter Person by using an iPad - in fact this is not a joke. There are thousands of educational Apps including ones' for learning Astronomy through to learning how to read and play music and even Apps that will help you learn a new language. The possibilities are literally right at your finger tips!!If you're unsure of which size to buy just buy the largest one you can afford. I have a 32GB version and have only used half of its capacity even with some very large Apps installed.The iPad is many things to many people and the information above is just scratching the surface.\"I hope this review helps you make the right decision and I also hope that I did not use too much confusing jargon.\"Good luck!*** update 12th October 2011 ***Apple have released their new Operating System (iOS 5)Amongst many new and enhanced features there is now the ability to synchronise data across multiple Devices. They call it 'iCloud' - think of iCloud as 'Virtual Filing Cabinet' to store your Documents, Diary and a record of your downloaded media from iTunes.

At work I wanted to stop printing the powerpoint decks and reports to read, and just read them on an iPad in meetings/on the go. For home I was tired of not being able to get to all my magazines and never having them on me when I wanted to read them. I also wanted to watch some TV/movies in bed/around the home so that I did not have to switch on the big living room TV. The iPad 2 has been a perfect solution for all these and more. I'm kicking myself that I went with the lowest 16GB version as I find myself downloading more content and apps everyday! It's not a laptop/desktop replacement either at home or work, but it's a great media consumption device and more.I already used my iPhone 4 constantly due to the multitude of apps and games available for it. Fewer apps are available for iPad but it's still thousands, and I have already downloaded 200+ to try, most of them free.The hardware itself is very slick. Very light so you can hold it in one hand, especially if you use a cover - otherwise it tends to be slippery. But it's not so much about the hardware, which other reviews have detailed anyway. It's all about being able to do what you want to do with a device. With the best technology the device itself should disappear and allow you to create, read, connect - whatever it is you want to do. That's what iPad 2 is doing for me, like a netbook never could. Using it is so intuitive and seamless, that despite having the iPhone 4, I am amazed with how much more I can do to be productive. I regret not buying it sooner!Like the previous devices Apple has created the genius is in the apps available for it. The PressReader apps allows me to read newspapers and magazines from all over the world. I can now read some favorite magazines that were so difficult to get in the print version and newspapers too. Apps like the Flipboard and Zite make magazine content come alive. Favorite magazines like Bloomberg Businessweek and Wired are available free as iPad versions to print subscribers. Also, all news magazines are now featuring interactive content, so I'm reading the news article and looking at static images, and then just as easily click on a video to watch it. The Daily is a good interactive made for newspaper but I'm looking for even better interactive journalism!\"The Civil War\" shows us what history books of future should look like with its interactive content and a daily log of events as they happened 150 years ago. Netflix streams nicely and I can watch the content I want to that bore my family to tears - like documentaries. I also download all my PDF reading materials on it and can read and annotate and highlight. Powerpoints are so easy to read and I can scale the screen to look at the graphs better. iMovie is so simple to use, and I've already created several home movies with music and subtitles. GarageBand is great for novices like me, it has a multitude of instruments that I can play and even has smart versions to create music. With penultimate and UPad I've been trying to completely do away with paper notepads, but that's not the perfect solution yet.With apps like Dropbox and Box you can drop your files into the cloud and access them from your iPad. Chatting over FaceTime or over Webex is simple, although it's entirely dependent on bandwidth. With other apps you can access your remote desktop and use every program on your computer or pull any file. I am using TeamViewer which is free for individuals to log into my home PC from work and check my files or run some programs remotely. It shows you your PC screen on your iPad and you drag your finger to move the mouse cursor and click. It's pretty seamless once you set it up, as simple as opening the app. I opened it one day from work to see my kid watching Youtube and surprised her at dinner when she told me she had been doing home work (ha!).Another made for iPad app I use a lot is the Tivo Remote. When I turn it on it automatically shows the program I'm currently watching on the iPad screen with more details and upcoming episodes. I can use the remote buttons or explore like programs, set my season passes, etc. And when I'm not home I can use it to record programs remotely. Xfinity from Comcast also allows you to schedule and watch your onDemand content. HBO GO is simply a delight, I am thrilled to have all the HBO shows available to me anywhere I go!I have been reading much more since I got iPad 2. Especially blogs, magazines and newspapers. That alone makes it worth it for me. And it's SO much easier to stream content like TED Talks, Lectures from YouTube, movies from Crackle and Netflix. I would have never wanted to sit down with my heavy and hot laptop for such prolonged periods to watch this content. There are some fun games available too, and every day more apps get launched which make me wonder how did I manage without this before!Facetime has been fun too. There are Qik (from Skype) and Tango, and several other apps available that will let you do video chat but since Facetime is integrated with email, you can just click on a contact's name and choose to connect through FaceTime. I can not only check on my kid on video through this feature (all they need is an iPod Touch and wireless) but also connect with friends overseas for free. And I can click their pics while they're on the call with me. Again this feature is dependent on video quality but as a multi-tasking mom it's been great to be able to connect any time in video from work to home. My kid will be listening to music on her iPod Touch and my FaceTime call comes in - and we're off talking face to face. VLC Player has been a great app to watch .avi and other videos. I had slightly lower res version of a TV series in AVI format and the VLC player allowed me to watch it on iPad, I prefer that screen to my HP Pavilion 17 inch which has worse resolution and tends to get too hot in my lap anywayBattery life was a big surprise for me. Mine lasts 10-11 hours on the WiFi model with full usage. That is amazing, I never carry the charger as it goes 2 days without charging. Love it! None of my laptops can compare!The frustrations I experienced with the iPad 2 was its inability to play Flash, which will not come any time soon due to Steve Job's dislike of that technology. However, a genius of an app called iSwifter has found a way to run flash on iPad 2 and I have been using it to watch video on websites that have flash content. However, it's still not as seamless as I would like it to be! The other is a more seamless way to store and organize photos and files. I can do this through apps but why not make this more seamless. If I have to delete photos there should be a select all feature to delete a whole folder.If you're on the fence about buying an iPad 2 go ahead and make the leap, you won't regret it. If you already have an iPad then hold on for iPad 3 as this version gives you some enhancements (faster, improved graphics, thinner, cameras) but nothing that is so extraordinary that you can't wait another few months!", "Date": "April 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "I PAD 2 Initial Thoughts", "Author": "DGK", "ReviewID": "R63GIOHEGF2ME", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So I'm in the kitchen, listening to my music library, and typing a review for the I-Pad 2. I have put a little more than 14 hours of research and 6 hours of non-stop use. I'm not gonna waste my time writing the specs for this device because if you are reading this I assume you already know the specifications, if not you can easily access the Apple website and do your own research. This review is aimed more towards the educated consumer. A consumer, who like me, has spent various hours of the night researching and contemplating his or her next moves.First, I want to start off with the word \"tablet\", what is a tablet and who needs it? As an avid P.C. user, I tend to define the device as too short, too little. A underpowered, pre-mature device not ready for this day and age. The truth is, their are more people out there who need a tablet versus a laptop. Having a quad core, overclocked, power hungry P.C. I am like most other users; who tend to have a bias when selecting/comparing  portable products. I have been for some time; looking for a laptop with great battery life, portability and power? I first went out and purchased a Macbook pro for about $1199+ some. After a couple weeks of use I was in love. I could not stop showing it off and playing with it. Then I attempted to play games and yes they were playable! But I found myself running to my P.C. whenever I was gonna get serious and then I found myself using my desktop when editing videos. Yet again, I found myself running to my P.C. when it came to doing anything that involved time and effort... It was at this point that I realized that I never used my laptop for more than a hour. Utilizing a mere 20-40% of its power. I used it for; writing papers, showing off pictures and Internet browsing. So I decided to return it. In search for something that made sense.I never considered a net-book useful or even worthy of my time, even less a tablet. The Motorola Xoom came out and I thought it had potential compared to last years 256MB I-Pad. It offers 1GB of internal memory and 32GB of storage space, all for $599. It not only had the potential, but also the power I craved. Although, its pre-mature operating system was a deterrence. This is the same thing that turned me away from the original IPad. Dispite the fact that I liked the original, if people didn't demand it, the product would die and I would be left with a 500 dollar piece of silicon or waste. I needed something portable and practical. I just felt the tablet was a little more practical, if not more useful too because of its  portability and extended battery life. So I took the plunge and got the Ipad 2.First impressions didn't fall short; it was easy to set up, had a beautiful screen, and gorgeous aesthetics. While Apple boasts about its 60,000 app's, I'll tell you what, it's not enough (way better than android though). While you can download IPhone and ITouch apps; they are simply not the same (a 3.5inch app on a 9inch screen). Face Time also seems to be problem, since it cost money for all your friends who don't have an IPad 2 or new Macbook. Tango or Skype are excellent alternatives, but still only supported in a 3.5 inch window. Despite this, it has some killer apps (e.g gmail, calendar syncing, web browsing and etc). My favorite app is TeamViewer, which gives you remote access to your PC from anywhere. This app is simply amazing. I was able to install some programs to my PC from school! While It doesn't support flash, it plays almost every video stream I've seen from the web. Hey, that's all I needed anyways. So I can't complain, but all you flash gamers might.Now I found this whole \"touch-typing\" thing to be an exasperation. Since I am primarily using this product for note taking, its important I am as accurate as possible. Keys kept skipping and words kept missing. So I upgraded to the Apple-wireless-keyboard.. sigh. It was a well spent 69.00 dollars (cheaper models are available). I am able to control volume, brightness and music. Also makes my tablet feel more like a high end net-book. I want to talk a little bit more about writing. I bought this tablet with the intention of using google docs. Well it works, but you have use the mobile version, which has limited functionality. I tried switching to desktop editing, but it was horrendously slow and unworkable. As a matter of fact I'm writing this with google docs now. As long as you are not using bullet points or etc; you should be fine. I do notice some errors that result from a slow ping, so it's worth trying noting it happens. I could more easily recommend using apple's built in \"note-taker\". Its responsive, practical and free.As far as \"Air-Play\" goes, simply amazing. Kind of a pain to set up though. One really has to go into every setting in I-Tunes and mark share libraries under preferences and account profile. When the set up is complete, you simply log in with your I-pad and use the same mobile user name and you are good to go. Of course you have to keep your computer running the whole time unless you have a dedicated server of some sort. Air-paly grants you access to your music, videos and HD collection. which makes that whole HDMI out thing really convenient. Granted its only 720p, Ive never noticed a huge difference between 720 and 1080p Additionally stream times are relatively quick. Just keep in mind this depends a whole lot on your network. Which bring me to my next issue of storage. I honestly feel the only thing anyone needs on tablet is, pictures and apps. Unless you are going on a long trip; a couple movies. I am content and don't think I would ever need an I-Pad with more storage. As far as 3G goes, will its just that. A three year old bandwidth solution. If you can get a tethering plan instead, I would highly recommend it, as you can also transplant GPS automatically when tethering.All in all I'm really content I took the I-Pad 2 plunge. A dive, I really never saw myself taking or considering. Having an android phone and P.C.; it would seem like honeycomb would have made more sense; considering the attractive specs and all. None the less, the IPad 2 meets my draconian standards for 2011. Making any other device look over weight and under-spec'd. While the consensus of professional reviewers have voted the camera insufficient, I could honestly say it does what I need it to do, which is provide fun and entertainment. The rear HD camera is similar to the one installed on the new macbook pro models (2011 refresh). Other than that, I don't plan on taking high quality photos with the device. I might do future reviews with the camera though. check out my youtube channel for video reviews, just look up oceansidecreations.", "Date": "March 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Ipad 2 Wonderful Tablet When It Works!

I bought it online. I received it 3 1/2 weeks later from china. It was amazing for the first 20 hours. The apps were so unbelievable. I have a touch, and it is so much better. On the second day, it started trying to shut down. The battery was at 80%. I tried shutting it off and could not. I called apple. I bought the extra care plan for 90 dollars so they are going to help me. Right? Wrong. The first representative we talked to had us restore it to the factory settings. It took 1 hour to download the 660 mg file. We then restored it to the factory settings. It started working perfectly. We were so happy. The problem was solved! I watched videos and played with it for hours. I ran the battery down and plugged it in overnight to charge. The next morning the problem was back in spades. It then started doing new things like flashing on and off. I went on the website and asked a specialist to call me again. She put me on hold. She was gone for a little while. When she came back, she said that I needed to mail it back to them to REPAIR it. I said What? I have the apple care plan and was told that you would send me a replacement. I have not even had this thing 2 days. She said that the other representative lied to me, and that she could not lie to me. I have 2 options. I can take it to the Apple Store (nearest one 165 miles away) or I can mail it and have it repaired and they will send the same one back to me. She made me an appointment at the store. I am driving the 165 miles to take it back. The second representative (a supervisor) told me that they would send me a replacement if I gave them a credit card and let them charge another 900 dollars for it. When they received the old one back, they would charge it back to me.I have had a kindle for years. The day I saw it on the Oprah show was the day I fell in love with it. I bought one the same day. The first kindle i received was great except the internet would not work. I called Amazon and they shipped me out a kindle the SAME DAY! I got it a couple of days later and loved it. It worked perfectly. I upgraded to a DX and have never had a problem.If you want to see a video of what it is doing, you can go to you tube and watch it. My username is caulret. I love Amazon and their amazing customer service!Edited 4-16-11I took it back to the Apple store. The people at the Plano Apple store were awesome. They did not want to give me my money back, but we negotiated with them and they ended up putting it back on our credit card with some creative measures. A more timid person would have had to take an apple gift card. This was all they said that they could do at first, but I held my ground.  I might buy this product again at a local Best Buy when they come available. If I decide to do that, I will edit this review.

Better Than a Netbook. Wish It Had Higher Resolution", "Author": "P. Colin McGraw \"AV, Computer & EnviroTech Nut\"", "ReviewID": "R17MLSR9WU45GC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The first iPad really defined the tablet market and while a trickle of competing tablets were released, none of them has matched the critical acclaim of the iPad 2. The consensus of CNET, Engadget and most other tech reviewers is that the Motorola Xoom is the closest competitor, but falls just short of iPad.This latest version of iPad sports a thinner design, front and back camera for casual filming and FaceTime/Skype video calls, a gyroscope, better speaker and, of course, a dual-core processor and 9x faster graphics capabilities. You still get the 10 hour battery life, but it's all wrapped up in a nicer package. That said, it doesn't seem drastically different than the original iPad and it feels like this version is simply an iPad with cameras, and the cameras don't perform especially well.Granted, the increased graphics capabilities do make a noticeable difference in the handful of games that take advantage of the increased speed (\"Infinity Blade\", \"Real Racing 2 HD\"), but most of the apps I use most frequently - e.g. CNN for iPad, Netflix, ABC Player, iTunes Video, iBooks, Pandora, SiriusXM, Apple Remote - don't feel like the user experience changed much beyond the increased volume coming from the speaker.My big disappointments with the iPad 2 are that the cameras aren't great, though that's forgivable since I'd use them mostly for video calling anyway, and that the screen didn't increase in resolution from the first generation iPad! I want my Retina display!However, overlooking the faults of the iPad 2, it's still the best tablet on the market, in my opinion.My kids love the educational apps (\"Monkey Preschool Lunchbox\", \"First Words Animals\", \"Shape Puzzle HD\", \"Talking Larry\", \"Peekaboo Barn\" and \"Garage Band\" are all highly recommended), and I think they've gone a long way in teaching even my mildly autistic daughter memorization and puzzle solving skills!I also love that I can get paid content from apps lie Netflix, (Comcast) Xfinity TV and Hulu+ and even free content like on-demand \"Bachelor\" episodes and other shows from the free \"ABC Player\" app. There's just so much capability available to the device through apps and certainly, the wealth of apps available in the App Store is one of the iPad's biggest strengths vs. competitors!It's also a great device for checking email and casually surfing the web, as long as the site you view doesn't require Flash, which is still unsupported. I used to have a netbook that took 5 minutes to boot, then had an awkwardly small browser window and slow response, but you see nothing but instant-on capability and smooth navigation with iPad. I'd definitely prefer this tablet to a netbook!Also, a couple of other miscellaneous tips for those interested:1. The new magnetic Smart Cover from Apple is a must-try! The automatic wake and sleep on opening/closing the cover is more handy than you might first think, as is the ability to roll the cover into a stand for the iPad! We watched Netflix from bed while my wife nursed our baby recently, and it would have been a pain without the handy stand!2. If you buy an AirPort Express or Apple TV, you can wirelessly stream music (and video in the case of the Apple TV) to a remote set of speakers using AirPlay or the Apple Remote app! It's cool to be able to listen to my iTunes content from my kitchen with the iPad as remote control!3. If you're debating whether to buy the WiFi-only or the WiFi/3G iPad, it's worth noting that by paying for the WiFi hotspot capabilities on an iPhone 4, you can not only get data, but location services for your iPad 2, so you can save a couple hundred dollars on hardware and future-proof your connection speed since you can buy a new phone instead of a new iPad to take advantage of increased network speed.In summary, I highly recommend the iPad 2 if you're in the market for a tablet. Its apps are highly entertaining, portable and easy/quick to launch a play, and it just may change the way you surf the web and check email! Even your kids will love it!The few innovations this model sports aren't what they could have been, but are nonetheless compelling.", "Date": "March 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Something to keep in mind about capacity.", "Author": "Mike-l", "ReviewID": "RN3TT7N4E9AWW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When choosing which capacity iPad to buy, you should be aware of the following:For many users, this 16GB iPad will be a great choice because, although you cannot expand its capacity, you can import files \"on-the-go\" with the following Apple accessory: the Apple Camera Connection KitYou can use the Apple Camera Connection Kit (the SD card reader part) to import media files directly into your iPad, without the need to sync to iTunes.This means you can bring along with you an almost unlimited number of media files, such as movies, mp3's, and photos.Perfect for a long trip, etc. Why not take along 100 GB or more? Fantastic!There are a few details you need to know to import media files this way.1). Create a folder on any SD card and name that folder \"DCIM\".2). Place media files into the DCIM folder.3). Important: The media file names have to be exactly 8 characters long (no more, no less), or the iPad will not see them.Examples: 8letters.mp3, 8numbers.jpg, 8Numbers.mp4, TheBirds.mp4, Img_9001.bmp.Those are really the main details, but here are a few more:When you insert the Card Reader (one of two devices in the kit) into the iPad, with an SD card in it, in a moment the iPad screen will show thumbnails of all the media files on the card.You can import some or all into the iPad. You cannot play media files from the card, you must first import them. To select some media files, just touch them to highlight them and choose \"Import\". Or, you can select \"Import All\".The iPad will ask if you want to Keep or Delete (on the card). Be careful to select Keep (in most cases).Valid video files need to be in the \".MP4\" format, version H.264. Or convert them to that format using almost any conversion program. I chose a size of 640 x 480, and it was perfect for filling up the screen.NOTE: the media files are imported into the \"Photo\" section of your iPad. Even the MP3's and Videos. So, to watch a movie, for example, select the Photo icon, not the Video icon on your screen (it won't be in the Video section).AND, you can delete any media files after playing them. That way, you can, for example, load a movie or two into the iPad, watch, then delete to make room for others.", "Date": "August 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "iPadLess - Especially For Photos", "Author": "B. Mullins \"Digital Rebel\"", "ReviewID": "R30YM9QE8I36W1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Apple markets this as the ultimate portable computer product, but it has serious shortcomings similar to the iPhone that I wasn't aware of as I don't own one.  If you have no interest in external files or photos, then this may not be important to you.  I waited a month for mine to be delivered, and after a week, I can say I'm keenly disappointed for specific reasons of Apple's own making.You can't transfer ANY file to it, you can only SYNC all files from one designated computer, i.e. tethered.Despite reading enormous reviews & comments about the original, as well as the 2, I never got the impression from anyone that this was the case.  There were a few rumblings about \"file handling\" and workarounds for it [\"everything's going to the cloud anyway\" \"just use dropbox\"] - but nothing that says what an incredible restriction it is for anyone using photos/movies at all.  Their only official solution is that you buy a $40 dongle that then will allow SD card content [no CF cards, which I have]  to be transferred directly.  But the worst part is that even if you were to transfer anything to it, it all gets dumped at the bottom of  \"saved photos\" without any file separation, and no ability to separate or make collections of them after transfer either.Unlike my iPods, you can NEVER transfer any existing file to another, or create a new one.  Only with Sync.  Apparently they want you to work \"with the app\" to do whatever you want to do.  So the only way you could store photos is randomly, unless you want to sync all file/photos from your one mothership computer.  The only semi-solution is to email yourself whatever you want, then download the photos/files...which again will only be dumped in the \"saved photo\" generic file.  You can imagine the limitations with original file sizes.Another key element to me is the lack of any tabbed browsing, whether in Safari or the special Bing app for the iPad [superior to Safari for most things].  So to actually write an email, while constantly switching between single browser pages etc. I'd find ridiculously cumbersome, not to mention that you can't resize ANY windows/apps at all.  You can only resize font/content within a given page.Which brings me to the keyboard, or lack thereof.  I had no idea that the numeric/symbol part of the keyboard is ALWAYS separate from the alpha part, meaning that if you're ever entering alpha/numeric content, i.e. passwords, airline record #'s etc. you have to hit one key to show the number part, hit the number/symbol, then hit another key to reveal the alpha part again, and back and forth endlessly.  In addition, because there's no real tactile feel for the keys, and because the entry points are different for every program [where the browser bar is vs input for youtube etc] you're staring at the keyboard to make sure your fingers are in the right place, then having to look back up and find where it's going, then back down etc., which not only slows the process, but can give you a headache from your neck bobbing up & down, as well as the different light/contrast levels for the keyboard vs the rest of the screen.Yes - I know that you can get a separate bluetooth keyboard, and that would solve some of it - but it also defeats some of the advantage of the form factor if you have to haul the 2 around everywhere you go.This doesn't even address any particular program you may want to work on - just the physical/OS realities of trying to work with it at all.Yes - scrolling through photos is very fast, and can be easily manipulated with your fingers.  Yes there are some very inventive apps out there that take advantage of finger-abilities, but what the finger giveth, it also taketh away when it comes to anything that requires content creation or precision.  I never expected it to do something like Photoshop, but to be this crippled wasn't in the cards either.This should be marketed to generic users not comfortable with computers, and iPhone users who are used to--and don't want anything more than what their iPhone will already do.  The geeks that have championed it should be dismissed for misleading everyone, as they will always find workarounds, and have multiple devices anyway [macbook air/pro/imac etc].  They could just as easily make an Android phone/tablet work for them.The strength of Apple is supposed to be it's user-friendliness, flexibility and support...with their advertising just teasing out a few of the myriad possibilities of the device.  In the iPad's case, I feel they did the opposite:  they oversold it's abilities, touting dual-core ships, 9x better graphics etc., when in fact none of that really matters at the only pace the interface allows.  [I got my mom a refurb original iPad, the first computer she can work - and there's little difference in most app performance]At the direction of my local Genius Bar & Store Manager, I went in search of an app that could help with photo file/transfer, but I queried one of the best reviewed, \"PhotoSync\" to be sure they responded:\"PhotoSync can only transfer photos to the save photos folder. This restriction is made by Apple unfortunately. Third party developers are not allowed to create albums in the camera roll, save photos in other locations than the saved photos folder, or to delete photo from the camera roll.  All these features Apple reserves completely for itself.  We hope that this will change one day in a newer iOS version but at this point it is the only thing we can offer (though we would like to offer more).\"That may be plenty for most others, but it's not for me.  I went back to see if I skipped parts of reviews that mentioned this, and no - i didn't.  Here's from Mossberg from WSJ...who runs down all the drawbacks, including poor-quality cameras etc., then says:\"there are two big omissions, one old and one new. The old one is that, like Apple's prior phones and tablets, the shiny new iPad 2 still won't play Adobe's Flash video in its built-in Web browser. This is a deliberate decision by Apple, and puts its devices at a disadvantage for some users when compared with Android tablets, which can play Flash, or say they will soon, albeit not always well.The other omission has to do with cellular data. The iPad 2 can't use, or be upgraded to use, the new, faster 4G cellular-data networks being rolled out.\"NO mention of any of the aspects that are important to me, and I would think to a substantial number of people...even if we aren't a majority.I want it to be the Next Big Thing - the one that replaces laptops with a smaller, more flexible form factor that's also inspiring to use.I'm just left with the deflated feeling that I've been had, and mostly because of some very dumb and ridiculous failures in their OS that don't have to be that way...just sticking a finger in my eye as a dedicated Mac user.**Update** I got the 11\" Macbook Air and am very happy with it - although it is a lot more computer power than I needed in pure portable terms -  it isn't substantially bigger than the iPad [especially with keyboard] for those of you that can afford it.", "Date": "April 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wifi problems", "Author": "A.

I have a large family, and every person here uses the iPad on a regular basis. It's been in use for the last 5+ months from morning until night and I am still delighted and amazed with it.I'd never personally owned a tablet before, or an Apple product, but we have multiple computers and all manner of electronic devices in our home and most people would consider me and my family to be techies. Because we have laptops and desktops and netbooks and smart phones, I didn't think that a tablet would particularly add to our level of connectivity or productivity. I was so wrong.Upon opening my iPad2, I was instantly struck by its thinness and its simplicity. There was just the tablet and a charger and a small, welcome pamphlet. I turned it on and it gracefully guided me through setting up my wireless connection. It offered me a tutorial, but I was too excited to bother with that. I was surfing the net within seconds because the interface is so intuitive.By now, there are loads of reviews that go into detail about the cameras and other hardware featured on the iPad2 so rather than bore you, I will focus on some of the real world ways this tablet has changed the way we do things in my home.As a homeschooling mother of a 9 year old, this tablet has made the best things about learning at home even better! The battery life is so good that we keep it with us all over the house. No need to worry about being near a power supply or booting up time or any of that. The iPad 2 is always connected, always ready. There are literally thousands of amazing apps, many of them free, that enrich my child's learning day. He is working on improving his handwriting and using an app that lets him write right on the screen! If he makes a mistake, it prompts him to try again until he gets the hang of it. Math, reading, journaling, science, anatomy, astronomy, geography, music - there's an app for that!Having the iPad2 has meant that whenever my son wonders about something or asks a question about something, we have the answers right in our hands. Remember when you didn't know how to spell a word or a definition in school? Remember how the teacher told you to go look it up? This is like that, only a thousand times better because there is no walk of shame past the whole class to the big dictionary. My son looks up things all day long just because he WANTS to!There are several exceptional music programs that feature an electronic keyboard. My favorite cost a couple of dollars and my boy is now playing music. It translates well, too, because I have a piano and he is able to play tunes he learned on the iPad on our full size piano.Of course, there are games, too. Lots of them. This has been a real boon when we go on road trips. Even though there is no wi-fi in the car, my son has loads of apps to keep him entertained until we reach our destination. No more asking \"are we there yet\"?I have a 15 month old granddaughter who is becoming very iPad saavy, too. It amazed me that even a young toddler quickly grasps the concept of icons and different apps doing different things. She actually knows how to turn it on and choose the correct folder to find the Fruit Ninja app and successfully launch it and play! There are several other games she enjoys, as well as some delightful alphabet games and story book apps. She also enjoys having us take video of her with the iPad and then play it back for her.I generally have it with me in the kitchen at meal times because I can look up a recipe and have it in front of me while cooking. Or I can watch a movie with the Netflix app while baking or preparing more complicated meals. If I didn't have a Kindle already, I would be using the Kindle app to read ebooks, too. Thanksgiving won't be nearly as tedious for me this year because of my iPad.I now take it with me when I travel instead of my laptop because it fits in my purse! I got a bluetooth keyboard to go with it so even when I need to type a lot, it's no problem (although the virtual keyboard is responsive and quicker to type on than you might think). I spent several days at a hospital with a friend and the iPad allowed us both to keep up with email, google for further medical info, and even watch a movie. I've discovered that there is wi-fi almost everywhere! (That's good because I didn't choose the 3G version.) My friend was so impressed that she bought an iPad as soon as she got home!Even though the device is almost fantastically thin and elegant, I would caution you to purchase and use a case all the time with your iPad. The screen is plenty tough but I have read many, many warnings about dropping it on one of it's corners, which results in the screen shattering. A case is good insurance and many of them feature the magnetic on/off, which conserves battery charge while protecting your iPad when you aren't using it.Other nice, but not essential, accessories are a protective screen film, a capacitive-style stylus, and an extra charger/car adapter. If you will be using your iPad as a replacement for a notebook on a regular basis, a wireless, bluetooth keyboard is nice, too. But other than a good case, the iPad2 needs nothing else to be up and running straight out of the box.Highly, highly recommended.", "Date": "September 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "First time owner, perfect.", "Author": "Jones102", "ReviewID": "R2ZWEC39TBC80T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Not previously owning an iPad I did not know what to expect purchasing the iPad 2.

While it does not have flash, I have so far found that to be no big deal anyway. if you absolutely have to have flash for something, look it up on your computer.Typing:Typing on it is not terrible but its not my favorite. I had an iPod touch and was used to typing on a touch screen so that part wasnt a big deal to me. The touchscreen itself is great and is very accurate as to actually registering the button you hit. This review is written on my laptop though because I knew that I wouldnt want to type several paragraphs on the iPad. For chatting on facebook or searching the internet and stuff like that though, it is actually really great.Cameras:Now the cameras are not 100% what I expected them to be. They are decent but are still grainy. Granted I havent taken pictures and then viewed them in normal size yet, so the graininess is just being blown up to iPad size. It might get better if it is shrunken down but so far it seems grainy to me. Really though, its better than not having a camera at all.Apps:Photobooth seems to be the most fun app for showing off the iPad to other people. it was nice that it came with it instead of having to buy it. All of the other apps pretty much work like the iPod touch's apps do, and I love the iPod touch. The email is a lot nice to use now that it is updated.Garageband is great! for $5 its the cheapest and best audio recording software you can get. It was the first thing that I bought and have been playing with it ever since. I like that you can play the instruments right on the iPad and record and edit it all.Safari is a really great and simple browser and it feels really natural to search the web on itiPod is really good too its like having your iTunes library on your computer and being able to go through all of your songs and have it all spread out where you can see it allI bought Legendary Blade II also for a few bucks and it really shows off how great the iPads graphics areScreen:Like I said above the graphics are really really good on it. My old iPod apps have all had to be updated because they are not even close to the quality that the iPad demands to look good. I think that the best way to see how good the graphics are is with books. the quality of writing is better than on my laptop.The touchscreen interface is the best that I have seen on any of the gadgets ive played with. Apple has dominated the touchcreen market and I dont think anyone comes close to them.Smart Cover:I dont know what it will do over the long run but so far it is great! I didnt buy it from amazon so i dont know what the legitimacy of the seller is, but as for the smart cover itself, I love it. the auto on auto off works great and so does the auto align. It looks great on the iPad 2 and it adds practically no thickness whatsoever. I feel like it actually does protect the iPad and it does its job. when it is rolled up and used as a stand it feels sturdy in both positions. I couldnt be more happy with it. clearly it doesnt protect the back from scratches and stuff, but the back is solid aluminum. aside from a few scratches, its not going to hurt it. I dont plan to drop my iPad, but i feel like if i did drop it face down its strong and cushioned enough that it wouldnt destroy my screen either. I would definitely buy it againMemory:I got the 16 gig and it has more than enough for my 600 songs a 125 apps.I would totally recommend this to anyone and if anything changes I will updateThat is all I have but if you found it helpful I would really appreciate you taking a few seconds to hit the helpful button :) Thanks", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love it.", "Author": "Andrew D.

I like the customization of android, but in the end it came down to the stability and the vast amount of apps. Before considering buying an iPad I was wondering why people would not shut up about how many apps there are, well now I really do get it. While some of them aren't very useful for me, there are quite a few i would say that are very well designed and extremely useful and just plain entertaining.I really hated the fact that there was no flash, and no true multiple tasking, but after taking a chance on the iPad I realized I really didn't notice the flash too much, however, the lack of true multitasking can be frustrating at times. The iOS definitely needs an update, but for the first time user it will be a pleasurable experience.The quality of the ipad is incredible, and the experience from startup to actually using the device was impressive to say the least. The screen is beautiful and the screen is extremely responsive. Oh, and not to forget, the battery life is unreal at a true ten plus hours of browsing and streaming video and audio.The Internet browsing experience is very nice, I've had no issues at all. The web pages render perfectly and overall is a blast to use ( even without flash).I would whole heartily recommend the iPad 2 to anyone seeking a device that allows you to browse the web, check email, play games, check and pay bills, loves creating anything at all, or just wants to sit on the couch and watch some Netflix. The iPad isn't flawless but at this price it is very fair for what you get. If you are looking to totally replace your laptop, it's possible, but it just depends on what you really use it for.

The Apple store in Reston VA refused to fix or replace it, hiding behind a claimed \"3 month warranty for (new) replacements.

The Motorola Xoom appeared to be very well built, but a little on the heavy side.When I tried an ipad after sifting through the sea of Android tablets at the local electronics store, I was sold instantly.  The user interface is so smooth and simple compared to Android.  I also knew that Apple products are typically less buggy than Android.  I've had a lot of difficulties with the bugginess of all my Android phones.  I may have been more courageous to try an Android tablet if more of them had support from Cyanogenmod.  As of now, there are only two Android tablets (not great ones) that they officially support.  Android 4.0 is coming soon, and looks promising, but that's yet to be seen.The ipad is so smooth to the touch, and so comfortable in the hands... it's competitors are no match in initial impressions.After having plenty of time to play with it, I have mixed feelings about it.There are some drawbacks.  Every time you download something from itunes (including music, videos, apps, and books) it asks for your password (if you haven't entered it in the last 15 minutes).  It even asks for your password when downloading free items.  I understand that this was a measure to stop children from running up bills on their parents accounts, but I don't have children, and there is no way to disable this feature.In the appstore, there are a lot of free apps, but I feel there are many more for free in the Android market.  I like free apps.  I don't like paying huge costs for hardware, then still having to pay for every little thing I need it to do.  But that appears to be the case here.  I have found some cool stuff for free, though.  It's just riddled with ads.iOS 5.0... I guess that's the big thing right now, but I'm not that excited about it.  My ipad shipped with 4.3 and I could barely tell the difference after the update.  If they were trying to gain Android's strengths with that update, they FAILED.  iOS defnitely does have it's own strengths, though.I am absolutely astonished at the battery life on the ipad.  I can play games all night, while connected to wifi, and occasionally streaming videos... and by some miracle, I still have plenty of battery life left.  My phone (Motorola Droid 3) would not stand for this... it's dead as a doornail before I get to 3 hours of playing games on it.I previously owned a Kindle 3 e-reader, which persuaded me that paper books were still the best way to go.iBooks changed my mind!  NO EXTERNAL LIGHT NEEDED! Unlike the Kindle or Nook.  You can read in the dark without disturbing your bedmate.  It actually looks and acts like an open book, too!  I'm so excited about that.  When you flip the page, you literally touch the edge of the page on the screen and flip it like a book's page!  The screen is very sharp, and brightness is adjustable to levels that are tolerable in the dark or in bright sunlight.  Honestly, it's completely worth being 3 times the cost of a Kindle just as an e-reader.Internet browsing is terrific.  Much better than I ever expected from a mobile device.  All this bickering about iOS not using flash... it must be old news.  I've loaded flash content on both Safari and the Dolphin browser (from the app store).  What's more... flash appears to be smoother on my ipad than on my flash supported Droid 3.Also worth noting, the ipad docks to my car stereo just like my ipod classic does.  The stereo is able to maintain control over it just as it does an ipod (I read mixed reviews about this functionality).  The surprising thing... the stereo also charges the ipad (although, I believe it's at a slower rate).All in all, the ipad is great, but I still feel the pinch of the lack of customization that I've enjoyed with Android.  In physical form, it has no competitor.  I'm happy with my purchase.Cyanogenmod! This is a call for a port!

I loved that movie for all the action and, of course the story, but more for the way that the creators of the film portrayed the future. All of the self driving cars, and gadgets that no one had ever thought of.Anyway, I was watching it the other day and the police chief guy with the bald head and glasses was carrying around something that looked like a book, but it had a screen. It seemed as if the screen was a touch screen, and he was having what appeared to be a video chat with another law enforcement agent on the thing. This was an idea of a gadget that the creators of the story and movie thought they would see in the distant future, like 2020's or 2030's. An awesome portable, touch screen device that had most, if not all the functionality of a PC, but smaller than a book. It's not 2020 something, though, and I realized that I had a much better, sleeker, and if I might say more futuristic looking device that performed as described right next to me. It was the iPad2.Now, I'm no Apple fanboy. Not in the least. I grew up using Windows machines at home, and my only experience with Apple before buying my first ipod touch 4G was in the \"computer lab\" in elementary school. But, last June I picked up the iPod touch 4G like I said, and I was blown away. It was so easy to use. So portable, so fast. I didn't like one thing, though, and it was the fact that the damn screen was too small to really use it for all the things that you could use it for other than just music and videos, like surfing the net, or using any of the million apps available. My hands were just too big.This was a problem. I don't have a lot of money to throw around, and the next step up on the Apple mobile line was the iPad2, and the 32GB version that I wanted was around $600! Thats a lot of money. And I already had an iPod, and at least two other Windows based machines that are very fast and up to date. It just didn't make sense to really buy the thing.I just kept falling more and more in love with the iPod touch, though, and more particularly with iOS and how well it performed. Everything worked and made sense. You wanted music, you hit the music \"button\" on the screen. Email you say? After you set up your account you just press the mail button. Pretty simple. The touch gestures are amazing too. The responsiveness and speed at which the device reacts is amazing. And its so smooth, people. Seriously, if you haven't handled an iOS5(when I got the ipod touch it was iOS4 i think, but the update is awesome) device you owe it to yourself to try it. Its incredible.But, I was still using that super tiny screen, and I couldn't send an email because my fingers would hit like 3 keys at a time and it would take a year to type it all out correctly. Surfing the net, although super fast and smooth, was horrible because typing a web address took a long time. What was I to do? I just gave up on using the iPod for anything other than media, and the occasional youtube video. I still played games on it, but even with the games, I really wanted a bigger, brighter screen.I started to look for reasons to buy the iPad2, and I couldn't come up with any. Not for about two months, at least, until my girlfriend said she needed a laptop and didn't really have any money to buy one. Bingo. I would give her the laptop, and even though she lives with me and I can still use the thing, I'll be down a machine and it leaves an opening for me to replace it. Right? Right!Off to my local retailer(sorry amazon)I go. 30 minutes later(store is literally right down the street from me) and I'm at home, updating the operating system and transferring all of my previous purchases and then I'm up and running. I was blown away.I knew what I was getting, a much bigger version of the iPod touch 4G. And, I got exactly that, and a whole lot more. First, the screen size is a huge plus. Much bigger than the iPod touch of course, and more than big enough to handle any number of tasks or games, or whatever. The keys on the touch screen keyboard are a really good size. No missed keys here people. And my fingers aren't small. The screen is so bright, and it just begs you to touch it. Movies and videos look great, and the web and all the apps are very vivid. This thing just looked great.It was lightweight too, and very thin. Physically this thing is like a very thin composition pad. Actually, much thinner than a composition book. About the same weight, though. Overall, the dimensions and weight make this thing ultra portable.If you're at all familiar with iOS you know about the apps, and they're pretty much all great. There are quite a few that are free as well, so don't let that stop you. In fact, some of the best games and apps available are free, or are just a buck so its not that bad. They range from super useful to super fun. Everything from photo transferring(desktop/laptop to ipad without USB)to remote desktop connection, to Grand Theft Auto is available, and almost anything you can think of has an app. Need a level? You can get one on your ipad for free. Want to tweak a photo? Get photo toaster jr for free and get tweaking. The apps are a real strong point for this device, and they make up for some of short comings of the device(more on that later.The battery last forever. Ten hours is more than enough for me. Plus you get a wall charger and a usb style hook up that you can use to hook up to your car if you have the adapter. Sweet.Like I said, processing speed is very quick, and it handles everything I throw at it all day long with no problems. Videos run without clipping or lag time and apps load up and run perfectly. I never have any freezes or crashes. Awesome.I can't say enough good things about this thing. Really. I can say few bad things as well. I wouldn't say bad, but you know, not what I would want from a \"perfect\" device.First, there are no USB ports. This sucks. There are apps that like I said earlier will help you transfer photos and videos, and documents, but it would be better if you could just plug directly in to the device.Second, you can't charge this thing with your laptop. Or I can't. It has to be plugged into the wall. Not too bad, but it sucks if you need to charge and you have laptop full of juice but no outlet.The biggest problem I have is the price point. Honestly, this thing is worth double what they want for it in my opinion. It will redefine how you look at computing in general. It is so much more intimate. But, even with that said, I think I have the right after purchasing to complain about the price a little. Again, worth every penny, but really pricey and I had to save up for the thing, and that sucks sometimes.Other than that, go buy this thing. Seriously. And shame on you if you think you can get what this thing delivers from a Kindle. Those guys are playing a very bad game of catch up. And they're going to lose. Think Android to compete with the iphone. I've used both. Androids are horrible. Epic fail. Now Amazon wants to lose money trying to compete with a legend. Trust me, if you want mobile, go Apple.

The biggest issues I have with its power relate to charging. It comes with a special 10W power adapter which allows you to charge the iPad in a relatively reasonable timeframe, but charging it via the computer's USB port is as easily measured in days as hours.The charger looks exactly like the ones that come with the iPhone and iPod, and it will charge slowly with those, but the iPad's 10W adapter will overcharge the batteries in the iPad's smaller cousins, seriously diminishing their life.

I tried the MOTOROLA XOOM Android Tablet (Wi-Fi) and was happy enough until I tried this iPad 2.  I love this updated version!  The only issue I had was trying to decide which version to get since there are many options.Storage capacity can be 16 GB, 32 GB or 64 GB.  I would recommend at least the 32 GB since you cannot expand the storage and although apps do not take up much space, I was amazed at the amount of stuff I loaded onto my iPad (photos, movies, music, documents, etc.).  Trying to save some money, I wondered if I should get wi-fi only or the wi-fi/3G combination and with which service provider, AT&T; or Verizon? Every iPad has wireless technology built in and automatically finds wi-fi networks easily but if you want to use it while traveling, the great outdoors or rural areas, wi-fi is not always an option.  If you have an iPhone 4, you can use it as a personal wi-fi hotspot for your iPad but your iPhone carrier might charge extra when this option is used.  Also, GPS is on the 3G models only, wi-fi provides an approximate location and this could be an issue if you love using Four Square or other GPS based applications.  More importantly, the wi-fi only model cuts your battery time down (~8 hours).  If you do choose wi-fi + 3G, I would check with AT&T; or Verizon networks for pricing before deciding.  Both seem to provide reasonable costs for domestic usage but international usage is outrageous.  The previous iPad allowed any carrier to be used overseas (which is a bargain) but I'm not sure if AT&T; and Verizon models allow for the same thing.This new version is lighter, faster, slimmer and has slightly longer battery life at 10 hours.  I love the brilliant LED backlit display on the 9.7 inch screen.  I'm still not a fan of Pages (iWork) but it is possible to get Word documents on your iPad through iTunes.  There is no official Microsoft version but being able to download Word documents from my pc to the iPad and work on them makes a huge difference for me. I really love the technological improvements that allows this iPad to know your every move and be more responsive.  No matter how you rotate this iPad, the display self adjusts - even if you place it upside down!  It makes playing games like Critter Ball that much more fun to play and allows viewing movies or reading a book in any position.  Need I comment about Apple apps?  They beat the Android and every other market out there on this score and help make Apple products first choice.For me, The only thing that prevents this tablet from being perfect is a better camera and the lack of Mozilla (I know this will never happen).  I have tried a lot of tablets and prefer this one over all others.  Yes, it is expensive but I consider it a good investment since it allows me to complete tasks on-the-go and help pass the time while waiting.  I think having this iPad along with an iPhone (or any smartphone) is the best combination.  Smartphones can provide information from the web but their small screen size can make viewing difficult and this iPad allows for a perfect union.", "Date": "April 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Much More Than the Novelty I Thought I was Buying", "Author": "D. Reinstein \"marindavid\"", "ReviewID": "RQTYDX3UXR5S3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After being tempted to buy a tablet for many months, when Apple introduced its new generation iPad and, at the same time, dropped the price of the earlier version, the iPad2 by $100 across-the-board, I jettisoned the thoughts about buying a relatively inexpensive Android device with a 7-8\" screen and bought the basic iPad2 with the minimal 16GB and WiFi only. Initially thinking that I was buying a new toy, a `novelty', I soon discovered that the iPad2 is much more than that. I use it for dozens of things I never imagined using one for and have become quite attached to it, especially when travelling or just sitting in my favorite easy chair at home.A great deal has been written about the technology and capacities of the iPads, so I will not waste your time reiterating them here. Suffice it to say that this one is the most basic model available. It requires a WiFi connection to operate and its total storage capacity is what seems like a `mere' 16GBs. My focus here is more on my personal experience with my first tablet. I am glad that I waited for the iPad.Being a 65 year old man, my are no longer nimble enough to manage the tiny keys on a Smart Phone nor is my vision acute enough to read things easily on a 3\" screen.  On the iPad, however, with its 9.7\" screen and keypad that is entirely adequate, I have become quickly facile.The limited memory is entirely adequate as I do not download and keep movies and am not an accumulator of music. The memory is needed to manage the necessary receiving elements of the various applications (Apps) that I choose to install the capacities for. Many are free, a lot of them cost between 99 cents and $3.99 and some cost more. The most expensive one I have is called \"Pages\" and is a comprehensive word processing and office management suite. Compared to the prices of `installable' programs, this is remarkable cheap. Some of my favorite apps are free, like voice recording capacities and \"GoSkyWatch\", an App that looks at the night sky through the out-facing camera and shows what constellations are there. It is like having my own telescope.The 20-30 Apps I currently have installed have used about 2GBs of the total available hard drive. I don't expect to run out. The exclusive use of WiFi vs. 3G has a pro and con to it. In the Pro column, WiFi is pretty universally available in most places and it requires no paid data plan to access the internet and use all of the iPad's features. On the Con side of the ledger, the device is usable ONLY where there is a WiFi connection available. With 3G and a data-plan, the iPad can connect from anywhere you can access a signal for your cell phone.At this time, for my own purposes, this basic iPad2 has been a rather surprising delight. I understand that the camera resolution on the third generation iPad is far superior, but what I see on this iPad2 is perfectly adequate for me - and, I expect, for most other people as well.The price is right and the product is truly outstanding.", "Date": "May 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "One Word:  Splashtop", "Author": "Mastodan \"Mastodan\"", "ReviewID": "RHCCZCFW5SYMZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "\"This sunlight is OK, I guess, I mean it provides all my food I suppose, but I have to give it zero stars out of 5 because I danced naked outside one day and it totally gave me a sunburn.\"I swear, this is what it sounds like when people complain about new technology.  Is there an astounding amount crammed into a small, considerably weight-reduced package? A resounding yes.  Are there some pretty impressive apps available for it?  Per this review's title, yes.  Is it a completely effective replacement for meaningful human contact?  No, but I'm reserving judgement for when generation 3 arrives with an optional mounting harness for love dolls.Look, its not perfect...realistically, it'll be a solid 4 or 5 years before a device in this price range can match the 160 gigs of an ipod classic with flash memory, and the dual core chip, while fine for day to day maneuvers, can lag in the more intensive tasks (not that there are many apps that convert things to DivX format or remotely control nuclear cooling towers).  Additionally, the lack of slots for SDHC or its 'micro' version knocks off a point or two for versatility.  Once data is on the thing, your only hope of exporting is via email or with third party software (and be REALLY careful to test it out with nothing crucial already installed, as there are some abysmal titles out there).  Also, I feel a decade of that proprietary cable is enough.Gripes aside, this thing is a joy to use.  The battery is every bit as good as people claim, my average use per charge is right between 11 and 12 hours.  No screen protector was included, but aftermarket options are plentiful, and the matte finish option I tried produces an incredibly natural response, especially when using a stylus.  Need to entertain a child 1-3 years of age?  Furry Friend is a fantastic app, and less than 2 dollars in the full version.  Splashtop, though, is the primary component of the 5 stars.  Full version is fairly inexpensive (intermittently goes on sale for 1.99), and it has saved me both time AND monitor life; Splashtop is remote control for your PC or MAC...nothing new there, those in the IT world have been doing this for some time, and its one of the features advertised for Windows 7 in particular.  But the versatility is the selling point.  You could be stuck at an airport, and edit a slew of photographs, browse on Firefox with your home presets/favorites, access anything your home computer can access, all with intutitive touch controls.With the sum of available science today, one could certainly design a device with more features and performance.  Sure it would cost a ridiculous sum, but ultimately, you get what you pay for.  I am a PC guy (only in computer preference), but I have to admit this is an impressive slab of glass and aluminum.  As for those claiming the purchase of an Apple product will designate you as a sheep or conformist, I applaud your staunch independence...just be sure you avoid any Meat, Fruits, Grains and Vegetables grown more than 50 miles from you, switch to a all-recycled burlap wardrobe, Handcraft your furniture from sustainably harvested logs downed with your own teeth, coat the whole thing with cruelty-free mud, and power your domicile with a small windmill and excercise bike hooked up to a homemade turbine.

I didn't see much utility for it and frankly thought it was a bit silly and I wasn't all for it. I didn't see much use for it although I recognized it was a nifty, cool little device but thought it was a bit too much like an Ipod touch. Forward to 2012 I now am the owner of an Ipad 2 and loving it, I'm converted. It wasn't until I had the opportunity to spend time experimenting and playing with the tablet that I saw myself using it me and bringing it along with me, in short wanting one. I've owned an Ipad for a little over two weeks and with this time passed by I've had enough time to enjoy and experiment enough with this device that now seems to be the right time to review it. If you must know I went for the Ipad 2 simply because I liked how remarkably slim and light it was and although the Ipad 3 has the new retina display, to me it didn't significantly expand the second generation of Apple tablets for me to pay a hundred dollars more (money is important after all and is a deciding factor) to have the \"new\" product I decided. I read reviews and articles, comparisons between the second and third generations of Ipad and came to the conclusion that I'd be well off with 16 GB Ipad 2 and from then on would decide whether or not to upgrade to one of the future Ipads depending on my use and enjoyment of the tablet.You can say all you want but no one presents and markets a product quite like Apple is capable of (and does). They're often criticized for how expensive their products are yet they are everywhere and well designed and thought and they're hard to ignore.  Apple had success with the Mac and Mac book and their different models, the Ipod, the Iphone (all with variations and updated models of the same product) and more recently with the Ipad. I'll be the first to admit Apple's gadgets and electronic devices can be expensive but I've also never had a problem with any apple product I've owned in the past.The size is one of the best thing about the Ipad, it's neither too big nor too small and the screen is big, bright and clear and there's just so much you can do. The interface is excellent; it feels and works great, looks neat and simplistic and it's very easy to catch on. It just feels natural and anyone from a child to a grandparent can use it and understand the bare basics an enjoy it. The applications or \"apps\" as they are called are truly what MAKE the Ipad the innovative device that it is, otherwise it does a lot of what your Iphone/Ipod touch or Laptop/Desktop do which is still keep in mind, excellent. There are ton of apps for different needs be it for reading books and magazines, to taking notes, playing fun games and everything in between. There are ton of apps already on the market, some brilliant and very useful to some downright stupid and new ones are constantly being created. Many apps are free, not most but a good quantity are and the range from the 0.99-1.99-2.99-3.99... 9.99 etc.  There are apps that serve as business tools, diverse utilities, fun mindless games like the popular Angry Birds, there's Safari as the internet browser, you can set up you e-mail accounts, manage your bank account, make hotel reservations etc. The list goes on please believe! There's of course Itunes from which you can buy music, movies and more and have them uploaded instantly to your Ipad. You can also sync it to any existing Itunes account and select material to upload to the device. I also like that there is both an inward and outward camera like on the Iphone so you can take pictures of anything you see or yourself which is a very nice option I thought I'd mention.  Those programs and apps are all stored in your Ipad via the memory it contains whether it's 16, 32 or 64 GB and ultimately the amount of Gigabytes you have determines how much content can be stored on the Ipad. The battery life is roughly ten hours (of course depending on certain factors such the brightness, volume etc.) which is not bad at all and still better than my laptop.These are just a few thoughts and suggestions if you're considering purchasing an Ipad.-  For me just the Wi-Fi model was fine. However, if you're often on the go and have a need for internet that can't wait and need it \"right now\" all the time without close Wi-Fi access available at all times then maybe you should consider getting a 3G model for just a little more $ with a monthly or pre-paid plan.-Another thing you might want to consider is the memory you're going to need. The 16G model has in reality 13.9 G (there is always a certain portion of available storage taken before even touch it) and I think for the average user this will be fine (besides you can always remove apps etc. and it does keep track of whatever you've downloaded in case you want it back). Most apps don't take up a whole lot of storage room although some are bigger than others. The same with music, it depends how much you plan to use the Ipad for music and this also applies to the books you buy and how many you plan to buy keep (although the books aren't as bad as the music and movies as far as I'm concerned, I wouldn't worry too much unless you're a hardcore reader who plans to store plenty of books).  If you're planning to upload a lot of movies or have/use a lot of data then perhaps a 32G or 64G model would be a better fit for you considering how movies can easily be over 1GB each. They're more expensive of course but may warrant the consideration if you'd rather have the larger number of Gigabytes but and not take the available space entirely than have one that's filled up soon after.-If you're interested in owning the latest thing and see potential great things about the Ipad 3 like the retina display and the upgraded processor you may want to go ahead with the newer model. Otherwise the second generation Ipad makes a viable option if you want to save a bit of money, other than that the two devices are basically identical and at first look no one could notice a difference between the 2 and 3. If you're considering either I suggest you do some research as I did, especially if money is an important factor in your decision and then decide for yourself which one it is you want.-Another somewhat big decision is the color choice, whether you want a black Ipad or a white one. Personally I went with the white one as I liked how it looked and it seems to me that most people I know own the black. The color is not all that important it's what it can do and the options it gives you although some will insist on owning either one color or the other.-Last you may want to protect the Ipad with a protective screen just in case (it's always better to be prepared) to protect it. You may want to consider purchasing a nice case to store and carry it and maybe even a stylus pen if you think you might be into that type of thing.In a world where tablets are rapidly and steadily selling Apple's Ipad has in reality very little competition partly due to clever marketing but mostly due to the great product they delivered.  Don't have a lot of negatives, if any, to say for the most part I am really liking it and find myself using it every single day and it nearly replaces my laptop. It does close to everything I want to do with my laptop usually, for me the Ipad is now one of those things tht I can't live without (not literally but still!).  I made the jump and find myself enjoying the Ipad and like it for its portability which makes it great for travelling and carrying wherever I go. It's entertaining, useful and smooth.  I like that I can have so much in one convenient sized device that doesn't take up a whole lot of space, can access wi-fi, check my e-mails, play games and more. It's not as big or heavy as a laptop, does not overheat even when running for several hours and opens MUCH faster yet it's not so small that it's inconvenient to type or a little hard to read (or touch in the case of my cellular phone) and do tasks with a cell phone, it's a perfect balance if you will. I really don't have anything negative to say about my Ipad, it would be nice in the future to have place for a USB/SD slot and I believe that may be coming eventually.  Obviously I've been praising the Ipad a lot  and I don't regret my purchase, full marks *****.", "Date": "July 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Never thought I would actually use one--Now that I have it, I can't live without it", "Author": "Aerfally", "ReviewID": "R3574RJ9KZHVB6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great gadget.

I have a couple of laptops and have owned a netbook for a couple of years. I bought the netbook because of its portability, size, and relative light weight when I am on the road.Throwing caution to the wind, I bought this  Ipad2 and it was instant love. Installation was a snap and took a matter of minutes per the instruction card which comes with the device as well as accompanying online prompts. There are a huge number of applications available for the IPad and many of them are free; others are available at minimal cost. The learning curve for using this device is fast; if you own an IPhone it is even faster. The platform this is built on is similar in operation to the IPhone. As for installing new apps, I have yet to encounter any installation problems with my add ons, though some people have.If you install the ereader app, it negates the need for a Kindle or Nook. While I'm not about to toss my Kindle, this is a nice alternative to carting around yet another device when I travel.The battery's charge is supposed to last about 10 hours. That is a fairly accurate measure as I've been averaging about 9 to 10 hours before draining the charge.The device's design is truly a work of art. While this is not a very constructive comment re: to buy or not to buy, I'm driven by aesthetics. I'm drawn to attractiveness and functionality. I own a lot of Apple products and their purchase has partially been driven on visual appeal and cleverness, though ultimately i have fallen in love with their ease of operation and their ability to go way beyond most folks'  imagination. What I am trying to say is that even if you buy this blindly assuming that it will do most of the things your laptop does you'll probably be surprised by its many added features. The  Ipad2 is very light and portable. It is easy to hold and with a smart cover or case that converts to a stand, it works great on a  flat surface or a lap. It can slip easily into a purse. I usually carry a small or medium Ameribag and have no problem getting it to fit. In order to keep this pad in pristine condition and safe, I installed a screen protector, a back cover, and a smart cover. For what it's worth, this pad is nifty but I wouldn't try to see if it will bounce if dropped. Additional accessories are readily available such as Bluetooth keyboards, headsets, and external speakers.The 32 GB capacity is more than adequate for my needs. However, an application junkie may need 64GB. I mention this because my son is upgrading because he wants to add more apps and is running out of space. 16GB or 32GB is probably adequate for most users.Response time is robust on this little sucker. While I didn't buy the 3G model, I haven't had a problem attaching to free WiFi and reception has always been good given that I'm usually in populous areas.The pad's sound quality is good as well as the screen's image. The camera is o.k., but I prefer my IPhone's camera or better yet a high res dedicated camera.While I had no previous experience with IPad's first incarnation, IPad2 seems to be an improvement over the first release due tofaster processing speed and a lighter and more compact design. While there is no slot for an SD card, I suspect that subsequent IPads will feature better and/or more sophisticated cameras and video conferencing capabilities, and an SD card slot among other things.Bottom line: the IPad2 is a fantastic device that is more versatile  than a netbook but lacks some of the functionality of a fully integrated laptop.

For various reasons I did not have an original iPad despite wanting one, so this review will focus on the iPad2 and not the differences between the two generations.1.  Screen.  The Screen on the iPad2 is gorgeous.  HD movies really do look HD, and the iPad2 provides a very satisfactory viewing experience.2.  Battery life:  Very good.  Despite moderately heavy \"on the road\" use, I have never managed to run my battery even to 50%.  Others are reporting 11-12 hours and this is consistent with what I am seeing.  Apple did a good job with this battery, and the overall power management of the iPad2.  I have my screen set to auto-dim (where the screen adapts to the lighting in the room) and no doubt this helps.  I have never needed or wanted to fiddle with the screen using this setting.  Ordinary Apple chargers work fine to charge the iPad2 battery.  However, many computer USB ports do not have enough juice to charge the iPad2.  My main Windows computer does not; not even from a powered USB hub.  Many third-party chargers for the iPhone turn out not to work with the iPad2 although all of the Apple ones I have tried do, and some of the after-market ones do.  So far my experience has been that if they sold it in the Apple store, it works.3.  Browsing the web.  The iPad2 is peerless for just plain web browsing, and this is what it excels at.  The virtual keyboard is OK for short email messages or filling in fields on websites.  For more heavy duty typing, there are a number of fine outboard keyboards out there.  I was delighted to find that my Apple Bluetooth Keyboard works splendidly with the iPad2 and for road trips I pack it along.4.  Cameras.  There are two; front and back.  They are exactly what you would expect: OK for quick snapshots, but a lens a fraction of an inch in diameter is not going to take the place of a real camera; we all know that.  They work reasonably well for what they are.  I have not yet tried the various videophone applications so I cannot speak to that.The iPad2 is thin and easy to carry.  The Apple case, which many people buy, is nice to have, but it does not protect the back of the iPad.  There are any number of aftermarket leather or other kinds of cases that provide the iPad2 with more protection.  Most of these will cause the iPad2 to power down when the front flap is closed, just as the Apple cover does.  This is a very nice feature.The iPad2 has infinite professional and personal uses.  I can have it in the courtroom (I am an attorney) and look up cases on-line quickly and snappily using the 3GS, since most courtrooms do not provide counsel with Wi-Fi.  Email, Web access, etc., these things are all becoming a fundamental part of our lives.  I used to use my iPhone for portable Web access, and it was OK for that, but the iPad2 with its larger screen is infinitely better for this.  In my life Web access wherever I go is the main use for the iPad2, and it is a critical use.My main negative on the iPad2 are these: 1.  No dedicated USB2 port.  Why not? 2.  The lack of a USB port makes it very difficult to print anything with the iPad2 and for some reason Apple does not make printing easy, or hardly even possible.  Apple flat-out does not encourage or want its iPad2 users to print off of their iPads.  Whether they are trying to protect their notebook sales or there is some other reason, I do not know.  Eventually I anticipate that competition and pressure from the user base (me!) will force Apple to relent on this.In the 21st century, devices like the iPad2 are destined to become a fundamental part of our personal kit.  The iPad2 is beautifully made, and for most of us very much worth having.  Highly recommended.  RJB.", "Date": "July 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Save your money.

Apple products are said to be easy to use but they don't live up to the hype. iTunes expects the user to know what to do. There are no clues as to how it should be used. All of that money and they can't even afford tool tips. I've spend an hour trying to figure out how to put a PDF into my iPad and it's like pulling teeth. A simple task made difficult by a bad design. Why can't I just drag and drop the files using Windows explorer like every other hardware product in the world? Why so difficult?Apple had an edge when they were first to market. Now they're relying on the loyal base and offer no advantages. Pay more and do less. Still no USB or SD card slots? It makes every task difficult.Good for browsing the web and checking email but not much more.I had to try it and regret the purchase.Simple tasks could be A LOT easier.------------------------------------------------------------------After wasting another hour of my life I finally figured out how to put PDFs onto this piece of junk. When I first started iTunes there was only one menu available and it was hidden under a graphic in the upper left corner of the app. I \"Added files to library\" from the menu and selected my PDFs. This made them appear in iTunes under Books but it didn't put them on my iPad even after several syncs and prayer.The solution(of course) was to select Show Menu Bar from the first menu to get a second menu (File, Edit, View, ...), then I could select View Side Bar to get a third menu I needed to add my PDFs. The first screen they appeared in was also labeled Books but it is obviously something different. After doing a sync the PDFs didn't appear in the Acrobat Reader where I expected them(why would they?) and I eventually found them in iBooks.The PDFs still won't appear in either of the PDF apps I installed.  Why not? This makes absolutely no sense. Easy? No.I tried using the iPad search feature but it can't find the PDFs that are on the iPad even though they show up in iBooks. The files are there. Why doesn't search find them? Because iPads are over priced JUNK! Basic functionality doesn't work.Apple products are supposed to be easy to use but they are far from it.Very disappointed.  Not designed well and lots of room for improvement. It makes me wonder what they've been working on for the last few years. It wasn't usability.------------------------------------------------------------------The more i use it, the more I hate it.

Not to be outdone, I bought an iPad as well.  Now I thought I'd be using my iPad more than my Android, but this has turned out not to be the case.  You see,  Android and iPad are two very different devices, with one device often doing things much better than the other one.  So I've found myself using each device for different purposes, and I've found my Android device to be much more practical for everyday use.Here's a summary of my findings over two weeks of using both devices:OS Stability:  The winner here is the iPad.  I've experienced occasional freezes on the Android tablet, along with delays and slowdowns.  The only delay I've experienced on the iPad is when I'm using Safari and want to type in an address in the address bar.  There is a small delay from when I type the 'www' to when it shows up on the screen.  No big deal.Camera:  iPad is far and away the winning choice here, especially since my Android device came with a shabby VGA camera.  I can't speak for other devices like Galaxy Tab, but the iPad with its front and rear facing cameras definitely wins.Video Chat:  iPad.  Especially since my Android tablet doesn't, as yet, support this.Screen Resolution:  iPad.  What can I say about this, other than the difference is like night and day.  The Viziotab's screen resolution is, in a word, ugly.  It seems very one-dimensional compared to the iPad's.  The iPad screen is clear, bright, and attractive.Browsing:  I'm going to give this one to Android.  Although iPad's browsing is fast and Safari is easy to use, Android has flash.  Yes, I know, the resource hogging flash!  But here's the thing about flash for me: There are a couple of mission-critical websites I use constantly  one is for my job) that use flash.  With the iPad, it's a no go -- unless you buy a third-party browser that supports flash.  So Android wins here.Photos:  This is a toss up.  While iPad blows away Viziotab in terms of resolution, Android wins simply because you don't need to go through iTunes to sync your photo library.  I think I'll be using my iPad to share those photos from my recent trip to Hawaii, but if I need to 'manage' my photos I'll use my Android tablet.Video:  Again, a toss up.  iPad presents videos beautifully, but management is a pain in the a**.  First, iPad doesn't support all video formats.  And second, you have to sync your videos through iTunes.  So, if I have that iPad-compatible video of my trip to Egypt, I'll share it on iPad -- otherwise I'll be using my Android tablet to manage my video collection.Email: I was at first impressed by the iPad email app.  But I enjoy reading my email on Android.  Perhaps it's the Android's integrated GMail app, which makes viewing email a more pleasant experience.  iPad just seems awkward.  Android wins here.Downloading:  No contest here.  Android wins.  You can download anything to an Android tablet, including video and audio in multiple formats.  Android supports torrent downloading, too.  What can you download to iPad?  iTunes apps, music, and video, all of which come at a price.Games:  iPad wins.  I just can't see Android competing in this area.  Although I'm not a big mobile-device gamer, so it doesn't really matter to me.Bluetooth connectivity:  iPad supports Apple devices.  Android supports everyone's devices.  Android wins.Apps:  A toss up.  App store wins for number of apps, and for integration with iPad.  Market wins for functionality.  I like ebooks, for example, and have ebooks with Barnes and Noble and Kindle.  But Apple has hamstrung the Nook and Kindle apps buy taking away the ability to download books through the iPad apps.  And there will be no app available through the app store that duplicates any other functionality that would eat iinto Apple's profits.Viewing Videos on your HDTV:  With the purchase of a $5 HDTV cable I can view beautiful, high resolution movies and TV shows on my HDTV with my Viziotab.  With iPad you have to buy Apple TV ($99) and then are limited to iTunes store purchases.  Viziotab is the winner here.In conclusion, I like the iPad for its big, beautiful display and ease of use.  I don't like it for its limitations, like lack of bluetooth connectivity, file management capability, and file format support.  I will keep my iPad to share videos and photos of vacations, and to use if I have to video conference with someone.  Which will probably be never, but at least it's there!  And for the cool apps that I do like.  Not so much for browsing or file management.  If I were to have to choose between the two, I would choose Android simply because it is wide open compared to iPad. If I sit on the couch to surf, I'll use Android because I know there will be no artificial barrier between me and the world wide web.  And if I go on vacation, I will take the Android with me for compatibility reasons.Buying advice: If you're an Apple user already and are immersed in the Apple ecosystem of products and services, compatibility probably is not an issue for you, so I would choose iPad.  If, however, you're not an Apple user I would carefully weigh the compatibility issues.  The iPad effect wears off eventually, and you have to realize the iPad is a device that does some things really well, other things not so well, and a few things not at all.  If those things it does 'not at all' are things you need it to do, then you might be well advised to get one of the Android tablets to better serve your needs.  Or, if you're like me and can afford it, why not get both?", "Date": "October 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best Tablet on the market for now... I'm looking at you google", "Author": "AK529", "ReviewID": "R1WA14IGR0EPJT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The iPad 2 has got to be one the best things I have ever owned. In the start I thought I never \"needed\" just wanted it. But now I cant see myself not living without one. I hardly use my 17inch desktop replacement now. I only use it for certain tasks like downloading files, converting files, heavy typing tasks and pc gaming. I also hardly use my HTC Deire Android smartphone or iPod touch 3rg gen for surfing or apps any more when Im home. After trying many different tablets and reading many reviews and lastly just playing around with the iPad 2, I knew it was the best tablet on the market right now. Yes it does have many drawbacks if you compare it to the other tablets, but the it also has many great things about it and pros greatly outweigh the cons. Coming from an iPod touch i was already familiar with iOS. I also plan on getting an iPhone as my next smart phone. I prefer iOS over android and other operating systems for mobile devices. iOS just works and flows really well. Its really reliable and easy to use. Any body any age can pick an iOS device especially an iPad and just start using it right away, its just that easy. I do really wish the iPad 2 had flash but over time I got used to it. Also there are many work around for watching or using flash on the iPad 2. Their are at least 10 different apps/browsers that will allow you to use flash on your iPad 2. Also over time flash will die. It is a aging format, it drains too much battery and memory and its slow and most of all there's all sorts of security issues with it. I know since I use adobe flash on my htc desrie all the time. Also many websites, I would say as much as 75% of them offer 2 choices html 5 or flash versions of their website. I also wish the iPad 2 had a higher resolution screen. Many of the other android tablets do have a higher resolution. They also have better cameras, more ram and dual speakers. Regarding the screen I havent noticed that the resolution is an issue right now any way all videos, web pages, apps and games look great on it. Also the speaker is gerat even though its just one on the bottom right, its still fairly loud and does the job. In terms of performance I don't find the iPad 2 slow in any way even though it has less ram than the other tablets on the market. Here is where the iPad 2 excels when compared to its competitors: The battery life is just crazy at 10 hours, yes at times I do wish the battery was removable so I could just swap another but its just really long lasting. The iPad 2 is supper light especially when compared to the other tablets or even the previous iPad. At first I found it a little on the heavy side and I do still wish it was a little bit lighter like around 1 pound, which Im sure the next will be. I think there is only one tablet which is lighter than the iPad 2 and that's the samsung galaxy tab 10.1. The iPad 2 has the best app store. It has the most apps, the best quality apps, and the developers make the apps for apple first before android, blackberry or windows 7 phone. Apple also has the largest store to purchase music, music videos, tv shows and movies. You can also rent movies on it. The iPad 2 has the best selection of games out of all the other tablets. Their are tons of games free and paid on the iPad 2. The iPad 2 just like any other product has huge number of third party accessories available for it. Apple has great customer service and a great warranty. I do have to warn you that when I received my iPad 2 in the first week of may. I had purchased it online from appples website and it was shipped to me in 3 weeks directly form the factory in china. I was aware that their maybe a backlight bleeding issue on some iPad 2s. It turns out mine had it and I wouldn't have known if I wasn't on the forums. I went into an apple store and the genius replaced it on the spot. Mind you I did get a refurbished model. But the refurbished replacement was flawless with no backlight bleeding and haven't had any issues with it yet. So I caution you to maybe wait until they say for sure that they have fixed the defect with all iPad 2s and then make the purchased. Or you can make your purchase now and see if you get a defective one or not. Overall I am very happy with my iPad 2. I do suggest going for highest memory option you can afford especially if your gonna use it for more than just browsing and email. The apps and games do add app and its always nice to have that extra storage available. Also if you can afford the extra $100 for the 3G connectivity I do suggest that also. That is one feature I wish I had got. I seem to use my iPad 2 mostly at home but when I'm out I do wish I have the 3G since I have to use my smartphone as a hotspot and use up its battery and data. If you get the one with 3G you can always just sign up for no contract data and just turn the plan on and off whenever you really need it with no commitments. Lastly, the iPad 2 does have the antenna gate issue which lowers the signal of the data connection of the device when holding it a certain way. I disappointed to hear this, but its seems these days almost any mobile device has some sort of issue like this. I have noticed it on my 2 ipod touchs and htc desire and now the iPad 2. It happens when you hold down on the speaker grill on the bottom left of the iPad 2. I have noticed it only drops the signal by one bar. So if I have 3 bars on wifi then it drops 2 bars. It there is only one bar then it doesn't drop the connection. I have also done a speed test and it slows down the speed by about one third. It never seems to affect streaming video or music for me. The iPad 2 is a great device I don't regret buying it all. I could just bought a cheap netbook but I a tablet. I was never even a fan of the iPad when it first came out, I thought it was just an over sized iPod touch which I already had. Also I was never a big follower of apple products, yes, I have owned a couple of iPod touchs but that's about it. I was also never a fan of the iPhone just found it over rated. But now after owning the iPad 2 for almost 3 months I can honestly say it is the coolest thing I have ever owned.December 2011 update: Well after owning the iPad 2 for about 7 months I can say its a great device but not good enough. The iOS 5 update made this worse in many ways especially battery life. The device is also more buggy now. Alot of the new features work but dont work right or all the time. I did update to 5.01 and battery life as improved but not to what it was before 5.0. I am anxiously awaiting a worthy tablet from google. The lack of flash, not having real multitasking, not being able to modify or customize my tablet in any way, not having micro sd card or usb ports really makes me wanna get an android based tablet. As soon as there is an android tablet that is just as good as the iPad 2 or better I will be getting it and selling this iPad 2. In the mean time I guess I will have to just deal with the limitations of an iOS device. Jailbreaking my iPad 2 did improve the usability of it alot but then I updated to iOS 5 and I no longer have a jailbreak. Jailbreaking still doesn't compare to the hack-ability and customization an android device is capable of especially if rooted.April 2012 update: aftering owning my iPad 2 for almost a year now I am still very happy with it. When I first wrote my review I thought maybe the an android tablet would be better for me. Since then I tried the asus transformer prime and found out the grass is not greener on the other side. The asus prime was buggy, had all sort of glitches. I wasn't happy with the hardware or software especially after using an iPad. The lack of tablet specific apps was also very limited. The only thing I miss from the prime was the keyboard dock which provided extra battery life, extra ports and a hardware keyboard. There is still nothing like this for the iPad. All the keyboards are Bluetooth and end up draining the iPads battery quicker. There is the apple keyboard dock but only works in portrait mode and can only be used on desk or flat surface.The iPad 2 is even better than before now since the price has been reduced to $400 and you can get a refurb unit for only $350. Personally I think the refurb should be $300. But $350 is still a great price and ofcourse people will still buy it at that price. I don't really see a point in upgrading to the newer iPad. I played around with it in the store and yes it did look better but only when you put the two of them next to each other. They say only people who use their iPad for videos and gaming will really benefit from the better screen. The newer screen is also suppose to reduce eye strain for reading.  The iPad is still the best tablet on the market and will continue to be so for a while at least until google finally gets their act together and produce a comparable tablet.  Androids lack of tablet apps and fragmentation is really killing and holding google back from competing with Apple.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "A warning about where to purchase an ipad 3G", "Author": "Denny", "ReviewID": "R3B4UDIYMEUZLR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "If you buy from Apple, the 3G is either $15 or $25 per month as the SIM is included, but if you buy the ipad with 3G from anyone else, you must go get the microSIM card from either ATT or Verizon depending on what model ipad you purchased.

I paid full price for my 64gb iPad and I don't regret it, even as long as it took me to save up for it.  I love getting digital copies of movies (like from the bluray discs you were already going to buy) and putting them on this bad boy to take wherever I want.  Not only can I enjoy it, but with an AV adapter cord I can plug it up to any HDTV and entertain everyone.Obviously the apps are awesome.  There practically is an app for everything.  My biggest consideration in getting the iPad over an ereader was the amount of books you have access to.  On an iPad, you have access to all the iBooks, Kobo books, B&N; nook books, and amazon kindle books through their own app.  Just recently I found one negative thing about having an iPad over a kindle.  I'm not talking about the fire either, because I really don't know enough about the fire to compare point for point, I'm just talking ebooks here.  The Kindle lets you borrow one book a month I believe it is for free (the kindle version ones that are listed as $0.00) if you are an amazon prime member.  Until recently, I wasn't a prime member and I wasn't disappointed until I found out that the iPad app for kindle doesn't offer the free borrowing of books unless you have an actual kindle. This may change some day if enough people complain, but as of right now, it isn't offered.  So if you are fine with paying for all of your books or you aren't willing to pay to be a prime member, then you have access to more books on an ipad.  Oh another cool thing is that you can download the overdrive app which you can rent digital books or audiobooks from your local library with your library card for free.  I love the audiobooks because I'm sure you know how expensive they are to buy, and unless I know for sure its a good book, I'm not willing to drop $20-$45 on an audiobook.As for the internet on the iPad, browsing is a breeze, saving pages and bookmarking is a breeze.  The only thing is it does have some problems connecting to little mom and pop wif signals for some reason.  Its a known problem and I imagine the iPad3 will be better at this.  Other than that there are no complaints from me for the internet.Printing from the iPad is so cool, too.  Even if you don't have an airprint printer, you can still find an app to print to almost any printer through wifi.  I haven't found one yet that I couldn't print on using Print Bureau.  Its really cool and after you figure out how to use it, its pretty simple too.  I can even print to my huge commercial printer/scanner/network fax machine at work.I also love the adapters for cameras that lets you easily plug and transfer pictures/video directly to the iPad to send or post somewhere online.If you have an iPod or iPhone, the charger that comes with the iPad is much stronger, and charges your other apple idevices much faster than with the chargers that came with them.Overall very happy with my purchase!!!I wanted to add an update, my schoolwork is online and I did find a way around the adobe flash problem so that I can access all of my school assignments and take tests from my iPad.

But I used it for reading books and watching movies, and slowly found myself using it for more and more things, until eventually it replaced my laptop (which, with my netbook, now sits collecting dust most of the time). Between my iPad and my desktop computer, they cover just about everything I need or want a computer for. As a result, I can't see myself buying another laptop, ever. (Or perhaps I will buy one some day as a more mobile replacement for my desktop.)When Apple brought out the \"retina\" iPad, they also dropped the price on the iPad 2, and I bought an Apple-refurbished iPad 2 as an upgrade for my first-gen iPad. But this time, I stuck with wifi-only, since the AT&T; 3G was (and is) marginal in my neighborhood, and went with the bottom-end 16GB version because I had never used more than 12 GB of storage on the original iPad.For three-fifty plus tax and free shipping, the refurb iPad 2 is a ridiculously good deal. Apple replaces the battery and metal shell--the parts most likely to be damaged or worn out--when they refurbish iPads.  I honestly can't tell that mine is a refurb. It looks and acts like it is brand new.The iPad 2 is significantly faster than the original, which I notice mostly while browsing the web, but also with some games. It's lighter, and the battery lasts almost as long. Apple keeps adding features to iOS, so the iPad continues to become more useful. (Thank you, Google, for keeping Apple on their toes.)I look forward to upgrading to a refurbished  \"retina\" iPad when Apple brings out the next generation.

I have researched for quite a long time before I bought my Prime (since returned) and actually had THREE Android tablets that all just did not cut it for me.  If you are on a lower budget, than certainly there are MANY Android tablets out there.  If you have the funds, I highly recommend the Apple iPad 2 as it is about the the best \"overall\" tablet out there.  Whether you like Apple or Steve Jobs history or politics, the iPad 2 really is a quality machine.  Nothing is perfect, and nothing will please everybody, but in comparing devices, I now have the experience with both platforms and will pick iPad as the best of the two.  For the average user, that being the non-technical, non-programmer type, and the person NOT looking for a tablet to replace a PC or laptop, the iPad 2 is a wonder.  Yes, it sure has different operating system and is \"closed\" compared to Android.  Yes, it does not support Java or Flash, but these are small issues. If you MUST have Java or Flash, or \"hate\" Apple, then no matter what anybody says, you will not like any reviews of the iPad 2.  If you are a regular \"Joe\" or \"Janet\", then read carefully all of the reviews and see that the iPad is a great unit if you can afford the extra dollars.  In a few weeks, the iPad 3 is likely announced and the prices for the remaining iPad 2's will likely decreases.  When that happens grab one immediately.  Of course, if you have the money, might want to consider the iPad 3.  People seem to get personal about an Apple product, either love them or hate them.  I have no bias, I own an Android Phone and will likely keep it.  I own an Ipod Touch and will probably keep it.  Since I have an Ipod and have had one for years (since they came out) I am familiar with iTunes and the iTunes Store.  If you are one of these people, you will find the interface of the iPad 2 familiar to you. Almost every application I used on the iPad 2 (my wifes) as compared to the Android devices was better.  Yahoo and SKYPE Video chat was far superior.  I did not use the camera on the iPad 2, but then again, a camera on a tablet is of NO importance to me.  Ease of use and quality are, and I choose (now) the iPad 2.  I simply like the Apple OS on a tablet better than Android. A huge difference I found with the iPad 2 over Android, is that with the default Android Sync program, I could not SEND an email from my exchange.  I could RECEIVE only.  After finding this out, and searching online, it is common issue and you need to download a third party SYNC program to accomplish this.  The iPad 2 works flawlessly out of the box sending and receiving exchange emails. I almost bought an iPad 2 in the beginning, and after three different Android units, am certainly going to purchase the iPad (2 or 3).  Things might just work out better anyway now, that a new iPad will be announced shortly.*****update: I did purchase an iPad 2 on March 7 after the price was lowered by $100. I can safely state again that this is a fabulous device and I highly recommend. If you want a quality built tablet that can do pretty much all you would need, see if you can pick up an iPad 2 32 or 64 gb one before they are all gone.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "I love it more every day...", "Author": "S and K Reviews", "ReviewID": "R3NFBIXHJY4UMN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was my first Apple purchase.

The lack of Flash is really a problem because there are still many sites that use Flash technology. Really, really annoying.Although printing is only possible with a select few Canon printers, I am not going out of my way to purchase a Canon printer just so I can print from my iPad.The GOOD stuff:The really great thing about this device is when you turn it on, Bam!  It's on.  No wait time, no boot up time.iPad vs Kindle.Initially I bought the iPad as an e-reader because the experience is much superior when compared to the Kindle.  The touch screen is much more book like, turning pages with your finger is much more intuitive than pushing a button.  The scrubber at the bottom of the page so you can slide to any page, where as the Kindle you have to push a button or use the \"go to\" function and type in the desired page.  iPad lets you know what page and chapter name you're on rather than just a percent, the Kindle gives no chapter name or page number.  Every issue the Kindle has is addressed with the iPad.  The color screen is much better than the Kindle e-ink screen.***********************3G and GPS Chip.I am very glad I have these options.  When ever you want access the internet in remote areas via 3G, just go the \"settings\", cellular data and log in and turn on that option.  So for the next 30 days at $15 you have internet access.The GPS chip is included with the 3G.  There are GPS apps for free, Waze and Motion X GPS Drive for purchase.  With the 3G option you need to turn on the Cellular Data in order for the GPS to work.Waze app is free and is pretty accurate but it did give me incorrect directions but it can only get better since the information is user generated.  Just driving around with Waze turned on generates information for other drivers.  It has voice guidance but does not give specific street names.  It is good in showing road conditions, traffic, hazards, etc....Motion X Drive app is 99 cents and just as good or better than Garmin.  It has many options and gives two different female voices for guidance, nothing really sexy.  It also states the street names but must be purchased for either $3 for 30 days or $20 for one year.  It also gives road conditions but Waze probably does a better job.***********************FaceTimeThe Jetsons technology is here.

I find the ipad too heavy to hold when reading. Perhaps that can't be helped. It certainly is not heavy in the real sense of the word. It's easy to carry with you anywhere. But to hold it upright for long periods like you do the Kindle is not what it was made for. So, I read my books on the Kindle.That aside, I used to think the iPad was an expensive toy. I was wrong. I use it for my business and investments and have yet to play a game on it. I get streaming quotes and financial news and instant updates. Apple has so many apps that you'll find exactly what you want. I have lots of fitness and exercise apps that help me keep my health in check.Lots of people have written in-depth reviews on the iPad and I'm not going to try and do the same thing. I merely want to say that this is a powerful device that can put power in your hands and add a lot to your business and personal life.Apple support is decent but you can't get refunds for apps you don't like or that don't work for you. That's a major con and very much unlike Amazon. Also, Apple's site --- iTunes --- is hard to navigate. But those are the only cons I've found thus far.A word of advice: While 16gb is a considerable amount of space for books, etc, you may regret not getting more memory. I do. Just the apps alone (if you buy a lot of them as I did and most people do) take up lots of space. And video uses lots of memory. I didn't think I'd keep many videos on my iPad but I do. I'm now using about three-forths of my memory and I've only had the device about a month or less. I can assure you that next time I'll spend a bit more and buy more memory and you might want to consider that as well.Highly recommended.- Susanna K.

My husband had just purchased a computer for me as a birthday gift coincidentally, and it had a hard drive failure the 3rd time it booted up.  So we returned it and bought a second iPad 2 for me.  We are completely addicted.  They are so user friendly, work well, and are instant on and off (instead of waiting forever to boot up and shut down like a computer).  We both absolutely love them.You iPad may not have the latest operating system on it since many have been sitting in stores waiting to be sold.  If it has 4.3.5 or older, then you simply can take it to a Verizon store and have them activate it at no charge.  They are an official Apple Store.If you need to update your iPad 2 to the new IOS 5 that is to be released in October 2011, then I have some tips, to possibly prevent a lot of grief. HOWEVER, you can just skip all the rest of the technical part of my review if you pay a small fee to have operating system IOS 5 downloaded onto your new iPad 2 so that it is completely independent of a regular computer and iTunes. This is a huge step that Apple has been developing for awhile now.  I don't know if Verizon will do it for free, but Best Buy will do it for $29.95.  If you go to Verizon, make sure the employee is quite familiar with activating the iPad, etc.  Our local Verizon person acted like she knew, but when I brought it home, it wasn't activated.  That's why I had to go through all this stuff so I could do it on my own computer.The current operating system as of today requires hook up to a computer that has iTunes on it.  The new \"IOS 5\" is due to come out in the next 10-15 days, between October 10-15, 2011.  Anyone who buys an iPad 2 that already has IOS 5 loaded and, also, anyone who already owns an ipad 2 who updates to this version; will be able to do everything without being dependent upon a computer and iTunes.  Right now, you upload photos, your own music, and download and install updates via your computer using iTunes on a regular computer. You can load these things by emailing to your iPad from your computer where they are stored, but if you have a lot, it is easier to transfer via iTunes on your computer.My review is long and some is very technical.  You can stop here if I've already given you helpful info you wanted to know.  The very next section is about some apps I recommend and then after that is the very technical part that isn't necessary if you don't have a computer or want to take my suggestion and pay to have IOS 5 installed on your iPad.------Before I get on with the heavy-duty technical part that you may or may not want read, let me recommend a few apps that you can purchased inexpensively.  Part of the fun is customizing your iPad with apps that you enjoy or help you with your tasks:1. A free app for the iPad is \"Goodreader.\"  This is a great app.  You can view about any format of a file in this app, even Excel files.  You can also make annotations with various symbols and highlighting that the program offers.  You can also unzip a zip file in Goodreader.  I've never done it, but you can watch a video in that app as well.  It has a great folder and file management system that is easy.  I believe you can even bring in files to your iPad from your computer via wi-fi or ftp.  You can also save a web page for reading off line when you are not near wi-fi, such as on an airplane.  I really like this program.2.  If you like to use Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel, you can get these apps, but they are $20 each.  I have two excel spreadsheets that I like to keep up on a daily or weekly basis.  One, for example, are our household expenditures and deposits.  Since Goodreader doesn't let you actually add to a Word document or Excel file, I found a program called \"Office 2 HD.\"  This one is not free.  It is a $6.99 program plus fee and tax, but that is less than you pay for either Word or Excel.  It's pretty easy.  What I did was email to myself my Excel file from my computer.  I opened the email in iPad 2 and clicked on the attached file.  Then I tapped on the little curved arrow that you would tap if you want to reply to or forward an email and it gave me the option of opening the file in either Goodreader or Office 2 HD.  I selected Office 2 HD.  Then I opened that app, opened that file, and tapped the Save button.  The Save button gives you a choice of Save or Save As.  When you want to be able to type in the file, you choose Save As and rename it.  If you don't want to rename the file, than add a \"1\" to the file name on your computer before you email it to yourself on iPad; and then when you Save As, just delete the 1.  Easy.  Of course, it works differently inserting rows, etc., than a regular spreadsheet of Excel program, so you really do need to refer to their help menu.  I like the program though, because it is inexpensive and lets me keep up edit my favorite already existing spreadsheets.  You can create new ones also, of course.  I haven't used the word processor yet, but it is probably even easier than a spreadsheet.  Oh, it has a Power Point type program in it also.3.  Right now the default Safari brower on the iPad isn't very good.  I'm very spoiled to using tabs so I can open search listings in a new tab without losing my search page or use the tabs to go back and forth comparing info on two or three different web pages.  The new IOS 5 is giving Safari tabs.  However, I really like \"Web Perfect Browser\" which is only $3.99 plus fee and tax.  Not only does it provide a tab system for browsing, but will also save web pages for offline reading.  I save a web page in the Browser if it is something I want to read later, but not necessarily save.  I save a web page in Goodreader, if I want to keep it for reference.  I don't know all the changes they are going to make in Safari.  You might go ahead and check it all out before buying Web Perfect Browser in case it is good enough for your purposes.4.  A great picture organizer program is \"Photo Mgr Pro.\"  Once again, the new IOS 5 is making big improvements on the default photo.  Perhaps you won't even need this app.  The current default Photo app is terrible.  You cannot put them in the order you want.  As far as I know, the only way to create Albums (folders) is to arrange the folders you want in a special iPad folder on your computer first and then upload the special folder and its contents to the iPad through iTunes.  You still can't arrange the order, however.  I know they have made improvements in the new operating system; but if you don't like it, try the Photo Mgr Pro.  It's good.By the way, the final price of an app varies because some are Apple apps and some are 3rd-Party developers.  The developers do get a fee from each purchase.  All apps have tax added.  I'm not sure how this works, but I do notice that the difference between the app purchase price and the final price is not always the same percentage.  However, apps are so reasonably priced, it just isn't that important.  Just know that when it says $3.99, it actually will be a little more.---------THE TECHNICAL PART OF MY REVIEW REGARDING PROBLEMS UPDATING OR INSTALLING ITUNES:It isn't a big deal using your computer and iTunes (if you have a computer) unless you have the following problems that I ran into.  Here are a couple of solutions below.DON'T LET MY INSTRUCTIONS SCARE YOU.  REMEMBER, you can just have IOS 5 put on it after its released, and you don't have to deal with any of this. By the way, if you don't have a computer, you can take the iPad to a Verizon store to activate it. They don't charge for it since they are contracted by Apple. Best Buy may also do it for a small fee when you don't buy it there.  Best Buy will also download and install updates for you for $29.95, so wait until the new IOS 5.0 is released and have them put that one on it.  That eliminates the computer and iTunes problem since you will be able update and download from the iPad. (I'm repeating, but knowing how to do this with ease and avoiding the problems is valuable to know.)Now back to the iTunes problem.  NOTE:  My instructions are for a PC with XP. It is possible you won't be able to install the latest version of iTunes.  You need a version later than the 9.0 and above series.  It must start with a 10.0 or later for it to be connected to your ipad.  I use version 10.4.1.  I discovered that since I apparently had some previous version of iTunes and/or Quick Time on my computer, it left behind some kind of language.  Therefore, after I downloaded itunes version 10.4.1 and attempted to install it; it appeared to install, but wouldn't open.  An error message appeared saying there were missing files.  After spending 3 days researching off and on for the solution and trying to reinstall etc., I finally found a document on the Internet stating exactly what to remove and how to do it. INSTRUCTIONS: From the PC via Add and Remove Programs in the Control Panel remove iTunes.  Then you remove Apple Application Support.  You don't have to uninstall Quick Time.  Then you close and reboot.  Don't open any programs, but do shutdown firewall and anti-virus programs and turn off your DSL/broadband.  Now you can go to your iTunes install file you saved and install it. Now it will work, or it may say something about Mobile Device Service not started. If so, open Control Panel again and open Administrative Tools.  Open the \"Services\" folder. Click ONCE on Apple Mobile Device folder.  To the left of the file, it says \"Stop the Service\" and \"Start the Service.\"  Click on \"Stop the Service\" and then click on \"Start the Service.\"  I can't remember if you reboot again, but it will tell you. After this, iTunes, should work just fine unless some other cause is creating your problem.NEXT PROBLEM that many people are having is that iTunes will perform all the functions for your iPad except it won't download an OS (Operating System) Update.  It will act like it's downloading, but eventually times out.  I have a solution, but you can confirm that your problem is the same as mine by doing the following:  Open iTunes and click on Help on the menu.  Select \"Run Diagnostics\".  Uncheck everything except the first line to do a Connectivity Test. Make sure your DSL or wi-fi is connected. Click Next. Click Next again and it will list test results.  The first two lines will have green dots, meaning ok.  The third line will be red, \"Secure Link to iTunes Store Failed.\"  What is peculiar about this is that I can purchase an app through the store, but can't download an update.  The problem is somewhere in conflicting language or programs.  After 3 more days of trying to fix, it I finally found a webpage that lists direct links to Apple and instructions.  You choose your particular kind of iPad; for example, iPad 2 wi-fi only.  Then you download the file and save it to a folder where you won't forget where it is.  Be aware that is is a 690 MG file!  It takes hours to download.  I have DSL \"light\" which means it is slower than regular hi-speed, so it took my file 8 hours to download. Make sure your Power settings say never so the computer won't sleep during the download.  It's ok if your monitor sleeps or the desk top activates a screen saver. By the way, I also was not able to download it on my computer than has iTunes.  I had to use my very old computer that has never had iTunes on it.  My itunes computer blocked downloads even directly from Apple!  If you don't have another computer, use someone else's computer that doesn't have iTunes. OR just wait for IOS 5 (release in Oct. 2011) and pay Best Buy $29.95 to download it and install! After downloading it, I put it on a flash drive and transferred it to my other computer that has iTunes.  Next, plug in iPad to your computer via the cable included; do this BEFORE opening iTunes.  If you haven't already activated your new iPad 2, then you will be activating it now through iTunes.  Once it is activated, you are ready to install the update you downloaded, which will IOS 5 after it released. iTunes may pop up a window that asks if you want to download the update.  Press Cancel.  If it is set up to automatically download it, press the X next to the field at the top where it is showing that is is downloading.  That will stop it.  NOW, since your iTunes will not work for downloading if you have the same connectivity issue that I do, you will HOLD DOWN your shift key WHILE you press the UPDATE button.  You will only see the UPDATE button if you plugged in your ipad first to your computer and then open iTunes.  A menu just for your iPad will appear across the middle of the screen and the Update button is on the Summary tab.  After you hold down the shift key while clicking on Update, it will pop up a screen allowing you to find your downloaded file.  If you computer downloaded it as a ZIP file, you'll have to unzip it first and then choose the file.  iTunes will now update your iPad with the new update.  It takes about 10 min or less.  By the way, I have Opera browser on my old computer and discovered that it doesn't force a zip file as some browsers do.  It will download the file as it actually comes with the correct file extension.Hope this review doesn't scare you off.  Remember!  You don't have to deal with any of these problems if you pay a store that is set up for iPads to download the new IOS 5 operating system which makes iPad completely independent of a separate computer and iTunes.  Again, I don't know what Verizon would charge, but $29.95 is pretty good at Best Buy.  Call first to make sure the stores near you will do it.Have fun with Ipad 2.  It's great!  I'm quite advanced on PC's as I used them for the last 15 years for my jobs.

I should have done this to see if it was compatable, but by the time I figured this out I had already invested so much time getting this to work right and had had enuf.3) Similarly, i would have to purchase a stylus to see if I could find one that worked for me. I'm used to using wrist movments and finger movements to work for long periods of time - not upper arm movements - so I would have to use a stylus. was not prepared cause I thought my styluses I already have would work on the IPAD4) Worst onscreen keyboard I have ever used. You have to hit a seperate key to make numbers and symbols like @ appear, and then hit the key again to return to letters. Perhaps i'd get used to this, perhaps not. so for, not.5) Similarly, if you can't touch type with the keyboard (you can't, I tried) then why space them out so far from one another? or why not let it be modifyable depending on the needs of the user?6) in the app store the print is too tiny. Much to my surprise, I could not expand it in the usual way. I did not bother to see if there was another way to expand it7) there's something dizzying about the way it switches between screens.8) Apple's official position is that they will not support WIFI conncections that use the older WEP security. Their only advice is to upgrade to WPA which they are happy to help you with excpet they don't care about the problem that then my older two devices would not be able to connect...So if have intermittant trouple with wifi because of WEP, don't count on Apples help. It took me ages to access some firmware to upgrade, only to find that i can't use WPA.9)In the store, the Ipad I tried got so dim as to be practically black. that's what I want for the dim lighting i use it in. My unit does not get as dim as that one. It's probably ok though.10) The final straw was an irrational one I guess...I decided to take a break from figuring things out and watch some stuff from NBC. I had not realized NBC does not support IPAD. the shows are on hulu but why shyould I pay 8 bucks a month when I can watch for free on my laptop. Other people have commented that they are going to start watching more ABC. I would rather find a table that lets me watch what I want.11)and ok, one more, i would also like to upload files to a speciality website, but didn't check to see if there's an app for that...12) I hate all the going thru ITUNES, a behmoth that now sits on my laptop, though i'd probably get used to this.Overall, Apple is really great at creating problems and then offering to sell you an App for that (no usb, no Word, no excel, can't upload or download files etc.).

When iPad 2 came out, I thought it was a nice evolutionary step, but not enough for me to upgrade.However, the seemingly small changes do turn out to make a difference.  For example, one of my favorite uses of the original iPad was to read various newspapers and blogs while having breakfast. That worked pretty well, but the limited memory of the original iPad caused web-pages to rarely be cached: Following a link and then hitting the \"back\" button felt a bit sluggish. With iPad 2, this scenario works a lot better. Similarly, FaceTime and video Skype support were attractive to me, but I figured that having an iPhone 4 already would largely mitigate the advantage of having the feature also on iPad.  Well, the larger size of iPad 2 makes it much more natural to have my daughter join alongside of me in a conversation with overseas family members. The small weight and dimension differences also have a disproportional effect. My kids use a drawing app that also seems to benefit from the added hardware capabilities (memory-bound, I think) and GarageBand is even more impressive on iPad 2 than its already remarkable power on my original iPad.I had a chance to try some other tablets (Xoom, 7\" Samsung, and Nook color), but at this time they're far behind iPad in just about every respect (the Nook color's low weight is nice though). The Xoom's screen has odd dimension when web-browsing or reading (it's nice when watching certain movies, but the experience improvement is small compared to the the reduced experience for most other applications, including non-wide-format videos).

It does a lot more than just eBooks.In turn, she got me an iPad, since I like tech toys and have been a long-time Apple and iTunes user. I worked for hours to get the iPad to do simple things like synch my music with no luck.Apple is now so intent on push marketing, like the Genius function in iTunes, that it interferes with basic functionality.I also couldn't get it to connect to my MobileMe account- apparently Apple sets up new iPads up so you cannot access MobileMe even if you have an account.The \"Genius Bar\" at the local Apple Store in Reston - which has traditionally been a good resource the few times I needed it - could not help and was manned by people who didn't care and who knew less about the software and devices than I did. They were also rude to my daughter on a visit. So I went with her the next time and got the same poor treatment and not a single problem on my list fixed.Apple is having a lot of success, but I'm concerned they may also be getting arrogant.If you are considering an iPad - beware it may be a time-sink.

It also has some awesome word processing apps, so if I do need to type something, I can do so with ease, even using a touch screen. It's so nice to be able to pull this out of my bag and have instant Internet access with an amazing screen wherever I am. I have the 32GB version with wi-fi, and have plenty of space to store movies, music, apps, whatever. My iPad is with me wherever I go.

So I was looking for the same experience in a tablet, and mostly because of Android being open and the fact that I may be able to apply custom roms, etc. After researching a lot, months ago I found the Androids tablet to be superior, or so I thought, to the iPad. Thats because I compared the hardware specs, usb support, etc. So I bought an Archos tablet first and then a GTab. But to be honest, the experience was never fluid or at least not near to what I was used in my phone. The UI is very laggy and there are too many bugs still. After a while I couldnt stand it anymore and I sold them. I think the problem is the software, Android, which is evolving and is still not ready for primetime, though I do think it will be sometime given the currnt trend.So I decided to give the iPad a try. And it was worth it. The experience of this product is amazing, everything is crisp and fluid, even with less hardware than the Android ones. There's just no way to compare the OS in this regard. The iPad offers the best experience for a tablet today. If you don't believe me go and try one for at least 30 mins. I know that Apple is closed and all of those things I also hate, but still, the experience of using this device is so amazing it outweights other purely inellectual aspects, at least for me it does.If you want a tablet that is fluid, reliable and just works, buy the iPad. Even the iPad 1 will do. If you want to play with roms and don't mind the bugs and UI freezes and basically don't mind spending time debugging usability issues, buy and Android tablet for the nice things like USB integration and openess.For now I'll stick to Android for phones and to Apple for tablets.

VonCamper", "ReviewID": "R2LAI9RDEW7FTF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "(Caveat: I'm not a techie dude (though I do enjoy some techno music... go figure, right?) so proceed cautiously with my review...)I've been brought to the iPad dragging my heels, kicking and screaming, like a bratty toddler told to eat his peas (I hate peas).My history: I've not been a fan of the proprietary and I love music.  Some years ago, before my kids bought an iPod... I owned a Creative Zen Vision M MP3 player... 60 gigs that thing carried... and I could download whatever I wanted into it... no proprietary poo and nobody needed to know my financial information or address, and I loved that lil device for that freedom.  Creative created a great product, and in fact they own a couple of patents that enable certain Apple products to work, but like Beta recording tape... a technology that was superior to VHS, yet it was popularity of the lessor product that eventually killed the chances of the better device ever really taking hold.  Similarly, from a freedom point of view.. seems like much of the MP3 market has gone the way of the dinosaur, losing out to the proprietary Apple name.  And so begins my review.To recap: I hate proprietary.  And Apple IS that: proprietary.  Having said this, and yielding to my better senses, I have made allowance to bend towards the Apple by initially purchasing my iPhone.  I still hate the proprietary... love the device; Apple, begrudgingly liked by me for the things they build, made such a great device in the iPhone that I decided to take the leap by swallowing the whole schtick and bought this iPad.This second generation, 16 gig, iPad purchase was a big one for our family... actually, for my wife (as a birthday present to her), and she's been tethered to it for two days... loves it.It's a nice sized tablet... much easier to surf the internet with a larger screen than that of an iPhone, so that's a nice plus.  As for their proprietary... if you move to Apple with the purchase of your own iPad, you'll have to give them information... personal information, to include credit card, and normally that's enough to stop me in my tracks, so if you're like me and don't easily want to part with giving this info out... this isn't the tablet for you.  But before you consider not buying this tablet for that reason, remember that once you do give in, you're introduced to a world of great products and support.As far as functionability... this iPad is basically a picture/video taking wi-fi accessing internet surfing tool (nice run-on).  Conceptually, the tablet is intuitive in it's function... if you already own an iPod/iPhone/iPad.... yet if you don't, navigation/use of this tablet is pretty easy to learn... easier still if you have someone that owns one helping you for the first 2 mins.What makes this device interesting is the ability to add applications (apps) that enable you to do a millions things with this device.  Some apps are free while some cost money... and they're found once you hit the \"App Store\" icon on your device.My iPad was purchased with the wi-fi connectibility option only; I wasn't interested in purchasing (another...) 3g AT&T; smart device usage fee, though it's an option (another model...).  As for internet connectibility, I just have to find a wi-fi site and wahla... connection, at no extra cost to me.  Sure, this doesn't make the tablet very usable while in motion, but that's not a big deal for my usage intent... so this really doesn't effect me as it would someone who's occupation relies on such mobility usage (did that make sense?  Hope so...).This tablet comes with 16 gigs of memory (same as my phone...); I have hundreds of photos and some video on my phone, but no music.  If you have an ample music collection you would like to carry/keep on this iPad, I might suggest you purchase one with a higher storage capability.  This iPad will be used by my wife and she's going to stick pictures on it, perhaps SOME music, but not much between the two; for her, 16 gigs is just right.As for other functions: it's got a camera (don't ask me for specs... look them up.  New generation iPads have newer iris'/greater photo capabilities), that can also take video.  I can do a video type conferencing with another Apple device (another iPhone/iPad, for example)... it's called \"facetime\"... that's a neat feature that my 4 year old loves when I'm at work for two days or more at a time.  Battery life seems good... charging is a snap; USB or wall... you can do both with hardware supplied.Importantly, and to their credit... Apple does a great job supporting their products (my experience with a problematic iPhone, handled by Apple Care... was top-notch).  They take care of warrantied items very well.  An additional note: Apple stores, if you 've got one close-by... are a great resource for handling warranty/problematic software issues... so the support for the product, in-store or not, is there.As for iPads or tablets in general... there are others, but even this second generation iPad makes internet connection, and use, a breeze.  After owning now... two devices, I'm a believer in the products that Apple (thus far...) have made... and though I STILL don't dig the proprietary thing, it's a reasonable trade-off for being able to use a pretty great device.I hope this review assists you in making your choice, whichever that choice may be.

Life is better now that I own one. With all the hype about it though I really expected it to be slightly better than it is.  It's hard to rate this exactly 3 or 4 stars so I'd rank it closer to four. Below summarizes why.PROs:It's amazingly fast.Amazing battery life and the exact battery remaining percentage icon is a great feature instead of the usual cellphone-like icon showing a quarter, half, etc. Battery life is really one of the best things about it.It turns on instantly and is ready for anything. Shuts down and sleeps just as quick. You almost never have to shut it down to undo a lockup. Notice I said \"almost\".Loads websites fast, and almost all apps work problem-free.Tons of content available, much of it free or just $.99Built well and damn-near bulletproof case. It looks sleek and you don't want to put it down once you start using it.It's lightweight and I don't notice it getting hot. So much more pleasant to use on the couch than a laptop. If you haven't spent an evening browsing the net from your couch with the iPad, you don't know what you're missing.CONs:Sadly the cons are quite significant in my mind. Doesn't mean I'm taking it back but kind of amazing that Apple didn't address this with the ipad2. First, the lack of flash support on the iPad is HIGHLY ANNOYING.  I cannot overstate this. I have read many reviews and talked to enough fan-boys that tell me flash is outdated and isn't going to be used much longer, HTML 5 will replace it, on and on. To that I say YEAH RIGHT.  Flash is everywhere. Many major corporations and product companies use flash on their sites. If you cant run it, you WILL miss out on content. I had no idea how big this was until i got an ipad.If you use amazon you need flash. Otherwise forget watching any product videos. To have to move to a desktop because my tablet won't do flash is unacceptable. I have heard that apple chose not to allow it due to battery life issues, but this doesn't seem like a valid enough point. It's probably more than this: political between adobe and apple. Here's a newsFLASH: how about just giving us the option to turn flash browsing off if battery life is the real reason? Maybe I'd rather have four hrs of battery life and be able to watch video than have 10 hrs of battery. This is the most glaring problem with the iPad and if you are in the market for a tablet, do your comparison shopping and check the android tablets before you decide. Wish I had. This is a problem I encounter almost every day.Lack of a back button-there is not always a way to 'back out' of an application on the ipad as there is with other tablets, again namely the android tablets. Sometimes you get knee deep in an application and hit a wall, the only way out is to hit the home bezel button which means you have to close and  start the app over. With other tablets you just go back one step.  Not a huge annoyance, but annoying nonetheless and probably happens every other day or so.Text ain't that sharp-I thought for sure owning an iPad I'd have razor sharp text just like the razor sharp graphics on the rest of the unit. Not so. Text is just 'ok'.  I just find myself having to blow things up sometime to view them clearly, and I have good vision. This may be a little knit picky... Text is fairly sharp as you enlarge and stretch content. I have read some other reviews touting sharper text on competing tablets though.Safari ain't that great either-safari is extremely limited and again apple won't let you have Firefox for the iPad. Basically I think safari provides a far less pleasing browsing experience. My main gripe is that safari will not 'wordwrap'. This means when you zoom in on a web pages the article will stroll horizontally which means extra work to have to read it. (Your home computer will wrap the text automatically, meaning the article or web page way get longer in length, but stays  only one screen length in width.... This makes for an easier reading experience).If you do lots of reading online this can get tiring constantly having to scroll horizontally as well as vertically without word wrap. This isn't a problem on the kindle fire and android phones, I presume it isn't a problem on their tablets, either.The war against Google-it's no secret apple and Google will one day be even more of direct competitors than they are now, and I find that gmail sometimes just will not open on the iPad. It hangs up and locks up the unit, and I mean LOCKS UP the unit rendering the rest of safari useless until I can get it to calm down and close out.  I have no idea why but gmail is the only website that gives me a problem in safari. It's annoying and I feel unnecessary.  it's not my Internet and not my WiFi either because it works on every other computer and device in the house.  There is a gmail app, but I share the tablet with other people and kids and I want my email access separately in a browser. Sadly gmail and the iPad don't mix and that sucks.SUMMARY:Despite the gripes above the iPad is still a marvelous machine, albeit not perfect. It's loads better than using a laptop for daily surf and email. You probably won't regret buying one, and if you do the high resale value means you'll have not problem unloading it. If you are a Google or android user, you do owe it to yourself to check out the android tablets side by side before making a purchase. I can tell you for sure that for browsing the net and reading articles, Google's android built in browser is loads better than safari.  I think the iPad had been incorrectly assumed as being vastly superior because it's apple, but it has some major flaws.However even with those it is still as a whole a superb machine. It's an amazing piece of technology and far superior for web browsing than a computer or laptop. Just a personal tip--if you're on the fence about what color to get, go with white. Black is cool too, but white will stay looking cleaner (black shows every fingerprint) and will not show little nicks and scratches on the case like black will.Thanks for reading.", "Date": "July 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "thought I was buying new product", "Author": "edsnpw", "ReviewID": "R33LNBFFDXLG3Q", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was in the process of purchasing 26 iPad 2s over a period of 3 months for my employer when Apple switched to the new model and stopped selling the iPad 2 32GB that I need.

Not quite perfect, but good enough for me.", "Author": "Leo Stark", "ReviewID": "R4HF0MLW53MX8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So I got my iPad 2 the first Friday of summer 2011, and have been loving it ever since. I use it for school (I'm practically paperless) and for entertainment. I got the 32 gigabyte model because I store a lot of apps, music, and pictures (from memebase, damn memebase.) With out further ado, here is my full review.Hardware: the hardware for the iPad is great. The aluminum body is sleek, strong, and stylish. I feel very confident in the Apple build quality to withstand most of the things I do. The plastic on the iPad is very little, and still strong. It has your usual 30 pin port on the bottom, which is huge and I don't see why they don't make a smaller one. If you liked charging your iDevice with your computer, tough luck. Only a new MacBook Pro or a new iMac can charge the iPad 2.  I have neither. All in all, I give the hardware an A+.Cases: A case is needed, however. My case is leather, and I got it for the magnetic closure, but for my use, it just isn't sturdy enough. Right now. I'm using rooCASE Dual Station Premium Leather (Magenta) Case Cover with Stand for Apple iPad 2 / iPad 3 / The new iPad in red; I couldn't find the red one in the product link section. With out a case or with a poor case, the corners will get pretty scuffed up and ugly. Also, on mine, the black plastic color part is kind of peeling. It's not that bad, though. Mind you that i'm a student, so I might do more things than you do. I recommend you get the Speck Products CandyShell Wrap for iPad 2 - DarkLord Black (SPK-A0418). I just ordered it from Amazon $20 cheaper than from the Speck site.iOS 5: I am at iOS 5.0.1, and for some reason, my iPad won't let me upgrade to 5.1. There isn't a huge difference, so don't feel like you are missing out.  The iOS is great. Everything is smooth, and the Internet browsing is great with the tabs. You can even split the keyboard in two and type with your thumbs, which is,neat, but not useful until you really learn how to use it. iCloud is also great. Every app I download on my iPhone gets downloaded on my iPad, and vice versa. Really useful. Still no freaking flash, though. There is an app you can download called Photon flash web browser, which lets you run flash programs. Really great for watching FLASH videos, if you know what I mean. I HAD TO! I HAD TO! I'm sorry. That was the dumbest thing ever, but you get what I mean. I rate the OS an A-Battery: I love the battery life, and at school, if I don't use it a lot, I can use it for another day. It has by far the best battery life of any LCD screen device I have. 'nuff said, A+Speed: the iPad is super quick with its A5 processor, running apps like a charm and browsing the Internet sometimes faster than my laptop. Hell. It is  probably is faster than my laptop. If you want something fast, it's definitely something to consider. A+Weight: not too heavy, but not too light either. Feels perfect. It fits in my booksack, so it's good for me. AOne thing that makes me rate it 4 stars is the AirPrint or whatever Apple calls it. (my iPad recognized the word and spellchecked it, so I think I that's right) It's complete crap. There are only a select few printers that it can print to, and you have to jailbreak if you want otherwise. It's so dumb, and I print things a lot. I truly hate it. I am soon going to buy the network printing app on Cydia, so that will soon be gone, but still. Bad choice, Apple.All in all, I rate the iPad 2 an A. If you want to save some money, buy the iPad 2 instead of the new iPad, but if it's your starting model and you don't care about the price, go with the  Apple iPad MD328LL/A (16GB, Wi-Fi, White) NEWEST MODEL. The only reason to but this one is if you are price-conscious and the new iPad is too much for you. The iPad 2 is still great,but the display on the new one and the better proccessor make it a better buy.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Versatile and Powerful", "Author": "Jeffrey A.

The camera is a nice-to-have addition.  The iPhone 4 has a better camera and is easier to use when taking pictures - the iPad is a bit bulky to use as a camera.  Also, for me, cellular connectivity is a must since I travel frequently and can't always rely on a WiFi signal.  Cellular data plans are about $25/month, so if you don't need it, you can save a fair bit of money.  I might still recommend getting the device with the cellular antenna - you can enable it when you need it and cancel data plans when you don't.

I have a Windows phone paired with a Mac computer.  So, I generally buy products based on the product rather than the company. At first, I was completely against getting an iPad, since I figured that my Mac could do anything that my phone couldn't. I broke down my favorite aspects and least favorite aspects of the iPad 2 (not software, but hardware):Favorites:1) The weight distribution of the tablet: It doesn't seem to be too heavy, or too light (as in cheap).2) Materials: I was leaning more toward a Android tablet, but the materials that went into those felt so cheap to me. The iPad 2 has a great aluminum feel to the back, with a glossy front.  I miss the Gorilla Glass of my Samsung phones though, since I never needed a screen protector.3) Everything just works:  If you have ever had an Android phone, you understand what I mean. Occasionally, the Android OS just freezes, or crashes (at least on my previous phone).  When you press the home button, there is no lag.  This has more to do with the software of the iPad (iOS 5). True, it is more of a restricted OS than the Android OS, but its a sacrifice I was willing to make.4) The prestige that comes with an iPad:  This may sound shallow, but I didn't not want to have to defend my position of getting an Android tablet over an iPad.  This holds its value long into the future, verses lesser known Android tablets.5) Clean lines:  A minimalistic design.  Clean cut, very stylish.Least Favorite:1) True, the iPad is very balanced, but it does get heavy when reading after awhile.  If you are looking for an ereader and won't be going into the features of the iPad, then don't buy it.  Buy the Kindle Fire or another device.2) Every accessory seems to be (excluding a few of course) very expensive.  If you want a good deal, you have to be willing to hunt for awhile, buy used, or pony up the extra money to buy the protective case, or screen protector, etc.3) I still feel nervous carrying it around with me. Its a double edge sword... yes, I love the prestige that comes with the ipad, but so do the thieves.Overall, this review isn't going to make someone who doesn't want one, buy an iPad.  What I must say is: if you have never used an iPad, don't hate on iPad owners.  After using this for awhile, I can't understand my hesitation at first to buy one, or why I waited so long.Advice: rumors are swirling about the next iPad (claims to be iPad 3).

Size, weight and battery life is super. You can use it the whole day, and angry birds is seriously addictive. It remembers each network and its settings so that I do not have to manually change proxy settings everytime I move from office to another place.Cons:Everyone has said it but I'll say it again: No flash = No point! It is so annoying that you have to keep going from one applet to another to do things that you can normally do on a browser. Seriously, if you tube just decided to use flash and to remove their App I think Apple would go bankrupt.Editing stuff is impossible or as difficult as doing it on your phone, with the exception of a larger keyboard.

Yes there is a magnifier which allows you to scroll the cursor but how tedious it is!A lot of the other stuff has been mentioned in other reviews but these were teh maain points for me.Also - a note for people considering a laptop or this - buy a laptop. This is the 3rd thing you need.This is really ideal for someone who has a large heavy laptop which stays in one place and needs a lighter device to carry around for just brisk surfing, checking mail, watching some youtube and playing games (ie a bigger version of an iPhone).However, if I knew what I know now I would never have bought this thing.

Because by the time I realized it was more than a 'silly' toy everyone was talking about the 2nd generation.I am VERY glad I did and here's why:1. The 2nd generation is much faster than the original.2. The design, while very similar is more sleek and lighter.3. The cameras are a great addition.Video Skype works great on this tablet - the cameras make showing people things FAR simpler due to the front and back placement.Convenience - I take this to class and with the addition of a bluetooth keyboard I am able to easily take notes in class while carrying FAR less than my laptop in weight.- The battery life is excellent! This thing can go for two days without a recharge! And that's with fairly heavy usage (try that with a laptop!)- The app store is getting better all the time - there are plenty of applications that make using this extremely convenient without having to take the laptop around (it weighs around 1/5 that of my laptop)- even if you bring the charger - it's far less bulky than the laptop charger.This really is the future of mobile computing. The touchscreen is extremely responsive, the machine is very fast - wifi works extremely well.The majority of my iphone apps work on this tablet.The only issue I have is the reflective screen - I am not a fan of the reflective screen and have ordered a matte screen protector - not because I feel it needs protecting, but because I want to be able to read in various lighting conditions.If you waited the first time - wait no longer - very much worth it in my mind.", "Date": "March 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "The ipad 1,2,3, and 4", "Author": "Jo Apple \"Jo\"", "ReviewID": "RLHS8GHEA78HP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have the ipad 4 now and I have had all of the other I pads except the first generation. I am a gadget girl who luvs Apple products. Honestly speaking, there is such a small difference between the 2nd and 4th generation ipads its not worth the upgrade. If you wear glasses and/or have trouble with blurriness and stuff then by all means upgrade to the 3, but the 4th generation is not even a noticeable difference.  It does have a faster processor but not Samsung fast, so if given the choice go with the 2nd generation if its a lot cheaper than 3rd generation. If the 2nd and 3rd are close in price go for the 3rd generation.To sum it up1st generation- good for a kid2nd generation- good if you can get it for a lot less than the 3rd generation.3rd generation- good for people who can use every bit of clearness in reading/suffer from blurriness, cant find a good deal on a 3rd generation.4th generation- if you want normal speed service, its not super fast but it is average which is good.Now if you are trying to decide between the iPad and the samsung. You cant compare Apples and oranges. apples are apples and oranges are androids. the samsung is much much much faster and allows you to use flash, but in my opinion that is all.

It's a beautiful product, as with all other Apple products I have purcThe hased however.....the Wi-Fi capability is not so good. It works for a while and then stops working. I called Apple. They had me delete the password for my network and then put the password back in. It worked fine for a while...just as it did when I first installed it. But only for a while. I don't get it. I have a relatively new Belkin 2 wireless network on Cable and have been using it for several years. I have two laptop computers, two printers, and an iPod touch with Wi Fi. They all work just fine. I can work all day, every day on any of these devices from anywhere in my house or in my yard.But not with the iPAD 2.with the iPad 2 it works for a while and then stops working. Very frustrating.This is not only a review but a request for help if anyone knows what's going on.BELOW IS A FOLLOW-UP ON MY IPAD2:BTW IF YOU DON'T WANT TO READ ALL OF THIS, HERE IS A QUICK SUMMARY OF THE MOST IMPORTANT POINTS:1. It never worked properly on my home network or other networks I tried at Starbucks, shopping centers, etc.2. It was too big and heavy.3. To read a book on it was a problems because it was heavy and just touching a little part of the screen caused pages to flip by very fast which meant I had to search for where I was about every few minutes.4. Even though I bought a 2 years warranty, sent it in for repair and eventually got a new/used one from Apple it still never solved any of the problems.5. Apple never would do anything substantive for me...like give me my money back or give me an Apple credit. So in the end I had to sell it for what I could get - $400, which meant I lost $250+plus the accessories, apps, the Warranty etc. I had spent.I am NOT an Apple basher and I enjoy my iPods (3) we have in our family. However, I'll never buy Apple again because of their \"return\" \"credit\" etc. policy. They have really made me unhappy with this experience and I did everything I could to work with them.I got an iPad2 with 32Gig memory ($599) + a \"magic cover\" ($60) from Loretta for my birthday this year. The \"magic cover\" is magnetic. It covers and protects the screen of the iPad2 when you're not using it and turns the machine on and off by putting the cover on and off. I also bought an $80 2-year warranty service. So all in all, without tax and shipping, we spent about $720 for the thing. The short story is the iPad2 didn't work for me. It wouldn't stay connected to our network. Every time I wanted to use it I had to go through the network settup process all over again. Apple Customer Service was no help. After hours with them I sent it in for \"repair.\" I got it back and it worked exactly the same, which is to say, it didn't work exactly as it didn't work before I sent it in. I kept asking for my money back or a credit but they kept refusing. Finally I sent it to them and they sent me a \"new\" (i.e. new to ME) unit. That's right, they did NOT say they would give me a new iPad2. They said they would give me a \"refurbished\" unit. I thought this was crappy since I'd only owned the thing for a month and had spent most of that time on the phone with their service department. Anyway, I got a \"new\" unit and it worked the same...i.e. it didn't work. Again, they refused to give me my money or a credit. So I finally just sold it. I got $400 for it so we lost about $350 (with shipping and tax).Besides not hooking up to our network, it was also big and heavy and no fun to sit and read books or browse the web or do any of the things I wanted it for. Reading a book, for example was a hassle. You had to hold this big heavy thing by the very edge of the \"frame\" because if you touched the screen anywhere it would flip through pages FAST and I spent most of my time trying to find where I left off. A real pain.Apart from all of that, the iPad2 is beautiful, has a beautiful screen and presents a beautiful, rich, colorful picture of whatever you're viewing. But not that much better than my Dell laptop.By the way, I KNOW our network works. It's the most recent Belkin WAP2 system and it works flawlessly with both of our Dell laptops, our DELL wireless color printer and our Brother wireless Laser Printer. I also had an Apple iPod Touch which worked perfectly using our same Wireless network. So it HAD to be something in the iPad2 that just didn't work. Anyway, I don't think I'll buy anything more from Apple, mainly because that even when something doesn't work right out of the box they won't give your money back or even give you a credit.What I DID buy and am very happy with, is an Amazon Kindle Latest Generation Wi Fi for $140 + $60 for a leather cover with built in reading light which actually works.The networking on the Kindle works great...just like our Dell Laptops and our printers.For more money, you can get a Kindle with not only Wi Fi but also 3G, so it will work using your phone network as well as your home network. We didn't need that feature though.The Kindle is great for reading books, magazines, newspapers, etc. You can get thousands of free books, but current books, or subscriptions to periodicals will cost you. If I was still traveling I'd get the 3G and subscribe to the NY Times but I can't read all of the news I want to (which isn't much) on my computer.What I do like, is reading books on the Kindle. You can set up your machine with the font, font size, number of words per line, etc. etc. so that everything you read is the same in terms of those features.You can shop for books at Amazon from your computer or from your Kindle using the Wi Fi or 3G system.It's black and white, but that's OK with me.It's small and light weight and very easy to use.The leather cover with built in light is a really nice feature. The light works off of the Kindle battery, which lasts about a month and charges up in less than an hour.Reading in bed, the light shines only on the Kindle page so it doesn't bother anyone else in bed with you.I've got about 100 books on my Kindle right now. All of them I got free from either Amazon or Gutenberg. When you \"buy\" from Gutenberg or some other free source you just download the file (in Kindle format) and email it to a special email address you get which is then on Amazon.Anytime you turn on your Kindle it automatically downloads whatever you've bought from Amazon or sent to Amazon from where you bought it.It also does audio books and works the same way with those. However, you have to plug in earphones of course, to listen.It holds 3500 books, so I've got plenty of room left.Anyway, if you're interested in an \"eReader\" I can recommend the Kindle over the iPad2.If you're interested in something with which to browse the web, I say, stick to a laptop.I know Apple makes some beautiful products, but I think the iPad2 is a flop for what I wanted to use it for.I think it's great for playing games on or looking at photos or maybe even watching a movie (after you've downloaded it) but I wouldn't want to try to watch a movie using \"streaming\" because of the networking issue.", "Date": "April 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "A truly useful device that makes a PC much less necessary", "Author": "S. Jentsch", "ReviewID": "R374CVRZO4753Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After five months of using a 16GB iPad 2 WiFi (no 3G), I can honestly say that it is one of the most useful technology purchases I can think of. While its price may scare many people away, its usefulness can justify its price, especially when compared to other devices that perform similar tasks. Not a day has gone by in the last five months where the iPad 2 hasn't been used several times, usually by several family members.Apple would like everyone to think that the iPad is revolutionary. Skeptics and critics scoff at the idea, but I would agree that it is a revolutionary product much in the same way that the Netbook (ASUS eeePC, et al) was a revolutionary product.Both products created a new paradigm in how you look at accessing information, media, and other tasks, and once you use them, you find it difficult to go back to the traditional devices. Netbooks nearly killed laptops, but in turn are getting killed themselves by tablets. People loved the small size of netbooks, but the keyboards and displays were often too small. Compared to an iPad, a typical netbook is too clunky and too heavy. Those with the need for a keyboard need the larger keyboard that a laptop provides, and those that don't embraced tablets as quickly as they could.Using the iPad for any length of time will make you not want to use your desktop PC for browsing the web or reading E-Mail. It's much more natural to hold a tablet in your lap or place it on the table next to you while having breakfast than it is to go into the other room and use a PC to do the same. Laptops are more portable than desktop PC's, but in comparison, they are much bulkier and many laptops have horrible battery life that don't come close to the 10 hours that one can get from the iPad 2.That's not to say that desktop and laptop PC's don't have their place. They definitely do. If you're doing anything complex that requires a keyboard or a mouse, those other devices shine. However, if you're composing a normal E-Mail, browsing the web, reading news feeds, checking Facebook, or watching videos on Hulu or YouTube, the iPad does these things very well. Typing on the on-screen keyboard, especially in landscape mode, is very easy and I've gotten quite fast at doing so. The picture quality on the screen is very good; probably better than most laptop and desktop PC monitors are, and the touch interface is so natural that it doesn't require hardly any orientation to get comfortable using the interface.Browsing the web is a joy on the 10\" screen. Sure, not having Flash compatibility is a pain sometimes, but Flash is one of those technologies of the past that is dwindling in popularity with the advent of HTML5, and it's in the site owner's best interests to develop versions of their sites that don't rely on Flash to do things that should have been done in other ways long before iOS devices came along. It's an occasional annoyance, but I don't consider the lack of Flash a dealbreaker in my mind. Web sites that don't work on the iPad are losing the business of the many that have iOS-based devices, and there are plenty of other sites that provide the same service that don't lean on the Flash crutch.Reading E-Mail using the built-in E-Mail app is also very good. I prefer the sidebar list of E-Mails that appears in landscope mode over the popup menu listing in portrait mode, but that's a personal preference. GMail integration is smooth, and being able to access multiple accounts makes it easy to check several mailboxes, either in one megalist or as separate accounts. The calendar app integrates with Google Calendar and the contacts from GMail are available in the Contacts list on the iPad as well. The integration with Google's various apps is very good.One of the best features of the iPad is the ecosystem that is built around the device. Apple has done a great job of supplying a major part of that by creating an AppStore with thousands of apps for just about every purpose one could think of. The iTunes store provides music, movies, and books for sale, but I prefer supplying my own music and movies, and Amazon's Kindle app / Kindle books is much more flexible and a better way to buy books in my opinion. On top of the software, the popularity of the iPad means that there are multitudes of accessories that cover the iPad, plug into the iPad, or otherwise complement the iPad in some way. No other portable device manufacturer has the 3rd party support that Apple has and that advantage shouldn't be overlooked.Speaking of accessories, I did a lot of looking at cases, and I settled on the AYL\u00ae 100% Premium Genuine Slim Leather Case Folio with Magnetic Closure and 3-in-1 built-in Stand for Apple Ipad 2nd Generation Tablet (Black). It's a folio style cover that works very well in protecting the device while not adding too much bulk. I highly recommend getting some kind of case, and this one is nearly perfect.The iPad 2 costs a lot of money. That makes it out of reach of some people, so it's not a slam-dunk. However, if you compare it to the cost of a new laptop or desktop PC, it's not out of line. If you're reading E-Mail, looking at videos, and browsing the web, the iPad does these things very well. You'll still need another device that will store your digital camera photos, keep track of your finances, and do the complex tasks that a desktop/laptop can do, but you'll need that device much less once you've discovered the ease of using something like this for those everyday tasks that don't require a full-sized keyboard and full-blown Windows programs to accomplish.No other tablet device currently available on the market has come close to the capabilities and the ecosystem that the iPad enjoys. I had hopes that the ASUS Eee Pad Transformer TF101-A1 10.1-Inch Tablet Computer (Tablet Only) would take it on, but it seems hampered by software issues (trying to do too much and be too flexible can be troublesome), the Androad app market still trails the iOS app market considerably, and the number of accessories available pales in comparison.The best non-iOS device that I think has a chance of being a contender is the Kindle Fire, Full Color 7\" Multi-touch Display, Wi-Fi. It has a great price point, it has Amazon standing behind it with an ecosystem that includes an AppStore, music store, video store for TV and movies, and the excellent Kindle books system, which is almost an ecosystem all by itself. I'm very interested to see how the Kindle Fire accomplishes the tasks of a tablet device and I hope that it can be a contender in the marketplace.Anyone interested in a tablet device should be looking at the major products that are available and see how those products serve their needs. While the iPad 2 is a major investment, I don't regret making the purchase.

My wife got one and I was so jealous I insisted I needed one as well. The uses are almost limitless. Best of all it is great for creating documents (writing novels), surfing the web, listening to music, and playing Apple games. In fact I only have one complaint about the lack of compatability with the Adobe Flash Player. Because of this it keeps you from playing a great many games including those on Facebook and other sites. Additionally certain videos at some sites will only play with the Adobe Flash Player. I hope in the interest of customer needs this will change in the future. Otherwise I am very satisfied with the iPad 2. I even got a Rover App-Controlled Spy Tank with Night Vision to remotely control with the iPad so my wife and I can watch the house and cats remotely. That brings some peace of mind, not to mention the Rover is a blast to play with.You can purchase cases and accessories to attach your iPad to your cars headrest to allow others to watch movies while traveling. There are a plethora of accessories for the iPad 2 so you will have plenty to choose from for covers, cases, adaptors, keyboards, et cetera. There are numerous apps that you can download to make it great for work and/or play. The apps can be free or range up to about twenty dollars on average. Most those I got were free or around four to seven dollars. I use mine extinsively because I can carry it anywhere and I don't have to sit at a desk to work on projects or listen to music and play games. If you're a highly mobile person this is a must have tool/toy.I imagine most students want one to make their homework easier to work on at school or home. Because of the decent drive space and WiFi you can almost do anything that you could do on a full size workstation whether you use a PC or Mac. Since you can even buy cases with keyboards it can easily replace a laptop for a lot less money and portability. Small enough to carry in a daily planner or purse it wins hands down in portability. Since you can now back files up on the web and use webmail it alleviates the headaches of more complex and costly workstation choices. You will still require a workstation to interface with for printing, transferring some files, USB transfers, and certain other functions. But at least when you need portability you will have it.Addendum: Although I am slightly disappointed that the iPad 3 came out on the heals of my purchase, I can't complain really as mine was purchased more for functionality than graphics.  One reader asked me if the WiFi was an issue to set up.  I didn't have any trouble with it.  In fact it's far easier than setting it up on a PC.  Once you set it up it automatically goes out and looks for a connection and will ask you which server to connect.  The beauty of it is if you decide you don't want to pay a monthly fee is you can just disable it until you want to use that feature again.  Now that the price has dropped on them, unless you need high resolution for movies or graphics, I recommend you seriously consider the iPad 2.CA Luster", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Boy, Did I surprise her!", "Author": "Brian J.

I would tell people \"I have an iPhone so why get just a bigger version?\"  My wife wanted to get an e-reader so I decided to put my money where my mouth was and buy a couple of iPads for us.  Hers would likely be a casual use device but I was going to try to use mine for business moving to a paperless work style (attempt #1,324 over the course of 12 years of different devices).Initial review was good... liked the device feel, weight, etc.  Clearly it looked nice.  I was offended at the cost of covers and accessories but I had somewhat gotten over that shock with the iPhone so it wasn't a new shock :) I felt that a lot of the app makers did a good job with their iPhone/iPad combined apps but it does suck to have to buy a separate app for those that don't have the combined versions.  But, overall a nice design and fun product to use.But, there's a big but here, it's too fragile and no recourse from an accident.  Like many others before me I broke mine.  Total bone-head move on my part, not at all an Apple fault in my situation, but if you spend some time reviewing forums you'll see the advice I failed to read.  The device is incredibly fragile so even simple (aka not bone-headed) slips, drops, and bumps will leave you with a busted screen.  With no attractive means of recourse.  One would think that any product with a propensity for a major functional piece to break there would be a repair option.  Not the case with Apple.  Probably part of the business plan to be honest.  I tried to find out my options and costs (secretly hoping for a free replacement like others have touted) but two different stores told me 1) not repairable by anyone; 2) any signs or attempt at repair void warranty; and 3) only option is a \"courtesy\" replacement for $270 (16mb wifi version).  No option for repair internally at Apple, let alone an option more reasonable than spending another $300.  I checked and the local repair place quoted about $185 plus tax and the parts I found online looked to run about $150+.  For a glass screen!Apple has a unique luxury in that they have a large client base that feels Apple can do no wrong.  An Apple \"genius\" could swing by the house at Thanksgiving and slap the loyalists grandmother and Apple would still be held up on a pedestal - the turkey was dry after-all.  So they don't bat an eye if iTunes misbehaves (the user shouldn't have tried to sync contacts), or if they try to connect with Outlook (the user shouldn't consider another product not made by Apple), or consider a good product would have given repair considerations to a critical yet fragile component.  The Apple flock is a great thing to have for a business.So anyway, I would say the iPad is a great device.  It'd be better if the screen were more widget based like the android options, but it's snazzy, quick, and a joy to use.  But, leave it sitting alone on the desk and protect it with your life if you buy it.  Otherwise buy an android option for half the price and if you could bust it three times and still be less expensive than the Apple will arguably as good of performance.", "Date": "December 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "MY FIRST IPAD", "Author": "Diane Tulli", "ReviewID": "RWLYPJOIXXIN5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "THIS IS MY FIRST I PAD.

Through gritted teeth whilst my friends enjoyed the cute novelty of the first release, I sweated out the wait for the version with the itty bitty webcameras and it was well worth the wait.  What is the point if you can't skype or facetime?An iPad is simply handicapped without a webcam, well, Apple made up for it with a vengence by having TWO in version 2! One at the back one at the front to toggle between.  Making self-photography a breeze to compose and shoot with minimal error.  FaceTime, the apple version of skype now comes bundled to facilitate easy \"skype-ing\" between iPad owners (akin to free video calls on the back of a wifi network).  This is video networking made accessible to the masses.This also becomes your camera and video camera for web publishing - the resolution though not the highest is laudable. And the pixel warehouse for your digital camera to download to when one is travelling.Like the iPhone, the iPad further usurps the position of the iPod relegating it further into the abyss of obsolescence - by incorporating a digital iPod inside for portable music & video storage and playback. It is not hard to allow one's life to revolve around this little tablet which makes it both a great productivity & recreational tool. Akin the hp's iPaq in 2004 except much more versatile graphically and with a much improved touchscreen.The plethora of apps available at the Apple appStore is like a digital candy store (hundreds of thousands). So much to sample so much to buy.  Brilliant marketing to make it so cheaply available.  The volume drive works beautifully during this post GFC era where excesses are a little less rampant and frugality rules the day. 0.99 cents for a shot of adrenalin or seretonin secretion is not an unattractive proposition.Goodbye to clutter as subscriptions go digital.

As for connectivity, it is only WiFi, so it can have its limitations as far as access to online informations are concerned, but with the IPhones handy, it is kind of OK.What makes it different from the Iphones and the ITouch is primarily the display size, which on many occasions are far more feasible than the smaller units. There is just so many things that are much better on a bigger screen than it be on the smaller units, net browsing and entertainment, not to mention the Medical Programs that are available in the iTunes store. And that is an other plus for the unit, all being the same brand, they are all synchronized and maintained through a single account, which makes the control of context so much easier compared to having different brands units, organized with different environments and operating systems.As for the connectivity issue, it being only WiFi, I have a HUB that allows me to connect 5 wifi units on one 3G network, and thou I must admit I have not used it that often yet, but it has it's benefits.12/26/2011: just had to add this small remark to my review. I have been in Dubai for the last 3 days, and with my this iPad, I have been able to keep in constant contact with my Hon, via SMS text and voice/video (via FaceTime) ... That being despite it is only a WiFi unit. I have to say, that is rather marvellous ....For the unit, for maintain, a Screen protector is highly recommended. Given the fact that it is a touch screen, even if the protector gets scratched up, you can just replace that instead of having to replace the screen itself. Also, a hard case is recommended, in my case, MA Hon got me a book case, which fold and serves as a stand as well. As for a stylus, a Soft Rubber unit is the best, I have a belkin, but I am sure you be able to find some less expensive ones that serves the purpose just as well.I have had the unit for 10 days now, and have yet to explore MANY options available, but given the fact that I have been using the Apple's units for years now, it is all coming easy. But I can highly recommend it. Surely the Apple products are a bit pricy compared to some of the competing units, but for my needs, the compatibility and access that it offers with the other units that I possess, it is worth the couple of extra bucks. Not to mention the fact that the Apple units are some of the most beautiful and state of the art units that are available on the market, and the drawback of shortage of available softwares....

I however, do not like watching movies on my IPad, because any movie that comes from Itunes is only in wide screen format which makes the actual movie frame very small.

This was something manufacturers of other tablets did not do when they rushed their way to the market Apple was claiming all to itself. The result was a number of products, most of which had bugs or other serious performance problems.Anyway, the iPad 2 bulked up a bit from its predecessor. A dual core processor and a little more RAM helped keep this device up with the Johnsons, spec-wise. Usability-wise, it's still as friendly to the user as can be. The interface isn't complicated and anyone familiar with how an iPhone works will have no problem getting into this device right away.Cameras on front and back were added. It's a shame they couldn't get a HD camera sensor in the device because that would make Facetime all the better. As it is, the video quality isn't that great but it does what it says it does and the video chat function works pretty nice. The back camera? Never used it and don't plan to.Then there is the App Store itself. Instead of paying $69.99 every time you need to feed your kid's hunger for a new game, you can drop 99 cents for most applications, whether they are games or educational apps or any of the vast amount of programs created that fit anyone's budget. As tablets become more and more popular, more and more content is finding its way onto the device. ABC has a player where you can watch their new shows in their entirety. HBO has one, too. Doctors are using these devices as they make patient records easily available. Teachers use these to track grades for their classes and educational apps help them figure out what subject matter their students may be struggling with. And these are just two niche examples of what the device can do. As an everyday consumer, you can really shape this device around your life and even find applications that make your professional life easier.For a portable, in your bed experience, this works wonders. The backlight trims when it detects low lighting so your eyes won't strain. The 10 inch screen is more than enough for watching Netflix or other content you can stream (I use AirVideo since I have a lot of media on my home machine and it streams it all -- .AVI, .MKV, .MP4 -- perfectly).If you take this wifi model out of the house and find yourself in places where you don't have wifi access, you can still use whatever apps you have that don't require an Internet connection, or you can play videos that you store on the device. Since this is Apple we're talking about, you can find apps that will play any kind of media so you aren't stuck with just the .MP4 codec that Apple would prefer you use.There aren't many limitations to the device...Adobe Flash support is usually cited among the things people don't like about the device. Good news on that front: Adobe is abandoning Flash for mobile devices (in part because they can't fix the non-stop security holes Flash has) so eventually that won't be a concern. Steve Jobs said Adobe Flash was garbage and didn't get support for it with the iPad. Other manufacturers chose to include Flash but it didn't take long before they admitted it killed the battery life on their devices, while the iPad2 can go all day without needing a charge. Watch movies all day. Play games all day. You don't need this hooked up to a power outlet all the time like you would a laptop and this is much easier to carry around, so the number of situations you can use this device (waiting rooms, long car trips, air travel) goes way up.There are many things to like about this device and there are some drawbacks (no USB support besides tethering to your computer, no HDMI, no Adobe Flash and no expanded memory card slots. But they are few and nearly insignificant when you realize there are alternatives to the roadblocks you think you may face, including cloud storage.This tablet is the cream of the crop. There is some good competition out there but the ease-of-use, availability of 70,000 plus apps in the Apple app store, plus how dependable the device is keeps Apple on the throne of best tablet manufacturer.", "Date": "November 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Simplified Everything!", "Author": "LF2011", "ReviewID": "R52PF2HED3Y8V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not a tech guy. In fact, I generally loathe having to deal with computers and technology. Unfortunatly, since I own my own business I spend a large part of my day sending e-mails, processing orders, and doing book keeping, so much of my day is spent interacting with technology. I also spend a good portion of my day on the road, and until recently I had to lug my laptop around. Whenever I found down time, wherever I was, I'd have to bring it out, wait for it to boot up, log on to the internet, get my work done, then wait for it to shut down. It got the job done, but it was heavy and awkward to carry around, and uncomfortable to use in the car.I'd been considering switching to a tablet for a long time, and when I finally decided to go ahead and make the switch I researched every tab on the market. I spent a lot of time testing tabs at the electronics stores. Some just weren't very intuitive, and getting them to perform required more effort than I was willing to invest. Some were choppy. Some seemed to crash every 5 minutes.The one that always operated beautifully was the Ipad 2. Unfortunately, my business requires that I watch videos my clients send me, and the lack of flash support worried me. Ultimately I decided I could use the Ipad on the road and watch whatever videos I couldn't get to play when I got home to my computer.Set up was very easy - and I'm not the most computer literate guy. Downloaded Itunes, plugged the Ipad in, and it was up and running. Within an hour the lack of flash support became annoying... Then I did a bit of research and found an App for $4.99 that allowed me to view flash on my Ipad flawlessly! The Ipads one limitation was solved for less than $5.00! Now I have Apps that simplify every element of my business. Maps, record keeping, creating documents...The Ipad is wonderful to travel with. Day to day, on the road locally, it is light and slim, easy to take with my wherever I go. When I need to access records or check my e-mail I no longer have to wait for my laptop to boot up, with the touch of a button my Ipad is up and running, and on the internet moments later.The battery life is stunning... It keeps me entertained and/or productive on long flights, and in hotel rooms in unfamiliar cities.I very rarely use my laptop since I got my Ipad. My Ipad does everything my laptop did for me, only it usually does it faster and easier. In fact, the main thing I wish I could change about the Ipad is the fact that it needs a computer to sync with (though it only needs to do this very rarely)... I wish it were a completely independant device so I could just set my laptop aside completely and let it gather dust.The Ipad isn't 100% perfect. The camera isn't impressive at all. Watching flash requires downloading and using a seperate web browser app (I generally use Safari, overall its a better browser than the flash enabled one. When I run into a flash issue, I copy the address, open the Photon app and paste the address there) It's slightly annoying to have to take the extra steps, but it's not a huge issue.Overall, I couldn't be happier with it!", "Date": "September 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "OK gift", "Author": "A Scott", "ReviewID": "R3LDFTAAZWXXHU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got this as a gift.

My biggest reason for wanting an iPad 2 was I found the screen of the touch too small to surf the web or read a book, I wanted GPS (have to get the 3G model for that), camera (we use FaceTime a lot keeping in touch with family) and 3G for internet access for when we travel and are at places with no wifi.  I spend many hours at various sporting practices each week and for the past two years, the touch has kept me entertained (I actually looked forward to practice since it gave me at least two hours to sit and catch up on everything).The iPad has taken it to a whole new level.  I have more reading material than I can read (books, magazines, email, etc.).  I love Netflix and HBO GO and I use it to stargaze at night (it can control my telescope through an app).  The entire family likes it so much that It's made the touches obsolete.  My husband who never liked the touch keeps taking my iPad.  The best part for me is that I am no longer chained to the computer.  I can read the news and check my calendar at the kitchen table or the over stuffed chair while having me coffee.  The only thing I've been using the laptop for is syncing.My complaints are that I can no longer use my computer to charge the iPad (the car charger is also obsolete for the iPad.  I had to but a new one).  I also purchased two extra long USB cables and an extra charging brick as the cords that come with it are too short to charge and sit comfortably on the couch.  I also found that I can no longer use my Altec Lansing speaker dock to play music so that's something else I'll want to replace eventually.I purchased 1GB of data from Verizon for $20 for the month to see how far it would go.  I've been pleasantly surprised.  I may run out of time to use it before I run out of data.

I currently have my iPad sitting on the floor in my office so it can charge. Not a very useful location!The USB outlet connector is also frustratingly designed. It has so much mass above and below the prongs that, when plugged into a power strip, it covers outlets on both sides of the one it's plugged into.

Naturally, I was impressed at how quick and easy it was to use.  A lot of thought has gone into the product and it shows.  Instant on (I have the magnetic cover) is a bonus and the screen - large and crystal clear - is not so much a selling point but rather a \"how to\" example for other tablet manufacturers to follow.The Apple store in the meatpacking district of New York City has a qualified, and very friendly, staff who set the unit up for me while they answered my various questions. Considering that they had been doing this since 5 PM and it was now after 10, that is a lot of dedication for one staff!  The most amazing thing is: they were all quite proud of the iPad 2. It says a lot when the company employees are that loyal.And the iPad 2 deserves such praise.  The product is, in short, wonderful.  Light weight yet with a solid feel to it, I plan on taking mine to Europe shortly.  After you turn it on, the balance of the iPad 2 is self-explanatory.  From the opening screen of icons, the touch screen makes it almost too-easy to take the product that seriously. But it is a useful tool what with a Calendar, notebook, iPod, photo studio, etc. Naturally the much hearalded APP STORE is there and works fine and at a lightning speed.  Although I wonder about the \"10 hour battery life\" claim - it does manage to work long enough to please the most diligent of users.Where the iPad falls short is in the area of productivity.  Much discussed, and a sore point, is the lack of a USB port. In todays day and age, that is almost an unforgivable sin. I did get the hook up so I could download my pictures (it works too - and, again, it does it so fast and so effortlessly that it is a minor miracle). There is something almost childish in the decision not to include at least one USB port especially after the loud fracas that happened after the release of the first iPad.  FLASH is another sore point and, frankly, one that I don't understand. There is some conflict going on with the world of APPLE and flash so we don't have it. This makes it very difficult to surf the web. Safari is quick but without flash, it misses one of its major components. Again, and this is just my feeling, this is something that could have been corrected quite easily - starting a year ago with the original.  Now, the iPad 2 (and the original version, I'm sure) can still do quite an amazing amount of work without these two features but as they are considered standard, it is a puzzle as to why the iPad 2 did not have both of them installed.  Also, the lack of a port decreases the iPad's place in the workforce. How can you install, let's say, OFFICE MAC?  The system can print (via Bluetooth) so it could be used as an Office-on-the-run (held landscape, the keyboard is quite easy to do some very fast typing upon - one could produce an awful lot of work on it but . . . without a CD drive to install programs, it makes it difficult).Other than that, the unit is nothing short of brilliant.

Pay us and pay us and pay us. Many of the \"free\" ipad apps are very buggy. You are left to read user's reviews and \"try\" out the app which can make you waste 2 hrs of your time because it is not a properly written app and \"hangs\" or crashes. Then you have to \"jump through hoops to get it off Itunes or it will remain on your ipad2. If you have to uninstall it, you waste more time.As I said 50% of it is \"slick\" and 50% of it needed three years to get the biggest \"bugs\" out of it.Safari browser is a difficult and cumbersom adjustment for Windows users. The E-Mail program requires you to relearn EVERYTHING Apple's way. Sound will not automatically play in many or most videos because they are tied to quick time. So now you are forced to buy other apps which may or may not play the video you just stumbled across.APPLE ITUNES IS AN ABSOLUTE JOKE. IT IS WRITTEN FOR YOU TO BUY STUFF FROM THEM PERIOD ! The first page that pops up is begging you to buy their songs or videos.Simply tranferring existing mp3's to the ipad 2 requires you to jump through hoops and waste an unbelievable amount of time.Documents to Go works fairly well unless your desktop crashes and you have to reload your desktop. Then, you have no way of simply \"syncing\" the existing files on the ipad2 to a new desktop. An absolute pain in the xxs and waste of time!There is NO seemless way to transfer existing password programs to take over in Safari. You have to buy the apple offerred program and I DID NOT find it easy to use.Video HAH ! Video plays beautifully BUT ONLY ON THE IPAD. Try and transfer the video elsewhere and you face aggravation. I downloaded the latest quick time to my computer and the download video file (through the cable) WOULD NOT PLAY.As I said aggravation. Would I buy one again or recommend the ipad2 ?

If you're still debating between the iPad 1 and the iPad 2 check out my review of the first generation iPad right here on Amazon to see a discussion of its strengths and weaknesses with a number of people commenting (both positively and negatively) over the past 11 months.Let me begin by saying this upfront, I don't work for Apple, I don't own Apple Stock, and whether you buy an iPad, Xoom, a laptop or a pad of paper and pencil I don't get anything for writing this. I'm not an Apple \"fanboy\" although I can give credit where credit is due and lately Apple has deserved a lot of credit for some of their products.Physical CharacteristicsThe iPad 2 is absurdly thin. More importantly than it's thinness is its tapered edge which feels more natural in your hand. One of the biggest complaints about the original iPad was it really wasn't tremendously comfortable to hold for long periods at a time. For a tablet device designed to be held, that's a pretty big deal. Apple really has done an amazing job of cramming everything into an even smaller space than before and the difference is really noticeable when you're holding the device. In addition to the tapered edge, Apple managed to reduce the overall weight of the iPad 2. That might not seem like a huge deal to most, especially when you consider the weight difference isn't tremendous when you're already under 2 pounds, but I spend a good part of my day holding the iPad in my hands and the weight difference is surprising by the end of the day. The first generation isn't heavy by any means, but the iPad 2 outshines it.New and \"Improved\"Apple doubled the RAM in the iPad 2 from 256MB to 512MB. What does that mean? For most casual users, probably not a whole lot. There is a performance bump that everyone will see the effects of in things like loading times for webpages that are open in the background, but 256MB was sufficient for most daily use and games. If you're planning to use your device for some of the more graphically intense games the iPad 2 does offer a better method of graphics processing that'll help deliver faster images with fewer jerky movements. If you're just playing Angry birds and reading e-mail you're not going to know the difference.The screen is the same for all real purposes. It is technically a \"new\" part in that it isn't identical to the old, it's a bit thinner and more efficient, but it's the same resolution. The Glass is thinner though, and this amounts to a fair bit of the weight loss from one generation to the next. In playing with the device it seems surprising but despite feeling lighter it actually feels more sturdy in your hands. I still wouldn't suggest dropping it, but if it were to fall the iPad 2 certainly feels like it might stand a better chance to survive. Try not to drop it though.The addition of 2 cameras was expected. Some were a bit surprised to see the first generation released without the cameras. Whether it was for a price point consideration, or a means to get people to upgrade, Apple held off until iPad 2. The cameras do a reasonable job, but they're not going to replace a dedicated digital camera, or really even the camera on your phone for most still images. The cameras do a substantially better job with video, and FaceTime is probably one of the best reasons to get the iPad 2 over the original iPad. For those who might not be familiar, FaceTime is Apple's face to face conferencing system, kind of like Skype, or if you'd rather, kind of like the Jetson's TV/Phone. With the push of a button you can be having a face to face chat with a loved one just about anywhere in the world (provided they're on a wireless network at the time). FaceTime doesn't work over 3G natively (it can be used over a wifi connection created by a 3G device however) so you're not going to be able to use it in your car anytime soon. This is probably a good thing though. It is incredibly easy to use and if you know other people with an iPad 2, iPhone 4, or Mac it's a lot of fun.Smart Covers aren't really \"smart\" but they're really very useful. Not only do they provide a stylistic enhancement of the device, but they serve a practical and functional purpose of doubling as a screen protector and stand in 2 configurations. You can find them in a variety of colors and from third market suppliers, and it's a safe bet that more will be out soon to capitalize on the magnetic sensors in the iPad 2. It's unfortunate that this same feature can't somehow be retrofitted to the iPad 1, I wouldn't have thought a case would be a compelling reason to consider a product over it's competitor, but these covers are really so useful it's hard to understand why they've not been there since the beginning.Multitasking SupportOne of the biggest knocks against the iPad when first released was the lack of native multi-tasking support. Jailbreakers added the feature quickly and Apple soon realized it would be a requirement for any future device's success and released an OS update that included the feature. The iPad 2 capitalizes on that progress and takes it a step further with the increased RAM enabling more open applications to be suspended at once, and the time to open or close an application has improved as well. That said, even the first generation managed to open and close apps faster than most people would be used to on their computers, so while this is an improvement it's more akin to showing off.AppsOne thing that Apple has clearly the advantage in for the moment is app availability. The App store has close to 70,000 iPad specific Apps, all of which will work on the iPad 2. The new cameras will undoubtedly see this list expand rapidly, as will the inclusion of a gyroscope for gaming and motion based uses. There are also a substantial number of professional applications ranging from document creation to photo editing and vector drawing. Chances are if you can dream it, there's an App for that (and if not you might want to get started on one to fill in the gap). The Android market is making a strong showing, and ultimately it'll likely be a strong competitor, for now it still has a ways to go, but any potential buyer should consider the strength of the application market before buying a tablet.Pros:Weight. Seriously. The minimal weight of this thing is by far the most impressive feature about it in my opinion. It seems to defy physics and logic that so much could be in such a small space working that hard for that long.Battery Life. From full to dead my iPad 2 went just over 11 hours with the movie Robin Hood showing twice during that time, the screen at half brightness, wifi turned on, an Angry Birds marathon and a good portion of a book in ibook. That's better than a work day and that's constantly on.Books. This is definitely a Pro, but reading itself could go either way. The great benefit to the iPad is having access to Google Books, ibook, Nook, and Kindle. This allows for some comparison shopping and price competition (although for the most part they're all usually about the same). Reading in the evenings in bed is great as the back light means you don't have to worry about keeping others awake, but the glass screen causes some glare trouble when trying to read outside or near a sunny window. If you're an avid outdoor reader the Kindle might still be your best bet.Cons:Still no dedicated USB support. While there is a camera add-on that allows for certain USB devices to be used there is no option for mass storage. Some of the Android Tablets allow for this and if you find yourself wanting to use your tablet as a standalone storage device this might be something to consider. The device can read from certain flash drives though, but is largely limited to photo and video files. Jailbreaks offer solutions to this, but those come with their own issues as well.Still no dedicated SD card slot. This is troublesome on two fronts. First, if you want to import pictures from your camera you have to have an adapter which is just one more thing to carry around. Second, the lack of expansion means you're limited to what you purchase in terms of storage. I purchased a 32GB iPad last time and never filled it up completely, so for me capacity wasn't an issue. If you want to be able to have your entire movie collection with you though... you may want to consider whether the iPad 2 can meet your space requirements.HDMI output. Really this is a Pro and a Con. The iPad does allow for HD output over HDMI but again it requires an adapter. All of these adapters are additional purchases for features that some tablets offer built in. This can be a pain, but then again if you're not likely to ever use HDMI Output then you're not paying for something you won't use.No Flash Support. This is becoming less and less of an issue as the internet and web developers are moving away from Flash for many websites, but there are a lot still out there relying on Adobe's Flash to run properly (including a lot of web based games). Before you pick a tablet consider what kind of websites you frequent and try and determine if they are Flash driven or not. If they are you may really want to consider something from the Android offerings as it is expected that they'll have at least some Flash support.If you're in the market for a tablet device the iPad 2 should definitely be on your short list. If you're uncertain it is always best to go and play with these things hands on first if you can. Best Buy is a good place for that, so are Verizon Stores since they have the Xoom and 3G iPad. Don't get pulled into the hype and mania that comes with an Apple release. They're exciting and new, and they're impressive enough to warrant some excitement, but it will die down and there will be other products that prove a strong competitor to the iPad 2. If you're looking for right now though, this is probably your best bet. I gave the device 4 stars, as I did the iPad 1. I did this in contemplation of the features offered by competitors that are absent from the iPad, most notably the requirement for adapters for USB/SD/HDMI. While these features are there, they aren't as convenient as in other tablets. With that in mind I firmly believe that the iPad more than makes up for this in usability, reliability, and design and in those areas far exceeds its current competitors.", "Date": "March 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nothing ground breaking here.", "Author": "Bubba", "ReviewID": "R3C23RDV8I3RHH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Really people? For the money this thing is stripped down. They just now add a forward and back facing camera and everyone is like ooh cool. This feature has been on cell phones forever. It should of been added on the original ipad. Think about it. A cell phone has more features than an ipad. Smartphones now have high resolution front and rear facing cameras with flash, able to use the flash as a flashlight, sd card slots, cable hook up to t.v's, wifi, usb, physical keypads, can download music without proprietary software, and so on. All in one little package. Now don't tell me they don't have room on an ipad to add any features.Yes they made this a little lighter and a little faster. But for the price you can buy a powerful laptop or netbook that will leave the ipad 2 in the dust. And you won't have to pay for proprietary cables or accessories for dowloading your pictures, files, music etc. like the camera kit, which doesn't work for all cameras or memory cards to transfer pictures. And don't forget you have to pay for all the Mac apps. And oh you want a physical keyboard? More money. Wait you better buy a protective case to protect your new investment that probably is adding up to almost a grand now. That's where Apple gets you. You have to buy their proprietary products and services. And they will add features and memory upgrades a little at a time to newer models so you will want the latest features. Just like their ipods and itouches.If you are thinking about replacing a computer with this, then read on. If not, then read elswhere.All that said...if you want to do work on it, consider getting a loaded netbook which is a better value and more powerful, more memory and you don't have to go through the hassle of downloading or uploading to another computer like you would have with an ipad. With a netbook you can just load data onto an sd card or thumb drive if you want to instantly. What if you don't have a computer around with an ipad and you want to transfer some files or pictures onto it or want to just download some files and take it with you on a thumb drive. Oh wait did you remember to bring the cables or adapter with you on top of that? Do you want adapters protuding from your expensive ipad waiting to be bumped and snapped off? Also do you use Windows or Mac? Is your printer cabable of over the air printing? If not then you have to either get a capable printer or transfer the data onto a computer that is hooked up to your printer. If it were not for the touchscreen, would anyone buy an ipad? HECK NO! It would be considered a featurless outdated piece of equipment comparable to something about 10 plus years ago. See where i'm going here. But on the same note, a netbook is not as portable. So weigh out your wants and needs. I ended up getting a netbook after research and playing with them and no regrets because I can do anything on it and it is a spare because the kids take up the other computer. I couldn't of done much with the ipad except surf the web. Example, my wifes work computer crashed and she was working from home. Well luckily she had the netbook because she hooked up the netbook to her lcd monitor and logged into a computer at her work place remotely and kept on working. And I also had the netbook hooked up another time to my flatscreen, an external hard drive, mouse, and an sd card in the slot so I could edit pictures, back them up and print them. I also had an extra usb port to spare where I could of had a phone plugged in to charge at the same time my netbook was charging also. Couldn't of done all this with an ipad let alone charge it at the same time if you had something plugged into it's single proprietary port. Get at least an 11.6 inch netbook if you decide on one and still want functionality and portability. Everything fits on the screen better and not crammmed in. Keep in mind though that some netbooks come with just Windows starter and not a full working edition. If you don't get the full working edition, then the netbook would not be of much use. But oh when I just want to lounge around and surf the web, I wish I had a tablet. But I use my phone for that, lame but it works. Oh yeah, I can tether my phone to the netbook also.Personally I think this is mainly usefull for surfing the web or used as an electronic organizer for someone on the move who has to keep track of a lot of information or carries a clipboard i.e. invoices, work orders, short note taking, etc. or needs visual images out in the field. But to use in place of a real computer, no. You can buy apps. for the ipad to do some work on, but they are not as powerful. So think about what you want or need it for. Ask yourself something like this. Do you need something portable for school where you can do term papers and homework on, or for organizing and socializing? This is not a replacement for a computer if that's what you want. It is a media device with limitations features wise. Also with a netbook you can have a spare battery and swap it out and continue on. With an ipad you have to plug it in and wait for it to charge and it defeats the purpose of mobility doesn't it? Yes you ipad defenders, I know the battery charge lasts pretty long, but there are variables affecting it like what you are running and what if you forgot to plug it in overnight and you don't have time to charge it.I'm not saying a tablet doesn't have it's place because it does. And yes I know that an ipad and a netbook are two different things. But it may not serve your needs so be aware. I can see where an ipad or any other tablet would be more practical or even a no brainer because a clamshell design of a netbook might be just to clunky. I'm just pointing out the lack of features on the ipads. If they only would add a memory card slot or standard usb to make it simple to transfer data or so I can hook up other peripherals. I don't want to pull out cables or turn on my computer and sync it everytime I want to transfer data. But don't hold your breath. They want you to buy another one with more memory if you need more. A memory slot or usb would give you the option of adding more memory of your own. And it won't take you long to fill up the little memory the ipad offers if you like to load media onto it.Size and price should be taken into consideration if you want to use it for entertainment away from home a lot. There are several tablets offered from competitors now and some are less expensive, more features, smaller and lighter and don't use a lot of proprietary cables or software applications or hardware, they have sd slots and or usb also. Something you might want to think about if you like to dowload or upload stuff on the fly and travel light. But it comes down to you to research ask questions and try to get some hands on to \"see what works best for you\". Just don't expect that all the tablets perform the same or offer the same apps. Your not going to get ipad performance or huge selection of apps. to choose from compared to a tablet that costs way less. If you just want it to take on vacation while relaxing next to the pool or to keep kids entertained then a less expensive tablet might fit your needs so you can still enjoy yourself and not have to worry as much about it getting stolen, lost, or broken. As for the ipad, you might be to concerned with it to enjoy yourself or it is just too big and a 7 inch tablet is more convienient. But if you want your cake and eat it too. Take a look at the Asus Transformer and Asus Slider. The transformer has a detatchable keyboard with a mouse pad and battery that extends your battery life, two sd slots, USB ports, and you can adjust the angle of the screen and close it like a netbook. The slider has a keyboard build into the tablet and screen flips up. No mousepad though. But there is a USB port that you can hook up a mouse to if you want. Also with the Asus tablets you can multitask and listen to something in the background while doing something else. With the ipad you can't. The Asus tablets support flash and you are able to watch clips on web pages, whereas the ipad you don't get to watch the clips because most clips are flash. The Asus tablets will fit movies on to the screen better and not have the black bars on the top like on the ipad. People are even getting rid of their ipads to get the Asus. There are also a few tablets out there that run Microsoft Windows. So that was just an example of other opions you have out there. Another thing to think about is that there are a lot of phones running on Android as for tablets also. So there is going to be a lot more compatibility between devices because most of them will run on Android. With Apple your limited with their products and don't have other outside options. The tide will turn with more offerings for Android because it will become main stream because most devices and manufacturers now are adapting the Android platform,while the \"I\" line of products are only exclusive to Apple. Will be like the Beta max vs VHS. Beta had better quality but most manufacturers adapted the VHS format instead of Beta. Well Beta died because everyone was making VHS products.Don't slam me if your an ipad lover. It's just things to think about. Don't know why people get so defensive about negative reviews about this thing. They must be the ones replacing their old Apple stuff with the newer models that have the newest inovation (cough, cough). What's new for next year? A flash for the camera? Or wait, maybe a phone feature. That way you can get rid of your cell phone and only carry the ipad around and not have to carry both. There are a lot of fan boys out there defending the ipad with not much to back it up and they take it personal. I think they are in denial and trying to justify their purchase. Well people you are the ones Apple preys on and you fall for it.Update: I finally broke down and got an Acer 7 inch A100 tablet for my daughter for Christmas. And after using it for a while, I will still stand by what said about the limitations and uses of a tablet. And the Acer A100 is only 7 inches perfect size for holding for long periods of time or for traveling instead of a bulky 10 inch. it can keep up with the ipad2 and has ports for micro sd, micro usb, micro HDMI, and hey even a flash for one of the two cameras. Hear that? A simple flash for the camera. Oooh...Oh wait, the ipad3 might get that, can't wait, it will make it the best ipad ever. Whatever...", "Date": "April 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "The Slimmer iPad From Apple; Look Ma Face Time", "Author": "Vincent E. Martin \"Darkbard\"", "ReviewID": "RWI1G903IDI3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Apple iPad.  Those of us who own one have recently been called less than flattering names for daring to use it and enjoying the experience!  But the devices' popularity is growing; indeed I am seeing them everywhere.  Just yesterday I sat next to a woman at my local Ford dealership who was reading a book on her iPad even as I held a text message conversion with a good friend while reading the news from CNN and NPR.For me the device fulfills several different functions I have been meaning to purchase in separate devices, like an e-book reader, portable music player for my master bedroom, and electronic photo frame.  Why buy all three of those devices when the Apple iPad does all three functions in one neat silver (albeit expensive) package?  And since buy my iPad in the Fall of last year, the uses for the device have grown tenfold, until now, it is almost indispensable.Now Apple has released the iPad 2 and those of us who use the original are throwing them over for the next big, or should I say smaller thing.  Since this new one was for the business I work for I decided to do a one for one replacement of the one I already used for testing purposes; in other words I ordered an \"iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G\" version.The \"iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi /3G\" FactsOn the surface the iPad 2 is not demonstratively different from the iPad Original.  Featuring a Dual-core (Apple designed) 1 GHz A5 processor, the 1.33 pound (1.34 pounds for the 3G) iPad 2 is notably thinner than the iPad Original, though the screen size stays the same.  The other big changes: two camera, one rear facing, the other front facing now ship standard with all models; and the graphics are reportedly 9 times as fast.No matter what hardware version (Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi/3G, 16GB, 32GB, or 64GB) you chose the Ultra-Portable, iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/ 3G is a simple device with very few moving parts.  The power button sits on the top of the device on the right, while a standard 3.5mm headphone jack is situated on the far left.  Along the right edge of the 0.5\" thick iPad you'll find the screen lock/mute and volume control switches, while the bottom of the 9.56\" long device is reserved for speakers and the USB/power port.  The USB port is proprietary so, no, like the iPad Original you cannot plug a USB memory stick into it, but with the provided cord you can plug it into your computer and into an outlet to recharge the device.The \"iPad 2\" (also available in black and white body styles) can be had with 16GB, 32GB, or 64GB of memory, and all iterations are fitted with a 1GHz Apple A5 custom-designed, high performance, low-power processor.  Internet connectivity is through either Wi-Fi (802.11a/b/g/n), and or 3G: UMTS/HSDPA (850, 1900, 2100 MHz) and GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz).  Bluetooth 2.1 EDR is also provided with either configuration.  A 4G model of the iPad2 has not been announced.The 9.7-inch fingerprint resistant LED-backlit glossy widescreen multi-touch color display offers 1024x768 resolution and can display multiple languages and characters simultaneously.  The IPad 2 is fitted with an ambient light sensor and the device supports 576p and 480p with Apple Component AV Cable; 576i and 480i with Apple Composite AV Cable and 1024x 768 with Dock Connector to VGA adapter.The back camera can be used for HD (720p) video recording of up to 30 frames per second with audio, as well as still camera with 5x zoom.  The front camera can also be used for (VGA) video recording of up to 30 frames per second with audio, as well as still camera pictures.New Apps that ship with the iPad 2 include FaceTime a real-time video chat application that allows you to calls someone else's iPad 2, iPhone 4, new iPod touch, or Mac over Wi-Fi and establish a video chat session.  The App will not work via 3G.  The other new App is Photo Booth an application that allows you to take pictures of yourself with various effects.Audio playback response frequency is 20Hz - 20,000Hz and the iPad 2 supports the following audio formats:o  HE-AAC (V1)o  AAC (16 to 320 Kbps)o  Protected AAC (from iTunes Store)o  MP3 (16 to 320 Kbps)o  MP3 VBRo  Audible (formats 2, 3, and 4)o  Apple Losslesso  AIFFo  WAVThe iPad can view the following document types:o  Images (.jpg, .tiff, .gif);o  Documents (.doc and .docx (Microsoft Word), .txt, .pdf, .rtf);o  Web pages (.htm and .html);o  Keynote (.key);o  Numbers (.numbers);o  Pages (.pages);o  PowerPoint (.ppt and .pptx)o  Outlook Contacts (.vcf);o  Excel (.xls and .xlsx)Re-syncing with iTunesThe iPad 2 will sync up whatever Apps, music, Podcasts, movies, etc., connected/ associated with your iTunes account and currently on your iTunes desktop.  I was able to sync the iPad 2 to iTunes and like magic everything that was on my iPad 1 showed up on my iPad 2, sans the folders I had set up to group Apps in.Transferring My AT&T; 3G AccountAll of the iPad 64GB Wi-Fi/3G devices I have purchased thus far use AT&T; for their 3G service.  There are two plans at the time of this review: $14.99 for 250MB a month data package and $25.00 for 2GB date package.A funny thing happened along the way to transferring my current 3G plan to my new iPad 2: AT&T; killed (deactivated) the removable SIM card in the iPad 1.  They claim they needed to, but I'm not so sure, because it makes no sense to me.  Another (micro) SIM card can be obtained from the nearest AT&T; store for free, though so stores may charge you $15.00, so check around.  Once the new SIM is inserted into the iPad 1 you can set-up and activate the 3G service on the device.Note: unused data package byte (for lack of a better term), cannot be rolled over from month-to-month.  Conversely, if your plan minutes run out during the month AT&T; will not automatically anoint you with more; more minutes can be purchased from the iPad 2, but it is a manual process.  However, the package will be renewed at the end of the 30 days, and continue to renew every 30 days unless stopped.Microsoft ActiveSyncSurprisingly, or maybe not so surprisingly, setting up the iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G to use Microsoft Exchange via Exchange ActiveSync is simple and easy; all told it took less the two minute to start receiving my business e-mail on the device, and there does not seem to be a limit to the number of devices associated with a given ActiveSync account.After I established the connection via ActiveSync I verified inbox functionality by reading, responding to, forwarding, and moving, e-mail.  The iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G even allows you to choose whether or not you want to download your business contacts and calendar; sweet!And once connected I am able to control password usage, minimum and maximum length, age, complexity, and expiration via an Exchange ActiveSync policy.  The policy can also control other aspect of the iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G's including third-party e-mail account creation; Windows SharePoint Services and Windows File Shares access; message size limits; attachment downloading, as well as a host of other security related features and functions.Word to the wise: Exchange ActiveSync policies, limited as they can be configured to disable a number of features on the device including camera, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi.  And yes, utilizing ActiveSync I can even wipe the iPad 64GB Wi-Fi/3G from the Exchange server, and as long as the tablet remains a part of the ActiveSync policy it will continue to wipe every time its powered on unless it is either removed from the policy or the check mark is removed from the radio button instructing ActiveSync to \"Perform a remote wipe to clear mobile device data.\"VPN AccessThe iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G has VPN access and it actually work quite well.  There are three options: L2TP, PPTP, or Cisco IPSEC. Like Exchange ActiveSync the VPN functionality was surprisingly easy to set up and get going, all one needs to know is what information to plug in and away we go!VPN took less than a minute to set up and configure, and once complete I was able to log into my company Intranet and thanks to some (free) Apps I was able to RDP into my workstation from the iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G; again, sweet!  Yes, the lack of makes maneuvering around the desktop somewhat challenging, but I could still get around the desktop and use it.  Note: there are paid versions of the Apps I used that offer crude mouse functionality.Like all of the network components on iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G VPN can be togged on and off at will.First Impressions:Like my personal iPad 1, I really, really, really, like the Apple iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G I have been testing.  Naysayers aside this thing is cool and I am happy to own one and even take it out in public!  I love being able to take my favorite book(s) with me when I am on the go, and I have the ability to stop at a Wi-Fi hotspot and plugging into the Internet in order to read the latest news, get the weather, run an application, etc.But, I really like the fact that I can take the lightweight iPad 64GB Wi-Fi/3G with me everywhere and still gain access to my pre-selected books, magazines, music and images, not to mention a seemingly endless supply of useful applications.  And let's not forget the Internet and business e-mail.Today while was waiting in line (yes I said line) for my dealership to open up so I could get me car serviced, I brook out my iPad 2 and started watch videos on Vevo; now how cool is that?Setting up Wi-Fi is easy enough; the antenna is always on and looking for new connection.  I set up the iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G to use the secure wireless setup at work; I typed in the pass-phrase via the incredibly handy keyboard and surfed the Internet; simple and easy.  Since I bought the iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G I have taken it out frequently to places that offer free Wi-Fi access and in only one instance did I have an issue connecting.  Nice!  And even then I effortlessly switched to 3G and, instance access.ConclusionsLike the iPad 1 before it the iPad 2 is the must have device of the decade, period!  Not a day goes by when I do not use it for something.  I love the portability of the device, the ease of use, the utilitarian nature of the unit, thanks in large part to the plethora of Apps that can be down loaded and utilized for the tablet.Is the iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G ready for the enterprise?  I say yes with a few caveats; chief among them is the inability of the tablet to truly manipulate Microsoft Office Applications without the assistance of the Documents-to-Go application ($9.99).  Second is the inability to truly mirror the iPad screen on a monitor, however with the Apple Digital AV Adapter that can be changed.  Video can be presented onto the screen--via an HDMI connection.  Lastly, is the lack of available USB port(s) or a memory card reader that will accept memory devices and help you keep files organized on-the-go, as well as the ability to truly turn the iPad into a mobile office.  As it stands now any document you want to work with must be e-mailed and then opened.  However, the iPad was never marketed as a laptop, or laptop replacement, so...Not that these problems cannot be overcome, but they are limitation that a laptop and even netbooks do not suffer from.  However, hands down, the Apple iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G is a performance winner, and one heck of an e-book reader! Yes, the entrance fee (799.00) is steep, and enterprise customers will have to think long and hard at the cost, however the iPad now has a certain \"cool\" factor that is hard to escape.  The more large enterprises adapt the iPad and find practical uses for it, the more popular it will become in the hall of corporate America.So far the iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G has more than lived up to my expectations and I have fun testing the limits of its ability to operate effectively in the enterprise and personal environments.", "Date": "March 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "ipad", "Author": "golfjunkie", "ReviewID": "R31IWMBWFQG0Q4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "just got it and am learning the ins and out of. due to have knee surgery soon and will be laid up for a while.

At the time, I really felt like I was \"biting the bullet.\"  I guess I just didn't think I would totally harness it's capabilities and only use it \"casually\" to write the occasional e-mail and surf the web.  To that end, I was right but as far as iPad generations are concerned, this device hits the sweet spot for what I use the tablet for (surfing the web, typing posts on Amazon, Tweeting and the occasional e-mail).  It's not too powerful for gaming per se but offers a silky smooth performance for business related functionality.  I even find that I don't need a BlueTooth keyboard as typing on it's screen in landscape mode is fast and easy enough.The only disappointment I have is that I paid for the cellular antenna.  I find that I mostly use this device in the home as a quick means of accessing the Internet where a WiFi access point is readily available.  I also take it with me out-of-town and for the most part, most hotels offer free WiFi so the cellular aspect of this device was money wasted.I am EXTREMELY pleased with this device's battery life.  It has been tested and found that the iPad 2 has the longest battery life of ALL the iPad generations up through the iPad 4 or \"iPad with Retina Display!\"  I truly believe this iPad second generation is the \"sweet spot\" in Apple's iPad lineup and that is why the Cupertino company is continuing to offer this device for purchase.  You don't really need the \"retina\" screen or the extra 500mb of memory for business tasks such as surfing the web or writing an e-mail.  This device will work flawlessly for those tasks.I can only express how happy I am that I purchased this tablet.  I will probably upgrade to the next iPad 5th generation, if it offers the robust WiFi AC and comes in an even slimmer, more elegant form factor.  I would recommend that users opt out of getting the cellular model unless they need to use the device in their cars for example.

The iPad has Bluetooth capabilities and I bought a Bluetooth keyboard to go with the iPad. I am still wrapping my head around the iPad and all its features. I really enjoy the iCloud, allowing me to sync up my iPhone and iPad. One of the first apps I downloaded was Pages and it has been fantastic. One of my biggest concerns regarding the iPad is the accessibility to remove documents, pictures,etc off of the iPad. There is no USB port, so I cannot hook up a zip-drive and due to the age of my Mac, I cannot download the iCloud app. So my only options are to email it to myself or go on my computer, go to the iCloud website, sign-on and get the document that way. When I brought this up to the Apple worker, he stated that the iPad is capable of printing directly from the iPad as an option as well. So that minimized my concerns. Over all, I am very happy with the decision I made, all my questions regarding the iPad have been able to be answered with a simple google-search.

I am currently a college student with plans to teach at the high school level, so I knew there would be endless amount of apps that will enhance my teaching in the future.  Right now, schools are exploring 1 on 1 iPads with their students because it makes it so much easier to grade and create assignments without the hassle of textbooks.  At home, I became sick of pulling out my four-year old Dell laptop to surf the web, watch videos, and just play around.  I wanted something that was smaller, easy to travel with, and it had to be a tablet.  Now, my Dell is fine for writing papers and all the other obligations that come with being a college student, but for an apple product as efficient and productive as the iPad, the price is tough to beat.  The iPad does not replace a desktop or a laptop, but it is a tremendous technological device that is user friendly and fun to play with.  Whether it is for leisure or work, there is an application for it.  What I like the most is that the ios apple system signals to the iPad when it is time for an update, making it up to par with the latest technology, which in turn betters its efficiency and productivity instantly.  With that being said, the ability to access the apple store is what sets it apart from other tablets.  Like I previously stated, there are apps for everything, and there are even several free apps that increase enjoyment and productivity.  It is a must buy for anyone interested in a tablet for both leisure and work obligations.I also have an iPhone 4 which I use very religiously, and the iPad 2 is an extension of that for me.  There are fewer apps available for the iPad, but that's not saying a lot, as there are still thousands available for it, as I find myself searching for a new app daily on the apple store.I have the 32GB edition and have not come close to filling up all the storage space!  I think it is the perfect size for somebody that doesn't constantly use it, but for someone that is on it daily at work or at home.  If you are going to count on it for everything you do in regards to a computer device, I would recommend the 64GB, but for me the 32GB has been great and I have not run into any problems to this point.  In addition, the device is very light, and you can hold it with one hand.  Definitely buy a protective case for your iPad, even though I have found it to be very durable.It is very nice to be able to use it like a mini computer.  You can access your personal files via google drive, drop box, etc. to increase productivity and bring your desktop or laptop files on the road with you.  One nice feature is that you can view websites with a mobile display or desktop display, serving for the benefit of all users.  Powerpoints, Word Documents, and PDF's are easy to view with the tap of the finger, which is very beneficial for someone in the business world or still in school.While I thoroughly enjoy my iPad 2, there are frustrations with it.  I find myself frustrated with the fact that I can't play Flash.  I like to watch videos, especially via twitter and facebook, and a lot of times I am unable to do so because of the software's inability to play flash.  In addition, I get frustrated because I wish I could make the iPad my only source of a computer.  I wish I could type on word and make a powerpoint as seamless as I do on my Dell.  I could do that, but on a college budget you don't want to be paying for an expensive app to make that a reality, but that's also the beauty of it.  You could download Microsoft Office products if you wanted to make it your go-to computer device.  One thing I would suggest is buying a keyboard for your iPad.  I went a year without one, but once I acquired a keyboard it made it that much more efficient to use!  So much easier to surf the web, iMessage, etc.In essence, if you're having a tough time deciding on buying an iPad or not, I would highly suggest buying one.  Now, if it is between a MAC laptop and an iPad, go with the laptop.  But, if you are in the market for a tablet and are looking for efficiency and productivity with a tablet, the iPad is a much because of the apple IOS software and the thousands of applications available via the apple store.  The slick design with endless amount of possibilities to increase production with an iPad puts it a head above the rest.  Once you begin using an iPad, you won't regret the purchase.", "Date": "March 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wonderfully limited", "Author": "D. Adams", "ReviewID": "R38DNSHOAQXTDT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I swore up and down I'd NEVER purchase an apple product, including things on itunes and the like.  So far, I have upheld that promise.  However, from a recent car purchase, I managed to obtain an iPad 2 16GB as a promotion.  Since my girlfriend had one and I did want some experience with iOS, I figured I'd begin poking around with it rather than simply selling it.The good...iOS is very easy to use and extremely straight forward.  Everything is laid out nicely and always a flick-tap away.  And most all programs work very well with the unit.  Software tends to be clean without too many bugs.Web browsing (just using Safari) is very smooth.  Most sites work well.  There's the ocational hiccup but it's more from using a touchscreen or the dreaded lack of Flash.  But soon enough, sites will probably migrate away from flash and on towards HTML5 (or simply pages designed for mobile/iPads).Usability, such as typing is very straight forward.  The keyboard is well thought out and works much better than any I've used.  The touchscreen is very responsive too and multi-touch works without a problem.Standby time is awesome and the unit is still functioning (IE gives you push notifications of Skype/AIM/etc)Given the standpoint of say someone's who's very unfamiliar with technology or who doesn't care to spend time \"configuring things\", this works great.  However, that is not who I am...The bad...You are extremely limited.  Being closed source, some apps simply are not available as they would be for Android or Windows-based tablets (and I mean x86, not Windows 8 RT)  Finding ways to print can be impossible, certain formats may be unreadable, and even simple things such as adding attachments in gmail may be hindered without installing additional apps.No Flash support!!!  As mentioned above, things are moving away from flash.  However, many sites still use flash there for some sites will not display correctly.  You are also limited on sites like Youtube, sometimes being unable to open the same videos you can open on a desktop environment (or even Android devices).Where are my files?!  Stuff just downloads.  You have no choice where to put them.  Download something you don't want to share then start browsing the photos you took using the camera, SURPRISE!Limited connectivity.  Expansion is limited to the propriatary apple plug on the bottom.  No OTG port, no standard USB, no microSD slot, no HDMI.  You can purchase some overpriced devices to give you these functions, but it would be nice to see some of them included.---All in all, it depends on the person whether or not one of these would fit your bill.  My girlfriend loves hers and almost never uses her PCs anymore.

They have about 13 movies, 64 apps (mostly educational apps for letter tracing, coloring, baby Spanish, and so on), 28 books, and even Netflix for the weekends. They learned how to use it VERY QUICKLY! Within a day of showing them how to do stuff no more than once, they've pretty much mastered it. I have an Otterbox Defender case on it because they do abuse it quite a bit. When watching Netflix I hook it up to the TV so they don't have to worry about holding it.

If you have PC and are used to Windows 7 you will feel the iPad is extremely limited on what you can do. The onscreen keyboard is very awkward for my small hands when typing because the letters are so spaced out. My WPM drop dramatically on the iPad but pairing it with a Bluetooth keyboard I imagine will fix that problem, except that I've yet to see one that comes close to my Windows Keyboard.

Instead I want to share my experiences living with the iPad 2 for about a year now.The main use for this device has been web surfing while sitting on the couch in front of the TV.  There's no doubt that we're moving to a multi-screen world and it's nice to be able to look something up on IMDB.com when watching something on TV or to check your email during a commercial break while watching a ballgame.  It is not my main web surfing machine, I don't have the best eyes and I'm addicted to my 24\" screen on my desktop, but the iPad does nicely for light web use.As an e-reader the iPad 2 isn't horrible, it's just nowhere near as good as a Kindle which means the only things that really get read on the iPad are books I have in PDF files, such as a Photoshop manual where having a nice color display really helps.  We've read some magazines on it, but the screen is really too small to make the a comfortable experience for me.  Your mileage may vary here as some people I know love reading magazines on an iPad.  For me, that experience will be better when there is an iPad that has about a 12\" screen size.One thing the iPad is really good at is playing videos.  With streaming apps getting better and better, like the HBO GO app, it's making the iPad more and more useful.  It's nice to be able to take your content anywhere you want in the house.  The screen is absolutely beautiful for playing video content, and once again for extended viewing I'd like a screen that's just a tad bigger than this current one.The performance of the iPad 2 is very nice, everything feels snappy and I've really never felt like the processor was being bogged down while using it.  It feels very nice in the hand and is very sturdy.There is no doubt about it, tablets are useful and they're entertaining but I don't see them ever replacing desktops or laptops for me.  I do a lot of design work though, so my needs are different than most people.  If you're looking for something to check email, surf the web and catch some video content then the iPad will be perfect for those needs.The bottom line is if you're going to get a tablet it's still hard to beat an iPad.", "Date": "November 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "iPad 2 WiFi", "Author": "baydogs", "ReviewID": "RSDSQK2UZUWTA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have never had Apple products except for an iPod.

That means that if I go to town, I really can not take it with me because I would be afraid if I set it down or took my eyes off of it for a minute it would get stolen. I can not walk around holding it all day, so pretty much I have to leave it at home. When I am at home, I have a computer in just about every room, so really dont know what I need the ipad for. It does not really do anything that a computer does not already do.When I travel, space in the carry on bag is a premium. I tried travelling once with this, and leaving the laptop at home, and it was a disaster. It will handle routine email, but if you need to edit a document, or interact with a web site that has flash, you are out of luck. I went to Africa with this instead of a laptop, and ended up on the phone for long periods trying to get someone back in the states to handle the business items I could not do on the ipad. So, when I travel if I already have to take an iphone and a laptop, what niche does the ipad fill?In optimizing my carry on for travel, I take an iphone, a small laptop, a good Sony camcorder, and the canon powershot elph.

The screen for movies and tv shows was fantastic though the wifi connection would keep dropping in the middle of streaming. The more I used the Fire the more I realized that it wasn't able to give me what I wanted.  It did not have a large enough amount of device itself storage space,I could not turn the backlight down low enough to make it comfortable for me to read, I could not download the BN reading app to read my BN book library, and the screen really wasn't large enough to comfortably browse the internet or read magazines.  I started looking at the Ipad 2 and after what I saw from a co-worker's IPAD I gifted my Fire to my sister and bought my own Ipad.  I absolutely love it!  It has given me everything that I wanted - most specifically the fact that I can have the Amazon reading apps and BN reading app on the device and can read both bookstore's library on the same device.  I had purchased the 16 mb but two days later upgraded to the 64 mb.  The backlight can be turned down to being almost off, browsing is great, reading my emails is easier now. The wifi connection is solid up in my room where the Fire would keep dropping the connection. I am amazed at how much you can do with this device with the different apps.  It is always with me!  True it is heavier than the Fire - it's more like reading a hardback book, but the print is big and the backlight is softer on the eyes.  Also true is the fact that I now cannot watch the Amazon Prime movies and tv shows, but ITunes has a lot to offer even though you have to pay for it.  Small trade-off in my opinion since I am mostly a book person - not a movie person.  Now if Amazon were to make a bigger Fire and take care of some of the issues I mentioned above - the Fire could definitely give the IPAD a run especially having the Instant Prime Video behind them but for now I would recommend the IPAD 2 over the Kindle Fire.  p.s.

Then Apple sold 15 million of them in just nine months, creating a whole new category of technology product. The iPad may have become, in the words of Steve Jobs, \"the most successful consumer product ever launched.\"It turns out that a lot of people saw the iPad's appeal: it's a supremely portable device that's well suited for checking your e-mail, surfing the Web, playing games, reading books and other stuff you get off the Internet, and even for getting work done. Kids and the elderly have embraced it.It's awfully hard to follow such a massive success, but that's the task set out for Apple's new iPad 2, which goes on sale Friday. At least the iPad 2 has this going for it: the original model caught the technology industry so flat-footed that only now are true competitors beginning to appear.Those competitors will now face a new iteration of the iPad, one that's faster, smaller, and lighter than the model introduced a year ago--all while retaining the $499 entry price that has proven all but impossible for Apple's competitors to match. It's almost unfair.A game of inches (and ounces)Call it Jobs's Law if you like: The latest version of any Apple product is likely to be thinner and lighter than its predecessor. And so it is with the iPad 2. The size difference between the original iPad and the iPad 2 may seem slight, but that's only because we're dealing with such small products to begin with. But for products this small, every ounce and fraction of an inch counts.The iPad 2 measures 7.31 by 9.5 by 0.34 inches, and weighs in at 1.33 pounds (in the case of the Wi-Fi-only version, that is--the AT&T; and Verizon 3G versions are .01 and .02 pound heavier). That means Apple shaved .17 pound off the Wi-Fi version and .26 to .27 pound off the 3G version. The iPad 2 is also .16 inch narrower, .06 inch shorter, and .16 inch thinner than the original iPad.A matter of small degrees, to be sure, until you consider the percentage change: the iPad 2 is roughly two-thirds the thickness of the original iPad, and 88 percent of its weight (83 percent when comparing 3G models). Pick up an iPad 2 after handling an original iPad, and you'll notice the difference right away.

Original iPad was my first one, which was bought as a gift for my friend and accidentally became a good entertainment for me and my wife. It's a great product, one of a very few gadgets I find myself truly love to use and feel the convenience and ease of use that rarely comes with a product that is sophisticated in its functionality and simple in its design. The reason I talk about my iPad in a iPad 2 review is that I want to give you a perspective of how I loved my iPad and all the good things about iPad has been improved and perfected, either in a subtle or substantive way, in iPad 2. The most obvious change I sensed were two things, a significant reduce in weight and a increase in processing speed. I have frequently found myself looking for iPad 2 at home to have a google search job done even though iPad is up front of my eyes.Another thing I came to appreciate both iPad and iPad 2 is their intuitive user interface. Quite opposite to a technology geek as I am, my mom has no knowledge in what an operating system is and has no idea how her order is fulfilled by a computing device, be it a pc or whatever else. This makes it very hard to explain to her how she should interact with the interface of an operating system. To her, opening up an application on a Windows desktop, in the start menu and Notification area are fundamentally different actions that take conceptually distinctive approaches to accomplish. Such understanding and confusion in opening different application have soon disappeared after only a few practices with the iPad home button. And now she is happily occupied herself with the Bakery Story app on a device easiest ever to use.", "Date": "December 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing product!", "Author": "Cindy", "ReviewID": "RU66S6UEGW3Z3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am typing this on my iPad.

The experience is much more enjoyable over all.  This is a non-biased review, I own a Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 as well (I may even be more of a fanboy toward Samsung, owning a 3d Blu ray player, 3D Led and LCD tv).  In my opinion, what makes the Ipad better than any of the Android tablets is the apps.  Apples app store has more apps than the Android market has to offer.  The Apple app store is also better looking and more organized (Android is getting better though).  Everything is clearly labeled for what device ie Ipad or Iphone/Itouch.  On the Android market its hard to tell whats what.  I have downloaded many apps that are intended for a phone.  I downloaded Guitar Hero 5 from the Android market and playing it was unbearable due to the tiny screen size, there was no option to enlarge the screen (Android needs to do a software update for this asap).  If you have a favorite Itouch game that you wanted to play on a bigger screen you can with the Ipad, you can increase the screen size).  In my opinion developers of apps are clearly making them first on Ipad.  For example, Netflix, Face Book, Onlive, and Boxee.  I would love to have a offical Face Book app for my Galaxy Tab. There is a Face Book app for Android but its ment for a phone and looks terrible on a tablet.  Why does it take so long for android to get them?  Even similar apps for both apple and android look better on Ipad, words with friends and Amazon Shopping app for starters!  Amazon you NEED to give Android the same app you gave Apple!  The one on my GT sucks.  Apple even has more demos of games...there usually called something like lite or free.  Apple has airplay which is cool if you own a AppleTV, I can play Angry Birds on my Samsung 3D LED 55 inch TV!  Yes Samsung has AllShare (Samsungs version of AirPlay) but for some stupid reason the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 doesnt have that app!  Why in the world does the first generation have it but the new one doesnt?  You cant even download it off the Samsung App store, maybe its coming w/Ice Cream Sandwich??  Heres basically my pros and cons for the Ipad:ProsEasy to useTons of Apps and better looking onesAirplayWay more accessaries and Cases (Im still waiting for a OtterBox case for my GT)ConsNo flashVery controlled device and you cant customize it like AndroidHeres a couple of things that I like better on the Galaxy tab.  On paper the GTs specs are better than Ipad 2.  You can customize it just about any way you want...but you need to be a lil tech savy.  Just about every game on Android is free and and they are full games (with ads)  Everyday Amazon gives you a free app!There is more than one market place to shop from (Android Market, Amazon, Samsung etc.)  Youtube looks cooler on Android...love the 3d honey comb looks!", "Date": "November 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wonderful", "Author": "T.

Seemless. If you had the first one and moved to the 2nd one, it's worth the move. I made a back up of the original and after going through iTunes everything just moved right over. Made a few tweeks here and there but otherwise it was painless.As far as the size goes, it's definently lighter than the first one and it's really lighter than the XOOM, which I had a chance to play around with on Saturday. Also due to the size, it feels like it swims around in the original's case so you definently will want a new one. With the new case, Apple really wants you to show off the sleekness of the device which is cool, but you want to take advantage of having AppleCare in case you accidentally drop it and it breaks. When things get smaller and slimmer, it always tends to feel more fragile. My complaint about the exposure is the back of the iPad which I can see being scuffed in a few weeks so I may get something to protect the back of it. Otherwise, this truly looks like a slate.It does feel speedier when loading up apps and as far as gaming goes, some like Infinity Blade and Shadow Guardian really gets a boost from the extra speed. They look much better and the loss of framerate is not as noticable as the iPad 1's.There is however still a bit of barely noticable stutter in some movies shown via Netflix when streaming which makes me hope that the next gen iPad has the Retina Display or something better for true on the go HD viewing.The cameras, while not the best ( I still don't see someone trying to do serious photography with this so this is not a big deal for me) still does very great with Face Time support. I demoed it a few times with one of my friends who also had the ipad 2 (as well as the iPhone 4) and people who has never seen Face Time in action were astounded. This was the video phone that we only imagined back in the 60s and 70s.There is still no SD Slot, no Thunderbolt support however the battery still holds a charge ( I just charged mine for the first time last night) and the screen is more bright and crisp than that of the XOOM.Apple has done a good job at taking the next step with the iPad and any competitor that had something coming out this year really need to take notes because if they don't move swiftly enough, Apple will dominate the tablet space in a similar fashion as they did the mp3 space with the iPod.If you had the first one ther are a few small surprises that you are in for, if this is your first one, you will be amazed about what you have missed out on.", "Date": "March 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Bad IOS 7", "Author": "Hong", "ReviewID": "R2O5VO42TUI06K", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My IPAD2 was good when I used IOS6.

I've dropped my iPad 2 on the same floor maybe 2x. It got a tiny dent in the aluminum frame. I have dropped this iPad on wood floors, ceramic tile, stone tile, concrete, asphalt, you name it (yes, grass, too). I do not, nor have I ever, had a case on it. Sure, the edges of the case are dented beyond repair, but the screen and (surprisingly) the back of the frame are scuff-free.BUT!!! However you drop it, DO NOT drop anything on it! My TV remote slipped from my hand less than 1 foot above my screen, and it obliterated the home button, which I now keep in my pocket. I found it extremely ironic :)The screen is impossible to scratch, however. Not gouge, but scratch. Since it's broken, I ordered a new screen. I decided to see how tough the screens are by scratching one with a nail (as in hammer and nail, not finger nail). It could not scratch it. Since I don't remember much of the Mohs Hardness scale, and I lack a diamond, it's somewhere between a 3 and 10 hardness.- Personalization .1/5Apple has too much restricted customer customization of this product. As soon as you get this product, JAILBREAK IT! Jailbreaks are not illegal unless you install illegal sources. If you don't like any aspect of Apple's software designs, from there being a six-icon limit on the dock, to being able to run all your applications in windows or have Siri on the iPad, Jailbreak it. 99.9382% of the time you'll find the tweak you're looking for.- Size 2.3/5Frankly, 2 years ago when I was 13 I was flipping out to get such a big electronic toy. Now I think it's too freaking big. If you want a size that is good for presentations, yet still retaining good mobility, go with an iPad. If you want something you can stick in you're jacket pocket yet still be able to read, get something nearby the size of a Kindle Fire, even though I personally think iPad is 700x better.- Battery Life 5/5...I sometimes sit there and watch the battery drain, because I'm afraid if I open an app it will die (obviously this is at maybe 5-30% battery life). Yet sometimes I've found I can play for 4-5 hours, on a 3D game, no less, from 100% to dead.- Display ...The part we've all been waiting for...Honestly, I'd have to say... 4.6/5I thought the display was absolutely stunning. That is, until I saw the iPad 3. I started seeing minor (MINOR!!!!!!) flaws on edges. This was mostly in a few particular apps designed for both iPhone and iPad, most of the other apps were just fine.If you don't mind not having 3,100,000 pixels, take 786,432 pixels instead. You won't notice a difference, so long as you avoid iPad 3's.- Versatility 5/5I use this for school, homework, games, browsing the web to buy a new screen, FaceTiming with friends, staying up-to-date with friends, you name it.

The iPad's various styli, with their resistant, rubbery \"nubs,\" still leave much to be desired).  Yet, overall there would appear to be few if any viable alternatives at this stage.  Apple was first to the parade and, according to practically every review of the latest model (including that most popular consumer's magazine), continues to remain in the top position.The primary advantage of the Apple 2--from my perspective--would appear to be the lighter weight and more compact size.  Personally, I found the iPad 1 to be hot and heavy compared to my Air 11\", which I now use for practically all of my computing.  So be sure to take note of screen size and overall weight of any other device you may be considering before ordering.  Also, note that the highest-rated tablet on Amazon (the Toshiba) has yet to be released!  If you're considering it, it would seem overly hasty if not reckless not to wait for it to \"test out\" on the market for a few months.As for the iPad, the Flash controversy proved a non-issue for my wife and me.  The lack of certain ports--for HDMI, USB, display, etc.--was never anything that couldn't be addressed and fixed with a readily available adapter.  Finally, look for any other machine that comes close to the iPad in terms of the galaxy of available \"apps.\"  The lack of a keyboard (true of most any tablet) can also be addressed--but now we're getting close to a Macbook Air, which strikes me as the more practical purchase in the first place.In short, there's every reason to spring for another iPad (if you like the concept in the first place) and a number of reasons to withhold purchase of any other brand.  But a caveat: this is one of the few times that I've found a product sold through Amazon to be significantly higher in cost, even without sales tax, than the same product purchased through Apple Store.[As a musician, I've found a reason to like this device: it can be loaded up with musical scores (several life-times' worth) and set on a stand or piano ledger, the equivalent of a giant-sized cabinet full of notated music contained within a thin, easily readable and navigable tablet.]", "Date": "June 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Big money for corporate giants", "Author": "felipe echevarria \"Felipe Echevarria\"", "ReviewID": "RZ8UCID1546VC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Just bought a brand new 16GB iPad2 off Craigslist, and have some general comments...I found it quite difficult to get set up, it seems you have to connect the iPad to a PC or Mac and go from there (you get no manual, just a stupid little card with minimal info on it), which meant lots of figuring things out. Just the iTunes image alone that first appears on the screen when turning it on for the first time makes you go \"huh?\"  Maybe the Jr. High kids can blast through it, but it's harder for me (I'm 52) and I have a fair amount of computer experience.You also have to input your credit card info! This means one thing...this machine is designed purposely to be a money hog for Apple and entertainment giants. It will have you buying all kinds of apps and music and entertainment to download from iTunes. Another step closer to being an automaton.No USB port means Apple wants to control accessories and what you can input/output with the iPad, and that leaves you guessing, finding workarounds, and buying more stuff. But sure, it's also to minimize complications with external devices.This machine is amazing, though, I got it for showing my work and upcoming interactive apps at conventions (I'm an artist). I can now carry around a portfolio of my work without the bulk. But to get photos on it properly you will have to buy an application for it. There are ways of getting photos uploaded without iTunes and buying photo apps (like emailing them to yourself and downloading them from there), but then the photo app it comes with leaves you without much capability to manipulate and organize them and put them in folders. There are literally no buttons/selections to control things with. This is obviously another manipulation to make you buy something more.Lastly, if you want accessories (or even the iPad itself), go to Amazon or Craigslist, Ebay, friends, family--and buy them used, don't fork out $50 for a new protective cover, you can find a lot of these things used or cheaper than buying from Apple or manufacturers that don't care about the Earth and design products that end up too soon in the landfill.Overall it's a cool machine, but like me, with the way corporations/manufacturers plan and manipulate your pocketbook you might one day start to realize you're just a cog in the money machine for these corporate entities.Well, someone had to say it.", "Date": "August 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great when it works", "Author": "Darrell E.

If you're still debating between the iPad 1 and the iPad 2 check out my review of the first generation iPad right here on Amazon to see a discussion of its strengths and weaknesses with a number of people commenting (both positively and negatively) over the past 11 months.Let me begin by saying this upfront, I don't work for Apple, I don't own Apple Stock, and whether you buy an iPad, Xoom, a laptop or a pad of paper and pencil I don't get anything for writing this. I'm not an Apple \"fanboy\" although I can give credit where credit is due and lately Apple has deserved a lot of credit for some of their products.Physical CharacteristicsThe iPad 2 is absurdly thin. More importantly than it's thinness is its tapered edge which feels more natural in your hand. One of the biggest complaints about the original iPad was it really wasn't tremendously comfortable to hold for long periods at a time. For a tablet device designed to be held, that's a pretty big deal. Apple really has done an amazing job of cramming everything into an even smaller space than before and the difference is really noticeable when you're holding the device. In addition to the tapered edge, Apple managed to reduce the overall weight of the iPad 2. That might not seem like a huge deal to most, especially when you consider the weight difference isn't tremendous when you're already under 2 pounds, but I spend a good part of my day holding the iPad in my hands and the weight difference is surprising by the end of the day. The first generation isn't heavy by any means, but the iPad 2 outshines it.New and \"Improved\"Apple doubled the RAM in the iPad 2 from 256MB to 512MB. What does that mean? For most casual users, probably not a whole lot. There is a performance bump that everyone will see the effects of in things like loading times for webpages that are open in the background, but 256MB was sufficient for most daily use and games. If you're planning to use your device for some of the more graphically intense games the iPad 2 does offer a better method of graphics processing that'll help deliver faster images with fewer jerky movements. If you're just playing Angry birds and reading e-mail you're not going to know the difference.The screen is the same for all real purposes. It is technically a \"new\" part in that it isn't identical to the old, it's a bit thinner and more efficient, but it's the same resolution. The Glass is thinner though, and this amounts to a fair bit of the weight loss from one generation to the next. In playing with the device it seems surprising but despite feeling lighter it actually feels more sturdy in your hands. I still wouldn't suggest dropping it, but if it were to fall the iPad 2 certainly feels like it might stand a better chance to survive. Try not to drop it though.The addition of 2 cameras was expected. Some were a bit surprised to see the first generation released without the cameras. Whether it was for a price point consideration, or a means to get people to upgrade, Apple held off until iPad 2. The cameras do a reasonable job, but they're not going to replace a dedicated digital camera, or really even the camera on your phone for most still images. The cameras do a substantially better job with video, and FaceTime is probably one of the best reasons to get the iPad 2 over the original iPad. For those who might not be familiar, FaceTime is Apple's face to face conferencing system, kind of like Skype, or if you'd rather, kind of like the Jetson's TV/Phone. With the push of a button you can be having a face to face chat with a loved one just about anywhere in the world (provided they're on a wireless network at the time). FaceTime doesn't work over 3G natively (it can be used over a wifi connection created by a 3G device however) so you're not going to be able to use it in your car anytime soon. This is probably a good thing though. It is incredibly easy to use and if you know other people with an iPad 2, iPhone 4, or Mac it's a lot of fun.Smart Covers aren't really \"smart\" but they're really very useful. Not only do they provide a stylistic enhancement of the device, but they serve a practical and functional purpose of doubling as a screen protector and stand in 2 configurations. You can find them in a variety of colors and from third market suppliers, and it's a safe bet that more will be out soon to capitalize on the magnetic sensors in the iPad 2. It's unfortunate that this same feature can't somehow be retrofitted to the iPad 1, I wouldn't have thought a case would be a compelling reason to consider a product over it's competitor, but these covers are really so useful it's hard to understand why they've not been there since the beginning.Multitasking SupportOne of the biggest knocks against the iPad when first released was the lack of native multi-tasking support. Jailbreakers added the feature quickly and Apple soon realized it would be a requirement for any future device's success and released an OS update that included the feature. The iPad 2 capitalizes on that progress and takes it a step further with the increased RAM enabling more open applications to be suspended at once, and the time to open or close an application has improved as well. That said, even the first generation managed to open and close apps faster than most people would be used to on their computers, so while this is an improvement it's more akin to showing off.AppsOne thing that Apple has clearly the advantage in for the moment is app availability. The App store has close to 70,000 iPad specific Apps, all of which will work on the iPad 2. The new cameras will undoubtedly see this list expand rapidly, as will the inclusion of a gyroscope for gaming and motion based uses. There are also a substantial number of professional applications ranging from document creation to photo editing and vector drawing. Chances are if you can dream it, there's an App for that (and if not you might want to get started on one to fill in the gap). The Android market is making a strong showing, and ultimately it'll likely be a strong competitor, for now it still has a ways to go, but any potential buyer should consider the strength of the application market before buying a tablet.Pros:Weight. Seriously. The minimal weight of this thing is by far the most impressive feature about it in my opinion. It seems to defy physics and logic that so much could be in such a small space working that hard for that long.Battery Life. From full to dead my iPad 2 went just over 11 hours with the movie Robin Hood showing twice during that time, the screen at half brightness, wifi turned on, an Angry Birds marathon and a good portion of a book in ibook. That's better than a work day and that's constantly on.Books. This is definitely a Pro, but reading itself could go either way. The great benefit to the iPad is having access to Google Books, ibook, Nook, and Kindle. This allows for some comparison shopping and price competition (although for the most part they're all usually about the same). Reading in the evenings in bed is great as the back light means you don't have to worry about keeping others awake, but the glass screen causes some glare trouble when trying to read outside or near a sunny window. If you're an avid outdoor reader the Kindle might still be your best bet.Cons:Still no dedicated USB support. While there is a camera add-on that allows for certain USB devices to be used there is no option for mass storage. Some of the Android Tablets allow for this and if you find yourself wanting to use your tablet as a standalone storage device this might be something to consider. The device can read from certain flash drives though, but is largely limited to photo and video files. Jailbreaks offer solutions to this, but those come with their own issues as well.Still no dedicated SD card slot. This is troublesome on two fronts. First, if you want to import pictures from your camera you have to have an adapter which is just one more thing to carry around. Second, the lack of expansion means you're limited to what you purchase in terms of storage. I purchased a 32GB iPad last time and never filled it up completely, so for me capacity wasn't an issue. If you want to be able to have your entire movie collection with you though... you may want to consider whether the iPad 2 can meet your space requirements.HDMI output. Really this is a Pro and a Con. The iPad does allow for HD output over HDMI but again it requires an adapter. All of these adapters are additional purchases for features that some tablets offer built in. This can be a pain, but then again if you're not likely to ever use HDMI Output then you're not paying for something you won't use.No Flash Support. This is becoming less and less of an issue as the internet and web developers are moving away from Flash for many websites, but there are a lot still out there relying on Adobe's Flash to run properly (including a lot of web based games). Before you pick a tablet consider what kind of websites you frequent and try and determine if they are Flash driven or not. If they are you may really want to consider something from the Android offerings as it is expected that they'll have at least some Flash support.If you're in the market for a tablet device the iPad 2 should definitely be on your short list. If you're uncertain it is always best to go and play with these things hands on first if you can. Best Buy is a good place for that, so are Verizon Stores since they have the Xoom and 3G iPad. Don't get pulled into the hype and mania that comes with an Apple release. They're exciting and new, and they're impressive enough to warrant some excitement, but it will die down and there will be other products that prove a strong competitor to the iPad 2. If you're looking for right now though, this is probably your best bet. I gave the device 4 stars, as I did the iPad 1. I did this in contemplation of the features offered by competitors that are absent from the iPad, most notably the requirement for adapters for USB/SD/HDMI. While these features are there, they aren't as convenient as in other tablets. With that in mind I firmly believe that the iPad more than makes up for this in usability, reliability, and design and in those areas far exceeds its current competitors.", "Date": "March 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Evolutionary not revolutionary...but that was expected", "Author": "Dredded Deuce \"Dredded Panthyr\"", "ReviewID": "RVXU4HZNUZ5MB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So after picking it up Friday and playing around with it most of the weekend, what's the final word? Seemless. If you had the first one and moved to the 2nd one, it's worth the move. I made a back up of the original and after going through iTunes everything just moved right over. Made a few tweeks here and there but otherwise it was painless.As far as the size goes, it's definently lighter than the first one and it's really lighter than the XOOM, which I had a chance to play around with on Saturday. Also due to the size, it feels like it swims around in the original's case so you definently will want a new one. With the new case, Apple really wants you to show off the sleekness of the device which is cool, but you want to take advantage of having AppleCare in case you accidentally drop it and it breaks. When things get smaller and slimmer, it always tends to feel more fragile. My complaint about the exposure is the back of the iPad which I can see being scuffed in a few weeks so I may get something to protect the back of it. Otherwise, this truly looks like a slate.It does feel speedier when loading up apps and as far as gaming goes, some like Infinity Blade and Shadow Guardian really gets a boost from the extra speed. They look much better and the loss of framerate is not as noticable as the iPad 1's.There is however still a bit of barely noticable stutter in some movies shown via Netflix when streaming which makes me hope that the next gen iPad has the Retina Display or something better for true on the go HD viewing.The cameras, while not the best ( I still don't see someone trying to do serious photography with this so this is not a big deal for me) still does very great with Face Time support. I demoed it a few times with one of my friends who also had the ipad 2 (as well as the iPhone 4) and people who has never seen Face Time in action were astounded. This was the video phone that we only imagined back in the 60s and 70s.There is still no SD Slot, no Thunderbolt support however the battery still holds a charge ( I just charged mine for the first time last night) and the screen is more bright and crisp than that of the XOOM.Apple has done a good job at taking the next step with the iPad and any competitor that had something coming out this year really need to take notes because if they don't move swiftly enough, Apple will dominate the tablet space in a similar fashion as they did the mp3 space with the iPod.If you had the first one ther are a few small surprises that you are in for, if this is your first one, you will be amazed about what you have missed out on.", "Date": "March 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "I Hate Apple with a Passion", "Author": "chunkeeone", "ReviewID": "R1HEIGA05U9X3V", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I received my iPad 2 and loved it for a few months.

It started ghostwriting and not responding correctly to where it was being touched... So I checked out my warranty situation and of course, being that it was a present that was bought months previous to my taking ownership of it (via a belated birthday gift) but never taken out of the box, not that that matters to Apple, I was told I would have to pay full price to replace the touch sensor which I found out recently is such a serious problem with Apple that they (if they cared about their consumers, that is) should have recalled it long ago..

PC's all my life and i knew nothing about apple products except that they were expensive and the most pretentious people liked them. and i stand by that.well.....lets just say that the iPad 2 is just a amazing little machine. it took me awhile to figure out the whole system...it is different from a PC and not google-based. it is a transition...if your like me i can tell you honestly its a transition you would do well for yourself by taking.i am gonna compare the Xoom to the iPad 2 because it might be helpful and when i made my purchase i noticed alot of reviewers did the same...1- looks. iPad.its stunning. absolutely gorgeous. its art. no doubt. the Xoom is cool indeed, but the iPad has it hands down. dont mind paying more for that at all. you live once.2- speed. its incredibly fast. insane. and gotta give it up to the Xoom too...when it was running at full speed it was incredible too. both equal in my opinion.3- ease of use. Xoom has it all over the iPad 2. coming from PC's its a seamless transfer. google-based. tabs. etc...no worries. the iPad is completely new so the challenge is teaching yourself...BUT once you learn the way...MY GOD IT IS AWESOME.4- accessories and apps. iPad. all the way. no doubt. none. the apps are incredible. the accessories are ridiculously expensive for what they are but once you hold them...the quality is there. the Xoom has no real acessories to speak of..and the apps available are few and far between. that said...i didnt have any problem with normal use of the Xoom and i understand more are on the way...which is awesome.5- battery life. same. both rock. ten hours.6- screen. iPad 2. hands down. amazing and beautiful. the screen doesn't get nearly the amount of fingerprints as the xoom and the pictures are gorgeous. this is a non-issue. the iPad looks better in every way.7- ease of use. Xoom. really easy to use. intuitive.8- support. iPad. AppleCare is the best thing ever. ever. forget about it.9- photos. Xoom. the ability to store photos into catagories and switch them around is awesome. the iPad you just have one big place to put all of your pics.that said 10- cameras. iPad.11 - cost. about the same. iPad maybe more with the applecare.and finally...12- set up. Xoom. all the way. plug it up and your good to go. the iPad you gotta sync with a PC and load up iTunes and jump a bunch of annoying hoops. that done though...MAN is it awesome.sooo....its a big purchase. i think both machines will do right by anyone. but if your looking for something artistic. dramatic. tough and secure go for the iPad. if your looking for something familar, comfortable and easy...the Xoom is for you.in conclusion....my iPad 2 is awesome. im glad i took the plunge and have no regrets. every day im loving it more and more...its amazing.im becoming pretentious now. i find myself silently judging others by their tablets and computers. i do and its awful. if you choose to get a iPad you will do the same thing. you need to be prepared for it....its a glorious feeling!!!!!

This Ipad 2 is very easy to use and can be used for almost anything. Whether you are at home and just want to play games or watch Netflix or if you are at school and want to take notes, this Ipad can do just about anything. Many people have consumed and reported their personal experiences and for the most part if you own an Ipad 2 you cooler than everyone else who doesn\u2019t own one. People will look at you at work or in class and envy you since they don\u2019t have one. That is a fact! I encourage everyone to own one of these. It is a purchase I do not regret and I would recommend it to anyone. My whole family owns one from my sister to my cousins and nephews and we are all satisfied with the Ipad 2. It works as a mini computer on the go and you will love it. This item is fun to use and is very appealing. The size and weight of it allows you to be able to take anywhere with you. It is much thinner and it has been created to be much faster than other tablets. You will not have to wait for 10 minutes to allow it to turn on , you will be guaranteed fast service from this apple product. There are also multiple languages from which you can choose from to The display of the Ipad is just phenomenal. It\u2019s glossy widescreen allows you to see everything very nicely. There\u2019s no doubt the resolution quality is the best! You would want to take pictures and videos everywhere you go. This Ipad has also been created with front and rear cameras so you don\u2019t have to only take pictures of others but you can take pictures of yourself. How awesome! So if you and your friend want to take a picture but there is no one around that can do you the favor, there is no need to worry about it because you have this ipad. Adjust the camera to face you and snap away. You can also fix the picture by adding filters or purchasing apps that allow you to fix a picture in anyway whether its adjusting the color and brightness or adding funny stickers or borders. There are thousands of apps you can find that are fun and very useful. Many apps you must pay for but they are usually very cheap and definitely worth it. There are also many free apps that are your usual apps. The app store has thousands of apps specifically for ipads. This allows you to have an enjoyable time when using your ipad. When purchasing your ipad, your item comes with free built in apps. These apps include the camera, calendar, clock, safari and many more general apps you need on a everyday basis. Surfing the web on your Ipad can not get any easier. It was created so that everyone can easily learn from your 4 year old sister to your 70 year old grandmother. The buttons on the exterior of the ipad include the home, volume, and silence key and the hold button. The power and battery life of the ipad is excellent. You can go hours of surfing the web or playing games without having to keep charging it everyday.  For example, I recently went on a trip to San Francisco which took 6 hours. I watched movies on the way there and movies on the way back and didnt have to chrage it during my vacation. It was amazing to be able to use it for so long and not have to keep charging it on my trip. On my trip I was also able to factime my brother who was back at home. With the ipad you can videochat and factime anyone at anytime as long as you have wifi. This allows you to have contact with someone you havent seen for a while. It allows you to be able to see someone while talking to them at the same time. This for me is the best part of the ipad since It clearly allows me to see my brother who lives far away from me. The Apple Ipad 2 is an excellent product overall. If you are still debating whether or not to purchase an Ipad 2 you should go and play with one hands on first before purchasing. You can go to best buy or an Apple store to witness this marvelous item in action.I give the Ipad 2 five stars because I love it.

Goulian", "ReviewID": "R2AO4MUOPGPZWV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After owning a Kindle 3 for a year, then a Kindle Fire for 6 months, I am now the proud owner of an iPad 2. I am also in a position to compare the two tablets without any bias at all.First, why the switch? The Kindle Fire is a great tablet, much better than the Kindle 3 in my opinion because of the apps, the small size, the backlit screen, and the Silk browser. And for many months now I have compared the iPad at a distance to the Kindle Fire, and I kept coming back with \"why would I want to spend $500 on an iPad when I can get a Fire for $200? I already own a laptop. Why would I need so much functionality in an eBook reader?  The iPad solves a problem that I do not have.\"But the advantages of the iPad only become apparent once you own one. That's when the large screen makes you realize how much you squinted at the Fire's smaller screen. How much smoother the Safari browser works than the Silk browser. And how much better the selection of apps are on the iPad.So, once the new iPad came out and the iPad 2 price dropped by $100, I found myself thinking seriously about it. And before I knew it, I had one. And I like it. I like it a lot.Now, I am still a huge Amazon fan and have no intention of leaving Amazon, so the thought of reading books and watching Amazon Prime videos on a non-Kindle device filled me with a bit of trepidation. Can it all work as nicely on the iPad as it does on the Kindle Fire? The answer is \"Yes\", with one rather large exception: video. Unfortunately videos (TV shows & movie's) downloaded from Amazon require Adobe Flash which Apple does not support on its mobile devices, so that was my first disappointment. But that's been my only disappointment so far and it turns out that it's not a huge problem at all. All of the other pluses of the iPad make up for that. There is plenty of video for the iPad: it's all on iTunes, and a lot of it is free. The Kindle reader works just fine on the iPad 2, in fact its nicer with the large screen.  Book prices on Amazon and Apple appear to be identical. Although the iPad 2 is larger and heavier than the Fire, it's not that much heavier to be a hindrance and I don't see it being any more difficult to slip into my travel bag. Battery life is about the same. But for sure the apps available on the iPad are a welcome sight compared to the Kindle, in both the quantity and quality. This is really where the scale tips heavily in Apple's favor. Sure, Android has thousands of apps available, but Amazon does not let you have them on the Kindle. You are restricted to only downloading the apps that Amazon has approved for the Kindle Fire, and that turns out to be a disappointingly small number of apps, many of which are of mediocre quality.  I would find myself eagerly searching the Kindle app store for the same apps that I enjoy on the iPhone, only to find that they are simply not available for the Kindle Fire. Apps like Skype, Evernote, TED, PBS,  Dropbox, Voxer, SayHi, WeightWatchers mobile, and plenty more. Another experience that is much better on the iPad is watching the news and documentaries while I walk on my treadmill. The bigger screen is a huge improvement and with all the great apps for news and shows, there truly is no end to what you can watch. Add to all of this the microphone, front & back cameras (I got the Wi-Fi only model), accelerometer, GPS and compass and you now have a much more exciting tablet experience. I also found the Silk browser to be clunky and unresponsive at times on the Fire with tabs & buttons that are small and difficult to press , while iPad's Safari is easier to use and has not even hiccupped. Could it be my wireless router? The distance to the router has not changed, just the tablet, so I call that a Silk issue.So what really changed between the Kindle Fire and the iPad? Me. I thought all I wanted was a good eBook reader and for the last couple of years, the Kindle more than sufficed. But I found out that my needs and expectations have changed and I what I really want now is great tablet. And that's the iPad, hands down.Correction: The wi-fi only model does not have a GPS module, but the location services and digital compass can still show your location for apps that need it. Interestingly, turn-by-turn directions in Mapquest work fine, as long as you have a wifi signal, but unless you have a good wifi signal in your car, GPS is pretty useless.", "Date": "April 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great purchase", "Author": "Mznurse", "ReviewID": "R3VRGKX5KB3PCM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have multiple apple items.

The only thing I have had any trouble with at all was installing the new update. I would recommend installing it before putting any media or info on it. It just makes the process alot longer and more frustrating. Reguardless, I think Apple has outdone themselves with this device. It is more than just an oversized/ overpriced iPod. I love my iPad.ps.

But with the newly redesigned exterior, upgraded hardware, and my wife desperately wanting one more than I did, I finally ended up getting one.  So far we are tremendously satisfy and uses it more often than we ever thought we would.The new iPad 2 is slimmer, sleeker, faster, and lighter than it's predecessor while retaining the same display size.  Upgraded with a faster processor, it runs a lot smoother and able to multitask more quickly without getting overheated or apps crashing.  The traditional aluminum back casing makes its return with a sexy sleek taper design.  I always feel the sense of durability and toughness, just an overall very solid constructed piece of work whenever I'm handling it, even when dropped, multiple times.  Both higher megapixel cameras front and back allowing better quality photos, video, and greater facetime moments with family and friends.  These are just the major improvements over the original that I feel is already worth it's purchase.I've tried several different tablets and non is as user friendly and simple to navigate as the iPad 2.

I learned my lesson to pick and choose what I feel most comfortable using and to not be so stubborn about supporting a company that I dislike.  I should say the only thing I dislike about Apple is their computer operating system.  It's not an operating system for me.  I don't feel comfortable using it and it is definitely much more boring than using a Windows operating system that has a gazillion more software written for it.  I'm a Windows guy, grew up with Windows and dabbled with Linux.  I tried to jump on to Linux band wagon long time ago and attempted to stick to it.  It was after several years that I realized Linux was likely not going ANYWHERE on the consumer side for the foreseeable future.  Linux will always be known as a great server operating system, reliable SAMBA share server, etc, but it will never surpass Windows or OS X.  Even Mac/OS X is popular among the consumers and look what this operating system is built on top of!  That being said, it does me no good to hate Apple just because I feel like it.  I bought their iPad 2 device and have been using it since it's initial launch (I did not buy it the first day of launch online, but definitely 3-4 days afterwards).  This device has been great since I purchased it the first day.  Yes, it does not support FLASH, but I realized this before I decided to buy the iPad.  The screen is sharp, the performance is fast and the screen touch is extremely responsive.  The battery life is really good compared to other devices (e.g. iPhone 4s, iPhone 3Gs).  It is a device for casual usage, you browse, you email, you do stuff for leisure.  I sometimes forget to connect the iPad to the charger over night, but I have not had to charge this device for 2-4 days, depending on how heavy I use it.  It's not like the iPhone where I MUST recharge it each night or else it will DEFINITELY run down the battery to critical level.  Granted, it's the WiFi version so it does not have the techno-complication of having to deal with 3G.  iPad 2 is very stable and robust.  I am definitely the type of person who would take every opportunity to criticize an Apple device, but I have to admit that I have had absolutely no problems using this iPad device.  I have no experience with any other tablet device in the market, but if you are wondering if you should get one or if this is going to be a reliable device, I can definitely say it has been super reliable in all phase it was made for since I received it.  Again, it does NOT support Flash, so be aware of this before you purchase it.  It's light weight, does a LOT of tasks that you can do from a computer and has a whole ton of apps available.  If you want to compare it to a computer, don't try to completely compare it apples to apples (pun intended), because it still isn't as \"flexible\" as a computer.  My laptop has a built in physical keyboard and mouse, I do not have to purchase a separate keyboard or mouse like I would have to for a iPad (you have to use the virtual keyboard on the iPad).  I can truly multitask on my Windows laptop, on the iPad it's \"semi-multitask\" at most.  The iPad cannot come close to the laptop's 8GB memory, 750 GB hard drive laptop that can run VMWare, play online multi-player games, store files where-ever I want, in whatever directory I created.  There are SO many things I can do on a laptop that the iPad currently cannot do... so unless you ONLY browse, type a few emails, make a few purchases from Amazon/eBay or other available stores and maybe chat occasionally online... then don't expect this iPad to really replace a laptop or desktop (I'm typing this review via laptop as it faster to do than on an iPad).  One negative about the iPad, but it's not Apple's fault, the Apps that people sell may be written for the iPad only or for iPhone only but sometimes written for both.  This means that if the app was designed specifically for the iPhone and you buy it... then it will not LOOK optimized for the iPad since the screen size on the iPad will make it stretched.  If you purchase the app for the iPad, then it may not even be available for the iPhone (I haven't seen an app for the iPad available for the iPhone).  Often they sell TWO different versions of the same app for both devices, so you have to pay double the amount to use them on your two devices.  Again, this review is about the iPad device, not about how the apps are developed, so overall, the iPad 2 is awesome... highly recommended for a tablet purchase.", "Date": "November 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Impressed with IPAD", "Author": "Miguel Gaspar", "ReviewID": "R21MQI1MA6TL7E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had in the past an Iphone, and was not keen to buy one again until I was challenged to try the IPAD2.

This is WIFI only and well, my WIFI is constantly disconnecting!! It's not just my home network, but anywhere I go!! Thought maybe it was just me, but is asked hubby how his was since I bought them both at the same time last week, and his is doing the same thing!! Ugh...ORIGINAL REVIEW:I'm an Android fan and when my Android crashed, I decided hey I'll buy not one, but two of these things!  Ugh...my hubby loves it, I hate it :(Pros:It is super fast!The battery life is unbelievable! Hubby played games for three hours straight and lost only 20% of the battery life!  I spent hours downloading apps and using them and had the same result. I've been using it non stop since 7am and it's now 10:30am, played my games, used Facebook and a few apps, and now reviewing...I'm at 75%. My android would have been dead long ago as well as the other cheap tablet we have.Cons: my opinion keep that in mind...It's too much of a hassle typing when you're used to a smaller screen. I'm a very fast typist, and this thing is just too big for my liking. Did I know the size? Duh! I may return it for a smaller Android though. If you need a large screen, this is perfect! My mother in law and hubby love it, but again, if you like the smaller screens, it's hard to get accustomed to.Takes FOREVER to set up! Omg, you have to create an IPad ID, an Apple ID, confirm this, confirm that, ugh...Finding apps seems to be mission impossible!  I go to the store, they aren't there!  But if I go to the browser and search, it gives me the Apple download and then I get it. So where the heck was it hiding??All in all, this is one of those 50/50 deals, either you're an IPad lover, or an Android lover. If you love Androids, don't bother.

It runs the latest IOS 7 and apps perfectly. The battery still holds a full charge, and all of the buttons and features still work (I could not say the same about my 4 year old Ipod Touch...).I use it primarily for web browsing, email, Facetime and e-books.This model does NOT have a retina display. Although Retina is nice it makes no difference in day to day use, including viewing photos. So what if I can see dots close up? I am certainly not bothered by them.Sure its fun having the most up to date toy, but having the new Ipad Air would not enhance the enjoyment that I get from the device one bit.Still, it seems like chutzpah for Apple to sell an old model for $400, so if I were in the market, I would look at used/refurbished models.

Rhoades \"Zane\"", "ReviewID": "R3TQ8M8P4ZQASS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I ordered this particular model because I lost the one I received as a gift.  I don't want the person who gave it to me to find out about the loss.  Also, I cannot afford a new one from Apple.  I chose the vendor Sikksound because of the positive reviews.  I am conditionally pleased with my choice.  The iPad I received was in pristine condition, with an Apple box, charging cord and fast charge plug.  It also came with a textured protective backing.  I discovered that the iPad had been used in Italy because of the formatting and information I found in the settings.  After a series of very courteous and helpful e-mail conversations with Sikksound, I was able to resolve the formatting issues.However, I warn purchasers of used AT&T; iPads of an expensive and cumbersome complication.  AT&T; uses a SIM card to enable cellular data usage.  When sold by Apple, a new AT&T; iPad comes with a SIM card which allows for periodic data usage.  In other words, a cellular data plan may be purchased through the iPad for a month, and then cancelled.  When cellular data is needed again, one can simply by more data for that month, and so on.  Because of it's Italian heritage the iPad I received was equipped with a SIM card incompatible with AT&T; in the U.S.  In order for the iPad to use cellular data, a new AT&T; SIM card was required.  A local AT&T; store installed one without alerting me to the $36 fee, and without explaining that the monthly data plan must be ongoing, or the SIM card is deactivated.  A replacement SIM card from AT&T; is not renewable, like the one which comes in a new iPad from Apple.  The AT&T; store rep deactivated the SIM card within a few minutes after explaining that the data plan must be ongoing.  I only discovered the $36 charge when my bill arrived.  Luckily AT&T; removed it because I had not used any data.I rarely use cellular data because wi-if is so accessible.  However, for those who want to use occasionally use the cellular capability, you might want to do some more research.  I recommend spending time on the phone with, or visiting an Apple store, to find out your cellular data options.", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "Wolfie \"Da Wolfie\"", "ReviewID": "R26CMLAIIIGH5G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This iPad is a much more cost effective choice for those that want the quality of a Mac product but don't necessarily need all the new bells and whistles.

A good one, of course.PROS:Weight: By far, the most amazing thing about this tablet is that it weighs so little. I believe it weighs less than any other iPad out there, which is weird, but I think the iPad mini is supposed to cater to those who have a problem with that. The iPad isn't meant to be held in one hand, though. It's a real personal computer, only in tablet from, and you must treat it as such. If you need to be able to read in bed or something, get a kindle or iPad mini. However, you'll find that the iPad is very convenient for most uses.Design: The front of the iPad is defined by a single pane of multitouch glass - and a home button. The back is made of aluminum. There is a front camera, a rear camera in the top right corner, and a speaker at the bottom. This simplistic design, which Apple litigiously fought for against Samsung, is in a word, magical. I'm not too much into the marketing stuff, but seriously, there is something extremely premium about Apple products, and I am sure it is more than the pseudo philosophical marketing. The Smart Cover actually works really well, though its necessity is... debatable. Overall, this tablet feels like its worth 500 dollars. Ok, so it's 400 now, but you know what I mean.Durability: The primary user of this tablet is an unhygienic now-9-year-old who is not exactly dexterous and immediately gets on it after school, sin lavar sus manos. If you know glass, you know that the only thing that can really scratch it are minerals. That's right. Not knives or cleats, though they may if you try hard enough. It's finger salts, salt from food, dust, dirt, sand, jewelry like diamonds and quartz. However, today I wiped off all the prints with a damp hand towel and I could count, I kid you not, 3 micro scratches. That's amazing. This tablet has been dropped, probably not from extreme heights, but still. The glass at the corners, along with the aluminum housing, is tattered. There are several deep scratches in the aluminum on the back. However, there are no functional damages to this tablet. That's also very nice. You probably don't need the Smart Cover for its protective aspect. You will however, want it so you can use it for support. It helps a lot.Display: Eek. I'll kick it to you straight; the resolution of this screen is terrible. If your going to be looking at pictures, you're going to be disappointed. 1024x768 doesn't cut it. My 4.5 inch S2 had a resolution of 800x640. I thought it was sub par, but acceptable. The iPad is just bleh. It's colors are amazing though. I don't know too much about outdoor performance, but I've never felt that brightness was an issue, so it's probably ok. What the iPad lacks in detail more than makes up in size. Laying down in bed with a ten inch screen feels so empowering. I feel like I have all the media in the world in my hands, and I almost do.Apps: I don't use my iPad for work. It stays at home most of the time, and at home, I have my desktop. I would assume it would be pretty easy to use iWork to create, but I wouldn't know. *flame alert* I believe Android is better for smartphones, and iOS for tablets. There is a serious lack of tablet apps for android, but I am continually surprised at the growing iOS tablet app ecosystem. However, there are a greater variety of apps on Android, in my experience. The iPad can actually handle games pretty well, despite its age. That all I really need to say. There isn't any calculator or weather or stocks app, but you'll find great alternatives in the App Store.Camera: Why are you reading this? What are you doing with your life? Why would you want to use the iPad's camera for anything except FaceTime? Seriously? Well, that's all you're going to be able to do, because the cameras on the 2 are terrible. Really. I would expect more for 500 bucks, but whatever. It's not a priority. If you ever find yourself in so dire a situation that you need to use the iPad camera, you better invest in a disposable, or something.Battery life: Ho ho. Tee hee. The battery life of the 2 makes me want to giggle. Even 2 years later, the battery life still feels virtually infinite. I can almost guarantee you, you will never have a problem with the iPads battery life. This is because if the square cube principle. The surface area (screen size) increases at rate of the dimensions, squared. The volume, cubed. More volume means more battery. So, theoretically, the bigger the device, the longer the battery life. Oh, and iOS is super efficient, almost forgot that.Performance: Welp, iOS7 is here. Anybody with anything older than 2012 must upgrade to escape the lag! Not so. Though the animations in iOS7 are super slow and can induce \"motion sickness\", the iPad 2 handles it pretty well. (I swear, auto correct has something against the word we'll.) The gaming isn't bad for such an old device, though I have yet to try out newer games like asphalt 8. However, you'll be able to stream video (not in hd, of course!) and play 2d games  with no hitches. The keyboard does sometimes take a while to pop up and apps do take somewhat longer to load, but hey, we're talking about an old geezer tablet here.Features: I haven't been able to use Bluetooth to transfer files yet, presumably because Apple wants me to upgrade and use AirDrop. Classic Apple. And I'm pretty sure Siri could easily run on the 2. Oh well, looks like we're stuck with... The two doesn't have any gimmicks, per se, to it. It has the dual cameras, but that's about it. There is nothing to show off. Just to experience. FaceTime is great, though. Like, wow. It's really the best video chat technology I've ever seen. If nothing else, I would commend apple on its FaceTime infrastructure. It's simple and fun and convenient, not to mention powerful.Overall: Even after 2 years of not so nice treatment, my 2 is functionally perfect. It really feels amazing to be able to consume content on such a big screen. The thinness and lightness of the device make it disappear as you're using it. FaceTime really is the best interpersonal video chat platform as of today. IOS 7 runs fine on this, but don't expect to be so lucky next year. I was actually shocked to see the price here on Amazon. Really? 400 bucks for a 2011 tablet? When the 5 is just around the corner and will cost only 100 more? Only a fool would buy it now. However, the 2 really bolstered the image of Apple I had. I have a first gen Nano that actually still works for a whole day! I would expect the iPad to do the same. This review isn't recommending that you buy the 2. All I'm saying is that Apple makes the best tablets out there. Even the most hardcore Android fanatic (which I am dangerously close to) could agree on some levels. iPads are feat for consuming content. Maybe even for creating. However, if you want to get real work done, you're going to want to wait for the next generation of windows 8 pro tablets with Broadwell Chips in them. I need an IDE to be able to do programming when I go to college, and the fact that no such software is available for iOS means that I can't take this there. The iPad isn't a complete replacement for a real computer. But it comes pretty darn close.Sent from my iPad", "Date": "October 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great product/Great seller", "Author": "dabrown", "ReviewID": "R3245CIL86TL5J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was an excellent package; iPad, cove and external keyboard.

After ios 6&7 came out his ipad 1  was no longer able to keep up with the technology of the upgraded apps. I purchased the 64g ipad 2 so he would have plenty of room for his apps since some of the apps can be large downloads. i am able to also to limit what he is able to do in settings and the app store. He can only get apps ifi unlock it. ipad 2 was easy to child lock certain features and content. ipad 2's long battery is great on trips, it keeps him busy and i dont need active wifi for his apps to work.

Frankly, after the novelty wore off, it was sitting in the drawer more than on my lap.Well a month or so ago, on a whim I got the iPad 2. Within 24 hours of playing with it and discovering both powerful productivity (like aTimelogger and DayOne) and music apps (such as Synthesia, Garage Band) that fill voids in what I've seen as an owner of an Android phone, I became a devoted member of the iPad cult. From there, I tested several keyboards and have settled on the Kensington Ultimate and Logic Fabricskin.Now, after month downrange, it smile on my face hasn't worn off -- the iPad and I are inseparable.

It charges very quickly when turned off and plugged into the wall. The screen is very responsive, and the keyboard is not as difficult to use as I had feared (this is referring to the larger keyboard that appears when you turn the device side-ways. The smaller keyboard is more difficult, but not impossible). The only downside I see to the keyboard is that I can't select Spanish letters and accents.

I bought it to read articles (both academic PDF's and online fare via Instapaper) and play silly games, and it has exceeded my expectations on both counts.  I had used both a 7\" and 10\" Android tablet (modded Nook Color and gTablet, respectively) and a 4th generation iPod Touch in the past for pretty much the same purposes as with the iPad, and found myself not turning them on and subsequently selling them, so I was skeptical of how useful I'd find the iPad vs. a laptop or desktop.The advantage over the iPod Touch is just a matter of real estate.  The interfaces of the universal apps that I've used (ones that are available on both the iPod Touch and iPad) are much better on the iPad.  Not to knock Android, because I was admittedly using heavily modded versions of it and didn't have access to the entire Market (now Google Play, I guess), but there really are a ton of good apps available on the App Store.  There are good, efficient implementations of board games, silly puzzle games, a perfectly fine browser experience, good Dropbox, Instapaper, and Evernote apps; I could go on, but, really, there are just a ton of ways to use the iPad well.  I don't use it for much productivity (outside of Evernote and Dropbox), so I couldn't speak to that aspect.  But as a fun device that's useful to me, it's easy to recommend it to others.  If you want to spend the extra $100 for retina display, sure, go ahead and get the third generation one.  If you're struggling between the iPad 2 and other companies' tablets, though, I say go with the Apple.", "Date": "September 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Apple iPad", "Author": "Nancy N.

The packaging was great and there weren't any tears or major dents to the original box. The iPad was secure and protected.Cons: Some of the apps are not formatted for the larger screen of the iPad.

That was the right choice for me. I use it all over the place with free wi fi spots so widely available. There are so many apps available that you can customize it for your needs very easily. This almost replaces my laptop computer. I hardly ever turn on the laptop anymore. The iPad runs faster than my laptop on most things online. I bought my iPad after falling in love with the one that I was issued for use in my special education class. I have been totally amazed at the things that I have seen happening in my classroom with the iPad. Any teacher, homeschoolers, or parent should have at least one iPad strictly for the kids. They are great learning tools with so many educational apps available--most free or low cost. And if you have a special needs child or student, then you doubly need an iPad for their use. It is much easier to use than a conventional computer for special needs children. And if you have a child with any disability on the Autism spectrum than you absolutely, without a doubt MUST have an iPad for your child. There are hundreds of apps designed just for people with Autism. If for no other reason than to use as an augmented communication system device, you must get this for your child with Autism.If I am asked to name one flaw with the iPad, it is that it cannot be cleaned. The screen gets lots of finger prints and gunk on it--especially with children using it. And it will get scratches on the screen, no matter how careful you are. If using it in a classroom with lots of children it can be a germ breeding ground since you cannot wipe it down with disinfectant.

Nevertheless, the release of the New iPad brings forth a new question: Should you buy the now cheaper iPad 2?There are many factors to be considered when making this purchase. The main upgrades of the New iPad include retina display, faster processor, better cameras, and with iOS 6, siri. My family owns both the iPad 2 and the New iPad. Apple did not change the iPad much between these two generations. It kept the same battery life, the same thickness (almost), and the same design. Thus, it is a personal decision.The devices are very similar, and most of the cons of the iPad 2 are fixed in the New iPad. However, is the upgrade worth $100-150?Cons of iPad 2 and how the New iPad uses them:Lack of Retina Display: When the iPad 2 was released, retina display had already been seen in other apple devices, like the iPod touch 4th generation. The general public was disappointed by the lack of this feature in the iPad 2. The iPad 3 had this feature. However, I don't really notice the difference. They both appear to have excellent displays. The New iPad's improved display can only be identified in rare conditions, such as viewing upgraded apps or sharp photos. Overall, the retina display in the iPad increases the memory many apps in the app store take up. For example, many iPad 2 users posted bad reviews about Monopoly HD when they had an update that increased the memory that app took up extensively. The update of Monopoly HD did not bring any new features besides Retina display. iPad 2 users were angry because now they lost memory without any benefits.Lack of better Cameras: The iPad 2's cameras are terrible. They back facing camera is .7 megapixels. On a smaller screen this would be acceptable because it is still HD, but on a 10 in. screen photos shot by the iPad camera look pixelated. The New iPad is said to have 5 megapixel cameras. Even so, the cameras on the New iPad aren't that great. Look at the video I posted so you can see the difference yourself. The video is best viewed in full screen.Faster Processor: The iPad 2 has a decent processor and is capable of doing everything you can currently do on an iPad decently. The iPad 3 is faster, especially when loading apps. The upgrade is great but not necessary.Siri: With iOS 6, the New iPad will have exclusive new abilities like Siri. Although many are not appreciative of siri after seeing it on the iPhone, the fact that the New iPad will now have it suggests that apple will continue to do this. Apple's newest products will continue to receive features that older products won't have through updates. Thus, it may be a good idea to purchase the New iPad as another one is not expected soon.", "Date": "July 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "iPad is like no other tablet on the market!", "Author": "Granna", "ReviewID": "R1O8TKOWQEI5E1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Apple's reputation for quality is unsurpassed in thier tablet.

I tried out all 3 and a few more tablets before choosing the iPad 2. I bought the iPad because-1. Navigation was smooth with the iPad. With all other tablets, I noticed that the tablet would not react to the touch every once in a while.2. The tablet is for my wife. iOS is much more intuitive than Android when it comes to tablets. the complexity of use of Android is fine for techies, though.3. Assurance of OS upgrade. I know that my iPad 2 would be compatible with future versions of iOS and that Apple would allow free upgrades. At the time of my purchase, I wasn't so sure about Android based tablets (looking at how many Android based cellphones dont get timely OS upgrades)4. Flaws in other tablets. Every other tablet has flaws, which is pretty disappointing. Xoom is good, but they dont deliver what they promise (Read up on Xoom users' agony over the micro SD unusability for over 6 months). Sony tablet doesn't come with 3G.Reasons why I took so long before buying the iPad:1. Dependence on iTunes2. No SD input3. Heavy price of accessories (like the one for connecting iPad to a TV)But in the end, it was worth it.

My girlfriend just got me one for our anniversary. Funny thing is she just got one from her mom for Christmas at my suggestion. So now we both have one.She just recently got wifi at work, too. She takes hers to work. She tends to call me about 3-4 times a day (at least it feels like that) and now she can call me on her iPad using Facetime, so she can see me as well. I don't really know how I feel about that feature sometimes, but it's pretty cool. I have other friends with iPads and iPhones and stuff, so we can all Facetime just like a house phone. It takes a little more effort to use it (just like Skype), but it's a really cool native app to the iPad. The camera quality is a bit to be desired. I think my Mac has a better camera than the iPad.Anyway, I'm not giving a review of Facetime. The iPad 2 is fast. The screen is pretty large compared to my iPod touch and my Droid X. It works well as a reader. The games work well on it. I've even used it as a drawing tablet a few times. I would link a photo I've drawn in my review, but I'm not sure I can do that.The browser works just as well as it does on my Mac and my iPod touch. It's not the best thing in the world, but it works well.Mail is still a problem for me. I can't get my Yahoo to work and I can't actually divulge why. I know the reason why and I'm not willing to fix it because it could be a slight security risk. Gmail works fine for me. I can't get my work e-mail to work either, but I haven't messed with it enough to really determine the reason just yet.The iPads are great to have around to watch Netflix and things like that. Especially when there is a toddler that wants to watch something and everyone else is watching something on the big screen.Finally, the iPads are very expensive. So far my experience with Apple in the past few years is that they build a quality product and it tends to be worth it. I hope they continue this trend. I can't say whether or not it was worth the cost as I didn't shell out the money this time.

So hooked the IPAD up, and waited for a full 24 hours. AFTER that, configured the machine to the wireless internet and then commenced to download EVERYTHING. The IPAD is COOL. It goes EVERYWHERE and can do practically everything. And the really weird part about this whole thing is this....my daughter, who is 4, put a claim on MY IPAD?????? Uhhh...NO. The answer is GET YOUR OWN. Too funny; For real, we share. But she did put a claim on the IPAD.

I won my iPad 2 as a holiday party prize from my workplace. Also, I do not own an Android tablet (yet). To avoid being labeled as a Fandroid, I will list what I liked about the iPad first (yes, there are things that Apple does well):- the hardware design is indeed well thought out: thin, light, and nice to look at- construction and quality appear to be top notch- the screen display is sharp and bright- iOS for all of its shortcoming runs very smoothly on this device- tons of apps in the App store- insane battery life -> This thing has the best battery life of any backlit display device I've ever used. It probably can go 4-5 days between chargings with average web usage.- instant on -> best thing about a tablet in general: instant web browsing- the perfect device for consuming media (Web browsing, videos, games) in bedNow, on to what I didn't like:- I have to use iTunes -> First thing that the tablet signaled for me to do was plug it in to the computer and install iTunes- no back button- Safari sucks -> First thing I downloaded from the app store was Dolphin HD- no expandable storage (well known)- no Flash -> sure Adobe has decided to stop supporting this for mobile devices, but for the moment there are still plenty of sites which use it. I was surprised by how many sites to which I can't view content. For a device which purports to be great at Web browsing, this kinda sucks.- limited customization of iOS - it's a tray of icons and that's it. Barely can be called an OS.Although I hate that the iPad doesn't have expandable storage, USB ports, etc, that is the Apple way. It always has been. The Apple ecosystem is very closed and restrictive. I am positive the iPad 3 won't have any USB ports on it either. However, the main reasons why I'm only giving this device 4 stars are: iTunes, iOS and the lack of Flash. For the amount people pay for this thing, you should be able to access 100% of the sites out there. All this being said, and it pains me to say it, Apple still has no equal in producing a sexy piece of high quality hardware. Disregarding specs (i.e. processor speed, RAM) the iPad 2 is still the benchmark hardware for tablets. Just think if this thing had flash, a USB port and you didn't need iTunes to access it from your computer. Now that would be something.One additional comment on tablet devices in general. Nobody NEEDS one of these things. They are, in my opinion, the ultimate in media consumption (videos, e-books, games, browsing, social networking) which is the opposite of productivity. Seriously, the main reason I wanted one was so I didn't have to wait the 120 seconds it takes to boot up my laptop to browse the Web. And also so I could browse literally anywhere in my house.

Due to life taking it's own twist s & turns I was going to have to put off my purchase until next year. My boy friend bought me a poleroid e-reader 2 weeks ago to get me out of the living room after he went to sleep for the reading light as I'm addicted to everything Terry Prachet. Needless to say, while I was happy to be in our bedroom the e-reader is very limited in it's format & unless you know what your reading by heart your going to get lost thanks to missing text. Of course I am very thankful that he wanted to be generous & tried to be helpful but he knew I was unimpressed. So two days ago I was woken up to close my eyes & hold out my hands. He bought me the iPad2! The camera's are awesome, the size is twice as big yet the same weight as the e-reader. The already installed apps are great & navigating app store is so easy, let alone almost every site online that I have been to so far (20 of my favorite online news, shopping, weather etc.) already has a free app for the iPad2. There are a few interesting quirks though...1) You must have a pc to install the operating system through I tunes, but you can also go to an Apple store & they will help you.2) While it comes already installed with a YouTube app the videos aren't the best versions (due to their FLASH) but you do get the site, with most videos & songs.3) Apple IPad2 is not compatible with adobe FLASH... Not on the apps or if you just use the safari operating system to connect to the browser of your choice.4) No more zynga games, (Mafia Wars etc.) on Facebook if this will be your only mode of internet connection.5) The apps pages are in most cases very cool & graphically stimulating, however I am learning going to the same site using safari will have different content. In the case of Facebook, I couldn't view the links posted by my friends to my wall when using the Facebook app.6) The yahoo messenger app takes up the entire iPad screen & I tended to forget it was signed on to learn I was missing conversations due to web browsing... or sitting around waiting for a response.The iPad has made the last 2 days of after dinner family movies more tolerable, as the toddlers can watch their Disney movies. While I enjoy Netflix on the couch, they sung & danced to their hearts desires without me getting frustrated that I can't see Eric & Arial get thrown out of the boat for the 5 billionth time. Bed time has been fun for us all, as they are amazed I read them a color book (The little engine that could... Free in I-books) up in thier bedroom on my, \"tiny nooooooo touchy TV\".I LOVE MY IPAD2!!!! None of the aforementioned quirks are irritating enough to walk away, just things I don't know enough about or need to get used to. Considering the auto spell hasn't inspired me t9, I mean *59... ugh! Hasn't made me throw it out the window yet. But I can turn it off in the settings, which is a really cool feature with all kinds of settings & features I haven't fully jumped into yet.  You can buy the 500gb wifi external hard drive to store your movies & video's on, (as it's not expandable) plus share ability with up to 2 or 3 others, at the same time. So really it's only draw back is the whole Adobe Flash issue or I would think it is absolutely perfect!I knowI will go back to using my laptop from time to time, but right now I am so excited & inspired to find all the ways I can enjoy & use this clever machine it's going to be a while.", "Date": "October 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "IPad 2", "Author": "Cynthia Mcguffin", "ReviewID": "R257Y7YILAIZCF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been VERY pleased with my purchase!

Present iPad technology requires a stylus pen w/ an eraser tip for iPad to \"read\" the marks you make. Any way to make a different type of interface sensitivity (pressure  vs electrical charge of skin) to enable a finer tip as needed? Yes, one can choose tips and brushes, but requiring so much surface of the eraser tip to create a line seems inefficient.

When I tried to register it Apple said it was out of warranty.  Long story short, this iPad ended up being a replacement for another unit sold by he iPad Shop back in 2011.  They received a replacement from Apple and sold it to my wife as new in September 2013.  While it might have been new it was recorded by Apple as a replacement to the original owner and thus received the warranty only at the time of return -- which by 2013 had long since expired.  Further, the serial number on the box did not match the serial number on the iPad.  After a back and forth with Apple customer service I finally ascertained that this was a replacement iPad intended for someone else and sold as new by the iPad Shop.  Apple's serial number tracking confirmed this.  It might have been a new unit but Apple changes the serial number on units they replace and would not warranty it beyond the \"original purchase date\".  Bottom line:  Go directly to Apple for their equipment.  That said, I'm not real pleased with Apple for failing to warranty an obviously new unit just because they assigned a new serial number to a customer who never received it.  I returned the iPad and bought another directly from Apple -- I'm not sure why.  Basically, I'm not pleased with either Apple or the iPad Shop.  But I am pleased with Amazon who noted that there have been similar complaints from this vendor and quickly refunded the purchase price.

More importantly, I am also a techie, so it was inevitable that curiosity would eventually kill the cat (cat being the product loyalty).  When I decided that I wanted to see if iPads live up to the hype, I didn't want to go all out - I wasn't going to purchase a plan from a phone company that will overcharge me for limited data use - especially not when I can tether devices to my phone!  I also wasn't going to pay at least $100 more to get a retina display since I view it as unnecessary for me- certainly not worth the extra money (even if I do have an instinct to have the latest and greatest). I decided that the iPad2 16GB would be appropriate to base my decision!The iPad is a good looking piece of hardware - but I would say that the software left me feeling limited in what I was able to do.Pros:-It's pretty - I do love a good looking piece of technology, and in that, the iPad does not disappoint-I like the multitouch gesturesCons:-Heavy if you are reading in bed-Edges around the screen mean that I have to stretch my thumbs that much further if I am trying to hold and manipulate the device with both hands (you can always cradle it in one arm and manipulate with the other, but it just feels odd no matter how you do it)-No expandable memory - there are very few android tablets that do not offer this- get with the program apple-the App Store was not user friendly and was stubborn when connectivity wasn't fast-I find the settings app to be all over the place - settings for a single app may be in three different places (wouldn't it be nice to get into an individual app's settings from within that app)Overall, if you are looking for something simple to use and don't want to be able to do anything too indepth the iPad is a perfectly adequate choice.  iOS is very straight forward, and generally user friendly as long as you don't want to change settings for them (ie you want to use default settings)- otherwise, you may have to go on a hunt for the exact setting you are looking for (if it even exists).

The first one being the littlest Ipod from years ago.  I'm pretty impressed by it, along with my lil daughter, when she saw it being charged, she screamed \"Ipad!!!\"  lol.  The only thing that bummed me out was when it came with no battery life at all.  I had to charge it while getting the Ipad2 all set up, needless to say, it was stuck to the charger for couple of hours, while I downloaded free apps. I did notice it immediately registered Verizon, but I have AT&T; wireless internet at home and this was meant to be just Wifi only.  And not for long, it started asking if I want to add more data now or later before I can proceed with browsing.  That was an easy fix and I was able to modify it to just Wifi only. It then asked for IOS6 update while in the midst of downloading apps.  And after that, it was just smooth sailing and I made sure to enable some restrictions so my 4 yr old won't be buying any in-apps accidentally.  Read too much horror stories on that.  I did tell her to never click on the word \"buy\" because that would mean, it will take money away from Mommy!  LOL  Overall, quite happy with my big purchase.

There were no scratches or dents...nothing on it that I would be surprised of. Thank you for such a quick delivery. This will definitely give me time to familiarize myself prior to the start of my hiring season in the next couple of weeks!The iPad is in wonderful condition. I am so glad that I ordered the Verizon version. The data package deals are not too bad and can be purchased directly from the iPad. The apps are super fun and the apps that I will use for my kids are not that expensive, between 2 and 5 dollars. A note to self would be that IBM Lotus notes is not immediately compatible with Mac. The installation looks as if it happens, but the id name does not install. There are Youtube videos with instructions, but I am not the most computer savvy so I do not necessary understand the instructions.

(reiview may still need revising)", "Author": "moon fox", "ReviewID": "R3LM338BSH5SJN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "You are there, standing in the middle of the electronics department, credit card in hand, about to spend hundreds of dollars on a touch pad you can trust to be worth the money, and a good product. The store clerks are saying different things to you about each pad, and you don't know who to trust. Ladies and Gentlemen, the I Pad 2 is the correct item for you! It consists of app selection, optional WiFi, and other sources such as 4g. Coasting around the range of $800.00, I would suggest this particular system over any of the other available touch pads. I tried another once. I didn't like it. I would choose ipad2 over a regular i pad. why? many reasons..It is faster.it looks better based on the fact that it is so thin..Its the newest version, so why not take a go before it gets outdated?The following are my views on this remarkable contraption. Also, I'm just going to call the I pad 2 an i pad just to make it easier. Just know that the I pad and I pad 2 are 2 different products. Sometimes, i will call it an i pad 2, but just so no one gets confused while reading this, there's a fact. Hope they help!First facts: This was a bummer, but based on Apple restrictions, the i pad 2 does not have flash, so it can't play online games or run certain programs that need flash. There is also no place for discs or flash drives, so you can't download saved work such as the data on flash drives or discs. You can't download programs like Microsoft office programs on this particular item, which is not fortunate, not to mention the fact that it doesn't connect to the printer. Hopefully some day it will evolve into better stats.Camera: For the most part i like the camera, but based on the fact i haven't seen or interacted with many other i pads except my own, which has a crooked, bury camera, it wasn't the best for me, but the other touch pad i owned had a horrible camera. I don't know how the other cameras look on the i pad 2 because i don't bother to put pictures of myself out into the public on the store tester i pads, so, keep the camera idea something to check on before buying. On the camera though you can make it look straigt ahead like a regular video camera or make it face the way you are looking at the screen, so it flips around depending on what kind of picture you want. I give MY experience on the camera a B gradeApp selection: Great apps! Many apps are free, but 1 app's full version wasn't free on the i pad like it was on my other pad. I still don't think that should be a problem. Also the apps appear with fewer selections on the screen based on certain categories then my other touch pad, which appeared in a long list that was helpful. Although i would beleive that all together the ipad 2 has a wider selection of apps. Unlike some touch pads, The i pad 2 offers netflix, and many other apps that are one of the reasons i got the i pad in the first place. Great quality. I give the apps a A grade.Battery: The battery doesn't last very long. Sometimes, it last a long time, but for the most part, I always have it charging. This is a issue if i want to travel with it. I'm going to have to get a i pad car charger... Anyway, the battery issue may just be with only MY i pad 2 but I'm not really sure. I would give this category a C or B grade, but it has some work to do before it reaches an A.App download speed: The apps for the most part download quickly, but there has been some times where the apps don't make any progress with loading so i usually have to delete it (and pray it will actually download) and download it again. In the end i always get ti worked out but its like, \"Come ON!\" you know? I give this category a A for it's amazing speed!WiFi quality: I love this category. Mine plays most H.D. videos and can just download apps from its app store rather then having to connect it to the computer to download things. That i can really appreciate. I can open up nearly all web-sights just the way they would appear on the internet unlike my last touch pad. I would say in order to get the full i pad 2 experience WiFi is a must-have. I give WiFi a A for great function!Speakers: Lets put it this way, the speakers... they could use some work. Sometimes when i have it to the maximum sound it is hard to hear. That is not something that i favor based on the fact that the i pad is like, 40% sound, but i still like the product. If you have this problem i suggest going to a quieter area or plugging in ear phones to assure you get the most out of your money.Covers: I don't have a smart-cover. Perhaps the smart-covers do save the battery and make the screen sleep when you put the cover over it, but i have a cover that's not a smart-cover and it is just fine. As long as you turn it off when not in use for long periods of time any covers should work. Note that the cover should fit nicely around the i pad 2, that way, it is a better buy and protects the i pad more. i would suggest a case to help protect it and make a nice little stand for it. You can't exactly rate a cover because there are many different ones, but here is my rate on how important a cover is to have to me. A B. Its optional, but a good idea.App Usage speed: Most of the apps i use are great, fast, functional, and don't have jerky movements. Take Talking Friends apps for example. They are fun, functional, and fast. Just how it should be, not to mention very clever. There isn't much to say about this particular category, but let me just say it deserves a A or B for nice function.Note where there should have been another Category view: I haven't had really any interaction with a regular i pad, so i can't say if the i pad 2 is really \"new and improved\", but i can say its good for me and very fast. Keep that in mind.Video and Photo booth: I love making videos, so i was happy to hear that the i pad 2 came with a camera ready to make some videos! It is a personal highlight. Also photo booth is fun. seeing what your pictures look like in x-ray vision, and flipped, and so much more. I really liked that. too bad you can't film videos in photo booth :( Also note that both of these are the free apps that come right when you get the i pad. the video is connected to camera app.Personal Favorites: I love the i pad 2, but my favorite features about it, are the following:.Its very thin and simple, which is very neat..The apps are great and so are their function..A i pad without WiFi is a very sad i pad..Videos and photo booth..speed!-------> ZOOMGRAND CLOSING..These are all my opinions of different category in the i pad 2. Comment if there is more you want to know about the i pad 2 and i will see if i have an answer to add to this review for you. Thanks for reading!

He loves it. We still have been unable to update it to iOS 5 because our wifi kept disconnecting on wifi on laptop but I think when we do that it will be faster. First day he had some slowness but not everything is great. We looked at getting some of the tablets on the android market and went to best buy to review. I liked the idea because the androids are more customizable but had reservations because 1. They are about the same price as iPads 2. Wasn't sure if I wanted to take that risk. 3. I have iPhones and know how dependable they are. However I found the toshiba thrive and it was cheaper. So that was our main focus. Toshiba thrive vs. iPad 2. On one hand the toshiba had USB ports, sd card ports and customization options, on the other if was not familiar with it. So we tried them both at best buy. Toshiba thrive looked better. It's graphics looked more fun, apps are cheaper..mostly free and all that. But it was more complicated, which i love because I like to tween things. My husband on the other hand...does not. So he wanted iPad...I wanted toshiba thrive but we wanted to talk to somebody who knew more about it. So we grabbed a guy who only deals with tablets. He said he has an android phone and likes it but as far as tablets go he said hands down iPad won. Reason was that apple makes one specific hardware for iPads. So they had it perfected. All their apps and music were specifically made for apple hardware so it had very little problems. Android market on the other hand is made from many different tablets, that are all made by different hardware. Therefore, if an app is made on a toshiba thrive, it may work great, but if you download it for your samsung thrive, the hardware is different so you are going to have more freezes with all, crashes or lack of working at all.In conclusion, iPad 2 so far is more dependable and perfected. I do believe however, with time, the android market will be more perfected.

I am for the most part impressed.Packaging: Apple has always impressed when it comes to their packaging. The box is very sleek and makes you very happy with your purchaseSetup: Now since this is only the wifi version, it doesn't require much setup.Now after everything was setup, I had fun connecting downloading all the apps and seeing what neat things I could do with it. I have an iPhone so I was apply to move over all my photos, songs, files, etc to the iPad and it was very easy. The plan for this iPad is to use in meetings and allow the customers to flip through the pictures or files that I am showing.Downfalls: The issues I have been having with this is that since I only have an iPhone 3GS, the tethering (personal hotspot) can only be connect through bluetooth so the internet isn't as fast as through wifi. I also wish there was some sort of case that comes with the iPad. I had to spend an additional $50 for a case to protect it. The front cases that Apple make I find are not helpful at all in terms of protection so I wish Apple would offer a better of assortment of accessories rather than having to buy 'made for the ipad' products.Overall I am quite happy and am enjoying the iPad.

One problem that is apparent and has been stated multiple times is the weight of the device. It is too heavy to hold comfortably with one hand and the wrist may feel sore or achy after long periods of use. At the time of release, the screen was good enough for the average person to use. However, now with HD screens on devices less than half the size, the iPad's screen is seeming to pale in comparison. In addition, the battery life is quite exceptional. It lasts for weeks in Standby mode and also for long duration while reading or watching movies. Another point is that the cameras on the device are extremely poor, the resulting pictures looking too pixelated to view. You can forget about low-light shooting, because of a lack of flash and a poor image sensor.Software:iOS has always been a novel user interface, not for the unlimited functions, but for the extremely easy to use USER INTERFACE. Heck, I have seen kids not even 2 years old who know how to unlock and play their favorite games on the devices. The app store offers an abundance of games, and \"productivity\" apps. However, these productivity apps are not that easy to use. Lots of fonts supported by Microsoft Word do not work on these apps and the formatting is often completely messed up when transitioning from my laptop to the iPad. Apple needs to get Microsoft to build a preloaded app that will be accessible from other places in the OS.Overall:It's hard to recommend a product which is primarily limited to games, but if you're looking for an entertainment device, I would recommend the iPad 3 or 4 which have better graphics, a better processor, and a better screen.

Yet, the iOS doesn't do well here. In result, reading PDFs is impossible as it causes some serious strain on my eyes. I have 20\" LCD HP crap that has ~3 less pixel density. Yet, the font edges are as good as on this IPAD. Huh.I see IPAD3 fixes this problem, but not in the iOS but with better screen - good for marketing since not many people even see any difference. In fact, people say the screen is not worth it. Huh. Makes me think if I got the eagle eyes or maybe there is a few million people who simply don't know nothing.If you don't need PDF, well, letters in Safari are terrible too.Also, I cannot believe there is no LED behind the Home button. There is even that dark square in it where LED could fit (like on HP touchpad). So, carrying it next to me, like iPhone, and checking email frequently is the way to go? That's ridiculous. If I am not using it, it's on the stand, not withing my reach. That's where LED comes handy.Also, when I click on Mail icon that shows new email, it opens inbox, instead the email. - few clicks more are needed to see the email. Terrible approach if you plan to use multiple accounts and receive many emails.Finally, Notification bar is not popping-up new messages when I am working on ipad. Why? Status bar is there all the time - showing some small icon when new message arrives would be completely unobtrusive.In summary, message/email communication interface is years behind Android.

This review is my total honest opinion on the Apple iPad 2. I have no connection to Apple and this is my honest experience with the item. Advertisements and commercials for products are always circulating twenty four-seven. This also applied to the iPad 2. I had not paid much attention to the advertisements as I was satisfied with my iPad though at the moment, and had no need for the device.One day while at home, my iPad fell out of my hands and was destroyed. I thought maybe to buy a new iPad but then the idea off an iPad 2 came to mind. The iPad 2 was released on March of 2011. I had seen so many commercials and heard so much about it. So the next day I got my little piggy bank, emptied it out and had about $28. Yeah, there was not too much money in my little piggy.I got the rest of the money from my parents, and the next day went to the closest Best Buy and bought a 16GB iPad 2 black tablet for the price of $499.99.  I also bought the 1 year accidental protection plan for $99.99, knowing my clumsy hands and bad luck. So I had spent around $600.00 on a single item. So this Apple iPad 2 I had gotten was supposed to be near perfect on the amount of money I had spent on it and way better then my iPad. Now the Apple iPad 2 was 7.3 x 9.5 x 0.3 inches in dimensions. The iPad 2 was really thin and really comfortable to hold.It was also lighter then the iPad, not by too much but still a bit lighter. Now that I told you a little bit about the physical characteristics, let me tell you the new features that make this item unique. Apple doubled the RAM in iPad 2 from around 256MB to 512 MB. This will help process graphics for games and help deliver images faster. The two cameras is also a better feature over the old iPad, one in the front facing you and one in the back. Now these cameras aren't anything special. Their digital effect is just alright and the pictures will not come out too crisp or clear. The cameras do help with video chatting and FaceTime.One of the biggest disappointments I had with my iPad was that it was never available to multi task. The iPad 2 increased RAM allows more applications to be open at once. Now these applications are available in the app store. There are close to 70,000 iPad specific Apps that work on the iPad 2. There are also Google Books, iBook, Nook, Kindle for readers on the iPad 2. I can use all these apps all day long because of the battery life.The iPad 2 battery last over 10 hours constantly on. The need to recharge battery constantly is not necessary. Now as great as the iPad 2 is with all these qualities, every coin has two sides, this applies to iPad 2. There are several things still needing improvement on the iPad 2. There is no USB support for mass storage. There is also still no dedicated SD card slot. For example, if I wanted to put pictures onto the iPad from my camera, I would need an adapter.Another distinguishing flaw in the iPad 2 is the lack of flash support. There are many programs that require the iPad 2 to run on Adobe Flash. The Android tablet on the other hand does allow Flash support. The iPad 2 is a great and impressive tablet that can be purchased in the market today. The iPad 2 is probably the best on the market at the moment. The iPad 2 isn't perfect and the price may be a bit high but if you can afford it, I would recommend it for you.", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "I pad", "Author": "Willie L.

But think about WHY you want an iPad-2 or similar device, then compare the convenience and utlility of owning the devices, and Apple's iPad is very hard to beat.The big negative is the high price.  Another is no full hardware-level interface for UBS, SD, or Flash/Shockwave/Adobe support -- I can't figure out why not. You can hook several devices into the iPad-2, but in most cases (especially for cameras, SD cards, etc.) you'll need to have at least one physical media adapter.  Apple has maintained that Adobe Flash, Showckwave, et.al are obsolete, so they have no plans to support any of it.  Time will tell if Apple is correct (if not, then expect another adapter in a year or so).The positives outweigh the negatives however.The size and weight make the iPad-2 extremely easy to carry around, and convenient to use. For now, this IS a major advantage, but 'Moore's Law' about the rate of electronics miniaturization is still 'in effect', so the iPad-2's weight and dimension advantage will be gone within 2 years. By 2013, it's a good bet that all devices will be at elast as light and thin as the iPad-2, and they'll all do 'more stuff, faster' for about the same (or maybe less) money.The iPad-2's camera-system, with 'face-to-face' conferencing potential is more of a theoretical advantage than a real one: it only works well if you and the people with whom you're conferenceing have similar device capability (2 way video) and reliable broad-bandwidth availability. Otherwise, the experience and results are less than thrilling.The iPAD2 RAM memory is double that of the iPAD (512MB), which means faster performance of many graphic-intensive apps, and better responsiveness for users who like to 'multi-task' with several apps running at once.The Application software availaible fo the iPad-2 far exceeds that which is available for most competing devices, both in terms of quantity and quality. This is probably the main reason to get an iPad 2 -- you can just do more stuff (useful, recreationsl, fun, or other) with an iPAD-2, because more people have developed and marketed apps for the iPad/Apple platform than has been the case for anything else.  Given the overall state of flux for mobile computing, with platform and operating systems shifting, APPL (with a relatively stable operating platform and system) may be able to maintain its advantage in applications for some time.Worth killing people to own?  Don't mess with Apple: if you go into their stores, be sure you have enough money to get out alive.  In the mean time, April 2011 seems to be a good month in which to sell AAPL common stock.

I own Apple products (luckily I didn't have to buy them all my job did) and I've been sorely disappointed with every one. Apple products have not Flash support, no Java support, and no support for almost any video formats that are not Apple proprietary.If you want a mobile pad that plays almost any video I would suggest the Asus Eee pad both support flash, and both support Java, so that means online streaming sites work, and online flash games work. (two things Apple don't want you to be able to use so you have to get videos and games from them.)Now I can't speak for the Galaxy (though I've heard good things) but the Asus Eee pad is great for video. To watch video on the Asus Eee pad you plug in the pad, it comes up as a drive, you drag your video files to the Asus pad, and then you watch them without having to re-encode. This pad has played every video file I've tried.

My Ipad broke so I took it to an Apple store, but THEY WILL NOT FIX IT. Instead Apple will give you a refurbished Ipad if your warranty is still in effect. If your warranty has expired then your only option may be to throw your Ipad away. This means that after 13 months (unless you pay for an extra year of warranty then it will be 25 months) you could be flushing $500-$800 down the toilette. Even worse, if you are still under a warranty then Apple will give you a refurbished Ipad which could have 2-3 year old parts in it. An Applette at an Apple store told me that any broken Ipads are sent back to the factory where the unbroken parts are recycled into other Ipads. In other words, if you have a 6 month old Ipad that breaks, you could get a replacement that is already 2 years old. These disposal electronics only have a 3-5 year lifespan and `refurbished' has a reputation of lasting 1 month past the end of the warranty period or 6 months, whichever is a shorter period.

This aluminum body tablet is 9.7 inches weighing 1.3 pounds making it one of the lightest tablets on the market today, also having an A5 dual chip processor and a 720p retina screen display. It comes in three sizes, 16,32 and 64 depending on your downloading and previous photos, videos and music you can choose which one will better suit you. This tablet is a must buy if you're a traveler or you want a cool gadget to play games, listen to music, take photos and view all your social networks. Not to mention its great battery life when your on the go except for when your watching movies. The layout on the device is very structured so if you're a user that has an android phone then you probably wont like the feel that the iPad gives out. If you're an apple fanatic like myself who has all apple products then this will be another great add on to the collection.  Working at BestBuy you have the exciting job to know all the truth behind products as well as being able to get them a little early, nevertheless I must say that this was worth the buy. For the average man it will cost you 500 dollars, 543.11 to be exact when you pay NYS tax but like I said it's worth the buy. Launching the iPad was a great idea, with this device you can take notes and organize your daily tasks and if you just want a device to use to play thousands of games (many which are free) then this is a great buy. Personally carrying a MacBook pro to school each and everyday puts a toll on your back, so the iPad is a easier way to have a device which can do most of the things your computer can do, it is called an accessory to a MacBook  Personally this has to be one of greatest products out there I remember when I first bought it and synced it using iCloud to my other apple devices. Apple has always had a classy start up screen, so all you see in BOLD letters is \"Welcome\" following \"IPAD 2\" in an artistic but simple manner. I take it with me to school every time so I can take my notes and search the web, not to mention going on twitter or Facebook while class isn't in session. Its your everyday \"Big cellphone\" you cant help but take pictures on it, or add music it to and buy dozens of cases as if it were on of your new cellphones. The only thing that might bother a user is that it doesn't support Adobe Flash player. Many people can't stand that because they love to watch movies and video clips and the iPad doesn't support it, that is the biggest upset with the iPad. With the iPad you have the option of accessing the Internet via Wi-Fi or threw a hotspot, which is convenient for the user making it easy to tap into the World Wide Web. Overall if this device is in your budget you should get one, preferably a black one, the white one gets pretty dirty (I have one). If you are buying the iPad make sure you also include a protection plan because if you accidently drop it (since your going to be having a world of fun) the screen will crack, it is made up of glass.

Last year, I dropped cable and considered either buying a Mac Mini or iPad 2 w/ Apple TV 2 and hooking it up to my TV. I decided to go with the latter. Not the best move. If you want to buy content from Apple, it may work well for you. If not, you have to jump through hoops or put up with inferior quality. Netflix and Hulu are not as good on the iPad or Apple TV as they are on a computer.In fact, I should have stayed away from the Apple line in my HTPC decision... It would have been smarter to get a nice, Sony laptop and one of the WiDi boxes that allow you to screen share your PC with your TV. (I hate the idea of plugging a computer into HDMI with a cable). Then, when you play music from your laptop to your TV (connected to a stereo), you can trip out on the visualizer. Apple TV 2 has no visualizer. It has no horsepower. It is the iPhone 4 processor packed into a hockey puck with some output jacks slapped on. (from a design perspective, it is well done. I do think Apple are still great with hardware).Tablets are toys. For example, if you want to surf the web on the iPad, there is no Flash. Indeed, people make a much bigger deal about this than it is, as most big websites offer the same content as h.264 video. However, you will run into a few that only use Flash. You can use Photon, but it is not that great. It is true that Flash on mobile devices, even Android, is not very good. See? Tablets are toys!The really bad thing is that Safari does not support the file upload html input element, so you cannot upload photos to sites like Ebay or Facebook. You need to use their apps. Why? Because iOS does not let you get into the directory structure. It is a toy. A consumer product. It is not cheap either.Like I said, I should have just got a nice Windows 7 laptop and WiDi, which would have been better than a Mac Mini and a remote keyboard. The laptop can go anywhere and can be used without the TV. Why not get a Macbook and Apple TV 2 and use AirPlay? Because it does not support screen mirroring! I think there are third party solutions, like AirPlay Server (not made by Apple). But we know why they do this. If it doesn't fit into the Apple ecosystem, they don't want to put in much effort to support it. After all, if they did that, you might watch Hulu instead of paying for shows on iTunes. I shudder to think that Apple is rumored to be interested in aquiring Netflix and Hulu. If they do, say goodbye to affordable programming...Oh, and if you want to buy a show or movie on Amazon and watch it on your TV with the Apple ecosystem, good luck. It is nit really possible with the iPad 2 or Apple TV 2, and if you do it on the Mac, you either need to plug into your TV, or maybe try the third party AirPlay screen sharing software, if it still exists or is any good...The Intel WiDi system, with devices made by a few manufacturers, had 1080p for years before the new Apple TV 2 did. If you project Hulu or Netflix, full screen, onto your TV, it is 16:9 widescreen, etc. It is simlly a better HTPC setup than I can think of! Total buyers remorse. I will have to put up with this iCrap for a few years, until it is totally obsolete...My Apple fanboy days are over. Everything I own is Apple, and I see more and more bugs and more creepy \"lock you in\" behavior every day. Look, I am not going to pay $4 to rent a movie or $1-4 to buy TV episodes. Even though I watch maybe an hour or so of video programming a day, I would end up spending $100+. I may as well have cable.With the new Apple iBooks scandal, we can all see the writing on the wall. I also see Apple products, even the Mac, becoming less computers and more consumer toys. I bought my first Mac because I am a developer and needed a POSIX environment. Many times I wish I just got a decent Windows laptop and dual booted Ubuntu and Windows 7.Apple quality has gone downhill bigtime recently. The new updates to Apple TV have it crashing quite often.To make a long story short, if you want to buy content from Apple, an iPad may be fine. But if you want Netflix, Hulu and Amazon, you should look elsewhere. What? The iPad has Netflix and Hulu and Apple TV has Netflix built in? Yes. But they are not as good as the computer versions. To watch Hulu on your TV, you have to do a convoluted process, to get it to work somewhat well:1. Close all the apps on your iPad2. Shut down your iPad3. Restart Apple TV4. Start your iPad5. Turn on screen sharing6. Start HuluThe closing apps and restarting the iPad was recommended to me by Hulu support, but restarting the Apple TV 2 seems to help a lot too. See? This is worse than Windows! Remember when Apple products didn't need to be rebooted comstantly to work?That will get you Hulu on your TV, but it is  4:3 with content cut off. The video is jerky and (appearantly due to legal reasons) they can only have a 15 second buffer size, unlike the Flash based version.I will say that the iPad 2 with Apple TV 2 can do some amazing things. A game like Metalstorm, played via AirPlay mirroring has a cool feature, where the iPad becomes a virtual cockpit (it is the game controller) and the game is on the screen. Indeed, an iPad with its gyroscope and acclerometer is a great gaming controller and gaming device.That said, if you like stuff like World of Warcraft, you are better off with a Windows laptop. iOS is a great gaming platform, but I think Windows still has an edge for deeper games.I am not a gamer. This was meant to replace cable TV, and does not do the best job. I was warned. I read a review in some tech mag that said the same thing... But I figured between Netflix, Hulu and the AirPlay feature, I had all my bases covered. Yes, but it is not a quality experience. It is often tears before bedtime.If you want a consumer gadget toy kind of thing, the iPad is fine. Probably better than any other tablet out there. But I now think tablets are a fad. The press claims they are the future. People tend to settle for less, if told it is hot stuff. Look at Twitter, or the fact that most of us listen to music that has lesser audio quality than a CD (which doesn't sound as good as vinyl!). Heck, I settled for 720p for this setup. I could have spent the same amount of money, got a quality laptop (like a Sony, forgetabout Dell and HP), and a WiDi box, and had a way better experience... Along with having a real computer that I could use independent of my TV -- something with a real web browser, real applications... I gotta say, even Safari on a Mac is pretty bad. The app looks nice, but web pages are often poorly formatted and there is a bug that prevents me from using my bank's website!See what I mean? Apple used to be the one that had quality. I think they have become arrogant and are resting on their laurels. Additionally, the influx of lame consumers combined with \"democratic design\" has them spending more time on Twitter integration than develping a decent mobile browser that can do something as basic as upload a file! Forget about Flash! These things can't even upload files! How can they? You have NO ACCESS to the file system. Even then, they could let you access the photo roll, but they were too busy setting up iCloud so they could gouge you, and putting in system wide Twitter integration for the iSheep idiots.I used to get annoyed when the Phandroids and Apple haters called these iToys and the users iSheep. But there is a lot of truth to that.I bought my iPad 2 about 10 months ago, and I have buyer's remorse. I had way too much faith in Apple. Keep in mind, they want you to buy their content. They are not going to bend over backwards to create a decent Hulu or Netflix experience. Who knows? Maybe these are purposefully hobbled so you will get fed up and just buy the show from iTunes.But iTunes is not great. I have a decent internet connection, and it takes 2 hours to download a 1 hour show. They do not stream. In my opinion, Apple is a terrible internet company. For example, you can't even watch the video, on Apple's website, about the new iPad on the iPad 2. I have tried to backup my iPad 2 for a month now, but their iCloud stuff is so dead slow, it fails after a few hours, and the progress bar says it will take 10 hours to back up -- just the basic backup!DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE! The iPad is the best tablet, but tablets are HYPED! You would be so much better off just getting a nice, small, quality laptop. Given the better integration of Windows 7 and WiDi for getting your stuff on the HDTV, I would even say, forget about getting a MacBook and Apple TV 2. Forget about a Mac Mini and a cumbersome remote keyboard. I have the worst Apple hangover right now! It just hit me how limited a lot of their stuff is... Their nice ecosystem can be done better, and with more options and choices. I'd rather play music from a Windows 7 laptop to my TV/stereo through a WiDi box, and get the visualizer and all that jazz...I used to really love Apple products, but they have lost their luster. I don't think products like the iPad 2, the new iPad, and Apple TV2 meet the needs of even most consumers. The fact that the Mac is slowly becoming a big iPad makes me wish I had opted for a Windows/Ubuntu system.Did I mention that after the iOS 5.1 release and the new Apple TV 2 update, AirPlay has crashed on me about 8 times. It probably would have crashed more, but I often just listen to the radio instead now. Pathetic, eh? Yep, Windows ain't lookin' so bad now!Apple is becoming way too oriented to the average consumer. If you cut the cord (ditch cable) and go with Apple, you will pay as much, if not more for content, especially if you have a family. Don't buy an iPad 2 and an Apple TV 2 and expect Netflix and Hulu to work very well. This is no slam on either of those companies -- I think they rock! The best Netflix snd Hulu experiences are computer based (I have not tried Roku, Boxee, etc.)You should not have to pay $4-5 to rent a movie, or $2-3 to buy a TV show. WTF? I don't want to watch that same episode of The Office more than once.Just like this iBooks scandal, it is clear that Apple is here to suck you dry.

Further, the OS led me to expect to be able to enlarge views, but that only works sometimes. Finally, the touch screen's copy, select, and paste functions are incredibly  frustrating. If you are clicking on small text and want to cut and paste, it's sometimes impossible to select the correct spot, and I've wasted a total of hours trying to do this basic function. An alternative would be arrow keys in the software (on-screen) keyboard, but there are none!

Our household just got an iPad against my better judgement.  Seems one of us drank the Koolaide.

So if all your friends and family are using iPhones and iPads you will have no problem communicating with them ( well not really) .  Apple has a chip on their shoulder about not invented here.  They have proprietary apps and programs that only work and play well with same ( AirPrint, FaceTime, etc) .  Brother for instance makes one of the most popular and economical mono laser printers in he world and AirPrint does not work with it.  You have to buy an app to be able to print from iPad to Brother products. Fail.

All reviews agree on the following: 1) the ipad is still the best tablet around and 2) it is the easiest to use. Well, both statements are wrong. Since so much has been said already on the ipad let me get straight to the issues:- Being an android user (phone-wise) I got so used to the back button. On the ipad there is no such thing. If you push home, you get straight to home screen. If you want to go back one stap within an app, touch the screen and search and search for \"back\" on the screen. It is very inefficient. Also when installing multiple apps from the market you have to go back and forth several times.- The screen resolution is too low. Webpages do not look as good as on other tablets. While 4:3 format makes some sense, given that you use it also in portrait, the low resolution looks just outdated. Ok, I knew that before, but I did not expect it to be as disturbing.- Google. Apple fights its war with google to the disadvantage of consumers. No Picasa integration! Seriously, this is just poitics! They want to take control over you, so you are not supposed to use google sevices. You will also miss other google apps if you know android.- No official google talk! Say goodbye to you android using friends.- Amazon. They had to circumvent Apples policy using a web app for their services. Just because they want to force you into itunes. Once you are in itunes, you are forced into buying apple products forever. Why give up the freedom of choice? Lets say apple products were getting worse and in 5 years all your money is in itunes items. Do you want that? Hell, no. If you buy music with Amazon you remain independent of the hardware provider at least. The ipad is a mere retail channel (like the kindle fire, only more expensive). It does not give you freedom like galaxy tab.- USB. No real port. Ok, buy the adapter. 30 bucks. Find out it serves only 20mah. So it is not USB, as it is not following the standard which 100. It is disfunctional! You need workarounds.- The whole device is about workarounds. Apps. Paid apps! Apple earns on programms that give you DLNA, THE STANDARD to stream movies to your tv. Or they earn on making you buy the apple tv box. But Apple just ignores and established standard.- Antitrust, where are you? Microsoft would have been sued to death for what apple is doing here!!!- File access. Forget it. This is again about workarounds. Dropbox etc. Well, but I wanted this for my parents. Supposed to be easy, but IT IS NOT. It is f difficult to find all the f workarounds. To start actually working with this.Conclusion. Decent pad to surf with nonflash browser. Bound to apple channels for buying digital stuff, basically a retail access you are paying for. Imagine paying your supermarket just for being there. Everything else is disfunctional, not following standards, locking you in, making you search for workarounds and thereby stealing your time.

To say the least i was completely underwhelmed.The cameras may as well not even be there! The quality is aweful on both the front and the back. Apple made up for this by putting facetime software that is extremely sluggish on the I2! The main reason i got the I2 was to communicate with my wife and kids on facetime on her iPhone...The new design (although impossibly thin and light) is very difficult to hold. The edges are kinda pointed  and its thinness leaves me feeling like it's going to slip out of my hands. The original I pad was one of the most ergonomically friendly devices ever made.The performance (processor) isn't even noticeably different than the original. Don't try to comment and tell me \"well, the clock speed is actually blah, blah, blah...\" garbag! When I put it next to my wife's original and we load up the same apps and webpages its hardly different and in most cases no different. My wife laughed hard at me when i waiting ALL day for this dissapointing \"upgraded tablet\" and laughed even harder when hers performs just the same!It's frustrating when you realize your favorite company hyped an inferior product this way.

I had such high hopes for this little device. Then was astonished at how it didn't even come close to my medium-low expectations.Here it goes:  The auto rotate is slow and suddenly will rotate when tilted randomly. When you don't have the wall plug-in it will not recharge while plugged into a laptop. The touch pad is either so sensitive or will NOT work At ALL after many attempts. Apple says it has a 10hr battery life - try five hours at best. A data package must be bought to use the Wi-Fi when the advertisement says it can be used right out of the package. You have to buy iTunes comparable packages to use the iPad. Free Apps are NOT all free - there is usually a fee to make them work to the point they are enjoyable. Don't even try to upload ANY of your own music or movies. Apple is sooo proprietary that if you didn't buy the music or movies through iTunes you can't use it on the iPad. And when you try to access the Internet, better-off using your Mac/PC. Moreover, accessing Wikipedia or nearly any other sites that uses videos to enhance the info, entertainment, music you can only watch around 70% of the content. Sure, the Flash is not available for iPad but it should be able to play the other videos. On Aug 5th, I called Mac customer service and the rep even said he could not believe Apple sent out the iPad 2 without some kind of plug-in or app to make the iPad more user friendly with the Internet. Oh, one more, DO NOT set the iPad face down or it will slip off nearly any surface you think is flat. The front surface is so slippery.I don't have the time to list and all negative experiences have been experienced only owning it for three months. However, I must say, the screen is bright and clear. The iPad is light and sturdy. The apps that do work, work VERY well. The processor is extremely FAST! It is not a horrible product. It just needs to mature a little.I have been using Apple/Mac and PC products for more than three decades and could not speak higher of the quality and ease of use of Apple/Mac until now. I'll probably be buying a different brand like a HP Slate 500, LG G-Slate, Viewsonic ViewPad 7, RIM BlackBerry PlayBook - to name a few next time unless I pad 4 is more compatible with reality. Please, for the love of all good things, heed my advice and DO NOT BUY THIS! (At least not yet.) Nearly ANY other pad/tablet at two thirds the price will do much more than the iPad 2.* NOTE * DO NOT BUY THE iPad magnetic Smart Cover. It easily slips off and WILL traumatically send your iPad to an early demise.No, I would not recommend this to a family member or friend at this time.
