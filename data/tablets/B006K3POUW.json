{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Almost Completely Unusable", "Author": "William H. Peavy", "ReviewID": "R16ZJYUM5LA9CB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This device comes with Android 1.6.It comes with a proprietary Panimage app store that is impossible to use - no results were returned with the \"Search\" feature, but it could find apps under a \"Random\" tab. When I tried to download an app from the \"Random\" list, I would get a network error. This is despite the fact that I was connected to a nearby wireless router with 20mb/sec download speeds (and I've connected many other devices to this network, and they've all worked great).So I opened up the browser and went to market.android.com to see if I could download some apps. But, it takes approximately 3 to 5 minutes to load each webpage, and the browser would freeze up before I could ever download any apps.Next, I tried out the camera. It's pretty low quality by 2011 standards, but it was good for a laugh. I took a picture of myself and it automagically placed my picture inside a cheesy graphical frame with the text \"Love\" around the outside image. There was a button next to this modified image that says \"Share\" - I pressed this, but got an error message, something to the effect of \"no apps that you allow you to share are installed\".If you're looking for a tablet that allows you to install apps, take decent pictures, or browse the web - I recommend looking somewhere else.", "Date": "December 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "stop!", "Author": "R Rosen \"Piedmont Yoga Studio\"", "ReviewID": "R3OGJRJKP0HD3Q", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "dont touch that add to cart. bought this as a back-up to my iPad, and i understand it's not expected to be the same. but honestly, it's just as the other reviewer says, useless, glacially slow, difficult to impossible to maneuver, in a word, useless. zero stars if possible.", "Date": "December 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Worst purchase ever", "Author": "kentucky mom", "ReviewID": "R2DG1JLYXS0TVN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had purchased this thru ebay but was looking for reviews elsewere. I had bought this for my teen daugther and we tried to set it up for her. It wouldnt not allow use to set up her email facebook or even her android market account. wifi was another issue, we would try to set up wifi and the response we had was no network working. Internet was slow if we were eve able to get connected. My brother that is a computer maintenece technician said that this is nothing but a waste os parts and plastic. The software and hardware wasnt compatible with programs needed to run this tablet and that even though I wasn't allowed a refund my best option was to recycle it.", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "I agree....GARBAGE", "Author": "Donna Burch", "ReviewID": "R2THH0SQ06ZJWP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Received this from mother in law and do not have the heart to tell her it is pure GARBAGE!

Every time I try to even turn it on, it would just turn off automatically without warning. Another thing I hate about this item is that it can't play YouTube(or maybe you have to download a flash player but maybe). But yeah, I will have say that this item is not worth it. Android really disappointed me this time.

The only thing it does is browse the internet. Cannot even transfer movies to it. Personally, I like Apple products and would only get an iPad.

I purchased  this tablet from QVC I believe they knew it was crap when they sold it. Now the company has went out of business, there should be a way we could get out money back.
