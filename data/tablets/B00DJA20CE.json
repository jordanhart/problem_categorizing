I basically only use it for song lyrics.  I downloaded the setlist app so that I don't have to use my notebook on stage (very unprofessional). The words to all my tunes are highlighted and it's so much better than turning pages in a notebook which would always end up falling out of the rings.  I am happy so far, but I really need to learn this ipad better.  Great battery life also.", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00DJA20CE"}}
