Oddly enough, it's so beautifully easy to use (my one year old daughter loves playing with it), it's almost doesn't feel like a computer at all.A word of warning - this review is written for people who've never owned an iPad before - and are wondering what all the fuss is about.  If you're thinking of upgrading skip down to the \"What's great about the Air\" section below, or just buy it - it's amazing.Just what's all the fuss about?--------------------------------------I used to own a laptop for work, and (very occasionally), it'd sit on my lap on the sofa, and I'd use it for pleasure (eMail, watching films or playing the odd game).  Then I bought my first iPad, and the laptop became redundant, a boring \"work device\".  Hard to explain, but the fact the iPad is so small and light, and you navigate around with your finger by pointing and gently swiping the screen makes the whole experience a lot easier - a lot more fun.Even my most \"Luddite\" of friends have been won over.It's incredibly simple and easy to use (it only has one main button), and everyone from my one year old daughter to my 85 year old dad have taken to without problems.  It's size and shape also support using it like a book (literally to read a book or web page), but you can also watch TV and films.Personally I'm also paranoid about my password getting \"hacked\", and someone running up a huge Amazon bill or buying stuff with my credit card on eBay.  Well one of the benefits of the iPad (and iPhone) is it's \"almost impossible\" to get a virus - one of the most common ways to get hacked.  This doesn't mean you shouldn't use strong passwords, (both Sony and Adobe got hacked), but it's reassuring to leave the Windows world behind.Finally, I love the way these devices (iPad, iPhone, Apple TV, Apple Mac), increasingly work together.  The fact you can start a Pages document on your Mac and edit it on your iPad, or take photos on the iPhone, and in seconds see them on the iPad or Mac and display them on the Apple TV.The thing is, \"it just works\".What would you use if for?----------------------------------* Shopping online.  Obviously - you could be reading a review on Amazon about the iPad Air!* Reading News stories.  As you can hold it like a book it's great to read the news online (my wife loves the UK Daily Mail newspaper Online - personally I prefer a web digest from free app Zite).* Reading Books.  It's great for reading books from Amazon Kindle or Apple Books with the benefit of 1,000s of online book reviews* Navigating web pages.  Instead of clicking with a mouse, you gently swipe your fingers on screen to scroll around* Watching Films.  I use it to watch Netflix online videos (with an Apple TV you can send stuff to the telly)* Reading and replying to mail.  I use \"mailbox\" a great free app to read and reply to mails, but there's a free one included* Showing and organising photos.  Any photos on an iPhone are automatically available within minutes in \"the cloud\"* Playing games.  From fun puzzle games like \"Cut the Rope\" to fully fledged first person shooters.* Listening to the Radio.  With \"Tune in Radio\" you can listen to thousands of radio stations world-wide.  My personal favourite is London UK based XFM - alternative rock* Listening to music.  I stream mine to an Apple TV, but you can also buy portable speakers or just plug into the AUX socket* The list goes on and on.Which model should I buy?----------------------------------I can't comment about Android tablets (apart from the Google Nexus which is well regarded), but in terms of the Apple tablet line-up in order of cost:-1. Avoid the Apple iPad 2, it's a relatively old model, under-powered and with a lower resolution screen.  If you really want an Apple but don't want to spend the cash, buy a 16g WIFI 3rd or 4th generation iPad from eBay.  Avoid this one.2. iPad mini is a lovely tablet.  A 7.9 inch screen and astonishingly light and remarkably thin - it feels like a light-weight book.3. iPad mini with retina screen. Again 7.9 inch screen, but with the blazingly fast A7 chip and a \"retina\" (high definition) screen.  Worth the upgrade if you can afford it.4. iPad Air.  Much larger screen size (9.7 inches - doesn't sound much but it makes a huge difference).  Same fast (A7) chip as the Mini with Retina - the latest and fastest iPad available.Clearly (from my viewpoint) there's only really three options.  The iPad Mini, the Mini with retina screen and Air.What are the Optional add-ons?-----------------------------------------Well, assuming you've dropped by the Apple Store (which I would highly recommend - fantastic service), and handled the iPad Mini (with/without retina screen), and iPad Air then your options are around memory size and cellular option.Memory:  Once bought, you can't add memory (space for apps, films, books etc).  However, the basic price goes up a huge amount (+$100 for the 16g to 32g iPad Air).  But, having owned a 16g and then a 32g iPad - I can safely recommend the 16g unless you really want to store a huge amount of videos and downloads.  Only you can decide, and if you're lucky enough that money is no object then splash out.  Otherwise, 16g should be fine for most people.Celular:  Allows you to connect to the internet while you're out and about.  This will add an additional +$100 to the price and means you can slip in a mobile phone SIM card.  This means (for an additional $5-10 a month extra), you can access the internet on the move.  Alternatively, you can opt for the WIFI option, and use it at home or at at \"hot spot\" (eg. Starbucks, most rail stations and hotels etc).Personally I'd buy (and indeed did), the 16Gb iPad Air WIFI.Do I need anything else?-------------------------------Most people (me included) buy a cover.  Apple (and now several copy-cats) make a \"smart-cover\" which automatically shuts down the iPad when you close it, and switches it on when you open it.  There's versions which cover the back, or just the screen.  Apple charge from $35 to $65 for their (admittedly) high quality fabric or leather covers, but there's many available from $10.  Be aware, you do get what you pay for.Personally,I think it's a pity to cover the beautiful aluminium industrial design of the iPad with a cover - but if you've spent hundreds of pounds you'll want to protect it from scrapes and bangs.I also invested in a keyboard ($20-$70), as I tend to write a lot of mails and documents (remember it comes with a word processor).  I'd recommend the ogitech Ultra Thin iPad Air Case with Keyboard - Space Grey and the ZAGG Keys iPad Air Case Folio with Backlit Keyboard although these are strictly optional unless you want to use your iPad as a proper laptop.Finally, if you have another Apple device (eg. an iPhone, Apple TV or Mac) you'll find these work together beautifully.  For example, you can create a reminder on your iPad and it appears on your iPhone.  Equally, photos taken on your iPhone appear on your iPad, and you can stream music or videos from iPad, iPhone or Mac to an Apple TV.Some people think this \"locks you in\" - but it's your choice.How should I set it up?--------------------------Well, if you already own an iPad or iPhone it's incredibly easy.  Just log in with your existing iTunes and iCloud accounts, and select the option to either set this up as a new iPad or restore from backup.If you've never owned an iPad before - read on to hear about how to set up an iTunes and iCloud account - it certainly confused me the first time I used them.+ iTunes account - is how you buy your music, Apps or films from Apple.  You register your credit card with them, and protect the account with a secure password+ iCloud account - is used to identify you as an individual.  This gives you 5Gb of backup space (your iPad will be automatically backed up when you charge it), and also means your iPad will work together with your iPhone.How to set them  up:1) Create a SINGLE iTunes account for your immediate family and children.  Then when you buy an App, it's immediately available (for free) to all the family members.  Maybe once the children reach 15-16 they'll want their own account (as otherwise they'll end up spending your hard earned cash on your credit card to buy music you don't want).  Until then - it's a great way to share the Apps.2)  Create YOUR OWN INDIVIDUAL iCloud account for person.  That means if you buy an iPhone you can share data (eg. reminders, notes or calendar events) across both devices.  If you're partner (and maybe even children) have their own iCloud account they also have 5Gb of space, and can keep their own notes and documents private.Easy when you know how.What's great about the Air?-----------------------------------* Lighter (30%) and thinner than the previous version (469g from 650g)* Even faster A7 chip.  Blazingly fast!* Improved sound (compared to the iPad 4)* Software including  + iMovie - edit and publish home made movies  + Numbers - Fully functional Excel for the iPad  + Pages - Word processor  + GarageBand - Play a piano or a drum kit  + iPhoto - Edit and organise your photosWhat's not so great?--------------------------* The change in physical size means you'll need a new keyboard or replacement cover if you're upgrading* Pity Apple didn't include the \"touch ID\" to secure your passwordsOverall Opinion---------------------It's hard to believe the iPad version 1 was released just four years ago, and there's a huge raft of \"me too\" tablet computers to choose from, but the Apple iPad Air is still the one to beat.As the UK based consumer magazine \"Which?\" magazine put it - \"...the best tablet we've ever tested.  Apple packs a beautiful screen and lightning fast processor into a slimmer-than-ever shell, and battery life is very impressive\".Yes, there are cheaper Android based alternatives, but the quality, design and beauty of this tablet just sets it apart.  If it were a car it'd be a top of the range Mercedes or a BMW.Highly Recommended.", "Date": "January 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "Daniel G. Lebryk", "ReviewID": "R2RCYFJ9NNSROC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The iPad Air is everything I imagined it would be and a lot more. This latest generation iPad is so much lighter than previous versions; it is now approaching the weight of a Kindle - meaning it is easy to hold for a long time. The body is about two inches narrower, making it easier to hold. The retina display is so darn sharp and looks great.The iPad Air finally pushed me to upgrade my original, version 1 of the iPad. I bought that iPad on release day, seemingly millions of years ago. I loved that device, my one complaint was that the iPad was too heavy - everything else about it was great. Now that I've used the Air, I'll never go back. This was an upgrade well worth doing.November 2, 2013 Update: After using this for two days and thinking harder about the iPad, I figured you might want a few reasons why this might not be for you. Your iPad works just great and you don't do much more than read email, play angry birds, and look at websites all at home. In my case I went from a slow turtle first generation iPad to this lightning fast new version - I'm blown away. And if you have a latest previous version and get a great deal on recycling your current model (read at least $200) then it might make a lot of sense. This is an expensive device, and a MacBook Air is not all that far away from the iPad, after you add $60 for a case, $100 for two years of accidental breakage coverage, and maybe $60 for a keyboard. A MacBook Air at $1100 suddenly doesn't look all that expensive anymore, especially if you opt for the 128GB option of the iPad. Of course there is nothing like holding one of these new iPads and they are super sweet. If you are super logical and conservative, this is probably not the device for you.On the other hand, I decided to jump in both feet first.Setup was super fast and easy. There is a good step-by-step wizard to get the device running. Since I have an iCloud account, I was blown away with how fast this thing synced. That whole improved WiFi antenna is not hype - the device connected quickly with my network. Most devices take a while to connect to my network, this was painless and fast. Filling in the information for my mail account, it seemed like seconds and new email was downloaded - significantly faster than my other iPad.I had a choice during set up to restore from a backup or set up the unit as new. I chose new device, so none of my apps loaded right away. If I had chosen a backup, I could plug this into my computer and with iTunes could have grabbed my purchased apps. All incredibly seamless.Video is stunning. Amazon Prime Video took seconds to start (I've gotten used to 15-20 seconds). The video started in standard def, and within 15 seconds switched to high def. So much faster than happens even on my PS3. I have never seen buffering move this fast, scanning forward, there was a 5 second delay for buffering and the movie resumed. Sound is much better than the single speaker. It is still not great, just more passable. It is silly that they put two speakers on the bottom of the iPad. A speaker on top and bottom would give movies stereo. Music sounds better. Two speakers put out more sound, the stereo effect is minimal, the two speakers are one inch apart.This is an incredible display for films. The blacks are deep, rich, and have great tone range. Out of the box, this display looks fantastic.Everything moves so darn fast. Switching apps is a snap. New apps load with a blink of an eye.I'm glad I bought the full size iPad; Apple got this size and weight exactly right. I think this is well worth the extra $100 over the retina mini to be released the end of November. Apple has blurred the lines between these two devices. I guess they've done the same thing with iPods, so it makes sense they would do it with the iPad.If you've used iOS 7 on an iPhone, the iPad is essentially the same thing - you will feel right at

I own an iPad 2 and 3 and now this new iPad Air version.  My main reasons for updating were that I literally fill up my 64 GIG iPad every day or two with videos and photos that I shoot.  Having this larger version at 128 GIG allows me to work longer and add more to my iPad.  In addition this new version is much lighter and easier to use all day long.  Even though the battery is smaller in capacity than my iPad 3 the battery life is longer and it is very noticeable. This is because the faster A7 CPU and the motion chip actually use less power.Please watch my video as I go into more details in it.I immediately noticed the increase in speed.  The unit connects to the WIFI faster, synchs with iTunes faster, downloads emails faster and speeds up your web browsing.  The differences are very noticeable and enjoyable as a user.  The dual speakers are a nice change but I also use a lot of Bluetooth speakers to enhance the sound of the iPad.In my video I do a size and weight comparison to an iPad 2, an iPad 3 and the iPad Air.  I also show how the basic set up takes place and for advanced users you can just speed through that portion of the video.  The iPad 2 weighs 1 pound 5 1/8 ounces, the iPad 3 weighs 1 pound 7 1/8 ounces, and the iPad Air weighs 1 pound and \u00bc ounce.  The iPad Air is narrower but has the same screen size.  The left and right edges of the iPad are thinner on the sides of the useable screen and you can see that in the video.Here are the key improvements for me:* Much lighter in weight* Thinner, smaller design with the same screen size* Much faster when synching with iTunes* Much faster when browsing the web* Much faster when downloading emails* Stronger WIFI connection and faster WIFI synching* A more powerful AC wall adapter with 5.2 VDC and an output of 2.4 Amps.  It charges at 12 watts of power. It operates at 100 to 240 VAC and 50/60 Hz and it is UL approved.  It features folding AC wall plugs for easy packing when traveling.* Lower CPU and motion chip power consumption that makes the smaller/lighter internal battery last longer!  This is very noticeable!* As usual a beautiful high resolution retina screen with 2048 by 1536 resolution at 264 pixels per inch.

I would have paid a little more for the iPad Air with that sensor.This is still a 5 star product and I recommend it as a very good tablet.", "Date": "November 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Beautiful product, non-premium hardware.", "Author": "Avenging Taco", "ReviewID": "R52KR35VM0NQ3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have owned several Apple products, and the iPad is the most distinguished among Apple's line up relative to its competition.  The most compelling aspects of this tablet are the beautiful design, and the 10 hour battery life.  These are the two features that made me decide to purchase another Apple product irrespective of their business practices which try to squeeze money out of their customers by not supporting devices properly after they are released.After having used this product for over a month now, I can say it is an improvement over my iPad 1.  The browser now crashes on the original to the point of making it worthless.  My original iPad had 256 MB of RAM which is not enough to load a lot of modern web pages without the browser crashing.  That is why I had hoped the 1 GB of RAM in the iPad Air would be sufficient, and it has improved, yet I still find that the browser crashes on occasion.  The scroll latency is very subtle, but noticeable to me.  It doesn't really impact my usage, but it could create problems for people who game on their iPads.  Putting in 2 GB of RAM (which is what I have in my Nexus 4) does not cost that much, and would improve the performance greatly.  For a premium product, I expect the best, and Apple has consistently under-delivered on processing hardware which created the same problems all the way back to the iPhone 1 I purchased on launch day.I take 1 star off for business practices which burn through your pocket, and the second star is removed for needless low-RAM browser crashes that are still a problem on the latest iteration (which is likely planned to force relegation of old devices and compel new sales.)  Still, I can say that this is the best 10 inch tablet available, and android has no viable alternative worth purchasing.  If you can overlook the two biggest strikes I have against Apple, you should consider no other 10 inch tablet at this time.UPDATE 1/17/14Today I called into Apple support because my browser is crashing frequently.  I am now experiencing 5 - 10 browser crashes a day when it was only 2 - 3 times a week when I first purchased it.  Speaking with the Apple support technician, he said that they have not received many complaints about this issue yet, so I may be experiencing a rare software or hardware problem.  I looked through my crash log (which had over 100 crash reports in it since Nov. 11th) and the vast majority of them were low memory crashes.  However, the tablet did not operate this way when I initially purchased it, and it began to increase in frequency about 2 weeks ago.  Therefore I suspect that there is a software conflict (I still have 4 GBs of free flash hard drive space, so I doubt it is a conflict with virtual memory, although a RAM hardware problem is possible).  I went through some basic procedures the technician recommended, and I was advised to do a system wipe if the problems should persist.  I will test the tablet for a few days before wiping everything and starting over. I'll update this review once I am confident of what the issue was.", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Apple still rules the tablet world.", "Author": "Makavelli02", "ReviewID": "R3AWGSO5C50M8A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of let me tell you I am not an apple fanboy. I own and support samsung products. I carry a galaxy note 2 with me every day and would not consider an iPhone until the make some huge changes to it. Last year I bought a nexus 7 and loved it. Now that it's specs are getting a little dated I had to look for an upgrade. The new nexus 7 didn't impress me with it's dated CPU. So I looked to the note 2014 and the iPad air. I used both side by side and researched every detail. I sell these things for a living. The note is very impressive but, for all it's stats and hardware features it still struggles with simple movements. You can point out is 3 gigs of ram and the very good snapdragon 800 quad core CPU. Then you have apples 1 gig of ram with the measly dual core a7 CPU. ????? Now for the real world facts and it pains me to say this because I love android, but the fact is the a7 in the iPad air with it's upgraded clock speed at 1.39 gigs has yet to be matched in any bench mark from another mobile processor including the quad core s 800 by snapdragon. And with the future in mind the 64 bit tech is hard to beat. Them to the 1 gig of ram vs the 3 gigs in the note. If you can't use all that horsepower why put it in there. The air is twice as snappy as the note with no lag what so every. The note on the other hand lags even on swiping through home screens. It all comes down to the operating system apple remains king. Android may be pretty and customizable but that all comes at a cost. That cost is performance. You can take a car with 500 horsepower and put it on a curvy bending road. All that horsepower doesn't mean a thing. The car with 200 horsepower will still win by going straight.So I bought the air and love it.

They all went back to the store after much disappointment & I would go back to reading on the Kindle App.The iPad Air has become my mini workstation, paired with an Apple wireless keyboard, my library, my entertainment zone where I watch movies, play games & listen to music. I can also shop, do research-the list is endless! The device is as light as air even with a leather cover. It stays cool-no overheating. It is fast & with 128g, there is room for what interests me.

I've had original iPad, iPad 3, and now the Air. Many people may say iPad is not worth the price for what it does, but in my case, it was worth every penny. I used iPad 3 and now the Air mostly for browsing the web, reading textbooks, and occasional gaming, and for these tasks iPad Air is perfect; not to mention, I've saved a couple of hundreds on textbooks already. Air is much lighter and faster than the other iPads I've had so far. Now, I can easily hold it longer while reading longer texts, and I can see the performance increase in web browsing and games.Mini vs. Air DilemmaI first got the new iPad Mini with Retina display, because the Apple sales person said it is identical to iPad Air in every aspect other than screen size. Of course it turned out to be wrong, since mini is a bit slower and has the display color accuracy issue. After a week, I went back and exchanged the mini for iPad Air. While mini is a wonderful tablet, I was keeping it much closer to my eyes that I liked to. Web browsing also suffered a lot on a smaller screen of the mini even with Retina. With iPad Air, everything is back to normal again, and I can browse the web more easily now.Wi-Fi vs. 4G CellularI have had the cellular version of iPad 3 and the original iPad. To be honest, I only enabled the service for a few months and disabled it afterwards. I find myself to be always near Wi-Fi networks, either at school or work, so I decided to get the Wi-Fi version this time. Another reason was that I can always turn on the Hot-Spot feature on my phone, and share the internet with iPad Air. Because of these points, it didn't make any sense to pay $130 more for the cellular version.Games and PerformanceI've tried a few games, including Dead Trigger 2, and the 3D performance is very good. The new A7 processor really shines here. I am sure new wave of 3D and 64-bits games will come to iPad pretty soon, and if you are into gaming, definitely go with larger than 16GB models. The web browsing performance has been increased as well, so you can browse the web more fluidly.ConclusionI am pretty happy with my purchase. The free iLife and iWork packages with the purchase of new iPad from Apple sealed the deal for me. It is much better than my previous iPad 3, and I definitely love the new reduced weight. The performance increase is also noticeable both in games and web browsing.

I am neither an apple/pc/android fanboy, I use the tool that gets the job done reliably. (Ever have a paper due and your computer breaks down?) I own a macbook, iphone, windows desktop, and had a Nexus 7 for a short time but wanted a tablet with a larger screen.So lets get down to it- initial impression was \"Wow!\" and I never realized how chunky or laggy the Nexus 7 was. The resolution, animations, user interface, and general build quality is superb in my opinion. It feels like a device \"that will get work done\". Unfortunately, the iPad out of the box feels like a digital storefront for the App store as opposed to something I can do school work on. Bluntly, the device is unnecessarily handicapped. For me to put my own videos on it, I have to use Handbrake and waste 3-4 hours to convert the movie to something the iPad can play. The Nexus 7 played almost any format out of the box. Using textbook PDFs is horrible, there are only a few quality apps that offer continuous scrolling. If your course requires mymathlabs, webassign, or one of those other edu-gimmicks to do homework, good luck, most of them require Flash which is unsupported. Then I went to use safari.. advertisements everywhere! Same with every free app, constant advertisements! Occasionally I have to download PDF to read for course work. Ain't happening in safari- there is no way to download and the page will refresh if you close the app. Good luck reading where there is no wifi.Then I jailbroke it, installed f.lux, adblockerNetworks, safari downloader, nitrous, retinapad, vplayer video player, and videopane. That took care of the blinding blue light at night time, killed off 90% of advertisements, I can download files now, iPhone only apps are now in HD, I can watch almost any format of video too. Now the device is useful!After that, I installed DocsToGo to read PDFs with continuous scrolling and to write papers. I also HIGHLY recommend Notes Plus if you intend on hand writing notes. Lastly, I would suggest getting the \"Papers\" app (no typo) to read PDFs with multiple columns.Overall, iPad has a lot of potential but is held back by Apples walled garden. After jailbreaking and eliminating the majority of the artificial handicaps, I feel OK with heading to school only with it and not worrying about it not being capable of doing something.

I own an iPad 2 and 3 and now this new iPad Air version. My main reasons for updating were that I literally fill up my 64 GIG iPad every day or two with videos and photos that I shoot. Having this larger version at 128 GIG allows me to work longer and add more to my iPad. In addition this new version is much lighter and easier to use all day long. Even though the battery is smaller in capacity than my iPad 3 the battery life is longer and it is very noticeable. This is because the faster A7 CPU and the motion chip actually use less power.Please watch my video as I go into more details in it.I immediately noticed the increase in speed. The unit connects to the WIFI faster, synchs with iTunes faster, downloads emails faster and speeds up your web browsing. The differences are very noticeable and enjoyable as a user. The dual speakers are a nice change but I also use a lot of Bluetooth speakers to enhance the sound of the iPad.In my video I do a size and weight comparison to an iPad 2, an iPad 3 and the iPad Air. I also show how the basic set up takes place and for advanced users you can just speed through that portion of the video. The iPad 2 weighs 1 pound 5 1/8 ounces, the iPad 3 weighs 1 pound 7 1/8 ounces, and the iPad Air weighs 1 pound and \u00bc ounce. The iPad Air is narrower but has the same screen size. The left and right edges of the iPad are thinner on the sides of the useable screen and you can see that in the video.Here are the key improvements for me:* Much lighter in weight* Thinner, smaller design with the same screen size* Much faster when synching with iTunes* Much faster when browsing the web* Much faster when downloading emails* Stronger WIFI connection and faster WIFI synching* A more powerful AC wall adapter with 5.2 VDC and an output of 2.4 Amps. It charges at 12 watts of power. It operates at 100 to 240 VAC and 50/60 Hz and it is UL approved. It features folding AC wall plugs for easy packing when traveling.* Lower CPU and motion chip power consumption that makes the smaller/lighter internal battery last longer!

Others about the brightness...indeed I do have it cranked all the way up but the brightness is nowhere as bright as what is found on the Samsung Note 10.1 2014 edition, nor the iPad4 and my most recent purchase the Samsung Note 8. All 3 when cranked all the way up are much brighter than the iPad Air.I will be buying the new Google nexus 7(even with all the GPS and multi-touch issues) for the upcoming holidays but even in the store, that too seems much brighter...I am very dismayed at this lack of brightness from the Air but it is still more than adequate for indoors. I have not tried it outdoors nor will I as this is not my \"outdoor\" tablet...lol.I like Apple and the tight integration of their apps and the reason many including myself continue to buy their products. I do feel the price for this latest iteration is them trying to make money at our expense. WHO HERE DOES NOT KNOW IN THEIR HEART THAT APPLE IS TRYING TO GET IN ON THE CHRISTMAS RUSH AND PUT THE AIR AND THE NEW MINI WITHOUT THE FINGERPRINT FEATURES FOUND ON THE NEW IPHONE...COME MARCH MAYBE APRIL, APPLE WILL UPDATE THE IPAD AIR TO INCLUDE THAT FEATURE.I will continue to buy Apple mostly because their store has apps that are better, with more choices and work extremely well with their devices. I think this product is a 3 1/2 Stars at best and mostly for the size and weight reduction that is very significant. I feel the \"glass\" is too thin but seems to be durable as I have really been typing a lot on it as well as playing several games that require a lot of tapping. I am very happy with the size reduction but feel the brightness is not up to par with other new tablets or the iPad4.Recently the Safari browser has been \"crashing\" a lot over the past week in that when you tap on a hyperlink, the browser will basically disappear off the screen. None of the tabs close but it just disappears and returns you to the home screens. I also am finding the browser will get stuck/freeze for several minutes before resuming. I have several calls in with apple support and they are looking into the issues.Other issues is the VIDEO app, if you play a video via streaming not downloading and leave it somewhere like the middle or so on, it actually reduces your available memory by the amount you have watched from what I can glean. IT IS LIKE DOWNLOADING THE MOVIE TO THE POINT YOU HAVE WATCHED IT TO EVEN THOUGH YOU SELECTED THE STREAMING LINK. If you do this with several movies, you can basically wipe out your free memory. I find it difficult to clear the buffer and have basically learned to tell the app not to display any movies then to display movies then play the movie but move the slider to the beginning and press stop playing then done. Of these many steps I eventually clear the buffer but I am not sure which of all these steps actually is what does it if any!Oh lastly, the WI-fi is fantastic.FINAL RATING IS 3 1/2 STARS...MAYBE 4 IF NOT FOR THE BRIGHTNESS ISSUE.First I own iPad 2 and 4 and Samsung Note 10.1 2014 edition.I like...not love...the new iPad Air as it is faster both in operating the software apps and graphic intensive apps. The apps continue to be fantastic for all the pads not just the Air.Apple did a great job on the weight but FEEL STRONGLY THAT THE NEW SCREEN IS NOT NEARLY AS BRIGHT AS MY iPad 4 NOR DOES IT EVEN FEEL LIKE GLASS.As I type this review on the Air, the \"cheap tapping\" feel of this glass leaves me wondering how durable this glass is. It feels thin and makes a tapping sound not found on the more solid glass on my other two iPads.Oh I am keeping the Air for the faster processors but feel Apple has put out a product whose screen will not be as durable as prior pads.I can see it flex when I push down on it with minimal effort and have some light distortion when I press down like old type LED TVS.Apple over prices their products because they can and really did so on this iteration of their iPad. In my estimation the glass feels like plastic and the brightness is much diminished when compared to my iPad 4 and so must have a higher profit margin with all these cost cutting that resulted in a new iPad that for all practically purposes is just faster but not as solidly built as prior pads.Time will tell on the screen and maybe this is the way all tablets are headed to achieve the weight reduction and thinness. I love the ability to hold the Air in one hand comfortably for much longer than any of my current tablets. I am OK to sacrifice the glass quality as long as the touch screen does not suffer or long term screen reliability.I wish Apple would splurge and include a 6 foot charging cord...OMG $600 for 32GB and the cord is so short still after all this time...lol.", "Date": "November 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worst iPad Ever", "Author": "SanPa", "ReviewID": "R6AXD3MO1PMIA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I'll get right to it.

For the past few years I've used Android FroYo, Gingerbread, Ice Cream Sandwich, and now Jelly Bean. I also have a Kindle Fire HD. The iPad Air is my first iPad, and I chose to go with the iPad Air because it has a much higher resolution than the best Android Tablets, with a really slick dual-core CPU and quad-core GPU. The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 is a close second but is more expensive than the iPad Air which was on sale during a Black Thursday promotion. The Galaxy Tab 3 just doesn't even come close with the screen resolution.The iOS 7 interface is OK. I prefer Jelly Bean's interface. Although clean and simple, the iOS interface isn't intuitive. There are too many sub-menus interwoven in odd areas. To change language, I have to go into no less than 2 sub-menu layers. Siri is fine, but Google Now/Google Search was far more intelligent and effective. Siri's default US female voice is much more realistic and smoother, but Google Now's other voices along with IVONA rectify that situation fairly well.The battery life on the iPad Air is very good. After an hour or so, I'm still above 90%. The WiFi is fast, and the overall UI is smooth. The movie/graphics playback is super fast. I can watch Flash based movies/video within the Safari browser without any hiccups.Compared to my 7 inch Kindle Fire HD, I felt that the 9.7 inch (Air's display size) or 10 inch screen size is just right, but only because the iPad Air is extremely thin and lightweight. The 7 inch KFHD is large enough to be usable for reading magazines, but it is not a good use of space. I have to flick through 2 or 3 screens while the iPad Air will show the entire page (in a very legible font size) in one screen. The KFHD is also heavy, so hopefully the new KFHDX is thinner and lighter.I used to make fun of Apple for going with the Lightning connector, but after using it up close, I can understand why it is innovative. It is made out of a solid chunk of metal with contacts on both sides. There's no \"right\" way of plugging it in, unlike USB where I constantly flip it around trying to figure out which side is up. But I still feel micro-USB is the right way to go, due to its universal acceptance with devices. The included 12W power adapter can actually charge the iPad Air at up to 14W of power based on what I saw with my Kill-A-Watt.With respect to the hardware and design, the iPad Air is outstanding at this price point. Aside from the hardware, the bulk of the iPad Air and Apple experience centers around iTunes, iCloud, and other Apple software. This is an area where I feel Google far surpasses Apple. The Apple ID system is cumbersome and annoying to use. I had to login probably a dozen times during the registration process, and buying/installing free apps required me to enter my password each time. It didn't seem like all of Apple's programs were tightly integrated because I had to use my Apple ID each time I fired up the apps for the first time. Once everything was setup and installed, it seemed fine. That said, installing and running Google's apps on the iPad was significantly less painful. The first time I used my Google account for an app (I believe it was YouTube), all of the other Google Apps recognized me and started syncing. Google Now/Google Search also puts Siri to shame, albeit Siri seems more \"human\" with basic functions. For instance, asking about the weather, Siri actually told me (In Chinese and English) that the weather wasn't very good at 27F. Doing basic searches, Siri and Google Now are about equal, but Google Now seems more intelligent with some of the intermediate activities like unit conversions or advanced searches.I never liked iTunes in the past, and my opinion has not changed with ITunes 11. It is overly complex to use. With Google/Android, I can access Play with a browser and have new apps sent to my devices with the greatest of ease. Syncing calendar events, email, contacts, etc... is also far easier with just using a browser versus the iTunes program on my PC. The good news is that iTunes isn't too bad to use on the iPad. Running Zinio, Conde Naste magazine apps, and other apps was smooth and problem-free.For those that like to use their tablet for browsing or reading magazines, or watching videos, I'd highly recommend a 10 inch display (the Air is 9.7\" but falls in the range). My 7 inch Kindle Fire is fine to use, but it is frustrating to use for magazines due to the amount of panning that is needed. After using the iPad Air, my Samsung Galaxy S3 feels claustrophobic with its 4.9\" display.Overall: 5/5 stars, the iPad Air is a well-designed device with great hardware especially with the Black Thursday/Friday promotions. However, Apple has a lot of catching up to do with respect to its software designs. I very much prefer Google's ecosystem as it is more \"cloud-based\" than what Apple is trying to do.

However, when I travel, I will use a 5 oz cover or just a Smart Cover (3.5 oz).I know it can be dangerous, not using a case, but I am extremely careful and i bought the special Apple warranty.

I have to admit I read all about the new Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 and I bought it two weeks ago. the specs were awesome for the price. the only thing is a lot of the things I needed were not compatible with it. then my granddaughter tried to facetime with me and of course I couldn't because  Kindle doesn't have facetime. I told we would both have to download Skype to teleconference with eachother and she said forget it. too much trouble.  then I'd have to buy new extra chargers/cables etc. just too much incompatibility. so I returned it and bought this and I'm thrilled and happy with it. if I wasn't used to Apple products I would have kept the the Kindle. just being honest as I don't want anyone to think that the Kindle wasn't good", "Date": "November 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Disappointed first time apple customer", "Author": "Ginfx", "ReviewID": "R3PXX0AJCUBKMP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was excited to purchase my first apple product. This unit was purchased from another retailer as part of a bundle and offered flexible payments. I was looking at the Air laptop, but then heard iPad air was coming out.  Sadly it will be going back.  iPad air is thin, lightweight, perfect size screen.The color is super sharp.  Super fast typing and going from app to app,, when it wanted to work. Which meant I really couldn't tell you if they worked well or not.  I'd only had it for a day and the screen froze.  Could only go back to the home screen, then loose any work one might have done. Couldn't turn it off. Then, when I was getting ready to put it back in the box, amazingly it decided to work. The set-up wizard was super fast helping this technically challenged person set up and link  all her accounts.  I REALLY liked that it was a tablet and a small laptop as it came with an awesome keypad. So then I started downloading music and wanted to hear the small ball speaker that came in the bundle. The female plug in the air was not quite the right size. I couldn't get a snug fit, also tried with the ear buds and another speaker. And as I fidgeted with the plugs to get a secure connection to receive a signal, the song would stop playing and the volume on the screen kept going up and down. Is this supposed to happen???? As for the sound, I wasn't expecting much from such a thin tablet. The speakers were on the back side but I'm not sure if speakers could be placed in the front. But since the speaker plugs won't fit, what's the point? You'd need to buy some blue-tooth speakers to really hear better soundIt would be hard for me to compare the ipad air to other tablets as this would have been my first touch-screen device other than my android smart phone.I'd have to agree with previous reviews. I also feel this device was rushed on the market before X-mas. With the screen freezing and the plug being poorly made, is a good indication of frantically putting something together and getting it on the market for the holidays. I really hope that the next generation iPad air will be greatly improved as I really like apple products,and software, and was hoping this would be the first.Apple, I am disappointed.

The need for both color for children's books and my own need for a white background to provide contrast when reading were my primary motivators.  The price and versatility of the Kindle were better than other options available.  I do not use my device as a media player, but that seemed to be a nice option.  However, my spouse insisted I look at the \"Apple iPad Air\" before I made any purchase.After looking at the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" and the \"Apple iPad Air\" side-by-side in the big electronics retailer, I had to admit it, he was right!  Clarity on both devices was excellent, particularly as I intended to use the item primarily as an e-reader.  However, the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" kept freezing up; the blue shirted employees said that was a frequent occurrence.  The \"Apple iPad Air\" connected easily to WiFi and navigation was smooth and seamless.  The ability to use many of the same programs I have installed on my PC is a plus.  Downloading books is quick and the \"Apple iPad Air\" does not bog down so that it seems painfully slow when I try to change from a book to the main menu page.  Using the \"Apple iPad Air\" is intuitive, even for those individuals - like me -who are not especially tech-savvy.  Based on recommendations and the fact that I would use the tablet when traveling, I purchased the \"Apple iPad Air\" 16 GB with the ability to connect to AT&T.;The principle downside of purchasing the \"Apple iPad Air\" is its initial cost.  Individuals who are debating between purchasing a Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" and an \"Apple iPad Air\" should look at the two side-by-side; consider their primary uses and personal preferences; and evaluate the price difference in light of those factors.  While I don't like having to admit my spouse was right, I do love my \"Apple iPad Air\".

I mentioned Samsung because I love their phones, tv's, etc. However, when comparing the note to the iPad, I opted for the iPad. One very big reason is I love to buy, rent, download movies to watch. Having an iTunes account makes this so very simple. Also, I have a ton of iTunes credit (I always ask for iTune gift cards whenever the occassion arises). In addition to iTunes, I love Pages. When I got this app, it was free! However, if you do a lot of word processing, you might want to invest in this much needed addition. The great thing about Pages is you can send as a PDF or Word doc via email.Some are trying to decide if they should buy a 16, 32, 64, etc. Speaking from experience, a 16 will not be enough for must adults, but would be fine for a child. I know you can store in the \"cloud\". However, you have to have a wifi in order to retrieve from the \"cloud\" unless you have the iPad with a cellular service (which to me, is a waste). So, having your documents available whenever needed is a plus. Therefore, a minimum of 32 would be great.All said, I love gadgets and technology. I love having the latest, and that is why with each new model, I will upgrade. However, I think this iPad air will be mine for many years - of course I say that until the next iPad air comes out with the finger print scanner and I will tell myself, \"must have\".If you own one, enjoy!

As an upgrade from prior iPad's, the Air is going to be the biggest reason to upgrade in recent memory. Users from the 3rd Generation down will see substantial benefits to speed alone.What Works:It's substantially lighter. Easier to hold and use while watching movies or reading a book.It's substantially faster. The upgraded processor is so fast that most users will be future proofed for the next two years or more. 64 bit processing will give this tablet some legs.the battery charges substantially faster. This is a nicer reason to upgrade than most realize. The Air's battery is smaller, and holds it's charge very well compared to older models on iOS7. I had problems on my 3rd gen keeping it charged compared to the zippier charging Air.Lightning port is much more convenient, easier to plug in compared to 3rd generation and back.Speakers seem to pack more of a punch.What doesn't work:the screen has a slightly hollow and thin feel on the finger. As a consequence of a lighter tablet it's expected that the display lost some of it's heft.the volume buttons are spaced a little too far apart for me. Harder to press.volume speakers are annoyingly where you'd hold the tablet horizontally.-----That's my impressions with the tablet. My recommendation is if you have $500 or more to spend on a tablet, the iPad Air is going to be your first choice. Android hasn't been competitive in this section of the market. If you're looking for a less expensive, smaller tablet, then you're going to be looking at the Kindle devices or the Android devices.For Apple users, i'd recommend people on the 1st and 2nd gen devices take the plunge, the changes are enough to warrant the upgrade. 3rd Gen users are in the grey area. They are not going to see any difference in screen quality, and the speed of the Air may not be too large to matter for basic use. 4th Gen users are totally fine where they are.", "Date": "November 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "They Sent me a used iPad......WTF????", "Author": "Marcus Scott-Morgan", "ReviewID": "RUZ0K3ME024YE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I cant believe these guys had the nerve to send me an iPad air with no factory seal around the unit.I then proceeded to charge the iPad for the first time.

Nothing else compares to the bright screen on the iPad Air, or the way that it feel resting ever so lightly in your hands.  It just feels right.And that is what Apple has done so right.

I wont buy another iPad from amazon though because what I have come to realize is that the warranty starts from the date the seller purchased the product meaning that I only have a few months left on this warranty. I'm just glad I figured this out sooner rather than later. Excellent product overall and great customer service from amazon in sorting out the issue.-Update- I have since received my refund and purchased a new iPad from Apple. What I realized immediately was how differently this one was packaged. The one I ordered on amazon did not come sealed and did not have plastic on either the screen or the back.

And if you are using this for the sole purpose of creating, sharing, and presenting documents, maintaining your schedule, and taking a few photos. That's great. However, I  tend to watch a few movies, but considering that I only actually have 12 GB of memory after software, large apps like pages and keynote, books, and few photos (less than 100) are taken into account, I can only put one on at a time, which gets a little old after awhile. The fact that apply doesn't allow expanded memory like memory cards still frustrates me to this day because you never know what you may want to put on your tablet in the future, and this leaves you no room to breathe. I hate the restrictions and the only real reason why I decided to get the IPad over the Samsung Note series is because the app store is incredible and much more versatile. I will certainly NEVER get another IPhone after having a Samsung galaxy unless Apple introduces the expanded memory.Anyway, moral of the story: Ipad Air is sleek, light, fast, functions well, has a great display and app store (that just being Apple in general).

The available memory is more like 11-12 gb because the OS takes up the rest of the space.

I got it the day it came out in stores. It starts with the ultra-sharp exterior. If you loved last year's iPad Mini, you'll feel right at home with the Air. Apple essentially built a larger version of the Mini with the Air, by slimming the beveling of previous iPads to achieve a sleeker framework.The lack of heft makes the Air just a little more comfortable: An LTE-equipped Air weighs all of 1.05 pounds. Wrapped in a comfy and protective Apple Smart Case, the Air weighs 1.368 pounds, still lighter than a third-generation iPad by itself. Despite the lack of size, the Air is no less tough. It's sturdy and not at all easy to bend.The Air feels that much more like an electronic magazine. The Retina display, once the standard for all screens but also facing more competition this year, helps that; reading text and viewing web pages on that crystal-clear, pixel-dense screen is the same joy it was when Apple first built Retina screens into its tablets early last year.If this is all Apple did, it would likely still be enough to keep it on top. But the iPad Air does far more, starting with the new processor powering the entire experience, the A7. The same dual-core, 64-bit A7 chip that debuted in the iPhone 5S is in the iPad Air; and initially, this seems like a disappointment. In theory, you expect something more in Apple's flagship tablet, something a bit more powerful, with perhaps more graphical horsepower.In practice, you won't notice a thing. Web browsing and apps still handle as snappily as ever, even if you have a gaggle of things running in the background. Top-tier games such as Infinity Blade 3 continue to deliver. A pleasant surprise is also how quickly some of the beefier games, such as Anomaly 2, loaded, compared to previous iPads. You'll move into and out of levels just a little bit more swiftly, and that helps make the entire gaming experience more friendly and natural. It's hard to know what this really means for Apple gaming, but don't rule out the possibility of more console titles being ported to the iPad.Apple realizes the limitations of the 64 GB storage too, offering a new 128-gig model. You'll pay a more-than-average-laptop premium here ($799 for the WiFi-only model and $929 for an LTE version), but the improved storage is intriguing, especially for those planning for a game-heavy future. I can now easily and comfortably load all the music and movies onto the iPad Air that I want and still have plenty of room left over for games such as XCOM: Enemy Unknown and Civilization: Revolutions.Battery life is steady, even if it's not mind-blowing. Apple claims the iPad Air can get you 10 hours on a charge, and that's definitely true. Even when using Apple's navigation for a long trip to Washington, I easily got through a day without needing to charge; and more casual usage, such as Web browsing and email checks, is no problem.The Air's lone shortcoming is that it lacks the fingerprint identification technology that debuted on the iPhone 5S. But I'd be hard-pressed to claim that this was some glaring omission; every other tablet you're going to use this year lacks such tech, and I've never seen that tech as an absolute must-have.The resulting tablet is as pleasant to use as they come, and it's backed by some consistently solid software. Android has made a tremendous run over the past few years, and a plethora of both Android and Windows Mobile devices are truly intriguing this holiday season.

Apple constantly thrives to improve there products, and this one is no exception. The new IOS coupled with the blazing fast 64-bit a7 chip makes this one of the fastest tablets I have used! The ease and simplicity of this tablet makes everyday emails, messaging, projects,etc. no problem. This is the only tablet I have looked forward to using.Now for more serious activities like gaming and other intensive applications, the iPad has no problems what so ever. The graphics are very smooth, almost life-like.  From the outside, this is the most beautiful tablet hands down. From the chamfered edges to the sleek aluminum back, this is a high quality device. Most other tablets are made out of cheap plastics, not this one. Everything feels well made and solid. Even though apple chose to use metals and other high end materials, the iPad remains one of the lightest and thinnest full size tablets you can buy. Another high point for the iPad air its the battery. It seems to go on forever! After using it throughout the day, I end up with 70 to 80 percent battery! Its unbelievably how much juice this thing holds! Some miscellaneous things about the iPad that push it even further over the top are the decent cameras and the excellent microphones and speakers. The speakers have a good base tone and very clear high pitches. Overall I would recommend this tablet to anyone looking for a device that can do pretty much anything.

Let's hope that those who are coming here for 'guidance' are also reading professional reviews from trusted media sources .. and .. talking to actual users of the product.My review: After trying several of the latest high resolution tablets on the market I returned all but one, the iPad Air. I can't find a thing about it to complain about (except the price). It's just outstanding in every way (display, size, weight, available apps, and operating system). It also addressed certain niggling complaints I had with my earlier iPads. With regard to other devices I tried, the latest Kindle Fires were excellent (great displays - and the price was right) but not sufficiently versatile to meet all my needs. The LG 8.3 was another excellent Android tablet but it didn't seem like a truly finished product (couldn't, for instance, lock it in landscape mode - very frustrating when trying to use it while lying in bed). It also seemed a bit pricy for what it was at nearly the price of an iPad Mini Retina (a tablet I was seriously considering for its portability). For what it's worth, the only tablets I tried, or even wanted to try, were those with very high pixel density displays. Later I also ruled out the true 7 inch devices with their 22 square inch displays (the iPad Mini's is 30 square inches, the LG 8.3's is 31, while the iPad Air's is 45). In other words, most of what else was out there had screens that were either too small or displays that were not sufficiently retina like.", "Date": "November 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Receive a used one when pay for new", "Author": "Tommy Le", "ReviewID": "RNMMX58FSREJA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Bought iPad air 128GB.

Even though it didn't have a front or back camera. I didn't mind.It's pretty heavy so, i just layed it down on a tablemost of the time. It was all fun and games, until the ios7 update came out a few months ago. After the new update,I could barely do anything on it. All of my favorite apps were no longer useable and, I had to delete them all because theyrequired the new update. After ios7, the first gen ipad suddenly became useless and, I felt cheated out on the amount ofmoney that was spent on that ipad. I'm very surprised that the ipad 1 only costs 200 hundred dollars less than the new one.Even though generation one is a discontinued model. In my opinion, it should be off the market completely. Why bothergetting this outdated device, when you can buy the newest one for $200 more? The ipad air has a completely different feel to it. It's a hundred times lighter.The iPad air has so much new things like Siri. Some people may think asking a electronic device to do something for you might be a bit lazy but, you can make a reminder within 5 seconds without leaving your current app. Siri has better results when searching for something specific. It's also helpful if you're slow at texting or, if your hands are full. Browsing the web is a lot faster but, downloading an app may take a while depending on your Internet connection.

After a few days of using the iPad Air and iPad 3 I can tell that an upgrade would not be worth the hassle of putting my older iPad on ebay and making up the difference which would be around $300 I guess (I have the 16 GB version) . Actually, a lot of professional reviewers online recommend exactly this: don't upgrade if you already have either an iPad 3 or iPad 4.The difference in size and weight is (slightly) noticeable when you are picking the device or holding it in your hands. The thing is that I never just hold my iPad in my hands when using it (and I do use it a lot!). Most of its weight goes either to the desk when I am at my desk, or to my lap if I am in my chair, or to my chest if I am on my couch. Which means I am basically using my hand(s) to balance the iPad not to support it. In such situations extra 7 ounces is not a big deal at all.If you are using your iPad differently (for example, playing games a lot) then you might appreciate the iPad Air better. Also, if you just want to have the latest and the coolest iPad then of course that would be worth it too :)Seems like Apple is following the same pattern with both the iPad 2 and the iPad Air, mostly squeezing the same device in a smaller package. This is not good enough for me. I waited until the iPad 3 came out to upgrade my iPad 1 (yes, Retina display was totally worth it!) and I hope that the iPad 6 will be worth an upgrade. But I am not getting into the hassle of replacing my iPad just to get a little bit thinner/narrower and lighter.Making the decision to return the iPad Air got even easier when I realized that its screen has a noticeable yellow tint which makes my iPad 3 look a bit bluish which I like better.Good bye, iPad Air, and lets hope that Apple will be able to impress even the most conservative of us with the iPad 6 in October 2014!

It is lighter, thinner, narrower, faster and has stereo speakers. Its almost half a pound lighter which really makes a difference when holding the ipad in your hands for long periods of time. I no longer need to use my ipad stand. Typing and holding it in portrait mode are much easier. People with larger hands will be able to hold the ipad with one hand very easily. Performance is also much improved with new A7 processor. Apps open, close and switch faster than on the ipad 4. Wifi is now double the speed with the double mimo antenna. For those who have supporting routers loading web pages, downloading apps, books, videos, music is much faster. The new stereo speakers are much loader and have more bass than on the previous ipad. The stereo affect will only be noticed when holding the iPad in portrait mode. This is a shame since you wont enjoy the stereo affect when watching a video or playing a game in landscape mode. Also the speakers are very easy to muffle if you cover one or both of them on the right side in landscape mode. The main flaw of the ipad air is its lack of 2GB of ram. When browsing and having more than a few tabs open this is very noticeable. The tabs have to reload when switching back and forth. This also becomes an issue when switching between apps that are open. Both the ipad 3 and 4 had 2GB of RAM. The only reason I can think of why apple decided not the upgrade the RAM is to make customers upgrade to the next ipad. The other downside to the ipad air is the fact that its running ios 7. ios 7 for the most part is in improvement over ios 6. It is faster and has more features, but, it also has many bugs that still need to be fixed. Even with 7.04 installed I still experience rotation issues. The ipad doesnt auto rotate when switching between portarit and landscape mode. This issue occurs atleast once a day. Mainly when the multitasking gestures is enabled and auto rotation. There are many threads on apple discussions forums about this issue. I thought at first my ipad was deffective even made an appointment to see a genius. I was told there was no way to test the hardware but was offered a warranty replacment. I decided instead to exchange the ipad and the replacement also had the same issue. I have to add also my ipad 4 had the same issue also when I updated it to ios 7. I hope apple fixes this issue in 7.1. This is very annoying and not something I expected from apple. The ipad air also doesnot have the ability to run 2 or more apps at one time which both the new samsung note 10.1 2014 and Microsoft surface tablet can do. I did try the samsung tablet briefly and found the screen and speakers much better than the ipad air's. The ipad still is the best larger tablet on the market because it has a huge selection of tablet apps and it gets the apps first before any other platform. I also love the battery life on my ipad air. I was getting about 15 hours of usage on my ipad 4 with the brightness at 35% and about 5 notifications with browsing and email. Now with the ipad air I am gettting more than 15 hours. Anywhere from 16-18 hours of battery life depending on my usage. The new ipad air is must have for gamers, power users and people who take the ipad on the go. If you can wait the next ipad will defeintly have 2GB of RAM and wont have as many bugs. There is also a good chance a new ipad will be released in the next 1-2 years which will be larger in screen size and more powerful named the ipad pro.Update after owning for more than 4 months: Apple just released the 7.1 update. My iPad Air is finally stable, this is what ios 7 should have been from the start. There are no more crashes, reboots and the auto rotation issue is fixed. I am still giving this ipad 4 stars since it took apple more than 4 months to fix these issues. Also the ipad lacks 2gb of ram, there are no widgets, thrid party keyboards, expandable storage or way to run 2 apps at once side by side. The iPad Air is till the best 10 inch tablet on the market. It beats any android or microsoft tabelt currently on the market in the 10 inch category. Also it has the most tablet apps.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "WOW", "Author": "Diane Allen", "ReviewID": "R95SPR015HRY8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What an amazing ipad!

In hindsight, I\u2019m glad I did otherwise I wouldn\u2019t have bought this tablet.Before deciding on the iPad Air I considered the Kindle Fire and Nexus 7. The Microsoft Surface wasn\u2019t an option since I really don\u2019t like the operating system or customer service and I wanted my tablet to last longer than a year. Samsung wasn\u2019t an option after the torture my Galaxy S3 put me through, which also ruled out Android, which then ruled out the Nexus 7. Some people are a fan of Android but I find it to be slow, unreliable and choppy. The aesthetic design isn\u2019t my favorite either. But these are all a matter of personal opinion and experience. :)The Kindle Fire HDX looked great at first, but in the end I decided it wasn\u2019t for me. I\u2019m a writer and a student so being able to edit documents on the go is my main concern. I have an iMac so this unfortunately made using the Kindle for these purposes a little more difficult for me. While I can edit and share most documents on my iMac, including Microsoft Office, I primarily use Pages which isn\u2019t available on the Kindle. I just don\u2019t care for either Microsoft Word or Google Docs enough to use them all the time. Also, I never use the Amazon store to watch movies or shows or download music so that feature wasn\u2019t appealing to me. I took a trip to Best Buy to try it out just in case that made me change my mind. This actually solidified my decision against it. While the Kindle Fire did feel surprisingly solid, I didn\u2019t like the position of the buttons, smaller screen size (although the screen quality was pretty awesome) or the thick boarders around the screen. Again, all of these are a matter of preference.When I went to try out the iPad Air I was surprised by how much lighter it felt than the previous model iPad. I also liked the flat back and thinner edges on the side. It made using it easier for small handed people like me. The larger screen size made typing on the tablet much easier in those rare instances I might not have my keyboard. Keeping my documents in one place is amazingly simple and I like the applications I use for writing and classes. Also, iTunes U is just awesome!The only drawback for me is the price: I paid $300 more than I would have with the Kindle Fire HDX. I don\u2019t think this is outrageously expensive, considering the larger screen, better hardware, operating system and customer service-- not to mention iTunes U-- but I do think the price could be lower.While there are other great tablets out there, I really enjoy my iPad Air. Electronics are all a matter of personal preference anymore anyway. If you don\u2019t like a device, don\u2019t buy it. It\u2019s that simple. :)", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Defective Item", "Author": "Nik", "ReviewID": "RUSB2R1PF1O2T", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Purchased this brand new iPad Air 64 GB from TechGiant(Amazon).

I've noticed this with my \"old\" Samsung Galaxy Tab 7 Plus, but this may not matter to some people.The Kindle HDX and Nexus 7 (2013) are, in that order, reported to have better screens- ppi and gamut display. However I'm not interested in buying too much into the Amazon App Store because I'm already in the plain Android ecosystem. The Samsung tablet line is not in consideration because I got burned by how the copy and paste function just stops working- a reset would fix it and soon after it would stop working. This issue first showed itself months after I got the device. I also wasn't interested in taking the time to jailbreak the Samsung tablet for that reason alone.I recently got a deal on the Nexus 7 (2013) and I'm getting it this week. I may keep it as a backup tablet and it's a plus that I'm already in the Android ecosystem. It has 2GB of RAM instead of Apple's current 1GB of RAM standard. It also comes with stock Android and the operating system can be easily upgraded without relying on mods. I'm hoping it will last 5 years but I've learned from the Amazon customer reviews that hardware quality control is an issue.Now back to the iPad Air. Aside from the screen I wanted the \"Apple Experience\" of \"It just works.\" I like using a tablet for browsing and reading books. I also liked the idea of having access to apps that are exclusive to Apple. I've had the iPad Air for a little over a week and I'm really enjoying the bigger screen. I'm not sure I can really switch back to a smaller screen. I've downloaded a few apps, cooking related, that are exclusive to iOS and they're nice to have. Multitouch gesture is ok but the Android way of switching between apps and viewing running apps are more elegant.Why I took off three stars is because the iPad Air crashes a lot. It got to the point that I'd add a tab on Safari and it would crash even though I only had two other tabs open. I installed Chrome and the crashes happened less but they did not disappear. Search for iOS 7 crashes and low memory and you'll see this is a problem with a lot of iOS devices since the iOS 7 was introduced. I noticed other apps doing the same thing but maybe because I use them less I don't see them crashing as often.I had set up a phone appointment with Apple Support on Sunday and was told that upgrading to iOS 7.0.4 via WiFi might have caused the iOS to not fully update. I couldn't stay on the phone for too long so yesterday I did reset my tablet and set the iPad as New. I didn't buy their reasoning but I did like the Customer Support experience- setting up an appointment online etc.I really like the bigger screen and it's probably better for my eyes so I'm keeping the device. I'm also counting on Apple to fix the issue sooner rather than later- in various forums you'll read about people resetting their iOS device and doing multiple exchanges with no relief from the crashing. I will sign up for Apple Care+ which includes 2 Years of Tech Support and Accidental Damage so I can exchange the device if needed.", "Date": "December 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not Worth the Money", "Author": "Galen V.", "ReviewID": "R3OIN717XK4VME", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Let's face it, Apple produces highly polished products with a rich app ecosystem.

You have very little customization options. Yes, you can change wallpaper and move icons around the homescreen, but that's about it. No making the device an extension of your personality like Android.*Speakers.

Up until then, I had never owned an Apple product. I have always had Windows pc\u2019s and I have an Android phone (Galaxy S4).I read that people just love the iPad\u2019s and thought it would be time to try out an Apple product. I bought it from T-Mobile to get their free data promotion. Now that I\u2019ve had one for about 3 months my overall opinion is \u201cmeh\u201d. It\u2019s ok.I don\u2019t hate it. It\u2019s light & portable. It\u2019s great for watching movies and listening to music. However, there are limitations that make me wonder why the devices are so popular. For example, Swype doesn\u2019t work on iPad\u2019s and if you\u2019ve ever used Swype on an Android device you know it\u2019s a great feature but one I consider very basic. True multi-tasking doesn\u2019t exist and you just don\u2019t realize how much you\u2019ll miss it until you don\u2019t have it. You can\u2019t print, for example, pages 1,3,&10 of a pdf. Instead, you can only choose a range, such as 1 thru 3. I still remember one of my first calls to Applecare+, where some young woman explained to me that you can\u2019t do a search in a pdf. She actually suggested that I add hundreds of doctors that were in the pdf to my contact list so that I could then find individual doctors. I quickly ended that call. The Apple browser, Safari, is slow. Chrome, on the other hand, is fast. These are only small examples but in general, the iPad seems to be much less flexible than my Window\u2019s computers or Android phone.As an aside, the support on Applecare+ varies widely. I have been connected to people that seem knowledgeable but have also had plenty of people that knew less about the iPad then I did, even after only 1 months use. Many of the young women referred to my iPad as an IPhone and didn\u2019t have a clue how to help me.They are also expensive. I bought the 32GB version and thought it was a rip off to pay $100 for the extra 16GB.Now, my iPad Air is 3 months old and needs to be exchanged under warranty. After 10 minutes of use it can\u2019t access the web anymore. Regardless of whether you use a browser or an app. They had me reset it back to the factory default but it didn\u2019t fix the problem. It's stayed in a case and never left the house. It's been babied. I\u2019ve never had any device fail after only 3 months use.I really wanted to love this device and thought I would based on other people\u2019s feedback.

It fits in your hands like a glove. It has a great camera for a tablet you wouldn't believe the pictures I have taken with this thing I get a lot if compliments all the time. As for its competitors the samsung note 10.1 2014 edition, the structure of this ipad blows it away. Know Samsung has its own perks that Apple doesn't offer but I would still say its a fair superior product then the note.

Is it the best tablet for you?", "Author": "John Ryan", "ReviewID": "R99F4BEOZO0JF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The new iPad Air is Apple's latest, slimmest, lightest release of their hand-held computer. Oddly enough, it's so beautifully easy to use (my one year old daughter loves playing with it), it's almost doesn't feel like a computer at all.A word of warning - this review is written for people who've never owned an iPad before - and are wondering what all the fuss is about. If you're thinking of upgrading skip down to the \"What's great about the Air\" section below, or just buy it - it's amazing.Just what's all the fuss about?--------------------------------------I used to own a laptop for work, and (very occasionally), it'd sit on my lap on the sofa, and I'd use it for pleasure (eMail, watching films or playing the odd game). Then I bought my first iPad, and the laptop became redundant, a boring \"work device\". Hard to explain, but the fact the iPad is so small and light, and you navigate around with your finger by pointing and gently swiping the screen makes the whole experience a lot easier - a lot more fun.Even my most \"luddite\" of friends have been won over.It's incredibly simple and easy to use (it only has one main button), and everyone from my one year old daughter to my 85 year old dad have taken to without problems. It's size and shape also support using it like a book (literally to read a book or web page), but you can also watch TV and films.Personally I'm also paranoid about my password getting \"hacked\", and someone running up a huge Amazon bill or buying stuff with my credit card on eBay. Well one of the benefits of the iPad (and iPhone) is it's \"almost impossible\" to get a virus - one of the most common ways to get hacked. This doesn't mean you shouldn't use strong passwords, (both Sony and Adobe got hacked), but it's reassuring to leave the Windows world behind.Finally, I love the way these devices (iPad, iPhone, Apple TV, Apple Mac), increasingly work together. The fact you can start a Pages document on your Mac and edit it on your iPad, or take photos on the iPhone, and in seconds see them on the iPad or Mac and display them on the Apple TV.The thing is, \"it just works\".What would you use if for?----------------------------------* Shopping online. Obviously - you could be reading a review on Amazon about the iPad Air!* Reading web pages. As you can hold it like a book it's great to read the news online (my wife loves the Daily Mail Online).* Reading Books. It's great for reading books from Amazon Kindle or Apple Books with the benefit of 1,000s of online book reviews* Navigating web pages. Instead of clicking with a mouse, you gently swipe your fingers on screen to scroll around* Watching Films. I use it to watch Netflix online videos (with an Apple TV you can send stuff to the telly)* Watching TV. With the free BBC iPlayer app you can catch up or download BBC programs* Reading and replying to mail. I use \"mailbox\" a great free app to read and reply to mails, but there's a free one included* Showing and organising photos. Any photos on an iPhone are automatically available within minutes in \"the cloud\"* Playing games. From fun puzzle games like \"Cut the Rope\" to fully fledged first person shooters.* Listening to the Radio. With \"Tune in Radio\" you can listen to thousands of radio stations world-wide.* Listening to music. I stream mine to an Apple TV, but you can also buy portable speakers or just plug into the AUX socket* Editing Word, Excel and Powerpoint documents using FREE App \"QuickOffice\" (owned and supported by Google).* Editing Pages, Numbers and Keynote documents (Office for the Apple) on the FREE Apple apps.* The list goes on and on.Update: You can edit Word, Excel and Powerpoint documents (plus Pages, Numbers and Keynote) on the iPad (although I'd recommend an external keyboard - see below). It's definately powerful enough, although I'd not expect these apps to cope with REALLY complex document layouts. Great for general letter and document writing though.Which model should I buy?----------------------------------I can't comment about Android tablets (apart from the Google Nexus 7 which is well regarded), but in terms of the Apple tablet line-up in order of cost:-1. Avoid the Apple iPad 2, it's a relatively old model, under-powered and with a lower resolution screen. If you really want an Apple but don't want to spend the cash, buy a 16g WIFI 3rd or 4th generation iPad from eBay. Avoid this one.2. iPad mini is a lovely tablet. A 7.9 inch screen and astonishingly light and remarkably thin - it feels like a light-weight book.3. iPad mini with retina screen. Again 7.9 inch screen, but with the blazingly fast A7 chip and a \"retina\" (high definition) screen. Worth the upgrade if you can afford it.4. iPad Air. Much larger screen size (9.7 inches - doesn't sound much but it makes a huge difference). Same fast (A7) chip as the Mini with Retina - the latest and fastest iPad available.Clearly (from my viewpoint) there's only really three options. The iPad Mini, the Mini with retina screen and Air.What are the Optional add-ons?-----------------------------------------Well, assuming you've dropped by the Apple Store or John Lewis (which I would highly recommend), and handled the iPad Mini (with/without retina screen), and iPad Air then your options are around memory size and cellular option.Memory: Once bought, you can't add memory (space for apps, films, books etc). However, the basic price goes up a huge amount (+\u00a380 for the 16g to 32g iPad Air). But, having owned a 16g and then a 32g iPad - I can safely recommend the 16g unless you really want to store a huge amount of videos and downloads. Only you can decide, and if you're lucky enough that money is no object then splash out. Otherwise, 16g should be fine for most people.Celular: Allows you to connect to the internet while you're out and about. This will add an additional +\u00a3100 to the price and means you can slip in a mobile phone SIM card. This means (for an additional \u00a37-15 a month extra), you can access the internet on the move. Alternatively, you can opt for the WIFI option, and use it at home or at at \"hot spot\" (eg. Starbucks, most rail stations and hotels etc).Personally I'd buy (and indeed did), the 16Gb iPad Air WIFI.Do I need anything else?-------------------------------Most people (me included) buy a cover. Apple (and now several copy-cats) make a \"smart-cover\" which automatically shuts down the iPad when you close it, and switches it on when you open it. There's versions which cover the back, or just the screen. Apple charge from \u00a335 to \u00a365 for their (admittedly) high quality fabric or leather covers, but there's many available from \u00a310. Be aware, you do get what you pay for.Personally,I think it's a pity to cover the beautiful aluminium industrial design of the iPad with a cover - but if you've spent hundreds of pounds you'll want to protect it from scrapes and bangs.I also invested in a keyboard (\u00a325-80), as I tend to write a lot of mails and documents (remember it comes with a word processor). I'd recommend the Logitech Ultra Thin iPad Air Case with Keyboard - Space Greyand the ZAGG Keys iPad Air Case Folio with Backlit Keyboard - Black although these are strictly optional unless you want to use your iPad as a proper laptop.Finally, if you have another Apple device (eg. an iPhone, Apple TV or Mac) you'll find these work together beautifully. For example, you can create a reminder on your iPad and it appears on your iPhone. Equally, photos taken on your iPhone appear on your iPad, and you can stream music or videos from iPad, iPhone or Mac to an Apple TV.Some people think this \"locks you in\" - but it's your choice.What's great about the Air?-----------------------------------* Lighter (30%) and thinner than the previous version (469g from 650g)* Even faster A7 chip. Blazingly fast!* Improved sound (compared to the iPad 4)* Software including+ iMovie - edit and publish home made movies+ Numbers - Fully functional Excel for the iPad+ Pages - Word processor+ GarageBand - Play a piano or a drum kit+ iPhoto - Edit and organise your photosWhat's not so great?--------------------------* The change in physical size means you'll need a new keyboard or replacement cover if you're upgrading* Pity Apple didn't include the \"touch ID\" to secure your passwordsOverall Opinion---------------------It's hard to believe the iPad version 1 was released just four years ago, and there's a huge raft of \"me too\" tablet computers to choose from, but the Apple iPad Air is still the one to beat. As \"Which?\" magazine (in the UK) put it - \"...the best tablet we've ever tested. Apple packs a beautiful screen and lightning fast processor into a slimmer-than-ever shell, and battery life is very impressive\".Yes, there are cheaper Android based alternatives, but the quality, design and beauty of this tablet just sets it apart. If it were a car it'd be a top of the range Mercedes or a BMW.Highly Recommended.", "Date": "February 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Apple does it again", "Author": "Robert Garner", "ReviewID": "R2A8NVDAH0DGG5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is not my first iPad.

At 467g the Air redefines computer portability and is so lightweight it's hard to tell whether you're carrying it in your bag or have in fact forgotten it, without looking to check. The Air has a fast A7 chip and the screen is a useful 9.7 inches; it's a breeze to use. The design of the graphics is so intuitive that any child or technophobe can master it and feel at home in a few minutes, which makes it the perfect entry-point into IT for someone who has so far avoided computers.One of the clever things Apple have done is the creation of the individual `Apple ID' which means once you enter your ID & password your iPad, iPhone, iPod and Mac immediately share all their files, and everything you created or stored on one device becomes available on them all: photos, music, reminders, address book, documents are all shared. This is probably the most brilliant idea ever in the IT mass market to create brand loyalty among consumers and `locks you in to the corporation for the duration'.Now, the bad news: the software crashes from time to time necessitating a reboot, which is annoying and inconvenient. This fault is acknowledged by Apple, as the software has a few bugs. Also the wireless reception is not all it might be, as it sometimes (mysteriously) fails to connect to even a moderately strong signal.Apple's pricing structure does not reflect the cost of manufacture but is driven by a market segmentation strategy, so the price really cranks up if you want an iPad with more memory or which can use the GSM phone network. The best value is the 16G Air without Cellular, which only connects to the internet via WiFi. 16G is a lot of memory by the historic standards of portable computers and you'll only find it insufficient if you want to store a lot of big files like films or powerpoint presentations.You'll need a carrying case to protect it (scores of different designs are available) and maybe a keyboard, which if you're doing a lot of writing and document creation rather than just surfing the internet is the one essential accessory, as without a separate keyboard the usable screen area is reduced in size. Around one million downloadable apps for Apple devices means you can personalize your iPad and make it into more or less whatever you want. The Air design is aesthetically a work of beauty in its simplicity, cleanness of lines and proportion, and despite some irritating niggles is a pleasure to own and use.", "Date": "January 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Don't buy from Worldwide Distributors!!!

It's tv quality display unlike the laptop or regular computer screen that is not visible if you are standing off to the side or too far away.I still hate touch screen tablets preferring the keyboard control of laptops but I have no regrets about this family purchase.  It does load internet pages faster and it does have the best display I have ever seen (but we are not a high tech wares household).  You can see the images from different angles from distances unlike how you need to position yourself to view a laptop screen.  So basically the high price can be somewhat justified in that for the price of a really good laptop - you can get a tv quality screen.  If the iphone had come out with a bigger screen like the Samsung Galaxy Note 3, I wouldn't have supported the purchase of this device and I would have been wrong about that but my brother has been sick and this makes him happy every day when he holds it - he smiles to himself.  After a few weeks of holding it carefully in a plastic bag!, we finally got the nearest perfect case for it: the i-Blason Apple iPad Air / iPad 5 ArmorBox Kido Series Light Weight Super Protection Convertable Stand Cover Case (Black).  I wanted the Speck handyshell of the Tylt stand but I as wrong.  The iblason folds under making it sturdier and better especially on a bed.We have screen protectors on front and back because this looks like the iphone 5s in that it is prone to scratches.We went with 64 gb after deciding on the 32 gb because nevermind Apple's profit margins, it was worth a hundred dollars more to prolong the life of this device.  Hopefully, this will be the only ipad we ever own.  We know people who still have their one and only ipad 2.This is another nonremovable battery so don't overcharge it.  You need to break out the included adapter because it's designed to be powerful enough to charge this ipad.  Iphone adapters will probably give you the message that the device is \"not charging\" after lighting up for a few seconds with the charging symbol when you first plug it in.It is thin but it is like a hard wafer - so it still FEELS thick in some ways - but it turns out one pound FEELS heavy to us so we didn't mind putting a fat case on it and ruin the thinness of it.  For the first few weeks without a cover, it didn't feel like that comfortable in the hand but then neither did the iphone 5s without a case.Holding something thin like the Air or the 5S does not make the device feel grounded but I definitely do not prefer the ungrabbability of the laptop - it is always a chore to haul a laptop.I don't doubt after living with the Air that Apple will be putting out much bigger Ipads in the future - it's the grab and go quality that is the selling point and we need bigger screens - this will then cut into Roku's competitiveness because Apple WILL put out an Ipad that is just large enough to make owning a tv set nonessential - it just needs to be bigger enough to be a few feet from the eyes.  Apple TV has real competition in the Roku but a bigger Ipad would not only be a laptop killer but it could make flat screen tvs less important.***********you can stop reading if you just need to decide if this is a good device - it is.  It also happens to be exponentially more expensive than Android and Windows tablets.The Apple walled garden feels BIG - it doesn't feel like the Android one which makes you feel like you went the a la carte route - you got a removable battery and removable memory with your device and you're feeling clever about saving money but the trade off is that you always have to scramble and you are NEVER SURE that you got everything covered (think of Apple as frustrating and expensive American citizenship as opposed to being a citizen of the European Union - Apple SUX!)  Android is missing apps and you notice when shopping at apps that it doesn't feel like the Apple App Store on the device - it doesn't feel like you have almost internet-size reach within the Apple universe.  It doesn't give you the feeling that you are receiving the goods first.  Android updates can be wonky and there is no accountability there - Samsung just apologizes if bad code screws up their phones that you now own and those updates with the unappetizing names that only sound good in theory but are all frankly, DREADFUL foods are never guaranteed for your particular device.  It feels like there is no recourse, no genius bar, nothing if there is malware or some other software problem.I'm not happy at all with Apple because of the nonremovable battery and the tough luck attitude if you plunk down way too much money BUT I can't trust the Android products at all BY THEIR VERY NATURE.  Google themselves won't refund their own branded devices after 14 days.  Am I supposed to head out to their California headquarters and beg for some customer service?  It doesn't matter if Apple stores don't make the majority of the sales  - they indicate a commitment to the customer.I'm always afraid Samsung is going to fold when it is no longer profitable for them - chaebols do do that.  I honestly don't think Google and Motorola are seriously interested in taking away from the Appleverse.  The Appleverse is the alternative, the break time from working on Microsoft computers.I would think the Android devices after they stopped getting updates would be as useful as the gameboy or nintendo ds toys in the back of the drawer somewhere.I'm not an Apple fan but I don't think Android has a shot despite offering removable batteries and memory sometimes which are extremely important especially for work-related data.*****************************The Apple Store lets you buy gift cards or coinstar receipts to pay.  Sony wants your credit card information even after they \"got\" hacked and released all the credit card information of its accounts.  Microsoft is only slightly better.  It's arrogant to force us to lose our financial privacy and security to access a device that we paid for.****************Who do you want to have access to too much of your personal information?I don't want ANY Of my stuff on ANY cloud especially if it is work related.  The internet-enabled devices are getting way more myserious, inaccessible and way slicker in the way they are not providing a description of what they do, how they do it, what is entailed, etc.  It's all ... hazy like a CLOUD.The internet access and the access of the apps to the owner's information makes me very uncomfortable which is why I see this as an entertainment device and not a work one  - it is impossible to look under the hood and control this thing - it takes the user for the ride - we are NOT in the driver's seat with these devices but that is also another reason to go American (that means Windows, Android Motorola/Google or Apple) and Apple and Windows are the ones with more closed systems but they're not perfectly secure.I think Siri indicates that not only are they recording our voices but they digitized them and broke down our voices into code not for recognizing our COMMANDS - but that means Siri could probably say something you never uttered in your voice.  The touchscreen could have been a fingerprint collector all along and the camera - well, I'm sure it is always on.**************Apple's litigation against Samsung is big news this week and if Samsung has been allowed to make money (it may be the only competitor who has something to show for its efforts) then it may have been in on it which means it can shut off the lights on their android devices and just sell big appliances because Apple's legal wins have huge implications.  It let competitors (usually foreign) copy (mostly for android - the name \"android\" doesn't really invite confidence thanks to Blade Runner and I, Robot) and if Apple is now suing Samsung successfully for copying - that means Apple didn't strike until there was something they could get back financially and it also means that Apple can damage you enough so that all your years of efforts will be for naught.  Those sunk costs - that's the poison.So I wonder - what if Apple sues in the home countries - the ban is for Samsung sold in the US.  What would Korean courts do about a lawsuit by Apple in Korea?  Does that make Sony Experias vulnerable in Japan?  What about Nokia now owned by Microsoft in Finland and in Italy one of Nokia's strongest markets?  What about the touchpad controller on the Playstation 4?Three days from the anniversary of the Pearl Harbor Attack, Comedy Central is reairing South Park episodes on 12/4/13 in this order:HumancentiPad - not only about the actual war crimes committed upon civilians and POWs by Mengele and Unit 731 but also about Apple's originality AND their dominant attitude towards their rightsfollowed byA Song of Ass and Fire which reiterates the claim made in Black Friday that the selling point of the Playstation 4 is the touchpad interface.Apple can pull the litigation trigger at ANY TIME and because they already won with Samsung, Sony's attorneys are not going to be able to drag out much of the issues of the lawsuit so that the Playstation 4 can sell for as many years as its predecessors.Holy Moses.", "Date": "November 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Expensive but built cheap.", "Author": "Timothy M.
