[...]For those who are looking at getting the best tablet out there at the moment, this is the one you should be looking at.My profile: Heavy tablet users for personal and business purposes.  I work on my tablet around 4-5 hours a day (Email / Documents / Spreadsheet / PDF ) and use it 1-2 hours for personal use such as watching movies or reading books/magazine.  Tablet is my go-to device for all internet related search I do.I have the following and/or used the following before:1) iPad 12) iPad 23) iPad 44) iPad Mini5) Kindle Fire6) Kindle Fire HD7) Kindle Fire HD 8.98) Asus Transformer with Keyboard9) Nexus 7 First Gen10) iPad Air 16gb WifiAs you can see, I been through many devices and hope this review with my experience helps users decide if this is the right device for them. This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this next year.  For comparison sake, I will use last year's Kindle and iPad mini as they are the closest size to this HDX 7\"Speed (9/10):This is leaps and bounds faster than last year Kindle HD.  Last year Kindle struggles to go through any HD video content I put in.  This year's HDX able to play seamlessly all the HD 1080p contents I added.  It is incredible how much the 2.2Ghz quad processor improved vs last year's model Dual 1.2Ghz.Screen (9/10):This is the biggest improvement over last year's model.  The screen is in true HD 1080p (1920x1080).  This means any HD content I throw at it will view in its intended resolution.  The screen is crystal clear (much better than iPad mini) and the viewing angle is incredible.  I have this Kindle hanged in the middle of the car and at any seat it is view very clearly.  Last year's model was not as clear as this.  This is excellent for my minivan with my kids watching all the HD movies.  The brightness of the screen is also much brighter than last year's modelSound(8/10):The sound system in this Kindle Fire HDX is using Dolby Digital Plus with virtual 5.1 surround sound.  That gives this device a much better surround sound then previous generation's.Build (8/10):This HDX is more \"angular\" than last year's device.  It's slightly rougher to hold in the corners than last year's model due to sharper edges though I doubt any users will hold their tablet by their corners.  The device is noticeable lighter (395g for Kindle Fire HD vs 303g for Kindle Fire HDX).  This mean you can hold this for longer time without fatigue.The power and volume button placement on this Kindle Fire HDX is interesting.  It is behind the device which allows it to hide away from front view.  However, this can cause user to accidentally hit the on/off button or the volume button when not being careful.  Aesthetically it is great but it is definitely not a practical solution when you are trying to use this on the go.It does look sturdy enough to survive minor drop but I highly recommend getting a case for it.  Those sharp corners seems more prone to dents than round corners for last year's model.Battery (6/10):This is probably the biggest drawback for this device.  The battery life is not as good as last year's model.  This is quite logical as last year's HD has a 4400mAh battery while running 720p while this HDX runs Full HD 1080p but runs only on a 4500mAh battery (only 100mAh more than last year).  The 1080p screen pulls a lot of power vs last year's model when the screen is on, especially when running HD videos.  I'm able to achieve 5 hours of heavy use compare to 7 hours for last year's Kindle Fire HD at medium brightness with Wi-fi on all the time.  I tend to bring around an external battery pack but prefer something that is integrated (like a battery case)Software & software compatibility (8/10):The amount of app is still lacking compare to App store or Play store but has been steadily increasing which is a great sign. Games and software boot time has increased noticeably and compatibility is not an issueSilk browser has definitely improved compare to last year's tablet with multiple tabs actually now usable on the HDX.  For last year's version, it is practically unusable after 2 tabs due to the lack of hardware resource on the tablet (especially when the website is not optimized for mobile use).  The HDX has no problem going through any webpages I throw at it.Hopefully more apps will be optimized to use quad core soon.  I'm guessing some of these apps are only optimized for last year's dual core.I haven't got the opportunity to use Mayday yet but will review about it once I get more update on this.Complimentary Accessories (3/10):For all smart devices, one of the most important time is the number of accessories available.  At launch, it is understandable the lack of accessories but productivity focus accessories such as integrated case/keyboard are missing at launch.  This is rather disappointing as it can be a powerful productivity device with the right accessories attached.  Also the lack of case selection is quite astonishing for a flagship product on Amazon.  Hope there will be more cases such as battery case (due to above battery problem) or rugged case come out soon.Price (9/10):I got the special offer model at 16Gb (lowest end model) and it is enough for me to use.  The special offer ads are not intrusive like last year's model and sometimes does reveal some items I want. Compare to the ipad mini, this is practically a steal.  For those with the Nexus 7, it is quite comparable in price.Conclusion in one sentence: Amazon's iPad mini killer (8.5/10)For people who are justifying if this is a good upgrade, I say YES to that.  The speed and screen difference alone is worth the upgrade.  The whole user experience just improve drastically with the HDX.It use to be, for Kindle Fire HD, you will trade low price for slow performance, stutter and lag.  It honestly makes you think twice if the price is really worth all that poor experience.For HDX, this is no longer the case.  You get both great price, great screen and great performance that surpasses iPad mini. To me, the HDX is seriously Amazon's iPad killer.  It really marks how well Amazon has done to make themselves a worthy competitor in the tablet market. I hope some software upgrade or battery pack can make this the ultimate road warrior!****************************Dec 23th 2013 - 2 months  update *********************************So I have been using between this HDX 7\" and the 8.9\" HDX.  I also been using an iPad Air 16Gb Wifi and here are some updates, particular on the negative points mentioned previously.App Store - not so refined still.  Downloading and Installing problem occursThe app store after 2 month is still a bit lacking.  There are some freebie deals during cyber monday which I jumped (who doesn't like free stuff?)but still nothing that either the Apple App store or Google Play don't have.  Amazon App store really needs some exclusive apps to become a \"must get\" device.Now comes the bad part - I tried to download Magic 2014 game (big fan of Magic the Gathering since teen) from the Amazon App Store and the HDX 7\" downloads this rather slowly.  In fact, I noticed that when it reaches 50% it drops back down to 30% and redownloads the package again!  Since I'm not in a rush I really have no issue with this re-download problem.  However, this can be problem to some people who have limited bandwidth per month and won't appreciate redownloading the same thing again 2 times (or more but I didn't catch that).Once it reaches 100%, the app store attempts to install the software.  It goes into \"Installing...\" state for a while (at least couple hours).  Knowing that there's something weird going on, I rebooted the HDX 7\".  Once I rebooted it, the software shows it was never downloaded!Perhaps there's some application specific problem with this game but this really shows a rather poor experience on the Amazon Kindle Fire HDX.  I would expect a brand new top of the line Kindle Fire HDX would have ironed out simple bugs such as this but clearly, the Amazon App Store have 2 things it needs to work on:1) If this is an application specific error, Amazon needs to proactively test this release on all their devices before allowing it on the Amazon App Store.  It's quite obvious if any Amazon App store guys have even tried to install this Magic 2014 game that it just won't install.  Literally half the reviews on the review complain about this2) For these buggy release, Amazon should proactively pull this application from the store - the experience that lead to all the hours of download and wasted bandwidth got the user nothing in the end.  I can imagine some users with capped bandwidth or using their cell data to download will be furious if they know an app less than 1Gb rack them couple Gb of download.App Store is a big part of Amazon's Kindle Fire ecosystem and poor experience such as this really deters client in continued use, especially when all Kindle Fire are locked down to Amazon software ecosystem.  When you cannot even use the Amazon software ecosystem, any excellent hardware that this machine has becomes inaccessible and worse of all, a waste of user time to figure out.Now most people may say this criticism is related to the game(in this case, Magic 2014).  I believe this is not the case.  The responsibility of Downloading and Installing of the Magic 2014 application belongs to the Amazon App Store (after all, it is Amazon App Store people who authorized this to be released in their store). I start to find all other game download and installation questionable and my own usage time in App store browsing and purchasing drops drastically.From the above download experience, I did attempt to find some help from Amazon.  Here is where the more problem arises.Mayday - speaking to rep reading off outdated troubleshooting guidesAfter noticing my Magic 2014 download is gone, I attempted to contact Amazon through the Mayday button.  It's really my first time using this function so I don't really have any prior experience in using it.My Mayday call was picked up by Hayley (if I recall).  You can see a big Amazon logo in the background beside the customer service rep and she looks pretty friendly.  I explained my situation with the App store problem to Hayley but it seems she wasn't able to help; therefore I got transfer to a \"Tech Advisor\".  This Tech Advisor can't be shown in the video camera and asks for my credentials.  She also made me explain the problem again which I explained to Hayley (I would have thought someone will note down my problem as I need to use couple mins to explain again).  She then pulls something that you expect from an Indian Call Center by asking me to disconnect my internet modem.  I find this rather funny as I mentioned this is a software specific problem with the installation and has nothing to do with my modem or Internet connection.  I also mentioned that I am running a server at home and pulling the modem disconnects it from the Internet which breaks other services I am running unintentionally.  She seems to be stuck so she forward me to another representative (which if I heard correctly, it is the app store support rep).Once I got connected to the 3rd rep, they ask me to check my tablet date and time (which is correct).  This rep later ask me to press on options that are not the screen.  I suspected this rep was reading off an old Fire OS troubleshooting guide as I recently updated the Fire OS system and that some options and buttons are changed.  Given the large amount of time spent and there's no resolution, I went to my iPad air and downloaded the game successfully in couple mins while still have Amazon on the Mayday call.  I informed the 3rd tech support of this and thank them for their time although there was no resolution in the end.I very much prefer having the game on my Kindle HDX as the 7\" is perfect to bring outside for quick game or two, but the amount of time spent on troubleshooting and resource wasted on this is honestly not worth my time.  I ended up having to play this game on the iPad Air larger screen but also paid for in app purchase because the game itself is very good.It's a good lesson to learn that the whole software user experience needs to be more streamline and fluid on the Kindle.  Amazon has done successfully in the physical good purchasing section of the kindle fire (in fact I spent thousands of dollars more on Amazon.com using the kindle fire than on PC and very satisfy with the results) and that if it can bring the same experience to the software app store just like the physical store, Amazon will have a winner here. I use my machine extensively for magazine reading / internet browsing but when it comes to app download, I currently have my doubts if it will be another bandwidth hog and a waste of time.Display - blue hue appears but not very apparentSome people ask if the blue hue appears on the edge.  I can notice this if I'm reading off a totally white page (like a ebook or magazine).  However it is not very noticeable and that your eyes will ignore it eventually.  After all, words or graphic don't appear on the edges of the screen.Battery life - Still needs work onAfter the OS update, there seems to be a slight improvement with the battery life.  However, still not enough for me to really go through the day without bringing an external battery charger pack along.  At the moment, I am still looking for a 2 in 1 case + battery solution but it is not available.  I hope this can be my daily driver but without the battery life, it may just be a brick by the afternoon.Purchasing on Amazon.com - becomes addictive (Could be good or bad for some people!)I realized my spending on Amazon went up considerable compare to last year thanks to this Kindle Fire HDX.  I will be browsing it online and have these items saved on screen, constantly reminding me to get it.  Amazon really done a good job at this and really met, if not, exceed their goal in getting users buying from kindle fire.  With last year fire, the browsing experience on Amazon.com was not nearly as fluid as this year's HDX.  This makes it hard to keep my attention and urge to buy.  For people who wants a good purchasing experience, this Kindle Fire HDX will surely provide that.  For ones who need to save money, you may want to get your finger off the buy button!My overall rating stays the same as Amazon keeps knocking off prices for these machines making it still the best bang for the buck.Apr 28 Update - Family Use----------------------------------------------Got my kids an extra Kindle Fire HDX 7\" for them to play with.  My HDX 7\" is still running well with all my Instant Video and newsstand subscription inside.Since my kids don't treat their new toys with much care, I went and got them and myself a zerolemon EVA Case on Amazon.  The case is useful for prevent dents and major falls on your Kindle.  Even with my Kindle, the top pantel where the speakers are started to peel off a bit (amazon used glue to assemble the speaker grille top panel).  Case works great for hiding some of the blemishes of the kindle fire hdx 7\"Overall still satisfied with my machine and frankly been the best bang for the buck tablet i ever have.As mentioned, I will update this review periodically.  Next time I will focus on physical wear and tear of the machine after couple more months and again on battery life (as all electronics have a diminishing battery duration throughout its course of use). [...] Thanks for reading!", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent 3rd-generation tablet that compares favorably to the competition", "Author": "NF", "ReviewID": "R2KVHBC7NMNOGU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the middle model of the three models that Amazon is shipping this year: the Kindle Fire HD, the Kindle Fire HDX (this tablet), and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\". This is the successor for last year's Kindle Fire HD but with an updated operating system and new features, a redesigned shell (with the power and volume control buttons more readily accessible), an absolutely amazing display, superb sound, an included power adapter, and the new Mayday feature. See http://www.amazon.com/review/RNH700DOM9WN3/ for my review of the Kindle Fire HD and http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YPITHVTYLCZT for my review of the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\".Update: Some users are reporting a bluish glow around the edges of the screen for the HDX. If you search on YouTube for HDX Blue Haze, you can find a video showing the issue. Amazon has updated their \"Learn More\" link with the following info:\"To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7\" at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20% improvement in power efficiency.\"\"As a result of using these blue LEDs, you may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. All displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy.\"If this is something that you think would bother you, I'd recommend taking a look at the YouTube video or taking a look at the HDX at a local Best Buy or office superstore. I've also uploaded a user image here of my HDX with a book loaded so that you can see the blue glow (http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B00DOPNO4M/).The Amazon tablets are primarily content consumption devices, best suited for connecting to the Amazon ecosystem, including videos, music, books, apps, and so on. With the free Prime trial subscription, you can check out the Prime Instant Video options and watch movies and shows at no charge for 30 days. For videos, music, and books, the Amazon selection is at or near the top of the list; for apps, much less so. 90% of the top 100 apps are available on Amazon.com, as well as 100,000 others, but that's only a small fraction of what is available with Google or Apple.It's not quite as bad as it sounds because, while the competition has ten times as many apps, most of those apps are, um ... how shall I put this ... less than stellar (look up Sturgeon's Law). If there are specific apps you need or want, you definitely should double-check before purchasing to make sure that they are available. The apps that will likely never become available on the Kindle Fire ecosystem are those apps that require Google services (i.e., anything that uses Google location services). One ameloriating factor is that it is possible to side-load most of the apps from the Google Play store onto an Amazon tablet and a web search on side-loading apps onto Kindle Fire will show dozens of websites with detailed instructions. If the app you are sideloading requires a Google service to work, though, it will not run on the Fire, even if you manage to successfully install it.Like the other Kindle Fire tablets, as well as the Apple iPad and the Google Nexus, the Kindle tablet line doesn't have a micro-SD slot, so the assumption is that you're consuming content from the cloud. This is fine when you're using your tablet with wifi; not so good when you're traveling and want to load up your tablet with content for the trip. If the latter is something you expect to do regularly, you might want to consider the 32GB or 64GB versions, or pay the additional price for the 4G version, which is available on the 7\" tablet for the first time. Also, if all of your content is on iTunes or on Google Play, you would have to side-load everything onto the tablet. As is true of Apple and Google tablets, there's no way to automatically connect to the cloud storage of the competition.Something new this year is the ability to download Prime Instant Videos. I verified that I can download Prime Instant Videos to my Kindle Fire HDX. However, that option is not available for all movies and TV shows. It looks like they had to get the permission of the studios and not all of them said yes. So, for example, I was able to download \"Casablanca\" but not able to download \"The Avengers\" even though both are part of the Prime Instant Video collection and both are available for free streaming.Update: Adding a bit from a reply in the comments: Amazon is clearly looking at the Enterprise market with this launch, at least based on the details they provide. They've added full accessibility support (required in order to get government contracts), will be bringing support for VPN and business printing, have a better email client with tighter integration to Exchange, and are including OfficeSuite for productivity. There are other productivity tools available in their app store, as well, although both Google and Apple, particularly the latter, have more options. When VPN support arrives, I'll definitely be taking a look, as it would be nice to not have to lug my laptop home every night.So how does this Kindle Fire HDX differ from the previous generation Kindle Fire HD?Display: 1920x1200 (323 ppi) vs 1280x800 (216 ppi). It's more than that, though, as the colors are richer, brighter, with better contrast. This display has been judged by many reviewers as the best in its class and I would have to agree. Amazon has also added technology to automatically adjust the contrast and brightness when viewing the tablet in bright sunlight. While there is definitely a noticeable improvement, this isn't what you need for reading on the beach. For that, you'll need an eInk reader like the Kindle Paperwhite.Sound: As far as I can tell, the sound is about the same. This was already one of the best-sounding tablets on the market, with Dolby stereo output and enough power to actually make it possible to listen to music or video without requiring headphones.Size and Weight: Noticeably lighter (10.7 oz vs. 13.9 oz) and noticeably smaller (7.3\" x 5.0\" x 0.35\" vs. 7.6\" x 5.4\" x 0.4\"). This is a comfortable tablet to hold one-handed, even for long periods of time.Processor: It's a *lot* faster (2.2GHz quad-core, top-of-the-line CPU, compared to 1.2GHz dual-core). This tablet is amazingly fast and smooth, with the fastest processor in its class. Every game I've tried on it has run smoothly, with no hesitations, slowdowns, or glitches. Scrolling through content is amazingly smooth and fast now, without the hesitations and occasional slowdowns of the previous generations.Build: A redesigned shell with power and volume control buttons that are easy to find! This is a solid build but the back of the shell is something of a fingerprint magnet. Since most of us will be buying a case to put the tablet in, that may not be an issue.Camera: If there is a difference between last year's camera and this year's, I'm not able to see it. It's a high-def camera suitable for video-conferencing or Skype. Like last year's model, there is no rear camera. If this is important to you, you'll need the 8.9\" version.HDMI Output: This is the one area where last year's model wins. Amazon has removed the HDMI out connector from its tablet line (but see the description above for details on how Amazon is providing a software solution for sharing your tablet screen on your television). No other tablet that I'm aware of has this functionality so if this is something you need, you should be able to purchase one of last year's models fairly cheaply.Battery Life: The same, at 11 hours. However, Amazon has added a special \"reading mode\" to the device, which they claim will extend the battery life to as much as 17 hours. I did not test this. For my own personal use, the battery life is adequate.Price: It's more expensive ($229 vs. $199) but this year they include a power adapter, which was a $20 extra last year, so the actual difference in price is $10. For what you're getting, that price increase is definitely justified.It has an updated OS and updated feature software (including the free unlimited Mayday customer support feature). The software updates include the ability to download some Prime Instant Videos to your device and watch them offline, enhanced accessibility, enhanced enterprise controls and features (so now it's better suited for office work), enhanced email client, enhanced parental controls, improved X-Ray features (now including lyrics for music, as well as additional information for both books and movies), integration with GoodReads (coming soon), and the like.Where I noticed the biggest difference was the home screen. The default view is still the carousel but if you swipe upward, you'll see a more traditional icon view. The \"Recommended for you\" display on the home screen is now smaller and much less obtrusive (and it can be turned off in the settings). Amazon has also added multi-tasking of a sort, where swiping up from the bottom of the screen while you're in an app shows you the 20 most-recently-used items from your home screen, so you can quickly switch from one app to another without returning to the home screen.There is also a left panel available on most screens (but not the home screen) and in some of the apps, with navigation links and settings to make it easier to navigate and control your tablet or to navigate within the app. If you tap the center of your display and then swipe left while you're reading a book, for example, you'll see a panel that shows you the table of contents, the About the Author link, the Sync to Furthest Page Read link, and so on.The Kindle FreeTime option and the parental controls are still among the best in the business. If you want a tablet for a child and want to control what they can access, how long they can use the tablet at any given time, and the like, Amazon has you covered.You can now also schedule \"Quiet Time\" on the tablet, where notification sounds and pop-up notifications are disabled, either on a temporary basis by simply pushing a button or on a scheduled basis. Frankly, I doubt I'll ever use this feature but if you're the type who likes to read or watch video until you fall asleep, it's kind of nice to be able to disable all sounds so that you don't get rudely awakened when, e.g., someone plays a new word in your Words with Friends game.Mayday: This is a huge gamble by Amazon and it will be interesting to see whether it pays off. This isn't a feature for a techie like me and I didn't use it (although I was sorely tempted). From the commercials, it's pretty amazing, particularly that you can get a live chat in a matter of a minute or less (Amazon's goal is something like 15 seconds, I believe, although I can't help wondering what will happen on Christmas Day!). If you're thinking of getting a tablet for a technophobe, the addition of this feature may make the Kindle Fire HDX your best choice.How does this tablet rank against the competition? There are really only two other tablets in its class currently: the Google Nexus 7 and the just-announced Apple iPad Mini with Retina Display.Display: All three devices have retina displays, with the 7\" HDX and the Nexus at 1920x1200 (323 ppi) and the 8\" iPad Mini at 2048x1536 (326 ppi). All three displays are stunning. Amazon claims that it has enhanced the ability to read the display in bright sunlight, something that's a problem for all such devices. While this wouldn't be my first choice to read by the pool (I'd pick the Paperwhite), I can testify that it is easier to view the display in bright sunlight than its predecessors.It's worth noting that the aspect ratio of the HDX and Nexus is 16:10 while the aspect ratio of the iPad Mini is 4:3. Where this matters is watching video. If you're watching an old television show, a 4:3 aspect ratio is fine. If you're watching a high-def movie, the 4:3 aspect ratio is going to leave large black bars on your screen and the video will be much more compressed than it would be on the HDX and Nexus. Apple chose to maintain backward compatibility with prior devices rather than moving up.Sound: The HDX has Dolby Digital Surround Sound; the Nexus has Frauenhofer Surround Sound; the iPad Mini has stereo sound. The iPad Mini also makes the same mistake that Amazon made in its first-generation tablet: putting both speakers on the same side (in this case, at the bottom of the tablet). If you're watching a video, you'll have the tablet turned sideways and the sound will all come from the same side. The HDX, in contrast, has the speakers placed perfectly for video watching.Networking: The HDX and the iPad Mini both have dual band, dual antenna (MIMO) Wi-Fi. The Nexus is dual band but not dual antenna. All things being equal, I would expect the Nexus to lag a bit behind the others in networking performance, particularly in areas where the connection is spotty.Size and Weight:HDX: 7.3\" x 5.0\" x 0.35\" and 10.7 oz.Nexus: 7.9\" x 4.5\" x 0.34\" and 10.24 oz.iPad Mini: 7.87\" x 5.3\" x 0.29\" and 11.68 oz.There's really nothing to choose from here. All three are small, thin, and light. The iPad Mini is the heaviest but it also has a slightly larger screen.Processor:HDX: 2.2 GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor, 2GB memoryNexus: 1.5GHz quad-core Snapdragon S4 Pro, 2GB memoryiPad Mini: 64-bit dual-core A7, 1GB memoryThe HDX and iPad come out ahead of the Nexus on processing power while the HDX and Nexus come out ahead of the iPad Mini on memory. The A7 is only a dual-core processor but according to some tech sites that have run benchmarks, it definitely holds its own against the quad-core Snapdragon. These are all pretty powerful tablets.Cameras: Both the Nexus and the iPad Mini have 1.2 MP front and 5MP rear cameras. The HDX only has a front-facing camera. If you expect to take pictures with your tablet, the HDX isn't for you.Battery Life: HDX = 11 hours (17 hours when reading); Nexus = 9 hours; iPad Mini = 10 hours. Amazon wins this one, particularly if you will be spending a lot of time reading.Expansion: None of them have a microSD slot; they all assume that you'll be using their respective cloud systems.Parental Controls: All of them have the basic parental controls that allow you to limit your child's access to content, purchases, the web, and so on. Amazon goes farther, though, with the Kindle Free Time and Kindle Free Time Unlimited options, the latter of which is an inexpensive subscription to a curated library of content. If you are buying a first tablet for a child, I'd choose the Kindle Fire HD. At only $139, it is significantly cheaper and it has all of the options that the HDX has.Enterprise: As soon as Amazon releases its update, it will add VPN and network printing support. I believe all of the tablets have basic enterprise capabilities, including that support and various office apps. For real productivity, though, personally I'd go with a laptop, not a tablet.Support: Amazon wins this category, hands down, with the new Mayday system. Apple comes in second, with Apple and Amazon usually taking top marks in any customer support survey. This is an area where Google does not shine.Price: The HDX and Nexus win this one, hands down. Both are priced at $229 vs. $399 for the new iPad Mini. Neither Google nor Amazon makes much, if any, money on their tablets; they're counting on you to purchase content from their respective stores.From my own perspective, there is no single clear winner, as each tablet has strengths and weaknesses. If you already have Amazon Prime, the HDX is a no-brainer, with the access to the Prime Instant Video and the Kindle Owners' Lending Library. If you're primarily buying a tablet to read with, Amazon wins there, as well, with the 17-hour battery life while reading and the best display for reading outdoors. If you want apps, Apple and Google both have far more choices. If you want to watch movies, I'd pick either the HDX or the Nexus, as Apple's aspect ratio and its lagging sound put it at the back of the pack. If price is a factor, then you should pick either the HDX or the Nexus.If you're heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem, i.e., you already own an iPhone or iPad and all of your content is on iTunes, the HDX really isn't the tablet for you. Similarly, if you love browsing Google Play for apps to play on your Samsung Galaxy phone, you're likely to be disappointed in the section available on Amazon (although, as I note above, most of the Google Play apps can be sideloaded onto the tablet). If you love your Google Now or Siri, neither of which will ever be available on Amazon, this isn't the tablet for you.The bottom line: This tablet is primarily intended as a viewport into Amazon content and Amazon services. If you have Amazon Prime and you have Amazon eBooks in your collection, this tablet is a no-brainer. The price is low, particularly for what you get, and it's a small, light, high-quality, high-powered, tablet with a stunning display and superb sound. This really is one of the top tablets in its class.Note: As others have noted, the tablet will update its software when you first turn it on and connect to wifi. Unlike some others, I had no trouble with this operation, no glitches or crashes. It took several minutes but the process ran smoothly, as did the tablet when everything was done.Update:Now that I have a Kindle Fire HD and a Kindle Fire HDX tablet, I'm in a little better position to talk about which one I'd recommend:You should get the Kindle Fire HDX if:- You're a techie who wants the latest and greatest, the best display, the fastest processor.- You need a camera for Skype or other video app.- You play graphics-intensive games (e.g., racing games).- The size and weight matter to you, even in such small increments as this.- You think you will need the Mayday technical support.You should get the Kindle Fire HD if:- Price is a factor. $90 cheaper is not an insignificant amount. This really is an excellent value for the money.- You want an inexpensive tablet for a child (and, for this case, the lack of a camera might well be a plus)- All you want is a basic tablet for reading books, playing music, watching the occasional video, playing Words with Friends, and the like. While the screen on the HD isn't as stunning as is it on the HDX, this is still a true HD screen and it is very good.I check back pretty regularly, so if you have a question, please feel free to ask and I'll do my best to answer it.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice Tablet with Sharp Display", "Author": "Michael Gallagher", "ReviewID": "R23F7ENQQQYOVN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "To sum up what I will tell you about in the details below, for $229 you are getting a good deal on a tablet computer - especially if you compare it to the $199 for last year's first-generation Fire HD and the $500 or more you can spend on a Wi-Fi version of the iPad. Overall, if you consider the price and the functionality I think this is a great tool / toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device: the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and the new HD Fire.  If you are a first-time tablet buyer, where price vs. value is a key consideration, or if you are looking for an affordable tablet for the kids, I'd recommend the \"regular\" Kindle Fire HD that is only $139.  If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of that one.My review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the Fire HDX to the original Fire HD as well as this year's model of the Fire HD, but also some of the features for a first-time user.Consistent with my experience with setup of this year's model of the Kindle Fire HD, setup took a long time: despite being a brand new product, the Fire HDX attempted to download and install several operating software updates.  Software updates on a Kindle are usually in the background, and it was annoying watching the crashes and manual reboots.  Consistent with the Fire HD, it crashed during setup, playing a song, watching a TV show, and reading a book.  It took a little over an hour to get this thing up and running without consistent crashes but after the final software update it has worked as expected without further issues.Screen Display / Video Playback:This version of the Fire has the absolute best screen display of any Fire model to date. Looking at the technical specs Amazon made some major changes in the display / resolution, and the picture appears more crisp: I compared the viewing experience watching with my standard test of the Fire devices over the past couple of years - don't laugh - the first episode of the Wonder Woman TV series from the 70's. The display on this Fire was one heck of a lot better in terms of sharpness than last year's model as well as this year's model of the Fire HD. For you technical folks out there, the display is 1,920 x 1,200 with 50% more pixels per inch than the Fire HD.Wi-Fi Connectivity:The initial Wi-Fi setup took some time as it wouldn't remember the password for my router after each software update / crash / reboot series.  After the final operating software update I mentioned above, however, it was fairly easy to connect to the Internet via Wi-Fi.My standard test for trying out new gadgets is to see how fast they run side-by-side with a known piece of equipment doing the same test at the best place of Wi-Fi in my house and the worst place where it drags. In this comparison, I had this HDX version of the Fire sitting next to last year's and this year's version of the HD Fire, as well as last year's 8.9\" HD Fire, Motorola RAZR smartphone, my iPad 2 (yes, the Kindle guy uses an iPad for work), and the first-generation 7\" Fire (the model from two years ago) all just using a Wi-Fi connection vs. cellular connectivity.My \"normal\" website test is to hit the mobile websites of FoxNews, CNN, my personalized Yahoo page, Google, and the Houston Chronicle. The ones that were usually slow on the other devices were faster on the HDX (Houston Chronicle and CNN), and for the other sites I couldn't tell a difference in speed at the location closest to my router. When I went to the slowest / worst reception location of my house, the speed did have a noticeable difference in the other devices as this one was a little bit faster than all but last year's model of the 7\" Kindle Fire HD; yes, it was also faster than this year's model of the Fire HD but I attribute the increase in speed to the dual antennas on the HDX.Sound / Music Playback:The two speakers are located in the back of the Kindle Fire in two not-noticeable ports: one on the top and one on the bottom. My test of this feature was cranking up Van Halen's Panama to maximum volume (I always want to see if it could really play the guitar licks), and I would alternate covering one speaker up over the other: you have true stereo sound with no degradation of the sound that makes you think you are about to blow the speaker.  The Dolby speakers sound nice and you do get to hear the bass.  However, I am still of the opinion the speakers aren't going to do very well being placed in the back as I am in the front: I want to be able to hear whatever I am listening to without really having to crank it up and disturbing someone else in the room (that's what happens when you start losing your hearing like I am).  While the cover for this version has not shipped yet - why aren't the covers released at the same time? - I imagine the sound quality might decrease with a cover in the back over the speakers.  The X-ray feature is pretty neat as it displays the lyrics on the screen if you are so inclined; if you are not, it is as simple as the tap of an icon to make the lyric feature go away.Email Setup:Consistent with previous versions of the Fire, email setup was very easy for my main Gmail account, both with the software came with the Fire but my primary use of an existing app called Enhanced Email I purchased here in the Amazon app store. I did setup the email app that came with the program with no problem - it took about a minute to setup my main Google account - and I was able to send and receive emails as well as synch my online calendar via Google's calendar and contacts. For those of you asking yourself why am I using the Enhanced Email program, the simple answer is like many of you I have more than one email account: you can quickly switch back and forth on the accounts with the tool. The lazy person in me appreciates that as I don't like getting out of the lazy chair once I'm settled in!New Tabs and Screen Layout:In addition to the normal tabs Amazon has continued to make tweaks with the look and feel to the overall display such as more things to scroll through to find what you are looking for in an easier manner. Interestingly, and consistent with my experiences with this year's model of the Fire HD, I purchased the one with special offers and the only ad I have seen so far is on the main screen saver vs. being overwhelmed with ads like last year's model.Reading Books:Turning pages is pretty darn easy - just tap the side of the screen to go to the next page or back a page, or you can swipe your finger across the screen to do the same.  Amazon did add the feature to see the book's description for books on your device like they have with the e-Ink Kindle (always an annoyance with last year's model), which is a plus as I can't remember what each book in my digital to-be-read pile is about; getting to the book description, requires several taps on the screen to eventually get to where you want to be.  If there is an easier way to do it, I can't find it and maybe I should be one of the first guys, ever, to crack open the electronic user's manual to figure it out (doubt it).  For those of you who have wondered, you still can't organize your books into categories unless you purchase a third-party app</a> here in the Amazon app store.BluetoothThere is a Bluetooth connection, and I did my usual test of this feature by taking it out to my car and having the Fire stream music through my car stereo. There were no delays or skips with the connection, and it paired up in about a minute. Just make sure you give it a device name so you can recognize it and be recognized.Camera:There is a camera on this model - it faces the front or toward the user / reader.  Focusing and taking a picture is pretty easy, and Amazon will by default store your pictures in the Cloud - which counts against your storage allotment.  I'd recommend turning that automatic storage feature off unless you are sure you want it, because if you go over the limit that will provide Amazon another opportunity to collect a monthly revenue stream from you.Charger:Unlike previous models of the Fire, this one DOES include a charger!  If you're scratching your head with that comment, in previous models you had to purchase a charger separately for $20 which always seemed kind of silly for Amazon to do.\"Mayday\" button:A new feature with this model, and not included on this year's \"regular\" model of the Fire, is the introduction of the \"Mayday\" button.  Basically, you can touch the button and a video screen will pop up and you can actually see - and talk to - a live customer service agent.  I haven't pressed the button yet to try it out, as I think I would feel pretty dumb: when they ask me how can they help, I don't want to say \"I just wanted to see if this works and just stopped by to say `hi' for purposes of this review.\"What I Wish it Had: a case that was ready to go and shipped when the Fire was ready (why are we waiting).  A case is very important in order to protect your investment.  Also, I'm interested to see how they try to not hurt the speaker's performance I mentioned above due to the speakers being in the back of the unit and hopefully not covered up with a case.Overall, at $229 for the 16GB of memory model ($309 for 64 GB of memory) I think this is a good deal for someone who really uses the video / apps feature. Kids will love it as they can read books, play games, watch TV and movies, and a whole lot of other things. Adults should like it for the exact same reasons, but while I try to minimize the amount of work-related stuff I do at home with the business apps that are available here in the Amazon App store and other places around the Internet I can also work on Excel and Word-compatible files when I have to without having to fire up my work laptop or whatever the case may be. If you've never owned a tablet before, or are looking to upgrade from an earlier model Fire, I would recommend this one if video and apps are your thing - but make sure you purchase the higher memory one vs. the minimum 16 GB.  If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, or looking for a tablet for your younger children, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of last year's model or get this year's model of the Kindle Fire HD at $139.", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing Performance Worthy of Upgrade", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Goode & Eiffel\"", "ReviewID": "R3IO1X1FKICIE8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Netflix Issue:When I first got the KFHDX, I had no problems with Netflix.

If you already enjoy the Amazon ecosystem, crave responsively fast performance, love gorgeous high resolution screens, wish the Kindle Fire were noticeably lighter, all without sacrificing battery life, while being able to enjoy more benefits of Amazon Prime, plus many other great new features, then stop reading, save time, and hit the \"Add To Cart\" button and buy it.I wanted the Amazon ecosystem. I am a Prime member. I also own a Nexus phone, the Sony Xperia Tablet Z, and a few other Android devices, besides the original Kindle Fire. I don't mind that Kindle Fires don't have Google Play. I have other devices for that. My wife has the iPad 4.If this is going to be your only Android device, then the decision point is which do you prefer, the Google experience or Amazon experience? You can get most of the Amazon experience with a more conventional Android device.  The overlap is not as great going the other way around. However, with the new Fire OS, you do get a few more Amazon exclusive experiences. Weigh your needs and wants to make the best choice.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**SERVICE: Amazon service applies directly to this device since it is their product. Amazon had a one day only FAA 15% off sale for some of the Kindles. I opened up the MayDay and asked the rep if they would honor the discount to those who had previously made the purchase. I was told it would only apply for those who had made the purchase within the last 7 days. That was not me. The MayDay rep didn't really do anything wrong, but she just appeared as if she didn't care and seemed a little annoyed at my request. Because the customer CAN see the MayDay rep, in my mind, it would be very important that person have a smile and warm demeanor. I've done tech support for a business I once owned, and a simple thing like this can make a huge difference in how a customer perceives a company.I had also emailed Amazon, received a reply with a number, and gave that a call. The initial rep was kind enough to refer me to someone who could make that decision. The manager I spoke with made the decision to honor a partial refund, even though the 64GB model I had purchased was not one of the sale items. I didn't get the full 15%, but it was about 12% discount. I thought this was more than fair and I appreciated the fact that Amazon allows their service managers the freedom to make these kind of decision.I believe there were two factors in play. 1. My standing with Amazon as a shopper (not that they don't care about all their customers, but it's nice to be appreciated for being a loyal customer!) 2. I was still within my return window. I could have sent it back, bought the sale version and still come out ahead, in theory. It would have been a headache and extra cost for all involved, and this service manager was keen enough to save us all that headache. Even if I had to go that way, it's still great service that I could return the device this long after the purchase, for any reason.If I could make one request, it would be that there was a dedicated link within Amazon Shop for writing reviews. I find typing to be one of the more accurate experiences on the Fire HDX, much improved over original Fire, and would like to be able to write reviews straight from the new Fire HDX.After about 1.5 months use, I have no buyer's remorse. This is a great tablet and a great buy for Amazon fans.====================FIRST IMPRESSIONS====================The packaging, for those of you who care, was like looking at movie poster. It got you interested, excited and ready to open it up. Once the cover was opened, box unsealed, and then opened, the inside was simple and elegant. Inside is the Kindle Fire HDX, the 5 watt charger (not 9 watt), and a nice thick 5 foot long USB to micro-USB cord. That's it.Compared to the original Kindle Fire, the HDX 7\" is noticeably lighter and easier to hold. The angled edge harmoniously eases the hand into a comfortable holding position. This is great to hold! When holding landscape mode, the top, where the speakers are, is smooth glossy plastic. It attracts fingerprints but it actually adds to the grip. The Amazon logo that is recessed in the back is also this same gloss and also helps make the device less slippery to hold. Well done. Fortunately, those are the only places that are glossy plastic.Turning on the device, Amazon already had associated the device with my account. The carousel was familiar. But swipe up and there was the typical icon view.Overall, the device is snappy and responsive. No more lag. I love it! The screen is gorgeous. It rotates quickly from landscape to portrait. It's the best rotating screen I've experienced on any Android device so far, and I've had my share of Android devices.There are a myriad of new features to learn from the upgrade. So far, I like them - a lot. The Mojito OS does take some exploring to get fully adjusted. I'm still in that process after two hours of playing around.====================THE DETAILS====================-------------------------APPS (Added 2 DEC 2013):-------------------------One of the biggest CONS people mention about the Kindle Fire line is the lack of Google Play, which primarily means limited app choices. This is true. There are apps I wish I could get on the Kindle Fire HDX. For some this may be a deal killer. For me, it is not.Amazon has really gone above and beyond to make the lack of Google Play so much easier to take. Since I purchased the Kindle Fire HDX, it came with 500 Amazon coins. Within the Amazon Apps world, this translates to $5.00 to spend on any app. In the month plus I've been an owner, Amazon has offered a ton of free apps, good ones! In some cases, they offered a free app, plus more free coins. There seems to be no shortage of ways to get free coins. Even when I do spend the coins (and not my real money yet,) I've made a handful of purchases where I got more coins back, in one case, 250 coins just for making my first purchase using coins. Some of these deals equate to discounts of 30% or more.My new Kindle Fire HDX is loaded with games and apps I'd likely not have purchased on my own. Between this give-a-way fest and their daily free apps, I have a lot of great choices for full paid apps. Not all the daily free apps are very good, but some are. It's worth checking out, especially during this Thanksgiving/Christmas time period.The Kindle Fire is meant for consumption and Amazon has done a great job making sure I can do just that without breaking the bank. Amazon makes up for its shortcoming in the apps department by being far more generous than Google is with their store.With the current Cyber Monday sale, the Kindle Fire HDX is a steal! Let me reinforce that the Snapdragon 800 processor/Adreno 330 combo is one awesome setup! It makes apps like Minecraft, RipTide 2 and others look gorgeous and perform without hiccup. It's no small deal that the top of the line hardware can be had for bargain hunter prices.----------TURN IT ON:----------The power button is on the left back side. It does take a moment to figure this out when being used to a button on the top or side has been the norm for so long. It's not a big deal, but surprising after forgetting for the first time.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**I still find the button on back to be somewhat clumsy. Even though the other side has two recessed buttons for the volume, it doesn't stand out enough for me. I'm still flipping the device back and forth at night with little or no light. Even in the day time or with light, I have to make a concerted effort to determine which way is up and remember that the power button is on the left. With my other devices, I just feel for the button and push.-----------------------------DOWNLOAD PRIME VIDEOS:-----------------------------This is the main reason I purchased the 64 GB WiFi version. First, I could take videos with me when I had no internet connection, such as in a car. Second, when my kids want to watch videos, I can download their favorites so they won't be hogging the bandwidth at home!How does this work? Go to the videos, choose the desired video and an option to download will be there. My first attempt to download a Prime video, I chose Downtown Abbey Season 3, Episode 1, which was 1:06 hours long. I was given three options: Standard Definition, 720P HD and 1080 HD. I selected the 1080P HD option first.My internet is 10 Mb/s DSL download speeds. I made it to about 44% downloaded after about 50 minutes. Of course, I kept on checking out other features during the wait. While trying to start Flick Soccer, the device locked up on me. I was stuck. I held the power button for a good while and it rebooted.The HDX then successfully upgraded the system, something that failed after my initial setup. Yes, an update already (for the Mayday button!) When I looked to see if the video was there, it was not. I had to start all over again. It didn't save.This time, I chose 720P HD. It took about 19 minutes to download. I was previously able to view the 1080P video while it was downloading. It looked awesome. The 720P HD looked just about as good. Some action scenes, I could tell it was lower quality, but not that noticeable. This 1:06 hour 720P HD video file consumed 1.24 GBs of space.Next I tried the SD, or lowest quality option and downloaded Episode 2. This took 5 minutes and 44 seconds. The SD video file size for a 1:06 episode was 267MB. The video was a tad blurry, more choppy during action, and more noise, grain and artifacts. However, for standard definition, it was surprisingly passable. Download your young kid's videos in SD and save some space. They won't care, and even you may not.Finally, I retried the 1080P video with Episode 3. This time, it took 44 minutes 38 seconds to successfully download. The quality, as mentioned before, was excellent. The colors were vibrant, the video sharp and fluid. It took up 2.07GBs of space.Here is the rundown. About 1 hour video episode of Downtown Abbey. 10 Mb/s DSL download speed.SD = 5:44 minutes to download. 267MB. Quite decent quality.720P = 19:12 minutes to download. 1.24GB. Very good quality.1080P = 44:38 minutes to download. 2.07 GB. Excellent quality.For those who are new to the Amazon world, yes, you can download the Netflix app and watch those, too, minus the download for later option.**UPDATE 23 OCT 2013**:Yes, there are 3 quality settings for downloading Prime Videos. After digging around, I found a few more choices.After swiping down system menu in the Home screen, go to:Settings / Applications / VideosHere you will see individual settings for HD and SD downloads. It turns out HD has 3 quality settings and SD has 3 quality settings.  I chose to ask for each setting.Also, in this menu, you will find the option for Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 Audio. Because this increases the size of the video while streaming, it is turned OFF by default. I turned it on and it does make a noticeable difference with surround sound effect, both with speakers and headphones. The video you are watching will need to support this feature.In this Video settings, there is also the option to clear video search history.Another discovery with Prime Video downloads is that most videos do have a time limit for viewing offline. As long as you connect back online, it resets that time, so not a big deal in most cases. So far, I've noticed videos such as \"Under the Dome\" have a 48 hour limit offline before needing to reconnect. Other videos have a 30 day window. It seems as if some of the kids' videos had no such time limit for offline viewing.**UPDATE 2 DEC 2013**I am discovering that not all Prime videos can be downloaded. This seems to be true with a lot of newer Prime movies and some TV shows. I'm hoping it is a licensing issue and not a decision made by Amazon. If possible, please make ALL Prime videos downloadable!I also find the ability to browse videos to be tedious. Similar to Netflix, on the Kindle devices, Amazon pushes out choices to you in limited quantities. If your watching habits change on any given day, you will need to really dig into the menu choices to see all the viewing options out there. The menu choices overlap and can make browsing confusing, and a challenge to track what one has already browsed.In the Videos, in the side menu under \"Prime Instant Video\" there are three main choices:Top TV ShowsTop MoviesFor the KidsWhat tipped me off, is under \"For the Kids\" there are very few choices. I knew from my Roku device and from browsing from a web viewer, there had to be more choices for the kids.Regardless of which of the three main categories one chooses, each has a sub-menu found by tapping the little down arrow that is right of the category description, such as:MOVIES (Upper left hand corner once this choice has been selected)Top Movies, Prime (Right under, MOVIE, in smaller letters) and the arrow is just right of this.Each main category has sub-menu items, as noted before. But each sub-menu also has the same choices. These would be the same regardless of which main category one came from. Hence, this is where some confusion can come into play.What each sub-menu has, within each main Prime category, is an option called, \"Genres.\"  This is where one needs to go to find the rest of the Prime viewing choices. Unfortunately, there are even more sub-categories within each Genre choice. One will never find all the choices in one place for mass browsing.Are you confused? That is my point. Browsing could be less confusing and easier to navigate.For these two points within Prime Video, I'd knock off a half star. But since I can't, I'll leave my rating at 5 stars because overall, I'm still very happy with the device.----------AUDIO:----------I found the speakers to have decent sound. It sounds a tad more fuller than my Sony Xperia Tablet Z, but iPad 4 is still much better and sounds louder. The new HDX is sufficiently loud enough while holding it, but I do wish it could go a notch or two louder. With my Klipsch X10i head phones, the sound was plenty loud. It sounded better than the speakers and was OK. It won't win over Audiophiles, but good enough for entertainment purposes.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**In Settings/Device/Applications/Videos Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 Audio is shut off by default. Turn it on. It improves the sound, especially with the built in speakers. I can actually sense a better surround sound effect in videos that support this.I find that the speaker sound is actually pretty good the more I use it. There is more meat to the sound than I initially thought. For personal use, the loudness is good in a quiet environment. The sound quality is good for a tablet. The sound stage is narrow. The surround sound effect, once turned on is decent. The simulated surround effect is noticed most of the time.I still think the iPad 4 has the best built in speakers I've heard on a phone or tablet. I listened to the built in speakers on the new iPad Air, and the Kindle Fire HDX is much better. The iPad Air built in speakers takes a big step back compared to the iPad 4. The Air also has mono speakers and it really sounds mono, in a bad way.**UPDATE 2 DEC 2013**Rather than relying strictly on my memory, I went back and tested the audio side by side with my wife's iPad 4. I would say the sound quality is about the same. What I overlooked was the fact the iPad 4 only has one external speaker. It is mono. In that regards, I give the nod to the Kindle Fire HDX. With some surround effect, once turned on, the HDX separates itself even more. From my own testing, the built in speakers are one of the best on any tablet or phone. The more I use it this way, the more I am enjoying it. In most cases where disturbing others is not a concern, I don't feel compelled to need headphones. If one does need a little bit louder sound, hold it with both hands from the top, and the sound reflects directly to you, making it sound a little louder. The decision to put the speakers on top in landscape mode, was a very good one.----------GRAPHICS:----------The HDX has the latest and greatest Adreno graphics to compliment the current king of the hill quad-core Snapdragon 800 2.2GHz processor. Yes, it is a huge upgrade from the original Kindle. Huge!Playing the Temple Run games, I'd get frustrated with the lag on the original Kindle Fire. No more lag. Graphics look great. No video tearing.In Minecraft PE, the original Kindle can play it, but It's not a great experience. The HDX plays it with the best Androids out there. Once again, the beautiful screen and powerful graphics chip makes playing Minecraft a joy, even with Amazon's highly skinned version of Android running it.----------SCREEN:----------The screen is sharp. Texts are very crisp. Colors are accurate and beautiful. There are no pixels to be seen by my naked eye.One nice surprise is that the screen itself seems to be somewhat oliophobic. While fingerprints are there, they seem to disappear some. It is one of the better screens for this, at least that is my initial impression. I don't think this was even intended. I'll revisit this later with more time.The screen is glossy. It does reflect a lot. But once turned on, it can be noticeable, but also easily forgotten. If you are prone to glare and easily distracted by it, keep this in mind.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**After further use, I still think the Kindle Fire HDX screen is one of the best screens in terms of keeping it clean. It does collect finger oils, but I find it still keeps on cleaning off easier than any other device I've ever used. I don't even need a special cloth. Just by cleaning it off with the palm of my hands, the screen looks nearly clean again!----------MAYDAY:----------Yes, I tried it. I really had a question! No, really! I knew that while reading a book, the HDX could have its contrast adjusted for better reading in sunlight, as well as longer battery life. I looked everywhere how to get to this setting. I couldn't find it.I opened up the Mayday feature and waited about 30 seconds to connect. After confirming my email, address and name associated with my account, I was asked how they could help. With the speaker on full volume, I had a difficult time hearing the female tech, Celeste. I asked her my question and she did need to seek help to find the answer, but I got the answer. She was friendly. I could move the little window wherever I wanted. At one point, she took control of the screen.The answer was that the screen brightness setting had to be set to auto and it would then recognize when to make the adjustments while reading.It might seem a little daunting to do tech support via video conference. Don't worry. The video is one way. They don't ever see you. The tech can only see your screen.The Mayday button is added with the first initial system update, which should take place during the setup. But if it failed the first time like it did for me, you won't see it when swiping down for the settings on top of the screen. Manually update the Kindle by swiping down the top and finding it in the settings.I really don't see Mayday being a feature I'll need much, but it's a nice touch for the tech challenged.----------X-RAY:----------This could be one of the most underrated features. I didn't bat an eye about it before the purchase. Now, I think it is really useful and can see myself turning to it all the time.In movies, tap the video screen and X-Ray pops up on the left side. X-Ray detects which characters are in the current scene and you can find out more about the actor. Trivia facts are also there. It's like watching a DVD with narration on, only much less annoying and much smarter.In the Music player, X-Ray provides scrolling lyrics that follow the song as it goes. If you are a karaoke fan (I am not much so) then you will love this.Yes, even in some books, X-Ray is there. It provides footnote like data about characters and terms. I've only seen it in the book Les Miserable. There could be more. I'm guessing it depends on what the publisher provides.----------------SILK WEB BROWSER:----------------It's pretty fast for an Android tablet. On a tablet, I still find the Ipad 4 is the best experience with Safari. There is the option for mobile website, desktop version, or automatic. This is a bit misleading. I prefer desktop version of websites. However, with Silk, you won't get a real desktop experience. Silk still customizes the website to fit the HDX screen. The accuracy will depend on each website.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013***I find I don't use the Silk Browser much unless I need to quick look something up. I really wish the option to have a full desktop view did just that. On some of my sites, like Yahoo, it does a bad job of rendering pages. I may have to side load Chrome.---------------KINDLE FREETIME:---------------I just set up Kindle FreeTime. I did the Family Plan for up to 6 kid profiles for $6.99 a month. The other option is for one child for $2.99 a month.Once I set the age (but not actual birthdays, just close to their age) for each child, and subscribed to the unlimited family plan, I tried using it.It was a bit confusing at first. I wanted to set the content for each child. I couldn't find all these \"unlimited\" apps, books and videos for kids. I could only see what was already on my device or what I owned in the cloud.Only when I actually logged in as one of my kids, did I see all the kid's content I had subscribed. There were plenty of choices. The initial choices were for me to determine what I wanted my kids to be able to access that was for my main account. No, I don't want them to have access to all me and my wife's content. But yes, I do want them to have access to other apps and videos we already purchased. That was what the initial content filtering was all about.My first impression of Kindle FreeTime is that I may end up having to buy each kid their own Kindle. I can see them fighting over MY, I stress MY, Kindle HDX. I may never see it again once I let them on it. I think it's going to be that good. Thankfully, I can set time limits for them!**UPDATE 23 OCT 2013**:I could not download videos for offline use within FreeTime. That seems to be an Amazon Prime video benefit.Only certain books could be downloaded and viewed while offline.I did like that some books can be set to have a narrator read the books to the young child. This is good for my 3 year old. He loves the Thomas books that do this.------------BATTERY LIFE:------------The HDX came with about 60% charge. I'm making an educated guess since it was a graphic meter that is the default battery indicator. I changed it to show percentage after I'd used the Kindle for a short while. It had 54% by that time. After about 4.5 -5 hours of very heavy usage setting up, testing and downloading, I'm at the last 1%.After completely draining the battery to where it shut off by itself, here is what I've been able to measure for recharging with the standard 5 watt included charger, which does eat up 2 outlets on an older power strip:15% in 28:44 minutes30% in 1:00 hour40% in 1:22 hours50% in 1:42 hours60% in 2:03 hours70% in 2:21 hours90% in 3:05 hours95% in 3:15 hours100% in 3:34 hours Whew!Note: There is no indicator light to show charging status.**UPDATE 25 OCT 2013**:I let my kids use the new Kindle Fire HDX during a 4 hour trip to visit family. With some video, lots of multiplayer MineCraft use, it lasted from Noon to 9 PM with about 35% battery life left. It wasn't on all the time, but it was being used frequently.In a more detailed drain test, here are the results:5:41 Hours = 100% Brightness playing constant video (downloaded)9:28 Hours = 50% Brightness playing constant video (downloaded)During the 50% brightness test, it took 4:52 hours to drain down to 50% battery life. It took 4:36 minutes to drain from 50% down to 0% where it powered off on its own.50% brightness is still viewable even in a well lit room. However, I'd at least go 70%. In dimly lit areas with some light, 50% is plenty bright.The Kindle HDX is very efficient with power. It barely warms up and it never gets hot. The claimed rating of 11 hours with mixed use seems about right and that's using it constantly. With light to medium use, one could easily go a full day and likely two or three away from a power source.----------------------------HOW MUCH MEMORY SHOULD I GET:----------------------------The base model with 16GB memory is $229. To double that memory to 32GB costs another $40. Compared to Apple's memory upgrade practice, this is a cheap upgrade. To quadruple the base memory of 16GB to 64GB costs $80. This is the best value if you are going to upgrade the internal storage size. Here's why:$2.50 per GB to add 16GB storage to base model for a total of 32GB.$1.67 per GB to add 48GB storage to the base model for a total of 64GB.I got the 64GB model because I am a content lover. I love choice. I love freedom to use even when speedy internet is not available. I want to be able to download videos for my kids when travelling in the car. Even at home, I'd rather they view videos locally from a device so I don't have to fight bandwidth with them! Data these days can add up fast. 8 GB on original Kindle Fire was definitely not enough for me. The new HDX can't be upgraded later, so I did it now. 64 GB was the cheapest upgrade option per GB. Your reasons may vary, but maybe that will help you decide what's best for you just in case you haven't thought about a few of those points.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**If you want to save some money, the 32GB should be enough for most people. I consider myself a heavier user. I currently have about 17 episodes (most an hour episode) and 2 full length movies, all in 720P HD and I have 31.5GB space left. I haven't loaded my own videos yet, but that is something I plan on doing. I'm glad I got 64GB.For those of you that don't care about storing large files on the Kindle device, the 16GB should suffice. If you change your mind down the road, you'll need to buy a whole new device, so be sure of what you want. I will say that I'm glad 8GB option is gone. That just didn't cut it.If you are buying for kids, 16GB could be enough. Download videos in SD and it will save a lot of space and still be decent viewing quality. Also, with some diligence, simply delete content you've watched and you'll get that space back. If you can live without the convenience and willing to work at it a bit, 16GB is still a good choice. For kid use with SD video, the 32GB option will give you ample room for the convenience factor.-----------------------------------SPECIAL OFFERS OR NO SPECIAL OFFERS:-----------------------------------I opted to keep the special offers. Why? Because, they don't bother anyone. You'll only see them from time to time on the screen lock when you first turn the HDX on. Special Offers don't show up at any other time when you are using the device. If you like Gold Box deals, supposedly, some of these offers can be exclusive and even better deals. Why not? I'll save $15 for that. I think people make way too big a fuss over this. Spend that money on some apps, songs or other content. The fun you'll get from that will far outweigh the seeing a few ads that barely intrude on your life.----------PORTS:----------I have noticed that plugging in both the head phone jack and the micro-USB port requires going in at a slight angle. The angle matches the angled edges of the Kindle HDX. Don't force it in straight on! Be gentle at first until you get the feel of it.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013***After almost a month and a half, I find the micro-USB power port to remain a tight and secure fit. It's one of the most secure feeling connections I've felt for a micro-USB device. We'll see how it holds up after more time.----------------------KINDLE ONLY EXCLUSIVES:----------------------Try watching Amazon Prime videos from an Android device post ICS. Google doesn't support Adobe Flash in Android any more. I find it frustrating. I can watch Amazon Prime videos from my Kindle devices.I am one that does like to listen to my books while driving. You can't do this from the Kindle app on other Android devices. Text to speech only works on actual Kindle devices. I'm not sure if the text to speech voice changed with the Mojito OS, but I like the new voice better. It is still mechanical, but much better. My only gripe is that the text to speech shuts off if you manually turn a page and when screen rotates. Please change this! Let text to speech stop when I choose to stop it, especially when driving in a car.====================PARTING THOUGHTS====================The Kindle 7\" HDX is meant for consumption of content for Amazon lovers. It excels at this in almost every way, from hardware to software. If you love Amazon, absolutely get it. Navigating Amazon's skinned Android is simple and easy to use, but not meant for the tinkerer. It's definitely not Apple in design. But, it is functional. It knows what it is and the latest Kindle Fire HDX, to me, is even more exciting than the original. The improvements are that good.====================PROS & CONS====================PROS:o Top of the line hardware, super fast and responsiveo Gorgeous screen for both resolution and coloro Screen handles fingerprints very wello Lightweight and easy to holdo Download Prime Videoso Long battery lifeo Crisp text for readingo Great price for the hardwareo Kindle FreeTime for the kidso Parental controlso X-Ray provides useful information for video, music and bookso Kindle exclusive featureso Mayday offers free support and helpCONS:o Back power and volume buttons need getting used too Speakers sound OK, but could be a little loudero Text to speech in books stops with screen rotation or manual turn of pageo No rear camerao No HDMI out porto No GPSo No Google Play", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Blue/purple border on white pages!", "Author": "LindaFus \"lindafus\"", "ReviewID": "RXJ3VD36FN0O2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased my Kindle Fire HDX from Best Buy. After trying to read a book, I noticed a pretty bright blue/purple streak that never went away on the sides of the pages. Going into Sepia and changing the background pages did not help this issue.  I called Amazon and they replaced it with a new one. The new one has the same blue/purple border on white and light background pages. The Amazon replacement is more subtle and even around the edges, so I opted to return the one that had the darker boarder.I now see on Amazon's  description of the Kindle Fire HDX that they actually mention this defect as being normal and I quote below:----------------We want you to know...\"The Kindle Fire HDX 7\" has perfect color accuracy (100% sRGB), and we wanted to share more details around our display design decisions that helped us achieve this.You may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. All displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy. Most LCD displays use white LEDs, and then apply filters to extract the desired color. The result is oftentimes a compromise to tone and color accuracy, or--if attempting to address these compromises--an increase in battery consumption and, thus, device weight.We've taken a different approach. To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7\" at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20% improvement in power efficiency.\"---------------This glow is not light nor is it narrow.  The text of a book runs through this and it is very uncomfortable to read this way. This is also true for the Silk Web browser.  I will keep my Kindle Fire for a bit and see how this all pans out with Amazon.  Buyer beware:  Reading with this blue/purple glow is not the same as it is on your Kindle HD or older.After stating the above, I will say, other than this serious screen flaw, this device runs everything else flawlessly and I love streaming movies on this device. Netflix runs great as does Amazon Prime movies. Apps load instantly and web pages as well. This screen issue not so much. I am a bit confused as to why Amazon thinks this blue/purple haze is ok.  I will try to get used to it.", "Date": "October 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Most amazing device I've ever owned!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1NFRVWEUS01UH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm 64 years of age and a teacher. I am no techie, but really enjoy the electronic gadgets that are being invented these days. I preordered and purchased the very first generation Kindle 2 years ago and felt that it was time for an upgrade. This time, I waited a couple of days to see how it was received by the public and to catch a few of the early reviews before deciding to order. I'm sorry I waited. This tablet is AMAZING for my purposes! It is designed for media consumption and anyone who purchase it ought to be aware of it. It does a great job in that aspect.The \"purple haze\" a number of reviewers have complained about seems quite inobtrusive to me. I don't know that if I were not previously aware it would even be in the discussion. It is a very faint, but discernible border around thedevice when reading.  I haven't found it to be annoying at all and shouldn't be a deal-breaker.I use the device for reading of books and magazines, watching movies and television shows, playing games, e-mail and light surfing of the web. I'm even able to download my students' grades and attendance records from the school web site more rapidly than my hardwired computer in my workplace! The screen picture is more than outstanding...it is unbelievable! The keyboard appears when it is supposed to and is very responsive, just like the rest of the touch screen. And lest I forget the Mayday button, this whole concept is unreal, when I consider the time spent with most customer service outfits on the phone line waiting for my cal to be answered. Great job, AmazonDownloads of movies and games are quick. I have installed Netflix and Hulu Plus on the device and they work flawlessly with the device. As a Prime member as well, it works seamlessly. My digital subscriptions to several magazines were a snap to transfer to this device. All in all, my expectations were far exceeded by the product.The device is lightweight, beautiful and so cool I purchased an inexpensive ($4.95) case on line from Poetic that provides a lightweight shell and keeps the sleekness of the device intact, yet still allows me to prop it up for video viewing. It also puts the device in sleep mode when the cover is closed and the device immediately awakes when the cover is opened.While I understand the criticism, why buy the device if you knew it's limitations? It is the best at what it is supposed to do and the price when compared to other tablets on the market is a steal, if you consider what it is able to do (and not what it WASN'T supposed to do.In summation, if you are not a techie and just like to relax with a movie, read a book or magazine or play a game, start ordering your HDX now. Media doesn't have to cost you a fortune, is thousand of books I have ordered over the years have been free, and for a couple of hundred dollars a year I and my wife get all the video we want for all our devices from Prime, Netflix and Hulu +. It's the best toy I ever bought. Final rating: 9 out 0f 5!!!!!", "Date": "November 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best 7\" tablet on the market?", "Author": "J. Chambers", "ReviewID": "R3N1QB8TWW0WRJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "NOTE: This review is for the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" tablet with 32GB, special offers, and Wi-Fi only.I pre-ordered both the original Kindle Fire and the Kindle Fire HD 7\" tablets when they were first announced. It was love at first swipe. The second generation HD was a huge advance over the first generation, with the welcomed addition of an external volume control, an HDMI port, and higher screen resolution. The HDX is also a big step-up from its predecessor. The most obvious improvements:* Higher resolution - 1920x1200 (323 ppi) in the HDX versus 1280x800 (216 ppi) in the HD. That's a huge difference, especially when viewing HD videos. The HDX has a new graphics processor that Amazon says has 4X the performance of the HD.* Faster processor - a 2.2GHz quad-core Snapdragon processor in the HDX versus 1.5GHz dual-core processor in the HD. This is really advanced hardware for a tablet, putting the HDX at the high-performance end of the tablet market. Also, the HDX has 2GB of RAM, compared to the HD's 1GB.* Longer battery life - 11 hours (up to 17 hours in a \"reading mode\") for the HDX versus 10 hours for the HD.* Lighter weight - 10.7 ounces for the HDX versus 13.9 ounces for the HD. That's a noticeable difference when you're hand-holding the Fire. The weight reduction comes from a magnesium body covered with a rubbery material that's easy to grip. The shape is different, too, with beveled edges that help with hand-holding the HDX, since your fingers curl around it better. Also, the speakers have been moved from their position in the HD to the top of the beveled section (in the landscape orientation). This is a nice improvement from the HD, since your fingers won't cover the speakers in the HDX. And speaking of audio, X-Ray lyrics for my downloaded songs is a really cool feature. Really cool.* I like the new display. The display on the HD was the carousel filling most of the home page. This is still the default on the HDX, but swiping upward fills the screen with apps instead.* The power button and volume control have been moved. I hated the ones on the HD. They were hard to see and hard to find by feel. On the HDX, the concave buttons are on either side of the tablet when it's held in landscape position. It's not perfect, but I like it better.Those improvements alone make the HDX worth upgrading from the HD in my opinion. My biggest frustration with the HD was how the Silk browser was unresponsive sometimes, sitting there while I tapped a link several times. Occasionally, rebooting got the browser back on track, but it was frustrating. I've been using the HDX's browser for several hours, and it's been very smooth and responsive so far.I've already noticed a lot of fairly minor changes from the HD. For one, they've tweaked the virtual keyboard a bit. The most obvious change was to kill the long-press apostrophe from the period key. Now the apostrophe is on the numerical keyboard. It's not a big deal, it just takes some getting used to. Also, from some of the first reviews of the HDX that I read, some users are complaining about a purple border around web pages. To be honest, I barely noticed it. It's a very light purple about a tenth of an inch wide on my HDX. I don't know why it's there, but it doesn't bother me.Amazon will now allow some Prime Instant Video movies and TV shows to be downloaded onto the HDX and viewed later. I haven't tried this yet (and I don't know how you identify these videos if this feature is active), but it may be a good enough reason to go with the 32GB or 64GB versions of the HDX if you watch a lot of videos and aren't always connected to Wi-Fi. By the way, the HDX's memory is in a single partition where you can store anything, including books/audio books/magazines, apps, music, and videos. With my 32GB version of the HDX, about 25GB was free when I got the device.The most innovative new feature in the HDX is the \"Mayday\" button. Amazon says this will connect you with a real person who can in real-time walk you through a problem. (You must have an active internet connection to do this.) I just had to try it, so I did. \"Katie\" came online in just a few seconds, and after verifying my name, home address, and email address, she helped me with a couple of questions I had. That's remarkable customer service.As good as it is, though, the HDX isn't perfect. Here are my biggest disappointments:* They took the HDMI port away. Granted, with Prime streaming videos and our Roku box, I didn't use it often, but I wish it was still there. Amazon has announced that there's a software update coming that will let you send video through a PlayStation 3 or to certain Samsung TVs, but I don't have either of those.* There's still no GPS in the Wi-Fi HDX, although unless you have the 4G model (which includes GPS), it doesn't matter so much. In any case, you can still use apps like MapQuest for trip planning.* No speech recognition. I really hate this. Without this feature, there won't be any cool apps like Apple's Siri or Android's Speaktoit Assistant. Actually, you can install Speaktoit Assistant from the Amazon appstore, but you have to type in commands instead of speaking them. (Note: I read somewhere that it's possible to download Google Voice Search from the Google Play store, enabling speech recognition on the Kindle Fire.) There is a microphone, though, so you can use voice recorder apps and music recognition apps like Shazam and SoundHound.But despite a few disappointments, I'm generally very pleased with the HDX. It's a superb tablet. Although the Amazon appstore is still dwarfed by Google Play, Amazon's vast media library of books and magazines, videos, and music more than makes up for fewer apps, at least for me. The very smooth Silk web browser is greatly improved, and setting up email accounts and using email is very easy.I haven't bought a cover for the HDX, although I'm sure I will, since my old HD case won't fit the HDX. Amazon has its \"Origami\" case, and other companies are already advertising their HDX cases, but I'll wait a month or two and see what all is out there before buying one. Fortunately, the HDX's size is close enough to the HD's that the padded sleeve I got for the HD is big enough for the HDX.And a pleasant surprise: Kindles always ship with a USB charging cable, but I was surprised to see a wall charger in the box too.Bottom line: I really like the HDX, and for me it was worth the upgrade from my year-old HD.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not Worth the Aggravation of the Connection Problems", "Author": "Wayne \"wyadams\"", "ReviewID": "R31UC33XHKN8MS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It seems that Amazon is aware that the Kindle Fire has problems connecting and staying connected to wireless networks, and has chosen to ignore the problem and continue to sell this piece of garbage.

It disconnects from our network at random times, and at other times will not connect at all, sometimes for an entire day. At the same time this is happening, I am sitting next to her using my Motorola Xoom which has a good strong (four bars), stable connection, so it is not a network problem, it is a device problem. In fact no other wireless device on our network has EVER had connection problems.My recommendation is to find some other HD tablet and wait for Amazon to get the message that they can't foist this kind of garbage on the public and expect us to buy it.In addition, though the display and sound are excellent, there is not enough difference between the Fire and other HD tablets to make it worth the aggravation and hours of dead time.

This will be the third kindle in my household. I currently own a basic e-reader kindle and my fiance has the second generation kindle fire. Let me just say, this one blows all the rest completely out of the water. The display is sharp, the speakers are simply amazing, and the performance is outstanding for the price.Display:The display is crystal clear and is full HD. Just think about that for a second; it has the same resolution as any full size HDTV! On a 7in screen, it really shines. If you hold this side by side to an ipad mini, the display on the fire HDX wins hands down not only in resolution and color, but also clarity.Speakers:This is what impressed me the most about this tablet..... The speakers: Full Dolby HD that have great bass and a nice clear sound. These speakers are better than most laptop speakers. They go loud enough to fill a room and do not lose any of the sound quality.Performance:Performance (at least in my experience) is on par with the current generation ipads. My parents have an iPad and the fire HDX is just as responsive and snappy. No doubt this is due to the new chipset inside. Gone are the days of stutter, missed taps, and lagging swipes. The HDX even does multi-tasking (something that was missing of fire's and fire HD's of past).Battery:I've gotten all day use out of it. Based on my estimates, I will meet the time Amazon advertises, based on my daily usage of games, web browsing, and music. The fire HDX comes with a power cord!!! (Finally!!!). However, this power cord is just adequate. It's only a 5W charger instead of the 9W. As long as you don't need to use the HDX and charge it at the same time, the supplied charger is good. It takes almost all night to fully charge w/ the 5W included adapter. If you're a heavy tablet user, I'd buy the 9W charger.Mayday:This is the best feature of this tablet. It works just as you see on tv! I had an issue setting up part of my HDX. I hit the mayday button, and 10 seconds later I was chatting with a live person! I was shocked that it was exactly as you see on TV! This is perfect for anyone who is new to kindle, or to the world of tablets. I can see this being a definite benefit.Overall:The fire HDX is the best kindle to date. The performance is second to none, the display is great, the speakers are some of the best I've ever heard on a tablet, and the mayday feature is icing on the cake! I think the price is right on the mark for what you get. It's a great value tablet and a great performing tablet all in one.One note of caution:The charging port is on an angle and if you're not careful, I could see this being an issue down the line. If you try to lay the HDX screen side down, you will bend and put stress on the charging cable.", "Date": "October 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Big bang for your buck", "Author": "Kendall Giles",

the buck, the Kindle Fire HDX 7\u2033.Here's what's in the box:* Kindle Fire HDX 7\u2033 tablet computer* Micro USB charging cable* AC adapter* Quick-start guideMy Kindle powered up right away out of the box, and after entering password information for my firewall and a few other simple admin steps, I was online and ready to go.In fact, the Kindle Fire HDX immediately populated the Books, Videos, and Music tabs with items I had previously purchased on Amazon. All I had to do was tap the icon for the James Bond: The Authorised Biography, by John Pearson, or the album cover for the new Black Sabbath album 13 and, after a brief download, I was reading and rocking, respectively.Aside from the ease of getting online and using the device without a lot of hassle, I enjoyed several welcome features:* The Kindle felt good in the hand: the dimensions of the unit are 7.3\u2033 x 5.0\u2033 x .35\u2033, and at 303 grams in weight (lighter than the Apple iPad Mini 2), it was easy for me to hold with one hand.*  The display was absolutely brilliant: at 1920\u00d71200 pixels, the 7\u2033 screen clocks in at 323 Pixels Per Inch (PPI), which is up there with the best of the tablets. The text was crisp, the images gorgeous, and the videos seamless. As a writer and Computer Scientist, I'm accutely aware of technology getting in the way of what John Gardner calls the \"vivid and continuous dream\" enjoyed when immersed in a compelling story. This display, along with the quad-core CPU and user inteface supplied by the Kindle Fire OS 3.0 \"Mojito\", does not get in the way of what you are reading or seeing.* After a couple days use, I'm still using the device as I got it right from the box. The rated battery life is 11 hours of mixed use, and 17 hours when reading.* The dual Dolby audio stereo speakers crank out adequate volume, though the 3.5mm stereo headphone jack helps me really tune out the world when I'm listening to an audio book or movie or Black Sabbath.* The front-facing camera and built-in microphone are useful especially for Skype calls.* The unit's Bluetooth support and video streaming capabilities are helping me get in shape, since I can watch movies and crank the volume with an external Bluetooth speaker when running on a treadmill.* The unit came with lots of built-in apps that allowed me to be productive and entertained right out of the box, with more available on Amazon.Note that I haven't yet used the Mayday button, which is supposed to connect you, if you need help, to an Amazon expert 24\u00d77, but it's a nice feature to have in my back pocket.Also, I was already a Prime member, which gives me free 2-day shipping when shopping on Amazon, the ability to stream or download Prime Instant videos, and a free ebook a month, so the 30 days of free Prime membership with the purchase of the Kindle Fire HDX was lost on me, but I did start downloading some movies so that I can watch them offline for on an upcoming trip--being able to tune out your surroundings by diving into a movie is wonderful when stuck in those cramped airline seats.My video shows the unboxing and the Kindle Fire HDX in action.So to me, this tablet provides a big bang for your buck.", "Date": "October 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "BATTERY DOESNT LAST, AMAZON.COM SENDS REFURBISHED REPLACEMENT", "Author": "Jeanne D Day", "ReviewID": "R33FG0IPX75104", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This kindle fire HDX has not held a charge since it arrived early December.

Ricucci", "ReviewID": "R1DBW18TQ7Z7ED", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After 11 days of using the Kindle Fire HDX 7\", HDX Display, Wi-Fi, 32 GB -- and now editing slightly thanks to a couple of helpful Amazoners:What I LIKE about the HDX:- Slim, light, more mobile & easier to handle than the Fire HD which was heavy/unwieldy for my arthritic hands- Gorgeous display, crisp and beautiful- Easy setup, very simple even for a senior lady like me- This model includes a charger. Yay!! (The Fire HD did not come with a charger.)- Responds quickly, very intuitive- Email program is great, nicely laid out & easy to set up all my accounts -- my Mac account, my MS Exchange work account, my Gmail accounts- As an Amazon Prime member, I have a huge selection of movies, TV & music available at no additional cost- It's just a smooth operation, does what I want it to do simply and very quicklyWhat I DON'T LIKE about the HDX:- No way to know when device is fully charged; no green light as on other Kindles; you have to turn it on and unlock to see whether it's fully charged- Speakers on the back means you have to be careful and aware of which way you're holding the device so your hand isn't covering one of the speakers; I don't think the placement is all that great.- The micro USB port at the bottom, where you plug in the charger, is at an odd angle. Often when I go to charge the device, it takes me a couple of tries to get the plug into the port. Seems strange, something which could have been done better.I really like the Fire HDX, much better than the Fire HD and I know I will very much enjoy it. As an all-around device for music, videos, email, web browsing, games, keeping up with news/weather/sports on-the-go, etc., I can definitely recommend the HDX. It's not perfect (does anyone know a device which is?) but if the HDX does what you need, you will love it!UPDATE on 12/5/13 -- I've now had the device for about 6 weeks and am using it heavily, much more than my previous Kindle. It keeps surprising me in terms of the things it will do and the way it fits into my work & leisure needs. I don't know if I just got lucky, but I swear there is no blue haze on my screen. BOTTOM LINE: I'm very happy with the HDX. Now if I could just discipline myself to put it down....", "Date": "October 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Tablet For the Amazon Ecosystem", "Author": "Christopher", "ReviewID": "RBHK0EOJ7QRS5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I live in the Amazon Ecosystem.  I buy my movies from Amazon Instant Video, I pay for the Cloud Music service, and I've been a Kindle reader since the first generation.  I've had iPads, Nexus and Surface tablets, and while they offer most of the Amazon services through various Apps, none are as cohesive as the Kindle Fire.  I was hesitant to upgrade to this years model, as I absolutely loved the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 last year, but I wanted a smaller tablet, and the specs this time around were rather impressive.The first thing I noticed about the Kindle Fire HDX was not the screen (although it is rather impressive), but the weight.  Make no mistake, this tablet is thin, and this tablet is light.  It makes movie watching and reading a pleasure, even one handed for a long period of time.The screen - a nice upgrade over last years model, it's bright, vivid and the text is crisp, which is helpful, especially for reading.  I did not notice any blue hue that some people complain about.The sound - I didn't notice a huge quality difference over last year (and I liked last year's), but moving the speakers to the top of the device and slanting them makes a huge difference, especially since I hold my tablet and the bottom and would constantly cover last years.Speed - I noticed a huge speed increase over last years model.  The interface is fast and fluid, and I have not noticed any slow down so far.What I don't like, or what they could improve upon:Rear facing camera - I was hoping the 7\" model would have one like the 8.9, but not so.  I use my tablet for Skype so the grandparents can see their 2 year old grandchild, and it's much easier to use the rear camera to chase her around the room, so I was a little bummed about that.  Hopefully next year.HDMI out - I was disappointed to see it didn't make it into this years model.  I travel quite a bit, so it was nice to hook the Kindle Fire up to the Hotel's TV and relax at night.  I bought the NETGEAR PTV3000 to use the Miracast Feature, but it would have been nice to use the cable I already had.Apps - It has most of the ones I'd want on a tablet, but access to Google Play would be nice (without rooting)Long story short (too late), if you live in the Amazon Ecosystem, this is a great tablet, especially for the price.", "Date": "November 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "No Longer A Huge Fan of Amazon Nor Kindles", "Author": "HK", "ReviewID": "R2S0EAN0Y6ZSPX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This was my fifth kindle.  I have also owned the original kindle fire and loved it til it suddenly stopped charging- even after I was very careful in taking care of it and did not use it extensively.  Kindle support informed me that some of the original kindles had this issue.  When I heard the new kindle fire hdx was coming out I had high hopes that Amazon would have solved the issue of the battery port giving out prematurely, but within a month of receiving it, I started experiencing the same issue on my new kindle fire hdx!  Sometimes it would charge, other times it wouldn't.  I was so disappointed in this similar repeat of history, I decided that I would simply return it for a refund and not risk more money wasted, so I put it aside and stopped using it.  My biggest mistake was waiting for the hustle of the busy holidays to pass before calling Amazon thinking Amazon is so great with returns, another few weeks shouldn't be an issue!  My other mistake was not realizing the interpretation of their one year warranty was completely up to the whim of their representatives.  Their one year limited warranty states as some options, that a new device may be given as a replacement, and also that refunds may be given- and does not state when or when not.  I fully trusted that Amazon would come through for one of their loyal prime customers; I mean we've all read about Amazon's great customer service in the past and in others' reviews!  However, my New Year has now been completely soured by my latest experience with Amazon, and I will never view Amazon nor it's kindle products the same ever again.  On New Year's Day I called and asked for a refund because this had been my second experience with kindle fires having charging/ battery port issues, and it happening again to such a new product that had just came out- I didn't want an exchange until I was sure this would not happen again.  They refused me a refund because my thirty days had passed.  In the end after several more requests for a refund, I settled for an exchange of a product I no longer trusted in.  The order invoice said a new kindle hdx was on its way, and I was willing to give it a second try because what other option did I have?  I packed up my new condition kindle with its power charger and the original box- thinking what a shame- still brand new if it wasn't for the charging issue, and dropped it off at UPS.  Today the replacement arrived.  I was so disappointed and shocked to open the amazon box and find no packaging at all including, no original kindle box, and just a refurbished kindle without even a charger- just a dusty cord!!  I had sent everything that came with my kindle in its still new box back to Amazon!  Not only had I received a refurbished kindle as opposed to a new one when I had only owned my new generation kindle hdx for a little over two months (I received it at the end of October), but now I felt like I got an even shabbier deal because Amazon didn't even have the decency to  package my replacement in its original box with a fully working charger!  When I called customer service I was upset for the above reasons, and one of the kindle support reps spoke to me in a very patronizing tone and yelled at me and threatened to stop helping me if I continued to be upset.  The biggest reason for my upset and frustration was because I had really trusted that Amazon would be reasonable and willing to work with me and help me out.  Every time I was put on hold was a ten to twenty plus minutes wait and in the end, the \"higher ups\" were also completely unwilling to help me - still no refund or no promise of a new kindle, just \"a repeat of \"no we can't\" , \"no we can't\"... \"We can't issue a refund\"even though if I had received the new kindle just even a little later when it was expected to ship out, I may have qualified for the extended holiday return policy that starts with November shipments. The patronizing agent told me it was my fault for not reading the whole email sent with the label which would have told me to keep all of the accessories and only send the device- why would I keep the accessories when I thought I was getting a new replacement?!  And how is that ethical to keep part of the product? When I went back to my original email later, I did not see any small print about keeping the box and all the accessories, though I did fimd on the amazon website that it is not necessary to send in the charger or manual.  I would still think a refurbished electronic device would come paired with a charger if it was originally offered with the device?!  The friendlier agent I spoke with on New Year's promised that Amazon always takes care of its customers, so don't worry- if I have further issues with the replacement to just call back.  At that time, I ended the call still agreeing with him about Amazon looking out for its customers.  And even on that day, I had called - expecting a full refund, and though not getting it, believed Amazon would at least replace a two month old bestselling device with a new product for a very disappointed customer.  However, today after an hour long run around and dismissals and no one willing to truly work with me, I am no longer a fan of Amazon.  It's too bad because I used to rave about Amazon and kindles and what I believed was true about Amazon customer service being one of the best out there.  When customer service stops coming through for you or the company stops caring about its individual customers, it's time to stop believing in its products.", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Gorgeous device, but some things you should know....", "Author": "BarbZ", "ReviewID": "R2ROLCJAJ0O1C7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This device is a breathtaking movie watching device, but falls short in other areas.  Some will feel like \"nits,\" but I wanted to mention them, since they were surprising to me, and they are things you should know:Screen:  Gorgeous.  Movies are breathtaking, full of depth.Movie watching:  While watching a movie (streaming or downloaded), you can tap the screen, hold the progress bar, and scroll forward/backward in the film with a preview screen which shows you exactly where you'll land when you release your touch on the screen.  Great!  XRay for movies is also a nice feature, and in some cases, gives you \"goofs\", so you can check out the filming mistakes on your own!Sound: Incredible.  For movie viewing, this is really like having a mini theater in your lap.  I stand the device in an old Kindle Fire cover so that the sound is projected towards the front by the folded back cover.  It feels like you are in a theater.  This is the first device I've ever used (been satisfied with the sound) without headphones, and if you aim the sound toward you, it's stunning.  I've watched about four films, and I wouldn't think of using headphones with this device.Mayday: Great feature.  I used it twice.  I had an agent available in less than a minute, and they stuck with me until the issues were resolved.Setup/Glitches: I had one hang up/reboot.  Your device will do a software update while booting for the first time, which takes at least 10 minutes.  Note:  I have some video enhanced Kindle books.  They would not run on this device, however, they ran on my older Kindle Fire, hence one of my calls to Mayday.  I expect there will be some inconsistency in older/newer generation devices with some materials.Storage:  16G is really 10.6G, so expect it to go quickly.  I would order the 32G if I were ordering again.Downloads:  A nice feature.  I downloaded a couple of short television episodes in order to test this.  The downloads took longer than expected, however, based on my service and typical download times.Why I didn't give it five stars:The high definition of the device makes some text and images too small to see/read, so this is not a viable web browsing device for me.Integration/Intrusion: Great for Amazon, not so great for the user/device owner.  I'm very disappointed in one thing: When you download a book sample and try to read it, there is a yellow button in the bottom third of the screen that says:  Buy Now.  When you purchase a book, a bar/box appears across the bottom third of the screen (when reading) asking you to try the audiobook (similar button)...and the audiobook sample is already downloaded to your device!  This is:  1. very intrusive to the reading experience.  The bar/box blocks a portion of the book's text (the bottom third of the page).  You have to tap the screen to remove it.  Also, if each time you download a book, you are downloading an Audible sample, this is simply a sales tactic at the expense of unnecessary bloat to the storage on your device.  This is really disappointing from a company that understands exactly what the purity of a reading device should be. I find these sales pitches in the middle of my reading experience to be annoying!Reading:  Not great on this device.  There is a purplish border around the screen when reading which I find fatigues my eyes.  I read easily on my iPad, Kindle Fire Gen 2, even the new Paperwhite.  This will not be my first choice for a reading device.Form factor:  Very nice, and easy to hold, except for one thing:  the micro USB plug is at an angle to the device.  It is very difficult to insert the plug on my device, and also difficult to remove.  I'm not sure about the viability of that connector in light of the force needed to insert and remove it.No Battery Indicator light:  This may seem like a small thing, but I find it very annoying.  When you plug in the device, there is no indicator light to tell you when the battery is charged.  I couldn't believe it!  In order to know if the device is charged, you have to turn on the device, and check the screen.  I called Mayday to confirm this, since I simply thought I was missing it.  Now when I plug the device in, I check to see when the plug loses its heat to know that it's charged.  Seems ridiculous to me.Overall:It really depends on what you want to use this device for.  As a pure movie absorbing device, it's 6 stars!I recommend ordering with more memory.  I was going to order the Kindle Fire HD with 16G of storage.  Then, I realized that the price difference after upgrading the memory in the low end device was only $60 to the 7 inch HDX with 16G, so I decided to go with it, in light of the many other differences in the specs.  I think that was the right decision, but I don't expect the memory to go very far in light of the other issues I've mentioned.I need to do more reading, and check the device connector, and keep an eye on the memory before deciding whether or not to keep the device.  I'll update this review, as I learn more.Enjoy!", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "love it!", "Author": "Pavic", "ReviewID": "R2OIC7C543S2IZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Thank you Amazon for another wonderful product, it came right on time for me!I'm an avid reader, so when someone stole my Kindle Fire three weeks ago, it was as if a good friend was taken away from me. Kindle was already a part of my life, it made the books and therefore my contact with the English language (which is not my mother tongue) easier for me. Since I had so much personal content on it, I felt as if someone invaded my private life and totally messed up my little daily rituals.Although I reported it to the police and had Amazon freeze my old device for me (I can't thank them enough for their promptness), it did not turn up, so my husband and I decided to buy this new one. It has just arrived today, but from what I've seen so far this one is much, much better.My first impulse was to look at the books (by the way, it came with the majority of the books on my account already installed, which is again something I am thankful to Amazon for) and the screen seems better than the old one. To be honest, that was my main concern - I was a bit nervous as I knew it was smaller than my old Kindle Fire, but it turned out ok. I even went outside and read with the sunset reflecting on my screen and everything was easily readable.The second thing that I noticed about it was the speed - not only it's much faster and I downloaded all my music and some of my videos in a heart bit, but I'm also extremely happy that my Jillian Michaels exercise routines are downloadable and can be played off-line - now I will be less upset when our Internet company schedules their maintenance!The sound, as far as I'm concerned, is clear too, and I don't mind the way they put their off and on and volume buttons in the back - I got accustomed to them very quick.I also like the fact that the device is now compatible with Youtube videos, that used to be a constant source of frustration for me on the old one. Back then having a kindle seemed to me like setting your priorities - I wanted to choose my books over the youtube content, and I had to deal with not being able to play many other things. Now I don't have to make that choice anymore; this kindle incorporates the amazing Amazon reader and a tablet. That is very nice and I don't think there's anything similar on the market at the price!I haven't tried the apps or the games enough to comment on them, but I will update my review if I find it necessary. Maybe I'll find something negative to say, although that's very unlikely :PIn other words, thank you Amazon, I love my new device! I'm glad in a way that I had a reason to buy this one right off after it came out!Update 10.25.13: It's been two days since I got the Kindle and I'm still perfectly content with it. I've seen people around complaining about the blue / purple haze around its border - in all honesty, I had to read their reviews to realize it's there. And now that I see it, I think it really gives more depth to the screen. It doesn't impede my reading at all, on the contrary...I've also downloaded some of their games and apps and everything runs smoothly.I even used the Mayday button once; as I expected the Amazon specialist was impeccable in their reply and helped me immediately. However, the Kindle is so easy to use that there's almost no need for Mayday :)I still think this is the best device you can get out there for the price. Go for it and you won't regret it!Update: 11.06.2013 While trying to Skype on the new Kindle, I found out that this one is a little too sensitive to movement compared to the previous model. Every time I moved the camera it would make a clicky sound and the image would freeze. Somehow I have the feeling that the way it receives the Internet signal is slower or something of the sort. The former Kindle seemed a little better with that I didn't have any problems moving the camera while talking on Skype.", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sublime!", "Author": "Travel Fan", "ReviewID": "R2KDJ0C1SL0DHK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had a chance to enjoy my new Kindle HDX 64GB, Wi-Fi only for a few days now. The packaging was great and worry free. I could tell that Amazon took care to make sure that my new toy would arrive safely. My first Kindle was a keyboard kindle which I loved. However, when the previous generation HD came out, I could not resist the call to enjoy color again. I had missed seeing my book covers/pictures in color. I loved all the HD had to offer, the games, internet browsing and being able to check my email while on travel. It was a great little device, but alas, when the HDX came out, it just had a little more of what I was looking for. I bought it for the lighter weight, the extended battery life, higher resolution, etc.. the same reasons everyone else bought one. I traded in my HD with Amazon and this is where I have to praise Amazon for their excellent customer service. My mother had also asked me to trade in her HD along with mine, so we sent them in one package. We followed instructions, submitted the trade in and waited patiently. After two weeks, I could see that they had received the package, but nothing was happening. After contacting Amazon, they responded within the hour and discovered that apparently our items had somehow been lost. At any rate, they could see that they had been delivered and gave us an immediate provisional credit. Later, they did find one of the devices, but to make things right, they gave an additional credit for that item on top of letting us keep the full provisional credit for both devices. Now that is superior customer service! Hard to find that anymore. They were prompt, courteous, and resolved our issue (and I dealt with three different customer service reps). Anyway, on to the HDX. This is a spectacular little device. It is much lighter, more compact and easier to hold than my HD was. It is also quite a bit faster, whether checking email or browsing. I also enjoy my reading experience. Of course I have to mention the blue haze issue. After reading previous reviews, I have to admit that I was a little concerned. However, I need not have worried. It is a non issue to me personally, I had to look really hard to see it and I find that it is actually easier on my eyes than a stark white page. I do not see it at all when browsing or checking email. I have downloaded some music and find the sound quality to be at least as good as what I experienced on my previous gen HD. I can't wait to view my newly purchased HD LOTR trilogy on this device as the screen so far has been highly impressive. I also decided to purchase the HDX with 64 GB as I found that the 16GB in my previous device just wasn't enough to accommodate the downloading of several movies for when I travel. I would highly recommend the higher storage capacity for anyone who is wanting to download movies, especially those of HD quality. Also, I have used the charging port several times and have not been bothered with the angle at all. In fact, because of the angle, I have found it easier to plug in than with my last device because I had to hold that one exactly level in order for me to be able to insert the cord. I have only one more thing to say about the HDX and other Kindle tablets. They are not IPads, nor will they ever be IPads. If I had wanted a tablet with the features of an IPad, I would have bought an IPad. Thank goodness I do not want that, which means I can get everything I want for a lot less money than I would have had to spend on an IPad. I have more money to spend on stuff to put on my Kindle. This puts a smile on my face. Kindles are in a category all their own and I love them! Thanks Amazon---------------------------------------------------------Jan 26, 2014I would like to modify my previous review a bit. After using this device for a while, I still love it. However I have noticed considerable eyestrain when reading a book without a lamp at night. My eyes would burn and water. Since then, I have purchased a Paperwhite and have no more problems. So now I use my Paperwhite for reading, it is lighter weight anyway which is better for that purpose, and my HDX for everything else. When I travel though I will still just take my HDX for simplicity and the sync feature makes it easy to continue reading where I left off on my Paperwhite. I still consider both devices to be a good investment.", "Date": "October 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Kindle HDX 7\" Wifi 32 GB", "Author": "Rita", "ReviewID": "R1IWS6AOYTRZS8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First of all, I want to say that I was 4 star happy with my Kindle Fire HD 7\" and have been just as happy or happier with past Kindles.  The Kindle Fire HDX 7\" will be the fifth one for me and my family.I find that the HDX is a good upgrade from the HD.  I haven't found anything yet that would make me want to return it.  There was 60% battery out of the box and for me, setup was a snap.  The HDX connected to my account, downloaded all the info, upgraded and came back up in about 5 minutes.  The hardest part was opening the box.I was very happy to see the charger when I opened the box and not just the wire.  I really hate to buy the extra charging plug.  The one that comes in the box is a smaller charger than the square one Amazon sells.  I don't know all the specs, but I assume it charges slower, but has to be faster than charging through the computer.  I haven't had to recharge completely yet so I don't know how long it will take.  But I am assuming it won't be any longer than with the HD.  I found that so far the power usage is about the same at the HD.  I was on it for several hours last night and used about 15% without running video.  That was setup, book downloading and cruising the features and some internet just to see how the screen looks and check out loading times.  The charging wire does stick out from the kindle at greater than 90 degrees, so one will have to be careful when plugging it in and removing the plug.  Also, you wouldn't want to lay the kindle on it's face when charging, the plug will get in the way.The screen resolution is fantastic. The sound is very good for such small speakers and I haven't seen any buffering with the videos.  Although the cloud did have all of my books, the cloud didn't seem to know which books were still on my HD. The only books on the HDX when it arrived were the ones I purchased since I put in my order for the HDX.  When I set up it pulled in the cloud but not the unread books on the HD.  So, I had to run through the HD and download the books I haven't read yet from the cloud to the HDX. The speed is faster than the HD, although not remarkably faster.  It is lighter than the HD which is good for me because I have arthritic hands and can't hold a book. So far the best one from that standpoint was the Touch.Many have complained about the bluish/purple light around the boarder on white pages.  I would not have noticed it if it hadn't been mentioned in the reviews.  It doesn't distract from my reading (and I read a lot), doesn't cause me any eye strain, and I forget it is even there. People complaining because Amazon is trying to put a positive spin on this are na\u00efve.  All companies are going to try and give their products the best spin.  It is up to the customer to like it or not.  Return it if you don't like it.I am happy for the mayday button, but I haven't had a chance to use it yet.  I don't want to contact someone just to say hi.  But I am sure I would use it in a heartbeat if I needed to.  I have never had a problem with phoning tech help, even if it is in India. The user guide was pretty easy to find and I am going through it tonight to see if there is anything I haven't figured out yet.The origami cover isn't really great and hugely overpriced.  It's a little floppy when opening it but the magnets put it tight when you  flip it to the back for handheld reading.  I do like the way it feels, and the magnets that hold everything together and creates the stand are solid.  The kindle is held in the case securely, although it looks like it might fall right out, it won't.  The cover doesn't block the speakers, but seem to enhance the sound by holding the kindle slightly away from the back cover and aiming the sound at you in landscape.  When I stand the kindle in landscape it wiggles a little when I swipe or tape to change pages and seems as if it wants to fall over.  It hasn't yet, but it doesn't seem very stable. The worst is when I stand it in portrait.  The kindle turns itself off and restarts repeatedly.  I don't know if it is the cover on button thingy hitting the table or if the new location of the on button on the kindle itself is poorly thought out.  The on button isn't in the way no matter which way I hold the kindle, it is only a problem when it stands in portrait.  Maybe another cover would work better.  I am going to wait to see what other hard cover is created by other makers.So, I am happy with my purchase and I am glad I upgraded.  I don't use my kindle for more than reading, email, facebook, twitter, and the internet, but I am looking forward to the software upgrade in November.  I am curious to see what kind of business items will appear.  I wish Amazon would notify kindle owners when a new update is available or make it possible to update software automatically when one connects to Kindle.UPDATE 11/3/13 - I am happier than ever with the HDX.  I am experiencing a weird thing with it though.  It may be the Origami cover that is causing this, but 4 times now in the last week the HDX has decided to just restart all by itself.  When it does, it doesn't save a book where I am reading.  I have to hunt for the page I was on.", "Date": "October 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "couldn't agree more", "Author": "Debra Ann Fescina", "ReviewID": "R199IHRUR3XORN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Found the following on the 1-star reviews:  \"From somebody that has owned both products, I was never happier to sell my kindle fire on Craigslist. I've had two apple computers and 4 iPhones as well as two iPad's and I couldn't be happier with them. Everything else is just an imitation. Save yourself the trouble and go straight to the apple store.\" Again, I couldn't agree more.I purchased FOUR Kindle fires last year for grandkids for Christmas.  I have two of them in my home right now that will not charge AT ALL.  The other two, I am waiting to hear from my other grandkids to see if they are having any similar issues.  I have spoken with three representatives from Amazon, and I am hearing the same thing from all of them:  They would be happy to sell me 2 replacement Kindles .. it is the best that they can do.Amazon needs to put into place a remedy for people other than what is written in black and white.  The fact that your people, one who is supposedly a supervisor, cannot stray from the rules and make an exception to a customer who purchased FOUR Kindles and now has TWO not charging at not quite 13 months later is amazing.  There SHOULD be some sort of empowerment to Amazon employees, especially supervisors, to make decisions that are fair to Amazon's customers.  I asked if I could get an exception to the 30 days past warranty; and when told \"NO\" I asked if I could get a discount from the normal $79 replacement cost since I would have to purchase TWO refurbished Kindles.  Again, I was told \"NO\".  At a minimum, Amazon should replace the battery at a REASONABLE cost.  However, that offer was not on the table.Apple, Nook, Nintendo, Bose, Dell, HP.  I have them all (I have a hand-held Nintendo that is literally more than 15 years old - it still works!).  I have never had a product quit working at 13 months ... the only thing close to this is an iPod that only works while on the charger but it is FIVE years old AND it does still work while on the charger!

I now prefer using my HDX over my HD model most of the time.  The performance  is way more solid than my HD.  I still use my HD for my missing Weather app  WeatherBug...and the older version of AccuWeather.  The HD and HDX clearly  use different stores.  I got notes back from app developers....no estimate  of when these apps will be in the HDX store.  Does anyone really care?2.  A new minor app issue for my ESPN scoreboard which nobody wants to address.  The standings font for the stats is too large and overlays the city names  such that NFL Won and Loss numbers overlay the city names.  Very annoying.  Does anyone ever test these new/modified HDX apps?3.  Battery life.  As noted below....it is directly proportional to the brightness  setting.  If you want to conserve your battery life...turn the brightness bar  down to 70-80% of the bar length....to get at least 2 more hours out of your  battery.4.  No HD solid black matrix...more dark grey on the HDX.  I guess I am getting use  to this change.  Still like the black LEDs better.  I also don't notice the  blue edges as much on white screens when I am reading.  With time, we can all  get use to just about anything.5.  I did get the HDX Marware screen protectors.....a must accessory...although way  too expensive.  $14.99 + tax on prime for just 2 plastic sheets.**********************************************************************************First, let me say I really like my Kindle(s), but for those who are consideringan upgrade, I will post my quick review to help you decide if now is the timeto make an upgrade or not, and whether to keep your HD around for certain apps.I am still testing out my new HDX and will update this review as I discover moreabout it.  Normally, I wait a few months before I buy an upgrade for any pieceof hardware, but this time I pulled the trigger early on 11/4 to take advantageof the extra 1 day 15% discount which Bezos gave us for the FAA ruling on wireless devices.

Great price performance (Cheaper and Faster)2. Size and weight (Smaller and lighter footprint for jacket pockets)3. Origami case is ok with fixed magnetic angles but not adjustable4. Mayday Help (Excellent) - Fast response but some advisors are still  learning and some are not familiar with HDs and need 2nd level help.5. Apps and movies seem to be running much smoother with fewer freezes than  HD model.HDX vs HD CON:1. Most disappointing:  Screen background matrix is not a black matrix like theHD...more of a very dark grey with lighter gray spotlight in the middle of the display and shadowing of icons and other objects.  HDX screen seem less sharp than HD despite higher resolution when viewed side by side.  I tried all positions of the brightness bar and turned auto feature on and off with no improvement.  There is no contrast control either per my chat with the Mayday folks.2. Others are correct on the white screen blue edge lines on the bottom and rightside of screens.  The HD would probably be a better choice for those who readmore on their Kindles white screens. I did not notice blue line edge problems for movies and pictures. Choice of the blue LEDs for the HDX might explain this problem and the \"dark gray background\" matrix on the carousel screen.  I am surprised there was apparently not more human factors testing on this model before this release.3. The standard font size for the HDX seems 1 or 2 points smaller for more text than the HD. An issue for older reading glasses users.  Portrait viewing will help this a little.4. I don't like the non-carousel device app icons to be half-way visible at the bottom of my HDX.  There is no * (star) feature on this operating system to hide the apps you don't want visible on your carousel.5. Not all HD apps you have now are available on the HDX.  I am not sure if the Kindle \"Store\" is the same store for the HD and the HDX.  If so, they have a problem.  A good example is one of my favorite free Weather Apps, WeatherBug, which has the blue ladybug icon with rain and snow symbols on shell.  The HDX store says it's there and you try to find this icon in the store and all you get are apps the look or are spelled like it but not the real WeatherBug app.  Meantime the HD Kindle \"Store\" has the real one...and I use it on my HD all the time.  When I called the Mayday folks...they said it probably is still not available for the HDX.  If so, then why does the HDX app store search say it is there???  Another free app, AccuWeather, is there in the store, but has a totally different look andfeel, on the HDX. I still like the HD version better.6. Still no .AVI .MOV or .MVI support for movies, only .MP4.  I had to get a desktop converter software for all my Canon camera movies. (ArcSoft Media Converter 2 is a good one)7. Miss the HDMI port on the HDX.  May use the HD for playback of movies on my HDTVs.  Not sure how fast the wireless \"Mirror\" display will be on the HDX...or if I will have \"Miracast\" compatibility. Seems like the hardwire cable would be faster.8. Battery discharge seems to be faster than the HD for same apps...may be underpowered for the higher screen resolution.  Might require lower brightness setting to conserve battery reserves. Requires additional benchmarking.Final Analysis:I'm sure many of the early \"bugs\" will be worked out of the HDX before the holidays and many of the \"missing apps\" will show up at some point.  I will probably keep my HDX to keep testing and benchmarking it against my HD.  I will not get rid of my HD until I see the improvements on the Con side addressed here and I would advise the current HD users to do the same.  Even if this generation proves to be a disappointment, there is still a lot to like about this one for a new tablet owner.", "Date": "November 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love my Kindle FIre HDX!", "Author": "Sara Karolina", "ReviewID": "RJELLQHFEYV6Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this Kindle Fire. You can read, surf the net (let me just suggest downloading the Dolphin browser, since the Silk browser it comes with isn't that great). And that blue LED light on the side that everyone is complaining about isn't actually flawed, it was a design decision based on lower LED battery using power. The blue LED lights used less power than the white, so they went with the blue. Honestly, it doesn't bother me and I don't really understand what the big deal about it is. You definitely notice it, but more so if you are reading a book but still, it doesn't even matter. The clarity of the screen is amazing. I highly recommend going with the 64 GB, that's what I got. I already have a ton of apps on there and am watching tv shows and movies and barely have any memory used up. I also got the Amazon origami magnetic case for my Kindle Fire, and it's also really good quality.

Size & weight,,,,, lighter and thinner than the ipad mini,,, perfect size to handle. I like the location of the on/off button and volume, much better than my sons HD I dont like to search for buttons on the side.2.

I have not tried the 4 G yet so I cant comment on that.3. Screen WOW its really sharp almost as good as my Samsung 55 in LCD 1080,,,,yes darling it is that sharp.4.

LOOKS the Kindle is a really sharp looking device, speed fast fast fast, screen WOW, sound clear & rich amazon prime works for me, I hate shopping in stores love my books and amazon has it all.So your prob saying wow this is a normal dude posting a review that says this thing is pretty much perfect, well it does seem this way BUT,,,,,,,,,yea there is always a BUT, the only thing i see that should be included is a back facing camera not that I am one of those parents you see waving their IPAD around at a school play or my kids basketball game but sometimes your 5 year old does something so cute while your reading a book you just want to snap the pic, this is so minor that I really dont care but just putting it out there for Amazon ( cough cough ) .Did I mention I did NOT have a blue or purple light around the border !!!!Thanks for letting me post my 2 cents on this wonderful device & Merry Christmas to all !!!!!! ;)ps what is the best screen covers & case to get ???On a side note I returned the Kindle it to small for me and I had to drop it down to a 2 stars for being hung up on by customer service twice and the really bad screen flicker !!!!", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Shocked by how bad this Kindle is", "Author": "alana", "ReviewID": "R13VX6O3LRMI2G", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I really wanted to love this tablet.  I love the variety and price of books available in the Kindle store, so I thought I would step out of my Apple cocoon and try a Kindle Fire for an e-reader.  I was so excited, but within 1 HOUR of owning the Kindle HDX, I quickly became really, REALLY bummed with it and decided to return it right away.  For the price, you would think you would get a decent quality tablet, but there were some major red flags right away.I will start with the GOOD news first (and the only reason why I give this item 1 star):- The MayDay feature is amazing.  GREAT job by Amazon on this one!  The tech supporters were friendly, helpful, and excellent with customer service.  I used this feature a couple times, and each time a tech person responded in about 10 seconds.  Obviously, as more Kindle HDXs are sold, and the tech department gets busier, they will be slower in their response time, but that's fine!  It's such a great feature, that it's worth waiting 20 min for.  Even though I was ultimately disappointed with the Kindle HDX, I was really impressed with the tech support available.  This is one major feature missing from Apple.Now, for the BAD news:- Froze 3 times on me in about ONE hour.  That's ridiculous.  I didn't download anything on there except for a couple books, so there's no real reason for the damn device to keep freezing on me.  That's the biggest red flag for me with this device.  One hour in, and the damn thing keeps freezing, so I can imagine how much worse it's going to get as the device gets older and I download more things.- Kept getting error messages when the device would automatically update after turning it on.  First of all, I don't want it to automatically update when I turn it on, but I guess there's no way around it.  And to top it off, brand new and it's not even updating correctly?  C'mon Amazon!- Apps wouldn't come up correctly after it froze and turned back on.  So after the device kept freezing and I turned it back on (3 times), on the main page where you can see the big books, apps, etc... that you can scroll through, the pictures of the apps wouldn't show up.  It just came up as gray boxes with the Amazon \"box\" logo on it.  Again, I shouldn't be having these type of basic loading issues one hour after opening the box.- There is NO WAY to create \"collections\" in your books library.  Say what???  I've been reading my Kindle books on my iPhone through the Kindle App, and I'm able to organize my books into collections.  But the Kindle Fire doesn't allow me to do this?  This is the most asinine thing I've ever come across!  You'd think that you'd get more features through a Kindle Fire than you would on the Kindle App for a different company's device.  Using MayDay, I talked to a tech who confirmed that yes, you can't organize your collection on the Kindle Fire, but that there were other third party apps that let you do this.  She also said that maybe, with the new software update coming in November, the Kindle Fire may include this feature, but it's a \"maybe\".  I'm sorry, but this is a huge no-no for me if a company can't get their s*** together enough to offer basic organization of your library on their own device, when it's a feature already available in an app for a different company's device.  I know I'm repeating myself, but I'm just so shocked that they can't even get this kind of basic necessity worked out...- THE WORST PART FOR LAST: the BLUE HUE around the edge of the screen.  I read a lot of reviews about how horrible this is, and I thought that I would still give it a try.  I thought that maybe the blue hue isn't visible when you change to the \"sepia\" tone for books.  Um.  Yeah... No, it is still very visible, and it is as annoying as everyone else made it out to be.  I can't concentrate on reading anything bc my eyes kept looking over at the blue hue.  My eyes unconsciously kept floating over to it like a mosquito to a bug zapper.  While I was trying to read, I caught myself thinking, \"wow, that blue hue is ridiculous, it's really visible, how horrible, I can't stop staring at it... so weird...\"  When buying an Amazon Kindle product, I expected a seamless and easy screen to read off of, and this totally FAILED.  So again, when I talked to a tech rep about it, she kept saying that the blue hue is \"completely normal.\"  Um, no.  I spent $250 for the device (without \"special\" promotions) and as the client, I will tell you what I think \"normal\" is.  Trust me when I say that the blue hue is NOT IN ANY WAY \"NORMAL\".  I know this is what she's trained to say, but I felt like Amazon was just trying to CON me. LIKE INSISTING THAT I'M EATING CHICKEN WHEN I HAVE THE SNEAKING SUSPICION THAT I'M EATING CAT.  After looking at countless of different types of computer/device screens, we are intelligent enough consumers to know what is a \"normal\" screen and what isn't.  A blue hue around the edge of a device does not feel \"normal\".  Amazon should seriously listen to all the reviewers' comments about how bad this screen is and just apologize instead of trying to tell us that it's \"NORMAL\".SO - after all these problems within one hour of using the device, I have decided to return to my Apple cocoon and buy an IPad Mini.  Yes, it's much more expensive, but in my opinion, it makes no sense to pay $250 bucks for a device that has so many problems that make it unusable when you can spend an extra $150 more and get SO MUCH MORE that works BEAUTIFULLY.  Sorry Amazon, but you completely failed on this one.  Please listen to your customers' complaints about this device.  We are especially right about the screen - it's HORRIBLE.  Stop telling us that it's \"normal.\"", "Date": "October 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Blue Edges and Yellow Tone Very Distracting", "Author": "S.

This review is specifically for parents hoping to use the free time app, which is the specific reason why we bought this kindle. (we already have two others)First, the app is not intuitive at all. I see no reason to make it so difficult to navigate. I can never figure out where I am or where I need to go and find myself having to log in all over again while trying to navigate it.Second, there is no way to control content under the amazon free time subscription. We chose NOT to use this app, because it means giving content control over to Amazon, and we don't necessarily agree with them on what is good content for our child. They include things we would not and leave out things our child would like that we find acceptable for him.Third, even if you have a prime account, you cannot stream free video content within the free time app unless you pay for the subscription to use the content amazon has chosen. Within the free time app, you must purchase and download any vidoes your kid wants to watch.Fourth (this is minor compared to the other three, but still an issue for us), it would be nice if there was an option for reading time vs other time. Right now we have to set individual app and video times. We'd like him to be able to choose either for the full amount of time. Not that he often will, but we'd love for him to be able to choose educational apps for his full allotment of time. Also, a lot of apps have videos, and netflix ends up being an app, so the line between apps & videos is blurred anyway.If you are a parent who thinks this will make managing time with electronics easier, think again.", "Date": "January 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Mayday Saves the Day", "Author": "spark", "ReviewID": "R3SJPD6D5ZZV34", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I waited all day for my new Kindle HDX to arrive, When at 7:00 pm it came, I was already to manage, download and put it to a workout.

She recognized right away that there was a problem since there was no video feed. She had me \"update\" the system. And the update fixed all the problems I had encountered. During the update, the Kindle had disconnected from Mayday Heather, but when I tried Mayday again, I got Heather again( :-) )  and this time with video feed.

Sadly, it was not to be.  I assessed several different tablets, making charts on hardware, performance' pros & con's etc.  Here are the HDX's pros & con's and a footnote of why I ultimately chose another one.PROS ~AMAZING picture quality.  Color conformity was the best of any of the tablets in the running.  The Nexus 7 was a very close second but the HDX's black level added more depth.  Interestingly, you lose some of that brilliance if you go up from the 7 to the 8.9.Sound was the best of all tested models.  Excellent volume, base and clarity.The on/off & volume buttons take a little getting used to, but the dimensions and solid feeling of the device help you get used to their unusual placement.  I appreciated the non-slick, rubbery feel of the HDX's covering.The Mayday feature is a great addition, and I think other companies should follow suit.  I saved myself a lot of time just by asking them a 20 second question that might have taken me 10 minutes to find searching the web.The front camera was the hands down best out of the tested competition.  It looked like a regular camera picture.  Actually, if you could figure out how to maneuver it, good camera shots could be taken with the front camera.Connectivity to everything Amazon based was, of course,  excellent.The Silk browser works smoothly, but I missed features of other browsers.The sale price is 229 for a 32gb model was great.CONS ~The blue/purple \"frame\" around every white screen is not acceptable, should not have to be \"worked around\" and is definitely NOT normal, no matter how much Amazon wants you to think it is...I really do love Amazon, but I couldn't shake this Orwellian feeling that Amazon was Big Brother & the Mayday button was put there to spy on us. :-)  Seriously though, they lack flexibility and are \"android based\" but not a fully functional android.  Picture a bird with some feathers clipped so they can't fly.If I fully understood what it meant to have NO access to Google play store, I would have considered more carefully.  It's not like comparing apples to oranges.  Well, in this case apples to androids to kindles.  Yes, they are trying to improve their app library, but they have a LONG way to go.  On a side note, I found it frustrating to not be able to use the same apps as my friends & family.Although the readability initially seems great (esp if you go to black with white writing to ignore the purple frame), you don't want to compare it with the HDX 8.9.  Side by side the 7's reading screen on white looked \"dirty\" compared to the 8.9's crisp whiteness (same purple haze on both sadly).  I kept checking the 7's settings to make certain it wasn't on sepia.IN A NUTSHELL ~I wanted to choose the HDX, loved the movie experience on it, albeit at 7 inches.  It felt wonderful to hold & performed almost seamlessly.  But I could not overcome the flaws in our relationship.I want to read books on a crisp white screen with no blue/purple border.I want access to ALL things android, apps, browsers, features, not just \"Amazon android\".I finally settled on a very close second with the Nexus 7.  I'm still getting used to the feel of it but a case makes it feel sturdier. I did, however, have no trouble getting used to having all those endless apps available to me again.Hope you all find joy this season in your tablet search!UPDATE 5/28/14Well, I returned the Kindle and kept the Nexus. After awhile I missed the Kindle so much that I bought another one on a huge sale day. I LOVE my Kindle, accept it's limitations and do the unavailable android things I need to do on my phone.The Nexus became the teenagers tablet. It never felt \"good\" in my hands. After 6 months it died. Asus customer support was straightforward enough and they paid for shipping to the warranty dept. But now, it's been over 2 weeks since they received it and I still don't have a working tablet. No updates either. I had to hunt it down online to find out that it's status was \"still in repair\".If it were MY tablet and not my teens, I'd be going nuts. ;)So, I'm happy with my Kindle but probably wouldn't be if I didn't have my Galaxy phone to get my android app fix.", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Happy with it, especially for the price", "Author": "MichaelB", "ReviewID": "R2Y0383TNKPC18", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was debating between Ipad mini and this HDX 7. My home computer is a Mac and my music, contacts and calendar are all on the Mac. I read by eBooks on Kindle touch and like to watch Amazon prime movies. So I am sort of in two worlds. At the end of the day I opted to give this a try based upon price (I got the 15% off price when Amazon had the FAA thank you special). So what do I think, well if you are used to Mac products it is hard to beat their ease of use and how you just plug it in and all your stuff automatically synchs up. The Kindle fire took me a bit to organize and set up although it was nice that all of my books came over from my Touch to the HDX, although they are placed in the Cloud and you have to download the ones you want on your device. Also any books you set up yourself go to your documents tab and not the books tab. I dealt with calendar problem by exporting Ical into Google calendar which does automatically import to the HDX calendar. I was sort of annoyed that you had to buy basic applications that come with an Ipad such as clock and notepad. Since there are several options for these you have to hunt around, read reviews etc. Also - \"free aps\" all come with ads, which is sort of annoying so I would recommend you consider getting the \"upgraded versions\" to avoid ads. Several people have complained about the light blue border on the reader - I noticed it but got quickly used to it and it does not bother me. Watching movies works for me - the 7\" screen is probably similar to watching a movie in the seat back screens of an airplane.

I do not have another tab to use as a reference to compare it with other right now, but when comparing my cellphone (which is at least as bright as the Kindle) it seems to me they could have done something to improve the lighting for outdoors. The color saturation is very good, especially in gaming, but might have a little too much color contrast for some when watching video. When I have used it to watch movies or TV provided using Netflix or my Prime Membership, I've found that video sometimes lags. The lag could be a result of several things, including the hardware or system resources provided on this device. I have 3 computers at home and a Blue Ray player that all stream Prime Instant video, and none of the other devices have similar issues. Let me rephrase that comment. I have seen Prime lock up and lag on all the devices I own, but none of the others have the severity or frequency of problems the Kindle has. Again I would guess it's a lack system resources or possibly a hardware issue.The Flexibility of the Kindle:In terms of flexibility I guess this could be seen as subjective. Here's what I've found to be the problem with the Kindles Flexibility and one of the outstanding issues I've found with it.Amazon had set up packet blocking and redirect on their devices. This means the Kindle will not stream other media from sources. For instance I have an account with Google where I have about 130 Gigs of music stored. My media is stored there free of charge and supports large and various file formats. Though it is a competitor of Amazons Google Play does not block or redirect when you try to access media stored elsewhere. Amazon on the other hand has blocked or diverted most other devices using the Android UI or Android variant from accessing Prime Instant Video. I can access the small amount of music I have stored in Amazons cloud, but Video is blocked. Yes I can access Netflix, and YouTube. There are some sites where the Kindle will either lock up, or be redirected somewhere else. BTW YouTube streams pretty well, but not as smoothly as my 2 year old Droid does though.So four month over all opinion of the Kindle, is that it that if you want a semi-flexible E-Reader this might be a good choice for you. In my case I've found the Kindle to be too limited and it's fallen short of my expectations, and that's even comparing it to my cellphone. The lack of onboard storage (which was promoted earlier on as a none issue for modern users) has turned a real problem and the 16GB version actually leaves the user with closer to 8 or 9GB than the 16GB advertised. It does play some games well, but it has more limitations than implied (the 32GB or larger versions might be able to handle graphics better but...) It will stream Amazons Prime or Netflix Video pretty well, but music outside of Amazons services is a problem. The fact that Amazon begins charging to store music on their site after a certain point seems ridiculous, and they do drop music that you've purchased from their site unless you purchase more space. I feel that Amazon charging to store music that you've bought from them is greedy, but especially since other sites (sites like Google Play) allow free uploading and storage huge amounts of personal music and media.5/11/14...When I decided to purchase the Kindle HDX. I had been looking at several tablets closely for the past few months to use while I was away from home on an upcoming trip expected to last few weeks. And seeing the current price and purchasing options available the Kindle HDX seemed to be an easy choice to me.  Even with my thinking I understood the tablets limitations.The things that attracted me to the Kindle HDX tab, were the processor, it's 4 G LTE compatibility with Verizon, and the fact that I am an Amazon Prime member. I had read that Amazon was expecting people to use their online services for video and music so having membership I was not too concerned about the small amount of storage on the tablet. But that was a mistake on my part. I was thinking I would be able to access the movies that I purchased online with Amazons instant video, and expected to be able to access the 128 gigs of music I have stored on Google Play\", but Google Play media will not load on my Kindle HDX. Amazons cloud does store music up to a point, but it is limited in how much you can store free of charge.  There is an option to purchase additional storage, (I believe it's about $25 a year with other limitations). But the free storage is limited and in my case I've been buying music from Amazon since the 1990's and a lot of my music was displaced by newer purchases without my knowing. So now I'm forced to either purchase additional space or be satisfied with what's there. Personally I feel the additional $25 is a rip off since particularly since the purchase of the kindle and considering my Prime membership, and with other services offer free unlimited uploads of music Amazon seems pretty greedy at this pont.Here are the things I like about the current Kindle HDX Verizon compatible version.1. The processor, it is very fast and loads pages quickly, and the 2 gigs of ram is a respectable amount to assist in performance.2. The variables in personal settings, make the device easy to personalize.3. The display is very nice and video and video games look great, but noting as others have there is a blue cast around the edges which is very noticeable when reading from the device.The not so great things about the Kindle HDX 16 GB.1. The fact that the device does not support storage expansion. It bothers me that my old Droid Bionic cell phone has a SanDisk slot that will let me to expand storage to 64 gigs, but you're stuck with the memory provided on the Kindle you purchase.2. The lack of an HDMI port and to watch TV, you have to purchase a separate device provided and sold by Amazon.3. The Lack of even a mini USB port. Again my old Droid telephone provides a USB port and offers a charging device with a built in USB hub that allows me to connect to any number of external attachments, and this tablet does not.Regretfully the impact of these limitations did not come to mind when I bought the Kindle, but would have if I knew the fully understood the tablets limitations.Would I recommend this tablet to friends or family? Only if they were a member of Amazons Prime services and fully understood its limitations, including storage and the area support of their carrier.So over all, for basic users or those wanting a reading device with very nice options living in an area with Wi-Fi and who have good 4 G coverage the Kindle would probably be an OK purchase. But only if they are fully aware of the limitations of this tablet. Especially the limitations of the tablets onboard storage. 16 gigs is just too little to carry much media with you, with the device using a large part of that 16 gigs, for it's UI and OS you are not even getting a full 16 gigs (more like 10). Then tablet not supporting SanDisk memory expansion (which seems contrived to me), leaves the user too dependent on Amazons premium services for my tastes.(Update 4/14/14) The packet blocking used to keep people tied to Amazons Media Content (or at least their Music App) needs to be removed. In my review above, I mentioned that I have had issues accessing my music stored on My Google Play Music site. But at that time I wasn't sure that this was my being impatient, not waiting for the site to load completely even though I did wait for five minutes, or if it was Amazon using packet blocking and redirection to keep people tied to their services. More recently I found that when trying to access my music on the Google site I was redirected to  the \" My Books Recommendations\". I believe the Kindle site offers better deals, and has a wider selection than Googles offerings, but Googles music site includes downloads at the same cost and higher resolution (320 Kbps vs. the 190-240 Kbps at Amazon). More over recently a few friends told me they have run into the same issue when trying to access their media stored at other various sites (that are either free or that do not charge what Amazon does for their \"Premium Cloud Services\").As someone else has mentioned in their review of the Kindle. Amazon has included adds on the Kindle HDX that are not present on other tablets (even basic inexpensive Android tablets do not have invasive adds). If I pay Amazon another fee I understand I can have those adds removed. But all of these fees really add up, and it seems to me that since I've already paid for this device, these additional fee's, and packet blocking with proprietary redirection are unacceptable and possibly illegal. Who Gives amazon the right to block content and force you to view advertisements on a device of this nature!At this point I would honestly suggest looking elsewhere unless your absolutely sure that the problems mentioned above will not come into play for you or the one you are purchasing this device for. The idea of an e-reader with expanded abilities is one thing, but to advertise the Kindle HDX as a tablet able to compete with an I-Pad, and then throw things like site redirection, packet blocking to limit access media storage to their proprietary services makes me wish I had purchased anything other than this device.", "Date": "March 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Oh dear sweet baby Jesus...I'm in love!", "Author": "HotMessPrincess", "ReviewID": "RGGLLVVS9K0E9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Can I just say that I love this new Kindle Fire HDX 7\" (64 gig) so much that I'd make out with it if I wasn't persnickety about getting drool on the glass?Where to start...First, I should confess my sins. Last May, I abandoned my first generation Kindle Fire for a brief affair with an Asus Google Nexus tablet. Sure, it was good looking and seemed to work just fine but in the end it left me feeling empty and cold...and feeling guilty for cheating on Amazon just because there's no Microsoft OneNote app available for Kindle. Four months of very little Amazon love had me begging to come back - and when the HDX was announced, I found my chance and grabbed one. I'll learn to love the Evernote app instead of OneNote, but please never separate me from Amazon again. \u00a2\u00beThe display is breathtakingly sharp and beautiful. It's such a great picture that I had trouble focusing on the movie because I was in awe over how clear and sharp the image on the screen was. Hubby caught me staring at it with my yap wide open, a frozen expression of awe on my face. (I think he might have been a little too happy to find me speechless.)The sound is phenomenal, especially for such a little device. I really didn't think there would be much difference between the Google 7 tablet mentioned above and the Kindle Fire HDX but there is a HUGE difference. I'm so glad. This little bad boy puts all other tablets to shame. When the sound started playing out the speakers I flipped it over and started looking for them...I have no idea why or what I expected to find, but the amazing quality of sound blew me away. It was almost surround sound-ish, if you know what I mean.The Fire works the same as I remember with my first one. There's a carousel containing your most recently viewed content and a favorites section below. I wish there was a way to store my content in categories like the old Kindle Keyboard. I miss being able to put all my reference books together, all my fiction together, and so on - but I'm told that there's a software update coming in mid-November that will allow us to do just that. Again...I love you, Amazon!I bought the Fire with ads on it, which isn't like it sounds at all. There are no pop ups in the middle of what you're reading/doing/watching. The screensaver provides suggestions is all. That's it. And there's a very tiny window underneath the carousel that suggests content similar to what you're reading/doing/watching already. I actually like it...because I might miss something otherwise. It's very non-intrusive (is that a word?) and I have no issues with it.Ease of set up is amazing as always.

Took 5 seconds to connect. The young lady was helpful and courteous, and answered my question (downloading a prime movie to my HDX for offline viewing) quickly. Turned out that the movie I was looking at was not licensed for that yet, but they were working on improving the selection of these things. Kind of a bummer, but it's day one so I expect the content to grow. For now I have several seasons of kids shows and my tv shows ready for viewing whenever we need them!Mail App:I have had some issues with the mail app, I can't get it to include all of the older messages from different folders other than the inbox. I may be asking mayday again, we'll see.This is my favorite tablet size for most general uses, not a work tablet, but a great play tablet. I hope you like it as much as my wife and I do!**Update: I was able to side load the Outlook.com app. Fixed all my mail app issues! :)", "Date": "October 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "blue/purple edge", "Author": "Guillermo D.

It has a very sharp screen, it's very easy to use, and the price is right. It's the best tablet to consume Amazon content (along with the larger 8.9\" Fire HDX tablet) and one of the two best 7\" tablets for the price (along with the Google Nexus 7).At the end of the review, I compare the HDX to two other tablets you might be considering, which are the newest version of the Kindle Fire HD and newest version of the Google Nexus 7.If you own the previous version of the Fire HD and are thinking of upgrading, the two main differences are the HDX eliminated the HDMI port and added the ability the download some Prime movies and TV shows. If you are happy with your Fire HD, unless you really need to download movies and TV shows, I don't think there are enough improvements in the HDX to warrant buying it.The Fire HDX is primarily designed to use content from Amazon, like videos and books. If you have a Prime membership, you also have access to all the free Prime videos, many of which you can now download, instead of only streaming them.  However, Amazon's app selection is weak. So make sure you check that the apps you want are available from Amazon before buying this tablet.SETUP - Some people have complained about having difficulty setting up some of the older Kindle tablets. For me, the setup of the Fire HDX was quick and easy. It only took a minute or two to get going, then I entered in my Amazon account information and I was good to go. No problems at all.SIZE AND WEIGHT AND HOLDABILITY - At 7.3\" x 5.0\" x .35\", it's one of the smallest 7\" tablets.  At only 10.7 ounces, it's light enough to hold for extended periods of time. The back is a hard rubber, which is rubbery enough not to be slippery, but not so rubbery that it's mushy.SCREEN - The HDX has a 1920 x 1200 screen. The quality of the screen is as good as the 1920 x 1200 screen on the Nexus 7, and better than every other 7\" tablet I've tried.  I especially appreciate the ability of the high-res screen to show small text very clearly, which is helpful when browsing the internet.I like bright screens, but the HDX screen was actually too bright at 100% brightness. So I turned it back down to a brightness of about 75% which is bright enough without being too bright.The only problem I have with the screen is that it is very reflective, easily the most reflective tablet I've ever used. The reflections are the worst when the screen is mainly black, which happens often because the main screen of the tablet is black. I eventually figured out that if you angle the tablet slightly away from you, or slightly toward you, much of the reflection is eliminated.SOUND - The speakers are in the back. I would prefer them in the front. In any case, even though the sound is going away from you, the speakers are still loud enough. The sound quality is decent, but nothing special.WI-FI STRENGTH - The Fire HDX has two Wi-Fi antennas which are supposed to give it better Wi-Fi connectivity than most other devices that have only one antenna. I walked around my house with the HDX, the Nexus 7, and two cell phones and the HDX usually had one more bar of signal strength than the other three devices did.When close to my router, all the devices were able to load websites at about the same speed. When I was much farther away from the router, the HDX had a slight speed advantage.ON/OFF BUTTON - The On/Off button is on the back of the tablet on the left side. It's located pretty close to where I put my hand when I'm holding the tablet.  I have already accidentally turned the tablet off three times. Really annoying.When I'm trying to turn it on, it's quicker to turn the tablet over to find the On/Off button.  I think that having the On/Off button on either the front or the side, like most tablets do, would have been much better.Some tablets and smart phones have an On/Off button that needs to be held down for 1 or 2 seconds in order to turn off. Not this tablet. Hit the On/Off button accidentally for even a tenth of a second and it turns off.The volume button is also on the back, on the right side. That didn't bother me as much, because I don't need to change the volume that often. And even if I hit it accidentally and make the volume go up or down, that is a lot less annoying than accidentally hitting the On/Off switch and turning the tablet off in the middle of reading a book or watching a movie.DOWNLOAD AMAZON PRIME VIDEOS - AWESOME!In my opinion, this is the best thing that Amazon has added to their new HDX and HD tablets. In the past, if you wanted to download a movie or TV show, you had to buy it. But now you can download some Prime movies and TV shows and watch them when you aren't connected to the internet. They stay on your tablet for 30 days, at which point Amazon deletes them whether or not you've watched them. (If you have already started watching it, and you try to watch it away from a Wi-Fi connection, you only get another 15 days to finish watching it before it gets deleted.)Be aware that Amazon has not secured the download rights to all Prime movies. In fact, only about 30% of the Prime movies I wanted to download were downloadable. But there are still plenty to choose from. Also, quite a few TV shows that are a few years old can be downloaded for free.The internet at my house is somewhat flaky, always seeming to cut out for a minute or two right at the most exciting part of a movie. Now, whenever possible, I'm going to download the movie to my tablet, and then watch it from the download. That way, I never have to worry about the streaming being interrupted. So I don't find the new ability to download Prime videos only useful on the road. I will be using it at home as well.EASE OF USE - I think that Kindles are the easiest tablets to use.  The top row on the home screen has options like \"Books\"  \"Music\"  \"Videos\"  and \"Web.\"  Even if you've never used a tablet before, as long as you can read, you can figure it out.Amazon is making a big deal about their new Mayday customer service that will bring a live person onto the screen of your Kindle HDX to teach you where things are and how to use the tablet. It's an interesting idea, but I don't think most people will need it. This tablet is pretty easy to figure out by yourself.BLUETOOTH - The HDX has Bluetooth and it works fine. I don't know what else to say about it.SPECIAL OFFERS - If you are worried that \"special offers\" means you are consistently bombarded with ads, don't worry. An ad only appears one time when you turn the tablet on.  As soon as you go to the next screen, there are no more ads. (Hopefully Amazon doesn't change this down the road and start bombarding me with ads.)PARENTAL CONTROLS - There are a few different ways parents can restrict their kids' use, like limiting them to a certain amount of time, or restricting certain categories, like video games for example.APPS - On a Kindle, apps should be spelled \"oops.\" As in \"Oops, there aren't very many of them.\" Right now, there are about 1 million Android apps, and on the Kindle you can only get about 10% of them.I know some people think \"10% of 1 million apps is still 100,000 apps which is plenty.\" Well, that depends.  Let's say an app that is really important to you, like the app for your bank so you can do banking through your tablet, isn't available on the Kindle. If you thought it would be available, but after buying the HDX you find out it isn't, you probably won't be too happy.So double check Amazon's app selection before buying this tablet.OTHER DOWNSIDES - The HDMI port that existed in the previous Kindle HD no longer exists.  (I say \"previous\" because the current Kindle HD also doesn't have an HDMI port.)  The HDMI port was useful to show videos from your tablet on your TV. Instead of using an HDMI cable, the Fire HDX now has the ability to mirror your tablet screen to Miracast enabled TVs and devices. I don't have Miracast anything, so that isn't helping me. Adding Miracast to the tablet is fine, but I would have liked to also have an HDMI port.There is no SD card slot, so there is no way to expand the memory after you buy it. Which leads into the next thing which is how many GB of memory you will need.16GB vs 32GB vs 64GB VERSIONSI downloaded several HD videos at the highest HD setting (there is more than one HD quality setting) and they took up about 1.7 GB of storage per hour of video. I realize that other HD videos may be a little more or less GB per hour, but using 1.7 GB per hour as a rough guide, here is the maximum amount of HD video you can download:16GB  (10.9GB available) - 6.4 hours32GB  (25.1GB available) - 14.7 hours64GB  (53.7GB available) - 31.5 hoursThe worst standard definition videos I found took up 330MB (which is .33 GB) of storage per hour. So multiply the hours above by 5 to get an estimate of the maximum number of hours of SD videos you can download. Once again, this is a just a rough estimate, because other standard definition videos may take up a little more or a little less MB per hour.FIRE HDX vs FIRE HD  (THE NEW HD, NOT THE OLD HD)The HDX is a fraction of an inch smaller and 1.5 ounces lighter than the HD. The difference was so small that it didn't really matter to me.The Kindle HDX screen (1920 x 1200) has a higher resolution than the Kindle HD screen (1280 x 800). With movies and books I couldn't tell the difference. Both tablets looked equally great. The only time I noticed the difference was browsing the internet. Trying to squeeze all, or most, of a web page into a 7\" screen makes the text pretty small, and the HDX did a better job than the HD of making small text very crisp and easy to read. Although I must say that the HD was still pretty good.The HDX has a camera and microphone and the HD doesn't. Even if you don't plan on taking photos or videos, the lack of a camera and mic means you can't do any kind of internet calling, like Skype, for example.The HDX has the new \"Mayday\" feature which lets you contact Amazon customer service right from the screen of your tablet. The HD doesn't have this.The HDX has a faster processor. I didn't notice any difference between the two tablets while reading books, watching videos, or browsing the internet.  The HDX is probably better than the HD for playing video games. However, since I'm not into video games, that's something I didn't try on either tablet.The HDX comes in either WiFi or WiFi/4G versions, while the HD only has a WiFi version.Some people think that only the HDX has the ability to download Amazon Prime Videos, but actually both tablets can do that.FIRE HDX vs GOOGLE NEXUS 7  (THE NEW 2013 VERSION)The hardware is similar. Same screen resolution (1920 x 1200), about the same weight, and both have a camera and a mic.The Nexus 7 is taller and narrower than the HDX, which makes the Nexus 7 slightly easier to hold in one hand. (By \"one hand\" I mean with your thumb on one side and your 4 fingers on the other side.)The Fire HDX has a faster processor, but I didn't notice a difference in speed when actually using the tablets. The Nexus 7 has both a rear and a front camera, while the Fire HDX only has a front camera. The Nexus 7 has GPS and the Fire HDX doesn't.But I think that the most important differences are what you can do with it.The main features that the Fire HDX has that the Nexus 7 doesn't - The HDX has the Mayday customer support feature and the ability to download Amazon Prime Videos.The main feature that the Nexus 7 has that the Fire HDX doesn't - The Nexus 7 has all the apps in the Google Play store, as well as GPS.So you'll have to decide what's more important to you. Amazon Prime Videos in general and the ability to download them in particular?  Or the ability to use every Android app that exists as well as GPS?CONCLUSIONThe Fire HDX is a very good tablet. It has a great screen, it's lightweight, and the price is right. All its missing is GPS, a camera on the back, and about 1 million Android apps.Why did I buy the Fire HDX? Well, I already have a very nice Android phone, which has a camera on the back and GPS. I always have my phone with me, so if I need to use GPS or an app, I do that on my phone. I don't need GPS or a bunch of apps on my tablet.I bought the Fire HDX because it's better than my phone for watching videos, reading books, and browsing the internet. Throw in the fact that I can now download lots of Prime movies and TV shows, and I'm happy with this tablet.But before buying this tablet, or any Kindle tablet for that matter, you should make sure that the apps you need are available on the Kindle. There are a number of important apps, such as apps from Google, apps from banks, etc. that you might want to use. The other major Android tablets, like the Samsung Galaxy tablets and the Google Nexus 7, have all those apps, while Kindles only have a fraction of them.If you want a high-quality tablet for watching videos, playing music, reading books and magazines, and going online, this tablet will work fine. But if you want a tablet that has unrestricted access to every app out there, you'll have to look elsewhere.", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Purple edge screen, resizing issue and apps", "Author": "T S \"8bit\"", "ReviewID": "R2DX6ZZZ7318J5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "OK, the Kindle HDX tablet is faster, thinner and meaner. Its interface is much improved over the previous generation. Yes, it has great sound and great picture.Now, here are the reasons that I think that I'll return the HDX.1) Purple hue on the edge of the screen when reading books. There are a lot discussion about this on the product reviews and it is true. Personally, the color becomes so distracted that I no longer enjoy reading from the device.2) Resizing issue. When you enlarge the display (in email or browsing), the device does not do auto-fit to or wrap the text to next line. This is very annoying, as you have to slide back and forth to see the full text. This is not the case with other Andriod device or phone. For me, it is unacceptable that I have to keep my finger on the screen, almost all the time, sliding it back & forth, left & right to see the whole content of an email or a web page.3) Amazon app store still is lack of common apps that user take for granted.

In my mind the fact that that the screen flaw is most apparent when using the Kindle as an e-reader (one of it's marquee features) points to a critical failure in Amazon's QA process for this device.  Frankly, Amazon should be embarrassed.I debated between exchanging the device and returning.  For my sake and Amazon's I've decided to return it.  I don't want to go through multiple exchanges to find a screen without this flaw.  Also, reports of Amazon's customer service rationalizing this screen defect as \"normal\" puts a bad taste in my mouth because it reminds me of all the rationalizations and backpedaling Amazon went through with respect to the very real issues the first generation Kindle Paperwhites had with defective front lit screens that had green/pink blotches.I'll consider repurchasing what is otherwise a great 7 inch tablet when Amazon officially acknowledges the screen issue as a defect and confirms that it has rectified the problem either in software or in the manufacturing process.tl;dr version -- Amazon claims the Kindle Fire HDX screen is the best available.  With the blue/purple haze around the screen border issue it's not.  Not by a long shot.", "Date": "October 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "UPDATE! Magazine subscribers - you CAN buy this Kindle", "Author": "Mark Bail", "ReviewID": "R1M26265LB668Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "UPDATE!Upon posting my original review (maintained in its entirety below), I was contacted by Amazon's Customer Service. Cody wrote me an email and tried calling twice as a follow up.  He was able to demonstrate that I could keep my magazine collection on the new Kindle HDX (Solution: once the magazine is downloaded, press and hold the issue until a pop-up window appears.  Select \"Keep\" and the issue will be kept indefinitely).  I now have my complete collection of PC magazines on my HDX available when needed.Prompt customer service can change a bad situation into a good one, and in this instance that has happened.  The original review was posted on Sunday and Cody had responded on Monday, the following day.  As a loyal customer, I appreciate the effort by Amazon to provide quality customer service.  I know it's not cheap.As a result, I have changed my rating from two stars to four.  If I could bifurcate my rating, I would give customer service five stars and the HDX four.  Specific to the HDX, the battery life seems to be shorter.  I only get 2 days of mild usage, whereas I could go 5 with the original Fire.  It also has some idiosyncratic features I'm not certain I like (e.g., using the camera to automatically power on if the cover is opened, which would impact battery power), though I have not been able to investigate whether this is an option that can be toggled off.Thank you, Amazon, for your excellent customer service.I hope this helps.ORIGINAL REVIEW: Magazine Subscribers BEWARE - I recommend you NOT buy this KindleORIGINAL RATING: ** out of 5For anyone not planning on purchasing or subscribing to magazines or newspapers, you can skip this review.  But I strongly feel I need to let potential buyers know that Amazon has implemented an arbitrary cap on the number of magazine issues you can download to your Kindle: two.TWO!!I own the first generation Kindle Fire and when I originally purchased a magazine subscription, it informed me the Fire would keep 6 issues and then begin removing them as new ones arrived (I actually have 8 on the Fire right now).  I understood the original Fire only had 8GBs of storage.  I reasoned, 'Amazon is limiting the number of issues because of the limited storage space.'  I got it.  In fact, when I purchased the HDX I bought the 64GB version (the max available) so I could maximize the amount of information I could carry.  I should mention I bought the 7\" HDX, 64GB and the non-4G version.I received my HDX Friday night and by Saturday morning was downloading my magazines.  I thought, 'Finally, I'll get access to my whole library if I ever need it.' I subscribe to PC magazines which contain tips, how-tos, troubleshooting advice, software reviews, etc.  Since my friends realize I'm a PC hobbyist, I often get asked PC questions and many times I know I've read the answer, so I just need my magazines to be available to find it.  Obviously, if one of the first things I did was begin downloading my magazines, it was a major reason why I purchased the HDX.  But, I digress.As fast as I was downloading, I realized they were disappearing on my HDX.  I finally realized there was some cap to the number of issues and the default was \"two\", so all I needed to do was adjust it...but I couldn't see how.I could not believe that I would be using Mayday one day after I received the HDX, but there I was.  To Amazon's credit, Wilfredo (Mayday assistant) and Mike (technical support) were both professional and courteous.  And I believe they were equally surprised that I could only download two issues to the HDX at a time.So, as it is right now, Amazon has implemented a software cap on Newsstand (which includes magazines and papers) of 2 issues per subscription.  Why?  I have no idea (and neither did anyone else I spoke with at Amazon).  It doesn't make sense.  Could you imagine if Amazon placed a limit of 2 on everything (2 albums from a single artist, or 2 books from a single author)?By writing this I want to warn customers and I hope Amazon will see it and remove the silly limit.SO...how'd I come up with a 2-star rating?First, I don't plan on returning it (if I did, it would receive 1 star).  I will use this for more than my magazines and from the looks of the other reviews, it performs admirably in all the other functions. Per Amazon, 3 stars indicates \"it's okay\"; and since it is NOT okay to me, I can't give it a 3 star rating.  2 stars means \"I don't like it\" which right now is the appropriate rating:  with this 2 issue limit, I do NOT like the HDX - it's a horrible restriction and it needs to go.I hope this helps.", "Date": "October 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great value for the price!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R16KKIG549WA3I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "GRAPHICS DISPLAY:  In one word and considering the price for this tablet---WOW.  With 323ppi, the 7\" HDX blows away the 1st gen iPad mini and even the latest iPad Air and is on par (within 3ppi) with the upcoming iPad Mini Retina and matched evenly with the Nexxus 7.PERFORMANCE:  This one is fast.  I have a 4th gen iPad that stops/slows down during certain games.  Not with the Kindle HDX.  No slow down or crashing at all.  I can wiz through the menus, the web, and within apps and entire experience is fast and responsive.SIZE/WEIGHT: Admittedly, I would have preferred a display closer to 8\", but the 7\" size is definitely not much of a sacrifice, considering the feather weight of this tablet and ease in wrapping my hand around the edges of both sides.VIDEO:  It was probably the new option to download some Prime video content for use when not connected via Wi-Fi that influenced me most in my decision to buy this latest generation of the Kindle Fire.  Not every video has this option, as it's my understanding Amazon is working to secure permissions from the various movie studios, but it's available on enough content right now that I had no problems finding several movies and TV shows to download for use when not connected.  Plus, the integration of video content with IMDB is neat. I bought a 32GB unit, mostly in anticipation of downloading Prime video content for use offline.  if you plan to download much content, I would urge you to consider either the 32 or 64GB models, as 16GB fills up fast, especially if downloading HD versions of movies and TV shows.AMAZON EXPERIENCE:  If you are entrenched in a lot of the Amazon universe---Prime, Kindle, Audible, and Amazon MP3 music it makes for a beautifully integrated experience.  In addition, the Amazon App Store contains most of the biggest, most popular games and apps that can be downloaded and used on the Fire.  Granted, not every Android app found on Google Play is available in the Amazon App store, but for me personally, the ones I use on a daily basis are there.PRICE:  When considering the technical specs and user experience, you'd be hard pressed to beat the price.  I purchased my Kindle HDX last week and then yesterday when Amazon announced 15% off special,  I logged into Amazon. com and chatted with a rep and they happily applied the discount retroactively to my order, so got my 32GB HDX for $228.65.  I fully expect Amazon to do something similar around the holidays to entice more sales.WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE? Amazon gives you a 30 day return window, so if you're on the fence about this, I'd say go for it and see how much you like it.  If it's not for you, Amazon has one of the smoothest, easiest, fastest return systems I've ever dealt with.WHAT ABOUT THE BLUE TINTED EDGES?  It does exist...but it has absolutely no impact on my viewing pleasure.  I read my Kindle content via a black screen with white lettering, because it's easier on my eyes, so I don't even see the tint when reading which is where I have heard the majority of complaints.  I can see it if I look hard on a web page, but for me it just doesn't register.  Your mileage may vary and that's why you have a 30 day return policy.BATTERY LIFE: I'm getting about 6-7 hours of use per day while connected to wi-fi and with streaming a few hours of video & several hours of online game play. It could be better, but I'm able to do what I need to on a daily basis and I just charge it nightly, or after heavy use. It seems to be a little slower charging though than last year's Kindle Fire HD, so overnight charging is best.DISCLAIMER:  I enjoy tech, but I am by no means overly attached to any one manufacturer or OS.  Personally, I own an iPad 4th Gen, Kindle Paperwhite 1st Gen, Samsung Note 3 mobile phone, and now a Kindle Fire HDX.  I love each device for what I use it for, regardless of whether it's Apple iOS, Android, or Amazon.

The picture is amazingly clear and sharp.  This screen puts my first generation KFHD to shame!  As an Amazon Prime subscriber, I'm able to download Prime videos instead of just streaming them, which really comes in handy when I'm away from WiFi.  There's a huge selection of t.v. episodes available for download, and you can choose which picture quality you prefer (the higher the quality the more time it takes to download & the more space it uses).  I find that the videos use up a lot of storage space but you can easily delete them once viewed.The pictures that I downloaded from Facebook,  as well as all the screenshots I took, are GORGEOUS!  Their clarity & rich color is amazing!I feel the sound quality isn't as good as on last year's model, and it doesn't get as loud as I would like.  And that is really my only complaint.

What a pleasure this is compared to the first generation KFHD, where you just watch that circle going around and around.  This is due to the speedy 2.2GHx quad-core processor which is advertised as being the fastest processor available on a 7 inch device.I find this device extremely responsive to touch, more so than the first generation model.  You can make the items in the carousel (which is a collection of every book, app, video, and song recently purchased or accessed) literally fly by.  In addition to the carousel, the \"home screen\" (which is what you'll see when the device is powered on), allows you to place your favorite items underneath the carousel for quick and easy access.

I LOVE AMAZON. I am a big fan.  But this is a clear design flaw or manufacturing flaw.MY EDUCATED GUESS is that this is Amazon contractor manufacturing versus Amazon engineering department fighting in the background.  Since Amazon's contracting factories already produced millions, Amazon doesn't want this as a 'defect' fight in the public eye.  Amazon is taking a page from the iPhone Antenna debacle.  Remember when Apple claimed it wasn't a design flaw, but quickly redesigned it for the newly manf. units?  Remember when Amazon had a bleeding light issue with generation 1 Paperwhite Kindle?

Lipphardt", "ReviewID": "R32KOT5ABY3B34", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have several items I use to read Kindle books and watch movies on.  One was the HDX 7.  I also us a second gen Nexus 7 and iPad Mini Retina.  Often I use a smartphone, like a Note 3 or Icon.  I will compare the HDX7 to these.First is screen.  I nailing this because this is the big problem.  This is supposed to be a book reader.  But that purple/violet glow intruding into the readable space is awful.  And it does not disappear regardless of your background settings - black, amber (my favorite) or white, it's always there.  Sadly it's MOST apparent in amber, which color is otherwise the easiest on your eyes.As a video display device, for movies and such it seems much better.  I suspect it's just not as noticeable with things going on on-screen.  It's there, but doesn't seem as bothersome.  But the screen is why I returned it.  Of the devices I mention, the best screen by a long way is the Nexus 7.  It's a nice reader.  Far better than the HDX.  The iPad came in last because while screen res is fine, you cannot get a decent sepia from it.  Sepia is nearly white.  Oddly. the iPad supports that cool page turn animation while the Android and WP and even the Kindle do not.As for watching movies, I think I have to give the nod to the iPad.  Sound is good on the iPad - nearly as good as the HDX.  Make no mistake, the HDX sounds great.  I hate to be repetitive, but that damn screen really sucks.  If you read the other reviews, it gets hammered for that constantly and Amazon pawns off some lame excuse about how their great display technology is so wonderful you should be happy to pay the price of that violet glow.  Well, the display is nice in the center.  But it's no better than the N7.  So, sound and display for movies goes to iPad, plus you can download your movies to the iPad just like the HDX.  You cannot, unfortunately, watch videos on Android.  Why Amazon doesn't allow this is stupid and beyond me.  You cannot BUY movies from iPad, but that is the only disadvantage there.As for use as a tablet - the HDX is very clearly focused on use as entertainment, centered on Amazon.  There is little there that is free, unlike Android or iPad.  What is available is available ONLY through Amazon.  You cannot use Google Play to fetch apps.As far as performance goes, no quibbles.  The HDX screams.  It's very fast and smooth.  But then so are the other tabs, with the N7 being slightly slower.So, the summary.  If you were able to buy titles using the iPad, I'd say forget the HDX.  Get an iPad.  It's a far better general purpose tab than the HDX, and every bit as good as the HDX for movies and reading.  If you could WATCH movies on the N7, I'd say get that.  It has the best reading display of the three, and not being locked in to Amazon is a huge benefit.  If all you care about is consuming Amazon content and that purple hell-glow is OK with you, then get the HDX.  It's the smallest of the devices, with a slightly larger screen than the N7 (not as big as the iPad though) with good sound.  If Amazon ever gets it's head out of the sand, stops trying to convince everyone that the screen is actually OK, really it is, and FIXES IT, I will buy it again just for reading and movies.

Amazon generally has been painless in this matter, but I was surprised at the insistence of the account representative to send me a replacement.

Apps load faster and wifi connection seems better.  The operating system has been cleaned up and moves things along at a nicer rate as well.  So as for my experience, this years iteration is a good buy, and if you're looking for a tablet, don't pass this one by.For those who post about the lack of Google Play, then they should have bought a stock Android tablet.  It's that simple!  I have both an Asus tablet and HTC phone that can access Play, and yes there are more apps available there, but what are you looking for that you can't get at Amazon or can't live without?  I found that several apps at Play are only available for phones and can't be put on an Android tablet.  Not a deal breaker.One post whined about not having an office suite on their tablet. Go to the app store and get one.  There are several there, and Amazon has the top sellers available for any Android device.  Another post complained about NetFlix not being on his tablet... I downloaded it from the app store and was watching videos within minutes. Take the whiners with a grain of salt.  They only post negative reviews to hear them selves talk.  To those posters, there's not enough cheese in all of Wisconsin to go with your whine.I guess if I have one complaint about this new tablet compared to the previous 8.9, I lost the Micro HDMI port.

I already own an iPad 3, an iPhone, and a MacBook Pro. So it only made sense that I come full circle and buy the mini when I needed a smaller more portable tablet. However, while shopping around, the Kindle Fire HDX won me over.I normally breakdown the good, bad, and the ugly of the products I review. But there's really nothing bad nor ugly about the Kindle Fire HDX. So I've settled for good and not so good...GOOD~ It's affordable. I purchased this using my Amazon store card and received $50 off from their promotion. So for $179, it's $220 cheaper than its rival, the iPad Mini w/ Retina display.~ The images are clear and the colors are vivid. My husband even thinks the screen quality is better than the iPad.~ It's incredibly light. When I unboxed it, I immediately lost myself in a book for a good 3 hours. And there was no hand strain from holding the Kindle up to read for that long.~ I can buy books from Amazon directly from the books section. With the iPad, I had to go Safari, log in to Amazon, buy the book, log back out, then go back to the Kindle app before I can read the book I want.~ I finally get to take advantage of my (1) free book a month for being a Prime member.~ The silk browser is fast and the browsing experience is noticeably smooth.~ I can switch between reading and listening to the book's narration without exiting the books section.~ A ton of apps to choose from. Having used the iOS platform for so long, I was a tad concern that there won't be enough apps for the Kindle. But I was wrong.~ Very user-friendly and easy-to-navigate. If my 3-year old can navigate through the HDX with ease, then so can you.~ Decent battery life. My kids and I put the HDX through the paces when I first unboxed it. And after watching a ton of YouTube videos, reading half a book, browsing through several web pages, and listening to an audiobook, the HDX stayed alive for a good 10 hours.~ MAYDAY BUTTON! This sealed the deal for me. A 24-hour customer support rep directly on your Kindle HDX with just a touch of a button. I mean c'mon, this feature blows Siri completely out of the water.NOT SO GOOD:~ The speakers are not as loud as I'm used to. In some cases it even sounded a bit muffled. But when using headphones, the sound is loud and clear.~ The front camera's quality is not so good. It's grainy. But since I won't be using this for video chats or taking pictures, it's not a big deal.~ The app store is not secure. While my daughter was using the HDX, I got an email thanking me for an app I purchased. Good thing she chose a free app. I have yet to figure out if I can set a password every time someone tries to purchase an app. This feature is available on the iPad, not sure if it too is available on the HDX.~ In the first 48 hours that I had the HDX, my wireless connection would automatically disconnect when the HDX is not in use. So every time I tried to use it I had to log back in to the network and establish a connection. After a few times of doing this I finally got tired and hit the Mayday Button. The Amazon rep was so patient and helpful. We finally fixed the issue, I only needed to modify my router's proxy settings.VERDICT:~ BUY IT! If you're torn between this or the iPad Mini, I highly suggest giving the Kindle Fire HDX a try.

SAD BUT TRUE", "Author": "Marilyn Armstrong", "ReviewID": "R17WEBSQEGQOZ2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Amazon launched the new generation of Kindles at the end of September 2013. I spent time perusing these latest greatest Kindles. They were supposed to be pretty much the same as the Fire HD, but with better graphics, battery and sound. A few other perks like really great support and cameras front and back. Gadget junkie that I am, I resisted until December, but my Fire was slowing down. Probably from all the stuff I was doing on it. Mind you, it never stopped working but it didn't work quite as well as it had. When Amazon dropped the price by $50 before Christmas, I bought the HDX. It came with 6-month financing at 0% interest. Nice.The Amazon Kindle Fire HDX has a new, improved interface for email and the calendar is better too. I know the audio and video were technically better, but they didn't seem different to me; the audio and video on the Fire HD are super and from super to more super? Nothing to notice. I loved my Kindle Fire HD and figured I would love the new one even more. And so I did. For a day. Maybe two. The battery drained in a phenomenally short time. At one point, I was on the phone with Kindle support complaining about the battery -- and it was dropping at about 1% every two or three minutes. In about 40 minutes, it dropped more than 50%. I plugged it in before it went flat. It also drained while it was not in use -- sleeping -- at approximately 5% per hour. Reading -- not audio or video -- drained it at 15% per hour. As the battery hit less than 20%, it became unresponsive. Customer support suggested I let it drain all the way and recharge it. Which I did.Same story. It seems you can't turn off any of the apps once you turn them on except by forcing a stop. Which slows (but doesn't stop) the draining while the device sleeps, but not when you are using it. Then it just chews through the battery at warp speed.Back at customer service, she said I should send it back and try a different one, there must be something wrong with the unit. I wasn't so sure about it. I had a funny itchy feeling in my brain that the problem was NOT my unit, but a design issue. I'd been reading reviews. Too many people were complaining of battery problems. I had noticed the reviews before I bought but refused to believe Amazon would knowingly market a product not suitable for its intended purpose. If a portable device -- a 7\u2033 tablet -- doesn't have a good battery life, it's useless.The Fire HD didn't have weeks of battery life, as does a plain Kindle, but it had a solid 12 hours. Twelve hours of actual use. On the Fire HDX, you'd be lucky to get 4 hours. Nonetheless, after being assured if the replacement was unsatisfactory, I could return it, I agreed. A couple of days later, the new HDX arrived.The second HDX was worse than the first. After little more than a week, I called Amazon and said \"That's it, I'm done.\" In the meantime, in a fit of totally unwarranted optimism, I had given my Fire HD to my daughter-in-law and I couldn't bring myself to ask for it back. I wouldn't have gotten it anyhow because she REALLY likes it. So there I was without a Kindle. I could use my husband's temporarily, but not long-term because he reads too.I bought the Paperwhite -- the model with WiFi, not 3G. It arrived yesterday. I set it up late in the afternoon. It went live as soon as I plugged it in. It immediately  - at blinding speed -- connected, displaying all my books and documents sorted into the categories I'd created on my original Kindle. The Paperwhite reminded me why I fell in love with Kindles. It's a great reader. It has a few little bells (no whistles). It's light, small, easy-to-use. It has some similar design elements as the Fire HD -- a touch screen, virtual keyboard and its own light -- but retains many things I loved about the older Kindles, mainly that it is a wonderful device on which to read a book.Paperwhite is a dedicated reader, not a tablet. Flat, non-reflective surface -- very easy on the eyes. Adjustable fonts and lighting that won't wake your spouse or make you go blind. It weighs almost nothing, even with a cover. You can get inexpensive covers for it. Mine (from Fintie) cost $10. There were cheaper ones, but I liked this design and I've owned Fintie covers and knew the quality is good. I settled in to read last night and for the first time in a long time, could focus on the book. The Fire HD was a great little tablet, but it was forever teasing me away from reading to play a game, hear a tune, or watch a movie -- things I can easily do on my laptop.Perhaps this is what I should have gotten in the first place. Regardless, I cannot recommend the new Kindle Fire HDX. The battery is inadequate to the tablet. I'm really sorry to have to say this. Unless you plan to use it plugged in, charge it after every use ... nope. Doesn't live up to its PR or its predecessor.Sorry, Amazon.

However, the device goes to sleep shortly after I open the cover and fold it back! I think the sensors are somehow detecting that the cover got closed when in reality it is not! This is really very frustrating. I don't know how Amazon could sell the cover without properly testing it with the device. I guess a firmware fix is possible and I really want Amazon to fix this.2. The accelerometer sensor is not properly calibrated. Even the slightest tilt will make the display go from portrait to landscape mode or vice versa. Again not a good user experience. I have used iPhones and iPads and I really like the way the accelerometer works on those devices. A firmware fix should be possible for this too.3. The automatic brightness control setting is useless. Again the sensor seems to be too sensitive. Even though I hold the device without any movement and under a constant light setting, the brightness continuously kept changing. You just cannot use the device when the display continuously flickers.4. I configured the email app to only manually fetch the mail. When I open the app and check for mail, it consistently fails on the first attempt. You always have to retry to fetch the mail. Need a fix for this too.5. Many other issues like Silk browser not connecting to websites sporadically, unable to connect to WiFi randomly (my iPhone at the same time connects perfectly fine).6. Amazon has been slow to get the apps in the app store updated to take advantage of the high resolution display. Many of the popular apps that I downloaded still had low resolution.7. The latest software update has deteriorated battery life. Previously the battery used to drop by only 6% during the night while in standby mode. After the update, it drops by 17% for no reason!All in all, this is just a tablet that aspires to be in the top league but fails to do so.

The sepia did not make much of a difference and I can't see myself reading books with a black background and white letters.  So I have to decide whether to live with this major flaw in an otherwise fantastic product or return it and hope Amazon resolves the problem in the future.  I think I will probably return it because the prospect of seeing blue tinged pages on every book I read in the future on this instrument is a depressing thought. It also makes me sad that Amazon apparently decided with their eyes open that the negative impact of the blue LED background on the reading experience was worth the benefits to color etc. For this longtime customer it was the wrong decision.", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just what I needed", "Author": "Cris", "ReviewID": "R22HEEYU4QVBKX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own the first generation kindle fire and was happy with it  for a while, but this is in another league.

If using the kindle fire for checking mail, web browsing and reading, playing games for a short time, my battery life has been at least 11 hours as advertised.Overall for what I have been doing the Kindle Fire HDX is a pleasure to use and I'm extremely pleased.

Everything is perfect about my device minus that.  It's very annoying and I can't believe Amazon actually is stating it's suppose to be like that. Clearly not if some folks are giving it 5  stars and beautiful screen and picture. I'm disappointed. For luck I Ordered a replacement to see if I can get one that's amazing like others state but if not I might return both. I waited forever to get this and really support Amazon but they should fix the issue and ship us a new one. The haze of course is only there on the web and reading so my two main reasons of buying this device was an epic fail. If anyone hears anything further let me know.10/24/13- EDITWell, I got a replacement in the mail yesterday. I was hoping mine did not have this haze, after opening up my new unit, it again had the blue haze around the border. Very unhappy. Although the haze was not a dark and fuzzy on the new one it still is annoying. I re-read some of the reviews again what concerns me is some people are stating their device is fine and has no blue haze. I want one! I reached out to a customer service rep and made another compliant and the rep was super nice and stated she was sorry. She is going to put in a claim for me and call me back about the issue and about getting me another replacement. I almost don't want to bother because it seems like I won't win. She did tell me this was normal and the blue haze is suppose to be there but it should be very faint and not to noticeable, that the paperwhite has the same thing. She also said it's because they used blue LED lights and not white LED lights. This is suppose to really make the picture look amazing. I agree the picture is awesome and I love it, but while reading this blue light really bugs my eyes out. Is it a defeat or really normal? I don't know what to believe. Why are some devices fine and others not? For spending this kind of money I just want a device that doesn't have this blue haze. I normally don't wine about things, but I really want this tablet to work.10/27/13After a few days with the second kindle, the blue haze is not as bothersome but now I have discovered an odd situation with the battery life. I charged my Kindle overnight, in the AM it was 100% ,I did not power the Kindle all the way off, just hit the power button so the screen went black. Mind you I have owned a Nexus and Ipad and never had the issue I am about to say ... I came home that same night from work got out the Kindle and the battery was at 20%! I did not even use it. I called and the tech told me that the battery did last almost 10 hours so what was the issue, really? No one used it all day, that battery should have been 100%. I looked more into the issue and after talking with another Rep they said that I have to turn the WiFi off every time I am not using it. This seem to be so ridiculous, I have never had to turn WIFI off  with any other tablet. My husband has an Ipad Mini and his charge was at 88% after a few hours of actually using it. This Kindle just has to many issues for me, once they come out with another batch later on I will try it again until then maybe I'll try the HD. Has anyone else have this issue? Is it true you have to turn the WIFI off?", "Date": "October 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "11 hour battery yeah right!!

Allemann", "ReviewID": "R13RFVFJ44AQL8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, I am a long time Apple Fan. I own a Mac Desktop, an iPad and an iPhone. I like to use my phone strictly for phone-related uses--making calls, using the map while traveling---that sort of thing. It is just too small for watching movies, playing games and such. But I wanted a small 4G LTE tablet of some sort that was light and would easily slip inside my purse. I wanted one that I could take with me when I traveled out of town, made road trips with my hubby, or when I'm killing time waiting for my son at his music lessons. My iPad is full-size and connected to a keyboard case, so I didn't want to keep lugging that around. So, since I am an Amazon Prime member, and after much thought and research, I finally decided on the Kindle Fire HDX 7\".At first I was concerned that I might not like it. One thing I don't care for as an Apple user is how restricted their apps are and how geared they are toward all things Apple. I was afraid that I might be repeating myself by buying a Kindle---that this tablet might be locked up in all things Amazon with no access to Google apps, youTube, Gmail, Chrome, or other apps that might not be available in the Amazon app store. However, I've found that the Kindle Fire is not locked up after all. I learned that even though there are some really great apps in the Amazon store, not everything is there that I might like or want. Yet, it was very easy to install a third party app called 1MobileMarket, and with that I have been able to side-load apps that I can't find in the Amazon app store. One app I was abler to download for example is Chrome, which of course is a Google app. It works great! I was able to sign in on Chrome with my Google account and watch all the youTube playlists and favorites that I had accumulated in my Google youTube account. I was also able to earmark Google as my search engine of choice on the Silk browser. In the Kindle email app, I was able to incorporate both my Hotmail and my Gmail accounts, and it handles both of them seamlessly. While I'm on the subject of side loading, another app that you might want to download right off the bat is the free app ES File Explorer. It's a full-featured file and app manager which is similar to Finder on a Mac or Windows Explorer on a PC. It's been really valuable in helping me find and organize apps and games, etc. after I've side-loaded them to my kindle. I highly recommend this app before you get started with side loading.Now on to my music collection. I have a ton of songs that I've already placed in my iTunes account and I didn't want to have to buy them again in order to listen to them on my Kindle. So by using the (free) Amazon Cloud Player and the (free) Amazon Music Importer, I was able to upload all the music that I had put in my iTunes account to the Amazon Cloud. The next time I turned on my Kindle Fire HDX, then went to Music, there were all my songs right there for me to listen to and/or download to my Kindle. I then found a really great feature within the Music app. It is called x-ray. I found it by accidentally pressing it as I was listening to a Diana Krall song. While I was listening to the song, and when I pressed the x-ray icon, up on the screen came the lyrics to the song, following along with Ms. Krall as she sang (similar to karaoke words streaming on the screen). When the next song came on, the lyrics to that song came up on the screen. Cool! The sound is amazingly strong for such a small tablet! As is the video display. And speaking of videos, I have several instant videos that I've purchased on Amazon, and they display and sound beautifully on the Kindle Fire HDX! I also have several videos on my Mac computer, and by using the free app Android File Transfer which I had downloaded onto my Mac, I was able to connect my Kindle to my Mac with the USB cord, and simply upload those videos to the Kindle library storage.Day by day I'm learning more and more about my Kindle and how fun and easy it is to use. But on the second day after I had bought it, I ran into a problem while trying to get into the app store. I couldn't figure out how what to do, because I couldn't get the App store to open. I just kept getting a black screen. So I pulled down the Kindle menu from the top, found and pressed the Mayday feature and within a matter of seconds, a young man with headphones on popped up on the screen and asked in a friendly voice, \"Hello! How may I help you?\" I told him the problem, and then watched my screen in amazement as he opened the necessary screen, forced closed an app, and then got me into the app store. Within moments he fixed the problem right before my eyes. So impressive! (By the way, although you can see them, they can't see you---in case you're wondering)One problem that some have mentioned, is the blue/purple haze around the edges of the screen when one is reading an ebook on this Kindle. Yes, I guess it is there, now that I looked for it. But I really don't find it to be a distraction, because it is very slight. However, you have three different page color settings to choose from that might help if this really bothers you. You can choose to have your book pages be white with black letters, sepia pages with brownish-black lettering, or black pages with white letters. Since I prefer the black pages/white letters setting (as I mostly read at night), the faint purple haze around the edges of the book pages aren't an issue for me because it simply doesn't show at all under the black color. Speaking of the eBooks section, many (most?) of the books have a feature on them called Text to Speech. While reading a book, you simply tap on the Play icon, and the book becomes an audio book, and you can listen as the book is read to you while you go about doing other things.So to summarize, I am a long time faithful Apple user, but I have to say that I am really liking my new Kindle Fire HDX. Don't let the negative reviews keep you from trying this little amazing tablet out for yourself. For all the \"problems\" that I've seen mentioned here and there, there's none that are really an issue (in my humble opinion) as you get to know your Kindle Fire. I can honestly say that the more I learn about this little tablet and all the wonderful things it can do, the happier I am that I took the plunge and bought it!", "Date": "April 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "My new favorite toy", "Author": "asortafairytale", "ReviewID": "R3701V3BUK0UM0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this about a month ago and wanted to give myself some time to play around with it before writing this review.Let me just say, I'm really enjoying it. It's the first tablet I've ever owned, so I can't compare it to anything else, but I am really enjoying this little toy. I've downloaded and listened to a couple of audio books while driving to and from work. I'm addicted to a few game apps that are eating up WAY more time than they should, but that's what they're for, right? I also have the Weather Channel app that I check each morning before I get ready for work.One of my absolute favorite features is the quality of the screen. I have the Netflix and Hulu apps and the screen is so freaking amazing. So crisp and clear. Honestly, it's better than the screen on my laptop. I still use my laptop for laptopy things - creating Word and Excel documents, or going online if I need to have multiple browser windows or tabs open/do multiple things at once.

I'm not a huge fan of reading on a backlit screen. I have a Kindle Keyboard that I much prefer reading on.

Something that looked nice, didn't cost too much, and had some good reviews. I had no idea this sleek,little, black tablet would become one of my favorite electronic items in the house.I had used a relative's older Kindle HD off and on, so thought I had an idea about speed and what to expect.  Nope, wrong.  The new 2.2GHz Quad-core Snapdragon processor is blazing fast.  Tapping on an app, and it opening, is near instant, HD movies play seamlessly with stutter and pixelation being an extreme rarity. Web pages load quickly, and the touch-screen is responsive, yet not so sensitive you will accidentally open an app by brushing against it's icon.The button placement and size, to me, are ideal.  With the older Kindle, it was easy to think you are pressing volume, but would be pressing on/off.  Not to mention they were tiny. The power button and the volume buttons are on opposite sides on the HDX. Mine is in a case, and neither button has accidentally been depressed.If you are looking for a gorgeous screen with vivid detail and color, the Kindle HDX is impressive.  The 1920x1200 display handles HD content with ease, ebooks are crisp and clear; it really is stunning. Additionally, the black level rendering is superb for such a small unit. Brightness can be set manually or you can let the Kindle adjust it automatically based on lighting conditions.Located on the back are two speakers and there is also a mini-jack in case you want to use headphones.  For as thin as the HDX is, the sound quality is good.  While the speakers cannot compare to a Home Theater, they reproduce sound clearly and with little to no distortion, even at maximum volume.Battery life has been more than adequate for my needs, yet I have noticed that how long it lasts can vary depending on usage.  For example, I started off with the battery at 100% and streamed movies for four hours straight; it was at 70% at the end.  Conversely, I played a popular game on it for 30 minutes, and the battery went from 100% to 82%.  Every time I play it, I know to expect a 10% draw in about 15 minutes.  Also, any app that uses a lot of memory or constantly runs in the background can affect battery life.  A Memory Manager can help turn off apps in the background and prolong the battery.My normal usage consists of heavy email, medium amounts of web surfing, lots of reading, and a few hours of streaming, mirrored to the TV.  Adding it all together probably equals between 3-6 hours per day.  The lowest the level has been was 33%, and that was after using all day and forgetting to plug in at night, so it stayed in sleep mode until the next day.Below I will address some concerns that seem to be common:1.  Dropped or poor WiFi Signal-- I have had this happen only three times in three months of ownership.  Once, was due to the router needing to be \"flushed.\" The second time, I cleared the cache in the Kindle, and the third time I have no explanation, but a simple rebooting of the HDX fixed the issue.2. Blue glow around the edges-- If I had not read about this, I would never have noticed it.  The only time it is visible is on an all white background, such as an ebook.  However, to me it is very faint and neglible unless you are focusing solely on the edges.  It is due to the edge lighting using the blue LED's and using the auto-brightness or manual adjustments should minimize impact.3. Screen Flicker-- This does happen on occasion, yet only with certain memory and color-intensive apps.  Every time it has self-corrected within a short period, and have never experienced it when streaming a video or movie.4. Ads-- I did not pay extra for no ads, but do not see them as a problem.  They only appear on the lock screen and do not interfere with performance.  Additionally, you can view them all on one page and sometimes a special buy will show.  If you absolutely do not want ads, the payable option exists.5. Laggy/Slow performance-- As with any computer device, the cache can become full and should be cleaned regularly.  Anytime my Kindle HDX seemed slow, a simple cleaning remedied the issue.  One note--certain apps can affect performance and I recommend checking after installing various apps to see if they hinder the device. The cleaner I use is Clean Master and it also acts as a memory manager.6. No Google Play--It is true that you cannot download from Google Play, however, there are other reputable android sites that you can use.  Youtube and the Web have plenty of resources to help.  You will need a File Manager, which can be obtained in the Kindle Store for free.  I use File Manager Free along with 1MobileMarket for any android apps not available in the Kindle Store yet.7. No Youtube-- I use Youtube all of the time on my HDX, whether through Silk or through the app on my Bluray Player.Some other Features and Benefits:1. I have three email accounts synced with my Kindle HDX.  It makes it very easy and convenient to turn it on and have instant access to all of them at once.2. For me, it is preferable to not use the carousel.  I appreciate that I can just swipe upwards and have all the apps I put on my home page arranged cleanly just like desktop icons.  Additionally, by holding an app and dragging it to another you can create \"folders\" to customize the appearance.  For example, have all your games in one  folder icon, all of your productivity apps in another, and so on.3. My Kindle HDX can control two cable boxes, my bluray player, my AV Receiver, act as an independent cable box, stream movies with Amazon Prime and Cable On-Demand.  Once the Home Theater is on, all I need is the Kindle to control all of it.4. Using the Netgear PTV3000, an app, and the Kindle HDX has eliminated the need for me to have a cable box for each TV.5. As time goes on, I keep finding more uses for the HDX.  It is amazing how much this small tablet can do at a fraction of the cost of others.6. It is an incredible e-book reader and library.  I love how convenient it is to have so many books in one place and be able to take them wherever I go.The Kindle HDX has become the most-used computer in the house. It does everything I initially wanted and much more and is still working great after three months. If you are looking for an incredible value in a tablet, then I definitely recommend it.

I like all the other options of things you can do with it, even if I don't think I need it at the moment.

This one is missing many of the latest and greatest apps that are on the Apple App store and Google Play (including Time Warner App, some banking apps, big mobile games)etc...The Amazon app store is currently estimated at 75000 apps while both the Apple and Google App stores are each over 1 million apps and have many dedicated specifically to the tablet (specially the Apple App Store)2- Buttons placement of On/Off button and volume Up/Down are horrible and size is way too small for my normal sized hands.3- Although it is smoother than the last Samsung Tab 2 I've used, the interface still feels a bit clunky at times. It's not butter smooth like the IOS on the iPad (believe me, even my iPad 1 was smoother than this)4- Apps crashed too frequently, even when going in the prebuilt Shopping and App store apps5- Needs better quality control. I understand this is probably the first batch of the tablets and usually every first few batch of a gadget have some issues but I really think better quality control would alleviate most if not all issues. My HDX has some screen flashing as if the backlight is getting adjusted up and down consistently. Also, I have a dead pixel that is quite noticeable in the middle right side of the screen.", "Date": "November 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great while it lasted....:-( Hopefully will be reunited soon?", "Author": "forney", "ReviewID": "R2V6LZB4JHSCLY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So I caved in with the 15% recently given off and decided to upgrade my first generation kindle fire.First impression...WOW, this blew the first generation away by far.

Sometimes, when time permits, at my Job it can be pretty mundane, fixing pdf links etc in abobe; So I can now just downloaded comedy central stand up right on my fire (FREE WITH PRIME) and im pretty much LOL'ing all over the place...(I think my co-workers think I am mental :-))......this is seriously fun and a nice lunch break activity (Try Nova, its awesome)with the downloadable vids.Sadly after two beautiful days my fire at 50% died and wont turn back on....contacted customer service and it was confirmed I got a lemon. After a 40 min conversation with amazon, they are sending me a new fire with 2 day shipping.  A little disappointed about them not expediting it with one day...I mean I was seriously like a little kid at Christmas playing with it non-stop, it was/is a great improved experience when comparing to my 1st gen.  Hopefully my second tablet will be free of any quality issues.  I understand ALL electronics, even apple products, have lemons so I will update this review upon further review.  I am just sad at this inconvenience and was wishing for 1 day shipping or a credit to the app store....I mean this is why im a prime member after all (hehe :-))On a last note I got the 64GB fire and Im glad I did.  Downloading HD content takes up ALOT of space OK a 48min episode of Intervention takes up a little over 3GB.  Thankfully there's multiple downloading options that could make the great HD 3GB video into a fine 720 experience making this same file at around 1GB.My advise...  1) Wait for another promotion Christmas is around  the bend and I would be surprised if they don't offer  another 15% day.  2) Splurge on the highest storage that you will need (compared to apples storage upgrade cost 599 for a 64GB mini Ipad when after tax mine was 278 with the 15% discount ($356 difference including sales tax)  3) If you have rewards with a Credit card use them (makes me feel better when making purchases like these with \"free money\"  4) Pretty much accept the fact that for the next week or two after you receive your kindle (If its not a dud) your mind will be blown and you will have no life other than with your new fireThat's all for now....and that's my 2 cents...if your on the fence try it...with amazon prime its AMAZINGoh and I forgot #5)...If you cant stop drinking the apple juice why bother buying the hxd and then posting a 1 star review because its not an ipad...its meant to be a media device and really excels at this...seriously if you fit into this category Stop it, its annoying and that's being really kind at bestHave fun, be kind and enjoy life :-)", "Date": "November 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Tablet, Not So Great An E-Reader", "Author": "Makeever \"mackeever\"", "ReviewID": "R15B5Y73FOZHTQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "In comparing this to my 2012 Kindle Fire HD: it's a much faster and better tablet, but I was disappointed in the e-reader.

This is the first time that I have been unhappy with my purchase.I traded in my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 in order to \"upgrade\" to this model only to learn that the key feature that made me love the Kindle Fire so much has been removed by Amazon. Previously, you had the option to enable text to speech within just about any Kindle Book. It was quite convenient to click on the \"play\" button while in a book and hear the device read to you as your eyes move down the page. Quite an immersive experience! To take it a step further, you had the option to purchase the professionally narrated audio book (if available for the title) and take the experience to a whole 'nother level. Now, the only option is to purchase the audiobook to enjoy the same functionality. In the interest of full disclosure, with the HDX, you have the ability to turn on text to speech from the system settings, but then the Kindle reads EVERYTHING that displays on any screen, meaning websites, menu settings, etc. That is extremely annoying!One other thing that really bothered me was the screen issue that many are reporting.

Faster, smoother and better than earlier versions", "Author": "John Williamson", "ReviewID": "RALWCKMXLE1DZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Each generation of the Kindle Fire 7\" tablet gets better than the previous iteration, and this one is no exception. It is not revolutionary, the way that the 1st generation Kindle Fire was when it was introduced in September 2011, but it's a great example of good product evolution.Picked up the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" during one of the December promotions after seeing the 'Try Risk Free' sidebars on the product page. Within the first day, knew that it wasn't going back, as it has exceeded my subjective expectations. Mine is the Wi-Fi version with 16GB memory, and I picked this one based on prior experience with earlier versions. Right out of the box it was easy to see that the engineers had done their homework and listened to the users of the prior models. As an owner of the first generation Kindle Fire and then the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" tablets, it becomes quickly apparent that this one has most of the features we have been looking for since the first models.This will be a detailed review, so for those who just want the key points, will list them followed by a more in-depth look:\u25c6 Likes:+ Excellent 7\" HDX display; 1920x1200 (323 PPI), exact color accuracy (100% sRGB)+ Super-fast 2.2GHz quad-core processor; Snapdragon 800 with Adreno 330 GPU+ Long battery life; up to 11 hours, 17 hours when reading; charger included+ Updated Fire OS 3.1 \"Mojito\"; has Goodreads integration, Cloud Collections and more+ Lightweight; about 10\u00bd ounces (Wi-Fi model); excellent ergonomics+ Dolby Digital Plus audio; optimized according to task+ 'Mayday' button; online tech support in 15 seconds or less+ Front-Facing HD camera; good for those into selfies+ Dual-band, dual-antenna Wi-Fi; excellent connectivity+ Silk Web Browser; cloud-optimized, faster than older versions+ One-year limited warranty & service; excellent from past experiences\u25c6 On the Fence:\u00b1 Angled microUSB connection; may take some getting used to\u25c6 Dislikes:- None encountered\u25c6 Opening the Box:The Kindle Fire HDX arrived quickly, within two days of ordering, and it was well packaged. Within the flip-lid box was the new Kindle Fire 7\" HDX tablet, a USB 2.0 cable, a 5W power adapter, and a Quick Start Guide. I immediately plugged the unit into the charger to make sure that the battery was fully charged, then turned on the power.From the first moments it was obvious that the HDX was much faster than the previous versions, but it was the sharpness and response of the screen that really stood out. Had read numerous online reviews prior to ordering the Kindle Fire HDX where so many were raving about the 1920x1200 high pixel density (323 PPI) display, and they were right. The color accuracy (100% sRGB) is faultless, and admittedly even better than my earlier Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" that has been service for over a year.It weighs about 10\u00bd ounces, so it's light enough to carry day to day without adding much weight to what you normally carry. The overall dimensions are 7.3 x 5 x .35 inches, making it easy to hold in just one hand. It may be too large for a pocket, but will fit easily into your briefcase or bag. Found that is slipped easily into my camera bag, a personal necessity.\u25c6 In Use:First impressions are one thing, but it is the actual usage that counts. Most of the apps that I had already been using popped up smoothly when the HDX was turned on, and the improvements with the Fire OS 3.1 \"Mojito\" upgrade were apparent. On the home screen, the contents, books and apps in Carousel View are easy to access, and the new Quick Switch aspect allows a side swipe gesture to easily move between multiple apps or individual content items without navigating home.Had ordered mine with Special Offers enabled from prior experience with the HD, and this one is actually smoother and better. And admittedly I ordered a sleeve case from one of those deals at a decent savings.As far as Wi-Fi performance goes, I have had no issues as this model has a dual-band, dual-antenna built in. I've been able to move around from one room to another with no signal loss. Using this tablet in hot spot enabled locations is easy as well.\u25c6 Using the Amazon Appstore:The Appstore is often perceived as a third-tier marketplace in the mobile space, due primarily to the fact that Apple's App Store and the Google Play marketplace are so large. But the Amazon Appstore has been quietly growing and posting some major titles in many categories, allowing users to find almost all of the more popular apps they would find elsewhere. As you explore the Appstore, check the reviews for whatever category appeals to you, and maybe do some experimenting. My focus with my Kindle Fire HD and HDX is more toward productivity and photo apps, but I'll list a few to perhaps help.The very first app that I downloaded on my new Kindle Fire HDX was Lookout Security & Antivirus (Kindle Tablet Edition), as any device that goes on the Internet can be hit. First used on my Kindle Fire HD over a year ago, it has proven to be a best in class utility, and it's a highly recommended 5-star freebie.There are a number of popular apps already loaded on the Kindle Fire HDX if you explore a bit. You'll find the Internet Movie Database (IMDB), Yelp, Goodreads, and of course the Kindle e-reader app. In addition, you'll find utility apps, productivity tools, games, entertainment apps, and most of the big social-networking services.For business and professional users there is the LinkedIn app, and for general social networking you'll find Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and more. There is no `official' YouTube app available for the Kindle Fire HDX, but YouTube videos do play in the Silk browser, and streaming-music apps and services are plentiful.There is very little that the Kindle Fire HDX cannot handle; it is surprisingly fast at everything. There is currently nothing available on the Amazon App store that can make it break a sweat, from what I have observed.\u25c6 Movies and Videos:You can download videos from Amazon Instant Video and watch them offline, which is unique to the HDX series. Rotate the screen and you will be surprised at how quickly it reorients itself. Flip it over during an HD movie and the HDX doesn't even blink. If you are not already a member, taking advantage of that free Amazon Prime trial is worth it, particularly with this tablet, if just for the videos and movies.The other Prime features are good as well: free two-day shipping and a free e-book each month. Try it out, but don't get hooked if you want to avoid paying $79 a year. For me it's proven to be worthwhile for years, and now with the video free trials, even more than before.\u25c6 Mayday:The 'Mayday' button is Amazon's free online tech support, where they have publicly committed to providing live support in 15 seconds or less; 24x7, 365 days a year. Based on prior experience with previous devices, had fully expected to give it a try, but the HDX is so intuitive that it was unnecessary. Thought of coming up with some obscure question to ask, but every time I looked for something, the answer was right there in front of me. As an interesting note, there were a number of online tech journalists who had reported that the Mayday tech calls had averaged a nine-second response during the Christmas season. Impressive, to say the least.\u25c6 Summary:Looking at this review, I've had to edit out a lot of random observations, and at this point all of them are positive. As noted earlier, I have encountered no negative points with this device, which is a rare thing. There are some features that I will never use, such as Kindle FreeTime Unlimited. This is the innovative all-in-one subscription that offers games, books, educational apps, movies, and TV shows for parents and kids. For those who have children this is probably good, but mine are grown.I have owned this device for less than a month, so expect that updates will be posted as I find them.The Kindle Fire HDX 7\" is quite fast when it comes to most tasks, and the screen is spectacular to say the least. It has excellent battery life, and there seems to be a 40-50% increase in longevity during times when you're reading in the Kindle app. The Silk browser is fast and easy to navigate, and it would be pretty hard to screw anything up with its use. The Dolby Digital Plus audio is excellent, and the good quality speakers combined with the first-rate display make the Kindle Fire HDX well suited for watching videos and playing games. The Wi-Fi version that I picked fits my needs, quite well, but keep in mind that there are other models that may be better suited to your personal needs and location. Bottom line: the Kindle Fire HDX is a 5-star device, and is the best that Amazon has offered to date.JW \u25aa 12/31/2013", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worst Customer Service Experience of My Life", "Author": "Jeffrey hubbard", "ReviewID": "R3DY6GOGW9WK5C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After spending the extra money on 2 day shipping and being assured by the customer service rep that the product will arrive in two days I ordered the product... flash forward to five days later the product finally arrived, but that is where my real troubles began.

I tapped the power button a couple times not response I held it again, so on and so forth for about 5 minutes until it sprang to life and relief flooded across my body. This relief was short lived through because only 10 minutes into having the product on after going through all of the initial set up the screen went blank. I called up kindle support and was transferred around about 3 times before I found someone remotely competent. They went through some steps and determined that my brand new out of the box Kindle was broken already! they said they were going to express ship the product. When the shipping information appeared on my account it said that it would be shipped in 4 business days, I don't know about you but 4 days is about double what should be considered express shipping. But I patiently waited, on the 4th day when it hadn't arrived I called the shipping company and they explained the estimate was wrong and it will be taking 5 business days to receive the product which just added to my excitement. When the product finally arrived I was pleasantly surprised that it turned on much more easily. Well pleasantly surprised until I tried to register my device. When I tried it would not let me register it, yet again I wade neck deep into the sea of incompetence that is Amazon customer service to find out that because they do not know how to properly ship a product and it took longer than 2 days to be received they went out and on their own reported it lost or stolen which is essence bricked my kindle. the process of reversing the problem took over an hour and was the worst hassle on the phone I have ever had.

I've used others in the past, and I never could get past how slow they operate; however, Kindle Fire HDX is an exception. While I'm not familiar with other operating systems, I will say that Fire OS is very smooth. I will admit there were some bugs while working the device. For instance, I have run into a few occasions where it has crashed and restarted. I have also run into situations where I've had to reinstall apps for them to work properly again. In time, I'm sure they'll fix these issues with updates.With respect to the apps that are available for this tablet, you'll might be disappointed. I'm more of a gamer, so going onto Amazon to find out that some of the apps I wanted aren't available to the Kindle yet. This is rather unfortunate, considering a number of these apps have been out for quite some time already. Basically, Amazon doesn't have the same broad selection you would typically find in the Apple Appstore or Google Play. Though it might be common knowledge, apps from the Appstore or Google Play aren't compatible with the Kindle. On the plus side, Amazon does release a free app each day, so that makes developing your collection easier.I've also tested some of the new features that came with the Fire OS 3.1 upgrade, including second screen and Miracast. Second screen allows you to take movies and TV shows from Amazon, and lets you play your selection wirelessly on a nearby television, assuming you have either a Playstation 3 or 2013 Samsung TVs connected. Bear in mind that second screen is only available to amazon content, nothing from netflix, hulu, or any other online streaming services. Ironically, TV Sideview (Sony's app that allows you to control Sony devices from your tablet, including the PS3) isn't compatible w/ the Kindle either. As a result, you'll have to navigate your system on both your controller and the Kindle, at least until, and this is assuming, TV Sideview becomes available for the Kindle.Miracast is a much better version of Second Screen, as this allows you to wirelessly display what you're doing on your kindle onto a nearby television or media streaming device, as long as it is Miracast compatible and compatible with your Kindle. For those of you who have familiarized yourself with Chromecast, just a heads up: it's not compatible with the Kindle. I ended up using the NETGEAR Push2TV Wireless Display HDMI Adapter - Miracast and WiDi (PTV3000) (link provided below) to test Miracast, and I have to say that if you want to use your Kindle to stream content onto your TV, this is the way to go. It displays in HD, the sound quality is superb, and anything you do on your kindle can be placed on your TV. **Gamers, if you're expecting to play games in this fashion, bear in mind that there is likely going to be lag time between the commands you input into the tablet and the miracast compatible device. This doesn't affect anything other than games, however, as the sound and video output on your TV will be synchronized during use. Thus, if you want responsive controls, I don't recommend miracast for gamers.There was one more update that came with Fire OS 3.1, and that is Goodreads. Unfortunately, I'm not too familiar with it. All I know is that it's an amazon app that allows you to share what you've read, provide recommendations, and look at what your friends and other people are reading. Readers, you'll probably find this resourceful. I know some of my friends love it.Overall, the Kindle has the power and graphics to provide you with a great quality experience; however, the selection of apps do pale in comparison to other devices. While it's not perfect, it still provides the same functions you would find in other tablets (some of which are better). If you have to have all of the latest apps, especially the ones that accompany big games, such as GTA V and Injustice (Which has been added since I 1st wrote this review. Still took them most of this year though.), you'll surely be disappointed.Helpful tip for closing apps on your Kindle Fire HDX:Some of you might not know how to close apps on your Kindle, and a number of pages on the web recommends force stopping apps to close them; however, that could damage the data. Assuming an app doesn't have an option to exit the app, just use the back button on the main screen of the app. If the app doesn't allow you to exit that way, then the developers never developed an exit button for their app. Then you'll have to force stop it to keep it from running in the background and avoid eating up some of that precious CPU usage. Hope that was helpful! It might've been common knowledge, but I would not know, as this is my 1st tablet ever, as mentioned previously.To use miracast for your Kindle Fire HDX and television, I recommend:NETGEAR Push2TV Wireless Display HDMI Adapter - Miracast and WiDi (PTV3000)B00904JILO", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Prime video download a joke", "Author": "Patriot1", "ReviewID": "R3MLJ9YWG0SFQP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I upgraded to the HDX for three reasons.

I am very disappointed and am in conversation with tech support. First, the good: brilliant color, speed, much improved speakers, and the button placement is ideal for on/off and volume. \"Mr. Hyde\" appears in the reading, at least on my device, in a slowly-advancing glowing blue border! I know- the notice has gone out that this is \"normal\" and part of the advancement in true color display, but my device border is irregular, blotchy, and prevents any enjoyment of reading despite adjustments of brightness, font, etc.Amazon customer support is stellar, but I've had some difficulty conveying the fact that this display is unacceptable.

Since then I've owned the following: Google Nexus 7 (original), Amazon Kindle Fire (original), Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7\", Motorola Xoom (original), HP TouchPad (WebOS fire sale), PanDigital Novel 7, few generic Chinese eBay (all of which sucked BTW), Barnes & Nobel Nook HD+ (still have, gave it to my mom when I ordered the HDX) & now the just released Amazon Kindle Fire HDX 7\" 32GB.Honestly I didn't know what too expect with the HDX, all the specs were awesome & it's kicking serious butt against the Nexus 7 (2013) in various benchmarks, but I was still kinda nervous. I knew the HDX would be high-quality & well made, Amazon doesn't put out anything, but well made devices.It arrived yesterday, it's a lot smaller than I thought it was going to be, but the difference is the HDX doesn't have all the wasted space usually found in the bezel areas of most tablets, it's minimalistic in design. Very much a welcomed change!By reducing the wasted bezel space, Amazon has not only made the tablet lighter, it's very easy to hold in one hand.The true full 1080p HD display has blown me away!!! I have never seen such clarity, vivid full spectrum extremely accurate color reproduction, flawless crisp clean & incredibly smooth video. Honestly, no matter what I say, this is one of those things you have too see to fully appreciate. There is no blurry, pixelated motion distortion you find in some HD TV's.Combined with true Dolby sound, which somehow manages too reproduce a very life like surround sound experience. I haven't figured out how the HDX pulls this off, but the sound is phenomenal.You definitely notice the quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor under the hood, as this thing flies!Amazon's re-built from the ground up newly minted Fire OS 3.0, is a work of art. It's fast, very user friendly, gorgeous graphics & integrates very smoothly with the content available from Amazon Prime. You can easily find anything & everything you may be looking for.Amazon's app store is rapidly catching up to Google Play & I have been able to find all the apps I use from the Google Play store.The integrated apps, such as e-mail, calendar etc. was surprisingly easy to setup with my Gmail & Google Calendar.Amazon has most definitely hit a massive homerun with the HDX line. Apple & Google have serious competition this time around.Don't second guess yourself if you are considering the HDX, it's an absolute no regret purchase. You will absolutely love the HDX. And YES, the HDX really does have the best & highest quality HD display currently available.After seeing what the Snapdragon 800 CPU & Adreno 330 GPU are capable of, I now see why Google is using both in the upcoming Nexus 5. I will definitely be buying one of those as soon as it's released as well!Awesome job Amazon!!!", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Disappointing", "Author": "pixels rose \"Pixels Rose\"", "ReviewID": "RHBEFB4HNQYTB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this for my 7 year old and it worked fine at first but now it keeps freezing up and we can't turn it off or anything it just freezes on whatever she was doing playing the music on and on can't even power it down until the battery dies wouldn't recommend this product.", "Date": "February 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire- not worth it", "Author": "K.

I explained this to the tech advisors and they told me to send it back. Amazon tells you to call them because a kindle requires special shipping and of course the customer service rep on the phone was a nightmare. She didn't understand a word of English, she made me go through her checklist of trouble shooting, even though she had a record of me speaking with tech service. She couldn't comprehend that I could not complete her troubleshooting checklist because the device was not working! She only sent me the shipping label because I got angry at her for spending so long on the phone with me and we were getting nowhere.Amazon sent me a new kindle. Now that I can actually use the screen I can see that the device isn't worth it. The opening screen has ads, which I discovered I can pay to remove. I tried to sync documents to my kindle and I followed the website's directions, downloaded the android transfer app to move the documents from my computer. Nothing happened. I called tech service and the first thing the guy tells me is that the kindle doesn't use android. Why would amazon link the android download to their kindle support page if kindle doesn't support it. I asked him how to put PDFs on my kindle and tech service told me I had to email the documents to amazon so that they would convert them for me. He didn't solve the problem that I still can't move documents from my computer to my kindle.I am so frustrated with this device. I can't sync music, I have to be a full amazon prime member (I'm only a partial member) to rent books and I can't remove content (offers) from my dashboard that I don't want there. I called customer service AGAIN and asked if I was eligible for a refund and they told me that because this was a replacement device I could not have a refund.

So a little background on me, I work internationally and bought three KF HDX 7\" for my three daughters.  One of the main reasons I got them the tablets is so that they can Skype with me while I am out of the country.After an hour of troubleshooting with the tech rep (which was probably the fastest response I have ever gotten from technical support), we were able to get Skype going in the parental section of the tablets.  However the plan for me is that the kids will never be in that section of the tablet.  I have subscribed to the Kindle FreeTime App and this is the only additional app that I have added to this section.Another two hours with another tech rep, and I am still not able to use Skype while in the FreeTime mode.  Currently the problem is being escalated up to another level of tech support.  This very issue is common on all three Kindles that are sitting in front of me.Other than this one issue, I would have to give the tablet a clear 5 star as it is as described by Amazon.  And with tech support like they are offering, the other tablet manufacturers had better watch and learn.Edit:  Got a call from Amazon Customer care and it seem that their engineers are aware that Skype is one of the Apps that conflicts with the settings of the FreeTime environment and as such causes the App to crash.  There is supposed to be a fix being worked on here in the near future and released for wide distribution.  In the mean time I guess I will just keep to skyping on the PC.

I do pay for Amazon Prime membership as well as Kindle Freetime Unlimited for kids.Ok, with that out of the way, allow me to share with you my impressions:Device layout/Handling-----------------------WEIGHT: It feels really light! I measured on my digital scale which showed 10.6oz (300g)VOLUME CONTROL: I actually like the volume up/down on the back where my right fingers can conveniently adjust without losing grip. If these buttons can be re-mapped, then racing games will be at another level with \"paddle shifters!\"POWER BUTTON: I am neutral on its location (left rear). Users can get confused with volume buttons on the other side. Also, once the Origami case is put on, there would not be a need to hit the power button at all since opening/closing cover will do the job automagically.Display/Audio--------------TEXT: very sharp - can see the difference with its improved pixel density. Not sure it'll help improve the reader's vision, but certainly it is very pleasant and easy on the eye. Almost as pleasant as Kindle Paperwhites, but with color!VIDEO: I side-loaded a 1080p movie clip, and it looked real good as it should. Most people will not put big 1080p movies with 16-32GB storage. Downloaded 720p HD videos are fine, but they won't blow anyone away compared to similar tablets on the market.GRAPHICS: very smooth and clean rendering with no lag for fast action games like Real Racing 3 and Asphalt 8. Icons for Apps, movies, and music albums all look sharper. The only negative I found with such high resolution is some older color kids books are image-based, so a full page on older Kindle Fire now look tiny on the HDX display.AUDIO: Very impressive stereo fidelity! I can hear the pleasant difference compare to the Fire HD, but may not be as loud. Sound reflects nicely when laid flat on my kitchen counter.CAMERA: only front-facing camera which looks fine with proper lighting. Nothing breakthrough here. Maybe someday there can be a nigh-vision camera as part of the x-ray feature set...LOLBattery Life--------------STANDBY: full to drained in 4 days - just under 100 hours with email and notification check once a day.ACTIVE USE: I got past 6 hours of web browsing, listen to music, and watching videos before I had to retire (approx 50% juice left)Software/System----------------STABILITY: no hang-and-reboot has occurred so far. This happened a few times on my Fire HD. The pad is warm to touch after a while but not hot.WI-FI/Bluetooth: works well like the Fire HDs.X-Ray: Music lyrics is very cool and I love it. This feature shows up on many of the MP3 albums purchased from Amazon. Usefulness in Kindle books depend on the content. Movies? Works like having an interactive blu-ray session, which I don't find it as useful. As expected, my personal uploaded music are not \"x-rayed\" for lyrics.QUIET TIME: Saw \"Quiet Time\" button next to \"Mayday\" and didn't know what it is, so I pressed \"Mayday\" to find out. Quiet time is to \"mute\" notification and others that cause audibles, but does not mute the sound from music, games, or other apps.MAYDAY: got a male operator within 15 seconds. He did require me to verify my email address, name on the account, and billing address. I asked him how would my kids be able to use this feature when I issue them the new Kindle HDX?  He said \"good question\" and will pass it on...So just a heads-up that the operator will need certain info.SILK: Browser runs fast as is. This is NOT always the case with Fire HD, where the browser can crawl like a turtle unless the \"Accelerate Page Loading\" is turned off. So looks like the developers fixed this to perform as advertised. I hope that will give Fire HD's software an update also.Summary--------For Kindle users: The HDX is a good incremental upgrade to Fire HD. The major improvements underneath don't surface as much for general users. But for owners of the first generation Kindle Fire, upgrade to HDX is significant.For non Kindle tablet owners: Kindle devices greatly enhance experience with Amazon's offerings with e-books, music hosting, instant videos, magazines, and especially for Prime members.

Wertz \"Imautobot\"", "ReviewID": "R1EQCALRS6SF8F", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I really really wanted to like this Kindle.  I bought it as a upgrade from a 2012 Google Nexus 7.  This was a mistake.At first I did this because I am a Prime member, and an Amazon device is really the only way to get access to the streaming video on a tablet, or the lending library option.  However, these additional options do not make up for what I lost.  By this I mean, I can't (easily) get any Google apps installed on the device.  If you want a legitimate version of any Google product, or many other Google play apps, you cannot install it without a side-load situation.  My problem with that is that apks are then downloaded by non-store sites, this means they might be out of date, or even hacked.  I chose the path of least resistance and just sent it back.  I've got better things to do with my time that hack a product right out of the box.  While this means you don't get access to the actual G-mail app, Google Earth, Google+, and YouTube, the loss that hurt me the most was the inability to install Chrome.  Chrome has all my bookmarks, and I had little desire to painstakingly re-enter all those into the silk browser.The hardware is nice, the interface runs smooth, and the high res icons that consume the better part of the main menu are surprisingly beautiful.  However, I found it annoying that under those icons, you'll be force fed amazon purchase suggestions based upon on what icon is centered.  I bought the Kindle without the \"special offers\" for a reason, so this subtle solicitation bothered me.Ultimately the Kindle feels only slightly less locked down than an iPhone/iPad, which is exactly the same reason why I don't buy those Apple products.  I want my device to be free to get apps from multiple (legitimate) sources.  And I want that functionality to exist out of the box.  It's interesting that my Nexus 7 can easily get the Amazon app store installed, but the Kindle could not easily have given me access to the Google Play store.I ended up replacing this with a Nexus 7 2013, which lamentably has a slightly slower processor, but at least I'm not in for any of these proprietary surprises.  Maybe I've just been spoiled by my other Android devices.If Kindle allows Google apps to be able to be installed through a front-door option, I would gladly revisit the Kindle hardware, it is still a nice piece of equipment.", "Date": "November 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Kindle yet -- a superb tablet and ebook reader", "Author": "Michael E.

Movies, print, and pictures are very impressive.Speakers are impressive, a near surround sound experience when watching movies.Easy to consume Amazon products.Con'sApps, their are not many apps available.Apps locked up several times requiring a complete reboot of the device.Kindle Free Time has a very limited selection and does not feel justified for the price.Regarding applications failure. I loaded several language learning applications from the app store, Babbel, Duolingo, Learn French Deluxe, and Busuu. They ALL eventually locked up and required a reboot. The device appeared to completely lock up and I held the power button down for quite some time.ConclusionThe Kindle Fire HDX 7\", HDX Display, Wi-Fi, 16 GB is a great device if you plan to only consume Amazon products. It has some room to mature here, such as more intuitive searching for products on amazon.com. But I would grant this device a 4-5 stars for that experience.Regarding apps, it was only a 2 star rating. Smart devices are all about consuming any type of content on demand. With the several different apps failing the Kindle Fire HDX 7\", HDX Display, Wi-Fi, 16 GB is not yet there.

No unnecessary features attached to the browser. Just bookmarks, HD video, and fast surfing.Videos/Audio/Apps:The Kindle Fire HDX has a Dolby Digital Plus audio engine which allows for the device to separate the background noises from the person speaking or the music. At full volume, I find this hard. But, with the speaker placement on the top of the device, sound is very clear and loud, even with a case. And with a 1920x1280 resolution at 323 pixels per inch, this is right below the Apple iPad Mini 2 at 324 ppi. But, chances are you will not even notice it. Graphics are amazing for games like Asphalt 8. Downloads for videos and movies do not take an hour, unlike my iPod Touch 4. Yes, the Amazon store may be small, but it has its share of cool apps, including Skype built in (on the Cloud; I'm getting there)Amazon Cloud:Ah yes, the Amazon Cloud. Lets say you bought a load of books on your Kindle Paperwhite. Already on your Kindle Fire. You just have to click on \"Books\", download it (which takes a small amount of time) and there: you got your book onto your Kindle Fire HDX.Same for apps and all that stuff. When you get on your Kindle, you already have Skype, Yelp, iMBD and the Oxford Dictionary. Just have to download and you have Skype on your HDX. You have free, automatic and unlimited cloud storage. iCloud can only claim free cloud storage of up to 5 GB. There is also Amazon Cloud Player, which means you get to listen to your Amazon music on your computer.Special Offers:Not disturbing but helpful. I find myself using these for app deals and videos on Prime and stuff like that. Yeah. It is not intrusive or boring mostly. But it is something I would NOT spend money to remove.Home Screen Layout:With the carousel and the drag down screen thingy, I find it helpful for display but not much else. I like the organization at the top with categories such as \"Books\", \"Apps\", and \"Games\".Customer Service:I like the immediate protection of May day but have not used it. The service on Amazon.com is very helpful in fixing my Kindle Fire. By the way, if your kindle ever gets frozen, just hold the power button for 20s and the Kindle automatically turns off. No important info is lost.Reported Problems:The blue haze \"problem\" is present, but it does not affect me at all in a bad way. When I see it, I find it hilarious and just keep playing/watching. For all the people hating it, DEAL WITH IT.Buttons are on the side, but you just have to feel around for them.Charging is slow with the USB, so Amazon recommends the PowerFast charger.Apps crash a lot: Watch out. Just a minor problem.I RECOMMEND THE FOLLOWING: Buy the 32 or 64 GB version (5.32 GB is used by the device already) with WiFi- adding 4G LTE is +$100 to the price and Special Offers included.

I still have about 15 apps on my Iphone 5s that I would really love to have on my HDX but are not available on the Kindle app store. Also the same apps that I have on my Iphone 5s and on my HDX 7\" not all work the same, some features are missing. I would also like to be able to customize my HDX like I do my Apple products, backgrounds, wallpapers, ect.The Amazon cloud and the Iphone cloud app are amazing for syncing photos and documents from my mac and Iphone to my HDX the only problem I am having is syncing my contacts and calendars from my mac and Iphone to my HDX. I have not been able to do so or find an easy way to do it that would always sync without having to manually input one at a time. The emails all sync without any problems (@mac, @comcast, & @gmail) but I still have to get use to the Kindle email and play with it some more before I'm really comfortable.The Amazon Prime membership is the way to go, I actually cancelled my Netflix and saved $100.00 a year. They have a great selection of movies and TV shows and if you want to watch something new its very reasonably priced. You can also borrow books and get 2nd day shipping.Overall I give the HDX 2 thumbs up and will keep it. I will definitely keep my Iphone and Mac's but when it comes to tablets I am confident to say that Kindle is the way to go. The few things that I don't have or can't do on my Kindle are things I can live with and I always have my Iphone and mac and will be able to do them.

Her iPad was just too big and heavy to carry around.  The picture and video clarity is awesome.  And, even though it won't accept Flash, Amazon has their own experimental streaming player that works pretty well with our cable service, so she can receive streaming movies and tv-shows.  As an e-reader, the print is crystal clear, and the \"pages\" are nice and bright, which is a major improvement over the original \"newsprint\" looking Kindles.  The built-in automatic battery-saving feature, when using the e-reader feature, is also a plus.  The main disappointing feature is the camera.  I guess I assumed it would be like the camera on the iPads, but it isn't.  There isn't a lens on both sides.  While the Kindle HDX does take pictures and videos, you have to turn the screen away from you to do so...which makes things a little difficult.  It appears that the primary reason for the camera is for using Skype.  Also, one thing that would have been helpful is for a PDF version of a FULL instruction manual to be downloaded right on the Kindle desktop.  As it is now, you have to go online and read through a list topics to try and find answers to questions....or use the Mayday Button.  There is a PDF manual online, but it is only a Quick Start manual.  So, there are many new features that the new HDX has, that we are actually discovering by way of the TV commercials for the Kindle HDX.", "Date": "November 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Long Time Apple Ipad User Amazed by Kindle HDX That Costs a Third As Much", "Author": "Pod", "ReviewID": "R3BOWQ0UMNGPF2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love the HDX.  I got it on special for $154 and at that price it's a freaking bargain.  I am a  longtime Ipad user (Ipad 2 and more recently Ipad Air) but I was looking for something more portable I could take on my subway ride to work and I didn't want to drop $400 for an Ipad Mini.  What really sold me on the HDX was that I could download free content from Prime and then watch that on the train and I would be able to use the device as a very portable reader.  I was expecting a significant downgrade from my Ipad Air in performance but have found myself blown away by:1. Feel:  The device is light, well built and has good tactile feel with a grippy, rubber like backing.  I bought a case (10 bucks) which was fine but I really liked holding the device without protection so I ditched it.2. Picture:  The picture quality for videos is amazing, far surpassing the Ipad Air's (or any other display I've seen):  I downloaded and watched (for free) an episode of Justified and was noticing slight blemishes and beads of sweat on people's faces.  The images are simply beautiful.3.  Performance:  The HDX is snappy with no lag whatsoever and very intuitive functionality. I was even able to side load a nook app and other Google Play apps in a matter of minutes following easy instructions on line.4.  Browser:  Silk is very quick and easy to use and works like Chrome (which can also be sideloaded but I prefer Silk)5. Customer Support: The Mayday function is revolutionary.  I have never waited more than 30 seconds for help and every rep has been friendly and competent (and native English speakers).  They have walked me through the necessary steps, drawing and highlighting on my unit, and even provided additional tips and suggestions.  Like others I had some issues with dropped WI-FI signals but the Mayday rep downloaded a WI-FI manager for me that maximizes the signal strength from my router and I haven't had a dropped signal since then, about a week ago.  One Mayday rep I spoke to said they spend a lot of time helping folks with basic non-HDX-specific functions on third party apps like Facebook or email like posting pictures or attaching documents.  The Mayday reps are also Amazon generalists and can handle customer service issues as well.6. Cloud storage: This was something I wasn't even aware of when I purchased the unit but copying photos from my Mac and music from Itunes into the Amazon cloud and onto the device was easy and free (2GB for photos and 250 songs).  I also have all my Nook books on the unit which I didn't know was something I could do.In summary I am very impressed with my HDX.  It's a very capable, inexpensive little device.  It won't replace my Ipad use at home but it's perfect for commuting and travelling places where I don't want to carry a larger device.  I have since purchased one for my mom for Mother's Day.  I originally purchased the Fire for her but the Mayday button would be so helpful for her, particularly with everyday functions like how to use Facebook, that I returned the Fire and upgraded to HDX.In brief response to comments from some of the the other reviewers: it is true that the universe of available apps is smaller than on Google Play or Itunes.  That's not really Amazon's fault and most Google Play apps can be side loaded with third-party software. The critical apps are all there.  Also, as other reviewers have noted, the HDX can drop WI-FI signals.  As discussed above, Amazon is aware of the issue and, according to the Mayday rep I spoke with, is working on a fix to be released with the next software update.  In the meantime, the third-party WiFi manager the rep downloaded onto my unit has worked perfectly.", "Date": "May 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Dissapointing technical support", "Author": "Larry Sassaman", "ReviewID": "R2I5UIE6Y91PM2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased the HDX in early Dec. 2013 and until last week was very pleased with the Kindle's performance.

However, this HDX is also much slower in downloading books, etc.  My original Fire can download a book in seconds, whereas this one takes many many minutes.  I'm not sure why.  I have to say if I only had one Kindle I would keep my original Fire and skip the HDX.  I don't see many advantages to it other than the camera and definitely many disadvantages.

I wanted to experience Android - and this Kindle is Android with Amazon's \"skin\" on top.  I considered a Nexus 7, but customer feedback worried me about it being possibly too fragile.  Price on the Kindle HDX was hard to beat - and the features -screen, and CPU and memory are front-line.What prompted me to write a review?  I bought the Kindle 16GB, WIFI only version- and have been using it about 4 weeks. Tonight I set my 4G iPhone up as a Personal Hotspot - and hooked up my Kindle to the Internet, using the Apple iPhone's WIFI broadcast.  Speedtest showed the Kindle at 5.79 Mbps download, and 10.57 Mbps upload -I was very surprised at the speed it achieved and that upload measured faster down download!Tonight, I also started Pandora, and synced the Kindle to a little bluetooth wireless speaker, and got some great sound.  The Kindle's internal speakers are good on their own (and 2x better than the Nexus 7 if you listen to them side-by-side).  I've found all of the apps I've wanted (Evernote, myfitnesspal, flipboard, feedly, skydrive, zillow, lastpass, and others in the Amazon store -I also sideloaded a couple of apps, a virus checker and maybe 3 or 4 other apps - can't remember which ones right now).  Tried Google Chrome on the Kindle, and I find that it really isn't any more stable (in my experience) than is Silk.  Synced all of my e-mail contacts in from Google to my Kindle Contacts app, and also synced all of my Google calendar entries (from Google/iOS) to a Kindle app called CalenGoo - which seem to be working to keep everything in sync both ways.  Photos I take with my iPhone are synced into the Kindle and can be viewed or edited, and they even show up in a subdirectory on my PC in the Amazon Cloud Drive. Music uploads into the Amazon Cloud have been difficult - only 1 music directory (artist) at a time (from iTunes) - something I haven't finished struggling with.  I agree there is a very faint, light blue border (mainly on the left and right side) on white pages.  If you look you see it, but it is barely noticeable, and to me at least, not the least bit distracting.  I just don't ever notice it to the extent that I remember it  - I just don't \"see\" it unless I go look for it. Its not a defect, just part of the screen illumination design.This review has been all over the place - but I just wanted to give people a hint of what is possible (and there is a lot more I'm sure). I've had a few small glitches  Sometimes the browser (either Silk or Chrome - seems too sensitive and wants to open any sidebar advertisement that I happen to slightly touch.  Scrolling can be either too fast, or sometimes just right.  I can't find a quick way to jump to the top of the screen as I can in iOS.  But, I find the Kindle to be fun, and I pick it up all the time instead of my ipad (it's too heavy) or iPhone (the screen is too small).

I really had a hard time choosing between Kindle and ipad. I knew I was getting all 3 kids a kindle fire for Christmas (a different review coming for those), but for myself, the decision was tough since I already have an iphone and feel like an ipad is just a bigger version of the iphone but it's not a phone - so part of me thought \"whats the point?\". I wanted a device to-go and mostly for entertainment and books. I have a laptop and it's not fun to lug around when really I just want something to maybe do a little work email and gaming or read on. I also travel frequently and think I can get buy with just a tablet. The Kindle was my first. The results on it are:Music/Media:ipad would streamline all our content with my phone and itunes. If I went the ipad way I feel like we could just kinda have one system and get apple TV to rent movies on. And guess what?! KINDLE does it even better! I paid the 25.00 or whatever it was to upload ALL our 11,000 songs to the cloud and the kids and I can all listen from the cloud or download to our devices. Now I will be researching a device to stream to TV.Speed:Some games lag on this device, but I am still new to it so I am unsure if it's the device or processor, or if it's the game itself. Overall though, the selection of games has been great and free or cheapBooks:You can't go wrong with Kindle books. They are generally MUCH cheaper than apple's books, and sometimes even free! I like the screen and the ease of turning \"pages\", etc. I am still learning about some of the highlighting features, and X-ray is really cool! I just figured that out tonight thanks to MAYDAY!Another great thing! MAYDAY!I have used it twice. I was wondering if they could see me but they cant - even though I can see them.

Really useful. No googling forever, no making an appointment at the genius bar 3 weeks in advance just to ask a simple question. Just hit mayday, reach a human, and ask! And while they answer you they are friendly and may offer up info about other features you didn't know the device had.Sound:I was surprised how good the sound is! Ususally small devices have a bit too much treble or tweet or something for me. This one has even sound. You can comfortably listen to music or something on it without feeling like you need to go get the bluetooth radio. (and it has bluetooth too!) Also sounds great with Beats headphones, but what doesn't?Screen:Is fantastic. Video quality is wonderful!Battery life:Pretty fair. Doesn't last all day if it's in constant use but doesn't take too long to charge either.Now the cons:*No way to track it if it's lost like you can in the icloud, though you can call amazon and they can essentially make it into a brick for whoever finds it. I would just like to see GPS tracking so you know where you left it. Or a way to make it chime somewhere if I can't find it in the house.*Plug is kind of angled and funky, so hard to plug it into the charger in the dark. Have to angle it just right.*NO REAR CAMERA - You can only take front facing \"selfies\" with it.*Not easy to quickly \"kill\" apps if you need to.

Navigation is smoother, quicker and more animated.I have no complaints. And I'm looking forward to the new features that will be added, like the second screen and (possibly?) collections.BTW, I do see the very faint translucent blue border around light-background screens but it doesn't touch the type and doesn't bother me in the least. It's still the best reading experience I've ever had. If you have a Mr. Monk-type obsession problem (\"It's great, reading is easy and pleasant, but IT'S GOT A BLUE BORDER.\") your impression might be different.

Cordoba \"mxc\"", "ReviewID": "R3M0JZDWPQSSDE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I really wanted to like the kindle. It has a great price, awesome screen, and with an advertised 11 hour battery life (up to 17 hour if just reading according to Amazon) I figured this device was the perfect companion.After a few weeks of testing and timing, I can confidently say that for the vast majority of user scenarios, the battery life is significantly worse. In fact, I have no idea how exactly Amazon came up with the 11 hour number.But lets start with the basics pros:- Screen is really nice (yes there is some slight blue light bleed around the edges, but Amazon has a complete explanation of why that is - and it's used to have the great color accuracy/gamut that the display has). Honestly, it was very little to bother me at all, and welcome the increase color gamut. The screen is superb.- Kindle Free Time: this is absolutely great. I can let my daughter play with the kindle with some serious restrictions. (what apps can be accessed, how long she can play, read or watch videos (3 distinct timers). She can't do purchases or anything else. I can't believe nobody had done something like this before. It's really amazing.Cons- Neutered android means that a lot of very popular android apps are not available, and you have to resort to side loading them, and not all work that well. I really wish they allowed a larger percentage of the Google Play store apps (all preferred)- thick border around the edges, where the display could be extended to be even more usable without increasing the size of the device. It's around a 1.5 inch diagonal of wasted space. The iPad min in contrast his just a 1/4 of an inch or so.- And the worst offender which causes this to be a 2 star product instead of 4 stars, is the misrepresented battery life. Partner has an iPad2, (10 hour claim) and it generally lives to those expectations, lasts all day off the plug, great.The Real Battery Life of the HDX which claims to be 11 hours (up to 17 reading!!) is closer to 5 hours.Here are the tests I did during the last 3 weeks:The first day, I downloaded several apps and got it setup, read some books to my daughter, and watched a movie. I used the mayday button to ask about sorting apps by age of your child (can't be done as of now). It couldn't have been more than 4 hours, and the device was already at 10% charge (down from a full 100% charge) so I was really disappointed, and started doing a series of tests:Things to note:* Wifi only model (3g would suck the battery even more)* brightness was set to 50%.* I'm a huge fan of Amazon, and this is the first Amazon product that has really let me down with their claims. I owned a kindle keyboard, and now a paperwhite 2 - both of which I love. Customer service has always been second to none. Basically, there is no reason for me to \"bash\" this product. I am a tech person, and I am aware battery life varies quite a bit by usage, but this is a serious issue not just a small variation. Amazon failed to deliver big time on their battery life promise.Test 1:* 3 hours of mostly reading (kids books, so they had colors and things, my daughter flipping through the pages)* 1 hour of videos (she was unfortunately drawn to Barney)* Half hour of games (some simple puzzle games, nothing 3D intensive or anything requiring full use of the graphic processor)* Battery was down to 20% and I started surfing the web and others until it ran down in 1.75 hours.So basically, during a reading heavy session (17 hour amazon claim), the device failed to last 6 hours.Test 2:- Charged it overnight, let my daughter do whatever she wanted with it (using the awesome Kindle Free Time). She mostly watched videos and flipped through some books. She also opened a game or two (Again simple puzzle games, no 3D battery intensive games). She had breakfast in between and then lunch. And then brought the device to me because the battery was dead. The device lasted just over 4 hours...In contrast the iPad, where she likes to play with 3D puzzles and several other 3D apps (Mr Potato), she plays with it several days before it ever runs down.  I can confidently say that playing with apps, the iPad lasts at least twice as long as the kindle fire.Test 3:- Sporadic use throughout he day. I figure I'd try a really subtle scenario.- Light web browsing (not more than 30 minutes)- Some videos (1.5 hours)- occasional book (only 5 minute spans, or flipping through pictures)- The device was on the sleep state most of the time.- Battery life was at 30% that night. So 70% of the battery was lost during some 3 maybe 4 hours of use.I will do a strictly video test and post it later.But nothing I have seen indicates that any normal usage will get you anywhere near the 11 hour claim.", "Date": "December 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love It", "Author": "P.

The screen is amazing, which you'd expect from the stats, but for a tiny 7\" device, the speakers are actually quite capable.

I decided to google the problem and found dozens of threads with similar experiences, including people who'd returned the device and had a replacement with the same behavior.The second problem I had was that the battery would drop as much as 50% overnight when left in sleep mode. That's just not acceptable to me. Again, we had the Fire HD to compare it to and the battery drop there was only a few percent. I tried deleting applications that might be activating the device while it was asleep, a factory reset, but nothing worked. Again, I found threads on the Kindle support forums with dozens of people experiencing the same issue, including those who got replacement units.I'd suggest just buying an HD, which is what I'll be doing the next time they go on sale.

The original Kindle fire worked great and did what we wanted. While we have all the \"i\" devices from Apple, the footprint of the kindle was easier to deal with and overall it was a great product.The two HDX however have caused me nothing but frustration. One has FreeTime for my 6 year old, and the other doesn't. Let me go down some of the issues that have annoyed me greatly:#1 - The Kindle for my daughter has issues with staying connected to WiFi. It will drop connection and go into a constant state of searching for an access point. There are a total of 6 access points in my house, overkill yes, but I'm an IT guy... just goes with the territory. Going Airplane mode, Turning on & off WiFi, etc does not work. Only a full powercycle fixes the issue.#2 - FreeTime REQUIRES a password, and the only way to get to some of the kids apps is going into FreeTime. I trust my child, she is very mature for her age, she doesn't NEED a password MANDATED by Amazon. This is simply an annoyance and should be the choice of the parent.#3 - The Kindle with FreeTime also WILL NOT allow applications to be used when outside of WiFi range. It gives an Internal Service Error when trying any application in or out of FreeTime. I've researched the forums and this is a known issue which has not been adequately addressed by Amazon. I have tried every one of the suggestions, flushing the cache on the AppStore service (and one other, can't remember the name), deregistering & reregistering, reloading completely. I'm not sure what they have done to tie every app access to the app store, but this is a huge flaw and only seems to happen on Kindles with FreeTime installed (per review on the forums).#4 - Total Lockout of Google Store/Google Framework - Due to the 'pissing contest' between Amazon and Google, no Google apps can be installed. While the email app will pull your mail from GMail, you cannot load the actual GMail app, Google Maps, YouTube App, etc. You can force a sideload of an app, but it will be massively hindered because the Google Framework cannot be installed.#5 - Relating to number #4 - NO native YouTube app. My children watch a great deal of YouTube because they love MineCraft. However, because YouTube is a Google product now, they don't play nicely together. I've seen several times responses on the forums from Amazon folks saying to load one of the three third party apps which supports YouTube. Two of these are limited to only their selection of videos and have forced ads which my children don't need, and the third which actually allows access to searching (in a horrible non intuitive way) immediately started throwing up ads for ADULT WEBSITES. Great for the kids, eh?#6 - Also relating to #4, lack of access to the VAST number of Android applications which are available due to lockouts. While you can sideload after unlocking one of the settings, it still reduces the effectiveness of the applications due to their tinkering with parts of Android that truly don't need to be tinkered with.#7 - The 'Carousel' (the gigantic scrollable icons on the screen) is nothing but a history of past applications used. There is no way to keep your favorites in place, there is no EASY way to clear it. If the device was mine I would hate it as a privacy issue. Overall it forces you to use the text menus at the top more than anything else, or the search function to find applications you want to use. I personally just hate the interface.We debated long and hard between going with the mini-iPads, Kindle Fire HDX, or the various Android pads. Now that I have all of these for review, I would lean heavily towards something like my Samsung Galaxy Tab or other pure android device of quality. There are simply too many headaches totally caused by the effort to make this device proprietary and denying applications made by the developer of the OS, Google. Overall I've highly disappointed, this could have been a great product.For the Positives : Great screen, great size, better price than apple products.Once again, love Amazon as a whole... but I've tried to make these work for my family and yet my children run and get their 2 year old iPods which have tiny screens just to avoid using these.", "Date": "May 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Definitely exceeded expectations.", "Author": "Frank L.

After 2 weeks, in one day my Kindle HDX has never been below 40% and average end of day is about 65% so I've never had one day of usage as an inconvenience. For those that find charging once a day annoying, hmm, two days should still be good for most average uninterrupted use. I also ordered the Origami case as its enclosure and I love it as well. Stands the device with equal stability in landscape and portrait, and feels protective for minor drops or spills.", "Date": "April 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Goodbye Apple, Hello Amazon!", "Author": "AvalonsMist", "ReviewID": "R3AFIP9AVIHJWB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After the latest Apple operating system, Mavericks, stopped allowing me to directly transfer my data, such as my contacts, to my brand new $300 iPod Touch Gen 5, plus $59 for the tech support plan, I have had it with them.

Kindle fire uses a modified version of google's android and limits you to Amazon's appstore which is mostly a watered down version of google's play store. I would consider this a con but there are some distinct benefits of the amazon app store. The first benefit is that amazon provides you the ability to use their amazon prime streaming service along with the major apps such as netflix, plex, ETC.Kindle Fire hardware- The kindle fire has top of the line hardware for a budget tablet. The quad core snapdragon 800 has great graphics capability along with great multitasking capability. The HDX technically has a better CPU than the 2013 nexus 7 and a much better CPU than the galaxy series. The screen has great colors and decent brightness with pretty decent viewing angles.Kindle fire battery life- I believe that the kindle fire battery life is subpar when compared to my nexus 7 and my wife's ipad mini. I typically get about 6-7 hours of streaming video whereas I get about 10 hours with my nexus 7 and about 11 with the ipad mini.Kindle fire durability-  The kindle fire is the only tablet that I've ever had a cracked screen with. The screen cracked just towards the edge because I stepped on it. I don't know if this is because I'm a fat bastard or because the screen is abnormally weak. I believe it was a combination of my fat bastard qualities as well as the thinner screen. I have dropped my other tablets and I have stepped on my nexus 7 and slatebook before and they haven't broken yet.Value- No doubt the HDX has great value. The hardware and software are top notch.Which should I choose- If you are a big google supporter then I would recommend a nexus 7 or a samsung tablet. If you are strictly using it for media such as netflix and amazon prime, no doubt you should choose the kindle fire HDX.all in all the tablet is great but there are some limitations which may or may not be the deal breaker. The reason I bought it was to use amazon prime instant streaming so that I didn't have to download flash on my nexus 7.", "Date": "April 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love this tablet!", "Author": "Macy Banton", "ReviewID": "R2UUCOOFX42R5P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First I should say that I have very limited experience with tablets. Having received an HP Slate (Microsoft based tablet) at work, which I was allowed to keep when they replaced the HP's with Apple iPads (which I used for about a year).I wasn't even in the market for a tablet, but I had purchased a mobile hotspot plan through my wireless carrier (the hotspot was free with a 2 year contract) and was offered $100 off any tablet as a promotion for purchasing the hotspot plan.I chose the Kindle Fire HDX 7 and am certainly glad I did. The Kindle performs flawlessly. It has a great picture - perfect for watching MLB TV games, offers a number of fantastic apps. (I especially enjoy my talking Bible, as well as many Bible trivia/quiz apps, and Hangman).I love the Kindle library choices and also love the fact that my Kindle can read my books to me. The Kindle HDX 7 also features excellent sound, so much so that I have yet had to use my external speaker.I find the HBX 7 the perfect size for carrying around - it is light, compact, and the controls are very intuative. The only thing I was disappointed about is that the Speaktoit Assistant app is not (yet?) available for the Kindle Fire HDX. I have this app on my smartphone and find it very useful.I have on occassion used the MayDay button, and found the customer service reps. & tech support people very helpful.I should mention that my wife has the previous generation Kindle Fire HD 7 which has also performed flawlessly, and my daughter has a Google Nexus 7\" tablet by Asus - which is also a fine tablet, however IMO not quite as well thought-out as the Kindles are. In fact for my needs I prefer the Kindle HDX Fire over the i-Pad, it's that good.I originally was going to use a case with a keyboard for my Kindle, but found that the touch keyboard performs flawlessly & there is no need for an external keyboard. (In comparison the touchpad keyboard on my HP Slate does not perform anywhere near as well as the Kindle's), and with the HP, I use a small external keyboard.I've owned my Kindle Fire HDX 7 for 4 months now and find it does everything I would expect it to do and more. I am surprised at how quick this little dynamo is. Kudos to Amazon for making such a wonderful little tablet. I should also mention that it has excellent battery life compared to the other tablets I have owner and/or used.I'm a completely satisfied customer, and keep Bibles and Bible Handbooks as well as a few other books in my Kindle library, and find it wonderful to be able to store all of  these on such a small tablet. In my opinion the Kindle Fire HDX is fantastic, and I look forward to many years of enjoyment from this wonderful little tablet.", "Date": "April 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "LOVE MY KINDLE HDX!!", "Author": "Texas Reader \"Texas Reader\"", "ReviewID": "R7RYLAF37CG5W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my 4th Kindle,  and I  certainly recommend  it to anyone thinking of buying a Reader!

If you have kids and take summer vacations, this device loaded with media and a set of headphones are a life saver!The quality of images and media on this device is absolutely amazing.  If you ever wondered if there really was a difference between the Kindle Fire and the Fire HDX, as an owner of both...YES!  This screen is amazing.As far as reading goes, I would advise a Kindle paper white.  For outdoors, battery life, portability a paper white is the way to go.  The HDX is truly a media tablet for gaming, movies, internet trolling, cat videos, etc...The last bit of advice I have is to look into a Squaretrade warranty.  If you are not familiar, head to their site and you will see excellent values for protection.  The bottom line is that this is not a repairable device.

So far, I have found no way to use google hangoutson the Kindle.Skype does not allow group calls on the Kindle which is a disappointment as group calls are somethingI am used to using. I hope that Skype will change the app for Kindle to allow group calls in the future.I have added the spare phone app which allows me to use the Kindle like a phone. This is only possiblewith having already set up a Google Voice account ahead of time. The calls are very clear and are free to anyplace inthe US and Canada.I added Calibre Companion which links to Calibre on a regular desktop so that you can share books between Calibreand the Kindle. I already had many books on the Calibre so moving them was easy with the Calibre companion.I added Adobe Reader which I prefer over the Kindle reader. I added Kingsoft Office which allows me to create documents,presentations, and spreadsheets.I also added Easy Voice Recorder which works well and is easy to use.In also added ES File Explorer, It was suggested as a way to side load apps thatAmazon doesn't offer.I added Espson print plugin to print from the kindle using a wireless printer.I added Drop box.I wanted the Kindle primarily for the ability to communicate using various means such as gmail, skype, phone, google voice etc. Since communication is my primary use of the the kindle that it has a fast operating system is much appreciated.Second I wanted to store e-books and audio files on the Kindle.

It became my little 7 inch companion everywhere I went. I did everything I asked of it with little complaint. I could work with Gmail, Calendar, Gvoice, and Good docs. Yes, most of my stuff revolves around google for the same reasons so many out there are also tied to the google eco system. I ported my number to gvoice and found it an excellent decision in this world of constant texting slowly replacing talking on a cell phone. All this and play games, rdp into my servers, check stocks, check bank accounts, and track my daily mileage. Everything I needed.This year I purchased the Amazon Kindle HDX 7, an awesome little tablet in every respect. It's extremely fast compared to my old Nexus 7. The screen is absolutely stunning. Games are extremely smooth and everything just works perfectly. That is, except anything that has to do with google. Here's where the HDX leaves me placing in the corner to use only for games or watching videos. Yes, it has an email client but I don't really like it much. There are no other email client choices (yet) for this thing. The calendar is very blah. Google voice apps are non-existent in Amazons store, youtube - forget it. Yes it does Netflix also.Hardware-wise this thing kicks butt. On the software front I totally understand Amazon needs to steer the crowd towards its own content, especially considering the cost hit of the HDX. I'm sure they are losing money by selling us these tablets if not making peanuts on the hardware. Their hope it to hook you into their ecosystem obviously but that leaves us google users having to find other options when it comes to keeping a single tablet with us. Example - I really do love my HDX tablet but I don't bring it to work with me. Instead I continued using my old Nexus 7 for the daily routine. The real odd thing here is that having access to google services on the HDX would not change my spending habits with Amazon.

Bell", "ReviewID": "R27WLATCO02ZHD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I went to a local electronics to buy the Kindle Fire HDX 7\", and was \"talked into\" a Samsung 16GB Galaxy Tab 3 8\" tablet. I took it home, started set up and started downloading the apps I wanted from Google Play. Being an iPod owner, Apple had spoiled me to its user-friendly interface. I own a PC, so I didn't think it would be such a hassle, but BOY was I wrong. After an hour, I still had less than 10 apps downloaded , and the speed of the downloads was a snail's pace, along with YouTube and Netflix buffering every 10 seconds. I was sick with my purchase and took it back the next day to get what I wanted in the first place... the Kindle! I'll try to compare it to my brief experience with the Galaxy and my 4+ years with the iPod Touch 4.1.  Speed.  Kindle rivals the iPod. It's 2.2GHz quad-core processor is a speed king. The Galaxy Tab 3 only has a 1.5GHz dual core. You wouldn't think those little numbers would make such a difference, but they do.2.  Ease of Use. Another way the Kindle is similar to the iPod.  The UI for the Kindle is less cluttered and complicated than the Galaxy (and other Android devices I've seen in the stores). I realize the Kindle runs essentially on an Android platform, but Amazon made it as smooth and user-friendly as possible.(As a side note... the Samsung reps inside the store pushed the Galaxy 3 Tab with the following features that the Kindle does NOT have... rear 5MP camera, microSD expandable storage, multi/split window screen accessibility, and screen-mirroring--which would require a $70 device to control your TV with your device. All I can say is that those amazing features don't mean squat if the user experience with the interface is lousy.)3. Size and Feel. The Kindle HDX has a 7\" screen, It's about the same weight as the 8\" Galaxy I originally bought, but the difference is the FEEL.  The beveled edges and thicker casing make it ergonomically-friendly without feeling too bulky. The back has an almost \"rubberized\" feel, so it doesn't slip around in your hands. Here, it outshines the iPod/iPad and the Galaxy, whose backs are slick (metal or plastic), and both are VERY thin.  I found it difficult to hold the 8\" Galaxy in bed comfortably to read, no matter whether it was oriented for landscape or portrait.4. App Availability and Store Navigation.  Here, the iPad would win. Apple is known for its amazing apps, and Android seems to \"catch up\" at best. Not all the apps in the regular Android (now Google Play) Store are available in Kindle's App Store (which are actually Android apps), but the most popular ones are there. I have read about people \"sideloading\" missing apps into their Kindles from other third-party sites, though. If there were an app that I just couldn't live without, it would be worth a try. Kindle's App Store is very easy to navigate. It reminds me a lot of Apple's.  I will say that I like how there is a video preview of many apps in the Google App Store. But sadly, with the Galaxy, I could never get the preview to work.5. Screen Resolution. The Kindle Fire HDX and the iPad with retina display would be pretty close in comparison. The Kindle's colors are vivid, crisp, and sharp. And while some people would argue that the human eye can only process so much, I can say that my 30-something-year-old eyes which need glasses can notice a sizable difference between the Kindle and the Galaxy. The Galaxy's color was nice, but the resolution was not as good, and even my poor eyes could tell.  I can see the \"blue lines\" many people complain about in the new Kindle Fire HDX, but I only notice it on books with white pages (sepia color or night mode is fine), and it is not distracting to me at all. It's not a deal-breaker, and it only seems to show up on the edges.6. Price. The Kindle is the clear winner here. I purchased mine on sale for $199, and the 8\" Galaxy Tab3 was $269. A more comparable 7-inch, 8GB Galaxy was $139, but all the other specs were sub-par (especially the resolution and processor speed). The iPad Mini with retina display is closer in spec comparison, but totes a $399 price (the regular, non-retina iPad Mini is $299).Above all, remember this: If you go to an electronics store, beware of reps from companies inside the store. The Samsung guys were all over the tablet section of my local store like hounds pushing their products. I should have been smarter from the beginning and gone with a clear winner rather than something I knew little about. If you want a tortoise-slow, buggy tablet that will frustrate you in the first day with its failure to load apps or stream videos in a reasonable time frame, try a Samsung or similar Android device. If you want a winner with a smooth interface and a great price point, go with the Kindle. If your money grows on trees and is no object, by all means, buy the iPad Mini. For now, the Kindle is my choice, and I am so glad I returned the overpriced Samsung I tolerated for less than a day.", "Date": "January 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "So much for so little!", "Author": "Alejandro", "ReviewID": "R3OJUKKVEKI95B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a powerful tablet, just the right size to carry around with you without being too bulky.

I bought this at best buy for $200 and for the price, this tablet can't really be beat! I am absolutely in love with my new kindle fire hdx.Google Play issue:The main complaint for people is that being an android device, it doesn't have access to google play. Ridiculous right? Well, those people are kind of wrong. You can download them at 1mobile as apks and install them, but make sure that you change the settings to allow the apps(apks) to be installed from a non-amazon source. I installed so many apps from the google store available on 1mobile. You can even google them for apks and install them and they will work because this kindle is running on android. For example, i downloaded and ran dropbox without a problem. You can even sideload or root the device for the actual google play store.Speed:Apps open up quickly and the screen also rotates to landscape almost instantaneously. This baby is extremely fast due to the 2.2GHz Quad-core Snapdragon 800 CPU, with Adreno 330 GPU and 2GB of RAM. Although sometimes, the app store does lag. Amazon probably needs to improve that aspect. The Silk browser is pretty amazing. Comparable to google chrome I would say. Runs without a a hitch.Comparison of processors:HDX: 2.2 GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor, 2GB memoryNexus: 1.5GHz quad-core Snapdragon S4 Pro, 2GB memoryiPad Mini: 64-bit dual-core A7, 1GB memoryMore ram makes the device fast. The quad core is a huge plus. It's like saying 4 brains vs 2. Using 4 brains is obviously more efficient and faster. The processor is definitely nothing to scoff atAudio:Loud, rich sound with earphones. The sound is loud and clear without earphones too. No problem here.Screen:The screen on the kindle fire hdx 7' is extremely beautiful! Probably the best part about the kindle fire hdx. The HD screen provides a beautiful canvas to watch movies on netflix, play games, read manga, go on social media. When i played with the kindle in the store, the screen was just breathtaking. I haven't experienced the blue/purple edge screen thing people have been talking about though.Body:The curved tablet is actually pretty attractive to me. Many people are saying the device is not the best looking one out there, but i think it's beautiful! especially the back! It's so pretty and soft.Pros-beautiful screen-long battery life(~10 hours without watching videos)-runs smoothly than other devices-comparable to ipad in functionality-has access to apps on google play - you just need to look for apks or root it(it's easy!)-easy to hold/very lightweight- Mayday is pretty cool for those who are not tech savvy- the price is bangingCons-ugly carousel that you can't customize-somewhat confusing interface for those who aren't tech savvy-Can't add more memory if you want to - you're stuck with whatever you buy but you can use wifi to store things-no sd card slot to expand memory-the special offers - seriously amazon? We paid for a device but are subjected to ads? BUT These aren't intrusive though so it's not that bad and some of the offers are amazing-Doesn't have awkward size like Nexus 7OVERALL: BUY IT. BUY IT.

I wouldn't of asked for it, but I'm active military and deploying soon. But any-who. The Kindle Fire HDX 7\" keeps to the size of a traditional book unlike the 8.9\". Now that I have the 7 I honestly don't believe I'd like holding the 8.9 version to read.The HDX version does provide over-all flexibility as if you were almost on your laptop. All color of course. Basic web browsing functions: yahoo, gmail, etc.., video from youtube. And you can download most apps. Pinterest, twitter, Pandora... I haven't tried games yet so i'm not sure how well they work.I can tell you that with the 16GB Kindle, you can fit 2,000+ books, PLUS a other files and still have 7 to 7.5GB of free space left.  Plus multiple back light features for reading and other accessibility.I did read only one other review from a person about Battery life..... He was comparing/rating what he called heavy HD video use/streaming. if you are buying a Kindle, please keep in mind it's intended use.I wanted mine for reading and small amounts of web use... Not gaming and HD video's.Overall, The kindle HDX 7 is the perfect fit for me. I am able to store/take photo's, music, and read comfortably for as long as my eyes can take it, which to say is only a few hours. And the battery isn't below 85%-ish.

I searched to find the right box and found out the Netgear PTV3000 is the only one certified by Kindle to do it. I plugged it into my HDMI input on my Samsun plasma tv, found the connection procedures and shot the display over to my tv, after about 30 seconds or so it connects and everything works perfectly! I have a couple of little complaints about the Kindle in general. When I download movies to watch when I am not in Wifi mode, it takes a REALLY long time to download and if you try to download them in full 1080p, it takes even longer. I have settled for 720p on most movies but still takes a while. Also, when I fling movies to the tv, it does show in HD but there is fairly obvious pixelization so it is not as good as watching a Blu Ray disc. It also cuts out just a little bit every now and then but no big issues there. I got my email synced to the Kindle and that works fine. I also ordered Amazon Prime so I could watch free movies and tv shows but I would say less than half of them are actually free, which is pretty annoying. I will not pay $2 or $3 bucks to watch an older tv show when the reruns are free on tv. It would be nice if they had an option to watch them free with commercials or to pay for them. The same for older movies, we were going t Ho watch some older Christmas movies this year and several of them were not on HD Prime so you have to pay for a lot of older movies too. I am still getting to learn all the modes and I have not played any games yet so can't really reply to those. I do wish I had spent a few more bucks on the Kindle with the larger memory though, if you download a few movies, they will eat your storage space right up. Hope these comments help anyone considering this. Also, I went with the 7\" Kindle instead of the 8.9\" because I just could not justify paying almost $200 extra bucks for just 2 inches of extra screen when everything else seemed the same. I am quite happy with the 7\" screen as I use it on my train rides to and from work and I think the bigger one would be more cumbersome.

It does appear to be just slightly more yellow on the right than the left, but it's not blotchy / spotty like the HDX it's replacing. I did an experiment to verify that I'm not imagining this tint - I set the Kindle overlapping my Macbook laptop screen, and side-by-side the difference in white is quite noticeable. However, since the tint is consistent and not blotchy, it doesn't take long for my brain to \"tune out\" the yellowness and accept the white as white while reading. I'm updating my rating from 2 stars to 3 stars. I'd give it 4 stars, because I like the tablet as a whole, except that it took me three tries to obtain a Kindle HDX with a \"tolerable\" screen (I'll be keeping this latest Kindle). If you were to put all three HDXs I've used side-by-side, each screen would be noticeably different than the other when reading text on a white background. That just should not be the case.-- ORIGINAL REVIEW --I would give the Kindle Fire HDX four or five stars if not for the problems I've had with the screen. I'm on my second HDX and have just requested my third. My first HDX had something akin to \"dead pixels\" - a brown spot under the glass that looked like someone focused the sun on that spot with a magnifying glass. I returned that device immediately, only to get a replacement with a different but even more distracting screen defect that I can best describe as \"muddiness.\"I've owned a variety of laptops and tablets over the years, including the previous Kindle HD, and I've never encountered a screen that looks like you're viewing it through a thin layer of dirty water. The uneven \"dirty\" white is mostly noticeable when reading black text on a white background - which is most of the time when using the browser, news apps, or even just reading a Kindle book.When I noticed this right away on the new HDX, I remembered the story of iPhones having a similar problem due to a screen adhesive that takes time to dry, so I kept my current tablet for close to a month, using it every day with the hope that this muddiness would go away on its own. It has not. It is HIGHLY distracting, and despite the crisper resolution, I find myself wanting to return to my old Kindle HD. I've requested a third HDX to replace this, but how many of these tablets must I go through to find one with even a decent display?Just in case you think I'm fussy, I have no problem with the blue glow on the sides. The glow is in the margins and doesn't overlap text or video. If the glow was the only issue, I'd still give this tablet 4 or 5 stars. Like I said, I have lots of screens in the house to compare this to, and it's obvious that Amazon's flagship tablet should be at least on par if not better than the average everyday LCD screen.Others have had similar problems (search \"yellow HDX\") , and yet others, including professional reviewers like Ars Technica, have NOT mentioned these screen problems. This and my own experiences lead me to believe that there is a breakdown in Quality Control / Quality Assurance in the manufacturing of these devices. At the very least, it appears that the manufacturer of the screen itself is letting substandard displays out onto the market. If that's the case, then you are \"rolling the dice\" when you order the HDX.

BUT if you've never used a kindle fire HD you won't miss it at all so this isn't really a con per se.Amazon has outdone itself in my opinion. I was a big fan of the Kindle HD (which I had for 8 months) and used it constantly. I prefer Kindle greatly to my iPhone and Kindle tablets may be the reason I switch to an android phone because of how preferable I find it. The ease of use in transferring books and music is unbeatable. Drag and drop and be done with it! And though Amazon tries to push itself on you (no google market on the kindle, amazon cloud, ect) they never do anything as annoying as apple with iTunes. Kindle marries together the simplicity and straight forwardness of using an iPhone (EVERYBODY knows how to use one of those) with the customization and ease of an android. Beginners and pros alike can find something to enjoy on the Kindle HDX.And what's better is everything that people mentioned they didn't like in their reviews of the Kindle HD, Amazon fixed with this tablet. They learned their lesson and included the charger adapter, they made HD content more accessible and better quality, and upped the ante with two more processors with those who felt the Kindle couldn't keep up with their content. They even upgraded Silk to be a better browser! This is basically unprecedented with physical stores because they don't have a consistent reviewing system where the consumer literally says what they liked and don't like. It's great to know Amazon is listening.I'm very satisfied with this purchase (bought from Radioshack, not amazon so it would be here on time for Christmas) and will continue to buy Amazon's tablets whenever they come out and it's time to upgrade.

All of them love their tablets so that is the biggest ranking for this feedback.  We have used mayday and had fast and convenient service even on Christmas morning.  Overall these are excellent tablets, however, there are some drawbacks for parents:- You can not add passwords to each child's profile.  (If you have multiple children, they can easily prank each other by modifying or deleting content from another child's profile so be prepared for drama.)- The child or parent must enter the parental controls password every single time they exit from freetime. If you envision them being able to use freetime, but also to be able to exit freetime to use skype, youtube, the camera, or any other features outside of freetime app, this is a BIG PROBLEM.  The password they have to enter to exit freetime is the same parental controls password that prevents them from making purchases. Making the parental controls useless if you want your child to be able to use the tablet outside of freetime.-  There is no way to set up your children on your amazon account without them also having full access to all of your amazon account information, order history, and all of your other Amazon content.  You can get around this by setting up a separate email and amazon account just for children's kindles. but it is a hassle which still requires a credit card, or prepaid visa credit card if you anticipate using any apps.-  Very popular apps are not always available on kindle and this can cause big drama.  Two of our children got Furby Booms and expected to be able to use the Furby Boom App on their Kindle Fire HDX 7s.  The Furby Boom App is NOT available for Kindle Fire HDX.

Although I enjoy and appreciate such things as HAM radio, smart phone, laptop computer, and all Kindles starting with the original e-reader to now the Fire HDX; I am self taught so there will be no sophisticated analysis here. Two years ago I bought the first Kindle Fire and have enjoyed using it however after reading the many reviews over the past year about the Kindle Fire HDX I decided to upgrade.Primarily I use my Kindle for email, listening to the radio, reading, and having the ability to listen to music at the same time.The personal docs is another feature I enjoy as I send my favorite recipes to my Kindle and can easily share them or do my grocery shopping for the ingredients without having to make a list.  I like the lighter in weight, sharp screen with brilliant colors, longer life battery, and better sound quality.  The screen does have less glare, but not as good as the e-reader.The original Kindle fire allowed me to download music directly from Amazon but haven't figured out how to do that with the Kindle HDX, also I had the drop box on the Kindle Fire but am not able to download the app on the new Kindle HDX from the cloud.  I take pictures on my smartphone and they go directly to my laptop computer, and Kindle Fire, and of course stay on my phone; a real convenience.  I am able to go on line to dropbox.com and view my pictures that way, just not as convenient.  Despite those two negatives the Kindle Fire HDX rates five stars for quality and price.One more item, I debated whether to buy the 16 GB or 32 GB; I chose the 16 and if I could do over would choose the 32 GB. I don't download movies but I do like a choice of books and music that will take the bulk of my storage ability.

I purchased this as a birthday gift for my 7 year old, who was obsessed with my iPad. I was going to purchase an iPad mini, but I thought the freetime feature would be perfect to avoid arguments about time  allowed and the price is hard to beat. First thing I noticed when I opened the device and held it is that it is very lightweight...this does make it easier to hold, but it also makes it feel a little flimsy, which was worrisome considering it is going to a child (albeit a very conscientious child who takes good care of her things). Set-up was a little obnoxious, but nothing terribly difficult, it took about 15 minutes all told. The screen resolution is indeed fantastic as all the rave reviews state. Also, the subscription service for childrens content is amazing, I highly recommend it for the variety of content (books, games, videos, etc.) available for a steal (less than $3 a month). While the Freetime feature is great to set time limits, allows access to great subscription content, and is very easy for children to navigate, it does have a few flaws. It consolidates all Apps into one group, so while you may want to limit time spent on games, you may want to allow your child access to things like an alarm clock feature or Skype. There is no means to differentiate between apps, and once their time is used, they will not be able to access anything which falls under that type of content. And to be honest, I still have to deal with my child's attempts to negotiate more time as she knows that the Freetime feature is customizable, so while it may be helpful for younger kids, don't expect it to eliminate an older child's attempts to garner more screen time. Second, the camera feature is really only for video-chatting purposes as it only faces the individual, so taking photos is pretty much out of the question. Finally, our first device froze irrecoverably after three days of use...major bummer. Amazon was amazing and promptly shipped us out a new device free of charge, and while this could have been a total fluke, it happened, and I have serious doubts about long term longevity of the device. BUY A WARRANTY if you need this to last more than a year or two. So having had the device for about two months now, I feel confident in saying that IF price is your determining factor and you are looking for a gift for a younger child, go for the kindle. If not, the iPad mini is probably a better bet for overall build, functionality, and versatility for an older child.", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "HDX = Epic Win", "Author": "Dairenn Lombard", "ReviewID": "R1NDUAFBCNASNA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, owning a tablet for me seemed like a little bit of an oxymoron.  I am a power user--so I need a full-sized keyboard, a mouse (or trackball since space is at a premium for me usually), a huge screen and lots of storage, memory and processing power.  A laptop with that much capability costs nearly twice as much as a desktop, so that's what I use.  But more and more, I've been wanting to watch videos, browse photos or maybe quickly check e-mail and social media when I can't be near a computer because of privacy concerns or workplace rules.  So, I bought a laptop, but no matter how light, thin or small they get (with the old, short-lived netbooks coming quite close to what I needed), it was never convenient to whip them out on the bus or train, or while waiting for them.  Not to mention prudent in certain parts of town, unlike a tablet, where it might look like you're just reading a book in the right case.Before the Kindle Fire, your choice was an iPad or so-called \"affordable\" tablets that left you jealous of iPad users.  For me, the value proposition was poor--nearly $700 with no expandable storage, replaceable battery, the ability to use the on-board storage via USB for transferring or backing up data without the use of iTunes, and other edge-case use case scenarios that doesn't apply to the average Apple user, but did to me.  Then, with the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" tablet, I at least got USB access to the onboard storage, and the ability to load apps that let me watch my video files and browse photos in slideshow mode, and at 50% of the cost.Plus, while other Android tablets like the Galaxy by Samsung and the Nexus by Google are becoming increasingly valuable offerings, I am actually a fan of the Amazon content ecosystem.  Google Play, to me, just doesn't seem to be \"there\" yet.  And I already benefit from iTunes on my iPod and desktop computer.  The Kindle gives me my favorite way to enjoy movies and, in particular, my favorite TV shows.  And Amazon's selection is vast (rivaling iTunes and beating out NetFlix and especially Hulu), especially for TV shows and music, having the biggest music library thanks to AutoRip on catalog items not even available at iTunes.  Even their movie rental system works better--being cheaper, less prone to experiencing spontaneous failures or other errors and integrating wonderfully with their entire system.  For example, movie recommendations can be based on past DVD (or even VHS) purchases, if you've been buying things from them for that long.It's easy to view rented movies on a full-sized HD TV (it was even easier with the mini HDMI output on the previous model), but today's LED HD sets are largely able to Wi-Fi their way onto the Internet, so this missing feature will largely go unnoticed, even for a tech head like me.  I understood going in that the purpose of the Amazon Kindle family of wireless electronic devices is to serve as an easy, convenient, user-friendly access point of their content whether it's e-books, newspapers and magazines or music, movies, TV shows and games.  The edge here is that you can have this remarkable value proposition at a far less expensive price point--even on the 8.9\" tablet.Of course, what I didn't like when I got the original HD 8.9\" was the nasty performance, particularly apparent during use of Silk, the Kindle Fire web browser.  The CPU was so obviously lacking in power for handling the majority of web pages I was visiting to look at pictures.  At first, I thought it was the sluggishness of 54mbps Wi-Fi compared to the 1 GBit/Sec. wired Ethernet connections available to my desktop and work laptop computer, but with this upgrade, I discovered that is not true.  The #1 benefit to upgrading from the HD to the HDX model was, by far, the fact that it is snappy.  Everything took forever on the old Kindle Fire HD.  On this device, I am flipping between apps, bringing up pages as fast as allowed by the bandwidth that I and the web server have, transferring files over USB at true 2.0 speeds without slowing down to calculate how many files have to be copied first.  Most important of all, apps do not crash all the time on the HDX like they began to on the old Fire HDs.  Pages routinely crashed Silk, even more so after the upgraded client, which supported a bunch of new features that I liked, but had maddening stability issues.And it wasn't just the browser.  The built in Amazon video app for playing movies streaming or downloaded from Amazon natively were forcing a hard reset of the device from time to time.  Sometimes, several times in a row.  My tablet was beginning to fall into disuse because I was beginning to expect any video playback was going to cause crashes.  Couple that with running out of space for loading new videos, and it was looking bad.Not so with the Kindle Fire HDX.  FireOS 3.0 is stable!  I opted for max storage at 64 GB, but, to keep it affordable, went with the smaller 7\" device, which ended up being significantly lighter and therefore easier to handle with one hand instead of two, and super fast to take out and put away in my bag.  Even though it's 2.9\" less diagonal viewing area, I barely notice the difference when browsing photos or watching video.  Especially since the color accuracy and sharpness of the 1080 (up from 720) HD-resolution video was instantly noticeable, even though it was over two weeks since I'd seen the display of the old HD 8.9\" that I had traded in.  I see the blue LED on pure white screens around the edges, but it doesn't bother me.  It actually looks pleasant to me.Between the stunning video display quality, super fast performance, stability, and expanded storage, I can now barley keep my hands off this thing.  I want to use it every chance I can get.

The performance is far superior in terms of speed, and in spite of the limitations others mention about downloading movies, I am okay with the limitations, use it to watch movies on plane trips or when there is no wifi. The unit is lighter, thinner and overall it has a feel of being well built, though so did the others. Reading it in bed is a bit easier, and it clearly picks up internet wifi better.The HDX is light years ahead of the first version, I have all three.  The first version works fine, easy to read, but the HD and now the HDX are major upgrades from the first one. I love the fact many books can be read out loud with a good voice and accuracy, which I use while eating.It is hard to imagine what the next upgrade will offer, and what their encore will be to motivate me to upgrade again.

I am very pleased.  The purple shadow in the books that lots of people talk about it not really that noticeable.  I probably would not have noticed it had I not read about it.  Not a problem for me.  Worst thing is when I re-downloaded all my apps I lost all my scores that were on my old kinde. Like Scrabble is at zero.  Angry Birds is like I never played ever. Amazon said they can't do anything about that.  I also paid for the Eagle in Angry Birds Rio and that is also not transferrable.  Again, not a big deal.  I set it to charge at 1:30 at 60% and it is at 100% 2 hours later.  I miss the colored on/off button showing the charging (green and orange).  You have to turn the unit on to see how much charging is there.  When I used the camera zooming disturbs the pixels so I am not excited about that but I am not a big picture taker with cell phones or tablets anyway.  Plus the 7\" only has a front camera anyway.One thing that is a gripe is that each time they come out with a new kindle you have to purchase a new cover because they (I think on purpose) reposition things so they do not line up with your present cover.  Keeps the people that make covers in business I suppose.  At least the charger for the old Kindle fits the new Kindle so I have an extra to keep in my suitcase.All in all, I am very pleased.  If the reading charge is close to the 17 hours they advertise (probably closer to 14 if I know Amazon) then I will be happy.  We travel a lot and I wanted more charging for that.  Plus being able to read easier outside was a big deal for me.  I think it is well worth the money.  I love it.I am adding an edit to my original review.  The blue haze, I set my books on the tan (was called sepia in the old kindle) and I adjusted the brightness to about 50% and I don't notice it at all now.

I've had it for a tad over 4 months now, and it's awesome.  I love bragging about the Specs, since they are inarguably the best specs available on a tablet of this size, and this price range.  It feels great to know you have the best.  Sometimes, I wish I had the Play Store, but most popular apps are available on Amazon's app store, so most of the time, I don't really miss it.  It's extremely easy to sideload apps that aren't available on the app store anyway. I love the Free App per Day program on the app store, where they offer a different (normally paid) app for free, every single day.  Sometimes it's stuff you won't really use, but every once in a while there are jewels that you can't pass up.  I've only used MayDay a couple of times, but those times I've used it, it's been awesome, and Amazon Customer service never seizes to disappoint me.  The only issue that I've had (and the one that I mistakenly requested a replacement unit for), is that when the battery gets under 30%, the screen tends to flicker just slightly, almost like a CRT screen.  After describing this to a mayday agent (before I realized it only happened on low battery), they kindly sent me through to customer service to get a replacement unit.  After I got the replacement, and it did the same, I figured it was just a normal thing, and didn't bother them again.

I'm writing this on my wife's account, and it's really her Fire, but I'm hearing the input she has and it's nothing but praise.Truthfully, if we didn't have some specific things we do with the tablet, we might have gone with another brand; probably a Nexus 7. It turns out, though, that our needs are very specific and they have a lot to do with doing business with Amazon. Here's our list of deal breaker priorities:1. She wants to simply browse the internet while she's sitting and watching TV. Does the Fire come with the best browser? Probably not, but it comes with a very credible one. I looked into it and found that I could install Chrome if she wanted, but she's very happy with Amazon's silk. No need to change browsers.2.She checks her email using her Fire when we're on the road. I usually hog the laptop so she uses the Fire to check email. I bought the fire having no idea that the newer versions have Bluetooth. I checked the Bluetooth against an old Bluetooth mouse and it seems to work great. Now we're considering buying a Bluetooth keyboard for her to use on the road just to use for returning more detailed emails and maybe some minor editing of some of our writing too. This wasn't on the \"deal breaker\" list, or even on the list at all, but it turns out to be a nice bonus.3. Finally, and this is the primary deal breaker because the above two items could be accomplished by any number of tablets. We have a reasonable investment in digital media purchased from Amazon. We really like the way Amazon has things set up with their Unbox program for PCs and so on. Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't provide a player for their movies and TV shows on iPad or even other other Android tablets. So for viewing movies and TV shows from Amazon, especially off line like we like to do when we're away from the internet, it's either a Microsoft Surface (using Windows 8 and the Amazon Unbox player) or a Fire. The Surface looks promising, but it's kind of expensive when we have such a small and specific list of needs.I've found that Amazon seems to consistently  sell their media for a bit cheaper than most other sources. I like (trust) their cloud storage, and already have a sizable investment in their products. Given all these factors, it was looking like the new 7\" Fire HDX was a good choice.We have an old 1st generation Fire that she was using for all the above. The Silk browser was pretty quirky and pretty slow but sort of worked. In our home in Angel fire, New Mexico, where we have only satellite internet and really slow latency (long ping times), the Fire was almost unusable.The new Fire is like night and day. It's leaps and bounds better than the old one, and the old one was a good buy when we got it. My wife is pleased as punch with the new Fire for our needs, which admittedly are very specific. We believe there's no reason to spend more money for stuff we don't need and we should buy our products tailored to fit our specific needs. Given that we each have Kindle Paperwhite readers, hundreds of books plus lots of TV shows and movies, and that we've never had a bad experience with Amazon, we're comfortable adding another Fire to our inventory of readers. It's just a great fit for us.As for the old Fire, it's now mine. I don't use it for browsing or email, or even for watching movies although it worked pretty good for that. What I do is send documents over to read offline, usually technical reading I get on the internet related to Photoshop, Wordpress, and a few other topics. I then send those pages and documents over to the Fire to read off line. The Fire - even the old one - is a great tablet for reading documents that are read indoors and have color illustrations, like Photoshop tutorials and so on.So for us, it couldn't have been a better choiceDonald Finkhiddenmesa.com", "Date": "December 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "WiFi Connectivity", "Author": "John Oldenkamp", "ReviewID": "R2D4NDXAQYOGTC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To be honest, I do not own this particular unit.

Surfing the web is also fast as well when your shopping online and I do like it that it is so light that I can hold it in one hand so your hand won't get tired quickly.The pro:- super fast (on WiFi) (must be even faster on 4G)- graphic is excellent (good for movie and games)- very light which you can hold longer without tired your handThe con:- only has front camera- no memory slot (if you need more memory, buy the 32GB or 64GB which is like $40 or $80 more) (which I think it pricy compare to buying a memory card)- there is not a lot of good apps compare to iTunes and google play.

To me, the ad is not in my way at all.  It only there when the screen is lock due to inactivity, but after you unlock the screen, it will not be there any more.

It looks beautiful and has a lot of features I enjoy. The quick menu at the bottom of the screen is great for keeping frequently used apps handy yet keeps the carousel uncluttered. I don't remember being able to set a passcode on the HD, which I've done on the HDX. The Mayday button is worth the Kindle's weight in gold. I was having difficulties getting apps I purchased on my desktop to download to the device. Talking to the techs I was able to deregister the device and reregister and all the apps appeared like magic.The loss of one star is for several reasons. I have noticed buggy issues with connectivity, downloading apps (device or desktop purchases), and connections with the tech during a Mayday call. I made 7 calls to get the app issue mentioned above resolved. it wasn't that the techs didn't know what to do (one had just fixed the problem for someone else so knew exactly what to do), it was that after 2-3 minutes the call would automatically disconnect. I did get very good at summing up the problem in as few words as possible but it was very frustrating to have to do it 7 times. At the end of all the calls it asked if the problem was resolved and I kept clicking no. I later learned that's probably held against the tech and felt horrible because they all were so friendly and helpful for the time I talked to them.Another feature I don't care for is the limited number of recommended items. When you have the focus on an item in the carousel, just below it displays suggested items you may also enjoy. On the HD, the list was 8-10 items and on the HDX it's only 4 with an option to See All. A bit clumsier than the old method.Overall, I would purchase this again and again and, if I could afford it, would buy one for everyone I know to ween them from whatever they're using now. Fix the buggy Mayday calls and the weird downloads and it'll bump back up to 5 stars.UPDATE 1/6/14 - I have changed it from 4 to 5 stars, as promised.

The color distribution of the screen is completely off. One side of the  has a much deeper yellow color and the other side is very cold. This is probably a light bleed issue too I suspect.

My considerations for a tablet were: size that isn't too small or too big, comfortable to hold in one hand since I'd primarily use it for reading, Retina (or better) like display, good audio and less than 250 bucks. The HDX fit the bill. I pre-ordered it and got it delivered the day of release. Even then I waited a few days to put up my review. As I mentioned earlier, the stuff advertised about the HDX are all true - including the amazing display, sound etc - so I won't repeat them. I love the device. However, it loses a star because of the distracting bluish/purple haze on the borders when am reading something - be it a web page / Kindle book. Apart from that, the device suddenly rebooted a couple of times without rhyme or reason. The 'Mayday' button is one heck of a technological feat and I am pretty sure we'll see similar 'engaging' support for other devices and products in the market.

Loved that it came with a wall charger.The Good:  Sleek look, movies and videos look great playing, Affordable, Kids Freetime is the biggest perk for me.  My son loves to use my phone (iPhone) to watch PBS kids but I'm always getting him out of the AppStore.  So having him able to only access what I give to him is great!!  Touch screen is easy to manipulate and calibrated nicely.  So easy to set up, connect all my accounts, downloading all my books from the cloud and set up only took maybe 5 minutes if that.  Sound is crisp, pretty loud for a small tablet.The Bad: Since only owning Apple products, some of my favorite apps aren't available.  I.E. Had to download a basic app for a calculator.  Screen does have a glare (somewhat expected), does smudge (just like my phone does, also expected).  Wifi issues.  Ill preface by saying I'm honestly not sure exactly where the problem is coming from, I have yet to try mayday to get suggestions.  Things aren't loading properly and I'm having to shut off wifi, restart the kindle, turn the wifi back on for it to work.  I've done this 3x today.  I made sure my phone and other wifi devices were working to double check bandwidth issues.  Seems to be working okay.  This will be a deal breaker for me so hopefully mayday can help me.  Lack of customizing you can do does bug me, Id love to see my sons big smiling face on the wallpaper, that is not possible.  Lack of additional memory options, though I knew about that.Overall I think it's a great product for the money.  It does everything I would like it to do.  Most of the negatives I can live without or deal with.  I'll be contacting amazon soon about the Wifi issue and will update this review.*UPDATE* 10/29/2013Wifi issue was a home issue.  We had to change a router to get better wifi distribution with more channels.  Thankfully this is fixed.  Couple other things I've noticed:  The battery take forever to charge.  Not a deal breaker, I charge it overnight but its a little annoying.  Kids Freetime, as I mentioned before my BIGGEST drawer to the HDX...BUT downloading the same apps as my iphone has (free kid apps), in-app purchasing is still there so when his little finger accidentally clicks an ad or \"buy\" buttons, the kindle buy box still pops up, now with 1-click buying I have noticed he has bought a couple things.  This makes the situation worse than it is with the apple appstore because there I have a password.  I for the life of me can't figure out how to turn off 1-click purchasing so that a password box will at least pop up.", "Date": "October 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome!", "Author": "Christine L.

We set up Kindle FreeTime and it has been a huge hit with our 3 year old.  We started a free trial of Kindle FreeTime Unlimited that gives her access to thousands of books, games, videos and songs.  Some of these are junk, but many are items we have purchased for other devices in the past or were considering purchasing for the Kindle Fire.  There are Boynton books, Ivy & Bean, episodes of Sesame Street, Dora and Mr. Rogers, as well as Cut the Rope, Monopoly, Life, Bejeweled 2 and other great games.  You can find a list of what is available on Amazon.com (currently over 1500 items).  While the videos are not a big draw if you subscribe to Prime, like we do, Prime members get a discount on the monthly subscription fee, currently $4.99 / child or $9.99 / family.  Prime members only pay $2.99 / child or $6.99 / family.  At $2.99 per month, I feel that Kindle FreeTime Unlimited is, by far, the best feature of the Kindle Fire HDX for us.  If you are a Prime member with children under 10 years old, I would give my strongest recommendation to the Kindle Fire HDX.The Kindle Fire HDX is a great tablet that balances form, function and price.  There are some key differences that set this tablet apart from the iPad Mini 2 and the Nexus 7.  The Nexus 7 has a slower processor.  The iPad Mini 2 has a 7.9\" screen with higher resolution but a much higher price.  The Kindle Fire HDX has no rear camera and the screen has a bluish tint on the edges from the blue LED lighting, but neither bother me.  The Kindle Fire HDX has the least apps available of the three, but all the android apps I like are available.  On the plus side, the Kindle FIre HDX is very user friendly thanks to it's clear and smooth interface and mayday help feature.  If you are an Amazon Prime member or purchase music, ebooks and videos from Amazon then the Kindle Fire HDX is a very seamless way to enjoy your content.My setup consisted of pressing the power button, selecting my language and wifi access point, entering my wifi password and confirming my Amazon account.  It took about 50 seconds.  I was immediately impressed by the screen's resolution, vibrant, accurate colors and wide viewing angles.  The screen automatically adjusts for ambient light, not just with changing brightness but also changing contrast.  Speakers sound good for a tablet, but i wish they weren't rear-facing like every other tablet.  The tablet is incredibly responsive; everything is instantaneous.  Wifi is fast and gets good reception throughout my house without dropping the connection.  The tablet isn't too heavy and feels comfortable thanks to the contoured back with good grip.  I'm not really the kind of person to use the mayday feature, but I see it as being one of the biggest selling points.

Feels really solid and well built. Appstore relative scarcity is not an issue since you can easily sideload APKs if you have them. But...1. When first reading about the purple border \"feature\", I figured it was overblown or exaggerated and wouldn't be an issue. I mean, I have a gen 1 Paperwhite and the faint light blotches seem negligible to me. However, the bluish borders on my HDX are neither subtle nor negligible in size and you can bet I'd be unhappy about them even had I not heard about them first. It is really distracting on anything with a white background. I read at least 10 industry reviews prior to purchase and I didn't see this mentioned once (apparently it was an aside in one review I missed). I have to think this means there is some variance between units and I got a bad one, while the reviewers saw the best examples.2. There's also some non-trivial screen flicker, particularly when I'm in the Settings pages. It's as if it's trying to auto-adjust the brightness, but I have mine set to manual.3. This is minor one, but how can a device whose stated purpose is multimedia consumption not have a graphic equalizer built into the OS?I'll probably wait a bit to see how this all shakes out, but I'm sure I'll be exchanging/returning mine. I'd be completely happy if the screen issues were resolved.***************************************Edit 10/25: Just had an interesting chat with the very courteous Mayday rep \"Cody\". I asked him if the blue haze is supposed to be the same width along all edges of the screen of all Kindle HDX's, and he said yes. I then told him the haze was wider along the long edges of my screen, and he said he's heard that as well (oops). I then asked him if the haze is supposed to be the same width and brightness along each of those long edges (where it's most visible), and he said yes. When I told him that the haze is much wider/brighter along one long edge than the other - the bottom edge opposite the camera, he didn't have a whole lot to say (oops #2), other than this is not considered a defect that warrants a replacement. I then asked him if every HDX exhibits this to the the same degree, and he said, \"they're supposed to\". When I asked him if they actually are all the same, all he would say was to repeat that they're supposed to be.It might sound like I was being a jerk, but it really was just a calm discussion where I wanted those specific questions answered, and there was definitely some waffling on their part. And they are going to replace mine, due to the screen flicker. But if you call with just the haze issue, be prepared to return rather than replace.

There's an experimental player in this Kindle, and they are improving on it.  However, with the vast amount of content Amazon has available to us on Kindle(especially if you're a Prime Member, which I recommend) there is plenty of things to view.Speaking of viewing, the crisp, clear (no motion blur) image is among the best out there.MayDay has the greatest  access to TechSupport I've ever used and it's FREE, 24/7/365 .Top of the screen is divided up with all your function tabs, and additional are provided with a 'pull-down' finger swipe (MayDay is there).WiFi works very well and the front facing camera is for video chat (no rear camera on the HDX-7in) which I don't need anyway.Recharges quickly and the battery life is good (which always depends on what your doing with any device).Downloads and Installs are quick (never had a problem) and you can get right to the new app.I'll overcome this objection; the one about not being able to get the REAL youTube; yes you can without any side-loading.Kindle provides Google for search; if you have any Google account like GMail, pull up Google, sign-in to GMail and at the top right.

You can actually feel the the buttons for the volume and to turn it off which is fantastic compared to the HD. I actually painted dots on the HD to be able to tell where the buttons were and what they were for. With the HDX you feel 2 buttons on one side and one on the other side to turn it off. The Graphic's are better on the HDX but unless you have the HDX and the HD side by side you may not notice. HDX is thinner and lighter then the HD and that is noticeable.

When the HDX model came out late last year, I was interested in some of the features particularly the stated improved screen, not that there were complaints about its predecessor's readability! When amazon offered the HDX on an  incentive payment plan, I couldn't resist so clicked the purchase. It arrived a day earlier than advertised, an auspicious beginning, and was packed in recyclable cardboard which pleased this Tree Hugger greatly. The minimalist box for the device was likewise showing consideration for the environment which still affording a design tour d' force. a simple decorative sleeve houses the box in which the Kindle nestles along with the power cord and adapter, plus a small, plain set up sheet for the beginner.This edition of the Kindle Fire is noticeably thinner. I did have some difficulty plugging the cord into it as it goes in at an angle, whereas the other model was a straight shot. Finding the power button, changed from the bottom next to the charging cord to the back of the device, was likewise confounding briefly but other than that, I'd have to say... it was all a piece of cake, and of course the amazon cloud had already registered this newest Kindle along with preparing to download all the eBooks etc. Couldn't be much easier than that.In the case of the Kindle Fire HDX, I'd have to say, it is truly a refined device in all regards and justifies the purchase. I strongly recommend getting one of the Kindle eBooks on the Fire HDX to speed up the use of your new device. I found it enormously beneficial in both cases, throughout time. I am currently using the Kindle Fire HDX & HD Complete Guidebook published March, 2014.As a further satisfied purchaser of the device, may I state that while I am a bonafide Apple User, I still prefer the Kindle Fire (HDX) for eBooks and definitely for the value that amazon provides in pricing them.", "Date": "April 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Faster, brighter, lighter, better!", "Author": "Brad Shea", "ReviewID": "RF92BO14OA20C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have FIVE Kindle Fires in this house.

I love that I can change the background color of what I'm reading (to black), allowing me to read at night in bed without disturbing my girlfriend with how bright the screen would be otherwise. I can easily change the size of the font when I'm getting tired. I also love how I can check my progress of the current chapter, as well as the entire book. The easily accessible menu options doesn't distract me from my spot while reading. The dictionary and X-Ray while reading is smooth and easy to navigate.I wanted to be able to write on my tablet. I found it was Bluetooth compatible with most keyboards out there. And you can snag a great one at a great price. Then came the writing programs itself.

I like that I can prop the Kindle wherever I need to (using the origami case) and have the keyboard on my lap or wherever is most comfortable.There are many apps not compatible with the HDX, yet are said to have worked with earlier versions.

The ability to download & store on the Kindle was new for HDX for Prime users, and you can't do that on the HD.But, after opening the HDX to use, we discovered it does NOT have an HDMI port to connect to the TV with an HDMI cable, like the previous Kindle Fire HD. I cannot believe Amazon removed the HDMI port for the HDX! Makes no sense, and apparently other customers were caught off-guard, too. If you read the description very closely, you'll find that info, but I don't think any HD user expected them to REMOVE a great feature like that.The only way to display HDX content on your TV is to have a TV already set up for Miracast or buy a wireless Miracast adapter (like the crappy Netgear one). In spite of being able to download movies with the HDX rather than live-stream, we still have to use this added wireless device anyway, and had to pay a good bit for it, on top of the HDX price. So, we still get some buffering glitches with this, and the quality is not very good (pixilation), even when we download the movie at the highest quality available. I can't be sure if the problems are from the HDX or the Netgear Miracast adapter, but the end result is we're not using the capability for which I bought the darn thing.Overall, the Kindle Fire HDX and the added Miracast wireless device are a disappointment. Definitely prefer our old Kindle Fire HD with the HDMI cable, even though we have to stream live with it. We're still doing that to watch movies instead of using the download-to-HDX option. IF the HDX with the Miracast adapter worked well (no glitches/hiccups, no pixilation), it would probably be worth it in spite of the additional costs because you wouldn't have to be tethered to the TV with the HDMI cable. That was never really a problem, but it's the only advantage I can see with the HDX. But you do still have to have that added device connected to your TV, with its cables & power supply.I almost returned the HDX when discovered the HDMI problem, but decided to get the Miracast device and try it out. In spite of the disappointment & the fact that we cannot use this at all as intended, we kept the HDX just to have an additional tablet to toss in a backpack or purse. I got it on sale right before Xmas, and it's sort of handy to have 2 (can use one while other is charging), but overall, there's no real benefit over the HD for us, and the HD was a better deal.By the way, I contacted Amazon about the HDX and Miracast devices before I bought an adapter, was transferred to their \"Kindle Fire HDX experts in technical service\" (apparently in India) and got no where. They couldn't tell me anything about which Miracast adapters are available, which ones work, etc. They basically read from the Web description that the HDX uses Miracast. That's it.

I called customer care, they helped me quickly reset the device to factory settings and it seemed to have fixed it.  I am concerned I have a defect though.

I've been using a regular classic Kindle for book-reading for several years and I find the HDX 7 to be almost exactly the same size, slightly heavier, but just as convenient to use and transport - and with a wealth of great features! I purchased the upgraded version with 64GB memory, wireless only, and paid the $15 for \"without special offers\".  Great deal!  Colors are superb and the unit works fine with my AOL email & Facebook accounts.  Reading on-line news and FB text is a little challenging because of the small print but \"pinch & spread\" takes care of that pretty well although the larger 8.9\" Fire HDX would certainly be a bit better in that regard.  Book reading is fine, no problems, and the faint blue \"corona\" along the edges of the page is pretty inconsequential as far as I can see.Battery life is very good (especially when doing mostly book-reading) but if one is using a lot of battery-eating graphics a daily recharge will be a way of life.  Needless to say, my old Kindle shines in this respect because the battery typically only has to recharge once a month, but then the Fire HDX does *SO MUCH* more!Audio for music is adequate volume (although not ear-blastingly loud) through the speakers and great in headphones, and I find the audio quality excellent.  Controls are easy to learn and seem pretty intuitive to me.My only minor complaint is that the on-board camera faces the user, not the rear of the device - which is fine for Skype or taking photos of oneself if you're into that sort of thing - but then, who the heck uses a tablet for taking pictures, anyway?  I watched a fellow tourist doing that with his iPad when we were in Iceland and I thought - and still think - that it's a dumb way to take photos (I'll stick with my easier-to-carry and fractionally expensive digicam, thank you very much).FWIW, I'm 72 and strongly believe that any \"senior citizen\" who isn't embracing today's technology is missing out on a *LOT* that can keep life fun and the brain active. I've been using a compact netbook for several years while traveling but a tablet like the Fire HDX is a great and not bank account-breaking way to enjoy reading good books, catching up on email and news, following sports scores, using social networking, etc., etc., and all in a much more compact package.So, don't be an old fud, get with modernity!!!  ;-)", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "The best 7\" Tablet on the market!", "Author": "Mike R", "ReviewID": "R37ZK1X4Y66SO6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Absolutely the best tablet out there.

The rubbery frame is easy to hold, and doesn't feel cheap. The viewing area (reportedly Gorilla glass) is generous and fairly smudge free.Integration with Google apps like gmail, calendar, etc is very easy. My inbox, contacts, and entire calendar were up and running in just a few minutes.Tunes sound good, whether it be from my own collection in the Amazon cloud, via Pandora, or on YouTube. Placing the Kindle face up on a hard surface optimizes tone and volume.Most website functionality is comparable to a PC, but there are the occasional pages that look funny. As an example, I use my Kindle as an auxiliary while playing Battlefield 4, and while it's usually easy to manipulate, there are times when screen resolution makes buttons/web parts awkward.As far as books, I only have a few so far. Some seem better adapted to the Kindle format than others; The Oatmeal's \"How to Tell if Your Cat is Plotting to Kill You\" is flawless, but Sun Tzu's \"Art of War\" has the occasional odd hard-return.Although the auto-brightness feature is a nice touch, but I've found that it sometimes it will \"adjust\" for no reason. Still not enough to drop it down from 5 stars.I can't comment on Facebook or Twitter functionality as I use neither of those, but the StumbleUpon app is fun.If my Kindle HDX gets broken, for whatever reason, I would buy another without hesitation.

I'm a guy and what I like I figure she would like - right?  So I bought it.  So as to be sure she realized the kindle is now something real and useful in so many other ways, I first prepared the Kindle introduction video. Kimble has a great video explaining all the benefits that it does.I prepared the TV which we have hooked up to a computer to first show her the video before opening the box to see what it is.  I figured once she saw all the cool stuff it does she would defiantly have a change of heart by loving it and wanting it.She saw the video, opened it up and began learning it all.  Kindle has a REALLY good feature.  Tap one button and a live person comes on screen to guide you through anything at all.  They can even do it for you by drawing circles around what they click and do so you can see and learn - really making it easy.My wife learned enough very fast as to contact this live tech person on Christmas day.And, she asked him for help.

I capture streamed spoken-word radio which I want to then listen to on all my devices (iPhone, Kindle Fire HDX, Roku-outfitted TV).  Google's uploader can be set up to automatically scan my music folders and refresh my library with any new content, and Amazon's uploader does not do that.While Google does offer a web version of their music player - which works fine in the Silk browser - it doesn't have as many features as their native app.Other than that, I've been quite happy so far.

Also before getting the Kindle I read comments about the \"annoying blue light\" that surrounds the edges while reading books, and I was a little hesitant about getting a reading device that is annoying to read books on, but when I received the Kindle and was reading on it, I didn't notice the light until midway through a book when I remembered people complaining about it.", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great tablet and e-reader", "Author": "SDBolts619", "ReviewID": "R5L5HQP9R03C9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received the 16gb version with special offers for Christmas and am just now sending it back in so I can upgrade to the 64gb version.

The Kindle is an INCREDIBLE tool for readers - and for those who may be averse to picking up a paperback. I honestly never thought of myself as an avid novel reader, but this gadget has totally changed that and I look forward to the breaks where I get to read. My only problem now is finding more great books to read! (For the record I have read, and thoroughly enjoyed these books on my kindle: Night Film (Marisha Pessl), World War Z (Max Brooks), Zone One (Colson Whitehead). I also read an advance copy of my sister's book, which I had read before but enjoyed even more on second reading on the kindle (another excellent tool -- your kindle can convert a PDF into a Kindle doc! So Cool! All you need to do is email the PDF to your kindle email with the word \"CONVERT\" in the subject, and voila! It shows up in your \"Docs\" as a Kindle-version of the PDF which is much easier read and navigated than a PDF). So, in short WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? BUY THIS THING NOW!***I was a little hesitant buying this having been a tried and true Apple fan. First though, I should explain that you REALLY want to buy this without the special offers. It's a little more money, but if you DON'T pay the extra, you see ads on the home screen every time you open up the device. So yeah, pay the extra to get rid of thes ads.As for the device itself, it is FAST. Like, the fastest operating system of anything in our house including my MacBook Pro, iPad or any of our iPhones. I LOVE reading on it too. The screen doesn't make your eyes ache like the iPad, and the text is really easy and clear to read. It is also super duper light weight.The only downside I've seen so far is there is no integration with Chromecast, which would be awesome.Overall though, really impressed with this little device, and would highly recommend it to anyone considering buying it.

Firstly I will address the many issues people tend to have with this device and comment on my personal situation.Wifi - Setting up Wifi at first was a little shotty as my router had to be reset a couple of times to allow it to access the kindle. At random times it seems like it drops wifi but this happens infrequently and isnt all that annoying unless it is during a video.Blue Tint - This is noticeable on my device on white screens but perhaps I wouldnt have even seen it hadnt I read so many reviews on it. It really doesnt bother me all that much and I turn the kindle to dark view when reading anyways. Unless yours is really bad I think this is just people nitpicking.Battery - So far it has been pretty strong. I watched a lot of media on this device and I have seen it last anywhere from 7-12 hours. I have noticed it depends on strength of wifi and screen brightness mostly. I watched 4 episodes of Justified last night and it only dropped about 25-30%.App Store - This is one of those things that people can research pretty indepthly before purchasing the device, so why people complain about it is beyond me. They are missing some key apps outside of google play store but many of them can be sideloaded using 1mobilemarket or an equivalent. I have noticed the apps through amazon are generally a version or two behind but its not a deal breaker.I understand you cant do this on an ipad either, but I wish you could rename apps. I hate when I download an app from Amazon and it has a weird name and throws it off alphabetically when I am looking for it.Now for the positives:Screen - The picture on this device is immaculate. Watching media is very crisp and enjoyable even on the 7\" device. The colors are accruate.Speakers - The speakers are very good on this device, much better than expected. It is perfect for watching on your lap, table or bed. They dont get too loud but I have never, as of yet, needed to watch something with them a full capactiy.Media - One of the key selling points is the ability to download videos to the device for offline viewing. I have noticed that the xfinity app allows you to do the same thing that Amazon has promised w this device. There are not many great movies to download and people are upset w this through Amazon Prime Video, however the list of tv shows is exceptional. They have a lot where you can either view/download the videos to the device. Amazon prime is strongly suggested if you were to purchase this device.Reading - Reading is a delight on this device. Very crisp and sharp and I love that you can download overdrive and rent books via your library. The Amazon Kindle Lending library is very weak and if you are considering this as a reason to buy then forget it all together.Overall I am very impressed with this device and at $229 ($179 on cyber monday) it is definitley worth a buy. It is more of a media consumption device then a tablet so to speak. I notice that when I am using it I seem to run out of things to do on it, unlike an iphone/ipad but still I think it is a great device for the budget conscious buyer.", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Bought as a gift for my wife - she won't put it down", "Author": "J.

She wants things that \"just work\" so after debating between a Nexus 7 versus this, I ended up going with the Kindle.The special offers are unobtrusive and easily ignored. The screen is amazing - better than the iPad by far and pretty comparable to the Nexus 7 I use. She uses it for reading, Facebook, Pinterest, and a few other apps. Though I would prefer that Amazon just use the Google Play store she gets along well enough with Amazon's app store, despite the fact that common apps such as Google Chrome are missing.The Kindle also has some annoying limitations on customization. My wife wanted to change the background to a picture but apparently that feature is not implemented for some odd reason. She also wanted to rename it from Kindle #2 but apparently that is not allowed either. I think the tradeoff in being easy to use might have overstepped a bit here, as asking to put your own pictures on as a background shouldn't really be an issue, nor should renaming it to be more personally named be such an issue either. Perhaps a future upgrade will address these easy-to-fix usability issues.As to whether or not I would get her this again I would go with \"definitely\".

I own the 2nd generation Kindle, followed by the original Kindle Fire, and then this one. When I opened the box, I couldn't believe how thin and light they had made it. The Kindle worked great. Loved the screen resolution. Much sharper than the original. Wireless seemed to have a better connection to the Internet as well. I downloaded a number of my books, music, and most of my apps. One thing I was surprised to discover was that some of the apps I paid for were not in the cloud for me to download. It would be one thing if it was a free app of the day, but was really hoping to move all my apps to this one as I was running out of room on the original and had to leave most of my apps in the cloud. Overall the new Kindle is a great little tablet. I have an iPad with 64GB and I have to say I like using this better since it is as sharp as my retina display and had almost all of my books and apps that I use. Plus it is a better overall value.One strange thing that I have noticed is that some of the apps may not be designed for the higher resolution screen. I have a word search app which you cannot see all the letters. On some other apps, the screen is smaller and hard to read. I will patiently await to see if the designers will address this. Not an issue, as it only happens on a few of them. Overall, I can access and use about 85% to 90% of the apps without any issues.Even though I have had a few challenges, I would still recommend this to others. It is a great light weight tablet that I will be using daily.", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "This is so much better than carrying a thick book around with me!", "Author": "Denyse Rose", "ReviewID": "RKR3HW1U0H7L5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm from way before computers came into the world.

However, you need to go into buying a kindle HDX with eyes wide open: it is NOT a traditional tablet.  You are signing up for the Amazon ecosystem and the straightjacketing that involves.On the pro side: great price, brutally fast performance, great graphics, excellent selection of apps, books, and content in general.On the con side: no customizing the wallpapers or lock screens, and generally a black box system (short of rooting your system and voiding your warranty, there is little freedom to customize).  The biggest issue I have is no Google play store access.

I got it to take advantage of the lending library, Amazon prime (eventually when I feel like taking the $79 annual hit), and the features it does offer.

The video quality was awesome. It was the video that they had on the demo model that was crap. Yes the new HDX models have that blue border when reading books. The solution to that is changing the background color to back with white letters. If there is one thing negative I can say about this particular model its the size. While using it to browse the web, I realized maybe the 8.9 model would be a touch better just bc it is bigger. But if you are used to using a cell phone to browse the web then its not really an issue bc u would be used to swiping around a web page. And one more thing. Why not put a second camera on this thing like the 8.9? That would make more sense. That would make the HDX 7 awesome! IMO, the only choice you have to make is which HDX to buy.

May", "ReviewID": "R2AQU6NH2GG4A5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just received the seven-inch Amazon Kindle Fire HDX (64 GB, Wi-Fi, Includes Special Offers) today and have been using it now for about four hours. This review will evolve as I continue to use the device, but my initial impressions are...this is a fantastic device for the money.I still own a first-generation Kindle Fire whose stock OS and user experience were so bad I had to eventually root it and install stock Android Jelly Bean on it to make it usable. That Amazon has progressed from that to this in two years' time is remarkable.If you're worried about value, don't: just buy one if you think you want one (that's kind of a quote from a photography expert who has a blog and reviews a lot of gear). The value for the money here is incredible.Here are my pros and cons, which I will expand upon as I return to this review and update it periodically as I do more with the HDX.PROS:+ The screen. I've been trying to get an hour's worth of work done at the office, but I just can't take my eyes off the display. It is gorgeous, bright, sharp, accurate. Everything the pro reviewers have said about this display is true, but it doesn't prepare you for the actual first glimpse. It's an awesome panel.+ The sound. I fired up \"Smokey and the Bandit\" and was perplexed by the quality and volume of sound coming from the seemingly tiny speakers on the back of the device. Despite their location, it seems like the sound is coming right out of the screen. The engineers knocked a homerun here. Unless you're practicing privacy, headphones or external speakers are not essential.+ The design. The tapered edges give the device an ultra-slim appearance when viewed from most angles from the front side of the device, yet the body has sufficient thickness to be gripped and held easily. When the screen is off, it is very difficult to see the screen's location within the bezel...like a solid sheet of black. It is well-built, but it is light. And it's balanced well--I'm using an old Incipio stand originally designed for a Galaxy Nexus phone with the HDX, and it's perfectly stable and solid.+ Ease of use and setup. Within five minutes of unboxing, the device was ready for use, and that included downloading an OS update, setting up two email accounts, a Facebook account and a Twitter account. Amazon's ability to pre-register the device prior to shipping is huge.CONS- Blue screen edges. Most of the time they're not distracting, and I understand that they're \"necessary\" given the fact Amazon chose to use blue LED's to illuminate the screen and ensure close-to-100% color accuracy. But when browsing webpages or reading books, at my present stage of HDX enjoyment, they are a bit of a distraction. I'm hoping I get used to them. (10:56 AM, 12/23/13)- Amazon's app ecosystem. This is not a knock on the device but rather an indictment of Amazon's app store. But my hunch is that with the HDX devices developers will get cracking on making the freshest versions of apps available for Kindle Fire devices sooner and in greater quantity. Specifically, Spotify is ages old compared to the current versions available for iOS and Android, and more seriously crippling is the fact that the version Amazon offers does not support Spotify's new free-listening initiatives for mobile devices and tablets. Let's hope this improves soon.More to come...but again, this device at the price Amazon is asking is simply a no-brainer.

I was interested in the Samsung Note 8 (played with for a little bit at Best Buy). But Amazon offered me a 30-day free trial with a Kindle of my choice and I found that this was too tempting to pass up! Being an Amazon Prime member is awesome and it's truly the best way to get the full Kindle HDX experience! My 30-days are almost up and I plan on keeping my Kindle HDX. Here are my reasons why:1. MayDay. How awesome is this! I used this feature because I was having issues with one of my apps. The attendant came up as soon as soon as I pressed connect and was very patient and understanding while I was trying to explain my issue. Eventually I did have to get on the phone and speak with someone else but the attendant stay with me even while I was discussing my problem with the rep to make sure the rep understood what the issue was. This is by far the best thing about this device hands down!2. Amazon Prime. If you are a Prime member then you already know that you can get free movies and shows but if you have a Kindle device you can also get free books through the lending library (this was new to me!) and there are a tones of books to choose from. Going back to the movies and shows, I like that I have the option of downloading them onto my Kindle for travel (great feature for kids!) or going places where I know I won\u2019t have access to Wi-Fi.3. Shopping experience. I shop a lot through Amazon (which is why I am a Prime member) and this device just makes it incredibly easy to do just that. I think the Amazon coin option for purchasing apps is a great idea and have used them on a few apps for my kids.The only down sides of the Kindle for me are:1. There\u2019s no true YouTube app. I love YouTube and watch it pretty regularly. There are ones available in the kindle store but the best one I found so far (vTube?) doesn\u2019t quite function the same as the Google app on my iPhone. You have option of viewing YouTube through the Silk browser but a dedicated app that functioned more like (or better than!) the Google app would be ideal.2. You can\u2019t customize your home screen. You have this huge carousel thing at the top of the tablet\u2019s home screen and some (random?) apps that are at the bottom. I would like the option of at least customizing this screen since it\u2019s the first thing I see when the tablet unlocks.3. The ads are annoying. I wanted to see how I would respond to having the ads on the tablet to know if it was worth spending the extra $15 dollars to have them taken off. It is! It\u2019s annoying! My kids have seen some ads geared towards kids and ask for the stuff! We watch Netflix, Amazon, and ITunes content exclusively specifically to avoid advertisements and this has reminded me why we do!

For the price of a Kindle Fire HDX, you will not find anything better. I'm not a techno-wiz or anything like that, I've merely had the opportunity to use different types of tablets since members of my family keep winning them in drawings (e.g. Galaxy tab, Nexus, iPad, iPad mini). I actually bought this one because I wanted a tablet and it was less than half the price of the others when Amazon gave me special offers.I was initially worried about how complicated it might be to use, especially since I'm more familiar with the iPad interface, but I found the Kindle to be quite easy to operate. If I ever had a problem, I'd have the best customer support in seconds with the 'Mayday' button.It's fast- it's never really had a lag for anything that I've tried. The buttons are out of the way, but easy to find and use. The sound is by far superior to all other tablets, as is the display. It also feels better in the hand then other tablets.As with all non-iOS products, it doesn't have all of the apps or usability that I'd like, but that will come with time. Two notable apps that are absent from the market are Youtube and Instagram. I'm sure more developers will jump on board, especially since this tablet has proven to be extremely usable.If you are looking for larger text or screen size, the 7\" might be a bit too small. Also, if you aren't an Amazon Prime member, the Kindle might not have as many perks (e.g. instant video, lending library, etc). However, it still is great as a standalone tablet (although I'd recommend using the Prime services with your Kindle if you choose to purchase it; they are definitely worth the price).All in all, it's a top-tier competitor in the tablet market and it's also one of the cheapest. If you're considering this and the iPad mini or Nexus, really look into the Kindle or try it out.UPDATE (December 2013)I finally had the opportunity to use the Mayday service due to a downloading issue. It was about 10:30 PM. I tapped the Mayday button and within ten seconds I was in video contact with a representative from Amazon. In less than five minutes, they were able to visually show me the issue with my tablet and help me to solve it. I understood every word that they said (it wasn't outsourced) and it was by far the best tech-issue customer service contact I've ever had. I can usually solve any issues on my own, but having this feature for the times when I'm stuck is very nice.Many other reviews have mentioned the display issues at the border.

After spending only a few moments, from setup to navigating through various apps (books, web, videos, etc...), I must say that the device is near flawless.  The unboxing and setup process were as effortless as anyone could hope for.  The performance is spectacular and allowed navigating around the various screens with lightening quickness.  The feel in my hands is wonderful, in terms of size, weight, shape, and texture.  Heck, I even tried out the Mayday button and I must confess it is probably the greatest customer service experience I have had in memory and probably ever.Finally, I come to the topic that has been discussed in so many prior reviews.  This display is beautiful, vibrant and precise.  Unfortunately, this perfection is inexcusably blemished by an uneven purple haze around its outer edges.  This haze is almost twice as wide along one length of the device compared to the opposite side and contrasts so much with the otherwise flawless display, that it provides a distraction I cannot live with.I literally fell in love with your \"near masterpiece\" in just minutes.  So much so that I mentally tried to convince myself that the many fine attributes outweighed this single flaw (\"Gee, maybe I'll get used to it?\"), but alas I realize that, like so many others, this is something that I cannot bring myself to \"settle\" with.I am returning your amazing invention with great regret and I hope that your talented team can resolve this unacceptable issue as quickly as possible.

Then the first Gen Paperwhite that flickered, had uneven lighting that made it tough to read, and now this disappointing experience with not one, but TWO Fire's in a 5-week period.I really liked how the app was integrated with the Kindle store -- buying media was easy (in fact, I think I bought quite a few more books than normal, because shopping was so easy).In defense of the device -- people have complained about it as compared to an iPad and not being able to use it as a workhorse. The Kindle Fire is, according to CNET and others, a \"media consumption device\" rather than a \"tablet\". The Kindle is meant to be used for books, music, movies (all from Amazon, of course). It's not really designed to be an alternative to an iPad, more a compliment to the iPad -- one would use the iPad for work, the Kindle Fire for entertainment. And, I'm ok with that. I use my iPad a great deal, as I also use a MacBook and an iMac (and iPhone) so everything syncs together. Having the Kindle Fire let me free up room on my iPad -- getting rid of the books and music files freed up much needed room.I think, however, that I'm getting weary of Amazon Kindles. I like Amazon (though I think like any company it's driven by profit, not by concern for the customer).

The power and volume button being placed on the back is an odd design choice but one that you can get used to rather easily.

The 2 HDX's are the only Kindle products I've ever had to return. This has the potential to be a great tablet once the bugs are worked out.  The bugs consist mainly of dropped wifi connections, the tablet showing a pop up message that you're not connected to a network when the notification icon shows fully connected, and completely \"forgetting\" wifi networks on a regular (almost daily) basis.  The first one was \"buggy\" out of the box, and I had to do 2 factory resets before it would even connect to a wifi network and allow me to register.  I tried factory resets numerous times on the first one and finally returned it.  I then purchased another one and it functioned out of the box, but the wifi issues started within 24 hours.  I did a couple of factory resets and the issues persisted along with random restarts.  After researching the issue online, it appears to be common.  I contacted customer service...who are always fantastic simply to ask if they planned a software or hardware \"fix\" for these issues.  They offered to exchange the tablet.  In my experience, Amazon is always very quick to fix any software issues...but not so much for hardware.  The solution always appears to be to stand behind the hardware and exchange it if justified.  I've had fantastic experiences with their customer service department.  But then again we buy the majority of our groceries, toiletries, household items and gifts from them...so it's obvious we're very loyal customers.  But in this case after having the same issue with 2 units purchased 3 weeks apart, I opted to simply return the HDX and wait for future \"fixes\" or for my HD to break beyond repair.  My Fire HD still works great, and I don't need to spend $250 on a table with \"OK\" improvements that is buggy,  I read and watch movies.  The screen on the HDX is bettter than the HD, but the speakers aren't quite as good.  It's certainly lighter and detaches from the cover easier, but the Origami cover isn't true to the original.  The original \"origami\" cover would allow you to position the Fire in at least 3 positions including a slanted keyboard setting...the new one only does vertical and horizontal.  We use the video out on the Kindle HD a lot while travelling so the kids can watch \"safe\" shows in hotels rather than risking the exposure to ^%&$ on hotel cable.  The HDX can employ a wireless device, but it has no mini HDMI out like the HD.  While the volume buttons on the HD were poorly positioned, at least you could reach them while holding the unit in it's case.  When using the Origami case with the HDX the buttons are covered.  So the HDX is faster, lighter, smaller, better screen, better UI, worse speakers, worse connectivity and buggy.  The HD is slightly heavier and larger, fantastic screen but not as good as the HDX.  But it's a 7\" screen...I'm still trying to figure out why anyone needs that high of resolution on a 7\" screen...but people want it on a 4.7\" phone so...  The HD has better speakers and connectivity.  For those interested, the HD can also be \"rooted\" without losing the Kindle UI or access to Prime instant video features.  As of the time of this review, \"rooting\" HDX has presented issues for those that don't REALLY know what their doing.  Of course I would never recommend doing this either way since it voids the warranty, but at least there are ways to get that other \"store\" on the HD without losing all the great Amazon features.  I would have liked the 8.9 tablet, but I think it is way too expensive when you can pick up a Nook HD+ for about 1/3 of the price.  It has the \"other\" lay store and is easily adapted via the SD card slot to access the Amazon app store.

I read about this issue while waiting for the delivery my 7-inch version while still using the 8.9-inch version and became concerned.

I expect to see several adapters shortly that will allow you to use the Miracast functionality to \"throw\" your Kindle screen on to your TV so that you can use the TV to watch movies that are running on your Kindle.  Miracast has to take the place of the missing HDMI out port that was included in the last Kindle Fire tablet.  All in all, this tablet is a noticeable step up from the last generation.  It is a fully functional tablet, and with the \"side loading\" of applications from the Google Play store you can use this tablet for just about any Android application (although some games from Google Play must be connected to Google Play in order to function).By the way...I used the Mayday function to ask about a setting on the tablet.  I was very impressed by how quickly I was connected to a technical support agent, and how helpful the agent was in answering my question.

I saw all of the complaints about the blue haze around page borders and the initial glitches in set up. I decided that the new and upcoming features were worth the risk. I am happy to say that I made the right decision! When my HDX arrived I was able to set it up with absolutely no problems. There were none of the difficulties with multiple reboots that I had heard about. Everything set up smoothly. Now, about that blue haze---on my HDX it is barely perceptible! It is there because I made a point of looking for it. But during normal use of the HDX I don't even notice it,and I use the regular white background for reading. I have found the Kindle HDX to be fast and it has a beautifully clear and sharp display. The only thing that was briefly a \"disappointment\" was the fact that one or two my most used apps were not available on the new HDX, however that has since been rectified and now everything works as it did on my Kindle Fire. So,overall, I am extremely happy with my Kindle HDX.

I was really looking for a smaller tablet that I could carry around in my purse  for email, calendar, facebook, internet etc. and the HDX has surpassed my expectations.  The lighter weight of this tablet is fantastic and feels great in my hands.  For the first time I have enjoyed reading books on the HDX, but still prefer my Kindle Paperwhite as my main reading device.  The display is gorgeous and I have enjoyed watching and listening (those little speakers sound awesome and an improvement over the original Fire) to missed episodes of my favorite shows.  I have to admit I was concerned that I wouldn't be able to retrieve my emails or google calendar after reading some of the reviews, but I didn't need to worry because it has worked great!  My kindle calendar, google calendar and the calendar app I use on my iphone have all synced beautifully and no matter what device I schedule on I know that all my devices are updated with the information.  I have had no issues with a flickering screen, WiFi connectivty etc. that I read in previous reviews.I love my Apple products and this is not a comparison between the ipad and Kindle.  I love my ipad, but it was to big and heavy to be transported and for a smaller tablet the Kindle HDX met my needs without breaking the bank (turned out to be bigger bargain with the $50 off deal on Cyber Monday).

The eink has no back light and it is strictly black and white.I had no problem copying all my books and documents from the old to the new using my computer.  I\u2019ve found that for just reading books the eink was a little easier to use was a lot lighter and the battery life was unbelievably long lasting almost a month between charges.  As for reading it takes a while to get use to the touch pad screen of the HDX and I find myself making a bookmark on every page which is a drag because if I fall asleep and the HDX drops I could be a hundred pages away or even on a different app when I sake up.  Yesterday morning I woke up to find I apparently bought the book I was reading when it had dropped from my grasp when I feel asleep.  Oh, this was easy to correct, so no harm done.  The only other negative things are its weight and battery life.  It feels twice as heavy as the eink and the battery life is poor at best, it has to be charged at least every day.Pros:The Mayday button is Great!  It didn\u2019t take me more than 15 minutes to get into trouble and rather trying to figure out what I had done wrong I pressed the Mayday button and had a person talking to me, explaining what was wrong and fixing the problem.  The app I was having a problem with this person had never seen before but yet stayed with me and helped me figure it out.  I had expected him to blow me off, after all how can he possibly know the intricacies if every 3rd party app, but he found a solution.  Kindle must be very proud of their Help Desk because it\u2019s one of the best around.  I\u2019ve had 2 other times I used Mayday and all the people that have helped found solutions, and were very courteous.Even though I love the eink reader for books the HDX overpowers with its apps and shear speed.  I find myself using the HDX to check Email, Contacts and my Calendar because it\u2019s faster than starting up my computer.  The Silk browser is 100 times better than the one on the eink.  The eink has only a handful of apps while the HDX is almost overwhelming with great apps.  The HDX has so much more to offer that I haven\u2019t gone back to my eink and never will.  Come on-- this thing plays music, videos, you can watch TV, browse the Internet, check your email, read newspapers and magazines, do work from the office and play games plus if you get into trouble there is someone at the press of a button that helps.

I have had ever version of it so far.  I love the screen....it is fantastic.  I like the layout.  I only see a bit of blue around the edges when I read a book, but it's really nothing terribly noticeable and it does not bother me any.  I like that it is thinner and lighter.  The only things I would change are:  I would have a HDMI port because that beats paying $50.00 for a converter to be able to watch movies on my TV.  I would not put the power button and volume buttons on the back, it's way to easy to touch them accidentally.  I like where they were before.  They were a bit less accessible before, but having a cover that put my kindle to sleep made it a mute point.  Also you can adjust the volume on-screen.  I would rather have the buttons where you can't touch them accidentally.  But none of these are game changers, it's still a better tablet than before even though I loved my Kindle HD also.  Hopefully Amazon will take these reviews to heart and use them when designing the next model.  It's a great value for the money!  I love it!  Update 1 month later:  I had problems with my first Kindle HDX, almost every time I changed it to Airplane mode off or on, it would turn off and then come back on to the home screen.  This was very annoying, so I returned it for another Kindle HDX.  The 2nd one had a blue spot on the screen that was like a small blue cloud that did not move and was there no matter what.  This changed the color of what I was watching or when reading, I could see it quite clearly.  I returned that Kindle also, because when you buy a brand new Kindle, it should work perfectly.  The 3rd Kindle that I got was REFURBISHED!!! The screen is fine, but guess what?  The airplane mode thing is happening with this one too, and guess what else - they will not take a refurbished Kindle back even though it was Amazon's mistake to send me one.  The offered me a partial refund instead, which I accepted, but I am not a happy camper.  A brand new product should not have these problems.  My Kindle HD never had any of these problems and still works just fine.  At this point I would really like to just return this Kindle HDX and wait until they work all of the bugs out of it and try buying it in about 6 months, but once again, they won't take it back for a refund.

I have to look for it to see it but it's very minor.  To be fair I do not read a lot on this, I use it for movies mostly, so I don't see the haze at all on anything but a stark white background.The buttons on the angled part of the rear are PERFECT for me.  Another thing that seemed to annoy others but it's a vast improvement from the way the buttons were hidden on the HD.  I had to hunt on my old HD for the buttons constantly and it was very frustrating.  The HDX buttons are concave so as to not push them by accident, the placement is perfect for easy use while holding the device.  I have never once turned it off by accident and I hold it from the back all the time.  I can see if you have a case that covers the back of the device that might block access to the buttons but this is not the fault of the Kindle, more of the case designer imo.The screen is beautiful, a definite step up from the HD when viewing them side by side.The audio quality is great with headphones and external speakers.  About the same as the HD.The battery lasts a LONG time (but also takes a while to charge up, even with the 9w charger)The speed of the device is excellent with the new quad core cpu.I had some issues with wifi dropping out from time to time but with the recent update to OS v3.1 that seems to be fixed.  fingers crossed.  I am very happy with the upgrade.  I got the 64G version (coming from the 16G HD) and it's so much nicer having all that space to download movies.  All in all, I was really on the fence about upgrading from the HD but am very happy I did.

Weiss", "ReviewID": "R2APBTNQ2YD910", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The kindle fire hdx exudes quality in every aspect of the device. I can honestly say that there is no other tablet that provides the value for the cost.Screen: 5 out of 5In order to really appreciate the screen, you need to download at \"best quality\" an hd show or movie from amazon prime. Then you need to compare it to an hd video on another tablet. The screen color and clarity is absolutely amazing.Sound: 5 out of 5Coming from an Apple device owner, I never expected much for sound quality from tablets until I got the kindle fire hdx. The sound is crystal clear and loud! I don't quite understand how it works because I have tried covering the sound ports but the sound is still loud like it may be coming from around the screen as well. Try it, you will be impressed.Build Quality: 5 out of 5You can tell that this tablet has a magnesium frame built in. There is zero flex when holding or moving the tablet around. Compared to the Nexus 7 which also has a rubberized grip, you can tell that the nexus 7 is plastic and the kindle is metal on the inside. The build quality rivals the iPad mini.Processing: 5 out of 5Phenomenal speed doing any task you can imagine. Everything is instant with no delay at all. Loading up videos on youtube is much faster than on an iPad, which is most likely due to the dual antenna wifi for the kindle hdx. There is zero stutter playing hd games like Fifa Soccer 14 and watching 1080p videos.Battery Life: 5 out of 5This was the one aspect I expected to suffer being that it is an android based device. Battery life never seems to live up to what the manufacturer claims because android seems to just drain the battery. I have been using the device for a couple days and so far, it really does live up to the claims. After watching several hours of video I still find the battery life around 80%. Charging is also quick. I expect that it will only take a couple hours to go from 0% to 100% charged.Overall: 5 out of 5This is THE tablet to own for 2013-2014. Amazon has set the price of the kindle fire hdx to dominate the tablet market. Unlike other tablets such as the nexus 7, the kindle fire hdx doesn't sacrifice build quality to bring the cost down. This tablet should honestly be $329 starting like the iPad mini, but Amazon is pricing the tablet to acquire market share and make back money from app, video, book, and Amazon purchases. Even if your not a prime member, you should buy this tablet and become a prime member because it is very worth it. With all the new kindle fire hdx owners, the Amazon prime showcase should expand significantly too as Amazon brings more content to customers.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great tablet!", "Author": "Dave816", "ReviewID": "RE9KID4RYJZKR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Outstanding 7\" tablet.

I like it a lot. As far as I am concerned it does everything better.  The only thing that could have been better is to have been able to afford the HDX with Wi-Fi. The display is very vivid and the sound is excellent. I should take a moment to explain that I use it mostly for reading. In the old Kindle I knew what % of the book I had completed. In this one I know the percentage and the number of pages I have to go based on my reading speed. Given that, I also like the Skype ability, the way the web and Facebook behave (much like on my computer) and it is fast. I had an occasion to use the Mayday button. It took less than 15 seconds for them to answer and the support person I talked to was very helpful.What would make me like it more? The charge access is a little (not a lot) hard to plug into. It is set at an angle, not straight in. Per the Mayday person (no that is not why I called) this is to keep people from damaging it.  The charge does not last as long as my previous Kindle so I have to charge it more often. I wish I could have my I-tune library  accessible from the HDX. Maybe I can some way.

I bought it primarily as a color reader. I have a Kindle Paperwhite that is about a year old. It was giving me some problems frequently freezing up, even after updating the software, though it would always restart successfully. Also, I use Kindle book loans and they can only be read on Kindle devices so the Kindle Cloud Reader apps for my laptop and smartphone can't be used. And, I knew from reading on my laptop that a color reader is desirable in some situations.The Kindle Fire is so much more than a reader. I was not looking for a full-function tablet, but the Kindle Fire has much more functionality than I expected. I brought in my email account, contacts and calendar, which is very convenient. The Silk browser quickly connects with the few sites that I use most: Amazon, NOAA weather, my public library, a couple of news accounts, for example. I still use my laptop for most web browsing and research but I think I could do more on the Kindle Fire if I wanted to. I've also downloaded a few games, which offer a nice bread from reading. While I don't normally watch Amazon Prime videos on my Fire, I did try it out. It loaded quickly, the picture was sharp, and the sound good.It works well for a reader, though the screen is a bit more reflective than the monochrome Kindles. It's very quick at loading books, page turning, and finding word definitions. A nice feature for word definitions is that it uses the source that it determines is most helpful - sometimes a dictionary and sometimes Wikipedia. Moving around in a book is very convenient thanks to a navigation menu that slides out from the left side of the screen.The battery life is good but playing games in particular will drain it. When reading a book I switch between my FIre and my Paperwhite to recharge the other and the syncing usually works well.In choosing between the HD and the HDX, I looked at both. The HD has a slower processor and that's very noticeable. The HDX screen image is clearer and sharper. For me there was no question that the HDX was worth the additional cost.The case and screen are very smooth, which I like. However, I was concerned that they could be scratched or otherwise damaged, even though I'm careful with my devices. I bought the rooCase slim shell origami case for it and am very pleased with it. It fits well, adds very little weight or bulk.I recommend the Kindle Fire HDX for reading and so much more.", "Date": "May 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "WOW!", "Author": "cb5020", "ReviewID": "R2M9RHRHYB9EJT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I LOVE Amazon!....I ordered my Kindle one day, got it the next day, talk about fast, you just can't beat it!...every product I've bought from Amazon it's self has been excellent.....I have NO complaints about the company what so ever!...My Husband has Alzheimer's I got him one and down loaded a lot of games and he plays with it all the time, its been real good for him, it gives him something to do that he enjoys so very much, he is like a kid in a candy store.AND I LOVE my new Kindle that came today, the pictures are amazing, can't say enough about it.

I've owned Kindles in the distant past and have not been impressed with e-readers or tablets in general.  I'm an old-fashioned book reader and really didn't think I'd like an e-format.  Plus, I wasn't convinced that I needed another electronic device since I have a laptop.  When Amazon pitched the no-interest offer over 5 payments, I reluctantly ordered the Kindle.  I have to travel soon and the thought of lugging my usual pile of books was not appealing.  I have been absolutely blown away by the functionality, ease and intuitiveness of this little device.  I used it right out of the box and put it through a good workout.  In the few days that I've had this, I've already received a $3 offer for free music (which I snapped up right away) and a free book (which I learned comes once per month - cool).  I've downloaded free books - classics that I've really wanted to read.  I've watched my Prime Videos and Netflix and the sound without headphones is remarkable!  I'm a news junkie and most of my news apps were available.  I like the Silk browser, and for what I need it for (checking and answering email), it works.  I don't game, so I don't know much about these functions.  You save a bit when you order with \"the special offers\" included and they're not annoying at all - in fact, that's how I learned about the free books.  In hindsight, I'd probably go up in size to the larger Kindle if I ordered again.  My husband has an IPad and I have to say, I like this Kindle so much better!  I also recommend getting a cover for this - it's a good investment.  I saved a bit by buying off brand, but you might want to invest in a true Kindle cover to protect your device.

First of all it's only there on a complete white screen. Secondly, it's barely there, and you have to look for it. It's non in your main focal point, so you're never going to REALLY see it. I can't say this enough: It's very minimal! If no one mentioned it, you probably wouldn't even notice that it's there. The other things that the Kindle is great at completely overshadow this.The app store has plenty, and it's only getting more. With a little research you can get whatever Android app you want. For example, I like Chrome for web browsing, and I was able get the app on my Kindle in a couple of minutes.Being a Prime member, and able to download prime instant content is awesome.

I wanted to try out the Kindle since I've read so many reviews that mentioned that it was a perfect tablet for anyone who had a Prime membership.The tablet itself is pretty comfortable to hold. Some other reviews mentioned the ill placed power and volume rocker on the back of the tablet, but I found it intuitive after a few minutes of use.The screen is where the tablet really shines. HD movies looked, and the speakers were some of the loudest I found on a sub 8 inch tablet.The OS is quick and responsive, but the whole carousel layout feels a bit cumbersome, but it's merely a minor gripe.I think the only major flaw I found on this tablet was the lack of micro SD expansion. I purchased the 16 GB, and I was immediately bothered to realize that I only had around 10 GB of actual storage to use. 16 GB's of minimum storage should have been removed a long time ago. With HD streaming being the preeminent way of enjoying movies, it should have come as no surprise that most 1080p movies were going to be larger than the 10 GB that remained. I don't see why they couldn't add a small slot for an expansion. This is where the HDX falls to the Samsung Note 8.0.Other than that, it's a nice little tablet... I do have a little buyer's remorse.

The size difference between the two is practically negligible as is the weight difference (the HDX7 is slightly larger and about 8 ounces heavier).  I can hold the the HDX7 in my left hand quite comfortably--just not quite as comfortably as the Paperwhite.  Moreover, the text of the Paperwhite \"seems\" to wear longer on older, tired eyes (especially after reading the hype on behalf of e-ink text) than that of the HDX--at least during extended stretches of continuous reading.Still, there are moments when my eyes crave color, images and videos beyond which the Paperwhite can deliver.  The television set, cable, and ROKU box are my wife's, and I'm no longer doing as well by watching movies or concerts on the severely restricted real estate of an iPod screen--all of which doubles the attraction of a tablet like the HDX.  It offers the freedom and privacy of an iPod but with video footage that offers a welcome size-advantage compared to the iPod screen.For traveling purposes, I'm good with the Paperwhite and an iPod--both pocket-sized and answering to my reading, listening  and occasional viewing needs.  The speakers of the HDX may be stereo but they're far from full-frequencied, perhaps only slightly better than those of a new iPod Touch.  So I'd recommend earphones when using either an iPod or the HDX as a music player--or, if your partner won't complain, a good adjunct speaker (with a supple, light cable for better sound and more reliable connectivty than dicey Bluetooth technology offers).I frankly can't \"see\" an iPod or tablet performing the many functions of a computer or a camera (I'm one of the ever more conspicuous minority who still carry a dedicated \"point and shoot\" camera).  But the price point of the HDX makes it an affordable luxury device for dedicating to specific and occasional uses.  I've met people who no longer use any sort of computer, doing all of their Facebooking, e-mail and banking with a mere tablet (usually an Apple iPad or Mini).  My sense is that the HDX would prove slightly more cumbersome for such purposes--Apple's tablet has the refined processor, continually upgraded OS, and widely established ecosystem to make it a better bet for most users thinking of ditching their laptops.  Aside from the added cost of the Apple tablet (twice as much as the HDX), I'm simply not excited about tablets in general.  The affordability of the HDX, which has now got several years of refinement behind it, makes it the preferred choice in my case.In conclusion, I've got to rate the Paperwhite #1 for my particular uses as well as for Amazon's scoring a game-changing consumer technology coup second only to the release of the first Apple iPod in 2002 and the Macbook Air in 2008 (though it was not accepted by the general public until Apple's decision to ignore the naysayers and release it again in 2010).  Not only is the Paperwhite small, versatile, fast-loading, and beautifully back-lit (no more fumbling around and experimenting with various clip-on lights), but there's no subscription charge for long-distance connectivity to Amazon.  And I find it reassuring that Amazon includes an official, no-charge, on-line \"User's Manual,\"  for printing out on a Mac computer. With the HDX, on the other hand, there appears to be no single authoritative and \"free\" User's Guide.  Instead, your choices for instructions are unlimited--and I would advise against proceeding intuitively, especially if you plan to make use of Amazon's uniquely integrated film commentary, thanks largely to Bezos heady and timely purchase of the popular IMDB reference source.

The \"blue led\" and purple/blue/violet bleeding on the edges of the screen caused, at least for me personally, eye-strain and distraction (I wear 1.5-1.75 power readers).  I compared this side-by-side to a 7-inch Kindle HD and original Fire and these, as e-readers, were far superior.  When I contacted customer support I was told the blue led was intentional and that if I ordered a replacement it would still have the purple-blue edge.  If \"intentional\" use of a blue led means this wasn't thoroughly tested as an e-reader and is actually a major design flaw, then mission accomplished.  Since ~75%+ of my Kindle use is as a reader (25% video, email, apps), I returned this and am using my \"antiquated\" Kindle Fire.  I am hopeful the next generation will provide a spectrally pleasing balance of reading, web surfing, and video.  As technology, whether using at home or traveling, as an 80s teen and an avid SciFi/Fantasy reader I never thought I would see this. Considering this observation, a violet-colored edge and blue led affecting a white reading background is a minor complication, but does negatively affect the here and now of usage as an e-reader.The 7\" HDX does have amazing video pixel density and sound.  Much, much better than the 1st gen Fire and a readily observable improvement over the 7\" HD.  The speed of the HDX is fast compared to it's predecessors and Mayday, which I used for the purple-blue edge, far exceeded my expectations.  I never tested the camera before returning. I have found a very strong WIFI receiver with all generations of Kindle -- superior to my iPhone.  If you're not using the 7\" HDX as an e-reader, the value and quality is a comparably remarkable value.  If you plan to do a lot of reading, well, just don't go HDX; stick with the HD or original Fire or Paperwhite.", "Date": "May 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good but not great", "Author": "Pen Name", "ReviewID": "R3IRCF2HQWWYKF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Overall I'm pretty happy with the Kindle Fire.

I looked at the various types of Kindles. First I wanted a system that I could read in dark bedroom. Second, To get comparable internal memory to the newest tablet devices(32 GB), Third, the ability to change font & background color. Fourth, to be able to use the device on the internet. I got all of these features with the features with the Fire HDX.Given, I have an Amazon card which at the time provided $40 rebate on the HDX. I would have spent it for extra 16 GB anyway. The device has a three tier color format for color of font/background. I like the brown font on a light tan background which does not have the typical white background glare.  The HDX is perfect for a dark room.The SILK internet browser provides easy access to e-mail or wherever you want to go on the internet; Don't expect a Windows/Android type internet functional capacity but SILK is very good for things one would want to check before bedtime or any other time. The 7\" display is perfect for reading & mimics the normal size of a paperback; the size of words is easily adjustable to your personal choice or increasing to the size of hardback letters or bigger.The HDX is the first tablet I have owned that displayed perfectly at 50% setting(major reduction in battery charge drain) vs typical 90% to 100%. The HDX does not need to be charged till after 8 or 9 nights of 2-hour reading sessions. I turned off the WI-FI(10 second task) unless I need it for a book download or to go on the Web which greatly reduces the draining of the battery charge. I was a hardcore Hard Back reading but I love the HDX & have found myself putting off reading previously purchased books. The HDX has revolutionized my reading & I read 100% more now. I keep my Kindle in a zipped sleeve when charging or not in use. The sleeve also protects Kindle from the elements, display scarring & dropping. I highly recommend a similiar Kindle HDX to anyone who wants Kindle & internet access in the same device.  Somewhat of an answer to questions about  'archiving', 'collection', 'cloud', 'how to tell if a book is downloaded', 'remove from device' & 'remove a book, magazine, etc completely removing a item from your Kindle', etc.Put a note at start & end of the book to indicate you have read it when the carousel is on screen & you actually in the book. Press one to two seconds the book on carousel & move the book to 'Add to Collection'. Add a new folder in 'Collection' titled 'read' or 'red' or what ever title you want, check this folder to move the book you have finished to that folder by checking the folder & then save. Then press 'Remove from Device' which also pops up in the menu where you press the book for a second or two. That moved the book from being downloaded to your Kindle & into the 'CLOUD', the book title is still on your Kindle by being in your Amazon 'Cloud' but not using up your Kindle memory", "Date": "May 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire HDX 7\"", "Author": "Shirley McCammon", "ReviewID": "R3JXBPHYB9EM3C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love it .

I expected to only use it as an e-reader, but it turned out to be one of our best electronic purchases ever.  That Kindle went with us to many interesting places over the years.  It's small enough to fit easily in a purse or a hotel safe, so it was our family's take-along device when traveling. With the reasonable price and small size, it was perfect for trips.  Free game apps keep the kids entertained on a rainy day of a beach vacation, not so expensive (compared to an iPad) that you worry about it being stolen when it's in the hotel room or broken while sneaking in one last roller coaster ride before heading to the Orlando airport.  The Acrobat Reader app allowed me to take hundreds of pages of work-related reading material with me to Europe without having the extra weight in my suitcase.  I read a lot, and my local library has thousands of books available to borrow for e-readers, a very nice supplement to the ones I've purchased for Kindle.  The untimely death of the previous Kindle was my fault: I dropped it, glass-side down, onto a ceramic tile floor and the glass shattered.  It's still working, but now in a plastic freezer bag so I don't get (more) glass shards in my fingertips.Now that I know what my Kindle needs are (50% reading, 50% apps and web surfing), I chose the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" as the replacement.  I  considered the iPad and iPad Mini, but this Kindle has more features and better resolution for a lower price.  I also looked at the larger Kindle Fire, but I really need my e-reader to fit in one hand, so the larger size is a disadvantage.  We own Apple products, so it's not like we avoid them, Kindle Fire HDX 7\" better suits my needs as an e-reader and tablet.Several things have been upgraded on this one compared to the earlier model.  My favorite is the ability to categorize books.  I have a pretty big library already on the cloud, still working on downloading and sorting through the books.  The screen resolution is better, not meaningful for reading but great in combination with Amazon Prime movies and apps.  I haven't had reason to use the camera yet, so no comments on that.  I also haven't tested the battery life on this one, but on the previous version I found that the battery lasted much longer when the wi-fi was turned off.I am very happy with this new Kindle.  The screen size allows great portability and it can be held in one hand, not too much bigger than a paperback.  Battery life is fine, screen resolution is beautiful  Available apps are great.  This time around I also purchased an Otterbox case, so I hope to not have another review to write anytime soon.", "Date": "April 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "KINDLE rocks.

The Dolby sound quality from the speakers is phenomenal for so small a device, but the volume level doesn't go very high and at its top volume it is only what I would consider as being barely satisfactory.  If there is any background noise at all you will have problems hearing it unless you are using earphones or a headset.  My biggest complaint about the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" is the location of the on/off button and the volume control. Both of these controls are under the sloped edge of the pad and if you have a leather cover for your Kindle Fire you pretty much have to remove it from the cover to access these controls.  I think the unit would be better if the control switches were on the edge like they had with the old B&W; 7\" Kindle with the keyboard.  I'm finding that to get a nice leather cover like want I am having to have one custom made.  One other item that I think would make the Kindle Fire HDX better would be a USB port that allows you to use a Flashdrive with it.  This would allow you to access movies and documents from an external source without having to use a computer to transfer them via a cable.  I have a lot of movies on DVD's that I wanted to view on my Kindle Fire HDX 7\" when I travel, I was able to find a program to convert them to MP4 format, but I discovered that when stored in the \"myflix\" folder on the Kindle I need to use the PHOTO selection on the Kindle to find them and not the movie selection, this is rather confusing especially since no instructions came with the Kindle.  Once you get over these slight inconveniences the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" is a fun and useful media reader.", "Date": "April 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Replacment", "Author": "Frank Butts", "ReviewID": "R3N6NLPHPG99ZX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The wife finally wore out the old fire so it was time for an upgrade,  got to say I'm envious of the new HDX,  Just might have to get one for me.", "Date": "April 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice Upgrade", "Author": "Tiffany", "ReviewID": "R1VXVERD00AI3P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had the old first kindle fire, that I got in 2012, no HD, bulky, and kinda heavy after I got this new one. It was having some issues, and I honestly don't think I was getting updates on it anymore. Things were just going a little down hill with the old kindle, was having freezes, and just wasn't going as fast as it could have been.What I love about my old and the new one is that I can use it as a tablet and well as an e-reader. I love love love that this new one looks more defined and more clear to me. It is a very nice upgrade. I love that it is so much smaller, and sleek. The only thing that I am not used to is the power button and the volume button being on the back. I will over time though get used to it.Battery life seems to do well, depending on your brightness. I took it with me to the lake over the weekend and didn't have to charge it once over the weekend. I only used it at night, and a few times during the day. It also charges pretty fast compared to the other kindle fire.  I also love that I can have my gmail, hotmail and pop3 emails set up on my kindle. The camera works well.

Now the reason I wanted the smaller screen was because when I read my books I want to really feel like im reading a book sized object which is a better fit for me and makes a difference in my reading. This dissapointed me alot because I spend alot of extra money to pay for the 32 GB to take pictures on it but I cant really take any pictures of use with the front facing camera. The rear facing camera would make my 32BG purchase choice more useful. SO that was extremely dissapointing.  #2 when playing games on my kindle about 50% of the time the game will start flashing slightly but enough to really annoy me and make me think that something might be wrong with my device. But when calling mayday I was basically told to just call them back if it happens again but in reality it doesnt matter because of course you would have to catch it at the right time in order to show the may day people what you're talking about. The flashing that happens during the game is a random act and not something that can really be shown unless catching it at the right time which is unlikely.other than those two things, I really love my kindle as I do amazon but the two issues stated above really bug me since I really support amazon and have probably influenced 7 people at this point to buy Kindles as well as the prime membership within the past few years and probably only felt maybe 80% satisfaction from my current kindle.", "Date": "April 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "It's hard for me to get the hang of some of the basic functions.

The processor is amazingly fast and the graphics engine is top of the line.  Response times are instantaneous and I have found no lag in the OS.  I'm not sure how they do it but the sound and volume on this thing is incredible.  The keyboard has swipe built in and it works well plus I also like the ease of adding new words to the dictionary. The ability to add your own words to the dictionary is incredibly useful for customizing your Kindle Fire to be adapted to your personal way of thought and speech. If you are a member of Amazon Prime the Kindle Fire is a one stop experience for shopping, books, games, and video. The real problem is in the limited OS that Amazon has created to push its app store.  This could cause problems for people who are, like myself, used to the full access of the Google Play store which you cannot use. This also means that apps that are free on Google Play might cost you money on the Amazon store. This tablet also doesn't have flash along with all modern Android and Apple products. Flash is available on Windows tablets if that is something you need. Gaming seems to work well except for some second screen features, like Battlefield's Commander app, on my Xbox One. Second screen does allow me to use the Kindle Fire as a keyboard and mouse for the Xbox One which makes surfing the web and navigating menus much easier.

To have a person who can hear your voice answer your questions immediately, and solve your issue within seconds is just invaluable to this busy mom.  No more email back and forth conversations with customer service reps that didn't read the entirety of my message or didn't answer my question fully, necessitating a problem solving session lasting for days.  A person and a voice that can respond immediately is a breath of fresh air.  I would have given the Kindle HDX 3 or 4 stars before using Mayday (mostly because I prefer the Mac look but and feel and probably should have bought an ipad mini) but this service is just so impressive and beats having to go to a genius bar and wait in line for 45 minutes or more that I'm completely sold on the Kindle.", "Date": "March 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome!", "Author": "Eva \"Eva\"", "ReviewID": "R1UIHN524VIQII", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I absolutely love it!

First, it doesn't give one the entire 64 gb. This is normal as formatted memory systems go, but where the misleading part comes in is that these also use storage memory for operating memory. Thus, when I downloaded so much that I only had 4 or 5 gb left, the device froze up and took forever to play streaming videos and execute files. This means that you don't get the entire memory block for storage, but that you must reserve a considerable amount of it just to operate the bloody thing!When it first began to bog down, I asked the Mayday people for assistance. They led me through a litany of things which did no good. Then when they suggested resetting the device, I asked if it would remove any of my content. No, absolutely not, they said. So I reset the device and the movies began streaming without a hitch. Great! Only when I went to my on device video library, everything I'd downloaded was gone -- almost 50 gigs of data! So I downloaded everything again and now my system barely moves.The video experts told me I should be able to fill my entire storage, but this isn't apparently true. Thus, when you buy a quality Android device that has 8- or 16-gb of memory with a storage of up to 64 gbs with an SD card,  you're getting a better system memory-wise. As far as the video help, out of five calls, three were with people who spoke such poor English that communication was all but impossible. If I'd had a heart attack while on the phone with them and needed their help, I'd be dead.If this device had an SD slot, this thing would get a raging 5-star review. But tech support is wanting, my memory is only about two-thirds of what I was expecting, and this thing isn't that fast. It requires a lot of memory, and that memory comes from the storage, regardless of what I'd been told. You may want to skip this until Amazon gives truthful specifications. I wouldn't buy it again.", "Date": "March 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "LOVE!!!", "Author": "Veronica", "ReviewID": "R2GM0Q2QD9OZIK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Okay, seriously, had I known how awesome this thing was going to be I would have went all out with the 8.9\" 64 GB!!

On smaller tablets I prefer the Kindle form factor as I find it easer to hold in any orientation without worrying about accidental screen touches/activations. When purchased I assumed root access and perhaps an alternative ROM would eventually be needed. Turns out a different launcher (Apex or Nova) and a few side loaded apps from 1Mobile were all that was required. Didn't even need to root my HDX which technically voids Amazon's warranty. The \"Mojito\" operating environment is more flexible than earlier Amazon/Fire ROMs; most Android apps run perfectly with exception to the Play store (admittedly a biggie) and some Google creations. I can live without those. And I still have easy access to Prime movies and a few native Amazon apps that I happen to prefer.

My wife was able to try out the 8.9\" KF HDX and while the movies were beautiful on it the size was not for me since I read a lot, so I got the 7\"Screen = sexySound = It's a mobile device so I dont expect anything spectacular, that is where ear buds or headphones come into playCPU = Speedy little thing, quite impressedBuild Quality = SolidBattery Life = Great but like everyone else I want longer! :)Storage = 64GB and am happy Amazon offers this size and would love to see a 128GB or 256GB model in the future.OS = meh...... Read about it below.Bluetooth = WinWiFi = stable and solid I am an Android user and I like stock Android. I understand Amazon is trying to make it usable for anyone of any age sort of deal, but my biggest gripe is the freaking carousel (please fire the person/s responsible for this decision!!!) Please make a way to customize or just flat our disable for your customers that cant stand it. Second is the silk browser... I mean really come on! Why not use the default browser or Chrome that is part of Android, they are decent and average browsers that dont have issues with 60% of websites when loading them or hanging on the other 40% at random times. I just use Firefox Mobile to resolve this issue. Third and this is more of a personal issue that pops up from time to time since I got the Kindle Fire HDX and that is the seemingly constant need to be connected to the internet. When I am at home not a problem, when I am on the road really not a problem as I can use a hotspot (but do I really need to?), when I am at work that is really impossible as I have to keep it in airplane mode if I want to even bring it with me. This poses an issue sometimes when it needs to verify licensing to run some apps or play some games during lunch or waiting for code to compile, to watch a movie I downloaded from Amazon VOD so I could watch it while away from a data connection or a limited data connection in terms of data amount I can use. This needs to be resolved with all digital content that is usable on the KF HDX. I dont really have this issue when I use my Nexus 7 unless the app/game I am trying to run requires an internet connection for it to actually function due to the nature of the app/game.OK now that I got my negative out of the way lets add a few more good things to this rating.The app/game selection is pretty darn good, the game circle is cool but Amazon and Google need to make a love connection here with games that support G+ syncing so I can keep my saves of Reaper on my Android devices and KF HDX device. Don't think I need to play two separate games due to that (or at least make a way to export/import gave saves between the platforms). Digital content in terms of movies/shows and also music is great. I buy 99% of my content from Amazon as I can play the music on any platform and then stream video content to any platform. Then with the purchase of BR/DVD/Digital from the store if I cant add it to my Amazon digital library, then the support of flixster and such is available.I love reading books on this device, I have a ton of book I have purchased through Amazon and then ones I have as PDF from technical books I can send using the kindle address or side loading it. The good reads inclusion of the app is not as robust as the Android version or the website but it will do and it does let you see some other books based off of comments, ratings, and similar interest when you are looking for something a little outside your normal scope.Hope this helps other customers!", "Date": "February 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "A Got To Get", "Author": "Jeanne Klohr", "ReviewID": "R3TED0Z4OJJRG5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I wanted the HDX, I thought I would get the 8.9 display.

The screen is brilliant and beautiful, except for a few features which are not so pleasant.The purple/blue bleed people talk about, its real.  It is annoying and distorting.  I only read books in night mode, where the background is black, so the blue doesn't show up.The second issue is that in a large number of non-native apps, the screen flickers.  Sometimes it is just a little bit, once in a while, but in some apps, it can get to the point where it is so consistent that it gives an almost instant headache and makes the app unusable for more than a couple minutes.  I did find, however, that just hitting the power button and then turning it right back on again (so that the screen turns off but not the kindle itself) can temporarily get rid of, or at least greatly reduce, the flicker.Honestly, the display issues really make it feel like a cheap tablet.  Which is disappointing.  My wife has a first generation nexus 7 and I wish I'd gone for a second gen of that instead of the HDX.  We've found no issues with that tablet in the year-and-a-half she's been using it.A big upside is the ability to download free prime movies and tv shows (the downloadable ones are a much smaller subset of the free prime videos, but as someone who watches little tv, there's plenty there that I've never seen that will last me for a long time) which means having the ability to watch movies on the plane, in the airport, or in the train without internet.In all, the kindle is a good entertainment device for videos, but the screen issues mean it falls short of expectations in other areas, including reading and writing, which I'd expected to use my kindle for quite a bit.

I did a LOT of research before I made my purchase and decided that this Kindle was the best fit for me. I was not disappointed!There are a few drawbacks:1. No SD card slot so on-board memory is all you get. This isn't a problem for me, since I don't have a whole lot of apps and cloud storage is available. (LOVE the cloud storage!!)2. Google apps are not supported. Reportedly people have gotten them to work on their Kindle but I wasn't able to get them going. I adapted - I get my Gmail via browser and use an alternate mapping app.3. Battery life isn't quite what I'd like, but manageable.Now for the pros:1. The size and weight is just right. It is comfortable to use - even hours on end like I do2. Clear, sharp images. I was quite impressed by how good things look on the Kindle Fire3. Cloud storage so if you get overloaded with apps or books, you can save them to the cloud for later retrieval4. A wide variety of apps will run on the Kindle Fire, ranging from games to Office apps.Once I got the Kindle Fire, I realized that I'd underestimated how much I'd use it. I not only use it for reading (which I do a lot!), but I also have Skype on it, several games, and a bunch of work-related applications. I use it to do some work-related tasks when it's not convenient to be at my computer. With the apps I've collected, I can do all of my work - even work that requires VPN -  on the Kindle - it's that good!I'll admit that the Kindle Fire is not for everyone. If you are expecting a full-blown tablet, you may not like this. It's total overkill if all you want to do is read books. If you absolutely MUST have the SD card slot or MUST run Google apps, then you should look elsewhere. However, if you are looking to read books and also watch movies or tv, play a few games, and run a few apps, then the Kindle Fire is an excellent choice.", "Date": "February 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "awesome!!!", "Author": "shannon", "ReviewID": "R2GS8O4UYL1GLD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just got it today and I love it!

First, it IS a fantastic device.  Incredibly versatile, lightweight, with an amazing screen.  I have always had (it's probably me) trouble using Apple products, as for me, they simply aren't as intuitive as others, and I don't like I-Tunes, so the HDX was a logical choice.  It is very reasonable in cost, and for those who need it, the Mayday feature is sure to be a big hit.  I've used it two times, (could have easily found the answer to my question myself, but wanted to give it a try) and the help Amazon gives IS all it's cracked up to be.  Very convenient. This device is super fast, and dependable.  I won't carry a cell phone, but with this, you can load on a free app from MagicJack, and you're good to go!  Free phone calls are always great, right?  So, why not five stars? As with most tablets, there are the occasional hang-ups while online, mostly while trying to view a video, say from Yahoo.  Can be frustrating if you're not ready to just let it go.....just don't need to see it that badly.  It can lock up the device.  Some videos DO work, but not all. Not a biggie though, just disconnect, get back on, and move on.  Hey, this can happen on my laptop, and who amongst us hasn't experienced that?  This aside, this thing is so easy to use, if you can work your laptop, or desktop, you won't have to learn a thing......no jumping through hoops like I-Tunes to load music......just drag and drop it from your laptop, and voila! Very intuitive. I bought, and suggest the 32gig model, just to be certain you'll have plenty of memory, as you cannot upgrade the memory.  The sound from the built in speakers is nothing short of amazing, and of course through the headphone jack as well.  Maybe I should have given it FIVE stars.  One last thing......I almost was set to pay for the 'NO OFFERS' (which you can also do at a later time if you don't do it when you first buy the Kindle) but was glad I didn't. The offers are GREAT, the screens shots are brilliant, and you find yourself looking forward to them when you power up.

Hockenbarger", "ReviewID": "R2QWZOMX7VK7Y6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought two of these, one for my wife and one for myself.  I love this tablet.  I've got multiple other tablets in the house for use by the 7 kids who have all but abandoned television to watch YouTube and other streaming media technologies, so I'm not new to tablet technology by any stretch of the imagination.The hardware is great. I wasn't sure about the 7\" size, but have found that I love it.  I certainly think larger tablets have their place, but the convenience of the 7\" form factor is really nice for media consumption (reading books and magazines, watching streaming video, etc.).  It fits in the hand easily, and for smaller kids the lighter weight and smaller size makes it easier for them to use when I want to loan it to one of the littler ones.  Battery life is okay, I went from full charge to around 60% after watching three TV show episodes back to back.  The display is crisp, colors bright; blacks could be a little deeper, but it's a 7\" tablet not a 4K TV!  Sound is good, but I still question why the only vendor on the planet that gets that you should put speakers on the front of the device is HTC.  This is SUCH a no-brainer and if you want the strongest possible device for media consumption, put the speakers on the front!  That aside, the back-side speakers are pretty effective and sound is crisp with a pretty good range.I like the fact the system has 5GHz WiFi, my other tablets are all 2.4GHz, so bumping up out of that spectrum was nice, especially for streaming performance.The skin on top of Android is one of the better ones I've seen, certainly better than Asus or Samsung's skins (but I haven't gotten an opportunity to play with the MagazineUX yet, which is similar to Windows tiles which I really like).  I'd like to see more configurability for the carousel.  I haven't quite figured out the logic behind how things get added to or removed from it.  For example I view a Prime Instant Video and it shows up in the carousel, but after I pause it and look at something else, it pulls it out.  I'd like to pin Prime IV to the carousel permanently, and I don't see a way to do that.Of course having access to all the ebooks I've been reading via the Kindle app on my phone is awesome, and my wife loves the Newsstand feature.One nit about the software is that it doesn't interface properly to my Prime Instant Video, particularly my Watchlist.  For some reason it isn't reading that properly, so it doesn't see that I've got all the seasons of Doctor Who, for example queued up for viewing in my Watchlist like it does if I log into the website.  Again, a nit.The main reason this doesn't get 5 stars is actually a huge issue to me.  Not having Google Play access is almost a show-stopper.  The refusal of Amazon to work with Google and play in the ecosystem relegates the Fire to a media interface device, and it cannot become my primary tablet device.  So instead of going into my backpack when I travel on business, it sits on my bedside table for media viewing and reading at night, because my larger Samsung tablet can do everything the Kindle does and more, albeit in a larger and heavier device.  The Amazon app store is simply deficient and weak compared to Google Play, and there are a LOT of apps I use that are not available, particularly around system administration.  Of course not having the native Google apps is a big kludge, especially for a person who has carried an Android phone for years, has multiple Android tablets, and is a big fan of that ecosystem.  Even Samsung understands that not allowing the native Android apps is a bad thing, and while they push their custom versions of things, still allow you to use Google Play.  If Amazon decided to go 10\" or so on a tablet, I wouldn't buy it for this reason alone.  Since I'm a geek, I don't mind having multiple devices, but for friends and family that want a single device for things beyond media consumption, I cannot recommend the Fire.  For non-technical users who want nothing BUT media consumption, the device rocks.And yes, I know I can sideload or I could root, but I don't want to have to go to that effort across multiple devices just to get proper Android access.Overall a very nice tablet implementation.", "Date": "January 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best on The Market", "Author": "Cindy Clark", "ReviewID": "R1ZA72FAD48COE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After owning several tablets,cheap to rated the best.

I couldn\u2019t really surf the internet, magazines and pictures wouldn\u2019t work on it well and it was black and white.  Pretty sure you know the rest.Kindle Fire:  I don\u2019t by the first of anything because it will improve and become cheaper.  The biggest issue with the kindle fire was it didn\u2019t have a reader and I do use that often.  The front page was a bookshelf which is ok but couldn\u2019t organize like the reg kindle.Kindle Fire HD:  I hate the carousel on kindle fire HD.  It\u2019s a circle of icons in which the last thing you opened goes up there.  Want it or not.  You can delete from the carousel but something else will pop up there that is on your device. It has a set number of icons it wants there and it will keep it filled.  Grrr.  I wish it would just go away.  I liked how I could organize my books on the regular kindle.  That said, there are apps that make that happen so it makes life easier. You know there HAS to be an app for that!  Over all the organization isn\u2019t bad. It\u2019s simple to use.  My six year old can use it no problem. But then again, kids are born knowing these things today.  Being back lit vs light shining on the book isn\u2019t as easy to read as the original kindle was.  The back light can be adjusted way down which is a plus. I don\u2019t think this is a big issue to most people.  I\u2019m dyslexic and having dimmer light on the gray background rocked!  I could be a reading fool.  I can\u2019t read as long on this.  As I said though for most people that probably isn\u2019t an issue.  After my withdraw from my original kindle I love this one.  SO much more you can do with it!!  The battery doesn\u2019t last like the original but we are doing WAY more with this one than just read.  AND naturally there is an app for that!!!  There are battery savers that shut down what isn\u2019t needed and does make a difference in battery life.  Considering with I do however I think the battery isn\u2019t bad. I play music and a game at the same time or music and read, music and read.  I am asking a lot! I was use to the other battery lasting for weeks.  One plus is my phone charger works for the kindle.  I\u2019m just overall too happy with the upgrade to Kindle Fire HD.HD vs HDX.I got the HD with Ads because I didn\u2019t care to pay to not have them. I\u2019m really glad I did that.  I like the ads.  There were some movie and TV trailers that I would have otherwise missed.  Product ads you never know but they aren't annoying at all.My son bought the HDX.  He loves it.As far as I can tell the big difference is with the HDX you can have Wifi and cell towers.  Oh and the live help.  I asked if I could upgrade because it came out right after I bought my HD. The answer was no, I would need to sell it myself.  I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t need to use cell towers.  Some might where they live but I don\u2019t.  As for live help, once you learn your kindle do you really need that?  I didn\u2019t for the price difference.  Last I knew it was a good $200 difference.  I\u2019m sure the price will go down, the HD will be priced at peanuts and it will all balance out in time.  It seems about a year is when the big price change happens.Good luck with your new decisions!", "Date": "January 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "I had a Kindle Fire before", "Author": "Katgirl2", "ReviewID": "R3KM077T57GA51", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I used my Kindle Fire for 2 years before getting my Kindle Fire HDX.

I am about to buy a Asus tablet. My Asus tablet has a similar children's app to allow them each to have an account wit their own password.  This will allow them to log off each and allow the other to log in to their own account.  Second, you can't add memory.  Kindle solution is to have cloud storage.  wrong ideal.  Some apps like Real Racing is 4 gb.  After one month, I am out of memory without any videos downloaded from Amazon Prime.  We only downloaded six games.  Most other tablets can add a SD card to increase memory.  I own a Asus Transformer and love it. I just wish I bought them one.

I had no choice in the matter...The other 1/2 star it's lacking is an easy fix, and it flat boggles my mind that Amazon didn't include it in the programming  -  NO HAPTIC FEEDBACK OPTIONS?????????

It seems reasonable that there should be an easier (faster) way.  While I am computer \"literate\", it has been slow finding my way around all that the HDX offers.One of the reasons I selected the HDX was the availability of the Skype App.  When I installed it, however, Skype advised that they were blocking my account - because of a break-in that occurred in 2010. Everything was resolved by Skype and my bank, and I have been using Skype on my desktop ever since.  Working with Skype to unblock my account was endlessly frustrating.A minor point. I have used Every Word: Crossing on a previous Kindle.  I expected to use it on the HDX. However, after searching the Kindle website, I finally determined it was not compatible with the HDX. Subsequently, I purchase (it was free) the App Every Word - and received confirmation.  However, it was never delivered.  Your helpful tech determined that (again) it was not compatible with the HDX.  Not a crises - just a bit irritating.I have not yet used the Amazon Assist feature yet - but I think the offering is excellent.In one of the reviews I read before selecting the HDX, the reviewer commented that the On/Off button was in an awkward place - I agree.Thank you for the opportunity to comment.", "Date": "January 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Mayday", "Author": "murray johnson", "ReviewID": "R1RS3YKKPJ40QA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just wanted to give a little praise to the Mayday people.

I just needed something with good processing power, an HD display, and something simple so that my mother could browse the web and watch Netflix or something. The product came with the standard usb/wall charger and nothing more, but you don't need anything else. After registering the device it was good to go. The quality is superb, transitioning between apps and things are easy and fluid, and it even has a headphone jack so you can hear media in peace or without disturbing others. The only thing my mother wanted, though, was to play Papa Pear Saga and it isn't compatible with the Kindle Fire.All in all this product was more than enough for my mother. She was happy with the product and I was happy to see my mother happy. The only thing I didn't like, which has nothing to do with the product itself, was that Amazon had the May-Day $30 off Kindle's sale right after I ordered it so I kinda missed out on a greater deal. I'd recommend this to anyone who just plans to browse the web, check Facebook, watch YouTube or Netflix, or something like Skype.", "Date": "January 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Soo disappointed", "Author": "Kristin Gilpatrick", "ReviewID": "RK96E3OGZXP39", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My only love about it is the camera.

It will be brief.  I LOVE MY KINDLE FIRE HDX \"7\"This is the journey I took before I settled on my HDX \"7\".Purchased Barnes And Noble HD 9.0. Returned it. Purchased Google Nexus 7 Second Generation. Returned it  Purchased Samsung Note 8 for an amazing $225 from Staples because of coupons and store discounts. No rebates to wait for. It was an incredible deal. Returned it. Purchased apple mini with retina display for $399. Returned it. Purchased Kiindle Fire HDX 8.9. returned it.The HDX \"7\" and HDX \"8.9\" are both amazing. I settled on the \"7\" because I bought it from BEST BUY for $239. The HDX \"8.9\" was $429 for the 32 gig unit. Four things. The Display color is awesome! The display screen resolution is incredibly sharp and the \"READING VIEW\" is a true joy when I'm reading digital media such as CNN and MSN. ( Reading View feature is only available on certain websites so  it's not on all the websites I browse but it's a fantastic feature to have!!) The audio is wonderful. I also am very impressed with the \"MAYDAY\" feature which connects you with a live technical advisor in 15 seconds by simply clicking on \"MAYDAY\". I can think of a few times when I wasn't and home received help instantly. The \"MAYDAY\" Tech. drew red circles on my screen so I could see what he was doing and fixed my problem remotely.

The very first book I rented, \"Core Concepts in Cultural Anthropology 5th addition\" from Kindle, I was unable to download the textbook to my computer. After dealing with Kindle tech-support for a very long time. All he could do was apologize and tell me the book is not compatible with my computer. The main reason, as I stated above, and the only reason I bought the Kindle fire 7 inch HDX was to be able to have my college texts on the go with me and on my computer at home. I asked all these questions through Amazon and Kindle sales and tech personnel through online chats before deciding on the purchase. As I stated the main reason for the purchase was to have the ability to rent or purchase each texts, but as I learn more about the Kindle. I decided the extra bells and whistles would be nice to have also. Another disappointment you give us a camera with absolutely no way to take good pictures because you can't see what you're taking a picture of. I still have time to return this product and plan on doing so, but I'll have to take a loss on the case and screen protector that I purchased in anticipation of my Kindle's arrival. I have lost count of how many people came up to me on campus, who see me with my Kindle and asked my opinion. And I'm sorry to say I have told all of them to search for another product and not waste their money or time discussing this product sales or tech-support who knowingly lie in order to sell more product.

Content is added frequently, which is a huge concern for me.  One of our biggest struggles was that my daughter constantly wants me to download her new games, often minutes after downloading something.

Reading is not difficult at all and we have both read an e-book now, one from Amazon Prime and one from the local library. Even websites that are not \"responsive\" look fine in the landscape view. Sometimes it is a little difficult to tap a link on websites, but I imagine that is true on all tablets. We read news in bed with coffee, and I use it with its new stand in the kitchen to read recipes off the web while I cook. We have even watched a movie from Amazon Prime on it.And that's one of the neatest things about it. We are on satellite, and even though our internet is fast enough to stream video, we have a usage allotment every month we can't go over. But we have a free period between 12 midnight and 5 am. With Amazon Prime, you can download movies to watch later. I believe that feature is only on the Fire HDX. But it looks like it is only true on movies. TV shows seem to be streaming only.I found the interface very intuitive and was working it right away. My husband was a little slower and bought a book for it. But then I picked up a few things I didn't know too.

I think we have to put all these tablets in perspective. I also have a 8.9\" Nook HD+. So, much as been said about the Kindle that I had to buy one to see for myself is it all that it is said to be. I like the Kindle because of its size and portability. One of the main reasons that I can really enjoy my Kindle is because it has been rooted. This means that not only do I have access to Amazon content, I also have access to the Google PlayStore. This is important to me in order to be able to enjoy ownership of a Kindle.With it being rooted I can enjoy both worlds. The Kindle is a fantastic tablet, but in my opinion only if it is rooted. I don't like proprietary software and if you keep it with Amazon's offers, ecosystem it gets really boring quick. I am a Prime and Netflix member, so this tablet is great. I am able to fit it inside my purse and travel with it with no problem. However, the only reason I can enjoy it to this point is because it is rooted. It is a beautiful tablet and I really like everything it can do.Pros: affordability, portability, fast and efficient software (speedy), beautiful display resolution, versatile (if able to root), impressive device (makes me want the 8.9\" just can't justify the purchase since I have a Nook of the same size)Cons: no way to expand memory, no HDMI ouptput, proprietary software, having to pay to stop special offers", "Date": "January 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "I LOVE it!!", "Author": "Barbie", "ReviewID": "R13C13DT45WADG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Beautiful display, lightweight, no problems with using it immediately.

This is not my first kindle (or second, or...). This tablet is definitely an improvement over the previous versions, it's more responsive, it handles video and web browsing so much better than the previous Fire generation, and I love the slimmed down version.The overall design is an improvement. The video quality is great, and music does play with a decent quality. Love the feature where it can display lyrics while playing song (if the mp3 has the information), thanks to the whole X-Ray/Lyrics feature. There's a lot of new touches here that are fun. I really appreciate the volume and the power buttons being on the opposite sides of the kindle now (don't know how many times I've hit the wrong one on my Fire >.<).Also, being able to have more than two browsers open on Silk now w/out it crashing all of the time is a great improvement.Some minor quirks - not sure if it's me or the tablet, but still trying to figure out how to get pictures already taken from my phone onto the tablet and directly into the photo folder.Have installed several apps without a problem, downloaded files and opened them, so far so good. The kindle goes everywhere with me (literally, it's the perfect size to fit in my purse). I wish there were more cover options for the 7\", but it seems to be increasing the longer the kindle is out, and I think a cover/case is a must for one of these. This is the kindle that I do take everywhere, and on a recent trip, I used this more than my Surface as it has my most frequently used personal emails installed on it (easy to set up), I can access my social accounts, my music, and of course my books.The battery is... eh, decent. I can keep it on and play music for a few hours, video less, and use it to read books for most of a day.

Grinstead", "ReviewID": "RP5JLI47IGQSP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had owned an iPad previously. And, generally, the concept of a tablet is really convenient and fun. I loved my iPad.But iPads are expensive: The Apps are expensive; the cloud for storage is expensive; iBooks is expensive; updating to a new model is expensive.And the Kindle Fire HDX proves that the iPads aren't worth it. The Kindle Fire HDX does everything I wanted my iPad to do. Further, it's Amazon; so even though technically all of the apps purchased are Android apps, Amazon prices many of these Android apps more advantageously to me than my Google Play store and other Android shops do.The graphic layout of the Kindle Fire HDX 7\", i.e. its icon placement, \"the carousel,\" its menu placement is very intuitive and pleasing to the eye. It's a very minor thing, but I actually really enjoy \"the carousel\": You purchase a new book or app and it shows up as this huge icon among other often-used icons. It's fun and makes you feel like you have purchased an actual book.The Kindle Fire HDX 7\" feels amazing to hold, too. I am a bibliophile and, hence, own too many books. Nothing will ever compare to holding an actual book for me. However, Amazon has managed to design this particular Kindle at least feel as much like a book as possible.This is great news because another thing that Amazon generally does exceedingly better than its competition is sell eBooks. As a former owner of an iPad, I was able to and did download Kindle, NOOK, iBooks, Kobe, and other eBook-purchasing and reading apps. While owning those iPads still I always defaulted to the Kindle Reader. Amazon consistently and for a long time has simply offered better and more popular eBooks at better prices. Amazon's \"Daily Deals\" are something to watch for. I have owned my Kindle Fire for less than a month and have already been able to populate it inexpensively with bestsellers like the Divergent series, the Legend series, Burial Rites, the Goldfinch, Doctor Sleep, academic books on behavioral economics, etc. But, going back to the original point, the fact that the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" feels so much like a book had made purchasing such a large quantity of eBooks as I currently have even more enticing at the time of purchase. As confusing as that sentence was.But, in deciding between purchasing this Kindle and one of its competitors (namely an iPad), here is likely the most important point: My five-star review is as much about Amazon itself as the Kindle.It is true that the Kindle Fire literally does everything that I have known my iPads to do. Like an Android phone, the big difference is in who supplies the apps. I, personally, love Android apps more so than iTunes apps. So considering nothing else, the Kindle Fire HDX was a worthwhile purchase if only because I was able to update my tablet without my credit card company deciding it needed to raise my interest rate because I had paid the equivalent of a new furniture set from Bombay for a tablet that had a logo whose bumper sticker would look great on my Subaru.So, whether or not you get full enjoyment from the Kindle Fire HDX depends on how much you use Amazon. Full Disclosure: I am an Amazon Prime member. I love it: Free 2-Day Shipping, streaming video, cloud storage, one free soon-to-be released book a month, etc. And, as a Prime member, my Kindle fully enhances that experience.", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great fun", "Author": "nikki horner", "ReviewID": "RK06N7FNAL6HJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Does almost everything.

He gave me the option of a Kindle or an iPad so I choose Kindle because I wanted something different; we have a few Apple products already. Unfortunately when I received the Kindle, there was an issue with the volume buttons on the back. They only worked half of the time. When they did work they were kind of glitchy and the times that they did not work, well, you would push the buttons numerous times and absolutely nothing would happen. So Amazon kindly sent me a replacement. Once again, this Kindle had a problem as well (maybe I have horrible luck?). This time the area that should have displayed AT&T; 4G and the signal bars read \"INVALID SIM\". It would not work. So I went to AT&T; and got a new sim card and it still did not work. I returned both Kindles and decided to not receive a third.Things I did like about the Kindle: I liked the size. I didn't really want a big tablet so the size of the 7 inch was perfect. I liked the back side of the Kindle. The iPad's back are metal so I see them as being more likely to slip out of your hands but the kindle's back made for a better grip. I like the display. Also, the speakers on the back of the kindle were great! It has a nice surround sound like quality.Things I did not like: the hardware issues.Overall, the Kindle itself was nice but problems with the hardware were not okay.

As they have not drawn nearly as many developers to their store as Apple or Google.  With that said, so far it has not been an issue.  Our daughter has been able to find most all the apps she was looking for.  I think as the Kindle continues to gain traction, the developers will obviously go where the customers are.  I'm highly impressed with the device itself.  Some of the motions aren't as smooth as my Ipad, but not terribly noticeable.  It has a  very nice picture resolution.  Much better than my Ipad 2.  The hardware is top notch and at this price, hard to turn away from.  I would definitely recommend this as a purchase for younger people.

In the morning, I unplug it and just use the speakers during the day. However, the speakers occasionally wouldn't work. I discovered the problem - a faulty jack. To make the speakers work again, I would have to plug in and unplug the headset again.I called Amazon CS, and they sent me a new one.

Since that was the only problem, I was very happy about it.)The new one has the exact same problem.Because of all the horror return stories and because it's a minor issue, I'm just going to keep it.

I've owned an iphone and built a Hackintosh out of an old laptop, but jumped to Android a few years back in order to learn and explore.  Am thinking about getting a Macbook Air for writing.  I use a Lenovo Windows 8 tablet/combo Helix at work.  My wife uses my old Samsung Galaxy Tab 8.9\" (original from AT&T;) and my phone is Galaxy S4.  Recently I sold an Asus Transformer TF701 Android combo (very nice) to save up for the Macbook Air.  In other words I try to appreciate the best of every platform and approach.  What I've really wanted was that ONE DEVICE that would do everything - play my content (movies, books, audio) AND let me write with a keyboard on my lap while on the go.So given this profile and my ultimate goal, why the Kindle Fire HDX?Somewhat begrudgingly I've concluded that my goal is unrealistic.  For writing I need an ultrabook.  And one that has a big enough keyboard for me to want to use it.  And something that runs MS Office.  Unfortunately for me that rules out Android.  Yes I know there are Office-compatible apps and I've tried them.  They save to the cloud but it remains a limited experience.  Combo units are tempting but the larger they are (10in and above) the less useful they are as tablets.So I decided to give the Kindle Fire HDX a try to take advantage of my Prime account and have something larger than my Galaxy S4 for reading and watching on the couch or in bed.Other reviews will give you the blow-by-blow on all the features.  I'd like to focus on a few points:-Angled Edge: people have knocked this as clunky.  I don't get it.  The angle helps with space for the speaker vents.-Button-placement: reviewers have criticized placement of the sleep and volume rocker buttons.  Again, I don't see the big deal here.  Every tablet can potential get upside down.  It's not a big deal.-Kindle OS:  The design is very simple and buttery, I mean buttery smooth.  Yeah, it's not stock Android and I thought this might be a concern but after some intense use over the last few days I really like it.  It's simple.  You get where you need to very quickly.  You don't get lost.  You're not bogged down wondering if you've tweaked your widgets for optimal use.  Android is fun because it's so customizable but this is a device that sells you on how elegant the interface is.  I'm sold.-Mayday:  I thought this was a gimmick but I ran into an issue with my old Audible.com account and used Mayday for help.  The rep was very good.  The experience made me truly think:  this will start showing up everywhere.  The idea that they can see what you're doing is not something I'm worried about; it's a great way to get help.  Anyone who's done their own troubleshooting knows how frustrating it is to walk step by step painfully through screens just to get to the basic first step.  I saw the vision--reducing the time to fix problems.  This is big.-Prime Lending Library: I've got to admit when I finally realized what this is I was a little disappointed.  I hadn't researched in advance that you don't get access to every book; just certain ones.  They've salted it with a few best sellers like Hunger Games but I was hoping for access to more obscure areas of the catalog.  Still, a free book a month will get me reading more.-Speakers: reviews I read didn't emphasize how good the audio is.  I think it's outstanding.  The grills leave space when the tablet lays flat.  You can play it loud even when on your lap.  I'm really, really pleased with this aspect.-\"Side-loading\" apps: I'm still looking at this but one of the first things I did after purchase was download the XBMC apk and install it.  It works great.  Now I have access to my home media servers including my HDHomerun TV tuners.  This makes the tablet an incredible media player.Conclusion:  This is an elegant system, period.  To me it stands alone in terms of its integration of the hardware and Amazon feature set.  If you want the Apple ecosystem, that's fine.  Get an iPad.  If you want Google, same story.  If you want a very streamlined and excellent implementation that maximizes your Amazon investment (along with some additional possibility to get non-Amazon apps), then you won't be disappointed.  In fact you'll really, really enjoy this.", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "Gerald Woodard", "ReviewID": "R2XUFR12ZDDJO9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love this product and easy to use,  takes a little time getting use to it, I would recommend to others.

Just a black screen, like the device has been switched off, and it will not respond from pressing or holding the power button. All 4 times I got frustrated at the lack of response and walked away from it for a few hours. When I came back it worked just fine like there had never been a problem. Was not a charging issue, the battery had plenty of life left and I did not have it on charge while I let it be for a few hours.Amazon and the Google play store do not get along.  The kindle is designed to actively block any attempt to access the play store. It can be worked around of course, but it is annoying that I must do that. The Amazon app collection is not very large in comparison and leaves a lot to be desired to me.Overall it's great, I use it all the time. I want to give it 5 stars but for the two reasons listed above I have to deduct one star.", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Clearly Audible", "Author": "A2D1", "ReviewID": "R23TBRA069BMHQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A big challenge for other tablets in the market.Meets 95% of daily users needs.Great item to own for the price.", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love It", "Author": "Kenny Schoborg", "ReviewID": "R1SFC9ZH7FEQD4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got into reading about a year go and decided to invest in a Kindle after talking with several friends.

I tried with all my power to like the Kindle. But in the end, I will be returning this device. The hardware is excellent, and the user interface is pretty good as well. But odd behavior kept occurring. The device once went into a boot loop while I was at work without a charger. It continuously rebooted all day long. Nothing I did would stop the boot loop. Finally when I got home and plugged it into the charger, it booted back to the UI. I also have been noticing the screen flicker at times. It's more of an annoyance than a problem. There are other odd things that I can't recall at the moment. But ultimately, it's the battery life that prompts me to return the Kindle. Fully charged at 100% and left over night will find the device down to 88% without use. Then, when I pick the device up and actually use it, the battery is down to needing another charge within 1 or 2 (maybe 3) hours. Not heavy usage either, playing Candy Crush then browsing Facebook will do it. One time, I plugged the Kindle into charge before leaving for work, only to come home eight hours later and find that the screen was still on, and the device hadn't gone up 1% in battery charge. Another time, I plugged the device in for the night at 68%, went to bed and woke up to find the device charged only to 77%. Meanwhile, my Nexus 7 was at 14%, plugged in at the same time and was at 100% the next morning. I just can't have a device that I am constantly worried about keeping charged all the time.

Which really impressed me! They pushed out some updates to me, gave me pointers on how to ensure I am on the tablet version of common websites (since videos won't work on all of the regular sites), and ABC published an updated app for viewing episodes. Now I am largely happy with the Kindle's ability to watch streaming videos. The only downsides I have experienced is the Hulu is not available (you can access hulu plus but not the free site), the volume/sound projection abilities don't seem as good as some of my other devices (like my ipod), and you can only have one window/tab open at a time.

So, I'll share my experience with that part in case it could be useful for someone else looking for that functioanlity.I had this for few weeks, and basically can echo many other reviewers. Excellent build quality, display, Amazon apps. If you're planning to use this device just to shop, read, watch videos on Amazon (on Kindle display) I doubt you could find anything else even close. However, if you want to output the display or sound content to an external device like a TV it all starts to go downhill. I want to highlight these issues since I could not find any details on the web (except very few).For some reason, Amazon does not provide apps such as \"Pioneer Control App\" and \"Panasonic Remote 2\". These are essential for me to control my TV and receiver from Kindle, so I could use them as a workaround for at least playing my own music/video library. To make matters worse, there's no other display output (like DLNA, through the home network). Kindle does not have an HDMI port, and the USB port does not work as a \"Slim Port\". So, I tried the \"Kindle Certified\" NetgearPush2TV. A real dissapointing experience. I wrote a separate review for that. Apparently Amazon tech support (and Netgear support) does not know much about this (I spoke with at least 4 agenrts, if I remember correctly). All Amazon agents were great, but couldn't help. So, if you plan to use the Kindle for the following then you'll be dissapointed:1. Play music from Kindle to your networked (aka connected) receiver2. Play videos (from internet/Amazon Instant Videos and from your own library) from Kindle to a networked TV3. GPS (e.g. with CoPilot) --- Kindle does not have a GPS, which I realized after buying. My bad, not whining hereA modern high-end device like Kindle should provide this sort of basic functionality, in my opinion. I was surprised to learn these limitations (the hard way). There are apps for this sort of thing (e.g. Flips/iMediaShare) but they're far from perfection with many limitations. I tried very hard to keep the Kindle and find workarounds for the limitations mentioned above but I could not. So I had to return it.Since then I bought a Nexus 7. Only problem I have is that Amazon does not allow it to access Instant videos (I knew this before I bought it but still weird, because I can use any other device and don't see how Amazon makes money by blocking it. Kindle is really cheap, so, also hard to understand how they make lot of money by selling the hardware. So, I'm confused but there must be some reason other than just Amazon/Google rivarly). I don't watch videos very often (but my son takes care of that for me with his Kindle) so it's not a huge isue for me at this point.Again, you need to read this review very carefully since I did not attempt to highlight lot of good aspects of the device since others have already mentioned those; if the extra networking/navigation/output functionality is not needed for you then the Kindle is an excellent device.", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Lovely little tablet.

They're not intrusive with whatever I might be doing on the tablet and if it bothered me that much I would just pay the $15 to have them removed. There are some deals that are exclusive to kindle fire owners which is pretty awesome and since I use amazon quite often for purchases, I don't mind a chance at snagging a good deal. There are plenty of apps to pick from (for my purposes anyway) like Facebook, Youtube, and a few games here or there.

But, in case you need assistance, it's built right into the device as an online \"visual\" chat function. Getting Amazon Prime was an added bonus as I've made a few subsequent related accessories purchases that gave me free shipping. This device is \"special\" and very easy to use. It's very fast in all its operations and adding security to this device for your network is a snap. Those of you who are fortunate enough to own this device know what I mean. Buy one! You won't be sorry. Mine is connected to my home wireless network so I don't have to worry about data charges or a cell phone plan. Surfing is a breeze and, personally, I like this device over other similar tablet devices from other manufacturers.", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "great", "Author": "deborah brestel", "ReviewID": "RB73OKW22ITZ5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "great change from original kindle have upgraded each year.battery life much better.will wait till next to see what is new.", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "aww some", "Author": "don shaw", "ReviewID": "R1Q9SIS3Y1R2M0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't remember purchasing this one but I would have had to anyway because I wouldn't have got to play on this one at all.", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Pleased with purchase", "Author": "Brad Batt", "ReviewID": "R22KYIMJJLJJH3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Awesome product, very pleased with my purchase.

I haven't owned a tablet before but I've played around on other's iPads. I feel like this tablet is very comparable to an iPad but at almost half the cost, I would pick the Kindle every time. I chose the 7\" instead of the 8.9\" because I like the smaller tablet and I personally would never hold up something so big to take a picture, especially when I have my phone or digital camera.Cons:- There is a blue/purple haze around the border of the screen that is visible on white. It actually doesn't bother me at all but it does bother some people. I don't even notice it's there unless I specifically pay attention to it. Even though it doesn't bother me, I would rather it not be there.- Battery life isn't great compared to the iPad. For the same amount of use, I'm used to charging every 2 weeks or so instead of every 3-4 days.- I don't like that the charger is plugged in at an angle instead of straight on. It's not really THAT big of an issue but it does take more effort than usual to plug it in.- This is more my fault for not reading/understanding the Prime benefits, but you only get the benefits of Prime if your account pays for it, not when you get added and another account pays for it (which completely makes sense). I was really looking forward to \"borrowing\" Kindle books for free and downloading movies to watch later offline but my husband wanted to keep paying for prime on his account and I didn't want to put my Kindle under his account or have both of us pay for Prime.Overall, I love my Kindle and it's a great tablet for the price.

Without any changes from the factory set up, we had to charge the tablet once every two days with about 45 minutes use each time.  Unacceptable.There is a lack of educational software compared to Android and Ipad.The software for kids is okay.  There is quite a limit on what they can do unless you subscribe to the special kids software for $2.99 a month.Like most tablets, there is edge bleeding from the backlight.Other tablets offer desirable features like GPS, SD card, a rear facing camera and better software for a better price.Amazon does not carry cheaper cases like ebay does.SummaryAs an educational device with occasional video viewing, the Kindle HDX has fallen short of our expectations.  The OS is limited and the kid time application sacrifices a lot of capability without buying an add-on program.  If it were a tablet for me, it would be fine if I could find something to extend battery life.  I can see most people enjoying this tablet.

The first problem was that even though I marked it as a \"gift\" it was registered in my name. Her generation (mostly) is not tech savvy and we bought this model due to the mayday button. She lives 1000+ miles away so I could not help her with set up and it took her almost 3 weeks to get it set up, so she could use it. ( this was due to the fact that it was registered to me.) She was on the phone for several hours( at least 3+ hours and 3 separate calls ) with tech support before they figured this out. I understand that the registration process is intuitive for most generations BUT a simple fact sheet with a tech support phone number would have been very helpful. She had to hunt down the number, for herself. She was nervous when she didn't find anything other then the kindle, in the box. I concede that this might have prolonged the delay in getting it set up.

As a 5th year student I really didn't want to (nor could I afford) a new laptop that will be replaced by a professional computer in a year or so. So, I thought on black Friday why not try for $180. I own the 2012 kindle fire and thought it was this seemed to be a good choice. I got a Bluetooth keyboard for this to make it a \"real laptop\", because I mainly write essays and it does well. I like this new kindle so far. I can type with a Bluetooth keyboard on word apps which helps a lot for the normal college student. I am not a tech geek or anything, just needed something to get me by for the last school year. I had a normal 15\" laptop then a netbook that both died out in college so I really didn't want another expensive computer and this is a good replacement. I don't plan on this being a forever replacement and I don't think other people should either. I use it to type and play games on it. The kindle is really thin which I love. At first I was hesitant because I was fine with the 2012 fire but I needed something better to write essays on. Now I think this is new one is fine. Overall, if your looking for a basic tablet that can do things like write in polaris app (or in king soft, whatever) and play app games this does very well. If your looking for a tablet that is more photo sharing, personal details, bigger screen, etc this may not be for you. I haven't had a problem with it and advise a person to get Prime with it, you can download movies and watch them without internet (great feature).Down sides:Yes it's a kindle, you can't have a screen photo and they're adds but for the normal person thats not much a bothersome.The power button and a volume button are on the back of it. I find it a hard transition coming from old fire to the new one. It beats me why they'd put them on the back. I find the power button on back a little bit of an annoyance but new fire users may not. This also makes it an issue because if you have an old kindle fire you'll need to buy a whole new case and NO OTHER KINDLE FIRE CASES WILL FIT IT! (You have to specifically buy an HDX one). I bought one thinking they would but nope. Normal CASES cover the power button on back; I still use the non-fitting case because I don't want to spend more money on a case.It is only 7\", no surprise there. But it is on the tiny side for tablets. I didn't mind in on the 2012 kindle fire and I don't now. If you have a giant cell phone it may seem odd because they're close in size but I don't have a high tech phone so this really doesn't bother me.This version does have a front facing camera, I don't know how many MP. I can't seem to find that info (but I haven't searched that hard).

Clifton \"Techie Tony\"", "ReviewID": "R3RK1YPEQMC4EU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What's not to like? This is probably the best piece of hardware out there for the price hands down. I have 2 iPads, iPhones, iMac. I love the Mac environment and iOS.  The hardware is obviously quite expensive, but if you use the device even 1-2 hours a day I would pay the extra and get the iPad. If you don't use the device regularly or if you're an Amazon-o-phile and your whole world revolves around Amazon, the Fire is the only logical alternative IMHO.  I prefer my iPad in almost every way, but I like the small size of the 7\" to carry to town, mall, church or whatever instead of hauling around the iPad. It's an amazing price, and that's the best feature about this device.  I love the nice PPI resolution, which makes me feel right at home while reading.  The speakers are the next biggest stand-out feature that I really love about the HDX.  The first time I sat down to watch a movie on it, the sound literally blew me away!  It made the movie twice as interesting to hear the amazing surround sound or perhaps even 3-D sound if that's possible, awesome bass, great range, nice to hear it coming from both sides of the device when in landscape mode, all things I would expect from the more expensive iPad, but dont find! Also plenty of power if it's anywhere near close enough to see the screen.  I just have to gripe about the Amazon tweaks and control of the Android OS that just doesn't feel as customizable or as intuitive as plain old Android OS or obviously iOS.  Again for my purposes of mostly reading books, and the occasional movie, or browsing, this environment is actually just fine, but not my first choice, perhaps after using it long enough I'll learn to actually appreciate it, we'll see.  I wish it could be thinner and lighter of course, but I'd rather have the longer battery life that it does have vs. being lighter weight, with technology where its at right now.  I'm thankful for the wake sleep feature with the right case. I love that it has BT where a lot of cheap tablets in this price range tend to leave it out.  So far I've found all the Apps in the Amazon App Store that are important to me, so the App limitations haven't really bothered me yet. They seem to have a really good selection.  I do like not having to worry about bugs or viruses by only using Apps that are patrolled by Amazon, kind of like Apple does. It gives me a nice feeling of security.  Over-all, I can hardily recommend the HDX to anyone that doesn't use iTunes, or have an iPhone or Mac.  And to those looking to just get their feet wet in the tablet experience using it only occasionally. If you plan to really be using it a lot, I would instead highly recommend paying the extra money to get an iPad mini or Air, it's well worth the extra investment.  However this is a great starter tablet for kids or to just dabble yourself a little bit to see if tablets are really all they are cracked up to be!  I didn't get on the tablet bandwagon for almost 2 years, thinking they were just a passing fad, and were terribly limited compared to netbooks... well, after I saw they weren't going away after all, I got one, and I have never regretted it since!

Soo...instead of microtransactions inside of an app to get rid of ads, you have to pay $50 more to not have these on your lock screen.  Not cool Amazon...not cool.EDIT: I purchased this on a Black Friday sale, to clarify, it is no longer $50 difference in the devices for the ad/non-ad ones, but at the time, one was on a large sale and the other wasn't...making it a large price difference.Second complaint which is also the awesomeness of this product.  With the purchase of the Kindle Fire, Kindle Fire HD, and the Kindle Fire HDX, you get free 500 coins for the app store after registering it and adding billing information.  I completed this...and 0 coins.  Soo....being curious, I used the \"Mayday\" button on there to contact support.

The browser is much faster and I'm happy with the set up of buttons and such. The mayday button is nice too for when you really can't figure something out. Overall I'm looking forward to this becoming my new favorite device.

I am coming from the original kindle fire and it was well worth the upgrade.  The screen is amazing, very sharp, definitely as good if not better than the retina dispalay.  The sound is also very good.  The new interface is great.  It is really fast and fluid.  My only complaints are the location of the volume and power buttons, as well as the camera.  They are positioned in A way vest suited for holding the device landscape, while I would personally prefer them to be positioned in more of a portrait manner.  Another plus to the device is the Appstore has grown a lot since the first kindle fire.  It has most of the games that iOS has.  The only thing it lacks is a a program like word, excell, and PowerPoint.  Over all I would definitely recommend this device to anyone who likes an amazing display, a very decent battery life, great sound, a good Appstore, and a light sleek device.", "Date": "December 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Happy", "Author": "Linda", "ReviewID": "R1DO27A2RC6UYB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My laptop died, with no hope of repair, the day after I ordered this Kindle.

As soon as I logged in with my account all my kindle content synced up! I got the free trial so I had picked the kindle with the ads and I did not feel like the ads were bothersome at all. They mostly showed up when the tablet was in a 'sleep' status so I saw them when I was turning it back on. I even clicked on some out of curiosity since they are items I would be interested in. I did not add any extra apps so I just used what was already installed. It was a bit of a learning curve since I have been using an iPad but I was able to figure it out without much trouble. The browser is user friendly and the menus are not hard to use (once you figure out where the controls are). I mostly used it to watch movies and shows from amazon since I have Prime. I loved being able to take it around the house and not have a sore wrist! It is very light and the screen felt pretty hardy so i didn't worry about scratching the screen or the possibility of it dropping. The screen was crystal clear so I thoroughly enjoyed watching movies and shows on it ( the imdb inserts during shows and movies were a plus for me). I thought its size would be a disadvantage but it felt just like a regular size tablet. I liked that I could easily carry it in my handbag without feeling the extra weight or bulk! Battery life was decent. I was able to use it continuosly for at least 3 hours before it got critically low, although I noticed that even plugged to the wall it would somehow still be on and wouldn't be 100% charged? (could have been tks I wasn't physically turning it off during charge time) I assumed that maybe it was because ads popped up during this time. I had a hard time returning it but I wasn't quite ready to part with that amount of money right then. I still want to get one for sure!!!! So basically to sum it up, this tablet is a small, delightfully light, hardy, crystal clear, fast (in my opinion), and handy tablet. If you use Amazon a lot, it is a great tablet to have! I buy and rent e-books from Amazon, and have purchased most of my music from here too so, it was great to access all my content from it! I didn't think I would want one but after test driving it for a month now I really really do want to get one!

So ..it has a fast enough processor to game and complete tasks like surf or watch a movie. Oh yeah another big thing was....reading books...this thing makes it easy to read a book....Amazon Prime and this device just works and is a huge solution for many tasks just reach down and pick it up...only thing that I would like to see is Kindles offer more harddrive space....like a 1tb...yeah we are in a time of file servers aka cloud servers...but in times of no internet...a real harddrive is a must...face it 4G/3G is a hoax, its a joke when it comes to internet so don't fall for the 4G lie and highway robbery mobile internet companies charge for internet...Amazon seriously this product and your growing services is on the right track for the future.

I watched movies, streamed music, watched video, surfed, read articles and books, used the alarm and calender, used yahoo weather app, played games. The only thing i noticed as something it lacked was harddrive space when the Amazon prime video offered to download the movie better quality would require more harddrive space. But this is more of need when traveling through an area where there would be no internet or limited internet. And...

Since this tablet cannot yet be purchased in The Netherlands in a store, this was the only chance for me to pick it up and feel and explore it. I loved the design, the feel, the incredible clarity and mega-fast processor.Back home, I tested a lot of tablets at a Dutch local megastore. Google Nexus seemed appealing, then Samsung tab 3.0, but I disliked the shapes, too long/narrow screen proportions. LG Gpad 8.3 was another temptation, but again: that weird long narrow screen? I jumped on to Apple's Ipad Mini 2. Bigger screen than the average 7\" and just perfectly proportioned. Simply not being an Apple's type of guy, I hesitated. What held me back at Ipad Mini 2, were the limitations of dropping audio and video files on it. You would have to use Itunes for almost everything and convert many movie files.With Kindle, I wasn't sure about its Amazon-tunnel-vision strategy. But I also read there were a lot of ways to sideload apps outside the Amazon app-convent.From the day I received it (3 days after purchase, this gets UPS delivered to your doorstep and yes, they do ask your neighbours to receive it on your behalf in case you're not at home), I have not regretted this purchase for one second.I like Amazon products a lot. I do read Kindle books. But I like Kobo also. No problem, on youtube there's a perfectly clear instruction video on how to bring Kobo to your Kindle, and the two do peacefully co-exist.Magazines: lovely, cheap and easy to order, a delight to page through on this tablet.PDF files, Word documents: perfect viewing.For more extensive typing, I purchased the Perixx Periboard-805L, which works like a charm as a bluetooth wireless foldable keyboard for my Kindle tablet.Kindle Fire HDX 7 had my first attention, and remained my ultimate choice.

Also have a full-size iPad which is a great size for watching movies in bed, but really too big/heavy to play games.  The original Kindle Fire has only 8 GB storage (partly taken up by software) so I wanted another smaller tablet.  It was between the new Kindle HDX or the new iPad mini.  One thing I didn't like about the iPad mini (besides the price tag) is that the bezzle on the long sides is so narrow, it is hard to hold the device without getting your thumb on the display (which screws up games).  When I saw the HDX on sale on Cyber Monday, I grabbed it.It's fast, thin, light and easy to hold for long periods of time.  I can't believe how light it is compared to my KFire! There are several design changes, such as the ability to show the percentage the battery is charged in the little icon in the top right corner. You have to swipe down from the top of the display to access settings and other utilities.  I got the 32 GB version, so there is plenty of room for games and other apps.  I did download a Prime Instant Video to watch off-line, but I don't like the small display for watching movies.About that display -- I compared the HDX to the original Fire, looking at the same page of a book that has alot of white space on it.  White is a color, and like all colors, it can be \"warm\" or \"cool.\"  A cool white is \"bluish\", and a warm white will be a little yellowish.  When I compared the 2 kindle displays for a book, I was shocked to see something I never noticed before.  On the original Fire, the white is \"cool/bluish\" and there is yellowish tint seeping in around the edges of the pages of the book I was comparing!  This never bothered  me; as I said, I never noticed it.  On the new HDX, the opposite is true --  the color white is warm (yellowish) with the blue/purple (that so many have commented about) seeping in around the edges of the book.  I doubt that this will bother me, and I feel that the people who complained about this and sent back this beautiful little device because of it, need to get a life!  BTW, the page on the HDX doesn't look yellowish to me at all; it is only when compared side-by-side to the original Fire that you can detect the different tints to the white color.I love playing games on the HDX, as even fast running games (such as my favorite Temple Run 2) work without stalling.  And, I got Temple Run Oz (finally) which was not compatible with the original Fire.There are some design features I don't like, such as the way the charger sticks in at an angle.  But charging is very fast using the included charger. My only real issue now is the battery life.  I am currently charging it up, and I am going to see if I can get anything close to 10 hours of \"mixed use\" on it.  (Yes, there are ways to extend battery life, such as turning off wifi when not using it.  Search on the internet for other tips.)Edit about battery life:  I usually find that when products are advertised as \"up to X hours on a single battery charge (depending on settings, usage, blah blah blah)\"  I usually get half that. What concerned me about the HDX was that I had fallen asleep with the HDX unplugged, watching a PREVIOUSLY DOWNLOADED movie (a 2.5 hour movie downloaded in \"better\" quality; after it finished, the display went into sleep mode)-- the next morning, the battery was showing only 35% charged from fully charged the night before.  Since many people posting on the forums with battery problems were told to do a \"hard reboot\"  I tried that then fully charged the battery again (luckily, charging is pretty quick.)  Downloading music, and letting the display go to sleep mode, the HDX lost only about 10% per hour.  But as soon as I picked it up and played some games for a little while (like Temple Run 2) the battery much more rapidly depleted (this is with wifi turned on, as music was simultaneously downloading).  Then I recharged it, and again tested that same 2.5 hour previously downloaded movie -- with wifi turned off, \"airplane mode\" turned on, and brightness set at about 70%, the battery drained from fully charged to 65%. So, finally, I downloaded a 2 hour SD quality movie to my HDX, and going from fully charged, with wifi off, and brightness lowered to about 50%, the battery went to 88%, losing only 12%.  Yes, a big improvement over my original KFire which lost double that, 25%, under the same conditions.When I got my HDX it was about 70% charged.  Looking in the settings, I saw that the software was up-to-date.  I was able to download content, read, and play games, without the HDX turning itself off and rebooting (as many have complained of).  The next morning, I saw a notification that there had been a software update -- one thing that was changed is that you can now put apps and books into \"collections.\"  Not only that, but apparently my HDX \"synced\" wirelessly with my iPad Kindle reading app, where I had already put some books into collections.  Those same books now appear in collections on my HDX without my doing anything. Thank you Amazon.I give this 5 stars, certainly in comparison to the original Kindle Fire.  In general, this HDX is spectacular and the price is great.", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "bargain despite the blue", "Author": "Marcus L.

If you must read with a white background (sepia or black is easier on the eyes in any case) then this might not be the machine for you.  But for everyone else--where you gonna go?  Every single tablet has some issue--the nexus 7 has little power, the big ipad is overpriced, the little one is both overpriced and under-powered, the big hdx is much less capable as it has the same power components but needs to display all that extra space.If you can deal with the 'blue thing' and get around the 'mojito' by well circulated means--this thing is a wonderful bargain.

Brownie point #1SIZE: It is significantly lighter than my original fire,  and the tapered edges make it feel quite thin.  Not a fan of the tapered edges at this point,  seems slippery like I am going to drop it.  Might just be the way I hold it ..CHARGER:  I am not a fan of the charger port location;  due to the tapered edges ... the mini-USB plug goes in on a weird angle.  Can't just hold the thing flat and push it in ... I can see I will need to be very careful when plugging it in.SCREEN:  Turning on the HDX ... had a instant WOW factor.  The screen is so much better than my original fire it is almost ridiculous to compare the two.  Very crisp, clear picture and ...TOUCH RESPONSE:  I am sure it's due to the power behind it (CPU) that the responsiveness of the touch screen and smooth scrolling are also massive improvements over my original kindle.SETUP:  It took no time at all to setup;  it linked all my old books and apps automatically.  It was seemless .. my old kindle was still warm sitting beside me and I already had this one up and running with all my usual apps on it.

Screen quality is stunning and video amazing. With the origami case there is some heft to the device and over time a unsupported hand holding it would tire. The origami case is a creative solution that works fairly well as a functional case btw. The help capability to instantly video chat with a tech is a positive experience. My Kindle arrived with special offers enabled, though I'd ordered without them. An email to customer support resulted in a reply within a couple hours, on Christmas Eve no less, with the sponsored ads removed, no charge. Incidentally, I think it would be useful if there was a way to opt back in for that content in order to receive the special offers in an unobtrusive manner. If this was controllable by the user that might be useful.I rate the poor marketing due to the following information in the product description: \"Stay productive on the go with ultra-fast web browsing, built-in OfficeSuite, and updated e-mail and calendar support for Gmail, Outlook, and more\"There is no built-in OfficeSuite. There is a built-in VIEWER.  A viewer is a very different product from an office suite. One can read documents but not be very productive if unable to produce documents, spreadsheets or presentations. This in my mind is just false and misleading advertising. A deciding factor in purchasing this product was the presence of a built-in office suite tool. You won't even know this either, unless you go looking on the product forum, as I and others have done, posting \"where is the built-in OfficeSuite? That should tell Amazon something - consumers are expecting a true suite of office tools. Either include one or more accurately portray what is on board.I chose this device after one too many crashes with my first gen iPad. So far, I'm happy with the technology. It's intuitive, easy to use and the images on the screen are exceedingly clear and sharp. Set-up was easy and fast. The very simple on board customer service is in strong contrast to getting help from Apple, which is no where near as easy. That's a definite positive factor for this product.

I had both and compared side by side, the Kindle was just all around better.  HOWEVER, no access to google voice, hangouts, maps, Music, keep, gmail, docs, google calendar, and chrome makes this tablet limited in its awesomeness.  I use a laptop for most of my internet and \"productivity\" related tasks so no integration with the google ecosystem isn't a deal breaker for me.  But it sure would be nice to be able to have hangouts, keep, maps, and voice.  Almost 100% of my IMing happens in hangouts or facebook chat, neither of which are in the Amazon market, and I would love to check my texts with google voice on the tablet.  No gmail, chrome, docs, or calendar isn't a big deal because the substitutes they have are good enough, and no music is understandable because Amazon has their own music app BUT for light social applications and looking at Maps I really wish amazon would make a deal with Google or create  decent native apps that integrates with them.With that being said, I still like the HDX 7\" better than the nexus 7 tablet because of the seamless integration with the amazon ecosystem and amazing access to content through prime. Its so easy to watch movies, play games, read comics, and read books that what little leisure time I have is spent within the amazon ecosystem.

This is slightly smaller and lighter than the HD version. That is not a plus to me because I like the wider edge on the HD. So an old case will not fit.

They are located on the back side and the kindle will require a specialized case in order to access them if it is being used in the case. They also did away with the HDMI port ! I use that feature on my original HD model frequently. Also the cable port is at an angle and off to one side. This is probably because the device is so thin. It compares to the I pad mini, but the mini has a larger viewing area.  If you have last years model I would keep it. If you do not own a Fire yet you will not be dissatisfied with the HDX.

The second thing you notice is the speed, this little guy is fast and while I agree the application store is a little limited it does well with what is available (and I am sure since Amazon is selling a lot of these things that the developers will make many more and ensure popular Apps from other devices are also offered on this...  might just take a little time for them to show up).  The third thing I noticed is the OS is clean and user friendly.  Some people might think its basic or limited but they have a very common sense approach on how to get to all the content.  when I was using this I was thinking... if I was going to get a tablet for my parents or non tech savvy friends and family this would be it.  With the clean easy to use OS and the mayday  option I could see this being a cost effective option for many people.  I end up being the tech support person for my family when anything breaks or has an issue or just end user questions so I think this device would take care of most of that.  Also after trying this out the last few days I now notice the weight of my full size Ipad and while at home I still enjoy using my Ipad the HDX is what I grab when I walk out the door.  Its does everything I want when I am out and about but in a much smaller lighter easy to use bundle.  So if you picked this up for the Cyber Monday deal of $179 this guy has a lot of bang for the buck, if you already use a lot of apple devices I am sure the Apple Mini is just as good though it costs a little more but if you want to try something new, want something that is a little more cost effective or easy to use for the more technology impaired (or if you have Prime membership) then this is worth the shot.  Amazon also has a great return policy if for some reason you decide the HDX is not for you once you give it a shot.  I think it's a keeper and I might end up getting a few more for my Parents and In-laws as I think this is something they would enjoy and could handle that would cut out the ongoing IT support I usually have to provide ;-)", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Incredible value, and just plain incredible.", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "R3PTBYQ85CD7V6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am in awe. I have just unwrapped the Kindle 2 hours ago, and I am still marveling at the wealth of features that this tiny tablet continues to display.Value - 5/5Especially if you bought it during the $50 off promotion and are a Amazon Prime member (tons of free movies + borrow a free book every month). ~$179 for a kindle fire HDX 16GB (Less than half that of a similar iPad2 which goes for $399). It can do everything the iPad2 can, and better. Just compare the two models:kindle fire hdx student gaming tablet[...]- Much lighter (303g to iPad2's 601g, though iPad2 is slightly bigger)- More than double the pixel density (323ppi compared to iPad2's 132), meaning way better graphics for movies etc- Faster (2.2 Ghz Quad core processor compared to iPad2's 1Ghz dual-core)- Better audio (Dolby Digital Plus)- Better front camera (720p compared to iPad2's VGA - only advantage that iPad2 has is that it has a rear camera)- Instant LIVE help just on the touch of a button (Mayday)- AND MORE.I do not usually write reviews, however for a truly amazing product at a great price, I am motivated. Had Apple bought over this product and named it iPad Fire, it would easily have gone for $500 and above (yes the Apple brand name is worth that much.)Kudos to Amazon for filling me with wonder at the capabilities of technology.

I was disappointed with the video application because it is not easy to browse the videos by genre.  Also I would think that you should be able to filter out videos  with mature content or to quickly see which films are included in the instant video collection.  The audio quality on the kindle is great and very clear through it's speakers.  The seven inch model is very comfortable and fits my had very well.

There are a few pros and a few cons to it though.Pros:I like the smaller size. We also have a 10 inch tablet and this one is much easier to carry around with me.I LOVE the Free Time app for Kids. I love knowing that I can hand my tablet over to my 3 year old and he'll only be able to see and play what I approve for him. I also like that I don't have to tell him when time's up. He just hands me back the tablet and goes to play.Reading on this Kindle is so nice. I love that it holds my spot and tells me how far along I am in the book. I also like that I have access to all the books I've bought in one place. It's a lot easier to carry this around than it is to carry around a heavy book.Cons:I'm not so fond of where the power button is. It's kind of awkward to find. As well as the charging port. It's at an odd angle and I have to actually pay attention to what I'm doing when I plug it in.The apps from the Kindle store are few and far between. There aren't a whole lot of them. There are the basic ones for social networking and a few good (free) games. But I'm hoping that in the near future Amazon will come out with a lot more apps.I also wish I could add more storage space to this like the android tablets. However it's not a HUGE deal because you get storage on your cloud. Which is really nice.Overall I think this is a fun little tablet. I wish I had gotten the one without the special offers as those can get annoying but oh well. I enjoy using this tablet and so do my kids.

There aren't as many apps for the Fire as you have for iPad, but I'm guessing that's just a matter of time before they fix that.I mainly bought the Fire so that I could add my very extensive book collection to it. For reading I've been using the Kindle Touch 3GB, and I have more books than I have space. I found it tedious having to add and delete books all the time. I thought the Fire would be a good step up.If you have a couple hundred books, the Fire is perfect for your book collection. But if you're like me, and have been using Kindle for years and have a 6K+ collection, you might be disappointed.First, you have to click on every single book to import it onto the Fire. There is no batching. I really wish they could have had an \"add whole collection\" option. Importing is tedious at best.Second, you can't just import your old collections and believe that all books will automatically place themselves in the correct collection. First of all, I now have collections from my very first Kindle on the Fire. A Kindle that has been deregistered from my account for ever.The collections that did import correctly, are a mess. Books are missing, or the wrong books are in the wrong collection.Then there is the books that aren't in a collection. If you're viewing your books as collections, you can't find the books that aren't in a collection. It is simply impossible to figure out which book is in a collection and which book needs to go in a collection. I like to organize my books, and collections were the perfect way to do so. On the Touch, that is. On the Fire, it's all a big pile'o'crap, and I can't figure out what's up and what's down.So far, bookwise, Fire has been a huge letdown for me. I was really excited about getting the new HDX with the 64GB hard drive, thinking I'd finally be able to put by books in order. Not so much.As far as reading experience, the Fire is very good. The screen is clear, the text easy to read, and it doesn't hurt your eyes like the iPad does. Which is the only reason I give the Fire HDX 3/5 stars. I really hope Amazon updates the OS real soon where you have the option to import your whole collection with just a few clicks. And most of all I hope they fix the collections issues.
