There was only two things I didn't like about it, first the screen quality wasn't that especially when looking on a website with a white background. Secondly sometimes things start to slow down really quickly if too much apps (like about 5) are open, but everything else about it was pretty good, wi-fi was easy to set up, apps are easy to download and it is really light. This a great first tablet to buy.", "Date": "August 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Horrible Customer Service, actually NO Customer Service", "Author": "Ashley Sinder \"Ashley\"", "ReviewID": "R2FTP41K6Z4AJH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought 2 of these tablets, a blue one and a pink one on October 15, 2012. They were to be Holiday gifts for my kids but we decided to give them early, due to a long drive we wanted to take on November 8, 2012. By November 19, 2012 the blue one will not boot all the way up. It freezes with the \"Android\" name on the screen. The pink one freezes and has to be force restarted multiple times a day.I have left a voice message with Visual Lands Technical support, and 1 message with the operator as the technical support mail box was now full...hmmm really?I have sent an e-mail 7 days ago with no return message and sent another today, 7 days later.I was told by Wal-Mart that after their 15 days returns policy on electronics it was then up to the manufacturer to honor their warranty. I also bought an extra 2-year warranty through Wal-Mart and of course that does not start until AFTER the manufacturer's warranty.So...my suggestion is to buy a different tablet from a different company because what kind of customer service does not call back? Also, what kind of company constantly sends you to voice mail?Very disappointing! Now I have one child with a tablet and one without. Those with kids will know that this is not going to work! I bought 2 tablets because I needed 2. It should not break in less than a month.UPDATE ONE:Finally after more than a half dozen attempts I was able to send the tablet back and then again, I could not get anyone to give me status.Two weeks later I got anew tablet in the mail...yay...NOT, that was TWO days ago.Now it freezes and won't turn on. I had to reset it the FIRST time I took it off the charger out of the stinking box! So now I am BACK to leaving messages and sending emails because this one didn't even work more than SIX hours!DON'T WAISTE YOUR MONEY THIS TABLET SUCKS!!!!!Now I am playing the customer non-existent game again!", "Date": "November 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good price, mixed results.", "Author": "Eric Pearson \"eric\"", "ReviewID": "R2CLTFZTE6W6XC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Good tablet for price.

It was bought online I guess and then returned to the store, they didn't know what to do with it so they discounted it 75%.  So, for the price I paid, I'm not complaining.But I've used a lot of technology, from the Kindle to ipads and all that so I know a good deal about these devices.  I also use an Android phone running Jellybean so I'm familiar with the interface for the most part.The tablet can hardly run itself. To start, but that's the most negative thing about it. It'll lock up and freeze for moments constantly while you're trying to get stuff done, open applications, install stuff, and all that. I found that when I use the base launcher (not vLauncher) it runs a tad bit better but not much.But, once you have something running (Angry Birds Star Wars, Draw Something, Evernote, ect...) it runs like a champ.  This is actually the exact problem I had with my Kindle Fire (original generation) the interface was laggy and slow while the applications ran perfectly.  But this might be to a different level.This device does Not have an accelerometer. So think about that and what you'll use it for before buying it.  Second game I installed was Temple Run and that was when I discovered this.You can install the Amazon App Store on here but for me it's become corrupted after I got 2 applications from it, twice. And not like, I restart and it works, I had to uninstall and reinstall to get it to work. GetJar never works on anything ever so don't bother with it, but this tablet comes with another app store... called the #1 appstore or something? I can't remember. But that one is the best. That's where I got all the game apps listed above and they worked great, downloaded fast, all that.My Mic is completely broken on mine, likely why it was originally returned. I haven't messed with the warrenty yet but I will later today. I don't care if they replace it or not, I didn't buy this for Skype (and the camera is pretty rough quality) but I might have an update about my customer service experience.But anyway, for what I paid, this is an awesome device for youtube, pandora, games, reading and fun things like that.This is Not a great device for internet browsing (it freezes up a lot), heavy usage or business.So take that for what it's worth.  The screen creates a pretty low quality image, but again - what you paid for, the touch interface works surprisingly well with all things considered though.  The build feels nice but you'll notice while holding it firmly that the screen starts doing the blur things LCDs do, this thing probably couldn't survive a real fall and could probably snap in half if another pressure were applied.  So yeah, keep that in mind to. Probably not for a kid to throw into his backpack to survive a ride to school.Battery life is fine, doesn't get too hot, you can expand the memory and it comes with a USB to PC adapter and a mini USB to standard USB adapter to attach devices.

The kids watch netflix on it and play games with no issues and seem to find all the apps they want despite what other reviewers say about the app selection.

Morton \"the poetic book worm\"", "ReviewID": "R3S9KRS9ZZ8C0I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This tablet is a decent quality tablet for a great price. It's fantastic for college students looking to carry their textbooks or read e-books on, has decent resolution when it comes to Netflix, e-books, and games, comes with an optional $10 1 year warranty, and has great battery life when using simply for reading and/or writing. Some cons to this tablet are that auto-rotate doesn't always respond, and, depending on how many applications are open, response time is slow or the tablet may freeze. These problems are easy to solve with an auto rotate controller app (I found one on the amazon app store) and by controlling how many apps you use. These problems are problems that occur with any and every tablet including and especially on some smart phones (I have a TMobile MyTouch and it's frozen/been slow/not responded to auto rotate several times). I love my Visual Land Prestige 7 and am happy with my purchase and the goodies that come on it and with it. This is definitely the best bang for under $100.**UPDATE**Tablet comes with connector cable to connect tablet to laptop or desktop and a cable to connect a jump drive or printer to the tablet.

All in all I am 100% satisfied with this purchase.", "Date": "July 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Inadequate instructions", "Author": "Muddy", "ReviewID": "R3OEH5PABTJH41", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The product arrived later than I expected.

It took me forever to figure out how to load apps and the manual wasn't any help but once I was able to get the apps I wanted and able to play them I was pretty happy with this tablet. Okay, but now the WIFI slider/button is stuck or if you can get it to the \"on\" position in about 5 seconds it automatically goes back into the \"off\" position which in turn does not connect with my WIFI. So I have a product that I can't use, will be taking it to a computer company because Walmart only gives you 15 days to return on electronics (hmm..wonder why)which I think is poor customer service and lack of responsibility when selling merchandise to the consumer, HEY IF YOU CAN'T STAND BEHIND THE MERCHANDISE/PRODUCT IN YOUR STORE, THEN WHY SELL IT???. After reading the reviews about the manufacturer's costumer service or lack thereof, I think i'll just eat the loss if they can't fix it and look for a more reliable tablet with better satisfactory customer service and reviews. If anyone has a suggestion on how to remedy my problem with the WIFI switch to be able to be put in the \"off\" or \"on\" position when I want to use it, I would greatly appreciated.", "Date": "July 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Horrible", "Author": "Robert Delahunt", "ReviewID": "R3A1L43B07EF4R", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It was good at first.  Skype worked and the tablet worked, at first.  The case is still horrible.  It covers the headphone and charging covers and pushes down on the volume - button.Then I tried to use 1App or whatever the default Amazon store is.  Amazon's store for android is horrible.  No matter what i search for on the Amazon store for android, I get like 5 sex application results.  Really, Amazon?!  I don't even use the tablet for anything even remotely risque!Then you can't install Google Play store.  It refuses to let you.  Even if you surf directly to the apk file and install it, it crashes upon startup every time you run it.  I suspect that Amazon has poisoned this Android tablet against Google Play.Then when I use a 32GB microSD with all my MP3s I purchased at Amazon.com, the music application started crashing for no apparent reason.  I synchronized the MP3s with my computer again to ensure none of them were corrupted, only for it to continually crash.Their customer service takes forever to return emails.  When they do, they don't tell you how to root it or re-image it with the original image.  I know because I had to do a factory restore to fix the music application problem.  They refused to tell me how to root it (I even told them that I know that this voids the warranty).  This isn't good because I can't do away with their garbage application store by going to a default Android or Cyanogen-Mod ROM, and because they won't give me the original factory ROM (the restore doesn't put the original factory ROM on it, it puts a stripped-down amazon-poisoned android ROM on it).All in all, I highly recommend that unless you plan to only use it as a Skype tablet or for light internet searching and browsing that you don't buy it.
