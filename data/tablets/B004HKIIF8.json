I loaded Microsoft Office 2010, SQL Server 2008 and Visual Studio 2010 on it without a hitch.  I can use it to show people code, and even write code with the included bluetooth keyboard.  During meetings and presentations I can switch over to one note and take notes with sound or even video recordings when I want to.  After loading it up and removing the few junk programs there's still about 15-20 gigs of space left for misc stuff and you can always get an SD if you need more storage.The Window's 7 touch screen experience is a lot smoother than I expected and it's a breeze to use the computer for multimedia apps like Zune or to surf the internet with the stylus.  Overall I'm very happy I got this.  It's a lot easier to carry around something slightly larger than a sheet of paper and about 3/4 of an inch thick than a laptop.  Even people with Macs are impressed when you flip open the case and start surfing the internet with full flash support and apps that weren't designed for a phone first and a tablet second.Update:After almost a year of use I began to notice some yellowing of the screen in the corners.  A search on the internet quickly showed me that I wasn't the only one with this problem.  I sent the unit in for repair and the only thing they did was wipe the hard drive, re-install everything, and put a paper in the box that said the tests all showed OK.  That's not OK with me.

It worked really well for about 2 monnths and I congratulated myself on finding a really slick Windows tablet which could replace my aging laptop.  While in vacation I was showing photos via HDMI on a TV set which worked fine the first time, but the second time I tried it the slate shut down completely and would not restart.  After much aggravation with the tech support people who were very hard to understand, I received an RMA number.  I then had to pay $68 to buy a shipping carton, insure the product and ship it back to warranty service in Texas.  They returned it fairly quickly and it appeared to work well again but of course, all software had been deleted so I had to reinstall and update all of it.  In the process I also had to pair my bluetooth keyboard to the system, which I had done originally without a problem.  When trying to pair it after the warranty service, the prompt to enter a pairing code allowed no time to enter anything.  It literally gave me less than 2 seconds to enter a 10-12 digit code that it generated.More calls to Asus customer no-service, including discussion with a \"supervisor\", resulted in them telling me that I would need to send it back for warranty service, again at my shipping expense.  Since this was not a re-do of the original problem, but was a new problem, they would not pay for the shipment.  This is totally unacceptable for any product and ridiculous for one costing more than $1,100!  After much complaining on my part the \"supervisor\" offered another suggestion that I go to the online e-store and get a system restore disk to re-set the system.  His feeling is that I have a Windows problem and not a hardware problem.  Of course that system restore disk sells for $50!  So let me see, I have a defective $1,100+ computer that I have paid another $68 to fix once, and still have a product problem for which I have to either pay another $68 to ship back, or pay another $50 to MAYBE fix the latest problem.  Who knows what the next problem will be?  I now know that I can't afford a product like this!I have had many computers and other electronic products in the past, some of which needed fixing and this is BY FAR the worst customer service I have ever seen!  I bought through a local retailer and am past the return period, so I am apparently stuck with this puppy.

Wanting to upgrade to Windows 7 (so I could run some real computing programs in real time for the class), this was the best choice out there -- and I've been very happy with it.One note for teaching or presenting with this -- there is no VGA port (what most laptops use to connect to a projector), so you'll need some type of adapter.  I bought the USB to VGA adapter from CablesToGo, which has worked out well.  When I tried connecting to the VGA port in a classroom, at first the display was a little choppy (with an ugly black cursor in Windows Journal and PDF Annotator), but after downloading the updated driver from the CablesToGo website, everything was smooth as can be. There is a slight delay (about a tenth of a second), which might be maddening for gaming, but for presentations (including real-time handwriting) it is barely noticeable.I highly recommend this for anyone wanting to teach with a tablet -- writing notes to post later as PDF's, while having access to the most commonly-used programs (on the Windows 7 platform), is insanely effective.", "Date": "July 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Asus does it again", "Author": "Leyland Needham", "ReviewID": "R3DQGUJA803B24", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned and have tried several brands of laptops/tablets before. Dell, HP, Fujitsu, Toshiba, and Apple, to name a few. And so far Asus has a very good track record with me, especially when it comes to the quality of the screen. So when I saw the eee slate and that not only was it an Asus product but that it had a wacom digitizer, a multitouch capacitive screen, an i5 processor and was priced under $1500, I had no choice but to get it, and I am happy I did : )So what do I do with this device? I'm a software engineer, in profession and hobby. So currently I'm mostly running Visual Studio, and learning how to develop software for stylus and touch input. But I'm also an artist, I like to visualize concepts, do sketches, diagrams and design type work. So this device allows me to do the things I want to do, things I can't completely or easily do on a device like an iPad or Galaxy Tab.I like the case, it has a nice fresh leather kind of smell to it, having a professional feel. It isn't perfect, as it can at times block the unlock/lock switch for auto-rotation of windows.That said there are things that would have made this product better.While the quality of the Bluetooth keyboard is good, it's Bluetooth. Bluetooth keyboards don't work in bios or Windows safe mode, and can't wake up a sleeping PC. Also they need to be explicitly connected, instead of being automatically connected out of the box. They should either have a bios which supports bluetooth keyboards, or replace the bluetooth keyboard with a wireless usb keyboard, or not have a keyboard at all and reduce the cost of their product.No wintab driver/dll. A number of legacy applications won't work with the stylus because of this. Gimp for example doesn't work. I tried installing drivers from Wacom's website but it crashed the eee slate and I had to go into windows safe mode to remove the drivers.USB connectors are extremely tight. I had to connect a keyboard to use windows safe mode, and it was extremely difficult to connect and remove the usb connector. I should also note that the touch screen and stylus also don't work in windows safe mode.Battery runtime is low but that is typical of the Windows x86 platform.Speakers are not great. They are better than many other devices I've used, but with the default settings I have found myself having to constantly adjust the volume rocker while watching Netflix or Youtube, but you can improve the situation by turning on 'Loudness Equalization', which is under the 'Sound Effects' tab in the 'Realtek HD Audio Manager' in the 'Control Panel' (just type \"realtek\" in the start menu search).", "Date": "March 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wonderful device for this price!!", "Author": "TechGeek", "ReviewID": "R2SP5O67L8NE81", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Lot of people compare this with Ipads.

Its basically a 12\" i5 laptop with a fantastic touch screen. I use it mostly for systems administration so remotely connecting to servers and network equipment and it works great for that. I also use it with OnLive gaming service without any problems. 1080p plays without any lag or stutter.Pros:1. Not expensive compared to other tablets when you factor in the price of accessories that are built in and come with: camera, keyboard, carrying case, stylus and cool charger with USB outlet.2. Carrying case works really well as a stand.3. Full size Microsoft bluetooth keyboard. Very easy to sync and works great when you have enough space to use it.4. Built-in camera and mic. are perfect for Skype.5. Amazing screen. Easily viewable under sunlight. Glass is a fingerprint magnet, but cleans easily with included cloth. Haven't tried scratching it, but gorilla glass is supposed to be bulletproof.6. Also works great for reading books. Comes with Kindle for PC preinstalled and optimized for touch screens. Flipping pages is as easy as moving your finger right to left.7. When you need more precision than a finger, stylus really helps, but it is not always intuitive. For example, you can scroll by pressing and dragging with your finger, but same action doesn't work with stylus. You need to use the scrollbar.8. It is lighter than I expected, even with carrying case. Very comfortable to take just about everywhere.Cons:1. Power plug is really loose and disconnects from slightest motion. I would really feel cheated if a $1K tablet became unusable because Asus saved $.50 on a power plug.2. Power button is meant to only slide left to right, but if you press it from the top while sliding, it will get stuck and shut down your computer.3. USB/HDMI ports require super human strength to insert and remove devices.4. Stylus is difficult to remove. I always have to play with it for a few seconds before it pops out.5. Bluetooth keyboard doesn't work unless you're in Windows. That means if you're reinstalling windows or trying to get into BIOS, you'll need a USB keyboard hooked up. This problem is not specific to this tablet, but I've seen other BT controllers that allow keyboard to be used before Windows loads.6. Many everyday programs (like Firefox) are poorly designed for touch input. For example, tapping on address bar doesn't always bring up keyboard. Works perfectly in IE.

I was very pleased to find that it does and has enough features to add functions for those who need more.I was surprised to find a Microsoft 6000 bluetooth keyboard in the box. It paired using the ademdum enclosed in the box. Because I needed to re-pair it after an upgrade to Windows 7 Pro (our office uses a domain), it resisted. A little known fact is that if you hold the reset button on the keyboard for 30+ seconds, the L.E.D. will alternate colors and it then pairs easily.For those wanting better mouse control than the touch screen, a bluetooth mouse should work, but there is 2 usb ports that would allow a wireless mouse to work as well. It is important to have the USB so you can add a DVD/CD device can transfer data or restore the system (although there are provisions to restore through a USB memory stick.)The screen is bright and the case serves as a stand either vertical or horizontal. There is a stylus, HDMI port as well.One of the intersting features is the button on the top that opens the onscreen keyboard so you don't have to drag it out from the side of the screen.The larger button near the screen serves as a Ctrl Alt Del key so I can log into the domain.For the size of the screen, it is relatively light, much lighter than a covertable tablet/notebook.Although a consumer oriented device, I see potential in the health field, as I am in, to market this for charting. Since the battery is not user replaceable, I will purchase a power supply for each room I use so that if it gets low, I can plug in.The power supply is small and as light as they could make it.Get one and have fun.", "Date": "February 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "B.

I use it to take notes in class and OneNote works great with it! The touch responsiveness was a little glitchy.. It froze sometimes and had a hard time switching between the pen and my finger but after I downloaded and installed the drivers it works really smoothly!Firefox 4 has touch support so you dont have to use the scroll bar on the side of the screen you can just sweep your finger across the page to scroll up and down.Sometimes it is hard to be accurate with your finger when trying to click on a small object but this is just a minor detail since the pen is perfectly accurate.It never heats up even after hours of streaming netflix to my tv from it. The longest I streamed was 11 episodes of '24' in a row and each episode is over 40 minutes long.It is really thin for all the hardware its packing and very light also.Dont have to worry about the screen scratching. Only thing is it glares sometimes and when the screen is dark you can see fingerprints all over it.The pen works even with the screen off and projecting on my tv. this makes it so i dont have to use a mouse.The USB covers are really hard to get open and even after they open they dont open very far so it is difficult to plug anything in to them.I think it would have been worth it to wait until they could knock the price down and improve the battery life; however, i was way too impatient and I am sure a lot of you are too.Overall I would recommend this!I did not buy from Amazon I bought from Tigerdirect and have the 32GB SSD and 2GB of RAM", "Date": "February 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Finally A Win7 Slate That Works", "Author": "George Allen Papapetrou \"Allen\"", "ReviewID": "R2E6GFMJZORL61", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Update 20110624:Following a comment in the Tablet PC Reviews forum I found that my EP121 display has a yellowish tint in all corners except C2.

The only thing that makes it a tablet in my mind is the lack of a direct-attached keyboard and the portability.

I'm constantly using the pen to write emails, reviews :), use my Quicken program, access websites, etc. This is a huge bonus for me personally. I'm absolutely loving it.This 64 GByte tablet was bought to replace my kitchen netbook which was incredibly and infuriatingly slow.

It's in that area where this device really shines for me.Overall, I gave this device five stars for the touch/pen experience, the screen brightness and sharpness, speed (the i5 processor is wonderful), and the leather/leatherette case which protects the device and offers different \"standing\" positions. The device is heavier, which for me is not a minus because I fully understand that this is still a computer with serious horsepower.The only minus is the battery life.

I did approach the unit with some doubts, but after being able to program and compile my applications in C++ using the styles all my doubts where removed and far exceeded.  I still cannot believe I do not need the keyboard to program with.  It is simply amazing.  Another thing I liked about using the styles is that the system can read script as well as print.  I will say, for me, that buying an ASUS product was the toughest sell, but the product is quality.  Never bought any of their products before and I am actually purchasing a second one for my father who also thinks it's a great piece of technology.PROS1) Styles - One of the main reasons I bought this type of tablet.  I like using my hands, but for some tasks a styles is more appropriate.2) Tons of RAM - 4GB is a good amount for a tablet.  I don't think many have that amount.3) Can do Developement work on it - YES.  I run Windows SQL Server, VS Studio 2010, VS Studio Express, phpDesigner 7, and Office 2010 (which has a neat pen function on the Ribbon).  I can also run command line functions.  I could really see a Network Admin on the Beach while monitoring his network using this.4) Ability to Lock and Unlock Screen - When you turn the tablet, it can change the display orientation.  To lock the screen into position is a simple switch at the top of the screen5) Can Expand disk space by 32GB- Adding a RAM card, you can expand the disk space, which is limited on my system at the moment to 64GB6) Accesories - I really liked that it came with a keyboard and Case that allows you stand the unit up and type (Though I have rarely done this.  Most of the time I am on the couch programming in a Lazy Boy)7) Button on right side - System has a button that lets you page through the applications you are running. Very kewl IMO.8) Video is premo - I am not a movie buff, but I took the time to view You Tube Videos and The Lord of the Rings movie on the system.  I was very impressed.9) Anything USB will work - Keyboards, Mice, Microphones, USB Keypad, USB Hard Drives, etc... Basically, if it runs on Windows 7, it runs on this system.Things to note:1) 64 GB is not much by today's standard, but I have an IOMEGA drive that holds all my information.2) There is an HDMI hook up I have not tried, but I believe you can actual hook it up to a monitor.  Will be testing that this weekend.3) Playing Titans of Chess Rocks - Need not say more....CONS1) Windows Home Edition - I would of liked to see it come with Windows 7 Professional or Ultimate as I now use this to run my Business from, do things at my Day job, and use for school work.  Not sure if that is a CON, but I am a tech so I like more tech oriented software.2) Display Orientation - When Changing orientation, the screen blacks out for a 1/2 second.

I originally had my sights set on the Microsoft Courier and was bitterly  disappointed when it was shelved. I am so happy now that I didn't cave and just go for a regular laptop (or even *gasp* an iPad)!  The Asus slate is a full fledged computer while still giving you the ability to have fun and be creative. The pros and cons are pretty much what other reviewers have said, but since I would eagerly check out new reviews while waiting to receive my slate (ordered on 2/19, received on 3/11) I will go over them again: Pros:  + Handwriting tool awesome! I tend to  scribble while writing (who doesn't?!) but amazingly the slate gets it right...  though it was after I turned off the auto correct  function, which I recommend.  It's pretty cool to be able to write out documents in Microsoft Word 2010 as well. + Runs windows 7  instead of some mobile OS! Would have liked to have Professional instead of Home but this will work just fine. + Screen resolution is sharp and clear. Watched a movie through Netflix and tried out Youtube no problem. + Runs pc games well (so far tried it with Rollercoaster Tycoon) using a Bluetooth mouse + Accessories a great value. Bluetooth keyboard easy to install, digitizer pen works great, and the folio is very useful (thought had a  strange odor to it initially which went away after a couple of days  of being out in the open). + Incredibly light, even with accessories. Cons:- Battery life of course could be better but the Energizer portable battery charger that another reviewer suggested seems like a good option (and it's only 5.4 ounces).- Have to be super careful with the adapter based on other reviews -I checked and so far here not seen it readily available anywhere right now ...would like to be able to treat it like a regular adapter and not worry about it.- USB cover a bit hard to pry off and device have to be  aligned perfectly to insert.

However, if you are not familiar with owning a Tablet PC you might find your new toy to be much like purchasing a Backhoe.  You can do a lot with it, but you need to learn how to operate the thing to really enjoy it.  The USB ports take some getting use to.  They can be difficult to work with but my advice is to not try and force a connector into the slot.  You need to take your time and line it up before trying to connect.  Be careful proping the device up in its \"monitor\" position and then trying to connect a device into the USB slot.  I actually caused the computer to flop over onto the desk and this gave me the ebbie geebies. Fortunately the device does not have a rotating hard drive.  The harddrive that you have on the system is one of the fastest that I have seen but it is small and you will fill it up if you are not careful.  I strongly recommend getting at least a 64 GB smart card. I would also recommend getting a Microsoft bluetooth mouse just to make life easy for you.  You will not always be using the touch display and the mouse comes in very handy.  I also absolutely love the Microsoft keyboard.  Excellent tactile touch.  Wish the home key had greater accessibility but other than that I am ok with it.  For both the mouse and keyboard I strongly recommend everyone purchase energizer ultimate lithium batteries so that you don't have to keep replacing them. I also purchase a new Axiotron Digitizer pen off ebay for about $10.

This tablet is truely great! Just received my tablet about 3 days ago and really like its functionality and power. The handwriting recognition is fanominal- I am using it to write this review. It recognizes my handwriting (even my sloppy cursive) right out of the box - with no learning. I am the CEO of a consulting firm and plan to use this tablet as my primary computer. It has the power to run large spreadsheets yet is lightweight and compact enough to carry into customer meetings to take notes in OneNote. My only complaint about the unit is they don't give you an option to purchase it with Windows Professional O/S. I had to upgrade after receiving it so that the tablet could be connected to our company domain.---------------------------4/12/2011: Follow Up Review. I have now had the EP121 tablet PC for more than a month (3/3 to 4/12) and I like it more every day!! I use it about 10-hours a day for work. It continues to be easy to use and works great with OneNote as well as all my other apps (Word, Excel, Project, etc). I did buy 2 extra charger units [...]) and now have one for home, work, and travel. I bought an Energizer XP18000 battery power pack for use when traveling but have to wait for Energizer to make the tip available for the EP121; that should extend my time between wall charges to 8-10+ hours (currently about 3.5 hours). I bought 2 extra Wacom Penabled Tablet PC Eraser Pens, model #UP710E ([...] because I was afraid of losing the included pen. They work great with the EP121. I also purchased a Transcend 64GB Class 10 Flash Memory Card, model TS64GSDXC10 ([...] and use that to store my data files. I moved all the \"My Documents\" directories to the Transcend card. I use the internal SSD for the OS and applications. Lastly, I purchased a Viewsonic VX2453MH-LED 24-Inch LED Monitor [...] for my office and connected it via the mini-HDMI connector on the EP121. It also works great but you need to set it up as an extended screen so that the native resolution of each monitor can be used, otherwise it defaults to the resolution of the EP121 (1200x800) which doesn't look good on the Viewsonic monitor. I set it up to use the Viewsonic Monitor as the primary screen and the EP121 as an extended screen.So after another month (plus) of use, I still love this tablet PC. My only additional complaint/suggestion for the EP121; aside from making \"Windows Professional O/S\" an option at purchase (it's a little painful to install); is I would like to see a fingerprint scanner integrated into the design. When you boot the system or bring it out of hibernation, it is awkward and a little unsecure to use the pen to enter your user password. A scanner would allow for easier entry of your PW and prevent someone from looking over your shoulder to compromise it.", "Date": "March 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "A Computer", "Author": "MisaMisa", "ReviewID": "R2RUI440EKN52I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a computer, not an appliance. I have an iPad. That is an appliance. There is nothing wrong with appliances, if that is what you want. I wanted one and I bought an iPad. That said, I have always wanted a proper tablet computer, not a flip screen convertible, apple doesn't have one and this comes pretty close. You should (should you)get one, but I want to make sure you know what I don't like about mine.The charger: The tip is non-standard and easy to break. Mine broke off on day one. My cat got caught in the brand new charger wires and nearly pull the brand new computer off the table. The tip snapped off. That is \"good\" I guess. Asus doesn't have a replacement (yet) and good luck finding a replacement tip The inners of the OEM is a spring-loaded basket which grips the skinny pin in the table's dc socket. You can get a smaller tip that fits in the hole, but you are not going to be happy getting it to work. There may be sparks.The USB ports: These are snugg and the small plastic port covers are a pain to get on and off. The ports in mine don't power off when the computer goes to sleep so it can drain the computer. Also, mine has boot issues at times if I leave a drive connected to the USB. Low profile thumb drives, like ones for micro sd cards, are really hard to get back out as it can get caught against the metal frame.The hard disk: This mini-sata drive is simply too new and small. 64GB is fine for an appliance intended to hold pictures and songs, for a proper computer, I think it is too small. iTune is a real space hog so I added a 64GB SD card, but a proper windows 7 machines \"need\" a good 250-500GBs (IMHO). I am managing, I appreciate the concern, but not really keen on the small drive. Like, a few more installs and updates...this baby is doing to be full.The leather case: It is nice. It has a pen holder. You need this holder in the cover because the pen slot cover can't be easily opened with the leather cover on. Also, it has a couple of flip out things that allows you to prop up the tablet, but not one pocket for a sd card? Shouldn't it be with/in the cover in case you might ever want to use/carry more than one sd card?I love this computer but it does piss me off sometimes. That is normal.

Don't judge me!  I stalked it for what felt like forever and then pre-ordered it here because it was out of stock.  I received a \"shipping soon\" notice in a short amount of time but it was still too long.  I had to have it in my hands, and soon.The packaging was really nice and it was easy to take it out and plug it in for its initial charge.  It gave me time to inspect the case it came with as well as the keyboard.  Good stuff.I've had it for a few weeks now and it owns me.  I've bought so many accessories and other things for it.  It's ridiculous.  I would recommend a slim, portable DVD drive for installing software but everything else I've purchased is simply for my greater enjoyment.I've had laptops before but never a tablet.  I expected to use the keyboard most of the time but I am surprised to find that I rarely use it.  I like using the pen instead, though it takes me forever to send an email now.  I suppose I'll get used to it.  It's more fun than typing.The case that it comes with is pretty cool.  It's very slim and the tablet portion fits it like a glove (the keyboard does not fit in the included case).  It has special velcro tabs on the back that let you stand it up like a laptop screen so if you combine it with the Bluetooth keyboard it's like using a regular laptop.  But it's better because the two portions are not attached to each other.It's zippy fast and it's really cool.  It's nice hanging out and being the one that the other people watch instead of always being the one envious of someone else's technology.  I know that sounded nerdy and I don't care.There are forums out there discussing the Slate, including people who do 3D modeling with it.  It's a powerful laptop, and it shouldn't be compared or confused with fun little gadgets like the iPad and the BlackBerry Playbook.  Those tablets are little more than smartphones with larger screens (ones that don't actually make phone calls).  They have their uses but they can't replace laptops.  At some point you're going to want to run your own software or replace the operating system.  You can't do that with most of the little tablets but you can do that with the Slate EP121 because it's a laptop.  A spiffy, shiny, drool-enducing laptop tablet PC thingy.You know you want one.

After installation of 2010 excel, powerpoint, word, one note, adobe reader, and adobe annotator, I was pleased to see that I had roughly 34GB left on the hard drive. The interface is smooth using either touch or pen, but I enjoy using the pen a little more.

There are only a few reviews geared specifically to artists, which comes as a surprise given the utility of this tablet for content creators.Let me tell you a bit about myself: I'm a cartoonist who works digitally, and I was tired of being chained to my desktop and Wacom tablet. Yes, I could have dragged out my Wacom tablet and laptop for some work outside the house. And I did, a few times, but the whole setup was so cumbersome that I preferred to avoid this. So there I was... Housebound. Not even just housebound--deskbound. All I wanted to do was sit on the sofa and draw, but I was stuck at my desk while the rest of the family hung out in the living room, watching TV.So I wanted an all-in-one solution. Something with all the power of my digital setup, with the ease and portability of a sketchpad. It had to have a good screen, Wacom sensitivity, and a decent battery.And getting to draw directly onscreen? Fuggedaboutit. Almost every digital artist I know dreams of owning a Cintiq, but with the base model coming in at around $1000, I wasn't getting one of those any time soon. And again, portability would be an issue. I also looked into buying a Modbook Pro, a tricked-out Macbook that's been converted into a tablet with a touchscreen and pressure sensitivity. But for all that, they ask several thousand dollars, which is way above my budget right now. I also considered the Samsung Galaxy, but I needed to be able to use all my usual programs, and those weren't available in the Android ecosystem.Enter: the Asus Eee Slate.Here it was. A Wacom-enabled tablet with a full operating system! I am in love with this machine. It's everything I hoped it would be. I now have the portability of a sketchbook with the ease and flexibility of a digital environment. The base model runs Manga Studio 5 without any hiccups, and I can create finished pages with multiple layers, at 600 DPI. Please bear in mind, though, that this is pretty much the only thing I use this machine for, aside from some light web browsing for reference photos. I guess I wasn't shopping for a tablet PC so much as a digital sketchbook, and at this, the EP121 excels.Re: the Wacom digitizer. I was a little worried that it only had 256 levels of pressure sensitivity. I'm used to working with 1024. But honestly, after I futzed with the pressure settings in my home program (Manga Studio) for a few minutes, the experience is as natural and responsive as ever. I don't see a difference between the lines I create with the EP121, versus my supposedly more-sensitive Wacom tablet. I also needed to get used to the fact that the cursor registers just a hair off of where I rest the pen tip, but all I needed was a few days to orient myself.I'm pleasantly surprised at how roomy the screen feels. I was used to working on a 20-inch monitor, so I was afraid that 11 inches would be a severe downgrade. It wasn't--the aspect ratio is a little odd, but it gives the illusion of more room. Also, the screen does rotate between portrait and landscape mode, which helps a lot.Battery is ok... It's about the same runtime I get with my laptop while running Manga Studio. The power brick is pretty light. I typically don't carry it unless I know I'll be parking myself at the library or coffee house for an hour or two. For drawing during my lunch break, I'm fine.So yeah... It's pretty clear I'm a fan of this machine. If you're an artist who's considering making the leap and buying this, I hope this review has helped. Even used, this thing isn't cheap. With the lack of artist-centric reviews out there, forking over the money was a little nerve-wracking. If you do decide to buy, I suggest buying an SD card for extra storage (my 32 GB model had just enough space to hold Manga Studio 5 and AVG Anti-Virus, though I had to delete poor ArtRage to do so). Also, think about buying some new pen tips for the stylus. I've found that any Wacom replacement nib will do.

Higher resolution means more screen real estate and faster processor means I can livestream while I draw without the tablet having a stroke!My only problem with it is Asus' lack of Windows 8 Wacom drivers, but I can't fault the seller for that.I will say that Windows 8 runs WONDERFULLY on this tablet. However, the program I mainly use for drawing (ArtRage) doesn't play nicely with the Windows 8 stock or Wacom official drivers for the digitizer. As a result, I'm using Windows 7 on the tablet which runs famously. It's just a bit (read: lot) lacking on touch-interface support.If you plan to use this tablet for graphic design, I highly recommend downloading a small app called 'ToggleTouch' which remaps the 'home' button from the default task-switcher to an 'enable/disable finger input' button. Believe me, it's VERY helpful since the palm rejection seems to be a bit dodgy if you don't consciously put the tip of the stylus to the screen first.Speaking of stylus, I also recommend getting a stylus that has a side button. I thought it wouldn't really be a big deal not having it, but I was so very wrong. I was using my TC4400's stylus more than the stock just because it had the side button.

My father owns an Ipad through his work, which I have been able to tinker with every now and then, so my experience with the industry's juggernaut is finite but certain.  After playing with the Ipad and owning the Asus EP121, I can say without hesitation that the tablet which I am writing this review on now is superior by leaps and bounds.There seems to be some disagreement on whether the Ipad should be compared to the EP121 and while I can see both arguments, I would side with the one in favor of comparing the two.  Just because one is very different from another does not mean there is no comparison.  The fact is, they are both tablets and they are both expected to perform competently as a mobile substitute for a laptop.The largest and most obvious difference between the EP121 and the Ipad is that the Ipad derives its productivity from the iTunes app store and the EP121 gets its productivity from the programs we use to produce.  Web designers might enjoy being able to construct a website from the bus stop, an architect would appreciate being able to sketch a design from the couch and a journalist might like the ability to take real notes with the Wacom pen.When I read reviews of the Ipad, I often find people with very specific examples of how they made it useful.  Things like, \"I use it to study for tests on the way to college.\"  If that is all you are really looking for, I understand, but in my opinion, those reasons are too trivial for such an expensive device.Folks, the bottom line is, this is the only kind of tablet out there that lets you get some actual work done.  Of course, the EP121 is also fully capable of entertaining you with real games like Civilization V, provided you plug in a CD drive, or full, yes `full' web browsing, that means online games, Netflix, etc.I am not dwelling too heavily on the negatives because if you're reading this review, you have probably already heard about the disappointing battery life, weight and size.  All I would like to add is that the three and a half hours of battery I get suits me fine and I can certainly manage to manipulate 2.6 pounds.It has been two months since I bought this tablet and so far I have not needed my laptop or even felt like I was missing something, but rather that I gained a device that I can prop up on my desk and use like a computer or carry around like a tablet.

It did the trick. I think anyone who enjoys writing over typing will be pleasantly surprised with this computer. The pen-to-screen compensation, aka where your pen physically touches the screen and where it starts writing on the computer, takes a little getting use to but eventually starts to become more natural with use. The battery life of this computer is average. Keep in mind this is a full blown computer not a tablet-toy. As far as computers of this screen size go it has average battery life of about 3hrs on the power saving mode. A quick note, you can purchase a Energizer XP18000 to extend the battery life by around 5 hrs, BUT the Energizer XP18000 doesn't come with the tip for the ep121. To get a tip that works for the ep121 for this external battery you simply have to register the battery and place a order for the tip.

Combined with the tablet's stunningly good handwriting recognition (the default OCR even without training is running 95%+ for me) make this a dream for work.  I can write, draw, edit, etc and either OCR the results or push them to another format as is, which saves me from ever carrying around a paper notebook ever again (which is what I was hoping for but really didn't expect to work, its so nice to have some blow through your expectations in a positive way).-Screen is beautiful, perfect size for productivity work and writing.-Boot time and sleep wake-up are really fast.  This is key to saving battery life, meeting getting long winded?  Put it to sleep.  Someone says something interesting?  I get a 4-5 wakeup, 5 sec pass entry and I'm in and writing.  Great tool.-Performance - I get better performance on this than I do on any corporate build laptop, or even a 2-3 yr old desktop.  I've had an RDC going, running itunes to an external speaker, and flicked between OneNote and Civ5 with no noticeable lag whatsoever.  A solid stand-alone computer.-Weight is very light, feels like I'm carrying a nice paper notebook with the nice cover that comes with.-Ports ~ remember, this is a full on Win7 PC, so you've got USB and HDMI ports to use which is fantastic.Cons- The battery life is short with bluetooth/wifi on - say 2 hrs, 4 if you turn them off.  But that's pretty much what I get off notebooks so I'm fine with it.  I purchased the Energizer XP18000 battery with this and I ran the tablet for 10 hrs (wifi off/on about half the time) which is totally the sweet spot I was looking for on international flights.  I don't blame them for this con btw, just mentioning it to be fair.- 64Gig SSD ~ I must admit, I hate 64G because windows alone takes up 30G.  128 is really the tablet sweet spot I'm looking for but since this only has 64 I bought a WD 1TB external - now I have plenty of room.  ;)Overall - I'm just sad it took me so long to find this!  Although I'm sure waiting got me through the various incompatibility points other reviewers have talked about.  If you want a very efficient work productivity tool that can still play movies/games this is a solid purchase.There's nothing like typing one minute, picking up the screen and writing down some drawings, then putting the screen back and using the included keyboard and a wireless mouse to play a game.Careful though, IPad lovers will be jealous and start stalking you!Update: 6 month markPretty much just over the top 'it keeps getting better' as I learn the nuances of working with the device.-Power: Do not be afraid of 'sleep' mode.  The tablet wakes up in 5 seconds - I've gone all day in a corporate environment one a single charge just using sleep judiciously, and without the slightest work interrupt.  A key reminder is to turn wireless/bluetooth off unless you need them, huge power save.-Charging: charges much faster than a laptop or iDevice ~ I go from zero to full in under half an hour (not a scientific experiment, but practical usage), I have an extra charger in my desk, use it on the train in at 7, can run all over, drop it at lunch at 12, and then still have 50% when I hit the train to go home at 6.-Disk space: I just started experimenting with the SD slot with a 64G SD card.  Just fantastic, hot swappable D drives, love it!  Downside - SD slot usage drains power!  Enough to notice, say take 4 hrs of useful life down to 3.5 so its noticeable but totally worth it.  If you're in a corp env, pop out your SD card, put the filler and and swap when you're back at the hotel.-Hardware: Awesome hardware, I just installed some new gen games and I can flip between a game, itunes, onenote, office, and RDP just seamlessly ~ a very multi-use device that still meets current high end software requirements.-Device size: LOVE the screen real-estate.

Battery life is depressing, averaging 2h running on power savings mode, WiFi disabled, screen time out after 30 or so seconds of inactivity and lowest brightness. The CPU is okay for day to day activities but you can forget watching HD videos (that's if you like your movies littered with lag spikes and slow downs). ANY sort of gaming fails on it and I mean any, not even Counter-Strike or Quake III, games made circa 9/11 run smoothly on it at 640x480 as well as all newer games. Music production also is very limited on this guy as a few instances of the most basic of VSTs, a few Kontakt instruments and some convolution will send it flying to >75% CPU usage in FL Studio 11. It can't even handle recording from my Presonus USB Audiobox without huge pops and delays. The USB port covers will break your nails trying to pry them open, the screen developed yellow splotches around the edges of screen and it will sometimes start tapping/clicking repeatedly the top right hand corner of the screen, the bluetooth module stopped working all together alongside, the micro-HDMI no longer is detected on monitors/TVs and the headphone jack reverted to mono output shortly after I bought it.

I was so excited when I read about the Wacom pen with pressure sensitivity, and the fact that it ran on Windows 7 so I could install my Photoshop, Zbrush and other painting software without having to switch to Windows 8. I thought I would be able to sketch, draw and paint anywhere!The truth is, I can... but in all honestly, it's difficult enough on this tablet that I don't really feel like it's worth the frustration. When I was doing my research on the tablet, I didn't take into consideration the fact that there aren't any of the buttons that I am accustomed to on my Intuos 4 drawing tablet. I understand that these types of tablets usually rely on the touch input, or at least a stylus, and have no buttons, and I was prepared to deal with that -- I didn't really consider how difficult this would make it to perform all those countless tasks that I need to in photoshop that I usually use the buttons for. While painting, it's difficult to zoom, pan and rotate the canvas, and though rotation is less necessary (since I can just rotate the tablet itself) I still need to be able to pan and zoom a lot so I can get in there and work all those nitty gritty details. And if I use the bluetooth keyboard that comes with the device to input commands, it goes to sleep way too fast, so every time I need to name a layer, undo a brush stroke, or use transformation tools, I had to wait for it to reconnect to the tablet. On top of that, the Wacom driver seems to be constantly overruled by the Windows \"Pen and Touch\" program (which is difficult to disable, and if you do your touch screen won't work anymore), and the Wacom drivers that you have to download in order for the pressure sensitivity to work seems to freeze or crash way too often.Bottom line... it is a good idea. I really still can't wait for a portable tablet that gives me even half the amount of functionality that my Intuos 4 does. This Asus tablet is close, but just not close enough. I was so excited and I couldn't wait for the tablet to arrive, but now that I've got it and tested it out for a while, I just feel a little disappointed.

Because of this, I was using the tablet  once every few weeks to access flash player content that I cannot access with my iPad, and also install the never-ending Windows updates.Last week, the power did not turn on and the charging  light was also off. The charger's own light was on. I bought a replacement charger with cables, just in case, on the advice of Geeksquad repair service, but it  did not work. I called Asus support, they told me to press the power button for 30 secs, without the charger, no go. They said they will call me back, never did. I called again today, they asked me to do same thing, did not work. They gave me an RMA number to ship the device  at my expense. When they get it they will call me about the cost of the repair. I am wondering whether I should toss this tablet, since it is not very useful to me, although it cost over $1000, rather than paying for repairs and two-way shipping. I can save that money for the new Microsoft tablet with Windows 8, may be.

After a few business days from the day of delivery, I called the repair center and I was told that my slate was fixed and already on its way back! I was told that they changed a component. I just received it and the packing slip specified the component as  90R-OK02MB1000Q.  The slate seems to work now, and I am instaling many Windows updates. The battery is charging.

If you're tech savvy enough to troubleshoot most problems, this is a fun toy, and I love being able to show/do work right in the crook of my arm.The keyboard that came with the machine works well, and i have not yet had a problem with it. It pairs quickly after it on, and is comfortable to type with.I would give this five stars, but I do have a few concerns with the slate.1. Limited storage - I bought a 128 gb SDXC card to offset the 64gb internal drive that came in the model i bought.2. Drivers - needs drivers for touch sensitivity in photoshop, and wouldn't pair with my HTC Evo 4G.3. Pen - has no right click.

I could not log in via the touch screen keyboard once I placed the protector on the screen. I plan on returning it.If you really plan on using the pen, you'll need one with a right click button. Unfortunately, they won't fit in the onboard storage bay.You may want to purchase a bluetooth mouse. Sometimes touch isn't fun. As I said... small targets.

Long before there was an App that, there were a lot of programs available some so nice you would shell out a lot of cash for Well they are all available. The big ones for me on this are Office and Photoshop.. Though I have to wait on the latter. Additionally, I can home network with my desktop which runs Windows7. Then there are a couple of great surprises. The pen can enter handwriting and convert it to text everything here was entered that way. It is also useful in OneNote because I can write and draw pictures like I'm in a real notebook. There is also pretty fantastic Speech Recognition, that will dictate a letter or open a program.Screen Resolution: I have read many people's complaints about how resolution on this monitor. I can only disagree. I believe this must be based on the current trend of ultra high resolution cell phones. I would like to explain just a few things. First a WXGA (1280\u00d7800) LCD monitor is considered HD. Second, the complaint is based on the pixel density, or the number of pixels available per square inch. The density on a normal monitor is ~100 PPI. The density on this monitor is 124.75 PPI. An Ipad2 is 1024x768 (9.7\") or 132 PPI. If you have never complained about these monitors and are not interested in paying 2 or 3 thousand dollars for the device, you will not complain about this feature.Process and memory: It has a Intel Dual-Core i5 470um with 4GB DDR3, 1 x SO-DIMM. It is a 64 bit processor. It is fast enough that I really don't see any delays. The one possible complaint is turning the screen switches its orientation and it goes black for one second instead of harm an animation.Storage: It has a 64 GB BSD. This antiquates to the speed, but it is also not a lot of memory. After all my installs I have used up around 35GB. I did give myself an extra 32GB by using the SD card set with a memory card from an old phone. Abs, MS gives you 25GB online storage and 5GB synced stage at skydrive.live.com. If that isn't enough Asus has more available with l year free trial of online storage at their website (50OGB). So while it is more than my old 8063 laptop, it is shallow on space compared to others without extras.Connectivity: WiFi and Bluetooth works as expected. No cellular service, but I was not looking.Camera and Audio: I have had issue with some Asus webcams before , but none here. Crisp without delay. The audio is stereo and fine for a laptop.Battery: Listed as 4.5 hrs. With more demanding settings, I get around 3-4 hrs of normal use. It charges without any trouble-even in use.Extras: It comes. With several useful ports (2 x USB 2.0 port, Audio Jack, mini HDMI port, and MMC/ SD(SDHC/SDXC) Card Reader). In short, you can plug a couple USB devices in, hook it up to you TV, and either expand the available memory or look at photos from a camera. If that's not enough, it comes with a Bluetooth keyboard, a pressure sensitive pen, and a case - that let you work like a pen and paper, improves navigation, and lets you pretend you are on a regular laptop, but you are on something better. I bought a Bluetooth mouse, thinking it would make navigation easier, but I never use it.Summary: This is not a typical tablet-it is a real computer. It can perform as well as a laptop, has nice drawing features, and is very portable. I love it. When factoring in all my desires, it is a good deal. I had good surprises only. The biggest downside to me is the limited stage, but it is manageable. The battery life is shorter than a tablet, but this is a slate computer, and it is acceptable. The pen works fantastically. Beware your friends will all be jealous.If you decide to purchase one, do yourself a favor-go to Asus.com and find the updated pen drivers here[...]They are listed as \"Wacon ISD_DualTouch_V7.0.2-21\" at this time. If you don't you could, have a problem with the screen not responding after significant use...So far I am perfectly happy in spite of the small storage capacity.UPDATE: I updated to Windows 8 Pro essentially when the update was available back in October or November. I had one issue early on with an update not making it through and another almost immediately with the side buttons. The first was resolved by Microsoft early on. The second was resolved by updating the drivers/software. All of that is available on Asus's website.I am very pleased with the update. The update definitely improves the speed of the computer, especially with boot and wake up times. New interface with the start menu is more convenient and less clutsy for touch than the Windows 7 interface. I liked it so much I updated my desktop (which doesn't have touch). Would highly recommend Windows 8 Pro for any people with this device still holding onto Windows 7.", "Date": "February 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great for the Artist", "Author": "petey", "ReviewID": "R172J85W1PJ56S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased an EP121 and I must say that it is absolutely amazing!

Comparing the Asus to the old Fujitsu: - the Asus is ~1 lb. lighter and slightly thinner, very important when carrying the tablet much of the day - it doesn't get warm like the Fujitsu, also very important when you are carrying it and resting it against your forearm while writing on the screen - it has a significantly brighter screen with higher resolution - it boots up incredibly faster - the battery life is about the same, roughly 3 hours.  Unfortunately, it doesn't allow the battery to be changed, like the Fujitsu - it is much easier to use; the old Fujitsu had several buttons and manual switching from portrait to landscape displayThe Windows 7 user interface is not optimized for touchscreen use, which sometimes makes it difficult to activate onscreen buttons, etc.  Also, the two-finger touch control (e.g., zooming, rotating, etc) works well most of the time, but not as smoothly as iPads.  Handwriting recognition with Windows 7 has improved compared with Windows Vista, but still benefits from training.  The most frequent and frustrating problem noted so far when handwriting is that palm rejection on the screen is not as effective as I would like.  If the next release of Windows is optimized for tablet/touchscreen computers it will be an enormous improvement.The computer boots up unbelievably quickly.  The computer runs very fast with Windows Office, internet, videos, etc. For most clinical work, a 12\" screen size is essential; I would advise against anthing smaller.  I like the locations of input/output ports and the few switches.  The pop-out writing pen is convenient, but I liked the tether my old Fujitsu had which kept the pen from getting misplaced.  Audio is quite good, both from the speakers and with headsets.The fact that the Asus comes with a nice leather case is a plus, because I travel a great deal.  It can also be used to prop the tablet into three different positions for viewing.  The Bluetooth keyboard provided with the Asus is compact and slim enough to slip into my briefcase. Adding a mini Bluetooth mouse allows me to replace my laptop, especially when traveling.  The power cord has a USB port to charge USB devices - a nice feature.

The keyboard is a bit clunky to carry around, and runs through battery pretty quickly, but works fine for at-home paper writing.

I was first going to buy an Apple Macbook Pro but then I started looking at Sony Vaios, then started hearing about this new Xoom and it got me thinking..Hey? I wonder if i can do HDMI with these tablet devices. I assumed no optical drive due to size and weight issues, and figured a solution would be an ext. harddrive.. but that would require a USB.. from what i remember older tabs like the ipad didnt have usb support... and this thing has two?? perfect! problem solved.I got hooked on tablets and what the possibilites were, so i had to do some more research with the ones I was checking out .. XOOM, IPAD2, EXOPC, and the Eee EP121.  Basically, which of these has Microsoft or an Office app of the sort,Webcam. Bluetooth keyboard (what everyone uses nowadays.. house, work, school. wireless is the way to go. I just like the freedom of hooking this badboy up to my big flat screen and sitting on my couch using the keyboard) HDMI, decent graphics card, ok battery. I usually keep my laptop plugged in all the time anyway(battery lasted 8 years), webcam(skyping is just the beginning of communications of the future),wifi (usually standard with everything now), touch screen has to be glass, windows software(just in case i can partition the hard drive and dual boot with linux(not sure if itll work with the touch OS but maybe theres one out there who knows.)) and of course flash(its windows! no brainer). The screen had to be good resolution too since that's key for tablets... viewing angles, sunlight, etc..I eventually narrowed my results down to the EXOPC, which i fell in love with immediately and the EP121.  Then all I had to do was compare processors. no questions asked. going with the EP121. dual core atom vs. I5. nice!..I just realized I got the last one anywhere except for Amazon which I believe is one left as we speak 6:48 p.m. EST. 18:48 for all you foreigners. (believe me I called every seller listed on the net to have this babies, Fry's.com was the last one besides Amazon.)Now the 32GB is selling for $1200.00!  and i saw another store selling it for more!  this thing is an investment in itself!

I wanted to use it to run pretty heavy software for FPGA design programs and it ran anything I threw at it almost instantly, with very little glitches. But I had to return it mainly because my bluetooth keyboard stopped working and ASUS support wanted me to return it to their service center, I returned it to Amazon instead as this gave me the impression that the product is not a 100% established product. Also the bad about the product slightly outweighed the good. I present the good and bad :Good:1) i5 processor - Amazingly powerful processor for multitasking2) Windows 7 - very apt for tablet PC settings.3) This tablet was made for one-note: I used it to take notes in class, and its just amazing. There are a few glitches, like stuff i wrote would get erased for no particular reason , but there is always the undo button.4) ASUS support - very prompt and responsiveBad:1) Bluetooth keyboard stopped working after 20 days. And its hard to be productive without a bluetooth keyboard with this tablet PC. If you are working on a report or anything that needs typing - typing on soft keyboard is hard. There is no tactile feedback and there is a slight lag in response of keys to touch, which makes typing very fast impossible. Also you mistype if your palm touches some other keys unintentionally2) Windows 7 is still not 100% tablet friendly, as not all tools respond to touch very well. I had to change the tool bar location multiple times as things would get pressed and applications started, while taking notes on one-note, or the tool bar would hide the keyboard prompt.3) Login is a pain after sleep mode, a fingerprint reader will be helpful.4) Battery life is low. less than 3 hours is not acceptable5) 64GB SSD is too small. half of it is used by OS and other stuff that comes preloaded.6) The stylus is easy to lose and replacement is hard to find.I might take a second look at this laptop after it becomes mainstream and has these additional features of1) Fingerprint reader2) Sandy Bridge processor with very long battery life3) GPS4) 3G/4G connectivity option5) better touch control (but this is on the OS side)", "Date": "March 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "The best slate i have seen", "Author": "R.

I think Asus is in the right direction, if this is the first generation I cant wait to see the second or third generations. i heard rumors that they released a new windows 7 Slate which has a bottom charger that fits in a dock station, that dock station has a bigger battery, hard disk and keyboard which makes the slate a laptop as well just detaching and attaching the slate to the dock station. I wanted to buy the iPad last year but i have so many windows based programs that i decided to wait, i knew that someone will eventually make a decent windows based slate and the time is right here, this is the one. some people say that this first generation slate is the bad just because is the first one but as a real Asus EP121 buyer i can tell you its just the best, much better that anything on the market so far.UPDATE AS MARCH 17:Lexar just released the 128 GB SD Card. with that baby you will hardly ever need more storage.

Blue background appears yellowish; black background has what seems to be a bluish light bleeding through, etc.  The largest area of discoloration is approximately 2 inches by 0.5 inches, so it's definitely 'noticeable'.A second area of concern : I logged a trouble ticket with ASUS, but have received no response (for 5 days now, and counting).  When you pay this much for a tablet, you expect support.Other areas of concern (though more minor than the two listed above):  - The touch screen is out of calibration in the top corner, and I was unable to find any utility for calibrating it.  The mis-calibration is slight... only about 1/4 of an inch, but it is enough to cause you to select the wrong menu item in that corner.  - The Processor speed rating (in the \"Windows Experience Index\" page) is quite slow; slower, in fact, than my 4-year-old Toshiba Tablet with an Intel Core2 Duo processor... that was surprising.

I grew tired of the tablet alternatives and the closed systems that populate the scene. Granted those competitor devices have matured greatly in their capabilities. Windows slate, though a device of this nature has been around for a while, is a bit late but not out for the count.

Also, it isn't accurate sometimes, when you are touching graphical components with your finger (like a scrollbar in a webpage).  So if that's the problem why not plug in a mouse and keyboard (or use the bluetooth keyboard)?  If you do that, what you have is a low resolution laptop.  It's kind of a failure.Which brings me to the next gripe: low resolution.
