The tablet has internal storage and local disk storage. Local storage emulates external storage and as such is considered the primary external SD card. So any SD card that you insert can only be used to access your additional files like music and videos. Apps can only be moved between internal storage and local storage This is not the fault of the tablet, it's my understanding that this is an Android limitation on devices with more than 2gb of internal storage.Although the tablet comes with 4gb of storage, you only have access to about 2.5gb of that. Lately I've been getting an error whenever I try to download anything new, even though both the internal storage and the local disk report that there is sufficient room for the app I'm trying to download (250MB and 850MB free respectively).I have yet to figure out the sort order of apps in the app drawer. At first I thought all the pre-installed apps appeared first and later apps showed up in the order they were installed. But that's not the case, as some newer apps appear before the pre-installed ones now. Placement keeps changing because apps are moved around in the drawer when they get updated. It would be nice to have everything in alphabetical order so I don't have to go hunting for it later.Charging is erratic. Sometimes it will charge normally, but I've watched it take over a day to get a full charge. At first I thought it had a problem with power strips, but even when plugged directly into the outlet sometimes it does not charge. The first tablet did the same thing the first time I tried to charge it, but in the short time I had it it was fine thereafter. For some reason the X2 seems to stop charging when it's off or in standby. Once I start to use it (while it's still plugged in) it will quickly begin to charge. After a full charge, I get a little over 2 hours of use.I found the speaker volume to be too low for watching movies, but thankfully the headphone jack works just fine.The wifi still drops in and out the further away I get from the router, but surprisingly I have been able to watch Netflix and other videos with very little buffering when upstairs from the router.I've had to reinstall XBMC once. I couldn't access any menus past the home screen. XBMC for Android is still in its early stages so I'm just happy that it works at all.THE BOTTOM LINE: The Nero X2 plays games and videos, but don't expect it to compete with a Nexus 7 or an iPad in the features or build quality department. Higher expectations will only lead to frustration and dissapointment. It's an OK tablet... not great. This tablet fits into a certain price range to serve a particular market. If it were to cost anywhere near the price of a Nexus 7, I would have given it 1 star. Because of the download errors, charging issues, and the problems from the original review, I've decided to lower my rating to 3 out of 5 stars.------------------ORIGINAL REVIEW------------------Looking at the specs alone, this tablet would be a steal at under 80 dollars. But practically speaking it's probably priced just right. If it weren't for the screen distortion (ripple effect shown in video), weak wifi antenna, and narrow viewing angle, I would have given it 5 stars. As it stands, I was tempted to give it 3, but the low price forced me to temper my expectations from the get go. For the price it's a decent tablet.Bought one tablet, returned it, and Matricom sent out another. Both tablets had plastic stuck between the bezel and the glass. And both tablets came with the ripple effect problem. The screen of the first tablet was very dark and didn't always respond to touch input. Increasing the brightness level drained the battery that much faster. I know that sometimes you get a bad unit, but since both tablets had some of the same problems I worry about quality control.In most areas, the Nero X2 would fall short when compared to a more expensive tablet. But frankly, I don't mind sacrificing a few features to get a decent tablet that does the majority of the things I want it to do. This tablet runs most of the apps I use on my Nexus 7. Including: Nook, Documents to Go, Avabel (3D gaming - graphics are adjusted for low memory), Netflix, XBMC, Hulu Plus and Subway Surfers to name a few.PROS  HDMI out  Expansion up to 32gb  Google Play Store  Plays most apps  Android Jelly Bean 4.1.1  USB charging  USB OTG  Root access  MiniUSB to USB adapter included  Capacitive stylus included CONS  Screen exhibits ripple effect  Very narrow viewing angle  Screen display not very vibrant  Weak wifi antenna  Weak speakers  Proprietary power adapter  Minimal on-board storage and ram  No BluetoothDIDN'T EXPECT IT FOR THE PRICE, BUT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TO HAVE  More sensors like gyroscope and light sensor  GPS  NFCThere is no documentation inside the box about how to reach the company. There is a web address on the outside of the box: matricom dot net. There you'll find a support email address and a phone number. I've had mixed success with customer service. Some emails have gone unanswered. I called the support number and no one answered. When I complained about the first tablet, it took 5 days to get an email response. But I also received a follow up phone call the same day. They promised to ship a new tablet out that day... and they did. That was nice, until I asked a question the representative couldn't answer. She put me on hold to go find the answer, but she never came back. I waited over 30 minutes on speakerphone before finally hanging up.All in all, it's a nice tablet. If you just need a basic tablet that won't break the bank this one should fit the bill. If they would just fix the screen and wifi issues, I'd buy more.This review was done as part of a video review promotion for the Matricom .Tab Nero X2 and I've tried to be fair and honest in my

He has downloaded endless games and is very happy with their performance, I have not heard him complain once that a game is not working correctly. On two occassions though, he indicated that facebook did not load correctly and the screen was looking scrambled, but the issue rectified itself with in couple os seconds.

I bought both the black and the blue one. So far I'm happy with it. It seems extremely responsive and no bugs so far. A few details I've noticed:* It has a mini-hdmi port and a micro-USB port. I've seen a lot of conflicting information on the sizing (mini/micro) of the ports on this model and this is what I have on both of my models.* It has an included charger, but charges via micro-USB just fine.* Battery life with moderate usage (downloading apps, playing movies, configurations) was a little over 3 hours.* Comes with screen protector, stylus, micro-USB to USB cable (for charging or connecting to computer), micro USB to USB adapter (for connecting to an external hard drive/flash drive), power adapter and headphones.* No bluetooth, no GPS - but at this price point I shouldn't be expecting it.Although it says it supports wireless N, it doesn't recognize my 5Ghz network, only my 2.4Ghz network. So it only supports one band of wireless N.I'll add more as I play more, but so far so good!
