Mine has a long crack down the middle all because I placed it on the countertop, letting it drop the rest of the way, as one end was at a 10 degree angle or less to the surface. Now, I have to tilt the tablet when I type because it won't register my pressing of certain buttons when it's upright/sideways.Also, when I watch videos, it sometimes just stops halfway through.", "Date": "January 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Quality and service", "Author": "Norm Peters", "ReviewID": "R1CS3W8GXO9IZ6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased a maylong 7\" tablet for my grandaughter for Christmas, about a month later it broke, we sent it to the company to have it repaired, now the company won't return e-mails, or phone calls, and the kid is out of a christmas gift.My advice, go to Best Buy,or wal mart and do a face to face purchase where you can see and talk to someone.
