But there were a lot of glitches. Not all my content got delivered, I couldn't delete from device, I had Japanese Kanji on my keyboard etc.... Frustrated, I put the Kindle & myself to bed. In the morning, I couldn't find the mayday button, couldn't get the Kindle to recognize my internet connection (which it had the night before)etc. Having purchased the 1st generation of each Kindle device made, I was ticked. Finally, was able to connect, through the \"help\" tab in Settings (which is not as easy to find as in older Kindle Fire) But, lo & behold, I got connected fairly quickly to Heather, a live Mayday tech. She recognized right away that there was a problem since there was no video feed. She had me \"update\" the system. And the update fixed all the problems I had encountered. During the update, the Kindle had disconnected from Mayday Heather, but when I tried Mayday again, I got Heather again( :-) )  and this time with video feed. She was very easy going, calm, relaxed and very skillful, & not in a hurry to disconnect. A very unexpected bonus to the new device.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Loved the HDX but had to choose another tablet UPDATED", "Author": "Chris E Nordyke", "ReviewID": "RYYOJCB8SSM0G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "UPDATED 5/28/14 ON BOTTOM OF REVIEW:I LOVE this tablet, and I really wanted it to be my choice.  Sadly, it was not to be.  I assessed several different tablets, making charts on hardware, performance' pros & con's etc.  Here are the HDX's pros & con's and a footnote of why I ultimately chose another one.PROS ~AMAZING picture quality.  Color conformity was the best of any of the tablets in the running.  The Nexus 7 was a very close second but the HDX's black level added more depth.  Interestingly, you lose some of that brilliance if you go up from the 7 to the 8.9.Sound was the best of all tested models.  Excellent volume, base and clarity.The on/off & volume buttons take a little getting used to, but the dimensions and solid feeling of the device help you get used to their unusual placement.  I appreciated the non-slick, rubbery feel of the HDX's covering.The Mayday feature is a great addition, and I think other companies should follow suit.  I saved myself a lot of time just by asking them a 20 second question that might have taken me 10 minutes to find searching the web.The front camera was the hands down best out of the tested competition.  It looked like a regular camera picture.  Actually, if you could figure out how to maneuver it, good camera shots could be taken with the front camera.Connectivity to everything Amazon based was, of course,  excellent.The Silk browser works smoothly, but I missed features of other browsers.The sale price is 229 for a 32gb model was great.CONS ~The blue/purple \"frame\" around every white screen is not acceptable, should not have to be \"worked around\" and is definitely NOT normal, no matter how much Amazon wants you to think it is...I really do love Amazon, but I couldn't shake this Orwellian feeling that Amazon was Big Brother & the Mayday button was put there to spy on us. :-)  Seriously though, they lack flexibility and are \"android based\" but not a fully functional android.  Picture a bird with some feathers clipped so they can't fly.If I fully understood what it meant to have NO access to Google play store, I would have considered more carefully.  It's not like comparing apples to oranges.  Well, in this case apples to androids to kindles.  Yes, they are trying to improve their app library, but they have a LONG way to go.  On a side note, I found it frustrating to not be able to use the same apps as my friends & family.Although the readability initially seems great (esp if you go to black with white writing to ignore the purple frame), you don't want to compare it with the HDX 8.9.  Side by side the 7's reading screen on white looked \"dirty\" compared to the 8.9's crisp whiteness (same purple haze on both sadly).  I kept checking the 7's settings to make certain it wasn't on sepia.IN A NUTSHELL ~I wanted to choose the HDX, loved the movie experience on it, albeit at 7 inches.  It felt wonderful to hold & performed almost seamlessly.  But I could not overcome the flaws in our relationship.I want to read books on a crisp white screen with no blue/purple border.I want access to ALL things android, apps, browsers, features, not just \"Amazon android\".I finally settled on a very close second with the Nexus 7.  I'm still getting used to the feel of it but a case makes it feel sturdier. I did, however, have no trouble getting used to having all those endless apps available to me again.Hope you all find joy this season in your tablet search!UPDATE 5/28/14Well, I returned the Kindle and kept the Nexus. After awhile I missed the Kindle so much that I bought another one on a huge sale day. I LOVE my Kindle, accept it's limitations and do the unavailable android things I need to do on my phone.The Nexus became the teenagers tablet. It never felt \"good\" in my hands. After 6 months it died. Asus customer support was straightforward enough and they paid for shipping to the warranty dept. But now, it's been over 2 weeks since they received it and I still don't have a working tablet. No updates either. I had to hunt it down online to find out that it's status was \"still in repair\".If it were MY tablet and not my teens, I'd be going nuts. ;)So, I'm happy with my Kindle but probably wouldn't be if I didn't have my Galaxy phone to get my android app fix.", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Happy with it, especially for the price", "Author": "MichaelB", "ReviewID": "R2Y0383TNKPC18", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was debating between Ipad mini and this HDX 7. My home computer is a Mac and my music, contacts and calendar are all on the Mac. I read by eBooks on Kindle touch and like to watch Amazon prime movies. So I am sort of in two worlds. At the end of the day I opted to give this a try based upon price (I got the 15% off price when Amazon had the FAA thank you special). So what do I think, well if you are used to Mac products it is hard to beat their ease of use and how you just plug it in and all your stuff automatically synchs up. The Kindle fire took me a bit to organize and set up although it was nice that all of my books came over from my Touch to the HDX, although they are placed in the Cloud and you have to download the ones you want on your device. Also any books you set up yourself go to your documents tab and not the books tab. I dealt with calendar problem by exporting Ical into Google calendar which does automatically import to the HDX calendar. I was sort of annoyed that you had to buy basic applications that come with an Ipad such as clock and notepad. Since there are several options for these you have to hunt around, read reviews etc. Also - \"free aps\" all come with ads, which is sort of annoying so I would recommend you consider getting the \"upgraded versions\" to avoid ads. Several people have complained about the light blue border on the reader - I noticed it but got quickly used to it and it does not bother me. Watching movies works for me - the 7\" screen is probably similar to watching a movie in the seat back screens of an airplane. Battery life is ok - probably need to recharge every other day with normal use.

My fault for not fully understanding its limitations But...", "Author": "Bob \"Bob in Big Bear Ca\"", "ReviewID": "R1EMZBVAQM3X7L", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "5/11/14 Update:Having had the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" for a couple of months now, my experience with this device has me convinced that there are much better options available a within the same price range.I'll go over some of the ground that I wrote in my full review below, but feel those things that I do go over are important considerations in determining whether or not the Kindle will work for you so I'll be going over the most important points here as well.First off the display.While the display looks great in general, I am a little disappointed with the brightness of the display when outdoors. I do not have another tab to use as a reference to compare it with other right now, but when comparing my cellphone (which is at least as bright as the Kindle) it seems to me they could have done something to improve the lighting for outdoors. The color saturation is very good, especially in gaming, but might have a little too much color contrast for some when watching video. When I have used it to watch movies or TV provided using Netflix or my Prime Membership, I've found that video sometimes lags. The lag could be a result of several things, including the hardware or system resources provided on this device. I have 3 computers at home and a Blue Ray player that all stream Prime Instant video, and none of the other devices have similar issues. Let me rephrase that comment. I have seen Prime lock up and lag on all the devices I own, but none of the others have the severity or frequency of problems the Kindle has. Again I would guess it's a lack system resources or possibly a hardware issue.The Flexibility of the Kindle:In terms of flexibility I guess this could be seen as subjective. Here's what I've found to be the problem with the Kindles Flexibility and one of the outstanding issues I've found with it.Amazon had set up packet blocking and redirect on their devices. This means the Kindle will not stream other media from sources. For instance I have an account with Google where I have about 130 Gigs of music stored. My media is stored there free of charge and supports large and various file formats. Though it is a competitor of Amazons Google Play does not block or redirect when you try to access media stored elsewhere. Amazon on the other hand has blocked or diverted most other devices using the Android UI or Android variant from accessing Prime Instant Video. I can access the small amount of music I have stored in Amazons cloud, but Video is blocked. Yes I can access Netflix, and YouTube. There are some sites where the Kindle will either lock up, or be redirected somewhere else. BTW YouTube streams pretty well, but not as smoothly as my 2 year old Droid does though.So four month over all opinion of the Kindle, is that it that if you want a semi-flexible E-Reader this might be a good choice for you. In my case I've found the Kindle to be too limited and it's fallen short of my expectations, and that's even comparing it to my cellphone. The lack of onboard storage (which was promoted earlier on as a none issue for modern users) has turned a real problem and the 16GB version actually leaves the user with closer to 8 or 9GB than the 16GB advertised. It does play some games well, but it has more limitations than implied (the 32GB or larger versions might be able to handle graphics better but...) It will stream Amazons Prime or Netflix Video pretty well, but music outside of Amazons services is a problem. The fact that Amazon begins charging to store music on their site after a certain point seems ridiculous, and they do drop music that you've purchased from their site unless you purchase more space. I feel that Amazon charging to store music that you've bought from them is greedy, but especially since other sites (sites like Google Play) allow free uploading and storage huge amounts of personal music and media.5/11/14...When I decided to purchase the Kindle HDX. I had been looking at several tablets closely for the past few months to use while I was away from home on an upcoming trip expected to last few weeks. And seeing the current price and purchasing options available the Kindle HDX seemed to be an easy choice to me.  Even with my thinking I understood the tablets limitations.The things that attracted me to the Kindle HDX tab, were the processor, it's 4 G LTE compatibility with Verizon, and the fact that I am an Amazon Prime member. I had read that Amazon was expecting people to use their online services for video and music so having membership I was not too concerned about the small amount of storage on the tablet. But that was a mistake on my part. I was thinking I would be able to access the movies that I purchased online with Amazons instant video, and expected to be able to access the 128 gigs of music I have stored on Google Play\", but Google Play media will not load on my Kindle HDX. Amazons cloud does store music up to a point, but it is limited in how much you can store free of charge.  There is an option to purchase additional storage, (I believe it's about $25 a year with other limitations). But the free storage is limited and in my case I've been buying music from Amazon since the 1990's and a lot of my music was displaced by newer purchases without my knowing. So now I'm forced to either purchase additional space or be satisfied with what's there. Personally I feel the additional $25 is a rip off since particularly since the purchase of the kindle and considering my Prime membership, and with other services offer free unlimited uploads of music Amazon seems pretty greedy at this pont.Here are the things I like about the current Kindle HDX Verizon compatible version.1. The processor, it is very fast and loads pages quickly, and the 2 gigs of ram is a respectable amount to assist in performance.2. The variables in personal settings, make the device easy to personalize.3. The display is very nice and video and video games look great, but noting as others have there is a blue cast around the edges which is very noticeable when reading from the device.The not so great things about the Kindle HDX 16 GB.1. The fact that the device does not support storage expansion. It bothers me that my old Droid Bionic cell phone has a SanDisk slot that will let me to expand storage to 64 gigs, but you're stuck with the memory provided on the Kindle you purchase.2. The lack of an HDMI port and to watch TV, you have to purchase a separate device provided and sold by Amazon.3. The Lack of even a mini USB port. Again my old Droid telephone provides a USB port and offers a charging device with a built in USB hub that allows me to connect to any number of external attachments, and this tablet does not.Regretfully the impact of these limitations did not come to mind when I bought the Kindle, but would have if I knew the fully understood the tablets limitations.Would I recommend this tablet to friends or family? Only if they were a member of Amazons Prime services and fully understood its limitations, including storage and the area support of their carrier.So over all, for basic users or those wanting a reading device with very nice options living in an area with Wi-Fi and who have good 4 G coverage the Kindle would probably be an OK purchase. But only if they are fully aware of the limitations of this tablet. Especially the limitations of the tablets onboard storage. 16 gigs is just too little to carry much media with you, with the device using a large part of that 16 gigs, for it's UI and OS you are not even getting a full 16 gigs (more like 10). Then tablet not supporting SanDisk memory expansion (which seems contrived to me), leaves the user too dependent on Amazons premium services for my tastes.(Update 4/14/14) The packet blocking used to keep people tied to Amazons Media Content (or at least their Music App) needs to be removed. In my review above, I mentioned that I have had issues accessing my music stored on My Google Play Music site. But at that time I wasn't sure that this was my being impatient, not waiting for the site to load completely even though I did wait for five minutes, or if it was Amazon using packet blocking and redirection to keep people tied to their services. More recently I found that when trying to access my music on the Google site I was redirected to  the \" My Books Recommendations\". I believe the Kindle site offers better deals, and has a wider selection than Googles offerings, but Googles music site includes downloads at the same cost and higher resolution (320 Kbps vs. the 190-240 Kbps at Amazon). More over recently a few friends told me they have run into the same issue when trying to access their media stored at other various sites (that are either free or that do not charge what Amazon does for their \"Premium Cloud Services\").As someone else has mentioned in their review of the Kindle. Amazon has included adds on the Kindle HDX that are not present on other tablets (even basic inexpensive Android tablets do not have invasive adds). If I pay Amazon another fee I understand I can have those adds removed. But all of these fees really add up, and it seems to me that since I've already paid for this device, these additional fee's, and packet blocking with proprietary redirection are unacceptable and possibly illegal. Who Gives amazon the right to block content and force you to view advertisements on a device of this nature!At this point I would honestly suggest looking elsewhere unless your absolutely sure that the problems mentioned above will not come into play for you or the one you are purchasing this device for. The idea of an e-reader with expanded abilities is one thing, but to advertise the Kindle HDX as a tablet able to compete with an I-Pad, and then throw things like site redirection, packet blocking to limit access media storage to their proprietary services makes me wish I had purchased anything other than this device.", "Date": "March 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Oh dear sweet baby Jesus...I'm in love!", "Author": "HotMessPrincess", "ReviewID": "RGGLLVVS9K0E9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Can I just say that I love this new Kindle Fire HDX 7\" (64 gig) so much that I'd make out with it if I wasn't persnickety about getting drool on the glass?Where to start...First, I should confess my sins. Last May, I abandoned my first generation Kindle Fire for a brief affair with an Asus Google Nexus tablet. Sure, it was good looking and seemed to work just fine but in the end it left me feeling empty and cold...and feeling guilty for cheating on Amazon just because there's no Microsoft OneNote app available for Kindle. Four months of very little Amazon love had me begging to come back - and when the HDX was announced, I found my chance and grabbed one. I'll learn to love the Evernote app instead of OneNote, but please never separate me from Amazon again. \u00a2\u00beThe display is breathtakingly sharp and beautiful. It's such a great picture that I had trouble focusing on the movie because I was in awe over how clear and sharp the image on the screen was. Hubby caught me staring at it with my yap wide open, a frozen expression of awe on my face. (I think he might have been a little too happy to find me speechless.)The sound is phenomenal, especially for such a little device. I really didn't think there would be much difference between the Google 7 tablet mentioned above and the Kindle Fire HDX but there is a HUGE difference. I'm so glad. This little bad boy puts all other tablets to shame. When the sound started playing out the speakers I flipped it over and started looking for them...I have no idea why or what I expected to find, but the amazing quality of sound blew me away. It was almost surround sound-ish, if you know what I mean.The Fire works the same as I remember with my first one. There's a carousel containing your most recently viewed content and a favorites section below. I wish there was a way to store my content in categories like the old Kindle Keyboard. I miss being able to put all my reference books together, all my fiction together, and so on - but I'm told that there's a software update coming in mid-November that will allow us to do just that. Again...I love you, Amazon!I bought the Fire with ads on it, which isn't like it sounds at all. There are no pop ups in the middle of what you're reading/doing/watching. The screensaver provides suggestions is all. That's it. And there's a very tiny window underneath the carousel that suggests content similar to what you're reading/doing/watching already. I actually like it...because I might miss something otherwise. It's very non-intrusive (is that a word?) and I have no issues with it.Ease of set up is amazing as always. Amazon is truly a customer friendly company and I will never stray again. I am so happy to be back in the fold of happy Amazon customers. This is the best purchase I've made all year.

It has a very sharp screen, it's very easy to use, and the price is right. It's the best tablet to consume Amazon content (along with the larger 8.9\" Fire HDX tablet) and one of the two best 7\" tablets for the price (along with the Google Nexus 7).At the end of the review, I compare the HDX to two other tablets you might be considering, which are the newest version of the Kindle Fire HD and newest version of the Google Nexus 7.If you own the previous version of the Fire HD and are thinking of upgrading, the two main differences are the HDX eliminated the HDMI port and added the ability the download some Prime movies and TV shows. If you are happy with your Fire HD, unless you really need to download movies and TV shows, I don't think there are enough improvements in the HDX to warrant buying it.The Fire HDX is primarily designed to use content from Amazon, like videos and books. If you have a Prime membership, you also have access to all the free Prime videos, many of which you can now download, instead of only streaming them.  However, Amazon's app selection is weak. So make sure you check that the apps you want are available from Amazon before buying this tablet.SETUP - Some people have complained about having difficulty setting up some of the older Kindle tablets. For me, the setup of the Fire HDX was quick and easy. It only took a minute or two to get going, then I entered in my Amazon account information and I was good to go. No problems at all.SIZE AND WEIGHT AND HOLDABILITY - At 7.3\" x 5.0\" x .35\", it's one of the smallest 7\" tablets.  At only 10.7 ounces, it's light enough to hold for extended periods of time. The back is a hard rubber, which is rubbery enough not to be slippery, but not so rubbery that it's mushy.SCREEN - The HDX has a 1920 x 1200 screen. The quality of the screen is as good as the 1920 x 1200 screen on the Nexus 7, and better than every other 7\" tablet I've tried.  I especially appreciate the ability of the high-res screen to show small text very clearly, which is helpful when browsing the internet.I like bright screens, but the HDX screen was actually too bright at 100% brightness. So I turned it back down to a brightness of about 75% which is bright enough without being too bright.The only problem I have with the screen is that it is very reflective, easily the most reflective tablet I've ever used. The reflections are the worst when the screen is mainly black, which happens often because the main screen of the tablet is black. I eventually figured out that if you angle the tablet slightly away from you, or slightly toward you, much of the reflection is eliminated.SOUND - The speakers are in the back. I would prefer them in the front. In any case, even though the sound is going away from you, the speakers are still loud enough. The sound quality is decent, but nothing special.WI-FI STRENGTH - The Fire HDX has two Wi-Fi antennas which are supposed to give it better Wi-Fi connectivity than most other devices that have only one antenna. I walked around my house with the HDX, the Nexus 7, and two cell phones and the HDX usually had one more bar of signal strength than the other three devices did.When close to my router, all the devices were able to load websites at about the same speed. When I was much farther away from the router, the HDX had a slight speed advantage.ON/OFF BUTTON - The On/Off button is on the back of the tablet on the left side. It's located pretty close to where I put my hand when I'm holding the tablet.  I have already accidentally turned the tablet off three times. Really annoying.When I'm trying to turn it on, it's quicker to turn the tablet over to find the On/Off button.  I think that having the On/Off button on either the front or the side, like most tablets do, would have been much better.Some tablets and smart phones have an On/Off button that needs to be held down for 1 or 2 seconds in order to turn off. Not this tablet. Hit the On/Off button accidentally for even a tenth of a second and it turns off.The volume button is also on the back, on the right side. That didn't bother me as much, because I don't need to change the volume that often. And even if I hit it accidentally and make the volume go up or down, that is a lot less annoying than accidentally hitting the On/Off switch and turning the tablet off in the middle of reading a book or watching a movie.DOWNLOAD AMAZON PRIME VIDEOS - AWESOME!In my opinion, this is the best thing that Amazon has added to their new HDX and HD tablets. In the past, if you wanted to download a movie or TV show, you had to buy it. But now you can download some Prime movies and TV shows and watch them when you aren't connected to the internet. They stay on your tablet for 30 days, at which point Amazon deletes them whether or not you've watched them. (If you have already started watching it, and you try to watch it away from a Wi-Fi connection, you only get another 15 days to finish watching it before it gets deleted.)Be aware that Amazon has not secured the download rights to all Prime movies. In fact, only about 30% of the Prime movies I wanted to download were downloadable. But there are still plenty to choose from. Also, quite a few TV shows that are a few years old can be downloaded for free.The internet at my house is somewhat flaky, always seeming to cut out for a minute or two right at the most exciting part of a movie. Now, whenever possible, I'm going to download the movie to my tablet, and then watch it from the download. That way, I never have to worry about the streaming being interrupted. So I don't find the new ability to download Prime videos only useful on the road. I will be using it at home as well.EASE OF USE - I think that Kindles are the easiest tablets to use.  The top row on the home screen has options like \"Books\"  \"Music\"  \"Videos\"  and \"Web.\"  Even if you've never used a tablet before, as long as you can read, you can figure it out.Amazon is making a big deal about their new Mayday customer service that will bring a live person onto the screen of your Kindle HDX to teach you where things are and how to use the tablet. It's an interesting idea, but I don't think most people will need it. This tablet is pretty easy to figure out by yourself.BLUETOOTH - The HDX has Bluetooth and it works fine. I don't know what else to say about it.SPECIAL OFFERS - If you are worried that \"special offers\" means you are consistently bombarded with ads, don't worry. An ad only appears one time when you turn the tablet on.  As soon as you go to the next screen, there are no more ads. (Hopefully Amazon doesn't change this down the road and start bombarding me with ads.)PARENTAL CONTROLS - There are a few different ways parents can restrict their kids' use, like limiting them to a certain amount of time, or restricting certain categories, like video games for example.APPS - On a Kindle, apps should be spelled \"oops.\" As in \"Oops, there aren't very many of them.\" Right now, there are about 1 million Android apps, and on the Kindle you can only get about 10% of them.I know some people think \"10% of 1 million apps is still 100,000 apps which is plenty.\" Well, that depends.  Let's say an app that is really important to you, like the app for your bank so you can do banking through your tablet, isn't available on the Kindle. If you thought it would be available, but after buying the HDX you find out it isn't, you probably won't be too happy.So double check Amazon's app selection before buying this tablet.OTHER DOWNSIDES - The HDMI port that existed in the previous Kindle HD no longer exists.  (I say \"previous\" because the current Kindle HD also doesn't have an HDMI port.)  The HDMI port was useful to show videos from your tablet on your TV. Instead of using an HDMI cable, the Fire HDX now has the ability to mirror your tablet screen to Miracast enabled TVs and devices. I don't have Miracast anything, so that isn't helping me. Adding Miracast to the tablet is fine, but I would have liked to also have an HDMI port.There is no SD card slot, so there is no way to expand the memory after you buy it. Which leads into the next thing which is how many GB of memory you will need.16GB vs 32GB vs 64GB VERSIONSI downloaded several HD videos at the highest HD setting (there is more than one HD quality setting) and they took up about 1.7 GB of storage per hour of video. I realize that other HD videos may be a little more or less GB per hour, but using 1.7 GB per hour as a rough guide, here is the maximum amount of HD video you can download:16GB  (10.9GB available) - 6.4 hours32GB  (25.1GB available) - 14.7 hours64GB  (53.7GB available) - 31.5 hoursThe worst standard definition videos I found took up 330MB (which is .33 GB) of storage per hour. So multiply the hours above by 5 to get an estimate of the maximum number of hours of SD videos you can download. Once again, this is a just a rough estimate, because other standard definition videos may take up a little more or a little less MB per hour.FIRE HDX vs FIRE HD  (THE NEW HD, NOT THE OLD HD)The HDX is a fraction of an inch smaller and 1.5 ounces lighter than the HD. The difference was so small that it didn't really matter to me.The Kindle HDX screen (1920 x 1200) has a higher resolution than the Kindle HD screen (1280 x 800). With movies and books I couldn't tell the difference. Both tablets looked equally great. The only time I noticed the difference was browsing the internet. Trying to squeeze all, or most, of a web page into a 7\" screen makes the text pretty small, and the HDX did a better job than the HD of making small text very crisp and easy to read. Although I must say that the HD was still pretty good.The HDX has a camera and microphone and the HD doesn't. Even if you don't plan on taking photos or videos, the lack of a camera and mic means you can't do any kind of internet calling, like Skype, for example.The HDX has the new \"Mayday\" feature which lets you contact Amazon customer service right from the screen of your tablet. The HD doesn't have this.The HDX has a faster processor. I didn't notice any difference between the two tablets while reading books, watching videos, or browsing the internet.  The HDX is probably better than the HD for playing video games. However, since I'm not into video games, that's something I didn't try on either tablet.The HDX comes in either WiFi or WiFi/4G versions, while the HD only has a WiFi version.Some people think that only the HDX has the ability to download Amazon Prime Videos, but actually both tablets can do that.FIRE HDX vs GOOGLE NEXUS 7  (THE NEW 2013 VERSION)The hardware is similar. Same screen resolution (1920 x 1200), about the same weight, and both have a camera and a mic.The Nexus 7 is taller and narrower than the HDX, which makes the Nexus 7 slightly easier to hold in one hand. (By \"one hand\" I mean with your thumb on one side and your 4 fingers on the other side.)The Fire HDX has a faster processor, but I didn't notice a difference in speed when actually using the tablets. The Nexus 7 has both a rear and a front camera, while the Fire HDX only has a front camera. The Nexus 7 has GPS and the Fire HDX doesn't.But I think that the most important differences are what you can do with it.The main features that the Fire HDX has that the Nexus 7 doesn't - The HDX has the Mayday customer support feature and the ability to download Amazon Prime Videos.The main feature that the Nexus 7 has that the Fire HDX doesn't - The Nexus 7 has all the apps in the Google Play store, as well as GPS.So you'll have to decide what's more important to you. Amazon Prime Videos in general and the ability to download them in particular?  Or the ability to use every Android app that exists as well as GPS?CONCLUSIONThe Fire HDX is a very good tablet. It has a great screen, it's lightweight, and the price is right. All its missing is GPS, a camera on the back, and about 1 million Android apps.Why did I buy the Fire HDX? Well, I already have a very nice Android phone, which has a camera on the back and GPS. I always have my phone with me, so if I need to use GPS or an app, I do that on my phone. I don't need GPS or a bunch of apps on my tablet.I bought the Fire HDX because it's better than my phone for watching videos, reading books, and browsing the internet. Throw in the fact that I can now download lots of Prime movies and TV shows, and I'm happy with this tablet.But before buying this tablet, or any Kindle tablet for that matter, you should make sure that the apps you need are available on the Kindle. There are a number of important apps, such as apps from Google, apps from banks, etc. that you might want to use. The other major Android tablets, like the Samsung Galaxy tablets and the Google Nexus 7, have all those apps, while Kindles only have a fraction of them.If you want a high-quality tablet for watching videos, playing music, reading books and magazines, and going online, this tablet will work fine. But if you want a tablet that has unrestricted access to every app out there, you'll have to look elsewhere.", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Purple edge screen, resizing issue and apps", "Author": "T S \"8bit\"", "ReviewID": "R2DX6ZZZ7318J5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "OK, the Kindle HDX tablet is faster, thinner and meaner. Its interface is much improved over the previous generation.

There are a lot discussion about this on the product reviews and it is true. Personally, the color becomes so distracted that I no longer enjoy reading from the device.2) Resizing issue. When you enlarge the display (in email or browsing), the device does not do auto-fit to or wrap the text to next line. This is very annoying, as you have to slide back and forth to see the full text. This is not the case with other Andriod device or phone. For me, it is unacceptable that I have to keep my finger on the screen, almost all the time, sliding it back & forth, left & right to see the whole content of an email or a web page.3) Amazon app store still is lack of common apps that user take for granted.

In my mind the fact that that the screen flaw is most apparent when using the Kindle as an e-reader (one of it's marquee features) points to a critical failure in Amazon's QA process for this device.  Frankly, Amazon should be embarrassed.I debated between exchanging the device and returning.  For my sake and Amazon's I've decided to return it.  I don't want to go through multiple exchanges to find a screen without this flaw.  Also, reports of Amazon's customer service rationalizing this screen defect as \"normal\" puts a bad taste in my mouth because it reminds me of all the rationalizations and backpedaling Amazon went through with respect to the very real issues the first generation Kindle Paperwhites had with defective front lit screens that had green/pink blotches.I'll consider repurchasing what is otherwise a great 7 inch tablet when Amazon officially acknowledges the screen issue as a defect and confirms that it has rectified the problem either in software or in the manufacturing process.tl;dr version -- Amazon claims the Kindle Fire HDX screen is the best available.

Magazine subscribers - you CAN buy this Kindle", "Author": "Mark Bail", "ReviewID": "R1M26265LB668Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "UPDATE!Upon posting my original review (maintained in its entirety below), I was contacted by Amazon's Customer Service. Cody wrote me an email and tried calling twice as a follow up.  He was able to demonstrate that I could keep my magazine collection on the new Kindle HDX (Solution: once the magazine is downloaded, press and hold the issue until a pop-up window appears.  Select \"Keep\" and the issue will be kept indefinitely).  I now have my complete collection of PC magazines on my HDX available when needed.Prompt customer service can change a bad situation into a good one, and in this instance that has happened.  The original review was posted on Sunday and Cody had responded on Monday, the following day.  As a loyal customer, I appreciate the effort by Amazon to provide quality customer service.  I know it's not cheap.As a result, I have changed my rating from two stars to four.  If I could bifurcate my rating, I would give customer service five stars and the HDX four.  Specific to the HDX, the battery life seems to be shorter.  I only get 2 days of mild usage, whereas I could go 5 with the original Fire.  It also has some idiosyncratic features I'm not certain I like (e.g., using the camera to automatically power on if the cover is opened, which would impact battery power), though I have not been able to investigate whether this is an option that can be toggled off.Thank you, Amazon, for your excellent customer service.I hope this helps.ORIGINAL REVIEW: Magazine Subscribers BEWARE - I recommend you NOT buy this KindleORIGINAL RATING: ** out of 5For anyone not planning on purchasing or subscribing to magazines or newspapers, you can skip this review.  But I strongly feel I need to let potential buyers know that Amazon has implemented an arbitrary cap on the number of magazine issues you can download to your Kindle: two.TWO!!I own the first generation Kindle Fire and when I originally purchased a magazine subscription, it informed me the Fire would keep 6 issues and then begin removing them as new ones arrived (I actually have 8 on the Fire right now).  I understood the original Fire only had 8GBs of storage.  I reasoned, 'Amazon is limiting the number of issues because of the limited storage space.'  I got it.  In fact, when I purchased the HDX I bought the 64GB version (the max available) so I could maximize the amount of information I could carry.  I should mention I bought the 7\" HDX, 64GB and the non-4G version.I received my HDX Friday night and by Saturday morning was downloading my magazines.  I thought, 'Finally, I'll get access to my whole library if I ever need it.' I subscribe to PC magazines which contain tips, how-tos, troubleshooting advice, software reviews, etc.  Since my friends realize I'm a PC hobbyist, I often get asked PC questions and many times I know I've read the answer, so I just need my magazines to be available to find it.  Obviously, if one of the first things I did was begin downloading my magazines, it was a major reason why I purchased the HDX.  But, I digress.As fast as I was downloading, I realized they were disappearing on my HDX.  I finally realized there was some cap to the number of issues and the default was \"two\", so all I needed to do was adjust it...but I couldn't see how.I could not believe that I would be using Mayday one day after I received the HDX, but there I was.  To Amazon's credit, Wilfredo (Mayday assistant) and Mike (technical support) were both professional and courteous.  And I believe they were equally surprised that I could only download two issues to the HDX at a time.So, as it is right now, Amazon has implemented a software cap on Newsstand (which includes magazines and papers) of 2 issues per subscription.  Why?  I have no idea (and neither did anyone else I spoke with at Amazon).  It doesn't make sense.  Could you imagine if Amazon placed a limit of 2 on everything (2 albums from a single artist, or 2 books from a single author)?By writing this I want to warn customers and I hope Amazon will see it and remove the silly limit.SO...how'd I come up with a 2-star rating?First, I don't plan on returning it (if I did, it would receive 1 star).  I will use this for more than my magazines and from the looks of the other reviews, it performs admirably in all the other functions. Per Amazon, 3 stars indicates \"it's okay\"; and since it is NOT okay to me, I can't give it a 3 star rating.  2 stars means \"I don't like it\" which right now is the appropriate rating:  with this 2 issue limit, I do NOT like the HDX - it's a horrible restriction and it needs to go.I hope this helps.", "Date": "October 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great value for the price!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R16KKIG549WA3I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "GRAPHICS DISPLAY:  In one word and considering the price for this tablet---WOW.  With 323ppi, the 7\" HDX blows away the 1st gen iPad mini and even the latest iPad Air and is on par (within 3ppi) with the upcoming iPad Mini Retina and matched evenly with the Nexxus 7.PERFORMANCE:  This one is fast.  I have a 4th gen iPad that stops/slows down during certain games.  Not with the Kindle HDX.  No slow down or crashing at all.  I can wiz through the menus, the web, and within apps and entire experience is fast and responsive.SIZE/WEIGHT: Admittedly, I would have preferred a display closer to 8\", but the 7\" size is definitely not much of a sacrifice, considering the feather weight of this tablet and ease in wrapping my hand around the edges of both sides.VIDEO:  It was probably the new option to download some Prime video content for use when not connected via Wi-Fi that influenced me most in my decision to buy this latest generation of the Kindle Fire.  Not every video has this option, as it's my understanding Amazon is working to secure permissions from the various movie studios, but it's available on enough content right now that I had no problems finding several movies and TV shows to download for use when not connected.  Plus, the integration of video content with IMDB is neat. I bought a 32GB unit, mostly in anticipation of downloading Prime video content for use offline.  if you plan to download much content, I would urge you to consider either the 32 or 64GB models, as 16GB fills up fast, especially if downloading HD versions of movies and TV shows.AMAZON EXPERIENCE:  If you are entrenched in a lot of the Amazon universe---Prime, Kindle, Audible, and Amazon MP3 music it makes for a beautifully integrated experience.  In addition, the Amazon App Store contains most of the biggest, most popular games and apps that can be downloaded and used on the Fire.  Granted, not every Android app found on Google Play is available in the Amazon App store, but for me personally, the ones I use on a daily basis are there.PRICE:  When considering the technical specs and user experience, you'd be hard pressed to beat the price.  I purchased my Kindle HDX last week and then yesterday when Amazon announced 15% off special,  I logged into Amazon. com and chatted with a rep and they happily applied the discount retroactively to my order, so got my 32GB HDX for $228.65.  I fully expect Amazon to do something similar around the holidays to entice more sales.WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE? Amazon gives you a 30 day return window, so if you're on the fence about this, I'd say go for it and see how much you like it.  If it's not for you, Amazon has one of the smoothest, easiest, fastest return systems I've ever dealt with.WHAT ABOUT THE BLUE TINTED EDGES?  It does exist...but it has absolutely no impact on my viewing pleasure.  I read my Kindle content via a black screen with white lettering, because it's easier on my eyes, so I don't even see the tint when reading which is where I have heard the majority of complaints.  I can see it if I look hard on a web page, but for me it just doesn't register.  Your mileage may vary and that's why you have a 30 day return policy.BATTERY LIFE: I'm getting about 6-7 hours of use per day while connected to wi-fi and with streaming a few hours of video & several hours of online game play. It could be better, but I'm able to do what I need to on a daily basis and I just charge it nightly, or after heavy use. It seems to be a little slower charging though than last year's Kindle Fire HD, so overnight charging is best.DISCLAIMER:  I enjoy tech, but I am by no means overly attached to any one manufacturer or OS.  Personally, I own an iPad 4th Gen, Kindle Paperwhite 1st Gen, Samsung Note 3 mobile phone, and now a Kindle Fire HDX.  I love each device for what I use it for, regardless of whether it's Apple iOS, Android, or Amazon.

At first I thought its small size & light weight was indicative of poor quality, but I was so wrong!  This device is a powerhouse and now I appreciate its smaller size and weight.  I can use it for hours without straining my hands.  Now my older KFHD feels as heavy as a brick!Watching videos on this device is such a treat!  The color is gorgeous, vivid and vibrant.  The picture is amazingly clear and sharp.  This screen puts my first generation KFHD to shame!  As an Amazon Prime subscriber, I'm able to download Prime videos instead of just streaming them, which really comes in handy when I'm away from WiFi.  There's a huge selection of t.v. episodes available for download, and you can choose which picture quality you prefer (the higher the quality the more time it takes to download & the more space it uses).  I find that the videos use up a lot of storage space but you can easily delete them once viewed.The pictures that I downloaded from Facebook,  as well as all the screenshots I took, are GORGEOUS!  Their clarity & rich color is amazing!I feel the sound quality isn't as good as on last year's model, and it doesn't get as loud as I would like.  And that is really my only complaint.  A good set of ear buds makes a HUGE difference though.It loads web pages, videos & apps EXTREMELY fast, literally in a blink of the eye!  What a pleasure this is compared to the first generation KFHD, where you just watch that circle going around and around.  This is due to the speedy 2.2GHx quad-core processor which is advertised as being the fastest processor available on a 7 inch device.I find this device extremely responsive to touch, more so than the first generation model.  You can make the items in the carousel (which is a collection of every book, app, video, and song recently purchased or accessed) literally fly by.  In addition to the carousel, the \"home screen\" (which is what you'll see when the device is powered on), allows you to place your favorite items underneath the carousel for quick and easy access.  I love the new feature which allows us to view and access recently used apps & books with a quick swipe to the left without having to exit & go back \"home\" first.This device has no problem finding and connecting to WIFI automatically, and I have yet to receive an authentication error which happens frequently on my first generation KFHD.I've used the Mayday button twice, and my first attempt was aggravating because there was so much static, but my second experience was wonderful, with a friendly, knowledgeable agent.Some people are complaining about it taking so long to charge & then not holding the charge very long, but so far my device charges pretty quickly, even when I use it while it's charging.  I get approximately 8 to 9 hours of use per full charge, depending, of course, on how it's being used.I can't wait until mid-November, when a software update will give us the ability to sort our content into collections!!I highly recommend this little gem, which has been attached to my hand since I took it out of the box!!  :)", "Date": "October 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "UPDATE 11/8 - NEW hdx - Same Problem - Four Stars - But Returning It Bcz Blue Tinge Border Very Distracting", "Author": "Expert Reader 1 \"Spot On Review\"", "ReviewID": "R37EYAZC7C81NR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Got it today.

I LOVE AMAZON. I am a big fan.  But this is a clear design flaw or manufacturing flaw.MY EDUCATED GUESS is that this is Amazon contractor manufacturing versus Amazon engineering department fighting in the background.  Since Amazon's contracting factories already produced millions, Amazon doesn't want this as a 'defect' fight in the public eye.  Amazon is taking a page from the iPhone Antenna debacle.  Remember when Apple claimed it wasn't a design flaw, but quickly redesigned it for the newly manf. units?  Remember when Amazon had a bleeding light issue with generation 1 Paperwhite Kindle?  It spinned that too, then fixed it.While Amazon is spinning this as acceptable.  It's not for me.  Nor will it be for a significant number of people.  It's too distracting.  Amazon will fix it.

I also us a second gen Nexus 7 and iPad Mini Retina.  Often I use a smartphone, like a Note 3 or Icon.  I will compare the HDX7 to these.First is screen.  I nailing this because this is the big problem.  This is supposed to be a book reader.  But that purple/violet glow intruding into the readable space is awful.  And it does not disappear regardless of your background settings - black, amber (my favorite) or white, it's always there.  Sadly it's MOST apparent in amber, which color is otherwise the easiest on your eyes.As a video display device, for movies and such it seems much better.  I suspect it's just not as noticeable with things going on on-screen.  It's there, but doesn't seem as bothersome.  But the screen is why I returned it.  Of the devices I mention, the best screen by a long way is the Nexus 7.  It's a nice reader.  Far better than the HDX.  The iPad came in last because while screen res is fine, you cannot get a decent sepia from it.  Sepia is nearly white.  Oddly. the iPad supports that cool page turn animation while the Android and WP and even the Kindle do not.As for watching movies, I think I have to give the nod to the iPad.  Sound is good on the iPad - nearly as good as the HDX.  Make no mistake, the HDX sounds great.  I hate to be repetitive, but that damn screen really sucks.  If you read the other reviews, it gets hammered for that constantly and Amazon pawns off some lame excuse about how their great display technology is so wonderful you should be happy to pay the price of that violet glow.  Well, the display is nice in the center.  But it's no better than the N7.  So, sound and display for movies goes to iPad, plus you can download your movies to the iPad just like the HDX.  You cannot, unfortunately, watch videos on Android.  Why Amazon doesn't allow this is stupid and beyond me.  You cannot BUY movies from iPad, but that is the only disadvantage there.As for use as a tablet - the HDX is very clearly focused on use as entertainment, centered on Amazon.  There is little there that is free, unlike Android or iPad.  What is available is available ONLY through Amazon.  You cannot use Google Play to fetch apps.As far as performance goes, no quibbles.  The HDX screams.  It's very fast and smooth.  But then so are the other tabs, with the N7 being slightly slower.So, the summary.  If you were able to buy titles using the iPad, I'd say forget the HDX.  Get an iPad.  It's a far better general purpose tab than the HDX, and every bit as good as the HDX for movies and reading.  If you could WATCH movies on the N7, I'd say get that.  It has the best reading display of the three, and not being locked in to Amazon is a huge benefit.  If all you care about is consuming Amazon content and that purple hell-glow is OK with you, then get the HDX.  It's the smallest of the devices, with a slightly larger screen than the N7 (not as big as the iPad though) with good sound.  If Amazon ever gets it's head out of the sand, stops trying to convince everyone that the screen is actually OK, really it is, and FIXES IT, I will buy it again just for reading and movies.

Amazon generally has been painless in this matter, but I was surprised at the insistence of the account representative to send me a replacement.

Today I received a refurbished one and when I called to tell them it was unacceptable, I was told because I did not purchase it through Amazon they would only send me a refurbished. After only 35 days. This was a gift from my Son for Christmas. This is unacceptable and I wouldn't give this to my worst enemy. I will never purchase another item from Amazon and every chance I get I will let people know how shabby I have been treated. I cannot even take it back to where my Son purchased it because it is after 30 days. So because of 6 six days I should only receive a refurbished kindle.

Stupid fast. (I owe a Nexus 7, this is faster)-Simple interface.-Everything works. No wifi-issues, no screen issue, it works as advertised.-The Mayday feature. It just works. And someone responds in under 30 seconds.-Buying stuff (apps, books, mags) is super easy, and is presented nicely.CONS:-Customization: little to none. Device settings are limited, and while I get the design philosophy of simple, a little too simple for my android-tinted desires to control my device.-Interface, while simple, is non-linear. Can be confusing at times. Like the tabs up top, and then the side tabs go to (sorta) the same place, and then the different media stores within the tabs, and from there... I don't even know, it gets confusing.-Not as many apps as Play Store/iOS App store, not really a complaint more of a wish for more of Play Store's apps.

Seemed a little glitchy at first start up (initial software update) but smooth sailing since then. Bright, colorful, fast, easy to use, etc.I had an Ipad 2 and sold it on craiglist after 10 months. Meh. Big, clunky. You needed 3 hands to use it. I bought each of my kids an Ipad Mini original. Expensive and nothing special. This is small and light and affordable. Completely different product.Various reviews complain how limited the apps are. I mean if 800k apps will guarantee your productivity, more power to you. I keep it to about 50 apps and all are important. Only thing lacking is no Facetime for apple user friends and family but no biggie.I strongly considered the Nexus 7. I have friends who love the original. The shape is just a little off and weird. It was a toss up. Happy about my Kindle choice.My coworkers have gawked at it all day. I wish the LTE option under ATT was cheaper so I would have bought that option but probably wouldn't have really gotten my money's worth.Other than that fancy Apple logo, this is a much smarter bet. Toss up with the Nexus 7 but this shape is better. Can't see why you would regret it.Lastly, I read a little bit with the blue ring glow against the white background (making headlines with the blue glow) but I don't see what the issue is.

The Search is Over, You were with me all the while...", "Author": "Phuong Ha", "ReviewID": "R2JUK2I68311BW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sorry for the cheesy Survivor reference. But the search is really over. After weeks of reading, waiting and wanting, I finally came to a conclusion that not only have allowed me to sleep better but it also has allowed my wife to search better, surf better, and feel better.So, here is the low-down on the research I did prior to finally buying the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" vs. the iPad Mini, Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 7\" or 8\" or 10.1, the Samsung Note 8\" or 10.1, the Nexus 7\", and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9.First the iPad Mini. She has the iPhone and I did before trading for a Samsung Note 3. We have tons and tons of apps bought from iTunes. But, truth be told, the pricing made me crazy. You get old technology for cheaper than the rest (last year's iPad mini) with lower resolution but cheap. But cheap to Apple is almost the same as the other tablets. If you wanted the new A7 chip then you had to pay for it with your first born. I was tired of being brain-washed into the Apple Cult so I opted out from the iPad Mini. Look and feel was okay but you needed to buy too many accessories to make it feel safe and secure and yes, cool. So no to Apple.Second, the Samsung Tab 3 and Note tablets. After switching to the Note 3 phone, I loved the pen and the many options Samsung added to a phone with an awesome screen resolution and size. So it was natural that I looked at the Samsungs as an option. But upon close inspection here's what I found.All are great screen resolutions, look and feel. All have access to the Android App store so that's no problem. In fact, most apps that cost me rent money on iTunes, was free in the Android Store. But, here's the deciding factor: price compared to processor speed. If you wanted a good price, you had to settle with last year's model or a not-so-up-to-date model. This went for the Note tablets as well. So, in order to keep up with the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" or 8.9\" you had only the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 version but that meant over the $500 mark. All the other Samsung models either ran off of the older dual-core processors at 1.5 GHz or you could fork over the money for the faster quad-core 1.9 GHz. So no to Samsung.Then of course there was the newly printed Nexus 7 but again, the processor speed was 1.5 GHz quad-core Snapdragon Adreno 320 GPU. Fast but not the fastest one out there. Liked the feel and look of it but really, why use not put in the best processor and make it outstanding. But, I think it was to keep the price competitive. This was the closes one I would have gotten next to the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" or 8.9\". So no to the Nexus, sorry Google.Finally, it came down to the 7\" and the 8.9\". Considering I was getting for my wife, who has smaller hands, wants a tablet but one that feels snug in her hand without giving up screen size. I decided on the HDX 7\". If I would have gotten this thing for me, then I would have again gone with the Fire HDX 8.9\" because it has the Snapdragon Adreno 330 GPU 2.2 GHZ quad-core meaning that it has the fastest processor out there that will eventually last you the longest when it comes to technology.It basically boils down to the fact that technology now is at the speed of quarterly sells. They have to make products that can be introduced according to marketplace sells and holidays. Each new lineup will have a faster and slimmer look.I decided on the Kindle Fire HDX for 3 main reasons: 1) the processor speed is the fastest one I could find. It will last for awhile. It will keep up with everything we throw at it. 2) Price was a major deciding factor. But it was decided eventually on Cyber Monday when I bounce on it for the extra $50 bucks off at the lower price of $179.00. For what you get relative to the price, no doubt this was a no brainer. 3) the look and feel. The rubber back feels really nice and has a soft yet safe feel to it. You don't feel like it's going to drop out of your hands. When holding it from either landscape or portrait views it still feels nice. It has a nice size edge so your thumbs can still grip the tablet with interfering with any open apps. The speed is super fast and responsive. And with Google Gmail integration, again, a no brainer.Overall, truly an awesome tablet. Sorry for the long review.

I've used others in the past, and I never could get past how slow they operate; however, Kindle Fire HDX is an exception. While I'm not familiar with other operating systems, I will say that Fire OS is very smooth. I will admit there were some bugs while working the device. For instance, I have run into a few occasions where it has crashed and restarted. I have also run into situations where I've had to reinstall apps for them to work properly again. In time, I'm sure they'll fix these issues with updates.With respect to the apps that are available for this tablet, you'll might be disappointed. I'm more of a gamer, so going onto Amazon to find out that some of the apps I wanted aren't available to the Kindle yet. This is rather unfortunate, considering a number of these apps have been out for quite some time already. Basically, Amazon doesn't have the same broad selection you would typically find in the Apple Appstore or Google Play. Though it might be common knowledge, apps from the Appstore or Google Play aren't compatible with the Kindle. On the plus side, Amazon does release a free app each day, so that makes developing your collection easier.I've also tested some of the new features that came with the Fire OS 3.1 upgrade, including second screen and Miracast. Second screen allows you to take movies and TV shows from Amazon, and lets you play your selection wirelessly on a nearby television, assuming you have either a Playstation 3 or 2013 Samsung TVs connected. Bear in mind that second screen is only available to amazon content, nothing from netflix, hulu, or any other online streaming services. Ironically, TV Sideview (Sony's app that allows you to control Sony devices from your tablet, including the PS3) isn't compatible w/ the Kindle either. As a result, you'll have to navigate your system on both your controller and the Kindle, at least until, and this is assuming, TV Sideview becomes available for the Kindle.Miracast is a much better version of Second Screen, as this allows you to wirelessly display what you're doing on your kindle onto a nearby television or media streaming device, as long as it is Miracast compatible and compatible with your Kindle. For those of you who have familiarized yourself with Chromecast, just a heads up: it's not compatible with the Kindle. I ended up using the NETGEAR Push2TV Wireless Display HDMI Adapter - Miracast and WiDi (PTV3000) (link provided below) to test Miracast, and I have to say that if you want to use your Kindle to stream content onto your TV, this is the way to go. It displays in HD, the sound quality is superb, and anything you do on your kindle can be placed on your TV. **Gamers, if you're expecting to play games in this fashion, bear in mind that there is likely going to be lag time between the commands you input into the tablet and the miracast compatible device. This doesn't affect anything other than games, however, as the sound and video output on your TV will be synchronized during use. Thus, if you want responsive controls, I don't recommend miracast for gamers.There was one more update that came with Fire OS 3.1, and that is Goodreads. Unfortunately, I'm not too familiar with it. All I know is that it's an amazon app that allows you to share what you've read, provide recommendations, and look at what your friends and other people are reading. Readers, you'll probably find this resourceful. I know some of my friends love it.Overall, the Kindle has the power and graphics to provide you with a great quality experience; however, the selection of apps do pale in comparison to other devices. While it's not perfect, it still provides the same functions you would find in other tablets (some of which are better). If you have to have all of the latest apps, especially the ones that accompany big games, such as GTA V and Injustice (Which has been added since I 1st wrote this review. Still took them most of this year though.), you'll surely be disappointed.Helpful tip for closing apps on your Kindle Fire HDX:Some of you might not know how to close apps on your Kindle, and a number of pages on the web recommends force stopping apps to close them; however, that could damage the data. Assuming an app doesn't have an option to exit the app, just use the back button on the main screen of the app. If the app doesn't allow you to exit that way, then the developers never developed an exit button for their app. Then you'll have to force stop it to keep it from running in the background and avoid eating up some of that precious CPU usage. Hope that was helpful! It might've been common knowledge, but I would not know, as this is my 1st tablet ever, as mentioned previously.To use miracast for your Kindle Fire HDX and television, I recommend:NETGEAR Push2TV Wireless Display HDMI Adapter - Miracast and WiDi (PTV3000)B00904JILO", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Prime video download a joke", "Author": "Patriot1", "ReviewID": "R3MLJ9YWG0SFQP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I upgraded to the HDX for three reasons.

My first tablet was an iPad 1st gen. I liked it, but it was too restrictive & locked down.

I knew the HDX would be high-quality & well made, Amazon doesn't put out anything, but well made devices.It arrived yesterday, it's a lot smaller than I thought it was going to be, but the difference is the HDX doesn't have all the wasted space usually found in the bezel areas of most tablets, it's minimalistic in design. Very much a welcomed change!By reducing the wasted bezel space, Amazon has not only made the tablet lighter, it's very easy to hold in one hand.The true full 1080p HD display has blown me away!!! I have never seen such clarity, vivid full spectrum extremely accurate color reproduction, flawless crisp clean & incredibly smooth video. Honestly, no matter what I say, this is one of those things you have too see to fully appreciate. There is no blurry, pixelated motion distortion you find in some HD TV's.Combined with true Dolby sound, which somehow manages too reproduce a very life like surround sound experience.

It's fast, very user friendly, gorgeous graphics & integrates very smoothly with the content available from Amazon Prime.

Apple & Google have serious competition this time around.Don't second guess yourself if you are considering the HDX, it's an absolute no regret purchase. You will absolutely love the HDX. And YES, the HDX really does have the best & highest quality HD display currently available.After seeing what the Snapdragon 800 CPU & Adreno 330 GPU are capable of, I now see why Google is using both in the upcoming Nexus 5.

The screen is exquisite, far better than my cherished iPad Mini, the sharpness and color are really something!  There is also something about the touch that seems incredibly sensitive --  it seems to respond instantly to the slightest touch.The Kindle Fire HDX is also very light and easy to hold. The feel of the tablet is much softer -- I got blisters after a long day reading with the original Kindle Fire (which was and is a cool tablet -- a superb deal at the moment).This new Kindle was terrific from its first moment out of the (well designed) box.  The quality of the display is so outstanding and the instant response is magic.  This is really something special!A further update:After using the Kindle a few more days, I am even more impressed with it.  The text on the display is wonderfully crisp and clear --  this is the best screen of any tablet that I have owned, including the Retina Display iPad 3., which is superb. I run a number of apps including Twitter and the New York Times, which all work beautifully.I also had the occasion to use the SOS service to answer a question arising from owning too many devices. The response was nearly instantaneous and resolved the question with great dispatch.  This is the best help service I've ever experienced.This is a gem of a tablet!

It arrived a day ahead of time and there were no issues with the packaging or turning it on for initial boot up. After using it daily for 4-days I have encountered some issues with the device. I will describe them in the pro's and con's below.Pro'sThe screen is gorgeous. Movies, print, and pictures are very impressive.Speakers are impressive, a near surround sound experience when watching movies.Easy to consume Amazon products.Con'sApps, their are not many apps available.Apps locked up several times requiring a complete reboot of the device.Kindle Free Time has a very limited selection and does not feel justified for the price.Regarding applications failure. I loaded several language learning applications from the app store, Babbel, Duolingo, Learn French Deluxe, and Busuu. They ALL eventually locked up and required a reboot. The device appeared to completely lock up and I held the power button down for quite some time.ConclusionThe Kindle Fire HDX 7\", HDX Display, Wi-Fi, 16 GB is a great device if you plan to only consume Amazon products. It has some room to mature here, such as more intuitive searching for products on amazon.com. But I would grant this device a 4-5 stars for that experience.Regarding apps, it was only a 2 star rating. Smart devices are all about consuming any type of content on demand. With the several different apps failing the Kindle Fire HDX 7\", HDX Display, Wi-Fi, 16 GB is not yet there. App developers for Android are pushing out the latest version while Amazon stays far behind and v3. Amazon should keep it simple and leverage what the majority are doing. It would make Amazon devs, and external devs, lives easier. It would also improve the customers experience.", "Date": "November 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great 7\" tablet that has great display and speed for your daily uses.", "Author": "AmazonUser", "ReviewID": "R20ZZMML3UW3HI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I will give a short outline of the Kindle's major features.SILK:The Silk browser is a simple and speedy web browser, thanks to the HDX's dual-band, dual-antenna WiFi. No unnecessary features attached to the browser. Just bookmarks, HD video, and fast surfing.Videos/Audio/Apps:The Kindle Fire HDX has a Dolby Digital Plus audio engine which allows for the device to separate the background noises from the person speaking or the music. At full volume, I find this hard. But, with the speaker placement on the top of the device, sound is very clear and loud, even with a case. And with a 1920x1280 resolution at 323 pixels per inch, this is right below the Apple iPad Mini 2 at 324 ppi. But, chances are you will not even notice it. Graphics are amazing for games like Asphalt 8. Downloads for videos and movies do not take an hour, unlike my iPod Touch 4. Yes, the Amazon store may be small, but it has its share of cool apps, including Skype built in (on the Cloud; I'm getting there)Amazon Cloud:Ah yes, the Amazon Cloud. Lets say you bought a load of books on your Kindle Paperwhite. Already on your Kindle Fire. You just have to click on \"Books\", download it (which takes a small amount of time) and there: you got your book onto your Kindle Fire HDX.Same for apps and all that stuff. When you get on your Kindle, you already have Skype, Yelp, iMBD and the Oxford Dictionary. Just have to download and you have Skype on your HDX. You have free, automatic and unlimited cloud storage. iCloud can only claim free cloud storage of up to 5 GB. There is also Amazon Cloud Player, which means you get to listen to your Amazon music on your computer.Special Offers:Not disturbing but helpful. I find myself using these for app deals and videos on Prime and stuff like that. Yeah. It is not intrusive or boring mostly. But it is something I would NOT spend money to remove.Home Screen Layout:With the carousel and the drag down screen thingy, I find it helpful for display but not much else. I like the organization at the top with categories such as \"Books\", \"Apps\", and \"Games\".Customer Service:I like the immediate protection of May day but have not used it. The service on Amazon.com is very helpful in fixing my Kindle Fire. By the way, if your kindle ever gets frozen, just hold the power button for 20s and the Kindle automatically turns off. No important info is lost.Reported Problems:The blue haze \"problem\" is present, but it does not affect me at all in a bad way. When I see it, I find it hilarious and just keep playing/watching. For all the people hating it, DEAL WITH IT.Buttons are on the side, but you just have to feel around for them.Charging is slow with the USB, so Amazon recommends the PowerFast charger.Apps crash a lot: Watch out. Just a minor problem.I RECOMMEND THE FOLLOWING: Buy the 32 or 64 GB version (5.32 GB is used by the device already) with WiFi- adding 4G LTE is +$100 to the price and Special Offers included.

The mayday button is unbelievable and the techs are very friendly. Coming from an all Apple ecosystem I was very worried about how long it would take me to learn the Kindle ecosystem but it literally only took a few hours of playing with it and about 3 mayday calls and now I'm good to go.I hope that the app store becomes better with more selections. I still have about 15 apps on my Iphone 5s that I would really love to have on my HDX but are not available on the Kindle app store. Also the same apps that I have on my Iphone 5s and on my HDX 7\" not all work the same, some features are missing. I would also like to be able to customize my HDX like I do my Apple products, backgrounds, wallpapers, ect.The Amazon cloud and the Iphone cloud app are amazing for syncing photos and documents from my mac and Iphone to my HDX the only problem I am having is syncing my contacts and calendars from my mac and Iphone to my HDX. I have not been able to do so or find an easy way to do it that would always sync without having to manually input one at a time. The emails all sync without any problems (@mac, @comcast, & @gmail) but I still have to get use to the Kindle email and play with it some more before I'm really comfortable.The Amazon Prime membership is the way to go, I actually cancelled my Netflix and saved $100.00 a year. They have a great selection of movies and TV shows and if you want to watch something new its very reasonably priced. You can also borrow books and get 2nd day shipping.Overall I give the HDX 2 thumbs up and will keep it. I will definitely keep my Iphone and Mac's but when it comes to tablets I am confident to say that Kindle is the way to go. The few things that I don't have or can't do on my Kindle are things I can live with and I always have my Iphone and mac and will be able to do them. I finally got my 1st tablet, one that is just as good as an IPad and I can really afford. I purchased the Kindle HDX 7\" with a case, a 2yr complete warranty, and a pack of 3 stylus pens and my total bill with tax was 50% less than the Ipad Mini I wanted with no accessories.Update on Nov. 18, 2013.I finally found a way to sync my Ical from my mac and Iphone to my Kindle HDX. The only way is to first sync your Ical with Google calendar and then once you enter your Gmail account into your HDX it will all sync as long as you continue to update using Google calendar.

Her iPad was just too big and heavy to carry around.  The picture and video clarity is awesome.  And, even though it won't accept Flash, Amazon has their own experimental streaming player that works pretty well with our cable service, so she can receive streaming movies and tv-shows.  As an e-reader, the print is crystal clear, and the \"pages\" are nice and bright, which is a major improvement over the original \"newsprint\" looking Kindles.  The built-in automatic battery-saving feature, when using the e-reader feature, is also a plus.  The main disappointing feature is the camera.  I guess I assumed it would be like the camera on the iPads, but it isn't.  There isn't a lens on both sides.  While the Kindle HDX does take pictures and videos, you have to turn the screen away from you to do so...which makes things a little difficult.  It appears that the primary reason for the camera is for using Skype.  Also, one thing that would have been helpful is for a PDF version of a FULL instruction manual to be downloaded right on the Kindle desktop.  As it is now, you have to go online and read through a list topics to try and find answers to questions....or use the Mayday Button.  There is a PDF manual online, but it is only a Quick Start manual.

I got it on special for $154 and at that price it's a freaking bargain.  I am a  longtime Ipad user (Ipad 2 and more recently Ipad Air) but I was looking for something more portable I could take on my subway ride to work and I didn't want to drop $400 for an Ipad Mini.  What really sold me on the HDX was that I could download free content from Prime and then watch that on the train and I would be able to use the device as a very portable reader.  I was expecting a significant downgrade from my Ipad Air in performance but have found myself blown away by:1. Feel:  The device is light, well built and has good tactile feel with a grippy, rubber like backing.  I bought a case (10 bucks) which was fine but I really liked holding the device without protection so I ditched it.2. Picture:  The picture quality for videos is amazing, far surpassing the Ipad Air's (or any other display I've seen):  I downloaded and watched (for free) an episode of Justified and was noticing slight blemishes and beads of sweat on people's faces.  The images are simply beautiful.3.  Performance:  The HDX is snappy with no lag whatsoever and very intuitive functionality. I was even able to side load a nook app and other Google Play apps in a matter of minutes following easy instructions on line.4.  Browser:  Silk is very quick and easy to use and works like Chrome (which can also be sideloaded but I prefer Silk)5. Customer Support: The Mayday function is revolutionary.  I have never waited more than 30 seconds for help and every rep has been friendly and competent (and native English speakers).  They have walked me through the necessary steps, drawing and highlighting on my unit, and even provided additional tips and suggestions.  Like others I had some issues with dropped WI-FI signals but the Mayday rep downloaded a WI-FI manager for me that maximizes the signal strength from my router and I haven't had a dropped signal since then, about a week ago.  One Mayday rep I spoke to said they spend a lot of time helping folks with basic non-HDX-specific functions on third party apps like Facebook or email like posting pictures or attaching documents.  The Mayday reps are also Amazon generalists and can handle customer service issues as well.6. Cloud storage: This was something I wasn't even aware of when I purchased the unit but copying photos from my Mac and music from Itunes into the Amazon cloud and onto the device was easy and free (2GB for photos and 250 songs).  I also have all my Nook books on the unit which I didn't know was something I could do.In summary I am very impressed with my HDX.  It's a very capable, inexpensive little device.  It won't replace my Ipad use at home but it's perfect for commuting and travelling places where I don't want to carry a larger device.  I have since purchased one for my mom for Mother's Day.  I originally purchased the Fire for her but the Mayday button would be so helpful for her, particularly with everyday functions like how to use Facebook, that I returned the Fire and upgraded to HDX.In brief response to comments from some of the the other reviewers: it is true that the universe of available apps is smaller than on Google Play or Itunes.  That's not really Amazon's fault and most Google Play apps can be side loaded with third-party software. The critical apps are all there.  Also, as other reviewers have noted, the HDX can drop WI-FI signals.  As discussed above, Amazon is aware of the issue and, according to the Mayday rep I spoke with, is working on a fix to be released with the next software update.  In the meantime, the third-party WiFi manager the rep downloaded onto my unit has worked perfectly.", "Date": "May 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Dissapointing technical support", "Author": "Larry Sassaman", "ReviewID": "R2I5UIE6Y91PM2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased the HDX in early Dec. 2013 and until last week was very pleased with the Kindle's performance.

I wanted to experience Android - and this Kindle is Android with Amazon's \"skin\" on top.  I considered a Nexus 7, but customer feedback worried me about it being possibly too fragile.  Price on the Kindle HDX was hard to beat - and the features -screen, and CPU and memory are front-line.What prompted me to write a review?  I bought the Kindle 16GB, WIFI only version- and have been using it about 4 weeks. Tonight I set my 4G iPhone up as a Personal Hotspot - and hooked up my Kindle to the Internet, using the Apple iPhone's WIFI broadcast.  Speedtest showed the Kindle at 5.79 Mbps download, and 10.57 Mbps upload -I was very surprised at the speed it achieved and that upload measured faster down download!Tonight, I also started Pandora, and synced the Kindle to a little bluetooth wireless speaker, and got some great sound.  The Kindle's internal speakers are good on their own (and 2x better than the Nexus 7 if you listen to them side-by-side).  I've found all of the apps I've wanted (Evernote, myfitnesspal, flipboard, feedly, skydrive, zillow, lastpass, and others in the Amazon store -I also sideloaded a couple of apps, a virus checker and maybe 3 or 4 other apps - can't remember which ones right now).  Tried Google Chrome on the Kindle, and I find that it really isn't any more stable (in my experience) than is Silk.  Synced all of my e-mail contacts in from Google to my Kindle Contacts app, and also synced all of my Google calendar entries (from Google/iOS) to a Kindle app called CalenGoo - which seem to be working to keep everything in sync both ways.  Photos I take with my iPhone are synced into the Kindle and can be viewed or edited, and they even show up in a subdirectory on my PC in the Amazon Cloud Drive. Music uploads into the Amazon Cloud have been difficult - only 1 music directory (artist) at a time (from iTunes) - something I haven't finished struggling with.  I agree there is a very faint, light blue border (mainly on the left and right side) on white pages.  If you look you see it, but it is barely noticeable, and to me at least, not the least bit distracting.  I just don't ever notice it to the extent that I remember it  - I just don't \"see\" it unless I go look for it. Its not a defect, just part of the screen illumination design.This review has been all over the place - but I just wanted to give people a hint of what is possible (and there is a lot more I'm sure). I've had a few small glitches  Sometimes the browser (either Silk or Chrome - seems too sensitive and wants to open any sidebar advertisement that I happen to slightly touch.

The Ipad requires an Apple PW EVERY time you want to download an app, and you have to make sure you remember it EXACTLY, because if you don't, the system won't let you in, and there's no way to store your password so it will fill in automatically.

I really had a hard time choosing between Kindle and ipad. I knew I was getting all 3 kids a kindle fire for Christmas (a different review coming for those), but for myself, the decision was tough since I already have an iphone and feel like an ipad is just a bigger version of the iphone but it's not a phone - so part of me thought \"whats the point?\". I wanted a device to-go and mostly for entertainment and books. I have a laptop and it's not fun to lug around when really I just want something to maybe do a little work email and gaming or read on. I also travel frequently and think I can get buy with just a tablet. The Kindle was my first. The results on it are:Music/Media:ipad would streamline all our content with my phone and itunes. If I went the ipad way I feel like we could just kinda have one system and get apple TV to rent movies on. And guess what?! KINDLE does it even better! I paid the 25.00 or whatever it was to upload ALL our 11,000 songs to the cloud and the kids and I can all listen from the cloud or download to our devices. Now I will be researching a device to stream to TV.Speed:Some games lag on this device, but I am still new to it so I am unsure if it's the device or processor, or if it's the game itself. Overall though, the selection of games has been great and free or cheapBooks:You can't go wrong with Kindle books. They are generally MUCH cheaper than apple's books, and sometimes even free! I like the screen and the ease of turning \"pages\", etc. I am still learning about some of the highlighting features, and X-ray is really cool! I just figured that out tonight thanks to MAYDAY!Another great thing! MAYDAY!I have used it twice. I was wondering if they could see me but they cant - even though I can see them. You get a PERSON in AMERICA when you hit the mayday button, and it literally takes less than 10 seconds to connect to them. It really made me think I have to get one of these for my gramma. Really useful. No googling forever, no making an appointment at the genius bar 3 weeks in advance just to ask a simple question. Just hit mayday, reach a human, and ask! And while they answer you they are friendly and may offer up info about other features you didn't know the device had.Sound:I was surprised how good the sound is! Ususally small devices have a bit too much treble or tweet or something for me. This one has even sound. You can comfortably listen to music or something on it without feeling like you need to go get the bluetooth radio. (and it has bluetooth too!) Also sounds great with Beats headphones, but what doesn't?Screen:Is fantastic. Video quality is wonderful!Battery life:Pretty fair. Doesn't last all day if it's in constant use but doesn't take too long to charge either.Now the cons:*No way to track it if it's lost like you can in the icloud, though you can call amazon and they can essentially make it into a brick for whoever finds it. I would just like to see GPS tracking so you know where you left it. Or a way to make it chime somewhere if I can't find it in the house.*Plug is kind of angled and funky, so hard to plug it into the charger in the dark. Have to angle it just right.*NO REAR CAMERA - You can only take front facing \"selfies\" with it.*Not easy to quickly \"kill\" apps if you need to. Have to get through a menu to get to them and do it.Overall, I am VERY happy with it, even as a faithful iphone user.

Cordoba \"mxc\"", "ReviewID": "R3M0JZDWPQSSDE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I really wanted to like the kindle. It has a great price, awesome screen, and with an advertised 11 hour battery life (up to 17 hour if just reading according to Amazon) I figured this device was the perfect companion.After a few weeks of testing and timing, I can confidently say that for the vast majority of user scenarios, the battery life is significantly worse. In fact, I have no idea how exactly Amazon came up with the 11 hour number.But lets start with the basics pros:- Screen is really nice (yes there is some slight blue light bleed around the edges, but Amazon has a complete explanation of why that is - and it's used to have the great color accuracy/gamut that the display has). Honestly, it was very little to bother me at all, and welcome the increase color gamut. The screen is superb.- Kindle Free Time: this is absolutely great. I can let my daughter play with the kindle with some serious restrictions. (what apps can be accessed, how long she can play, read or watch videos (3 distinct timers). She can't do purchases or anything else. I can't believe nobody had done something like this before. It's really amazing.Cons- Neutered android means that a lot of very popular android apps are not available, and you have to resort to side loading them, and not all work that well. I really wish they allowed a larger percentage of the Google Play store apps (all preferred)- thick border around the edges, where the display could be extended to be even more usable without increasing the size of the device. It's around a 1.5 inch diagonal of wasted space. The iPad min in contrast his just a 1/4 of an inch or so.- And the worst offender which causes this to be a 2 star product instead of 4 stars, is the misrepresented battery life. Partner has an iPad2, (10 hour claim) and it generally lives to those expectations, lasts all day off the plug, great.The Real Battery Life of the HDX which claims to be 11 hours (up to 17 reading!!) is closer to 5 hours.Here are the tests I did during the last 3 weeks:The first day, I downloaded several apps and got it setup, read some books to my daughter, and watched a movie. I used the mayday button to ask about sorting apps by age of your child (can't be done as of now). It couldn't have been more than 4 hours, and the device was already at 10% charge (down from a full 100% charge) so I was really disappointed, and started doing a series of tests:Things to note:* Wifi only model (3g would suck the battery even more)* brightness was set to 50%.* I'm a huge fan of Amazon, and this is the first Amazon product that has really let me down with their claims. I owned a kindle keyboard, and now a paperwhite 2 - both of which I love. Customer service has always been second to none. Basically, there is no reason for me to \"bash\" this product. I am a tech person, and I am aware battery life varies quite a bit by usage, but this is a serious issue not just a small variation. Amazon failed to deliver big time on their battery life promise.Test 1:* 3 hours of mostly reading (kids books, so they had colors and things, my daughter flipping through the pages)* 1 hour of videos (she was unfortunately drawn to Barney)* Half hour of games (some simple puzzle games, nothing 3D intensive or anything requiring full use of the graphic processor)* Battery was down to 20% and I started surfing the web and others until it ran down in 1.75 hours.So basically, during a reading heavy session (17 hour amazon claim), the device failed to last 6 hours.Test 2:- Charged it overnight, let my daughter do whatever she wanted with it (using the awesome Kindle Free Time). She mostly watched videos and flipped through some books. She also opened a game or two (Again simple puzzle games, no 3D battery intensive games). She had breakfast in between and then lunch. And then brought the device to me because the battery was dead. The device lasted just over 4 hours...In contrast the iPad, where she likes to play with 3D puzzles and several other 3D apps (Mr Potato), she plays with it several days before it ever runs down.  I can confidently say that playing with apps, the iPad lasts at least twice as long as the kindle fire.Test 3:- Sporadic use throughout he day. I figure I'd try a really subtle scenario.- Light web browsing (not more than 30 minutes)- Some videos (1.5 hours)- occasional book (only 5 minute spans, or flipping through pictures)- The device was on the sleep state most of the time.- Battery life was at 30% that night. So 70% of the battery was lost during some 3 maybe 4 hours of use.I will do a strictly video test and post it later.But nothing I have seen indicates that any normal usage will get you anywhere near the 11 hour claim.", "Date": "December 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love It", "Author": "P.

I wish I would have purchase more space but 16gb works if I delete shows as I finish I believe I fit 10 to 12 shows at a time.The blue does not bother me which was my concern. The kindle reading to me is great I use it on my drives home from work and sometimes at the office. I was never an audio book fan but I like this option without spending audiobook money.The ads only come up on the lock screen and usually for free or cheap stuff so that is great. I got a $3 music credit o. One of the ads which is nice.I have not read in the sun yet but the sun in my corner office has not effected my reading or show watching during lunch hour.Battery life has been great!This was my birthday gift and I am so happy.

They have offered to send me some older model refurbished kindle in exchange for about a $100 fee. (Older Model) keep in mind. Apparently Amazon (Kindle) department only offers a warranty on inner parts in such cases something mechanical goes wrong. (No Screen Protection).Do your homework before selecting this product. I believe some places like Samsung Galaxy have a screen protection program they do. Amazon really should offer a better broken screen replacement program or at least let people send them in to get the screen replaced on theirs at a low price vs having to replace it at $149 just so they can turn around and resell yours at a $129 profit.Kinda sad program they have currently.Anyway..................I would suggest looking into other that are much more durable.

The original Kindle fire worked great and did what we wanted. While we have all the \"i\" devices from Apple, the footprint of the kindle was easier to deal with and overall it was a great product.The two HDX however have caused me nothing but frustration. One has FreeTime for my 6 year old, and the other doesn't. Let me go down some of the issues that have annoyed me greatly:#1 - The Kindle for my daughter has issues with staying connected to WiFi. It will drop connection and go into a constant state of searching for an access point. There are a total of 6 access points in my house, overkill yes, but I'm an IT guy... just goes with the territory. Going Airplane mode, Turning on & off WiFi, etc does not work. Only a full powercycle fixes the issue.#2 - FreeTime REQUIRES a password, and the only way to get to some of the kids apps is going into FreeTime. I trust my child, she is very mature for her age, she doesn't NEED a password MANDATED by Amazon. This is simply an annoyance and should be the choice of the parent.#3 - The Kindle with FreeTime also WILL NOT allow applications to be used when outside of WiFi range. It gives an Internal Service Error when trying any application in or out of FreeTime. I've researched the forums and this is a known issue which has not been adequately addressed by Amazon. I have tried every one of the suggestions, flushing the cache on the AppStore service (and one other, can't remember the name), deregistering & reregistering, reloading completely. I'm not sure what they have done to tie every app access to the app store, but this is a huge flaw and only seems to happen on Kindles with FreeTime installed (per review on the forums).#4 - Total Lockout of Google Store/Google Framework - Due to the 'pissing contest' between Amazon and Google, no Google apps can be installed. While the email app will pull your mail from GMail, you cannot load the actual GMail app, Google Maps, YouTube App, etc. You can force a sideload of an app, but it will be massively hindered because the Google Framework cannot be installed.#5 - Relating to number #4 - NO native YouTube app. My children watch a great deal of YouTube because they love MineCraft. However, because YouTube is a Google product now, they don't play nicely together. I've seen several times responses on the forums from Amazon folks saying to load one of the three third party apps which supports YouTube. Two of these are limited to only their selection of videos and have forced ads which my children don't need, and the third which actually allows access to searching (in a horrible non intuitive way) immediately started throwing up ads for ADULT WEBSITES. Great for the kids, eh?#6 - Also relating to #4, lack of access to the VAST number of Android applications which are available due to lockouts. While you can sideload after unlocking one of the settings, it still reduces the effectiveness of the applications due to their tinkering with parts of Android that truly don't need to be tinkered with.#7 - The 'Carousel' (the gigantic scrollable icons on the screen) is nothing but a history of past applications used. There is no way to keep your favorites in place, there is no EASY way to clear it. If the device was mine I would hate it as a privacy issue. Overall it forces you to use the text menus at the top more than anything else, or the search function to find applications you want to use. I personally just hate the interface.We debated long and hard between going with the mini-iPads, Kindle Fire HDX, or the various Android pads. Now that I have all of these for review, I would lean heavily towards something like my Samsung Galaxy Tab or other pure android device of quality. There are simply too many headaches totally caused by the effort to make this device proprietary and denying applications made by the developer of the OS, Google. Overall I've highly disappointed, this could have been a great product.For the Positives : Great screen, great size, better price than apple products.Once again, love Amazon as a whole... but I've tried to make these work for my family and yet my children run and get their 2 year old iPods which have tiny screens just to avoid using these.", "Date": "May 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Definitely exceeded expectations.", "Author": "Frank L.

Can't speak to charging complaints because I keep a charging cord next to my bed and two more around the apt and I plug my phone in every night and my Kindle every morning when I awake. After 2 weeks, in one day my Kindle HDX has never been below 40% and average end of day is about 65% so I've never had one day of usage as an inconvenience.

Kindle fire uses a modified version of google's android and limits you to Amazon's appstore which is mostly a watered down version of google's play store. I would consider this a con but there are some distinct benefits of the amazon app store. The first benefit is that amazon provides you the ability to use their amazon prime streaming service along with the major apps such as netflix, plex, ETC.Kindle Fire hardware- The kindle fire has top of the line hardware for a budget tablet. The quad core snapdragon 800 has great graphics capability along with great multitasking capability. The HDX technically has a better CPU than the 2013 nexus 7 and a much better CPU than the galaxy series. The screen has great colors and decent brightness with pretty decent viewing angles.Kindle fire battery life- I believe that the kindle fire battery life is subpar when compared to my nexus 7 and my wife's ipad mini. I typically get about 6-7 hours of streaming video whereas I get about 10 hours with my nexus 7 and about 11 with the ipad mini.Kindle fire durability-  The kindle fire is the only tablet that I've ever had a cracked screen with. The screen cracked just towards the edge because I stepped on it. I don't know if this is because I'm a fat bastard or because the screen is abnormally weak. I believe it was a combination of my fat bastard qualities as well as the thinner screen. I have dropped my other tablets and I have stepped on my nexus 7 and slatebook before and they haven't broken yet.Value- No doubt the HDX has great value. The hardware and software are top notch.Which should I choose- If you are a big google supporter then I would recommend a nexus 7 or a samsung tablet. If you are strictly using it for media such as netflix and amazon prime, no doubt you should choose the kindle fire HDX.all in all the tablet is great but there are some limitations which may or may not be the deal breaker. The reason I bought it was to use amazon prime instant streaming so that I didn't have to download flash on my nexus 7.", "Date": "April 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love this tablet!", "Author": "Macy Banton", "ReviewID": "R2UUCOOFX42R5P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First I should say that I have very limited experience with tablets. Having received an HP Slate (Microsoft based tablet) at work, which I was allowed to keep when they replaced the HP's with Apple iPads (which I used for about a year).I wasn't even in the market for a tablet, but I had purchased a mobile hotspot plan through my wireless carrier (the hotspot was free with a 2 year contract) and was offered $100 off any tablet as a promotion for purchasing the hotspot plan.I chose the Kindle Fire HDX 7 and am certainly glad I did. The Kindle performs flawlessly. It has a great picture - perfect for watching MLB TV games, offers a number of fantastic apps. (I especially enjoy my talking Bible, as well as many Bible trivia/quiz apps, and Hangman).I love the Kindle library choices and also love the fact that my Kindle can read my books to me. The Kindle HDX 7 also features excellent sound, so much so that I have yet had to use my external speaker.I find the HBX 7 the perfect size for carrying around - it is light, compact, and the controls are very intuative. The only thing I was disappointed about is that the Speaktoit Assistant app is not (yet?) available for the Kindle Fire HDX. I have this app on my smartphone and find it very useful.I have on occassion used the MayDay button, and found the customer service reps. & tech support people very helpful.I should mention that my wife has the previous generation Kindle Fire HD 7 which has also performed flawlessly, and my daughter has a Google Nexus 7\" tablet by Asus - which is also a fine tablet, however IMO not quite as well thought-out as the Kindles are. In fact for my needs I prefer the Kindle HDX Fire over the i-Pad, it's that good.I originally was going to use a case with a keyboard for my Kindle, but found that the touch keyboard performs flawlessly & there is no need for an external keyboard. (In comparison the touchpad keyboard on my HP Slate does not perform anywhere near as well as the Kindle's), and with the HP, I use a small external keyboard.I've owned my Kindle Fire HDX 7 for 4 months now and find it does everything I would expect it to do and more. I am surprised at how quick this little dynamo is. Kudos to Amazon for making such a wonderful little tablet. I should also mention that it has excellent battery life compared to the other tablets I have owner and/or used.I'm a completely satisfied customer, and keep Bibles and Bible Handbooks as well as a few other books in my Kindle library, and find it wonderful to be able to store all of  these on such a small tablet.

I've had the kindle fire HD for almost a year so I'm used to the buttons being in a set place so if you're upgrading that's something to keep in mind.-Charger and headphone ports are slightly slanted so when plugged in the cords jut out in a strange way-The infamous purple/blue light (I personally don't mind it since everything else is so gorgeous but you definitely do notice it while reading so I'm including it in cons I guess as a warning to others)-I preferred the curves on the back, if it ain't broke why fix it? BUT if you've never used a kindle fire HD you won't miss it at all so this isn't really a con per se.Amazon has outdone itself in my opinion. I was a big fan of the Kindle HD (which I had for 8 months) and used it constantly. I prefer Kindle greatly to my iPhone and Kindle tablets may be the reason I switch to an android phone because of how preferable I find it. The ease of use in transferring books and music is unbeatable. Drag and drop and be done with it! And though Amazon tries to push itself on you (no google market on the kindle, amazon cloud, ect) they never do anything as annoying as apple with iTunes. Kindle marries together the simplicity and straight forwardness of using an iPhone (EVERYBODY knows how to use one of those) with the customization and ease of an android. Beginners and pros alike can find something to enjoy on the Kindle HDX.And what's better is everything that people mentioned they didn't like in their reviews of the Kindle HD, Amazon fixed with this tablet. They learned their lesson and included the charger adapter, they made HD content more accessible and better quality, and upped the ante with two more processors with those who felt the Kindle couldn't keep up with their content. They even upgraded Silk to be a better browser! This is basically unprecedented with physical stores because they don't have a consistent reviewing system where the consumer literally says what they liked and don't like. It's great to know Amazon is listening.I'm very satisfied with this purchase (bought from Radioshack, not amazon so it would be here on time for Christmas) and will continue to buy Amazon's tablets whenever they come out and it's time to upgrade. I may update the review as time goes on because I DID just get the kindle for Christmas, but I've been a big fan of Amazon and Amazon Kindle tablets for years now.Edit 1: I've had the kindle for a few weeks now and I still adore it, but the buttons are quickly becoming a big hassle. I don't have 50 dollars to kick out for the official cases but because of the sudden change of the buttons locations finding different cases is extremely hard unless you search through amazon itself. For those who like ordering from amazon this is not really an issue, but those who would like to find a bargain without paying shipping on a case this is a downside.I was split on the button at first because I understand they wanted to change where the buttons are but because of the fact that I can never remember where the power button is and the case issue that's definitely a con.", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wow, the screen and sound are amazing", "Author": "Mema \"Wife, Mother, Mema, Sister\"", "ReviewID": "R3AR2BBRDJ0499", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I generally read on my Kindle and this HDX is great for reading, yes there is a hint of purple around the edges but frankly once I start reading I don't even notice it, probably would never have noticed it but for other reviews.

All of them love their tablets so that is the biggest ranking for this feedback.  We have used mayday and had fast and convenient service even on Christmas morning.  Overall these are excellent tablets, however, there are some drawbacks for parents:- You can not add passwords to each child's profile.  (If you have multiple children, they can easily prank each other by modifying or deleting content from another child's profile so be prepared for drama.)- The child or parent must enter the parental controls password every single time they exit from freetime. If you envision them being able to use freetime, but also to be able to exit freetime to use skype, youtube, the camera, or any other features outside of freetime app, this is a BIG PROBLEM.  The password they have to enter to exit freetime is the same parental controls password that prevents them from making purchases. Making the parental controls useless if you want your child to be able to use the tablet outside of freetime.-  There is no way to set up your children on your amazon account without them also having full access to all of your amazon account information, order history, and all of your other Amazon content.  You can get around this by setting up a separate email and amazon account just for children's kindles. but it is a hassle which still requires a credit card, or prepaid visa credit card if you anticipate using any apps.-  Very popular apps are not always available on kindle and this can cause big drama.  Two of our children got Furby Booms and expected to be able to use the Furby Boom App on their Kindle Fire HDX 7s.  The Furby Boom App is NOT available for Kindle Fire HDX.

Although I enjoy and appreciate such things as HAM radio, smart phone, laptop computer, and all Kindles starting with the original e-reader to now the Fire HDX; I am self taught so there will be no sophisticated analysis here. Two years ago I bought the first Kindle Fire and have enjoyed using it however after reading the many reviews over the past year about the Kindle Fire HDX I decided to upgrade.Primarily I use my Kindle for email, listening to the radio, reading, and having the ability to listen to music at the same time.The personal docs is another feature I enjoy as I send my favorite recipes to my Kindle and can easily share them or do my grocery shopping for the ingredients without having to make a list.  I like the lighter in weight, sharp screen with brilliant colors, longer life battery, and better sound quality.  The screen does have less glare, but not as good as the e-reader.The original Kindle fire allowed me to download music directly from Amazon but haven't figured out how to do that with the Kindle HDX, also I had the drop box on the Kindle Fire but am not able to download the app on the new Kindle HDX from the cloud.  I take pictures on my smartphone and they go directly to my laptop computer, and Kindle Fire, and of course stay on my phone; a real convenience.  I am able to go on line to dropbox.com and view my pictures that way, just not as convenient.  Despite those two negatives the Kindle Fire HDX rates five stars for quality and price.One more item, I debated whether to buy the 16 GB or 32 GB; I chose the 16 and if I could do over would choose the 32 GB. I don't download movies but I do like a choice of books and music that will take the bulk of my storage ability.

The speakers are good, too--better than I expected.Here are my disappointments:*The purple/blue line along the edges is real.  It is only there when the screen is white (when reading), but there is an option to change your background to another color and that seems to eliminate the line.  But I don't think that line should be there at all.*I cannot put .mobi files on this Kindle even though I have put them on my other Kindles.*I also cannot put my music directly on the Kindle and instead have to upload it to the Cloud and then download to my device.  I have more music than cloud storage, so in order to use my Kindle to listen to it, I have to pay for more storage, even though this music is all in my iTunes.  It also is very time consuming \"uploading\" it to the cloud.  I experienced a lot of frustration trying to figure it all out, too.  The instructions say you can move music directly to the Kindle, but unless you purchased said music from Amazon, it will not allow the transfer.*I REALLY wish there was a handbook with this.  While I am not a computer \"whiz\", I am not that bad, either.  While some things are very easy to me, other things have been challenging.  I would like to option of reading through a handbook instead of having to search endlessly online for an answer.  The Mayday button is a nice idea, but I really hate to use this for simple answers.*The connection for the charger is at a very odd angle and because of that, it is difficult to plug in.*There is no HDMI output on this model.

I set it to charge at 1:30 at 60% and it is at 100% 2 hours later.  I miss the colored on/off button showing the charging (green and orange).  You have to turn the unit on to see how much charging is there.  When I used the camera zooming disturbs the pixels so I am not excited about that but I am not a big picture taker with cell phones or tablets anyway.  Plus the 7\" only has a front camera anyway.One thing that is a gripe is that each time they come out with a new kindle you have to purchase a new cover because they (I think on purpose) reposition things so they do not line up with your present cover.  Keeps the people that make covers in business I suppose.  At least the charger for the old Kindle fits the new Kindle so I have an extra to keep in my suitcase.All in all, I am very pleased.  If the reading charge is close to the 17 hours they advertise (probably closer to 14 if I know Amazon) then I will be happy.  We travel a lot and I wanted more charging for that.  Plus being able to read easier outside was a big deal for me.  I think it is well worth the money.  I love it.I am adding an edit to my original review.  The blue haze, I set my books on the tan (was called sepia in the old kindle) and I adjusted the brightness to about 50% and I don't notice it at all now.  I don't see this blue haze thing as a big problem.  I think if people would give it a few days they would no longer notice it.", "Date": "October 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Product, Great Performance, Great Price", "Author": "Talon Lister", "ReviewID": "R8Y6UYO1AC7WK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I Love my HDX.  I've had it for a tad over 4 months now, and it's awesome.  I love bragging about the Specs, since they are inarguably the best specs available on a tablet of this size, and this price range.  It feels great to know you have the best.  Sometimes, I wish I had the Play Store, but most popular apps are available on Amazon's app store, so most of the time, I don't really miss it.  It's extremely easy to sideload apps that aren't available on the app store anyway. I love the Free App per Day program on the app store, where they offer a different (normally paid) app for free, every single day.  Sometimes it's stuff you won't really use, but every once in a while there are jewels that you can't pass up.  I've only used MayDay a couple of times, but those times I've used it, it's been awesome, and Amazon Customer service never seizes to disappoint me.  The only issue that I've had (and the one that I mistakenly requested a replacement unit for), is that when the battery gets under 30%, the screen tends to flicker just slightly, almost like a CRT screen.  After describing this to a mayday agent (before I realized it only happened on low battery), they kindly sent me through to customer service to get a replacement unit.  After I got the replacement, and it did the same, I figured it was just a normal thing, and didn't bother them again.  This has been my only issue, and it gets put out of your mind after you experience the sheer beauty of the screen and performance of this machine.

I'm writing this on my wife's account, and it's really her Fire, but I'm hearing the input she has and it's nothing but praise.Truthfully, if we didn't have some specific things we do with the tablet, we might have gone with another brand; probably a Nexus 7. It turns out, though, that our needs are very specific and they have a lot to do with doing business with Amazon. Here's our list of deal breaker priorities:1. She wants to simply browse the internet while she's sitting and watching TV. Does the Fire come with the best browser? Probably not, but it comes with a very credible one. I looked into it and found that I could install Chrome if she wanted, but she's very happy with Amazon's silk. No need to change browsers.2.She checks her email using her Fire when we're on the road. I usually hog the laptop so she uses the Fire to check email. I bought the fire having no idea that the newer versions have Bluetooth. I checked the Bluetooth against an old Bluetooth mouse and it seems to work great. Now we're considering buying a Bluetooth keyboard for her to use on the road just to use for returning more detailed emails and maybe some minor editing of some of our writing too. This wasn't on the \"deal breaker\" list, or even on the list at all, but it turns out to be a nice bonus.3. Finally, and this is the primary deal breaker because the above two items could be accomplished by any number of tablets. We have a reasonable investment in digital media purchased from Amazon. We really like the way Amazon has things set up with their Unbox program for PCs and so on. Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't provide a player for their movies and TV shows on iPad or even other other Android tablets. So for viewing movies and TV shows from Amazon, especially off line like we like to do when we're away from the internet, it's either a Microsoft Surface (using Windows 8 and the Amazon Unbox player) or a Fire. The Surface looks promising, but it's kind of expensive when we have such a small and specific list of needs.I've found that Amazon seems to consistently  sell their media for a bit cheaper than most other sources. I like (trust) their cloud storage, and already have a sizable investment in their products. Given all these factors, it was looking like the new 7\" Fire HDX was a good choice.We have an old 1st generation Fire that she was using for all the above. The Silk browser was pretty quirky and pretty slow but sort of worked. In our home in Angel fire, New Mexico, where we have only satellite internet and really slow latency (long ping times), the Fire was almost unusable.The new Fire is like night and day. It's leaps and bounds better than the old one, and the old one was a good buy when we got it. My wife is pleased as punch with the new Fire for our needs, which admittedly are very specific. We believe there's no reason to spend more money for stuff we don't need and we should buy our products tailored to fit our specific needs. Given that we each have Kindle Paperwhite readers, hundreds of books plus lots of TV shows and movies, and that we've never had a bad experience with Amazon, we're comfortable adding another Fire to our inventory of readers. It's just a great fit for us.As for the old Fire, it's now mine. I don't use it for browsing or email, or even for watching movies although it worked pretty good for that. What I do is send documents over to read offline, usually technical reading I get on the internet related to Photoshop, Wordpress, and a few other topics. I then send those pages and documents over to the Fire to read off line. The Fire - even the old one - is a great tablet for reading documents that are read indoors and have color illustrations, like Photoshop tutorials and so on.So for us, it couldn't have been a better choiceDonald Finkhiddenmesa.com", "Date": "December 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "WiFi Connectivity", "Author": "John Oldenkamp", "ReviewID": "R2D4NDXAQYOGTC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To be honest, I do not own this particular unit.

It looks beautiful and has a lot of features I enjoy. The quick menu at the bottom of the screen is great for keeping frequently used apps handy yet keeps the carousel uncluttered. I don't remember being able to set a passcode on the HD, which I've done on the HDX. The Mayday button is worth the Kindle's weight in gold. I was having difficulties getting apps I purchased on my desktop to download to the device. Talking to the techs I was able to deregister the device and reregister and all the apps appeared like magic.The loss of one star is for several reasons. I have noticed buggy issues with connectivity, downloading apps (device or desktop purchases), and connections with the tech during a Mayday call. I made 7 calls to get the app issue mentioned above resolved. it wasn't that the techs didn't know what to do (one had just fixed the problem for someone else so knew exactly what to do), it was that after 2-3 minutes the call would automatically disconnect. I did get very good at summing up the problem in as few words as possible but it was very frustrating to have to do it 7 times. At the end of all the calls it asked if the problem was resolved and I kept clicking no. I later learned that's probably held against the tech and felt horrible because they all were so friendly and helpful for the time I talked to them.Another feature I don't care for is the limited number of recommended items. When you have the focus on an item in the carousel, just below it displays suggested items you may also enjoy. On the HD, the list was 8-10 items and on the HDX it's only 4 with an option to See All. A bit clumsier than the old method.Overall, I would purchase this again and again and, if I could afford it, would buy one for everyone I know to ween them from whatever they're using now. Fix the buggy Mayday calls and the weird downloads and it'll bump back up to 5 stars.UPDATE 1/6/14 - I have changed it from 4 to 5 stars, as promised. It seems with a couple of the software updates (automatically taken care of) the bugs mentioned above concerning the downloads have been resolved.

Touch screen is easy to manipulate and calibrated nicely.  So easy to set up, connect all my accounts, downloading all my books from the cloud and set up only took maybe 5 minutes if that.  Sound is crisp, pretty loud for a small tablet.The Bad: Since only owning Apple products, some of my favorite apps aren't available.  I.E. Had to download a basic app for a calculator.  Screen does have a glare (somewhat expected), does smudge (just like my phone does, also expected).  Wifi issues.  Ill preface by saying I'm honestly not sure exactly where the problem is coming from, I have yet to try mayday to get suggestions.  Things aren't loading properly and I'm having to shut off wifi, restart the kindle, turn the wifi back on for it to work.  I've done this 3x today.  I made sure my phone and other wifi devices were working to double check bandwidth issues.  Seems to be working okay.  This will be a deal breaker for me so hopefully mayday can help me.  Lack of customizing you can do does bug me, Id love to see my sons big smiling face on the wallpaper, that is not possible.  Lack of additional memory options, though I knew about that.Overall I think it's a great product for the money.  It does everything I would like it to do.  Most of the negatives I can live without or deal with.  I'll be contacting amazon soon about the Wifi issue and will update this review.*UPDATE* 10/29/2013Wifi issue was a home issue.

Kids Freetime, as I mentioned before my BIGGEST drawer to the HDX...BUT downloading the same apps as my iphone has (free kid apps), in-app purchasing is still there so when his little finger accidentally clicks an ad or \"buy\" buttons, the kindle buy box still pops up, now with 1-click buying I have noticed he has bought a couple things.

I do notice the blue light on the edges of white pages, but its totally not an issue at all.  I love the smaller size, yet same size screen.  With the case you really notice the difference between the HD and the HDX in its case, weight and size-wise. Also I really like the Mayday feature;  within seconds I was talking to a live human who's fave popped up in a small Window on my screen.  Very cool! !!!I only have two gripes:1)  No microSD card slot.  Still!!! That's a bummer.  PRetty big bummer, but I guess Amazon wants you to store everything in their cloud, or something.  I have the 32gb version and it's barely enough for me, personally.  There's only something like 24gb (or is it 29gb?) left after the OS, and my music alone takes up 20gb.2)  No rear camera!!  Still!!!3)  If you're not going to give us a real camera, I can kind of live with that - though it would be fun to have - but you could at least make the camera on there be sensitive to the fact that you'll be using it for some sort of face-to-face interaction, and we don't like having our nose look huge and our arms aren't long enough to hold the thing far enough away so it doesn't distort our features.  All in all, the camera is pretty much completely useless.CONCLUSION:  Is it worth the upgrade cost?  I, personally, think so.  I love the smaller form factor without losing any screen size; I LOVE the new buttons for volume and power - so much better than the HD - and I love the weight difference and the speed difference.", "Date": "October 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "love and hate relationship", "Author": "Ceper", "ReviewID": "RO3IV31DNMMGB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had the original Kindle fire, 2nd gen kindle fire( the first one had an accident), fire HD and now the HDX.

I thought long and hard about whether to buy an iPad mini and stick with the Apple ecosystem or get another Fire. I'm so glad I went with the Fire. The first thing that struck me was how light the new HDX is. I love the sleek look and the placement of the buttons. The HDX was incredibly easy to set-up. I also had no problem adding my FB photos to the cloud nor uploading my iTunes to the Cloud drive.The screen is absolutely gorgeous. The color and clarity are amazing. I opened a magazine and could read it without expanding the text which I couldn't do with the original Fire. I also found the sound quality excellent. The browser is very fast. I've viewed videos and had no problem with dropped WiFi connections; this was a problem with the Original Fire.While I still prefer my PW for reading, since the HDX is a new toy, I've been reading on it all week and found the reading experience enjoyable. In regard to the blue haze, I'm not sure I would have noticed it if I hadn't read about it. I can see it when I read an ebook and am looking for it.

Finkel \"Jack of Trades\"", "ReviewID": "R2ZF0QJKD88D1M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Update 11/2/2013:  My family has been thoroughly enjoying our Kindle Fire HDX.  We set up Kindle FreeTime and it has been a huge hit with our 3 year old.  We started a free trial of Kindle FreeTime Unlimited that gives her access to thousands of books, games, videos and songs.  Some of these are junk, but many are items we have purchased for other devices in the past or were considering purchasing for the Kindle Fire.  There are Boynton books, Ivy & Bean, episodes of Sesame Street, Dora and Mr. Rogers, as well as Cut the Rope, Monopoly, Life, Bejeweled 2 and other great games.  You can find a list of what is available on Amazon.com (currently over 1500 items).  While the videos are not a big draw if you subscribe to Prime, like we do, Prime members get a discount on the monthly subscription fee, currently $4.99 / child or $9.99 / family.  Prime members only pay $2.99 / child or $6.99 / family.  At $2.99 per month, I feel that Kindle FreeTime Unlimited is, by far, the best feature of the Kindle Fire HDX for us.  If you are a Prime member with children under 10 years old, I would give my strongest recommendation to the Kindle Fire HDX.The Kindle Fire HDX is a great tablet that balances form, function and price.  There are some key differences that set this tablet apart from the iPad Mini 2 and the Nexus 7.  The Nexus 7 has a slower processor.  The iPad Mini 2 has a 7.9\" screen with higher resolution but a much higher price.  The Kindle Fire HDX has no rear camera and the screen has a bluish tint on the edges from the blue LED lighting, but neither bother me.  The Kindle Fire HDX has the least apps available of the three, but all the android apps I like are available.  On the plus side, the Kindle FIre HDX is very user friendly thanks to it's clear and smooth interface and mayday help feature.  If you are an Amazon Prime member or purchase music, ebooks and videos from Amazon then the Kindle Fire HDX is a very seamless way to enjoy your content.My setup consisted of pressing the power button, selecting my language and wifi access point, entering my wifi password and confirming my Amazon account.  It took about 50 seconds.  I was immediately impressed by the screen's resolution, vibrant, accurate colors and wide viewing angles.  The screen automatically adjusts for ambient light, not just with changing brightness but also changing contrast.  Speakers sound good for a tablet, but i wish they weren't rear-facing like every other tablet.  The tablet is incredibly responsive; everything is instantaneous.  Wifi is fast and gets good reception throughout my house without dropping the connection.  The tablet isn't too heavy and feels comfortable thanks to the contoured back with good grip.  I'm not really the kind of person to use the mayday feature, but I see it as being one of the biggest selling points.  Overall, this is a great tablet with a seamlessly enjoyable user experience.", "Date": "October 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "A great media and reading device", "Author": "Kindle Customer", "ReviewID": "R2YZWS556VG4V4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After using an iPad received as a gift a few years ago, I was sold on a multi-use device...I gave my Nook Color to my father and hooked him on ereading!

Something not addressed is the lack of HDMI and the inclusion of Miracast.I like it the HDX. What I don't like that there is no micro- HDMI so I took off 1 star for this. I really liked being able to plug into any screen to watch movies, etc. Now we have Miracast which is unproven and seemingly being forced on us by Amazon. There's not alot of options and if I want my TV's to work I need to buy at least 3 adapters.My question is specific to the Miracast function. Has anyone used a dongle to use the Miracast function? If so what product did you use? Amazon support not to helpful as the Indian call center does not even know the differences between the HD and HDX. I finally got to speak to someone in the U.S. and they sent me to this page http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201370390 where they recommend the Netgear option.Updated 10/25/13I officially miss my micro HDMI. I set up the aforementioned NetGear which does what it says and was the recommended product by Amazon. Good (not excellent) overall picture quality when watching videos, but there is some lag especially when you have to transmit to the Netgear and download simultaneously. This may be better if you took 30 minutes to download a movie 1st, but i have yet to test this. This current hardware spec running through micro HDMI would have been outstanding in my opinion. Miracast is OK, and I'm sure future tech releases will solve latency issues.

Feels really solid and well built. Appstore relative scarcity is not an issue since you can easily sideload APKs if you have them. But...1. When first reading about the purple border \"feature\", I figured it was overblown or exaggerated and wouldn't be an issue. I mean, I have a gen 1 Paperwhite and the faint light blotches seem negligible to me. However, the bluish borders on my HDX are neither subtle nor negligible in size and you can bet I'd be unhappy about them even had I not heard about them first. It is really distracting on anything with a white background. I read at least 10 industry reviews prior to purchase and I didn't see this mentioned once (apparently it was an aside in one review I missed). I have to think this means there is some variance between units and I got a bad one, while the reviewers saw the best examples.2. There's also some non-trivial screen flicker, particularly when I'm in the Settings pages. It's as if it's trying to auto-adjust the brightness, but I have mine set to manual.3. This is minor one, but how can a device whose stated purpose is multimedia consumption not have a graphic equalizer built into the OS?I'll probably wait a bit to see how this all shakes out, but I'm sure I'll be exchanging/returning mine. I'd be completely happy if the screen issues were resolved.***************************************Edit 10/25: Just had an interesting chat with the very courteous Mayday rep \"Cody\". I asked him if the blue haze is supposed to be the same width along all edges of the screen of all Kindle HDX's, and he said yes. I then told him the haze was wider along the long edges of my screen, and he said he's heard that as well (oops). I then asked him if the haze is supposed to be the same width and brightness along each of those long edges (where it's most visible), and he said yes. When I told him that the haze is much wider/brighter along one long edge than the other - the bottom edge opposite the camera, he didn't have a whole lot to say (oops #2), other than this is not considered a defect that warrants a replacement. I then asked him if every HDX exhibits this to the the same degree, and he said, \"they're supposed to\". When I asked him if they actually are all the same, all he would say was to repeat that they're supposed to be.It might sound like I was being a jerk, but it really was just a calm discussion where I wanted those specific questions answered, and there was definitely some waffling on their part. And they are going to replace mine, due to the screen flicker. But if you call with just the haze issue, be prepared to return rather than replace.

I bought the 64GB because I wanted space to download movies and apps because my 3yr old can't stream movies do to our data usage issues. Even though I PURCHASED these movies and DOWNLOADED them to my kindle, my three year old can't watch them now unless I take the kindle to a place that has a stronger internet connection than my cell phone and go into each of the 50 or so movies to 'reset' them because the kindle will start giving her an error message that she needs an internet connection to watch the movies (even though they are downloaded on the kindle!!). Also... even when connected to the internet, I often go into my purchased movies and don't get the option to play the movies. I have to go in and out of the movies a couple times to get the 'play' button to show up. I have also found this unit to be slow and unresponsive.I initially purchased this Kindle in Jan 2014. In less than a week I was calling support because it kept crashing. I had to reset to factory conditions and redownload everything twice in the first two weeks.

They refused to send me a new one as replacement so I am now stuck with a piece of crap somebody else already sent back.One of the features I liked most about the old Kindle was Kindle Free Time... this is now crap.

Kindle Free Time is advertised as a safe way for kids to use the Kindle without worries about them accidentally going on the web or purchasing things.

This kindle is a constant headache. If she didn't love the games and movies so much, and if I had the money to re-buy all the movies/apps for some other tablet I would in a heartbeat.

I love the xray feature on the videos as that's how I found some of the music that I've also downloaded.  My only complaint is the glare on the screen its a killer outside and I even purchased a non glare screen protector so I gave up some screen clear quality for videos to be able to read outside but its still difficult in some sun.  Even tilting it.  I wish there was something that could be slipped on or off depending on inside or outside.  And the screen tilt turnaround confuses me as it starts up upside down then swings around the other way.  AND any case offered sucks..

I originally bought my kindle so that I could play my amazon instant videos on the go without having to lug my xbox or laptop around.  I am now switching over to google's marketplace because i do not want to have to use a kindle.  Here are some of the reasons why I sent it back.1. Kindle Fire HDX is not able to access all websites.  I was on the phone with customer service trying to resolve the issue and this is what they told me.  I was trying to access 'stocktwits.com' and my kindle could not navigate there.  Apparently this is the case with various sites.  I frequent stocktwits regularly, so this was a big deal for me.2.  Since kindle does not support adobe flash, you have to switch between \"desktop\" and \"mobile\" mode to get videos to play on various websites.  No rhyme or reason to this, but an annoying step to have to take.  This again is customer services solution to videos that wouldn't load on certain sites.3.  The screen is not customizable.  This doesn't sound like a big deal at first, but you'd be surprised at how annoying seeing advertisements each time you unlock your screen can be.  Customer service informed me there is no work around for this.4.  Kindles apps are not well supported.  I tried downloading the etrade app, and it didn't work.  the app would download, but it wouldn't work.  Etrade customer service informed me that they haven't fully developed the app for fire HDX's yet.  Not high on their list of priorities I guess.  I'm sure this is the same with many other apps.  I also could not download the stocktwits app.5.  There is a blue haze.  I know this is much talked about, but it is there.  It didn't really annoy me very much though.6.  Amazon uses the kindle to advertise to you like crazy.  My facebook feed had amazon ads at the top of my page.  my google email immediately became swarmed with amazon emails.  they suggest apps and items under the carousel.  they advertise each time you unlock the tablet.  i mean enough is enough!7.  I'm not impressed with the ease of navigating the device.  I think android is much more intuitive and user friendly, not to mention you have much more versatility since android is open source.Are there Pro's?  sure, but not enough to outweigh the cons for me personally.  It is a relatively snappy device.  The cost is low as well.  I think there are child protective functions if you have kids.If you are need to save money financially by going with the Kindle instead of a more expensive Android or Ipad (don't know much about Ipads), then a kindle may be for you.  But I was buying this strictly for access to amazon instant video, not so much because of price, and I was disappointed.  I really tried to make myself like it, since I love amazon as a company, but I am returning it and switching to Google movies.

Ultimately, an update broke my device, and even if I had managed to avoid the updates the tablet becomes nearly worthless without internet.  I'm very sorry that I bought from this company when there is another line of devices that would have worked much better for what I wanted and expected.  I wouldn't buy any other Amazon anything, they are worse than apple.  It's my device, I paid for it.  Amazon uses open source software that they get for no cost GNU, Linux, and Android and then they ruin it intentionally to lock in down and limit functionality.  Forcing people to buy from their appstore, stare at ads, and a dull black background.  Many of the apps available from amazon are old versions of apps that I already have paid for and use on my android phone and other devices.  I'm not going to pay again.  Amazon really stabbed us in the back on this one.  I've never had a device that didn't ask first before changing the software not even windows does that unless you op-in and you can always go turn off automatic updates.  Buying this tablet is the same as signing a contract with the devil, they managed to enslave free software and do whatever they want to your device without your approval.

I easily switch from app to app with the multitasking side bar.The speakers are amazing and exceed the iPad with relative ease.The display is awesome for gaming and videos, but I have been disappointed with the blue hue on the outer edges while holding the tablet in portrait mode with white backgrounds such as books or web pages.  Amazon's excuse for this is ridiculous (\"we use blue LCD instead of white to ensure 100% color accuracy\"), but I love everything else about the HDX so much, I choose to overlook this factor.The iPad is still a more complete tablet experience overall and it is much better for content creation and productivity.

I am so use to the iPad and had no problem adjusting to the Android operating system.

I've read online that Amazon is blaming the apps creator such as Netflix for the bugs but truthfully, I think it's combination of both.  My videos freeze up a lot while it's playing catch-up or I have to literally force the app to close and /or recycle power to the unit.  Only after I do that will the streaming app reinitialize again.  This is a royal pain in the butt in my opinion and i would hope that Kindle and partners come together to address these issues.

Overall, this is a pretty good choice if you are looking for something that runs smoothly. I really was impressed by the image quality, every thing looks gorgeous on this tablet, much better than my laptop! The processor keeps this device really quick with apps and while watching movies and surfing the web (depending on WiFi of course). The HDX also really shines if you have Amazon prime as you will have access to a variety of free movies and media! For all that this tablet can offer in terms of functionality, the price is really one of the better values out there right now.Despite some of the aforementioned positives, I there are a couple huge disadvantages to owning this tablet. If you plan on using a wide variety of apps, then you're going to be sorely disappointed. App development for Kindle is still in its infancy and only a handful of even the most popular apps on other devices seem to be available. One of the main things that I bought the HDX for was to surf the web without the need for a clunky laptop. For the most part, it can do this just fine, but when it comes to watching a video this tablet will let you down. I find that since there is no youtube app that I need to go to YouTube's site on the browser. When I try to watch the youtube video in full screen while holding the tablet horizontally, the address bar is always at the top blocking out some of the video! I have tried every button/setting but nothing seems to remove this. The other thing with videos that drives me mad is that most embedded videos on blogs and webpages cannot go into full screen mode. I need to click and double click on them repeatedly just to make the video big enough to be seen. Some embedded videos I have found to not work at all. This is really a huge disadvantage for me and really needs to be fixed.To summarize, the HDX is a great functioning device that performs great in terms of hardware specs, but there is much improvement to be made in regards to software aspects.UPDATE:4/21: I was disheartened the learn that the kindle does not support Adobe Flash player.

My husband then bought the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\". He watches videos on it all of the time. Amazon had a special around Super Bowl time so I bought the Kindle Fire HDX with 4G. Love it. It has frozen on me a couple of times but all you have to do is shut it down. This doesn't bother me because my iPhone and laptops have frozen also. There are some apps that are not available through Amazon but there are other ways to get most of the apps you want with investigation. I would really love to have Adobe Flash because some sites only use Flash for their videos, and one of those sites I pay $$ yearly to watch videos (yoga) but can't on the HDX, but I can on the Kindle Fire HD. I think that it is not Amazon's fault that Flash is not available on the Kindle, it has something to do with Adobe.When I took my new Kindle to Verizon they told me that the Kindle doesn't have 4G.

One of the associates had to call a lady back in because she told the customer that Kindle could not connect to 4G.This tablet is great. I've never used another brand, but I have watched others use theirs and I really don't see much difference, except maybe for the apps. And right now I have the apps I use.There is one negative to this device. It doesn't like to charge on any chargers/cables except the \"Kindle\" brand. It uses the same end as Samsung but when I use the Samsung charger it either doesn't charge at all, or takes a very long time to charge.", "Date": "March 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "good tablet, enjoy reading on it, but always room for improvement", "Author": "Stephanie", "ReviewID": "R3PIYIOQB0BC3G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was so excited to order this tablet. I mainly wanted it to read books on, which it definitely fulfills the purpose. Prior to this, I had been using a Nook Color that I bought 2 or 3 years ago to read books on. It has been discontinued, and of course due to Amazon's cheaper book prices, as much as I read, I.figured the Kindle would pay for itself in books over time.Pros:I love the way it feels in my hands. It's comfortable. It feels like I could actually be reading a lightweight book. It is much more lightweight than the Nook Color, despite having a screen the same size. A lot of people have said that the Kindle can have a glare when outside reading, which is why one should opt for the paperwhite instead. I took my kindle fire HDX fishing yesterday and read perfectly without glare, which I think may have something to do with my reading settings being set to look like  dark page with white writing on it. You can also change it to a white page with black writing, as normal, or to sepia. I love that it tells me how finished I am with a book (like 45% finished with book). That alone means a lot, because the Nook did not do that at all. The sound on the HDX is phenomenal. It sounds like I am sitting in a surround sound movie theater. My Nook Color, iPad Mini, Samsung Galaxy S4, nothing I have owned this far in the tablet and phone world has sounded as awesome as the HDX. I love the predictive keyboard, which to me is similar to my iPad minis, because I can make a lot of mistakes typing quickly. I enjoy the app selection. It is much much more than my nook color ever offered. I am a medical professional and must have epocrates installed on my device. It was right there for free in the app store and works beautifully on this device. I like the fact that if Amazon's store does not have any app I want, I can sideload it. I have only had my HDX for a few days, however, and have not found any apps to be missing thus far. So I have  not had to sideload anything yet. I hear it is not that difficult. The screen is also great and very hi def. I am not sure if it outranks my iPad though. They seem similar to me. I like how quickly the HDX loads movies,videos, and games without lag or having to reload.Cons: the ads you have to pay $15 to get rid of (but I sometimes enjoy seeing what they're offering. It prompts me to look at books I may have not consideredd before). The fact that you can't change the background of the screens home to anything you want. The poor quality front facing only camera on it. If you take the time to put a camera, why not make give it a front and rear with more megapixels to really compete with other tablets?", "Date": "March 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Technical problems (old age)", "Author": "rolland r smith", "ReviewID": "R218QTPXG1E3UQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I love my old Kindle, it is very easy to use however, I am an elderly gentleman and find the new one a little complicated for me.

The only thing is that the HDX has a different look for the Android Operating System which is actually very nice. It also doesn't have a rear facing camera, it only has a front facing one, like for apps such as Skype. We almost always use our cellphones for taking pictures, so that wasn't really a big concern for us.I would also recommend NOT paying the $15 to remove the lock screen only advertisements. My wife has already used them and they are actually pretty good. I really don't believe it's worth the money to have the ads removed but you can always pay the $15 at a later date if you eventually decide to remove them.Now that my wife actually has the HDX for over a month now, I realize that it's great and she really, really loves it!You will not be disappointed in purchasing the HDX, trust me, GET IT!!!VERY HELPFUL COMPARISON URL:blog.laptopmag.com/amazon-kindle-fire-hdx-vs-google-nexus-7", "Date": "February 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Seriously?

I'm not sure if this is because my Galaxy S4 is just enough (in terms of size) for me to do most of the things I need to do or if it is because a couple things about the HDX Fire that annoy me and thus got me to use it less.First, the charger it comes with is just too slow.  I realize the original charger is a 'slow' version and a 'fast' charger is sold separately, but the slow should not be a snail crawl charger.  Also, the Kindle crashed on me.  I called customer care, they helped me quickly reset the device to factory settings and it seemed to have fixed it.  I am concerned I have a defect though.  Regardless, they say I have a warranty and can get it replaced anytime within a year (I hope this stands true).  I'm always gun shy to exchange things quickly because OEMs tend to send you a refurb for your new device.These two items make the device a neutral buy rating for me.

I do not think there have been any disappointments with this tablet, but I am finding out daily how truly amazing this thing is.  I believe the most important asset for me is how all the books I bought between my Kindle keyboard and HD Fire, automatically loaded on my HDX, and they were already placled in collections.  I was dissapointed with the Kindle collections app by M. Gallagher because it was painstaking for me to try to categorize all my books (approx. 1,300+), and after getting a little over 200, the Collections app. crashed and had to start from scratch!

I am legally blind, so this is important to me.

You have little or no control over the information they can access on your kindle or amazon.  It seems to me that Amazon does not value the privacy of our personal information. Some Apps even make you agree to allow them to share PERSONAL INFORMATION with other advertisers and \"partners\" before allowing you to install.  If you don\u2019t agree, you cannot install.

If you want to remove them, it will cost you a fee.  (I think $15) Therefore, ads come with the Kindle.Bottom Line:  They have a great product here and they know it, I would have rated it a 5 Star if not for the BS.

I've been using a regular classic Kindle for book-reading for several years and I find the HDX 7 to be almost exactly the same size, slightly heavier, but just as convenient to use and transport - and with a wealth of great features! I purchased the upgraded version with 64GB memory, wireless only, and paid the $15 for \"without special offers\".  Great deal!  Colors are superb and the unit works fine with my AOL email & Facebook accounts.  Reading on-line news and FB text is a little challenging because of the small print but \"pinch & spread\" takes care of that pretty well although the larger 8.9\" Fire HDX would certainly be a bit better in that regard.  Book reading is fine, no problems, and the faint blue \"corona\" along the edges of the page is pretty inconsequential as far as I can see.Battery life is very good (especially when doing mostly book-reading) but if one is using a lot of battery-eating graphics a daily recharge will be a way of life.  Needless to say, my old Kindle shines in this respect because the battery typically only has to recharge once a month, but then the Fire HDX does *SO MUCH* more!Audio for music is adequate volume (although not ear-blastingly loud) through the speakers and great in headphones, and I find the audio quality excellent.  Controls are easy to learn and seem pretty intuitive to me.My only minor complaint is that the on-board camera faces the user, not the rear of the device - which is fine for Skype or taking photos of oneself if you're into that sort of thing - but then, who the heck uses a tablet for taking pictures, anyway?  I watched a fellow tourist doing that with his iPad when we were in Iceland and I thought - and still think - that it's a dumb way to take photos (I'll stick with my easier-to-carry and fractionally expensive digicam, thank you very much).FWIW, I'm 72 and strongly believe that any \"senior citizen\" who isn't embracing today's technology is missing out on a *LOT* that can keep life fun and the brain active. I've been using a compact netbook for several years while traveling but a tablet like the Fire HDX is a great and not bank account-breaking way to enjoy reading good books, catching up on email and news, following sports scores, using social networking, etc., etc., and all in a much more compact package.So, don't be an old fud, get with modernity!!!  ;-)", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "The best 7\" Tablet on the market!", "Author": "Mike R", "ReviewID": "R37ZK1X4Y66SO6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Absolutely the best tablet out there.

It works great with Amazon Prime, television episodes start within seconds(your internet speed may vary.) Movies look phenomenal on it, high definition especially. The sound quality is very good, with the dual speakers helping out a lot. A lot of my mp3 purchases have lyrics on screen that highlight each line as it is sung. I always want to know the names of the people on tv shows and movies, now just by touching the screen when they are on I can see who they are and background info on them. Ever watched a show and wanted to know the name of the song that is playing or who sings it, just touch the screen and it tells you.I owned the original Kindle Fire, which was okay at best, but the newest version is amazing. I also own an ipad 3, but the 7\" HDX is my favorite tablet of the two. My books, music, videos, audiobooks, apps and games are all in one little tablet.

At first I didn't really like it and felt completely lost on using a lot of functions on it.  I thought seriously about returning it.  I thought I would work with it and if I still hated it when Jan. 31st drew close I would return.Now that I've had time to use it and learn how to use functions on this device I wouldn't want to give it up.  The clarity of the pictures on this is amazing.  It's almost like watching a movie on BluRay.  That is how fantastic I think the picture is.  I am a Prime Member and  I like being able to download Prime movies and taking this with me and watching it at any time.  I can download a kids movie(s) and take it along for the kids to watch while traveling in the car.  I have the WIFI version and I don't have to worry when I am out of range of my WIFI connection.  I couldn't do this with my iPad when using Netflix.  A big  \"Thank You\" to  Amazon Prime & Kindle Fire HDX.I do a lot of reading on my Kindle Paperwhite and I like being able to sync it with this device and I can pick up where I left off on the other device.I did download a free Kindle book that also had Whispersync voice available for free.  Because it was an opportunity to try it for free, I activated the Whispersync Voice.  I was amazed at how easy it was to switch from text to audio and back to text.  Kindle  Fire HDX  keeps perfect track of the furtherest point you have read no matter which function you are using, text or audio.  I can listen to audio on the Kindle Fire HDX and pick up at the point I left off with text on my Kindle Paperwhite.  I think Whispersync Voice is one of the best features there is on this device.As I continue learning how to  use more and more functions on this, the more I love it.Bottom line, I would recommend the Kindle Fire HDX over any other device I have used.  I wouldn't want to be without either device, my Kindle Fire HDX or my Kindle Paperwhite.  Would be lost without them.", "Date": "January 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love It!!!!", "Author": "Janet E.

The rubbery frame is easy to hold, and doesn't feel cheap. The viewing area (reportedly Gorilla glass) is generous and fairly smudge free.Integration with Google apps like gmail, calendar, etc is very easy. My inbox, contacts, and entire calendar were up and running in just a few minutes.Tunes sound good, whether it be from my own collection in the Amazon cloud, via Pandora, or on YouTube. Placing the Kindle face up on a hard surface optimizes tone and volume.Most website functionality is comparable to a PC, but there are the occasional pages that look funny. As an example, I use my Kindle as an auxiliary while playing Battlefield 4, and while it's usually easy to manipulate, there are times when screen resolution makes buttons/web parts awkward.As far as books, I only have a few so far. Some seem better adapted to the Kindle format than others; The Oatmeal's \"How to Tell if Your Cat is Plotting to Kill You\" is flawless, but Sun Tzu's \"Art of War\" has the occasional odd hard-return.Although the auto-brightness feature is a nice touch, but I've found that it sometimes it will \"adjust\" for no reason. Still not enough to drop it down from 5 stars.I can't comment on Facebook or Twitter functionality as I use neither of those, but the StumbleUpon app is fun.If my Kindle HDX gets broken, for whatever reason, I would buy another without hesitation.

She is a writer and she reads books as fast as I can watch a couple of movies.  What a perfect gift I thought this would be.  However - she has always told me she never wanted one because it's not the same as turning a real page.Well - over time Kindles have come a long way by adding many useful features.  I'm a guy and what I like I figure she would like - right?  So I bought it.  So as to be sure she realized the kindle is now something real and useful in so many other ways, I first prepared the Kindle introduction video. Kimble has a great video explaining all the benefits that it does.I prepared the TV which we have hooked up to a computer to first show her the video before opening the box to see what it is.  I figured once she saw all the cool stuff it does she would defiantly have a change of heart by loving it and wanting it.She saw the video, opened it up and began learning it all.  Kindle has a REALLY good feature.  Tap one button and a live person comes on screen to guide you through anything at all.  They can even do it for you by drawing circles around what they click and do so you can see and learn - really making it easy.My wife learned enough very fast as to contact this live tech person on Christmas day.And, she asked him for help.  Within no time at all he, according to her directions took no time at all to coordinate the return of the Kimble, even with a return label to print out.Well - That's how my Christmas went.(guys skip this part and don't read) To all of the ladies reading this:  I respect your thoughts, wants and needs.(woman skip this part and don't read) To all the guys reading this:  You can't win so buy her a vacuum cleaner it couldn't be worse than anything else you do>", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "A minor tradeoff between Amazon Prime benefits and Google Play access...", "Author": "R.

So you need to ask yourself if access to such features as the Kindle Lending Library and tight integration with Amazon Prime and Audible are valuable to you, as well as the \"Mayday\" tech support function.For me specifically, the feature I miss is the app-based Google Music Player.  I capture streamed spoken-word radio which I want to then listen to on all my devices (iPhone, Kindle Fire HDX, Roku-outfitted TV).  Google's uploader can be set up to automatically scan my music folders and refresh my library with any new content, and Amazon's uploader does not do that.While Google does offer a web version of their music player - which works fine in the Silk browser - it doesn't have as many features as their native app.Other than that, I've been quite happy so far.  Suggestion - find a way to sideload any apps you might like from the Google Play store; many will work fine on the Kindle Fire.  One example would be Zinio for magazine content.

To tell the truth, I have been meaning to buy a similar reading device with tablet capabilities and couldn\u2019t figure out whether to buy the Nook HD, the Kindle Fire HDX or the Sony Experia Z Ultra. Of course it\u2019s a matter of money. I am not made of the green stuff and even a $300 expense is big enough for me to think three times before buying something first in order to try it out. I read all the reviews, all the personal experiences put out by people, but still, it isn\u2019t the same as having the thing at home to play around with.This way works the best \u2013 they sent the 32GB version that I had chosen in less than 3 days.From the moment I got the package in my hands, I was in love. It is simply great \u2013 it does (almost) everything an IPAD does at a fraction of the cost.First, the cons \u2013 as I am sure there\u2019s ample information on the pros.1. The camera is ONLY on the front \u2013 there is no camera behind the screen. Makes skyping and taking pictures just a tad harder. Not a dealbreaker though, given all the other great stuff this little tablet does.2.  The page turning is by swipes only. When you are tucked in a cozy comforter on a cold night, you sometimes wish for right/left buttons \u2013 again, a minor annoyance.3. The weight \u2013 it\u2019s a tad heavier than the Sony Experia Z Ultra. But honestly, if losing weight means spending $400 extra, I can do without it!4. The included charger is really slow \u2013 I spent the extra money for the power charger. Only I didn\u2019t spend $19.99 on Amazon \u2013 I got it on eBay (new) from China, for $5.22, free shipping. Still waiting on it, but its guaranteed to arrive in a couple of days.  Works for me!5. I am an Amazon Prime buff \u2013 in fact Prime content is the prime reason why I chose the Kindle. It works great \u2013 only your \u2018watchlist\u2019 shows perhaps a quarter of what you have saved. If there is a way to see the entire watchlist, I haven\u2019t discovered it (yet).6. The carousel is annoying. It pops up unbidden whenever the Kindle\u2019s turned on. I don\u2019t need to display exactly what books and movies I have purchased and would have preferred if there was a way to discreetly tuck them away only to be brought out when I wish.7. Browsing emails on yahoo can sometime be frustrating \u2013 scrolling is immensely difficult as the tablet, to me, seems too sensitive \u2013 whether I use a stylus or my fingers, it tends to pop open the email instead of allowing me to scroll thru the list.8. Downloading movies is not too cool \u2013 takes too long and if the Kindle powers off, there you go. Lost the portion that you had already downloaded and need to restart.That\u2019s the lot of semi-bad news, if you can call it that. To me, it\u2019s all stuff I can live with, nothing major. Here\u2019s the positive stuff:1. It is GREAT to watch a movie or a show on. The picture (we have a high-speed broadband Wi-Fi) is crystal clear; there is NO dithering or wait time as the video caches. It\u2019s like watching your own personal wrap around widescreen. You might think the size would be too small, but when you do watch it, the screen\u2019s placed close enough to your face comfortably and it actually seems like a much larger screen. Like I said, GREAT definition and clarity.2. The sound\u2019s amazing \u2013 clear, sharp and realistic. Even without headphones, it\u2019s powerful enough to give true surround effect and loud enough to make my wife complain. With headphones, you don\u2019t disturb anyone and the immersion is complete. BTW I bought JLabs Jbud J5 ear buds with this after doing some R&D; (read my review if you wish \u2013 I even bought an extra pair for the wife) and it\u2019s a perfect match right off the top. Tailor made for the Kindle Fire HDX.3. Reading books is easy, except that a couple of left/right/page turning buttons wouldn\u2019t have hurt. The light levels\u2019s just right and if a white page glares at you, voila, make the screen black, the letters white! Bunch of choices in terms of fonts (publisher\u2019s font included) and one can size them up or down as required.4. Browsing \u2013 the silk browser is really great. Fast, no nonsense stuff.5. People talk about the \u2018offers\u2019 as annoying \u2013 I find it extremely entertaining. Not just are the products good (no TV infomercials here) but also the entire ad experience is VERY unobtrusive. Flick it off whenever you wish and go back using the tab.6. Navigating the Kindle is great (except perhaps the carousel feature which I didn\u2019t like). Downloading documents and files, pictures etc is really fast, movies, not so much as explained in \u2018Cons\u2019.7. Best part is its portability. The 7\u201d is slightly too big to slip into the back pocket of my jeans and a jacket pocket is required. However if you do sort out the carrying issue, it\u2019s great to have along and works everywhere there\u2019s Wi-Fi.8. I took the Boingo Wi-Fi on the go service and so far haven\u2019t had too much trouble with it. Of course it\u2019s not as fast as it\u2019s touted to be and there is a tendency to hook you to the nearest network instead of the dedicated Boingo network, but hey, whatever works. I am not that finicky. It takes a bit of time to get hooked, but once it does, it\u2019s a strong link and stays hooked unless you move a few blocks.9. The case and paraphernalia. I definitely wouldn\u2019t recommend spending $50-60 on the recommended sleeves and cases. I bought the Fintie faux leather package and for $20 approx, got a nice collection of stylus, sleeve, extra USB cable and some other small stuff. Works even better if you just buy the Fintie case for about $9.99. You definitely need a bigger case to stuff all those bits and pieces though \u2013 the charger, USB, stylus, headphones etc. I also bought a screen protector and a TPU Gel soft skin cover to be used in parallel with my Fintie case as added protection. It\u2019s a tighter fit, but works perfectly.All in all, it\u2019s a GREAT purchase and I am loving it. Will be happy to answer any specific questions that anyone has.

The video quality was awesome. It was the video that they had on the demo model that was crap. Yes the new HDX models have that blue border when reading books. The solution to that is changing the background color to back with white letters. If there is one thing negative I can say about this particular model its the size. While using it to browse the web, I realized maybe the 8.9 model would be a touch better just bc it is bigger. But if you are used to using a cell phone to browse the web then its not really an issue bc u would be used to swiping around a web page. And one more thing. Why not put a second camera on this thing like the 8.9? That would make more sense. That would make the HDX 7 awesome! IMO, the only choice you have to make is which HDX to buy.

This review will evolve as I continue to use the device, but my initial impressions are...this is a fantastic device for the money.I still own a first-generation Kindle Fire whose stock OS and user experience were so bad I had to eventually root it and install stock Android Jelly Bean on it to make it usable. That Amazon has progressed from that to this in two years' time is remarkable.If you're worried about value, don't: just buy one if you think you want one (that's kind of a quote from a photography expert who has a blog and reviews a lot of gear). The value for the money here is incredible.Here are my pros and cons, which I will expand upon as I return to this review and update it periodically as I do more with the HDX.PROS:+ The screen. I've been trying to get an hour's worth of work done at the office, but I just can't take my eyes off the display. It is gorgeous, bright, sharp, accurate. Everything the pro reviewers have said about this display is true, but it doesn't prepare you for the actual first glimpse. It's an awesome panel.+ The sound. I fired up \"Smokey and the Bandit\" and was perplexed by the quality and volume of sound coming from the seemingly tiny speakers on the back of the device. Despite their location, it seems like the sound is coming right out of the screen. The engineers knocked a homerun here. Unless you're practicing privacy, headphones or external speakers are not essential.+ The design. The tapered edges give the device an ultra-slim appearance when viewed from most angles from the front side of the device, yet the body has sufficient thickness to be gripped and held easily. When the screen is off, it is very difficult to see the screen's location within the bezel...like a solid sheet of black. It is well-built, but it is light. And it's balanced well--I'm using an old Incipio stand originally designed for a Galaxy Nexus phone with the HDX, and it's perfectly stable and solid.+ Ease of use and setup. Within five minutes of unboxing, the device was ready for use, and that included downloading an OS update, setting up two email accounts, a Facebook account and a Twitter account. Amazon's ability to pre-register the device prior to shipping is huge.CONS- Blue screen edges. Most of the time they're not distracting, and I understand that they're \"necessary\" given the fact Amazon chose to use blue LED's to illuminate the screen and ensure close-to-100% color accuracy. But when browsing webpages or reading books, at my present stage of HDX enjoyment, they are a bit of a distraction. I'm hoping I get used to them. (10:56 AM, 12/23/13)- Amazon's app ecosystem. This is not a knock on the device but rather an indictment of Amazon's app store. But my hunch is that with the HDX devices developers will get cracking on making the freshest versions of apps available for Kindle Fire devices sooner and in greater quantity. Specifically, Spotify is ages old compared to the current versions available for iOS and Android, and more seriously crippling is the fact that the version Amazon offers does not support Spotify's new free-listening initiatives for mobile devices and tablets. Let's hope this improves soon.More to come...but again, this device at the price Amazon is asking is simply a no-brainer.

Baca \"happy mommy\"", "ReviewID": "RTV91WXMRQCC0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A Kindle was not even on my list of possible tablets to get. I was interested in the Samsung Note 8 (played with for a little bit at Best Buy). But Amazon offered me a 30-day free trial with a Kindle of my choice and I found that this was too tempting to pass up! Being an Amazon Prime member is awesome and it's truly the best way to get the full Kindle HDX experience! My 30-days are almost up and I plan on keeping my Kindle HDX. Here are my reasons why:1. MayDay. How awesome is this! I used this feature because I was having issues with one of my apps. The attendant came up as soon as soon as I pressed connect and was very patient and understanding while I was trying to explain my issue. Eventually I did have to get on the phone and speak with someone else but the attendant stay with me even while I was discussing my problem with the rep to make sure the rep understood what the issue was. This is by far the best thing about this device hands down!2. Amazon Prime. If you are a Prime member then you already know that you can get free movies and shows but if you have a Kindle device you can also get free books through the lending library (this was new to me!) and there are a tones of books to choose from. Going back to the movies and shows, I like that I have the option of downloading them onto my Kindle for travel (great feature for kids!) or going places where I know I won\u2019t have access to Wi-Fi.3. Shopping experience. I shop a lot through Amazon (which is why I am a Prime member) and this device just makes it incredibly easy to do just that. I think the Amazon coin option for purchasing apps is a great idea and have used them on a few apps for my kids.The only down sides of the Kindle for me are:1. There\u2019s no true YouTube app. I love YouTube and watch it pretty regularly. There are ones available in the kindle store but the best one I found so far (vTube?) doesn\u2019t quite function the same as the Google app on my iPhone. You have option of viewing YouTube through the Silk browser but a dedicated app that functioned more like (or better than!) the Google app would be ideal.2. You can\u2019t customize your home screen. You have this huge carousel thing at the top of the tablet\u2019s home screen and some (random?) apps that are at the bottom. I would like the option of at least customizing this screen since it\u2019s the first thing I see when the tablet unlocks.3. The ads are annoying. I wanted to see how I would respond to having the ads on the tablet to know if it was worth spending the extra $15 dollars to have them taken off. It is! It\u2019s annoying! My kids have seen some ads geared towards kids and ask for the stuff! We watch Netflix, Amazon, and ITunes content exclusively specifically to avoid advertisements and this has reminded me why we do! Pay the $15!For the price and all the extras you get with being a Prime member, keeping the Kindle HDX is a no brainer for me!", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "The BEST KINDLE YET!!!", "Author": "Rick", "ReviewID": "RKLBDR1Y6EQLQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I LOVE MY NEW KINDLE FIRE HDX.

All of my friends and family are blown away by the display first off and just continue to be more impressed as they get further into it's features. Everybody is impressed by the sound of the music and the quality of the colors in the display. I had the opportunity to use the May day button when my wife had a problem with a game she purchased on her kindle (she made me buy her an HDX after she saw mine), anyway she purchased a game for the grandchildren to play but it failed to show up in our library so she pressed the May day button. A representative came on well within the 15 second goal. After about a minute n Ute of discussing the problem the internet at my house flickered off for just a minute and cut us off. What then happened next is why I am an absolutely loyal customer. Before I could even get my Kindle reconnected my phone rang and it was another rep calling to finish helping with my problem and then when the device finished reconnecting the original rep came back on the device to also help me. Needless to say we got the situation solved to my complete satisfaction, amazing customer  service. One other feature that we really like is the ability to download movies from Amazon Prime and take them with us when we travel to our house in the mountains.

I've been using mine for a little over a week. It is a great replacement for my old Kindle Fire. I've read in the Kindle Forum that some people have had a problem with 'blue fringe' on the screen edges.  I noticed it when I first started using it but I don't notice it anymore unless I specifically look for it. Typically I read books with black background and white text. I have an iPad 3 with Retina display, too, that I am also happy with but for reading I definitely prefer the Kindle.Pros:01. It is very light and thin.02. Awesome display. The display is very crisp. It's very easy to read books, magazines and movies look as good as they do on my HD TV.03. The home page and Carousel are much improved. The home page area below the Carousel took a little getting used to but I like it now.04. The new options in the App Store, Book Store, Music Store, etc.05. Much easier to add items, such as books or apps, to wish lists.06. Silk Browser. Didn't like it on my old Kindle Fire but it's much improved on the Fire HDX, imho.07. I like the book recommendations displayed under the books in the Carousel. They aren't obtrusive.08. The new Shop tab.09. The (new) native calendar app.10. The improved native email and contacts apps which can be synched with my Google account.11. Mayday! I've used it a couple of times and it is easy and convenient.12. The physical volume rocker control.13. The charging port is much tighter than on my previous Kindle Fire.14. Being able to display the battery percentage with out an app.15. The camera is pretty cool. Don't see myself using it much, if at all, but it's cool that it's there.Cons:01. Even with a cover it is sometimes difficult to hold for long periods of time. I have arthritis in both hands so that may only be a problem for me.02. It is occasionally glitchy. I've had to do a hard reboot a couple of times. Hopefully today's update will take care of that.03. The Amazon App store. I realize this isn't a 'con' of the Kindle Fire HDX but wanted to add that in my review. The Google Play Store (for my phone) and ITunes (for my iPad) have much more to offer.If I think of, or encounter, any other cons I will add them to my review.My Kindle received the latest update today and it added some cool upgrades. The new lock screen is nicer now that it displays the number of unread emails, battery percentage, date and time and new wallpaper. The GoodReads integration is really useful and the ability to create Collections....at last! Smart look up is cool...not earth shattering cool but cool nonetheless. The alarm is nice although I don't know that I'll use it. Second screen is a nice function (assuming it works) but I don't have a Samsung TV or PS3. The print function is a really cool, convenient function although as of yet it doesn't work with my Canon printer. The Canon app is crap. 1 Tap Archive might not be something that I'll use but I suppose it could be useful. The Amazon Cloud Drive is very, very useful. It's an easy, convenient way to move photos and documents from computer to Kindle and mobile phone to Kindle.I received the original Kindle as a Christmas gift one year and the original Kindle Fire as a Christmas gift the following year and was very happy with both of them.

However, after receiving the kindle I realized that 2 of the 10 or so apps that I do use were unavailable (Dropbox and Olive Tree Bible Study). Before ordering I had inquired with Olive Tree and been told they had a kindle fire app. Unfortunately they're experiencing delays with amazon and the hDX. I assume that will work out eventually.

The 2 HDX's are the only Kindle products I've ever had to return. This has the potential to be a great tablet once the bugs are worked out.  The bugs consist mainly of dropped wifi connections, the tablet showing a pop up message that you're not connected to a network when the notification icon shows fully connected, and completely \"forgetting\" wifi networks on a regular (almost daily) basis.  The first one was \"buggy\" out of the box, and I had to do 2 factory resets before it would even connect to a wifi network and allow me to register.  I tried factory resets numerous times on the first one and finally returned it.  I then purchased another one and it functioned out of the box, but the wifi issues started within 24 hours.  I did a couple of factory resets and the issues persisted along with random restarts.  After researching the issue online, it appears to be common.  I contacted customer service...who are always fantastic simply to ask if they planned a software or hardware \"fix\" for these issues.  They offered to exchange the tablet.  In my experience, Amazon is always very quick to fix any software issues...but not so much for hardware.  The solution always appears to be to stand behind the hardware and exchange it if justified.  I've had fantastic experiences with their customer service department.  But then again we buy the majority of our groceries, toiletries, household items and gifts from them...so it's obvious we're very loyal customers.  But in this case after having the same issue with 2 units purchased 3 weeks apart, I opted to simply return the HDX and wait for future \"fixes\" or for my HD to break beyond repair.  My Fire HD still works great, and I don't need to spend $250 on a table with \"OK\" improvements that is buggy,  I read and watch movies.  The screen on the HDX is bettter than the HD, but the speakers aren't quite as good.  It's certainly lighter and detaches from the cover easier, but the Origami cover isn't true to the original.  The original \"origami\" cover would allow you to position the Fire in at least 3 positions including a slanted keyboard setting...the new one only does vertical and horizontal.  We use the video out on the Kindle HD a lot while travelling so the kids can watch \"safe\" shows in hotels rather than risking the exposure to ^%&$ on hotel cable.  The HDX can employ a wireless device, but it has no mini HDMI out like the HD.  While the volume buttons on the HD were poorly positioned, at least you could reach them while holding the unit in it's case.  When using the Origami case with the HDX the buttons are covered.  So the HDX is faster, lighter, smaller, better screen, better UI, worse speakers, worse connectivity and buggy.  The HD is slightly heavier and larger, fantastic screen but not as good as the HDX.  But it's a 7\" screen...I'm still trying to figure out why anyone needs that high of resolution on a 7\" screen...but people want it on a 4.7\" phone so...  The HD has better speakers and connectivity.  For those interested, the HD can also be \"rooted\" without losing the Kindle UI or access to Prime instant video features.  As of the time of this review, \"rooting\" HDX has presented issues for those that don't REALLY know what their doing.  Of course I would never recommend doing this either way since it voids the warranty, but at least there are ways to get that other \"store\" on the HD without losing all the great Amazon features.

I was originally thinking about purchasing the newly released iPad mini Retina display for its smaller screen size, having previously owned the original iPad, then iPad 2 (as well as BlackBerry PlayBook). But then one day I received a 30-day free trial offer for a Kindle Fire HDX from Amazon, and I said to myself \"why not\" and opted for the 8.9-inch version with the thought that I would just play with it for a couple of weeks and then return it and buy the iPad mini, never suspecting that I would fall in love with the graphics, sound, and ease of use of a Kindle Fire HDX. I still returned the free-trial 8.9-inch one but decided to purchase the 7-inch version, because the former was still a bit too large for my need (recall I have the bigger iPad and iPad2).The 8.9-inch version of this Kindle (the one that I free-tried) doesn't have the bluish borders, the 7-inch version does. I read about this issue while waiting for the delivery my 7-inch version while still using the 8.9-inch version and became concerned. But guess what, it turns out that the borders do not bother me at all. No big deal! I can read each of my e-books just fine.

The horsepower running this modified Android tablet makes all of the applications hum along.

I expect to see several adapters shortly that will allow you to use the Miracast functionality to \"throw\" your Kindle screen on to your TV so that you can use the TV to watch movies that are running on your Kindle.  Miracast has to take the place of the missing HDMI out port that was included in the last Kindle Fire tablet.  All in all, this tablet is a noticeable step up from the last generation.  It is a fully functional tablet, and with the \"side loading\" of applications from the Google Play store you can use this tablet for just about any Android application (although some games from Google Play must be connected to Google Play in order to function).By the way...I used the Mayday function to ask about a setting on the tablet.  I was very impressed by how quickly I was connected to a technical support agent, and how helpful the agent was in answering my question.

I believe this note is a recent addition, but it would've been easy to miss earlier. It's close to the top of the page and is under the heading We want you to know, followed by Learn more about design decisions to help make an informed purchase. This links to the following statement: \"We want you to know...The Kindle Fire HDX 7\" has perfect color accuracy (100% sRGB), and we wanted to share more details around our display design decisions that helped us achieve this.You may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. All displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy. Most LCD displays use white LEDs, and then apply filters to extract the desired color. The result is oftentimes a compromise to tone and color accuracy, or--if attempting to address these compromises--an increase in battery consumption and, thus, device weight.We've taken a different approach. To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7\" at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20% improvement in power efficiency.\"So amazon's official stance is that the glowing blue border results from deliberate design decisions and is therefore not a manufacturing defect. We'll all have to decide for ourselves whether this is true and that all subsequent HDXs will have the same effect.I'm giving this three stars because I think amazon should've warned people about the blue border in advance. I do otherwise like the HDX in comparison to my first gen Fire and would give it four stars. I'm going to spend the next couple of weeks deciding whether I'll become accustomed enough to the blue border to no longer notice it (this is already happening to some extent).", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cannot borrow audible books from your public library with this kindle.

After an hour of being shuffled, disconnected and otherwisw aggravated with \"customer service\" I was told that the app writers would have to change their app to make it compatible.  Unlike most free apps that run constant ads the one click digital app is provided by our public library who can ill afford to make those software changes each time kindle develops a new version of its tablet.  Since we know previous kindles have had the software written to make them compatible we also must logically conclude that they could continue to do so.  It does not take a genius to figure out why  the new hdx was made incompatible.  Shame on you for effectively eliminating many peoples ability to obtain audible content.

FORM FACTOR - Compared to both the original Kindle Fire and the Fire HD, the HDX is lighter and thinner. Edges on the back are curved though not fully rounded, they still make it easy to grip the device. I can comfortably hold it in portrait mode in one hand between my thumb and palm and type with the other hand. The size and light weight makes it comfortable for one-handed reading for longer periods of time. There is a power button and volume +/- buttons on the back. The buttons are as easily accessible in landscape mode, but I'm still getting used to using them in portrait mode.2. SCREEN - This screen is the best in terms of resolution I have seen so far, sharper than its predecessors. There is no blurring of images or text under bright or dark background screens. Try pinch-zooming on an image, you will see that the integrity of the picture holds up pretty well despite zooming in real close. Reading e-books on this screen is easier on the eyes than reading on an iPad. I personally prefer to use my old e-ink Kindle to read books, but when traveling I plan to use the HDX. It doesn't strain the eyes as much as most other tablet screens that I have seen.3. SPEAKERS - I briefly compared speakers of the HD and HDX by playing the same song and maximizing the volume on both. The Fire HD's speakers were definitely louder when cranked up, but the difference was not significant. The speakers on the HDX however have better sound quality compared to the Mini for sure. That said, I personally don't buy tablets for their surround sound. I mostly use a tablet either with headphones or connected to a TV.4. STORAGE - I bought the 16GB version and I am already thinking I should probably upgrade to the 32GB. Of the 16GB, there is perhaps approximately 11-12GB available for end use, just an estimate - I could be off on this. This leaves little space if I want to store my entire music and video collection on the device, along with pictures and apps. For an extra $40, the 32GB is looking like a pretty good option. That being said, if you have most or all your collection stored on Amazon's Cloud Drive which you can stream to the HDX, the 16GB should be good.5. SPEED - The HDX is noticeably faster than the original Fire, and also feels improved over the Fire HD. Apps and videos load quicker. The most noticeable difference in speed is when browsing. Browsing on the Silk platform is smoother and less choppy. The difference is more evident when you go back from the HDX to browsing on an earlier generation Fire or another device.6. BATTERY - The HDX came with a micro-USB power charger! Advertised battery charging time is under 6 hours. Once fully charged, run time is said to be approximately 11 hours. Plenty for an average user like me, I use it probably 2-3 hours at most on any given day. This is supposed to have better battery life compared to that of its predecessor.7. CAMERA - The HDX 7\" version comes with a front facing camera only for Skype or other video calls. I tried the front camera briefly, picture quality seemed good for Skype calls. The 8.9\" however, comes with both a front and rear camera. I myself don't really use tablets to take pictures, I have my phone for that, but if you would really like to take pictures with this device, the 8.9\" would be the way to go.8. WITH OR WITHOUT SPECIAL OFFERS - I have always bought the Fires with special offers to save $15. Figured I always had the option of paying this amount later and removing the ads if they annoyed me. However, the ads appear only on the lock screen, which I don't look at any way, so it doesn't bother me at all. If ads on the lock screen annoy you or if you want a more personalized lock screen, you can simply pay the extra $15 and it goes away.SOME REALLY NICE FEATURES:The following features, in my opinion, are a game changer in favor of the Kindle Fire HDX:1. MAYDAY - A one-button tap gets you online with a live support agent within an advertised 15 seconds (swipe down on the time on top of the screen, MayDay button appears as one of the options). You can see the agent, but the agent can only hear you (though I think the agent should be able to see you if you fired up the front camera, but that's only if you want the agent to see you). The agent can take control of the device and help with any questions you may have. I tried this service once, connected in 15-20 seconds, agent walked me through trying to stream video through Apple TV (wasn't compatible). Audio and video quality was good, but I just found it weird looking at someone while getting support. Maybe it'll take getting used to, I guess I'm just so used to getting support over the phone.As of now, I'm not sure if the MayDay service is provided for the life of the device, or for the warranty period only, or if there's a charge for the service once the warranty expires. If someone familiar with this can post a comment, that would be very much appreciated.2. OFFLINE PRIME CONTENT - This is another really cool feature that has been added. Prime videos can be downloaded to the device for offline viewing - extremely useful for travelers when you don't have wireless coverage or wi-fi available! However, note that not all movies or shows can be downloaded - there are titles that are available only for online viewing. I guess this probably has to do with the studios and what titles they have agreed to make downloadable. Nevertheless, as long as I can download 4-6 hours of content for a flight, that is all I need! Once I return from a trip, I can simply delete the movies and download new ones. With this feature, a lower storage capacity device becomes more viable because I don't need to keep downloaded movies on it at all times. I can delete and add as I wish. This feature also helps save on wireless minutes. You can download a movie at home over Wi-Fi and play it on the road without spending 3G minutes to stream.3. SECOND SCREEN - This feature is expected to be available soon so I haven't had a chance to try it yet. With Second Screen, the Kindle screen can be mirrored on to your TV. From the description, it appears that the HDX does more than just mirroring - you can stream a movie to your TV and then use the HDX to check emails, browse the web, etc - basically you are free to use your tablet for anything while it is streaming to your TV. If this is true, this is a major step ahead of what most other tablets are capable of doing in this regard. With my iPad, I can only mirror the screen but I can't use it for anything else while it is streaming to my TV. I am excited to try out this new feature, will post an update once this feature is made available.Note - In order to stream to your TV, you will need a Smart TV or a compatible device like PS 3/4. If you don't have a TV or device that can connect wirelessly, you will need a Miracast dongle that plugs into your TV's HDMI port and can be set up on your wireless network to communicate with the HDX. I bought a dongle like this for around $100 a few years ago, but I think you can now find them here on Amazon for $40-50 (you can search for \"Miracast dongle\"). It is possible some devices are unable to connect because of their software or other compatibility issues. So for devices like say the Apple TV or Google Chromecast, if they are incompatible right off the bat, you can search online for apps that make them compatible with the HDX.4. FREETIME - This is a neat feature for families with kids, both in terms of time and content management. (i) Time - We have two boys and we try to keep tablet time in check (one hour each day Fri-Sun). Sometimes it's difficult to get them to let go when their time is up, and the ensuing battle never ends! With this feature, we have the option to set a time limit so the kids know automatically when their time is up. We also have the option of leaving a category like reading without a time limit. (ii) Content - We can basically create a sub-profile within the HDX and choose what content we want to be available in there. This is like creating a tablet within a tablet in some ways. Within the sub-profile, we can choose what games, apps, videos they can watch, and also change the backdrop to make it look like a kid's tablet. Very thoughtfully executed design.CONs:1. NO HDMI - The HDX no longer has the Micro HDMI port that last year's Fire HD came with. I thought this was a great feature to connect the device to TVs particularly when traveling. This also made it easier to connect the device to audio receivers to blast music through external speakers. With HDMI gone, you simply have to rely on wi-fi to connect to a TV. Most hotels are not equipped with smart TVs in rooms yet. So if you absolutely want to use the HDX to watch videos on your hotel room TV, you will need to carry the Miracast dongle as well. If the lack of HDMI is a deal breaker for you, I think last year's Fire HD might be the way to go.2. NO EXPANDABLE STORAGE - It would have been helpful if the HDX came with a memory card slot that could be used to play movies or content from an external storage device. This would leave the HDX storage itself open for apps and other content that must be stored on the tablet to be used. Also, expandable storage would mean that the 16GB version of the device would be good enough. However, if you have most content on Amazon's Cloud or have purchased volumes of movies/music from Amazon, lack of this feature shouldn't be an issue for you.3. NO GOOGLE PLAY APPS - Even though it runs on an Android platform, the HDX doesn't have access to Google Play which means the selection of apps available on the HDX is limited. That being said, it is fairly simple to install apps that are not otherwise available within the Amazon app store. You can run a Google search on \"how to add external apps (or Google Play apps) on Kindle Fire.\" It's pretty straightforward. I have found that the downloaded apps work great. Just remember to NOT root the Fire when installing these apps.4. 7\" HDX LACKS REAR CAMERA - The 7\" comes with only a front facing camera for video calls, it doesn't have a rear-facing camera. I personally don't need a rear camera on my tablet, but if you definitely need one, you can go for the 8.9\" which has both a front and rear facing camera.ACCESSORIES:1. CASE - I bought two cases with the device - the Amazon Origami case and the Marware Origin case. Origami - more stylish, functional, various stand positions, excellent quality, $50. Marware - inexpensive at $20, stand, basic frugal choice.2. SCREEN PROTECTOR - The Kindle screen is pretty good against scratches, but I have put a screen protector on regardless. I got the Marware screen protector - good quality and keeps the screen clear like there's nothing there.3. MIRACAST DONGLE - There are several adapters you can find here on Amazon. You will need this for streaming to your TV if you don't have a Smart TV or a compatible wireless device like PS3/4.4. CHARGERS - If you need to purchase additional chargers or cables, regular Micro-USB chargers/cables will work fine.BOTTOM LINE - Compared to the previous Kindle Fire versions and other tablets that I have used, the HDX is lighter, faster, has an excellent screen, and is loaded with some amazing features. All this for $229 makes the device a great choice. Whether or not to buy the HDX is entirely a personal decision. In my humble opinion, the choices:(i) If you have a recent tablet like say the Fire HD and are contemplating an upgrade, the upgrade may be worthwhile if you absolutely must have some of the new features (like Second Screen or offline Prime content).(ii) If the new features are not that meaningful for your purposes, it may be better to stay with your current device and wait for the next round of device releases.(iii) If this is the first tablet you are considering, scroll to the top and add to cart.", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not a secure device", "Author": "Sclark", "ReviewID": "RM5PVQMEOK68P", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered the Kindle Fire HDX, based on all of the favorable reviews.  My only complaint is that the device is not secure, right out of the box.  While the Kindle may be great at what it is intended to do, I pretty much rejected it due to a lack of security and regard to my Amazon account.  I am writing this review as a word of caution to others who may order it:When you order the Kindle, Amazon will ask you if you want to pre-register it.  They are doing this as there were many complaints of registrations failing after customers received the device, so they pre-register it for you before shipping, to cut down the amount of calls to their support.  The bad part of this is that, straight out of the box, you can click on \"Shop Amazon\" and go straight into your account.  The app, or the Kindle itself, does not ask for your credentials.  What this means is that my Kindle could have been mis-delivered, someone could have opened the box, powered on the Kindle, and had immediate access to my Amazon account (settings, Order History....everything).  I was even able to go shopping and could have made purchases, all without being prompted for my account credentials.Even with a passcode lock on the device, once registered and accessed, the Kindle prompts you no further for your Amazon credentials.  For some folks this might be OK, but for others who loan their Kindle to their kids, friends, or are just plain security conscious, this may be an issue for them.  It would be nice to see Amazon step up security and regard for customer's privacy on their portable devices.", "Date": "April 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Piece of crap", "Author": "anaconda", "ReviewID": "R2YNLEQJNKHA4Y", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I thought I was gonna like this...

Bought the Kindle DX, then upgraded to the Kindle HD last year and purchased Amazon prime for the Prime streaming of TV and movies. So when they announced the new HDX would allow for downloading prime movies and TV shows I thought it would be fantastic. I use the Kindle for reading alot and also for watching the movies and TV episodes while exercising. So I thought with the new HDX and being able to download the prime TV/movies, it would be perfect for those hotels which have very poor wifi in the fitness room and I could also watch movies/TV on the plane.Well, watching the movies and TV shows are much better than the HD, but it comes at a cost, and to me it's a big cost. The reading experience on the new HDX is terrible. The blue/purple line is definitely noticeable, not only when reading but also on anything with a white background, including email and web pages. This is not actually a major problem for me but I can see how some people would find it distracting. My major issue with the HDX is the color of the backgrounds while reading. As noted in some previous reviews, the black background is not black, it's grey but my biggest problem is the white background. It's not white, it's off white/light yellow. When comparing to an iPhone/iPad and even the previous HD, it definitely has a yellow tint. The fact that it's a little bit of a yellow background wouldn't be such a big deal, but it's blotchy. Most of the screen will be a yellowish color while there are small sections that are the bluish white color. I notified Amazon of this and they sent me out a new one but the new one was actually worse than my original. The \"blotchiness\" was larger and the yellow color was more noticeable. Plus, the blue/purple color was more noticeable as well. I also went to Best Buy to look at the HDXs and the yellow color was on those as well. This yellow color in a lighted environment is subdued, but when you're reading at night in bed with the lights off, the yellow color and blotchiness is very noticeable.Another disappointment is the battery power. The battery doesn't last anywhere near as long as the HD. As I said, I read alot and before with the HD I could go weeks without having to recharge which was great with the amount I travel so I wouldn't have to bring the cords because I could just recharge back at home. However, with the HDX, I have to recharge every 3-4 days which means I have to bring the cords with me when I travel.The Mayday feature is NOTHING like they show on TV. The video is not very clear and the audio is very delayed. The service reps also don't know anything other than telling you to reset the device and then if that doesn't work, someone will call you back on the phone, thereby not even using the Mayday feature.Also, the screen on the HDX is no better in the sun than the HD, which I was led to believe it would be better. Not sure if this was a misunderstanding on my part, but it's not better than the HD. In comparison with the iPad (mini), the iPad is way better to read in the sun and I don't mean just a little better, but way better.I'm just very disappointed. I've never had any problems with Amazon before but it just seems they didn't think things through on the HDX. The Kindle has always been a great reading device, so it seems they wanted to improve the viewing experience for games and movies/TV to be better than Apple. But they did it at the expense of the reading experience, which is a big disappointment for those of us that like to read.I could continue asking for new HDXs, but what's the point? I've already seen 4 and they've all had this problem, and the replacements could be worse than the original like my one replacement already was. Do I go back to the HD? If I do that I lose the ability to download the prime TV/movies which is a great feature. Do I get a Kindle paper white for reading? Well, then I have to carry 2 tablets with me which is ridiculous. Should I purchase the 8.9 inch which supposedly doesn't have some of these issues? Well, the 8.9 inch is bigger, bulkier, heavier and more expensive and space/weight is a premium with the amount I travel. Do I begin using my iPad mini? Then again I lose the ability of the prime downloading. So I guess I'll keep the original HDX and hope Amazon addresses the reading issues on the next upgrade, but with the way they've been responding with these issues on the HDX, it seems like they don't think the issues are a problem.So, if you'll primarily use the 7 inch HDX for gaming, and viewing videos, you'll probably really enjoy it. However, if you plan to read a lot on the HDX, this is probably not the device for you.", "Date": "January 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very Impressive", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"jlambert1982\"", "ReviewID": "RML3THOX9TJ06", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros:The size.  I have an original iPad and an 8.9 Fire HD from last year.  I never thought I'd be want the smaller size, but this is perfect.  I no longer play games on my phone, b/c this thing is easy enough to carry around I take it everywhere.  In fact, if I didn't use my phone's hotspot to give this thing connectivity I would consider dropping my phone all together and using this thing to make calls from.The screen.  This thing looks amazing.  A co-worker has the new iPad Air. Side by side we both think this little guy blows it out of the water.  We pull up the same images from google and it is easy to see the difference.The performance.  My biggest complaint about the 8.9 Kindle Fire HD was that it was laggy.  Pulling up apps would take too long compared to my Galaxy S 4 or my son's iPod touch.  Apps would crash before they opened.  Videos would stall between clicking play and the video actually playing.  This little powerhouse has eliminated almost all of that.  Apps still crash, but I'll get to that later.Cons:Storage.  I live on a farm.  Beyond satellite and cell coverage I have no options for high speed internet.  I do get LTE where I live, but that is on a limited basis, and my satellite broadband has a data cap as well.  It would be nice to download season's of television while I am at work or travelling and store them on my device.  64GB seems like a lot, but between apps, books, audiobooks, and HD video, it still fills up fast.  A 128GB version would have been worth it to me.Video output.  On my Kindle Fire HD I could bring an HDMI cable with me wherever I went, and as long as there was free HDMI input on the television, I could watch my videos.  Now I have to watch through my PS3 (which I could already do with Amazon Instant Video) or the newer Samsung televisions (but not my 2011 55 inch LED).  Kind of frustrating.  Even my kid's iPod Touch has HDMI out with an adapter.App availability.  I love Amazon App Store.  It is a lot easier to navigate than Google Play, and you don't have the multitude of worthless apps.  However, there are tons of apps that I use on my phone that just are not available through Amazon.  I use Google Voice to check voicemails and send messages.  While I can do that through the Silk browser, why can't I have that option?  Everyone I know who owns a Kindle Fire has their own personal complaint about an app they can't use.Summary:I love my HDX.  To me, this is the perfect size for a tablet, and this thing performs like a monster.  It has replaced all my other tablets.  I still have a very large library of movies and TV shows in iTunes, and it continues to grow b/c of my wife's love of her iPhone and my kid's reliance on their iPods, so I can't just shut down my iTunes account yet.  For me personally, however, I'll never have to use iTunes again.  Everything this device is supposed to do, it does great.  It is a great e-reader.  It is a great video player.  It is a great music player.  I started reading comics again when I bought the 8.9 inch Fire HD last year because of how great that device was for the comic book format.  The 7 inch HDX is just as good.  Note taking, game playing, time killing.....You name it, this device does it.Right now I don't know who I wouldn't recommend this to.  Thinking about spending 150 bucks on your kids and buying them a LeapPad Ultra?  Spend the extra money up front and get them a device that is worth the money in the long run.  Between the free apps and device quality, that is a no brainer.Have grandparent who watches old TV channels and reads books?  Give them this and tell them to pay for Prime, and cancel their cable bill.My only complaints are minor.  I knock off one star because I don't like the idea of being locked into their ecosystem of apps.  That is very Apple of them, and while I understand the business to it, I still don't appreciate it.  If I could make any improvements, I wish Amazon would let me import my library of videos from iTunes to their cloud like they did my music.  If they could make that happen, I would be a fully converted form .mac fanboy.Buy without hesitation if you are a Prime member or just starting your digital video library.  I would hesitate slightly if I had thousands invested in iTunes videos and apps, but even then, for $230, it may be worth it just to see if you like it better.", "Date": "December 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice tablet but still room for improvement", "Author": "Brian", "ReviewID": "R398UH9UFG0YA1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've previously owned one other tablet -- the iPad 1.  I received it as a birthday present ~3 years ago, and sold it last year back to Apple as part of their buyback program.  I liked the iPad, but found it slightly too heavy, wide, and slow (after upgrading iOS).  The screen resolution also was subpar compared to modern standards.Fast forward to today and I've dove head-first back into the tablet world with the 7\" Kindle Fire HDX.  All of my complaints stated above are no longer apparent with the Kindle Fire HDX.  It is light, narrow (can easily grip with one hand, although not as narrow as the Nexus 7), and whip-fast.  Screen resolution is as crisp as they come.My biggest complains are that (1) the ads are semi-annoying, and (2) the whole \"user experience\" appears to revolve around the consumer buying a bunch of stuff from Amazon.  With the Nexus 7 or iPad, there is less emphasis on \"buying stuff\" and more emphasis on \"doing stuff\" (e.g. a less commercial experience).Still, for the price ($179 on Cyber Monday), I can't complain too much.  I will say, though, that depending on the promotion at the time, if the Nexus 7 and Kindle HDX are the same price, I'd probably actually prefer the Nexus 7 for a more traditional tablet experience.

I expected to only use it as an e-reader, but it turned out to be one of our best electronic purchases ever.  That Kindle went with us to many interesting places over the years.  It's small enough to fit easily in a purse or a hotel safe, so it was our family's take-along device when traveling. With the reasonable price and small size, it was perfect for trips.  Free game apps keep the kids entertained on a rainy day of a beach vacation, not so expensive (compared to an iPad) that you worry about it being stolen when it's in the hotel room or broken while sneaking in one last roller coaster ride before heading to the Orlando airport.  The Acrobat Reader app allowed me to take hundreds of pages of work-related reading material with me to Europe without having the extra weight in my suitcase.  I read a lot, and my local library has thousands of books available to borrow for e-readers, a very nice supplement to the ones I've purchased for Kindle.  The untimely death of the previous Kindle was my fault: I dropped it, glass-side down, onto a ceramic tile floor and the glass shattered.  It's still working, but now in a plastic freezer bag so I don't get (more) glass shards in my fingertips.Now that I know what my Kindle needs are (50% reading, 50% apps and web surfing), I chose the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" as the replacement.  I  considered the iPad and iPad Mini, but this Kindle has more features and better resolution for a lower price.  I also looked at the larger Kindle Fire, but I really need my e-reader to fit in one hand, so the larger size is a disadvantage.  We own Apple products, so it's not like we avoid them, Kindle Fire HDX 7\" better suits my needs as an e-reader and tablet.Several things have been upgraded on this one compared to the earlier model.  My favorite is the ability to categorize books.  I have a pretty big library already on the cloud, still working on downloading and sorting through the books.  The screen resolution is better, not meaningful for reading but great in combination with Amazon Prime movies and apps.  I haven't had reason to use the camera yet, so no comments on that.  I also haven't tested the battery life on this one, but on the previous version I found that the battery lasted much longer when the wi-fi was turned off.I am very happy with this new Kindle.  The screen size allows great portability and it can be held in one hand, not too much bigger than a paperback.  Battery life is fine, screen resolution is beautiful  Available apps are great.  This time around I also purchased an Otterbox case, so I hope to not have another review to write anytime soon.", "Date": "April 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "KINDLE rocks.

The Dolby sound quality from the speakers is phenomenal for so small a device, but the volume level doesn't go very high and at its top volume it is only what I would consider as being barely satisfactory.  If there is any background noise at all you will have problems hearing it unless you are using earphones or a headset.  My biggest complaint about the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" is the location of the on/off button and the volume control. Both of these controls are under the sloped edge of the pad and if you have a leather cover for your Kindle Fire you pretty much have to remove it from the cover to access these controls.  I think the unit would be better if the control switches were on the edge like they had with the old B&W; 7\" Kindle with the keyboard.  I'm finding that to get a nice leather cover like want I am having to have one custom made.  One other item that I think would make the Kindle Fire HDX better would be a USB port that allows you to use a Flashdrive with it.  This would allow you to access movies and documents from an external source without having to use a computer to transfer them via a cable.  I have a lot of movies on DVD's that I wanted to view on my Kindle Fire HDX 7\" when I travel, I was able to find a program to convert them to MP4 format, but I discovered that when stored in the \"myflix\" folder on the Kindle I need to use the PHOTO selection on the Kindle to find them and not the movie selection, this is rather confusing especially since no instructions came with the Kindle.  Once you get over these slight inconveniences the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" is a fun and useful media reader.", "Date": "April 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Replacment", "Author": "Frank Butts", "ReviewID": "R3N6NLPHPG99ZX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The wife finally wore out the old fire so it was time for an upgrade,  got to say I'm envious of the new HDX,  Just might have to get one for me.", "Date": "April 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice Upgrade", "Author": "Tiffany", "ReviewID": "R1VXVERD00AI3P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had the old first kindle fire, that I got in 2012, no HD, bulky, and kinda heavy after I got this new one.

I took it with me to the lake over the weekend and didn't have to charge it once over the weekend. I only used it at night, and a few times during the day. It also charges pretty fast compared to the other kindle fire.  I also love that I can have my gmail, hotmail and pop3 emails set up on my kindle. The camera works well.

Now the reason I wanted the smaller screen was because when I read my books I want to really feel like im reading a book sized object which is a better fit for me and makes a difference in my reading. This dissapointed me alot because I spend alot of extra money to pay for the 32 GB to take pictures on it but I cant really take any pictures of use with the front facing camera. The rear facing camera would make my 32BG purchase choice more useful. SO that was extremely dissapointing.  #2 when playing games on my kindle about 50% of the time the game will start flashing slightly but enough to really annoy me and make me think that something might be wrong with my device. But when calling mayday I was basically told to just call them back if it happens again but in reality it doesnt matter because of course you would have to catch it at the right time in order to show the may day people what you're talking about. The flashing that happens during the game is a random act and not something that can really be shown unless catching it at the right time which is unlikely.other than those two things, I really love my kindle as I do amazon but the two issues stated above really bug me since I really support amazon and have probably influenced 7 people at this point to buy Kindles as well as the prime membership within the past few years and probably only felt maybe 80% satisfaction from my current kindle.", "Date": "April 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "It's hard for me to get the hang of some of the basic functions.

All of the Fires have some flaws, that is to be expected.  BUT and heres the BIG BUT.  The fire, first and foremost is supposed to be for reading.  If it does not do this one simple thing well then why have it?  The blue ring literally hurt my eyes, to the point that I had to set on on dark mode to read.  Why have a Reader that hurts to read?  Every one that I have ever seen reviewed had this same issue. I figured that \"they\" were all being picky.  No sir, it was horrible.  I couldnt watch movies either because on any screen that was white, there was that blue tint.  In the end I returned it and am now using the first gen HD7.

Silk (the browser) can stumble from time to time but gets going again quickly. No issues with games hanging (and they look beautiful). Wi-fi is good - nothing great but pretty reliable and good range. Battery life is solid. It doesn't last all day with heavy use, but it will keep you entertained for a while.

Both through the Amazon Prime option and through the Netflix app. I haven't had any problems with the internet connection. The picture is fantastic. Battery life is great (I can watch like 8 hours at least of video without worrying about charging). I see none of the blue color or whatever that some people say they have. I do play some Angry Birds on it sometimes, and that's great, too. Much better than playing on an iPod, anyway. I wouldn't really want to read on it due to the brightness of the screen (that's why I have a Kindle Touch for reading). I don't really do audiobooks on it either (I have an iPod for that), but it's nice to know I have the option and that it synchs right in with my Audible account. I've used the web browsing a bit, and that's been fine, but it's not a major feature for me.Basically, I wanted it for video watching, and it's been great for that.

Cook", "ReviewID": "R2XQWM0FEHYNPA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I ordered this Kindle as a Christmas gift for my spouse.  I usually do very thorough research before ordering online but I messed up on this one.  With all the hype about the HDX, I assumed it would include GPS.  My lowly ASUS has it so why wouldn't the much hyped HDX?  Otherwise, it has some nice features but I just have a hard time getting past this major shortcoming.  The video is very good, audio is better than on the ASUS but I prefer headphones to the built in speakers on any tablet.  Processing speed is pretty good but perhaps the most impressive feature is the \"Mayday\" live help.  I've only needed it a couple of times but when you need it, it's there and I was very impressed with the quick response time and the knowledge of the operator.Not a big deal to me but another standard feature on my ASUS Transformer that's missing here is an HDMI connection.  It does have Bluetooth. Wireless is a little stronger than the ASUS. This tablet also lacks a memory card slot and a rear facing camera, both of which are included on the ASUS Transformer.Other than the lack of GPS, the most irksome thing is that you're pretty much locked into Amazon for content.  Many things I would get for free on Google are not free or not available on Amazon. Oh, and did I mention, unless you get the more expensive 4G version, THIS UNIT DOES NOT HAVE GPS?!  GRRRR!  The ASUS GPS works without a wireless connection as long as you load your maps and select your route while connected to a network and keep the tablet powered up.  Even if you have the 4G version of the HDX, I would not assume that GPS will work without a 4G connection.  Otherwise, why would GPS only be available with 4G?Revision 3/27/14: The Bluetooth is picky about what it will pair with. Can't connect with my Samsung mobile headset. It is also extremely picky about wired headphone jacks. Some work sporadically but many don't work at all. Some only get mono even though they give me stereo with other devices (like my computer or my ASUS tablet). So far the only headset I've found that works reliably and really well is a (fairly pricey) Sony Walkman in-ear headset with headband.  I've also had my first poor experience with Mayday since I first posted my review. It took a very long time to finally be told that the tablet is not compatible with my Samsung Bluetooth headset. To sum up, I don't doubt this device is very good for reading books but that's not what I bought it for. It's pretty adequate for web browsing but lacks several features that are standard on many if not most Android tablets, many of which are less expensive. If I had it to do over I'd probably opt for the smaller (less expensive) companion to my ASUS Transformer.", "Date": "March 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "great buy for anyone", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3CA70OZ41J0W5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Awesome holds a great charge for battery easy and simple to use anyone can use it lightweight and fun great buy", "Date": "March 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1ODI2KL0Q7YAJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What can I say about this device.

I'm not sure how they do it but the sound and volume on this thing is incredible.  The keyboard has swipe built in and it works well plus I also like the ease of adding new words to the dictionary. The ability to add your own words to the dictionary is incredibly useful for customizing your Kindle Fire to be adapted to your personal way of thought and speech. If you are a member of Amazon Prime the Kindle Fire is a one stop experience for shopping, books, games, and video. The real problem is in the limited OS that Amazon has created to push its app store.  This could cause problems for people who are, like myself, used to the full access of the Google Play store which you cannot use. This also means that apps that are free on Google Play might cost you money on the Amazon store. This tablet also doesn't have flash along with all modern Android and Apple products. Flash is available on Windows tablets if that is something you need. Gaming seems to work well except for some second screen features, like Battlefield's Commander app, on my Xbox One. Second screen does allow me to use the Kindle Fire as a keyboard and mouse for the Xbox One which makes surfing the web and navigating menus much easier.

I'm so sick of searching message boards every time I have a problem with an electronic device or electronic service of some sort.  When web-based technology works well, it is amazingly convenient, but when there is a problem with something you've come to depend on, it is so hard to get help.  Especially with a 2 year old tugging at your...everything.  However, the Mayday feature of my new kindle is fantastic.  To have a person who can hear your voice answer your questions immediately, and solve your issue within seconds is just invaluable to this busy mom.  No more email back and forth conversations with customer service reps that didn't read the entirety of my message or didn't answer my question fully, necessitating a problem solving session lasting for days.  A person and a voice that can respond immediately is a breath of fresh air.  I would have given the Kindle HDX 3 or 4 stars before using Mayday (mostly because I prefer the Mac look but and feel and probably should have bought an ipad mini) but this service is just so impressive and beats having to go to a genius bar and wait in line for 45 minutes or more that I'm completely sold on the Kindle.", "Date": "March 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome!", "Author": "Eva \"Eva\"", "ReviewID": "R1UIHN524VIQII", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I absolutely love it!

Maybe even increase the cost of the device. This, in turn, would likely cause customers to become more unhappy then they are with just the current approach, and at both \"store\" owner companies.I wonder if I could send my current device in to \"upgrade\" it's storage, or 4G capability, or to remove its adds, or something else at some point in the future for less than the cost of buying a new one, but I guess that is something to ask Amazon directly or look into on my own to see if such a thing exists.Anyway, I love my KFHDX7. Works great, has a good battery life, the screens colors are wonderful. The one I bought has a good screen size. It came with a good charger. The charger is one thing I absolutely love right now. It is, essentially, a wall plug in with a USB port. I can use any USB to mini USB cord to charge it, and the cord it came with can plug into the charger or my computer with no problem. I remember getting the charger for the Gen One Kindle Fire and having to go out and buy my own USB to mini USB cord in order to transfer files manually (instead of by email) or use my computer to charge it and that was something I found relatively disappointing.

First, it doesn't give one the entire 64 gb. This is normal as formatted memory systems go, but where the misleading part comes in is that these also use storage memory for operating memory. Thus, when I downloaded so much that I only had 4 or 5 gb left, the device froze up and took forever to play streaming videos and execute files. This means that you don't get the entire memory block for storage, but that you must reserve a considerable amount of it just to operate the bloody thing!When it first began to bog down, I asked the Mayday people for assistance. They led me through a litany of things which did no good. Then when they suggested resetting the device, I asked if it would remove any of my content. No, absolutely not, they said. So I reset the device and the movies began streaming without a hitch. Great! Only when I went to my on device video library, everything I'd downloaded was gone -- almost 50 gigs of data! So I downloaded everything again and now my system barely moves.The video experts told me I should be able to fill my entire storage, but this isn't apparently true. Thus, when you buy a quality Android device that has 8- or 16-gb of memory with a storage of up to 64 gbs with an SD card,  you're getting a better system memory-wise. As far as the video help, out of five calls, three were with people who spoke such poor English that communication was all but impossible. If I'd had a heart attack while on the phone with them and needed their help, I'd be dead.If this device had an SD slot, this thing would get a raging 5-star review. But tech support is wanting, my memory is only about two-thirds of what I was expecting, and this thing isn't that fast. It requires a lot of memory, and that memory comes from the storage, regardless of what I'd been told. You may want to skip this until Amazon gives truthful specifications.

From a hardware perspective the HDX is outstanding and an attractive alternative to the Nexus 7 if you don't need GPS, NFC or wireless charging. On smaller tablets I prefer the Kindle form factor as I find it easer to hold in any orientation without worrying about accidental screen touches/activations. When purchased I assumed root access and perhaps an alternative ROM would eventually be needed. Turns out a different launcher (Apex or Nova) and a few side loaded apps from 1Mobile were all that was required. Didn't even need to root my HDX which technically voids Amazon's warranty. The \"Mojito\" operating environment is more flexible than earlier Amazon/Fire ROMs; most Android apps run perfectly with exception to the Play store (admittedly a biggie) and some Google creations. I can live without those. And I still have easy access to Prime movies and a few native Amazon apps that I happen to prefer.

I did a LOT of research before I made my purchase and decided that this Kindle was the best fit for me. I was not disappointed!There are a few drawbacks:1. No SD card slot so on-board memory is all you get. This isn't a problem for me, since I don't have a whole lot of apps and cloud storage is available. (LOVE the cloud storage!!)2. Google apps are not supported. Reportedly people have gotten them to work on their Kindle but I wasn't able to get them going. I adapted - I get my Gmail via browser and use an alternate mapping app.3. Battery life isn't quite what I'd like, but manageable.Now for the pros:1. The size and weight is just right. It is comfortable to use - even hours on end like I do2. Clear, sharp images. I was quite impressed by how good things look on the Kindle Fire3. Cloud storage so if you get overloaded with apps or books, you can save them to the cloud for later retrieval4. A wide variety of apps will run on the Kindle Fire, ranging from games to Office apps.Once I got the Kindle Fire, I realized that I'd underestimated how much I'd use it. I not only use it for reading (which I do a lot!), but I also have Skype on it, several games, and a bunch of work-related applications. I use it to do some work-related tasks when it's not convenient to be at my computer. With the apps I've collected, I can do all of my work - even work that requires VPN -  on the Kindle - it's that good!I'll admit that the Kindle Fire is not for everyone. If you are expecting a full-blown tablet, you may not like this. It's total overkill if all you want to do is read books. If you absolutely MUST have the SD card slot or MUST run Google apps, then you should look elsewhere.

Secondly, the camera is a big disappointment unless you do nothing but selfies as it does not have a back camera. On the upside it is easy to navigate, the screen colors are very vivid and Amazon does offer a lot of apps, some I just find useless or don't want to install.

Good luck getting the cursor to go where you want it to when typing. Fourth, it's not easy to switch between apps. The OS stores everything in memory and the performance suffers if you use too many apps, and there's no way to close the ones you aren't using. I found myself shutting it down and restarting frequently. Fifth, a big selling point was the \"one free rental book a month\" deal with the kindle. But the selection is SMALL and it's impossible to search the lending library. Amazon sells the \"lending library\" hard, but it's clear it's not ready for primetime. Finally, some of my favorite websites are slow and glitchy with the silk browser (like slate).  The browser often hangs for no reason, even when my broadband is working fine.More rrestarting.", "Date": "February 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "It was a gift for my mom, but I love it too....", "Author": "Cujodu", "ReviewID": "R30793MZ9FXM1X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It was a gift for my mom, and a replacement for her original kindle.

One in three times it will work. What I do like is when it does work it's pretty accurate as far as words. I guess I am somewhat disappointed because we have an IPad and there is no comparison between the two. (In my opinion anyway) the iPad is a lot easier to navigate around on, speech to text always works as well. The touch sceen on the iPad also works a lot smoother and is more accurate. They say the android system is getting the bugs worked out and works as well as Apple.

The Silk browser is a huge leap forward from the Kindle Fire and is very fast and responsive. The only con I have found so far is in the native e-mail application.  It works extremely well but it does not have a \"select all\" option when you need to move or delete e-mail, you have to select each one individually.

Its fast, lightweight & portable, has an ever-growing selection of apps, and a BEAUTIFUL 7\" display. To show what this tablet is like, I will be comparing the HDX to the iPad Air(NOTE: these opinions come from a hardcore Apple user who is trying out Android-based tablets. I'm not being biased)\u00bb\u00bb Contrary to what most people believe, the HDX is actually better than the Air. For starters, the iPad air base model is $499... the HDX on the other hand, is $229. Its $270 for a tablet that isn't as powerful.\u00bb\u00bbSpeaking of power, let's take a look at the specs of the devices. The HDX has a 2.2 GHZ quad core Snapdragon processor + 2 GB of RAM. Thats more power and speed than most tablets on the market. The iPad Air has a dual core 1.3 GHz processor with only 1 GB of RAM. So clearly the HDX is way faster\u00bb\u00bbThe display on the HDX isn't as big as the iPad Air, despite being \"HD\". The HDX has a 1920x1200 display, and the iPad has a 1536x2048 display. HOWEVER, the pixel density isn't as high on the Air. The Air has about 264ppi and the HDX has 323ppi. So, although the display on the HDX isn't as HD, higher pixel density means sharper & clearer images. In terms of which is better, this one is really a toss-up.\u00bb\u00bbThe camera on the HDX is absolutely terrible compared to the one on the iPad air... at least on the 7\" model. The 7\" HDX lacks a rear-facing camera, and the front facing camera isn't too spectacular. Bump up to the 8.9\" HDX and you have an 8 MP rear camera that rivals the Air's 5 MP camera. If you're going for the 7\" tablet and the camera is the deciding factor, go with the Air. It has a better camera.\u00bb\u00bbBattery life is HUGE when comparing the tablets. The HDX is really good at conserving power. Amazon claims the HDX has up to 11 hours of battery life, and that really holds true. I myself have gotten even more than 11 hours of battery life. The iPad Air is a different story. Although Apple claims to have up to 10 hours of battery life, iOS 7 is a huge battery killer. I would be lucky to get half that amount with average use. I have a feeling that if iOS 7 was fixed to be less battery consuming, the Air would win this battle. So this is yet another win for the HDX\u00bbAesthetics & looks: Apple is known for its amazing product build quality and sleek look. The iPad wins this one hands down. It has a finished aluminum case that comes in two colors: Gray and Silver. The Air is also really thin & lightweight + it has small bezels allowing for more room for your content. It overall feels really solid. The HDX, though has a fairly sturdy build, is made with materials that look rather cheap. It has a rubbery-material back + is made with plastic... not aluminum. Although the HDX is also really thin & light, the iPad wins this one, simply because it looks nice.\u00bb\u00bbApp selection & software: The Amazon Appstore continues to grow, and certainly has thousands of more apps than it did when it first opened. But nothing can beat Apple in this category. The Amazon AS is rather limited. Its different from Google Play, which has much more to select from. Apple's AS has a huge variety of apps... overall a great selection. Amazon is just way too limited at this point in time. Also, iOS 7 is much nicer & has way more features than Fire OS 3. Fire OS takes the stock Android and modifies it to the point that it just looks terrible. You can't change backgrounds, you have very little customization, and the gray, drab colorless home screen & menus really don't help. Another hands down win for Apple.Overall, the HDX beats the Air in terms of speed, power, price & battery life. However, if you want a tablet that has more app selection, a nicer-looking OS, a good camera, and a really solid build that is aesthetically appealing, get the iPad Air.

Handy for checking emails, forums, and such, and very easy to use.

It's ridiculous the amount of functionality you lose not being able to access those apps.  If I could link this thing to my Verizon phone, and have all my Play store apps on this thing, it would've got 4 1/2 stars instead of 3.  Very disappointed that I have to hack this thing to be able to use it to it's potential.  And before you go all \"read about it before you buy it\" on me - I received this as a gift.  I had no choice in the matter...The other 1/2 star it's lacking is an easy fix, and it flat boggles my mind that Amazon didn't include it in the programming  -  NO HAPTIC FEEDBACK OPTIONS?????????  That's basic, kindergarten-level stuff some programmer left out, and it's beyond annoying.  Really would make this thing much more user-friendly if these buttons gave me some feedback when I touched them.So overall,  3 stars.  I'd be fine with recommending it as a purchase, just do your research first and make sure you can do without your Play Store apps.

The new Fire is harder to read a book on because of the glare of the pages.  Much prefer the old one's easy on the eyes screen.  I don't like the dictionary at all.  You have to page through from a to z to find the word you want.  Waste of time.  I don't much care for the games that are available.  I like word games.  I play several every day such as crossword and Scrabble on my old Kindle.  The choice of games on Fire are mostly juvenile ones with sound effects which are irritating and most of them will only let you play a game or two without paying the company who created them more money.  On the old Kindle you pay for a game up front and play to your heart's content.  I also don't like how frequently it needs recharging - even when it's just sitting around doing nothing it needs a recharge in no time.  I do like that I can pick up my email without starting up the computer. I can check it while I'm sitting around watching TV, etc.  However, you can't trash the email on your computer from your Fire, so you end up trashing it from the Kindle, then when you get into your computer, the emails are still there and you have to go through the process again..  I also don't like the front only camera.  It's very hard to take a decent picture with it because you can't see what you're focusing on.  Perhaps going up to the next level would have been better, but that was a great deal more expensive.  I'd say this is an okay device if you like to play the games a lot, don't use the dictionary very much, either don't read a lot of books or have young eyes.

She likes her Paperwhite Kindle very much, but when I had one, I did not care for it.  I borrowed my Granddaughter's first generation Kindle Fire and liked it, so bought a first generation Kindle Fire HD.  I liked the concept, but had so much trouble with failures with them (I had and sent back 3 of them), that I got to know the tech support people pretty well.  I kept the last Fire HD I had since it semi-worked.  Finally, however, with much trepidation (and a $50 one day price drop) I purchased the new Kindle Fire HDX.  It has proven perfect.  It has not crashed nor given me blank pages or any of the myriad problems I had with my Fire HDs.I had read of complaints with blue/purple borders on the HDX, but I did not see it with mine.  My wife said she saw a faint blue tinge at the edges, but it was not bothersome.  I use my HDX almost exclusively for reading and I prefer the black background with white printing so blue/purple borders are not an issue anyhow.I think if you have been disappointed with the first generation Fire HD you will be pleased with the HDX, at least as an E-reader.", "Date": "January 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "i love it", "Author": "Melissa Kay Krause", "ReviewID": "R15G94MN9Y8O2Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is great.

One of the first things I tried to do was download the User Guide - so far, I have been unsuccessful - it has simply taken too long and it times-out. It seems reasonable that there should be an easier (faster) way.  While I am computer \"literate\", it has been slow finding my way around all that the HDX offers.One of the reasons I selected the HDX was the availability of the Skype App.  When I installed it, however, Skype advised that they were blocking my account - because of a break-in that occurred in 2010. Everything was resolved by Skype and my bank, and I have been using Skype on my desktop ever since.  Working with Skype to unblock my account was endlessly frustrating.A minor point. I have used Every Word: Crossing on a previous Kindle.  I expected to use it on the HDX. However, after searching the Kindle website, I finally determined it was not compatible with the HDX. Subsequently, I purchase (it was free) the App Every Word - and received confirmation.  However, it was never delivered.  Your helpful tech determined that (again) it was not compatible with the HDX.  Not a crises - just a bit irritating.I have not yet used the Amazon Assist feature yet - but I think the offering is excellent.In one of the reviews I read before selecting the HDX, the reviewer commented that the On/Off button was in an awkward place - I agree.Thank you for the opportunity to comment.", "Date": "January 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Mayday", "Author": "murray johnson", "ReviewID": "R1RS3YKKPJ40QA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just wanted to give a little praise to the Mayday people.

All have been a pleasurable experience, but this HDX has exceeded all my expectations by far!  I was reluctant to get it as I only expected a software update and a few added gizmos.  I had hoped they would include another camera on it too, but no.What pushed me over the edge in purchasing it was a $50 coupon sent to me as a Prime customer, plus the knowledge I could sell my older HD Fire and recoup even more of the purchase price so it seemed to be worth a major software upgrade, all by itself.WOW!  Holy computational power, Batman!!!  I am more than delighted with this 7\" HDX!  The total difference between the older Fire HD generation one and this Fire HDX is amazing!  Incredible value here!  My only regret is that it doesn't support Flash, but neither did the HD unless you sideloaded Dolphin, and for the most part I can do without having Flash on it.  I do hope a software upgrade will enable Flash videos on it, and soon, but with the outstanding performance and speed of the HDX as it is, I can live without having Flash.  Besides, what a lot of people don't realize is, if you use any other OS (in order to view Flash) rather than the Amazon version, you lose all the great benefits of Amazon's cloud loading and storage, which is part of the reason for it's speed and super flexibility.This HDX is a true world-beater.  I can't imagine what even newer models could provide in addition except another camera on the 7\" model.  I have not used the Mayday help feature, but since I've used Fires from the very beginning I'm used to handling the OS.  I can see where the Mayday help feature could be absolutely invaluable to a beginning purchaser, though.

I think we have to put all these tablets in perspective. I also have a 8.9\" Nook HD+. So, much as been said about the Kindle that I had to buy one to see for myself is it all that it is said to be. I like the Kindle because of its size and portability. One of the main reasons that I can really enjoy my Kindle is because it has been rooted. This means that not only do I have access to Amazon content, I also have access to the Google PlayStore. This is important to me in order to be able to enjoy ownership of a Kindle.With it being rooted I can enjoy both worlds. The Kindle is a fantastic tablet, but in my opinion only if it is rooted. I don't like proprietary software and if you keep it with Amazon's offers, ecosystem it gets really boring quick. I am a Prime and Netflix member, so this tablet is great. I am able to fit it inside my purse and travel with it with no problem. However, the only reason I can enjoy it to this point is because it is rooted. It is a beautiful tablet and I really like everything it can do.Pros: affordability, portability, fast and efficient software (speedy), beautiful display resolution, versatile (if able to root), impressive device (makes me want the 8.9\" just can't justify the purchase since I have a Nook of the same size)Cons: no way to expand memory, no HDMI ouptput, proprietary software, having to pay to stop special offers", "Date": "January 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "I LOVE it!!", "Author": "Barbie", "ReviewID": "R13C13DT45WADG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Beautiful display, lightweight, no problems with using it immediately.

I also have saved pdf docs of patterns and tutorials on it. My HDX works beautifully, in the standing case, on my jewelers bench for various metalworking guides and for offline use.In my kitchen, the HDX is  a recipe book,  with recipes from the internet via wifi as well as files saved offline.Basic Pros -- The images & sounds are  crisp and clear,  which is a significant improvement over the original Kindle Fire.- Easy to use & navigate for the slightly less tech savvy (I'm an art geek not a techno geek and comfortable with Apple products.)- Kid friendly, my 2 yr old niece and 8 yr old nephew enjoyed an interactive story on it as well as the usual kid games and apps.- A lot (1000's) of free Kindle books, lower priced reads, samples, and the Prime lending library for a monthly freebie.Basic Cons --My 64gb 7\" model doesn't  have  a rear facing camera but it's not enough of a con to knock a star off. I use a DSLR for my art pics and my iPhone 5s for my out-and-about snapshots, so using the HDX for an occasional selfie or web chat is  great.-The battery life isn't as good as it was on the old original Kindle Fire.

Lee Jr.", "ReviewID": "R6MZ952XAW42Q", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Normally I am an Apple guy.  The Kindle Fire HDX 7\" wooed me because I am a Prime member and most websites inclined that it's almost absurd to not look at the Kindle Fire HDX if you are one. I was offered a free trial and enjoyed the 32GB model thoroughly.  The apps I could get were fun and watching videos looked great.The features, look and feel were great.  I was saddened to be limited by the App store and lack of Google Play access.  I find it ironic that when you turn off the limitation on app installation the warning states that foreign apps might not be trustworthy when a recent free app offered triggered people's spyware app on their Kindle Fires.  This wasn't a huge drawback to my enjoyment, but another thing Amazon needs to work on.  There was another new issue that Amazon Techs apparently don't know about.It was during my free trial I saw an odd glitch in the system with certain apps.  Apps such as Simpsons Tapped Out, Angry Birds Star Wars 2 and UNO & Friends, I saw a strobe-like light flicker on the screen.  I ignored it with my free trial Fire, but when it occurred again on the 64GB I got for Christmas I was concerned.  Thankfully it doesn't occur during any video playback.When researching the issue, I found there wasn't much.  There was only one other post on an Amazon comment board from a gentleman who revived his Fire for Christmas this year.  He posted a YouTube Video, but it's rough to see the flickering.  I found one other article giving tips to troubleshoot it and I tried them all and retried them when I used the MayDay button.The Mayday tech sent me to a kindle specialist who had me reboot and try the apps again.  He had never heard of this issue which worried me a bit.  In the end, Amazon sent me a replacement tablet.  Once again playing Angry Birds and the background starts flickering.  Not sure if there might end up being an OS update to fix it, but it's something to be aware of.It's a great device and priced incredibly for what it delivers.  The App store or app accessibility needs to be massively increased and this new screen flicker issue will hopefully be addressed.Overall, I'm pleased with my Kindle Fire to stream all my Flixster movies and Amazon Prime Videos.  There are just a few issues Amazon needs to work to really make me forget Apple's iPad.Updated 2/16/14As a Christmas gift, I can't say that I was disappointed in my purchase but after owning this since December and already going through a replacement I expected much more.  The Tech reviews made it seem like this thing could go toe to toe with the iPad but I had used iPads my family owned in the past and I've seen nothing like the issues this device has.  From repeatedly errors in apps, apps that stop opening and have to be forced closed several times in a row to the screen flickering like a strobe light (Yes the auto brightness is off).  The flickering is what led to my replacement, but immediately upon rebooting my replacement did the flickering come right back.  I led it slide because it happened in games like Angry Birds, UNO and Simpsons Tapped Out because I thought maybe the software was having a difficult time with games that pull a lot of memory.  I really shouldn't have since this is supposed to be the faster Kindle Fire and have the ability to portray graphics with great detail.  Now, apps with simple text articles like IGN are now flicking.  I'm not sure if it's their Android software but I think by next Christmas I'll trade this in for a new iPad Mini.", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "This product is on fire", "Author": "Al T", "ReviewID": "RHN3DZXIMUN4P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have an ipad 4 I bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it and I love it.

I was not impressed by it due to the unusual GUI, lack of true Android, and slow performance. I've owned every generation of iPad and type this from my 32GB iPad Air. I also own a Nexus 7 (2012).  I initially considered the HDX because of the special offers, namely the extra special ones where products are sold dirt cheap ($19 Paperwhite? Heck yeah!). But after buying the 16GB HDX 7, I changed my opinion. I ran out of space on it and returned it to order a 64GB HDX (at a much more reasonable price difference than Apple could ever dream of). I'm not ditching my iPad's anytime soon (too heavily invested in that ecosystem) but I can't stop gushing over the HDX. It's fast  the screen is crystal clear (blue tint on edges doesn't bother me), super light, and inexpensive.  I will always take it when I take a tablet rather than the iPad (which beg to be stolen). The origami case is also pretty impressive. I like how it holds on by a magnet and can easily be removed. And the folded stand is FAR more stable than the expensive leather Apple Smartcase on my iPad Air. As for the Nexus 7? It now feels far too sluggish and I hate the 16:9 aspect as well as the black bar that never goes away.

I would really love to be able to access the Google Play store and have all the apps that I have on my phone, but that simply isn't happening, and I don't know if it's something that will be happening in the future. Amazon has their custom OS over Android here, and while it is a pleasure to use (buttery smooth and easy to navigate) it sometimes left me wanting for more as my brain would connect Android with Google apps and then not find them in the Appstore. The reason I did not let this bring my rating down was mainly because of the tablet's intended use. This is an Amazon-centric tablet, and as such can be considered as a portal through which to consume Amazon's content. I signed up for a prime membership as soon as I received the tablet and it's almost a necessity. Maybe not almost, probably just is.Having a prime membership really opens the Kindle up, giving one immediate access to all of the movies and TV shows that are marked prime and allows them unlimited viewing. If you're a reader, you're offered a free book rental every month, and hey, two day shipping for free gets you your stuff faster.My model came with the special offers because it was cheaper and they aren't obtrusive or annoying in any way. They present themselves to you as a screen saver, so when you click the power button (and it has a darn good 'click') you're shown an offer, and if you don't want the offer, you simply go ahead and unlock the tablet, start using it, and forget the ad ever happened. I can think of five things right now off the top of my head that are worse than having to see a brief offer on my screen. Not that I'm adamantly for them, they simply don't, and shouldn't matter to you.As far as what you're getting for the price, your money goes a pretty long way. The specs are in line with the best of them and the hardware is beautiful. It feels like a nice piece of tech in your hands, and that in and of itself, makes me want to use it. The screen resolution is amazing and it lends itself to the quality of the device as a whole. It's as crisp and beautiful as it should be, displayed on such a high quality piece of hardware.I actually have not tried or used the \"Mayday\" feature. As someone who is familiar and adapts very quickly to new technology, it feels like more of a novelty - to me. To someone with a less of a background, it's probably awesome. I simply haven't felt the need to use it, but it's nice to know that it's there in case I suddenly forgot how to operate things, namely Amazon tablets.In conclusion, if you have some money laying around, and aren't starving, go buy a Kindle Fire; they're cool.", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great fun", "Author": "nikki horner", "ReviewID": "RK06N7FNAL6HJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Does almost everything.

He gave me the option of a Kindle or an iPad so I choose Kindle because I wanted something different; we have a few Apple products already. Unfortunately when I received the Kindle, there was an issue with the volume buttons on the back. They only worked half of the time. When they did work they were kind of glitchy and the times that they did not work, well, you would push the buttons numerous times and absolutely nothing would happen. So Amazon kindly sent me a replacement. Once again, this Kindle had a problem as well (maybe I have horrible luck?). This time the area that should have displayed AT&T; 4G and the signal bars read \"INVALID SIM\". It would not work. So I went to AT&T; and got a new sim card and it still did not work. I returned both Kindles and decided to not receive a third.Things I did like about the Kindle: I liked the size. I didn't really want a big tablet so the size of the 7 inch was perfect. I liked the back side of the Kindle. The iPad's back are metal so I see them as being more likely to slip out of your hands but the kindle's back made for a better grip. I like the display. Also, the speakers on the back of the kindle were great! It has a nice surround sound like quality.Things I did not like: the hardware issues.Overall, the Kindle itself was nice but problems with the hardware were not okay. I did not want to keep having replacements shipped to me until I found one that worked 100 percent.

As they have not drawn nearly as many developers to their store as Apple or Google.  With that said, so far it has not been an issue.  Our daughter has been able to find most all the apps she was looking for.  I think as the Kindle continues to gain traction, the developers will obviously go where the customers are.  I'm highly impressed with the device itself.  Some of the motions aren't as smooth as my Ipad, but not terribly noticeable.  It has a  very nice picture resolution.  Much better than my Ipad 2.

Although I heard goodreviews of the iPad the cost was prohibitive although the store was top notched.  Likewise, I heard good reviews about the Nexus but I was concerned with the store.  The Kindle HDX 7 delivers both as promised: inexpensive and also linked to the largest store in the world.I have had it for about a month now and it has been worth every cent I spent on it.  I love toggling it on and instantly watching movies from either NetFlix or from Amazon Prime.  Its fast and pretty.  I did once have a problem with Netflix -- it kept telling me I had no internet when obviously I did.  I reinstalled the app and never had a problem again.Reading books is great.  Clear and crips lettering and easy page turning.  Magazines I find with a mixed bag.  Essentially the composition of digital magazines has a lot to be desired about, but that has nothing to do with the Kindle.  I configured one email to its mail application and it works well, with no real complaints.  Typing on any soft key keyboard is a chore and I am thinking of getting a pen (although most I have seen are outrageously priced for a plastic stick).Not overly impressed with web surfing on this or any tablet.

Shortly after i posted this review and having been able to play with the device for a while, I returned it for a refund. I didn't understand why i couldn't find a Youtube app or Google Earth. I quickly realized that although this was an \"android\" tablet it was controlled. I looked at the IPad Mini Retina and considered buying it. But there is one factor to why i wanted a small tablet. I have a full size IPad Air which is use for every day stuff. When i want to sit back and relax or watch videos b/f i fall asleep i want a smaller tablet. I have severe heart failure that was caused by a virus. My circulation is a big factor and holding anything up for a long time results in losing feeling in my arm. An iPad Mini was out of the question.  I purchased a Nexus 7 2013 and it was amazing. It was fast and light and I could watch Youtube and use the google apps, but there is no app for access to my Amazon Prime. I was in Best Buy and walked past the Kindle Fire display and stopped for a moment. What i quickly realized was that the HDX screen and colors are more vivid than the Nexus 7. It also responded quicker. An employee that was working there asked if i needed help and I explained that this was the tablet i really wanted but there is not Youtube. You can download a \"fix\" and install Youtube but it does NOT allow you to log into the Google environment. He told me about the Youtube Video app that he said was actually better than Youtube and allowed you to log in to Google to load your subscriptions, favorites, etc. There is also an Instagram alternative app. I decided to buy it and i can tell side by side the difference in speed and color between the Kindle Fire HDX and the Google Nexus 7 2013..the Kindle Fire HDX blows it away. I have adapted to the apps that it doesn't have because i have an iPad for backup. But so far its perfect. The sound difference when listening to music is much better than the Nexus also.The perfect choice for a 7\" tablet. Remember most Android tablets don't have access to the Amazon Instant Store. Its fast, has very sharp vivid screen and images, and has all the apps you need.

I was worried whether I would get enough use out of the device to justify the cost (First tablet), but no longer.Pros:The shipping was quick and on time and the packaging was excellent.The device was received with a full charge on the battery. the charger appears to be of great quality.Camera/picture quality is great. I Skype a lot.The battery life is very good thus far. I can get about 12 hours of steady web use, 8 hours of constant streaming, and have left it idle for 3 days off charge and still had 99% battery life. I can take it to work for 14 hours with sporadic work related use and end the day with 30% battery life.The device functions smooth and quick. The processing speed is top notch.The display is so clear, HDX is great for viewing pleasure. No problems reading books in sunlight.The speakers are very clear and can get quite loud.Navigation is easy, not confusing at all.Amazon's free app of the day are usually high quality apps.Amazon also has these kindle customer only lightning deals that offer some serious value.Cons:The Device has, on 4 separate occasions, refused to respond from sleep mode. Just a black screen, like the device has been switched off, and it will not respond from pressing or holding the power button. All 4 times I got frustrated at the lack of response and walked away from it for a few hours. When I came back it worked just fine like there had never been a problem. Was not a charging issue, the battery had plenty of life left and I did not have it on charge while I let it be for a few hours.Amazon and the Google play store do not get along.  The kindle is designed to actively block any attempt to access the play store. It can be worked around of course, but it is annoying that I must do that. The Amazon app collection is not very large in comparison and leaves a lot to be desired to me.Overall it's great, I use it all the time.

So, I'll share my experience with that part in case it could be useful for someone else looking for that functioanlity.I had this for few weeks, and basically can echo many other reviewers. Excellent build quality, display, Amazon apps. If you're planning to use this device just to shop, read, watch videos on Amazon (on Kindle display) I doubt you could find anything else even close. However, if you want to output the display or sound content to an external device like a TV it all starts to go downhill. I want to highlight these issues since I could not find any details on the web (except very few).For some reason, Amazon does not provide apps such as \"Pioneer Control App\" and \"Panasonic Remote 2\". These are essential for me to control my TV and receiver from Kindle, so I could use them as a workaround for at least playing my own music/video library. To make matters worse, there's no other display output (like DLNA, through the home network). Kindle does not have an HDMI port, and the USB port does not work as a \"Slim Port\". So, I tried the \"Kindle Certified\" NetgearPush2TV. A real dissapointing experience. I wrote a separate review for that. Apparently Amazon tech support (and Netgear support) does not know much about this (I spoke with at least 4 agenrts, if I remember correctly). All Amazon agents were great, but couldn't help. So, if you plan to use the Kindle for the following then you'll be dissapointed:1. Play music from Kindle to your networked (aka connected) receiver2. Play videos (from internet/Amazon Instant Videos and from your own library) from Kindle to a networked TV3. GPS (e.g. with CoPilot) --- Kindle does not have a GPS, which I realized after buying. My bad, not whining hereA modern high-end device like Kindle should provide this sort of basic functionality, in my opinion. I was surprised to learn these limitations (the hard way). There are apps for this sort of thing (e.g. Flips/iMediaShare) but they're far from perfection with many limitations. I tried very hard to keep the Kindle and find workarounds for the limitations mentioned above but I could not. So I had to return it.Since then I bought a Nexus 7. Only problem I have is that Amazon does not allow it to access Instant videos (I knew this before I bought it but still weird, because I can use any other device and don't see how Amazon makes money by blocking it. Kindle is really cheap, so, also hard to understand how they make lot of money by selling the hardware. So, I'm confused but there must be some reason other than just Amazon/Google rivarly). I don't watch videos very often (but my son takes care of that for me with his Kindle) so it's not a huge isue for me at this point.Again, you need to read this review very carefully since I did not attempt to highlight lot of good aspects of the device since others have already mentioned those; if the extra networking/navigation/output functionality is not needed for you then the Kindle is an excellent device.", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Lovely little tablet.

I use this primarily for reading, watching videos and movies, and occasionally surfing the web, so nothing terribly extensive. It suits my needs just fine, at a lower price point and makes me feel like getting an iPad would just be overkill for me. I purchased mine with the adds included and honestly it's not a big deal. They're not intrusive with whatever I might be doing on the tablet and if it bothered me that much I would just pay the $15 to have them removed. There are some deals that are exclusive to kindle fire owners which is pretty awesome and since I use amazon quite often for purchases, I don't mind a chance at snagging a good deal. There are plenty of apps to pick from (for my purposes anyway) like Facebook, Youtube, and a few games here or there. It's lightweight and easy to hold for reading while lounging around in bed and the movies I've watch show up in beautiful quality.

I haven't owned a tablet before but I've played around on other's iPads. I feel like this tablet is very comparable to an iPad but at almost half the cost, I would pick the Kindle every time. I chose the 7\" instead of the 8.9\" because I like the smaller tablet and I personally would never hold up something so big to take a picture, especially when I have my phone or digital camera.Cons:- There is a blue/purple haze around the border of the screen that is visible on white. It actually doesn't bother me at all but it does bother some people. I don't even notice it's there unless I specifically pay attention to it. Even though it doesn't bother me, I would rather it not be there.- Battery life isn't great compared to the iPad. For the same amount of use, I'm used to charging every 2 weeks or so instead of every 3-4 days.- I don't like that the charger is plugged in at an angle instead of straight on. It's not really THAT big of an issue but it does take more effort than usual to plug it in.- This is more my fault for not reading/understanding the Prime benefits, but you only get the benefits of Prime if your account pays for it, not when you get added and another account pays for it (which completely makes sense). I was really looking forward to \"borrowing\" Kindle books for free and downloading movies to watch later offline but my husband wanted to keep paying for prime on his account and I didn't want to put my Kindle under his account or have both of us pay for Prime.Overall, I love my Kindle and it's a great tablet for the price.

My one major complaint with the device itself is that (at the time I purchased it) there was a difference of $50 to not have the \"Special Offers\" lock screen.  It sounds cool on their site to have it anyway...but....they're just advertisements on the lock screen that take up the whole page.  Soo...instead of microtransactions inside of an app to get rid of ads, you have to pay $50 more to not have these on your lock screen.  Not cool Amazon...not cool.EDIT: I purchased this on a Black Friday sale, to clarify, it is no longer $50 difference in the devices for the ad/non-ad ones, but at the time, one was on a large sale and the other wasn't...making it a large price difference.Second complaint which is also the awesomeness of this product.  With the purchase of the Kindle Fire, Kindle Fire HD, and the Kindle Fire HDX, you get free 500 coins for the app store after registering it and adding billing information.  I completed this...and 0 coins.  Soo....being curious, I used the \"Mayday\" button on there to contact support.  Due to the friendliness of the agent that responded, I found out I was only like the 10th person to use it that morning, as it's still a new feature, and the agents are new to this too!  She was EXTREMELY helpful and kind and informed me it could take a couple hours to receive this promotional credit.Last but not least...the power cable.  It is at a FUNKY angle on the tablet in order to keep with the contoured angle of the tablet edge.  It angles upward while plugged in properly.  If not careful, I can see this charging port or cable becoming damaged easily.Beyond those few issues, this is an excellent tablet, it's perfectly sized, fits well in the hand, the screen is bright (I see none of the blue tint as others are describing), and the support is phenomenal!", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Christmas Gift She Loves", "Author": "Happy Camper", "ReviewID": "R2Z48UY20WV9ED", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife already had a Kindle.

As soon as I logged in with my account all my kindle content synced up! I got the free trial so I had picked the kindle with the ads and I did not feel like the ads were bothersome at all. They mostly showed up when the tablet was in a 'sleep' status so I saw them when I was turning it back on. I even clicked on some out of curiosity since they are items I would be interested in. I did not add any extra apps so I just used what was already installed. It was a bit of a learning curve since I have been using an iPad but I was able to figure it out without much trouble. The browser is user friendly and the menus are not hard to use (once you figure out where the controls are). I mostly used it to watch movies and shows from amazon since I have Prime. I loved being able to take it around the house and not have a sore wrist! It is very light and the screen felt pretty hardy so i didn't worry about scratching the screen or the possibility of it dropping. The screen was crystal clear so I thoroughly enjoyed watching movies and shows on it ( the imdb inserts during shows and movies were a plus for me). I thought its size would be a disadvantage but it felt just like a regular size tablet. I liked that I could easily carry it in my handbag without feeling the extra weight or bulk! Battery life was decent. I was able to use it continuosly for at least 3 hours before it got critically low, although I noticed that even plugged to the wall it would somehow still be on and wouldn't be 100% charged? (could have been tks I wasn't physically turning it off during charge time) I assumed that maybe it was because ads popped up during this time. I had a hard time returning it but I wasn't quite ready to part with that amount of money right then. I still want to get one for sure!!!! So basically to sum it up, this tablet is a small, delightfully light, hardy, crystal clear, fast (in my opinion), and handy tablet. If you use Amazon a lot, it is a great tablet to have! I buy and rent e-books from Amazon, and have purchased most of my music from here too so, it was great to access all my content from it! I didn't think I would want one but after test driving it for a month now I really really do want to get one!

However, upon setting the new Kindle up I found that the maximum number of accounts possible is 4.

I own a kindle keyboard so this is a huge upgrade for me. I am a huge fan of amazon and I did plenty of research on this product before even though I knew I would love it. I am a huge fan of the kindle. For those of you that post bad ratings due to lack of apps or other stupid things is your own fault for not researching this product first. This product is a KINDLE. This is not an ipad or other kind of tablet. For a kindle this is a very good tablet. The kindle was originally made to read books and even though now it is more centered around internet usage, it is still for reading. No you will not find the same features and capabilities on this kindle as you will on another higher level tablet. For the price paid for this kindle it is truly worth it. The color is beautiful and the processor is very responsive and clear. It really is a great upgrade for the kindle. It may not be up to the same level as an ipad but for the price and the fact that it's a kindle makes it amazing. This product is for amazon lovers and those who are dedicated to amazon. I have a prime membership and I have already tested out some of the videos which are great. I also love the sound and how the volume buttons are on the back. I understand that some of you actually have received a defective tablet and that would be a good reason to give it a low rating but it is a new piece of technology so there are going to be some defective ones. As far as the blue or purple hue when reading that everyone pointed out goes, I don't know if it is different on different kindles but mine is very faint and I can hardly notice it. It is definitely not a big deal. There are too many people comparing the kindle to an ipad. No it will not have all the same apps because kindle has its own browser called silk. There however is still a lot of apps available and I assume the popular ones wouldn't be hard to find. There is also a way to sideload apps and all it takes is some research on youtube to figure out how. I am very impressed with this kindle and I understand its greatness. For those of you that hated it because you did not do your research, you should be looking in to this stuff before you buy it. Again, the kindle is for amazon lovers and those who mainly enjoy reading and surfing the web. For those of you that simply play games and want a ton of apps, a different tablet would probably be better for you. I can't wait to learn more about my kindle and experience the other great things that are yet to come.

It is difficult to use, requiring many key strokes to get it going, not to mention the necessary use of a headset.

So ..it has a fast enough processor to game and complete tasks like surf or watch a movie. Oh yeah another big thing was....reading books...this thing makes it easy to read a book....Amazon Prime and this device just works and is a huge solution for many tasks just reach down and pick it up...only thing that I would like to see is Kindles offer more harddrive space....like a 1tb...yeah we are in a time of file servers aka cloud servers...but in times of no internet...a real harddrive is a must...face it 4G/3G is a hoax, its a joke when it comes to internet so don't fall for the 4G lie and highway robbery mobile internet companies charge for internet...Amazon seriously this product and your growing services is on the right track for the future.

The only thing i noticed as something it lacked was harddrive space when the Amazon prime video offered to download the movie better quality would require more harddrive space. But this is more of need when traveling through an area where there would be no internet or limited internet. And...

But it's a great E reader.I wanted a good 7 inch tablet.  I bought a returned the Google Nexus 7.  It was great except for no browser having a reading pane which is important in a small tablet.  You would think Google would have this in Chrome but no.  The screen is the best in class.I went to Best Buy and they had the HD and HDX side by side.  I compared the internet and there was no comparison - they HDX was very fast so I bought it to try out.  Happy to report that this is now a true tablet in that the Silk browser is much improved,, the quad core makes all the difference, the internet is now very usable and fast.HDX also has improvements over the HD - you can slide up from the bottom to access recently used programs which is very important if you need to switch between apps since only Surface allows you to keep two apps open simultaneously in the tablet world.  This works better than iPad.A page from other androids - you swipe down to see email and other notifications.The power button is now accessible!Size is smaller and slimmer.Some have noticed that there is a purple haze to the background.  That's true and that's something you have to judge for yourself if it bothers you.There is a limit on the number of tabs you can open on the Silk browser.Battery life is improved over HD.  It now comes with a cable and wall charger.There is no rear camera.  If that's important to you, consider the iPad Mini.  OR you can buy a real camera for the price difference.In summary, there is really no reason to buy the HD unless the price is $100.  The HDX is now a good competitive tablet.  The app store remains a problem if you depend on apps for games.  I have found some surprisingly good specialty apps.This is smaller than the iPad Mini and almost half the price.

Since this tablet cannot yet be purchased in The Netherlands in a store, this was the only chance for me to pick it up and feel and explore it. I loved the design, the feel, the incredible clarity and mega-fast processor.Back home, I tested a lot of tablets at a Dutch local megastore. Google Nexus seemed appealing, then Samsung tab 3.0, but I disliked the shapes, too long/narrow screen proportions. LG Gpad 8.3 was another temptation, but again: that weird long narrow screen? I jumped on to Apple's Ipad Mini 2. Bigger screen than the average 7\" and just perfectly proportioned. Simply not being an Apple's type of guy, I hesitated. What held me back at Ipad Mini 2, were the limitations of dropping audio and video files on it. You would have to use Itunes for almost everything and convert many movie files.With Kindle, I wasn't sure about its Amazon-tunnel-vision strategy. But I also read there were a lot of ways to sideload apps outside the Amazon app-convent.From the day I received it (3 days after purchase, this gets UPS delivered to your doorstep and yes, they do ask your neighbours to receive it on your behalf in case you're not at home), I have not regretted this purchase for one second.I like Amazon products a lot. I do read Kindle books. But I like Kobo also. No problem, on youtube there's a perfectly clear instruction video on how to bring Kobo to your Kindle, and the two do peacefully co-exist.Magazines: lovely, cheap and easy to order, a delight to page through on this tablet.PDF files, Word documents: perfect viewing.For more extensive typing, I purchased the Perixx Periboard-805L, which works like a charm as a bluetooth wireless foldable keyboard for my Kindle tablet.Kindle Fire HDX 7 had my first attention, and remained my ultimate choice.

There are way more options. The Kindle was a fraction of the cost of the ne iPad mini retina. The screen is gorgeous. I find it the perfect size for watching movies in the hand. Amazon makes it very easy to move your music over to the Amazon ecosystem from Apple if you want to do that. For 20ish bucks a year you can move all your apple music to the cloud at Amazon. From there you can download whatever songs you want to your Kindle or just play them from the cloud. Very easy.I was initially worried about not having access to the full Android spectrum of apps. It hasn't proven to be an issue at all. It took me about 10 minutes to sidestep the Amazon store and install Chrome and Firefox. I was also able to install a flash player and can now run any flash web apps through the Dolphin web browser. I couldn't do this on my iPad.The touchscreen is very snappy with no lag at all. This processor is speedy.A big upgrade from my iPad 1. The built in speakers are also better than my iPad 1. I didn't know if I would be OK with the smaller screen bit I'm enjoying it quite a bit.

The hardware in this is powerful and easily high up comparative to other tablet-like device of this size.- Battery life is great so far.- Fantastic screen quality; reading, browsing the internet, using apps like netflix, tumblr, etc., all look fantastic- Sound is also very good, headphones and speakers both- Ads are very unobtrusive (if applicable to your kindle), only appearing on the unlock screen.- Like advertised, works straight out of the box (obviously if you have linked a previously existing amazon account to the kindle)- Big name apps from the amazon store work perfectly. Netflix, Tumblr, Pintrest, Pandora, Skype, Steam, Sonos, BBC, NPR, Twitch are some that I had no trouble quickly installing and using. The email integration is great, and the goodreads integration is absolutely fantastic.- Most of the settings and features are very intuitive, and when using for the first time there will typically be very basic, quick tutorials.- A great deal for the price.- If you own Amazon content in their cloud its a matter of seconds to access it. And if you have Prime, the kindle is a no-brainer.All in all a great device. However there are a number of limiting factors and mild annoyances that build up to a loss of a star for me.

This is useful in some ways, as you can control apps from your amazon account remotely, but also limiting in others. Compared to the Google Play store the selection is lacking. Although it should be mentioned that this may be partially be design, since there are many apps that do not work (yet) on this kindle's version of android.  Even so, apps can be side-loaded onto the device if you have basic technical know-how. For example, the Humble Bundle App works perfectly on my kindle. To be fair a lot of apps are pretty much crap, but I'd like to have the options for more, albeit mixed with some quality control.- App permissions can sometimes be downright creepy, i.e. a stupid game or simple app having access to data  that it clearly does not need to function and you would rather keep personal. I understand that this is not strictly Amazon's responsibility but rather that of the third-party developers and the owner of the kindle, but its worth mentioning here.- The placement of the only physical buttons, the power and volume buttons, isn't as intuitive as I would like. I find myself accidentally pressing the wrong ones from time to time. I suppose that I might just have to get used to them though.- I would've liked the option for a mircoSD slot, but I guess we live in the age of the ~cloud~. The 16 GB isn't really 16 GB, which is par for the course. But its even less than you might think, you only get 10.6 GB. Unless all your content is on or going to be on your amazon account, spring for the 32 or 64 GB model.- The 7\u201d version only has a camera facing you; no camera facing outwards.  Not really super important unless you want it.- The Carousel is plain stupid. This is a function that works well on other multi-touch devices, but on this kindle it just plain doesn't work well. The intended function is to quickly pick up what you had been doing previously, and for reading books this is still useful. However for everything else it isn't very. In particular if you load up things (like drm-free books via usb) they ALL appear as new on the Carousel, and you can only remove them one at a time. If there was someway to customize it, like so that everything new did not appear and you could lock in which apps you wanted to appear on it, then it might be functional, but as it is I ignore it completely unless I want to get back to the last book I was reading.- Some options for organizing books would be helpful rather than just sort by title/author/recent and displaying covers. An option for alphabetized letter sections would be nice, as well as some indication of a scroll bar to the right hand side.- One of the first things I did in my settings was turn off letting things automatically detect where I am located. I have wi-fi only, and I don't really need it on, plus nearly everything asks for it which just kind of creeps me out. But, and this is the most annoying thing, every single time an app or website requests it I get a pop-up asking me if I want to enable location-based services. Let me repeat this: Every. Single. Time. And a lot of apps will consistently ask. So at least once every 5-20 minutes, depending on what I'm using, I will be interrupted by this pop-up asking me this question even though the answer is pretty much always no. Which I thought was, you know, the point of me disabling it in the settings to begin with. I don't want to have to turn on Quiet Time all the time just to get this to stop.", "Date": "December 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Yes!!!

Also have a full-size iPad which is a great size for watching movies in bed, but really too big/heavy to play games.  The original Kindle Fire has only 8 GB storage (partly taken up by software) so I wanted another smaller tablet.  It was between the new Kindle HDX or the new iPad mini.  One thing I didn't like about the iPad mini (besides the price tag) is that the bezzle on the long sides is so narrow, it is hard to hold the device without getting your thumb on the display (which screws up games).  When I saw the HDX on sale on Cyber Monday, I grabbed it.It's fast, thin, light and easy to hold for long periods of time.  I can't believe how light it is compared to my KFire! There are several design changes, such as the ability to show the percentage the battery is charged in the little icon in the top right corner. You have to swipe down from the top of the display to access settings and other utilities.  I got the 32 GB version, so there is plenty of room for games and other apps.  I did download a Prime Instant Video to watch off-line, but I don't like the small display for watching movies.About that display -- I compared the HDX to the original Fire, looking at the same page of a book that has alot of white space on it.  White is a color, and like all colors, it can be \"warm\" or \"cool.\"  A cool white is \"bluish\", and a warm white will be a little yellowish.  When I compared the 2 kindle displays for a book, I was shocked to see something I never noticed before.  On the original Fire, the white is \"cool/bluish\" and there is yellowish tint seeping in around the edges of the pages of the book I was comparing!  This never bothered  me; as I said, I never noticed it.  On the new HDX, the opposite is true --  the color white is warm (yellowish) with the blue/purple (that so many have commented about) seeping in around the edges of the book.  I doubt that this will bother me, and I feel that the people who complained about this and sent back this beautiful little device because of it, need to get a life!  BTW, the page on the HDX doesn't look yellowish to me at all; it is only when compared side-by-side to the original Fire that you can detect the different tints to the white color.I love playing games on the HDX, as even fast running games (such as my favorite Temple Run 2) work without stalling.  And, I got Temple Run Oz (finally) which was not compatible with the original Fire.There are some design features I don't like, such as the way the charger sticks in at an angle.  But charging is very fast using the included charger. My only real issue now is the battery life.  I am currently charging it up, and I am going to see if I can get anything close to 10 hours of \"mixed use\" on it.  (Yes, there are ways to extend battery life, such as turning off wifi when not using it.  Search on the internet for other tips.)Edit about battery life:  I usually find that when products are advertised as \"up to X hours on a single battery charge (depending on settings, usage, blah blah blah)\"  I usually get half that. What concerned me about the HDX was that I had fallen asleep with the HDX unplugged, watching a PREVIOUSLY DOWNLOADED movie (a 2.5 hour movie downloaded in \"better\" quality; after it finished, the display went into sleep mode)-- the next morning, the battery was showing only 35% charged from fully charged the night before.  Since many people posting on the forums with battery problems were told to do a \"hard reboot\"  I tried that then fully charged the battery again (luckily, charging is pretty quick.)  Downloading music, and letting the display go to sleep mode, the HDX lost only about 10% per hour.  But as soon as I picked it up and played some games for a little while (like Temple Run 2) the battery much more rapidly depleted (this is with wifi turned on, as music was simultaneously downloading).  Then I recharged it, and again tested that same 2.5 hour previously downloaded movie -- with wifi turned off, \"airplane mode\" turned on, and brightness set at about 70%, the battery drained from fully charged to 65%. So, finally, I downloaded a 2 hour SD quality movie to my HDX, and going from fully charged, with wifi off, and brightness lowered to about 50%, the battery went to 88%, losing only 12%.  Yes, a big improvement over my original KFire which lost double that, 25%, under the same conditions.When I got my HDX it was about 70% charged.  Looking in the settings, I saw that the software was up-to-date.  I was able to download content, read, and play games, without the HDX turning itself off and rebooting (as many have complained of).  The next morning, I saw a notification that there had been a software update -- one thing that was changed is that you can now put apps and books into \"collections.\"  Not only that, but apparently my HDX \"synced\" wirelessly with my iPad Kindle reading app, where I had already put some books into collections.  Those same books now appear in collections on my HDX without my doing anything. Thank you Amazon.I give this 5 stars, certainly in comparison to the original Kindle Fire.

Over the next 4 years I purchased the Kindle Fire, the Kindle Fire HD, and now the Kindle Fire HDX (64Gb), all 7\" models.  Each Fire model has been a significant improvement over its predecessor, although of course none come remotely close to the battery life of the electronic ink models.  That being said, as a reader, battery life for all the Fire models is fine for those long airplane trips, where you have the bonus of the device playing music while you read.  Other reviewers have covered battery life for those willing to watch movies on such a small screen.  Being able to mirror movies from Amazon Prime onto my TV is good enough for my purposes.So what else is noticeably improved?  First off, the HDX is noticeably thinner, lighter, and faster.  Second, if your email requires VPN, there is an integrated VPN client that is almost trivial to set up (you may have to download the Thor OS upgrade for this, I did).  The provided email app connected easily for me. and I found new versions of apps I typically use, such as ES File Explorer and a really good (free) SSH terminal emulation app that works great on the HDX.I debated long and hard as to whether an upgrade from my HD was advisable at this time, and finally decided to take the plunge.  I'm glad I did.  The HDX is living up to the hype.  I even found the help feature useful.

He is 89 and very active, but he is not tech savvy. I paid extra to get a Kindle that was free of ads hoping that this would make the first screen cleaner and easier for him to see but the circulating messy backgrounds do not make it any easier for him to unlock the devise. The Kindle does have a touch to speech feature that is nice once the device is open, but when it is on, unlocking the device is significantly more difficult than it should be. Once you are reading an Kindle book, or listening to an audible book, there are some nice features, but getting to these features is not easy with low vision. The only way that my dad could use this would be if I opened the device, selected the book that he wanted, set up the text for him and then handed it to him.  I was really surprised and disappointed that this device was not more accessible. We require curb-cuts on sidewalks, and braille on elevators. We should also require that the folks who make these kind of devices include useful accessibility features in their tablets.Update: I have called Amazon and directly asked them to improve the accessibility of the Kindle. I would like to encourage everyone who would like to see better accessibility features for older adults to say so in their reviews and to take off at least one star. Amazon is more likely to help out if they hear this feedback from LOTS of people.

As much as I wanted to like it and use it, it's just not as convenient as the iPad. For one, getting music to it (except music purchased through Amazon) is a pain, requiring a file transfer app to copy from my iTunes library. From a usability standpoint, there are annoying compromises like: 1) I have to get my glasses and turn on a bright light to make sure I'm plugging the charger adapter in correctly, and then when I do, the connector is at an odd angle - not parallet to the unit, which makes it seem like it's less secure and more fragile; 2) the switch from portrait to landscape is sluggish; 3) having the power and volume controls on the underside are really inconvenient if you want to use it as a music play. The picture is great, but the Amazon-specific OS is a baffling decision by Amazon and indicates their priority is not user experience but on their ability to control the user's experience. The lack of apps and the quality of the apps is disappointing - still haven't been able to get the DirecTV remote app and the Chromecast app to work on the Kindle Fire HDX, whereas I have no problem with the apps on my iPad 2.

But the time came to declare allegiance.  Music and video purchases are less and less dependent on hard media like CDs and DVDs and are becoming more and more cloud based.  Which cloud\u2026that was the decision to make.So Amazon came out with fireTV\u2026and I took the plunge and decide to go with Amazon for my video purchases.  I have been a prime member since its inception\u2026and it is the first place I go to when I am looking to buy something.  I love Amazon\u2026probably in an unwholesome way.With that decision behind me I was now free to find a device to take entertainment with me when I travel for work.  Do you have any idea how long and painful it can be to copy DVDs into digital files to take along when traveling\u2026I simply did not have the patience to convert all 14 seasons Dallas!  I needed a device that would hold a number of videos to get me through at least 2 weeks overseas at a time.  Reliable streaming overseas is generally not an option for a variety of reasons.And so I bought a Kindle FireHDX (64MB, no ads) and have been absolutely delighted\u2026I seriously couldn\u2019t be happier.  It is so FAST\u2026compared to my android ASUS transformer tablet.  The video quality is beautiful.  The sound is great and it is extremely simple to download videos\u2026even Prime videos\u2026to take along on my travels.Of course, nothing is perfect.  There are some disappointments but they are relatively minor.1) Battery life is disappointing if wifi is not disabled.  That has been my experience.  I will lose 15 \u2013 20% overnight if I leave the wifi on.  With the wifi off\u2026battery life is very good.  If there is an option to turn off wifi after being asleep for a while\u2026I don\u2019t know about it yet.  Long term, hopefully something like this will be developed in a software update.2) Lack of a mini HDMI out.  I like to plug my device into the HDMI ports of hotel TVs and watch my shows from the bigger screen.  When I realized too late that it had no HDMI out, I bought a Tronsmart miracast device.  It will work but not as smoothly or easily as a simple cable would.  I think the miracast is not quite ready for prime time yet.  It is not the end of the world if I can\u2019t hook up the hotel TV.  Watching directly from the Kindle works well.3) Apps\u2026need more.  I once had a Blackberry Playbook.  What awesome tablet that was\u2026really.  Fine quality device, perfect in every way\u2026except for the limited number of apps.  Amazon has to make this a priority.  And the apps need to work beautifully\u2026like they do on my iPhone (see, I said I had one foot in both camps!)4) Flicker.  I notice a disturbing flicker with one of my apps.  Haven\u2019t let determined if this is strictly a single app issue or if it will show up elsewhere.  I\u2019ll update later if it is more than just this one app.All in all I feel this was a most self-indulgent purchase\u2026it is such a sweet device and the perfect travel companion.

Screen quality is stunning and video amazing. With the origami case there is some heft to the device and over time a unsupported hand holding it would tire. The origami case is a creative solution that works fairly well as a functional case btw. The help capability to instantly video chat with a tech is a positive experience. My Kindle arrived with special offers enabled, though I'd ordered without them. An email to customer support resulted in a reply within a couple hours, on Christmas Eve no less, with the sponsored ads removed, no charge. Incidentally, I think it would be useful if there was a way to opt back in for that content in order to receive the special offers in an unobtrusive manner. If this was controllable by the user that might be useful.I rate the poor marketing due to the following information in the product description: \"Stay productive on the go with ultra-fast web browsing, built-in OfficeSuite, and updated e-mail and calendar support for Gmail, Outlook, and more\"There is no built-in OfficeSuite. There is a built-in VIEWER.  A viewer is a very different product from an office suite. One can read documents but not be very productive if unable to produce documents, spreadsheets or presentations. This in my mind is just false and misleading advertising. A deciding factor in purchasing this product was the presence of a built-in office suite tool. You won't even know this either, unless you go looking on the product forum, as I and others have done, posting \"where is the built-in OfficeSuite? That should tell Amazon something - consumers are expecting a true suite of office tools. Either include one or more accurately portray what is on board.I chose this device after one too many crashes with my first gen iPad. So far, I'm happy with the technology.

Its lighter and the battery lasts longer than the new nexus 7 and I personally think the screen has better color reproduction and contrast.  I had both and compared side by side, the Kindle was just all around better.  HOWEVER, no access to google voice, hangouts, maps, Music, keep, gmail, docs, google calendar, and chrome makes this tablet limited in its awesomeness.  I use a laptop for most of my internet and \"productivity\" related tasks so no integration with the google ecosystem isn't a deal breaker for me.  But it sure would be nice to be able to have hangouts, keep, maps, and voice.  Almost 100% of my IMing happens in hangouts or facebook chat, neither of which are in the Amazon market, and I would love to check my texts with google voice on the tablet.  No gmail, chrome, docs, or calendar isn't a big deal because the substitutes they have are good enough, and no music is understandable because Amazon has their own music app BUT for light social applications and looking at Maps I really wish amazon would make a deal with Google or create  decent native apps that integrates with them.With that being said, I still like the HDX 7\" better than the nexus 7 tablet because of the seamless integration with the amazon ecosystem and amazing access to content through prime. Its so easy to watch movies, play games, read comics, and read books that what little leisure time I have is spent within the amazon ecosystem.  Movie/television integration is easier and more convenient than netflix on android and books look as good as they can on a tablet.

I have currently:1.) Kindle Fire (1st Gen.)2.) Kindle Fire HD 8.3 (2nd Gen.)3.) Kindle Fire HDX (3rd Gen Fire)4.) iPad Air  (5th Gen iPad)5.) iPad Mini with Retina Display (2nd Gen iPad Mini)6.) Google Nexus 7 (2013)7.) Nvidia Shield8.) ASUS Transformer TF-101First, let me say I think the Kindle Fire platform is really nice when compared to the straight-up Google android experience.  Amazon does a great job of bridging the technical gaps for a user wanting to use a tablet and not have to constantly enter their email and password.  The Amazon docs, photos, music and video compare better in use to Apple's iCloud experience and makes the Amazon prime a solid investment.  Additionally, the horsepower of the Kindle HDX is amazing and makes this tablet for the holiday 2013 season a solid gaming platform.  My own benchmarking of the Kindle Fire HDX shows that gaming performance and CPU performance place this unit within the same performance bracket as the current generation of iPads and the Nvidia sheild.  Which is saying something when the HDX is half the cost of an iPad mini and 2/3rds the cost of a Nvidia shield.My disappointment comes from the screen on the Kindle fire HDX.  The HDX's screen shows a very visible and noticeable blue ring around the display's edge.  I've measured the blue ring to be one-eighth of inch along the long edges of the screen and slightly less on the short edges of the screen.  These blue edges really become notable when you are reading a book or browsing a web page that have white page backgrounds.  The blue ringing is much less noticeable when viewing the carousel page (which are grey) or running a app that uses something darker around the edges.I can not recommend the Kindle Fire HDX to my friends, family and colleagues because of what I consider to be design defect in the screen.

Miracast is supposed to be like a wireless HDMI standard, but you have to buy a $50+ device to make it work.  The other thing missing from this is USB hosting, which is present in every Android 3.1+ device.  I wanted to use my Kindle Fire HDX to upload photos from my camera to Facebook and the like while I was out on vacation by using a Micro USB SD Card Reader.The no HDMI thing doesn't bug me as much as the USB thing, I really wanted to be able to look at my vacation photos on my Kindle Fire HDX while I was out on vacation.

I love knowing that I can hand my tablet over to my 3 year old and he'll only be able to see and play what I approve for him. I also like that I don't have to tell him when time's up. He just hands me back the tablet and goes to play.Reading on this Kindle is so nice. I love that it holds my spot and tells me how far along I am in the book. I also like that I have access to all the books I've bought in one place. It's a lot easier to carry this around than it is to carry around a heavy book.Cons:I'm not so fond of where the power button is. It's kind of awkward to find. As well as the charging port. It's at an odd angle and I have to actually pay attention to what I'm doing when I plug it in.The apps from the Kindle store are few and far between. There aren't a whole lot of them. There are the basic ones for social networking and a few good (free) games. But I'm hoping that in the near future Amazon will come out with a lot more apps.I also wish I could add more storage space to this like the android tablets.

There aren't as many apps for the Fire as you have for iPad, but I'm guessing that's just a matter of time before they fix that.I mainly bought the Fire so that I could add my very extensive book collection to it. For reading I've been using the Kindle Touch 3GB, and I have more books than I have space. I found it tedious having to add and delete books all the time. I thought the Fire would be a good step up.If you have a couple hundred books, the Fire is perfect for your book collection. But if you're like me, and have been using Kindle for years and have a 6K+ collection, you might be disappointed.First, you have to click on every single book to import it onto the Fire. There is no batching. I really wish they could have had an \"add whole collection\" option. Importing is tedious at best.Second, you can't just import your old collections and believe that all books will automatically place themselves in the correct collection. First of all, I now have collections from my very first Kindle on the Fire. A Kindle that has been deregistered from my account for ever.The collections that did import correctly, are a mess. Books are missing, or the wrong books are in the wrong collection.Then there is the books that aren't in a collection. If you're viewing your books as collections, you can't find the books that aren't in a collection. It is simply impossible to figure out which book is in a collection and which book needs to go in a collection. I like to organize my books, and collections were the perfect way to do so. On the Touch, that is. On the Fire, it's all a big pile'o'crap, and I can't figure out what's up and what's down.So far, bookwise, Fire has been a huge letdown for me. I was really excited about getting the new HDX with the 64GB hard drive, thinking I'd finally be able to put by books in order. Not so much.As far as reading experience, the Fire is very good. The screen is clear, the text easy to read, and it doesn't hurt your eyes like the iPad does. Which is the only reason I give the Fire HDX 3/5 stars. I really hope Amazon updates the OS real soon where you have the option to import your whole collection with just a few clicks. And most of all I hope they fix the collections issues. Just thinking about what a mess my Kindle is makes me want to cry.", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire Is Growing Up!", "Author": "JPP Smorenburg", "ReviewID": "R5TINYTF5X0WF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I want to share my feelings about my new HDX 7 which I received recently. I'll update the review as I get to know the HDX as time passes. I use the HDX daily for 2 hours on average reading and surfing. I use a PaperWhite 3G at work and at home and have used previous E-ink Kindle generations for daily reading in the past. Kindle Fire is growing up fast. The vastly upgraded device response and fluidity are already well commented on. The extra speed when surfing the web and navigating the HDX are again a big step up, good work. There is very little display reflection, improving reading once again this gen. Text is totally, faultlessly sharp.A very cool software feature in the Kindle app are the extra Wikipedia and Translation boxes that come together with the dictionary definition box, totally cool. Silk works better, taking many opened tabs in its stride and making the most of the display size with the cool article mode and nicely working full screen option that takes away the tabs and adress bar to move the page upward. I always found the iPad 4:3 display ratio appealing, but the Silk features mentioned above make the 16:9 ratio enjoyable for web surfing while keeping the device as small as possible.The form factor is again much improved with the HDX generation, no apologies necessary anymore. It's much more manageable than my previous generation HD 7; noticably less circumference and a third less weight. The physical buttons are very tactical, unlike those on the previous gen., and the sometimes mentioned \"angled\" USB port feels and looks solid, not at all awkward. The bezels are smaller and the plastic outer enveloping rim much more so giving a very tight, high quality appearance compared to the previous gen.In my opinion, Amazon have at this generation arrived at a wonderful compromise between \"boutique\" (like iPad) and \"utility\" (previous gen. HD) moving steadily toward the iPad. Also with the HDX, there is a better compromise between Amazon presence (say, like an Amazon website-type environment) and an open Android presence (like any generic android tablet) with the HDX showing beautiful, eerily sharp lockscreen wallpapers, app icons matrix and book covers, with removable recommendations which, removed, leave an \"Android or iPad like\" home screen save for the background, which is (in my opinion) nicely dark with classy icon shadowing.Battery life is at least as enduring as on my previous gen. HD. Sound is as good to my ears.UPDATE:I have some clouding, showing a brighter spot of about an inch in the centre of the display, which is visible on an even background like when reading. I can only get rid of it when switching to white text on black. The slight blue border bleeding is also present, but doesn't bother me at all.UPDATE 12/3/2013: I've requested and was right away permitted after a short live chat an exchange HDX to arrive in a couple of days, amazing stuff!UPDATE 12/5/2013: I received my replacement HDX today. What a miracle of logistics; from across the Atlantic traceable almost to the hour. Even my return HDX I can track. Boggles the mind. Well, I must say the clouding is less with the new one, but I can still see it. My daughter (painter artist) shakes her head and says: \"You exchanged it for that?\", when I show her the \"faulty\" one. Must be me then. I'll accept it as a HDX character trait.UPDATE 12/14/2013:The HDX performs excellently, the smaller size and mass, and the very sharp, defined characters are more appreciated as time in use passes. The new ability to sort cloud content in collections is much appreciated. Silk occasionally froze. Disabling page load acceleration solves that.This device is a big improvement over the previous HD; better ergonomics again, better display, less glass glare, much more zip, diminishing the E-reading gap with the glorious PaperWhite. My PW is certainly used less for reading since the HDX is here. As we live in the real world, I think the price:quality ratio is very important, and the HDX has made that ratio more favourable again for my ends, which are: reading E-books, internet news and watching news videos with the best possible display quality and low weight and size at a good price. Weighing the above factors, the HDX-Amazon combo is unbeatable. What I would call a Serious Tablet.Job very well done,Recommended!UPDATE 1/5/2014:For an Epub reader app, I can recommend Aldiko, downloaded through their website via a sent link for the free, non-ad reader. Really hassle-free, with only the basic options for good reading, not playing. The only caveat is crashing of the app with large .Pdf's. But it's not really needed for those; the embedded Kindle Reader app is superior for handling .Pdf. No need to waste space installing the Adobe Reader.For a good enough productivity app, I can recommend the King Soft Free version through the Amazon App Store. No ads, no hassle, easy connection to Google Drive.Good File Manager app: Free no-ad ES File Manager through the Amazon app store. (You can get easy access to your Cloud Account by adding in ES through documents/network/add (+ key at bottom, pick your account)Good Task Manager: Free no-ad ES Task Manager through the Amazon app store.", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "HDX is even better!", "Author": "Kindle Customer \"Chuvasia\"", "ReviewID": "R1FRVSKFODHZFW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Being able to download Prime instant videos is sweet!

It is so much more fun and useful than a plain ole reader which is what I was using - I can check E Mail, play a game, or read a book.  I have not yet mastered all of the other possibilities.  It does not require an extra internet service of its own - but does need access to Wi-Fi in order to use the E Mail and other interactive internet functions.  I still have a lot  to learn and master - but in the interim I am enjoying it immensely.  On the negative side - if you are playing games the battery life is not long - it requires charging often.  My other problem is in trying to leave the page you are reading in a book and go somewhere else and then come back to that page - I have lost where I actually was in the book when I did go back to reading same.", "Date": "November 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "LOVE LOVE LOVE", "Author": "Nebraska Gal", "ReviewID": "R2M8YLOJMGUK1P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am absolutely in love with my Kindle.

The two best features are the Mayday button and the song lyrics. No tablet that I'm aware of has any support even close to the Mayday button. You simply tap the onscreen button and, voila, a person comes on your screen and helps you. A real person you can see. The can't see you, but they can see your screen. I've used it a couple of times and never waited more than 10-15 seconds before they were right there speaking to me. AMAZING!Second, the new rolling lyrics with your music is awesome, however,  not many songs have the lyrics yet. I'm sure they're working on the data base, but the more current songs are available. On some albums some songs are done but not all. Great idea and hopefully Amazon is bringing lyrics in quickly.And let's not forget xray for movies. Tap the screen and you'll get a pop-up with movie info like the names of which actors are on the screen at any given moment. Awesome!Awesome machine... If it just had front AND rear facing cameras it would be perfect. It does have front facing, but not rear. Try it you'll love it! I hope the Mayday button catches on across the industry because support is usually so difficult!

Its performance really great and I have never been disappointed so far, the only problem I noticed that this device missing a navigation apps and Google maps doesn't work as expected on it!

I wanted to see the performance and size of this, including thin-ness. The color and clarity are simply stunningly fantastic -- better than any other tablet that I've seen.

I had bought a reconditioned 8.9\" Kindle HD, with 32 gb the day before with Amazon Card, but haven't opened it, knowing that this would be here a day later.My kids have filled their Kindles with game crap, but I wanted the extra space to have more books downloaded at the same time, and more space for movies, music and 'future expansion space.'One might laugh, but as a comics fan I read the volume collections. A little small for my old eyes, so I'm sort of forced to use panel view. But, for USA Today, the smallest text size was just perfect. That is an auto format site, and works great.Finally, my OWN Kindle. I had been sharing one used by my son, but now, no more swapping. No drained battery for dear old dad.I don't see a speed difference yet (I'm not a gamer), but this thing is THIN. I'm hoping to get longer battery life with a smaller screen.The only thing so far is that I am adjusting to a smaller Kindle, having been using the 8.9 HD.", "Date": "November 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "That Upgrade", "Author": "Z.
