{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good little tablet", "Author": "Alisha K", "ReviewID": "R25UI9QQDHXHXT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this for about a week now and have done my best to push it to its limits.  The apps I've tried on it have mostly worked well.  I'd recommend getting an app that monitors and allows you to close apps that you aren't using to help it run smoother.The biggest con is that it doesn't come with google play so you have to use the amazon app store.  Google play is by far better than amazon but its not a big downfall.It does have a slot for a microsd card and I have a 32g class 4 card that works well in it; however, it won't come out.  I don't know if its just a defect on mine or what  but don't put a card in that you want to be able to take out.Wifi works great and browses the web easilyInternal speakers are okay.Touch screen is good.Picture is niceDoesn't come with a manual and currently there isn't one online.Has a decent webcam but no rear facing camera so don't expect to use it as a camera.Basically you're getting what you pay for.  Its a good little tablet but if you want something that is heavy duty and will take anything and everything you throw at it, I'd recommend investing more money into something else.", "Date": "May 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "I LOVE IT !!!", "Author": "Grandpa", "ReviewID": "R1H8KIMLVISD4W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was tired of lugging my laptop on trips, and watching TV with my laptop in my lap.  I tried using my cell phone -- a Samsung Galaxy S (T-Mobile variant) running Android 2.2.  I use my cell phone for EVERYTHING - it's my electronic Swiss army knife.  I have 152 apps loaded on it and use most of them routinely.  It has been very useful on trips when I don't bring my laptop; however, the screen's too small for casual web browsing and reading my daily dose of comics, and since it doesn't have a camera in the front, it doesn't do Skype with video.I tried a Nokia 770 tablet about two years ago to determine what I really wanted out of a tablet.  I decided 7\" was ideal for me, and it needed to be fast enough not to be frustrating.  I am now on my second Android phone and really like Android.  I also was not willing to pay the $500 for an iPad, nor a similar price for an Android tablet.  I have been lurking for a tablet since then.  I can be very patient, and in this case, it worked very well indeed.Enter the Alluratek Cinepad.  It came out a week or so ago, but it met or exceeded all my specs, which had by now been elevated to include Android 4.0.  I ordered it as soon as I could and it arrived yesterday.  I LOVE IT.  It is more than fast enough, and the touchscreen input is perfect.  I've already loaded and tested a bunch of apps, including Angry Birds (yes, an old fart can love that game ...).  Skype works perfectly, both my e-mail accounts are loaded and working perfectly, and my favorite set of Opera browsers are loaded and tested.  I loaded Aldiko, my favorite Android eBook reader, in case I don't have my Kobo Touch along.  I also have Aldiko loaded on my cell phone and have used that, which is OK, but the tablet is quite a bit more enjoyable -- I already tried it.Everything works even better than I had anticipated.  After all, what can you expect for $119.  Well, I can say now that I got a lot more than I expected -- a whole lot more.It \"only\" has 4 gig of storage, but it has the ability to take an external microSD card.  My phone has a 32 gig card and my tablet will have one soon.Other considerations:1)The screen resolution isn't up to the standards of the iPad, but it's a very nice display and perfect for what I use it for.2) The frame around the screen is a bit wider than it needs to be ... however, that is one compromise I'm quite willing to accept when realizing I'm saving almost $400.  There are precious few compromises based on my needs.  Caveat:  Your needs may vary.In answer to a question I know will come up ... I take extended trips abroad and need the long battery life of an e-ink reader like the Kobo.  I can never be certain I'll be able to charge my electronics and I'm an avid reader.  I also read while sitting outside, and regular tablets are not nearly as easy to view as an e-ink screen.  I'd like to have a unit that would do everything, but they do not exist yet.  That's part of the specifications for my next tablet!All in all, I'm extremely happy with my purchase.  All I have to do now find a case for it ...June 18:  I've now had my Aluratek for seven weeks, and I still love it.  At one point it got really slow, but I tracked it down to an offending app, removed the app and the tablet was back to its frisky self.Oh, and I purchased a case for it ... with a keyboard.  I plugged the keyboard in and it works! Perfectly!  With no changes required to the Aluratek!  I had contacted Aluratek and they said a keyboard was supported, so I purchased one and now I'm really happy with my purchase.", "Date": "May 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "pros and cons", "Author": "P3bcak!", "ReviewID": "R12KOR8PLUCKS6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros:Price; good value for the $Battery life as expectedRenders video (netflix, skype) just fineUSB, microSD card for cross-loadingHDMI port - stream that video to your 50\" if you want to.Amazon App StoreHaptics are on par with this price point.

I wanted smaller 7\" tablets for my kids that were \"affordable\" so they would stop stealing mine! This is one of the newest 7\" tablets with Android 4.x installed. I ordered two. One showed up with a row of dead pixels and a MicroSD card slot that wouldn't eject (I saw this in another review, I got mine back with a small pair of tweezers!). The vendor I purchased from replaced the 2nd one right away. Other than having to side load a dozen applications I am very satisfied. Having the Amazon App store is a good work around; and I loaded it on my Google approved devices, apps can be free in one app store and not in another. I would recommend this tablet. Get a case (kindle case with a light works nice and overcomes the hard to read navigation buttons)", "Date": "July 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fancy cover, wrong guts", "Author": "Tomas Hejda", "ReviewID": "R2QPBRQUASL9Y", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I suppose that I fll into the same category as the few around here that have reported that their tablet arrived labeled AT107F but the internal check revealed model T06A. Unlike the 107F, this tablet runs Android 4.0.4, there is no Google Play, and on top of it, GetJar just plain doesn't work. When attempting to download an pupil cation, the message screen says either 'download filed' or 'download unavailable'.In addition, a full charge provides about 45 minutes of operation, which is unacceptable. After a power ail, the date and time s forgotten.It's a $100 device, and my expectations were high. However, it seems to work well for many, who received AT107F with Android 4.0.3. Mine is useless without being able o download apps and other such short battery life.
