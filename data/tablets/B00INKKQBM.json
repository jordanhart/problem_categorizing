How to spot a fake review.", "Author": "Truvru", "ReviewID": "R20XBAK0KXB4WP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was looking for a low cost tablet that would fit the bill for my kids, and came across this listing with all 5 star reviews (now after posting mine, it will not longer be that). Before deciding on the purchase, I was curious about these \"Verified Purchases\" as they seemed too good to be true, \"awesome product\", \"Good buy\", \"5 star\", \"GREAT TABLET\", etc. so I went through each of the reviewers profile by clicking on the \"See all my reviews\". And guess what?! Each of the reviewer had 5 or 6 other reviews on tablets ALL made by FastTouch, which made me suspect these so-called \"Verified Purchases\" were made by their own company trying to boost up their own ratings giving the false sense of a 5-star product. Even though I have not purchased this product, such type of tactics are one of the worst things that can be done and will ruin a companies reputation. I can no longer trust any reviews from FastTouch products as being genuine or honest. If Amazon can allow such reviews, I have to carefully \"review\" other reviewers to see if they look honest and legitimate. Please check out the wiki how on how you can also spot other fake reviews on Amazon.", "Date": "June 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good product!", "Author": "Katie", "ReviewID": "R125METTAE0RAX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The product arrived way before it was supposed to which is a HUGE PLUS!
