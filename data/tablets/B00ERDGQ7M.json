Very easy to use, have a 7\" tablet w/2.0 so operating a tablet isn't new to me.Opened the box found a extra screen film and a pouch that fits the Kocaso 10\" tablet!!! <<< Did NOT expect these!!!!Rear camera works well, clear pictures and video, wish the tablet had a tripod mount. That would make taking steadier video's.", "Date": "October 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Lots For Your $!", "Author": "mft", "ReviewID": "R1CZ5NTFOYFLG9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this tablet back in November as an early Christmas treat to myself. This is the third tablet I've purchased. I wanted both a bit bigger higher definition screen but also a faster machine as there's a few live games I've grown fond of and the smaller/slower tablets would run them but at times would hang.The first thing I noticed was how well packaged this tablet was. As everyone knows due to handling during shipping almost anything can become damaged in the process but Kocaso did a very fine job with their packaging to help ensure that possibility is at a minimum. Other than a few small bubbles under the pre-installed screen protector (easily fixed) everything was pristine perfection and the tablet even had a charge. To make sure I'd get the most out of the battery the first few times I used it I used it all out then fully recharged. Battery has been great. I can read my kindle books for as long as six hours without problem. Games and high graphic apps of course cut the time down a lot but over all am thrilled with it's battery life.Everything with this tablet has been easy....and being as how I have used it a good 8+ hours a day for over the past 4 months I do think I have put it through a fair trial period. Compared to most common tablets with less than 1g speed processors, and only 512mb ddram, this thing seems to fly.....the speed and smoothness of operation from app to app is amazing coming from such a modestly priced unit/impressive. The only time I have noticed it to want to lag is when I've had a ton of apps/windows open at once.....and if I'd get a memory card for additional space I'm thinking even that would improve.Here's perhaps the best thing about Kocaso:  I had an 'oopsy' moment and fell asleep dropping my beloved tablet and the screen cracked on the corner of the coffee table....HELP! No worries....even though I had not the foresight to have been wise enough to purchase the protection plan (trust me they are good to have!) I was able to call Kocaso direct at their NY office, email them my proof of purchase here from amazon, and for a pittance they are sending me a brand spankin new replacement....YES REALLY!This device, and especially those good folks standing behind it, are top notch. You won't find a tablet of this size offering more quality at a better price. :)", "Date": "February 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "So far so good", "Author": "Lori E Lindau", "ReviewID": "R1QMHSV7BD9QR7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My grandson is delighted with the large, bright display.

Unfortunately for me I ended up buried and work and never got around to it so I had to eat the money wasted on this. The screen is so bad that you can only view it in one angle (landscape mode). If you move it to portrait mode half the screen becomes blacked becomes blacked out.
