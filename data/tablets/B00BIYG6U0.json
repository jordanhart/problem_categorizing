I Had no interest in tablets, notebooks, or anything like that. Then I received a check in the mail from a class action law suite I didn't even know I was a part of. As I explored possibilities of what to do with the wind fall, I came across these Tablets. Lots of research convinced me this was a great toy/tool. And it turned out to be a great buy. The Android operating system is better than I ever expected. This tiny computer plays games my PC doesn't, accesses my e-mails, surfs the web, and is so light and small it almost fits in my pocket. Three hours of battery time is OK, though like most people I wish for more. I am very happy with this purchase, Over the years Amazon has been my first choice for online purchases. They know what customer service means. I trust them to always do the right thing if there ever is a problem.", "Date": "April 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bad product, Poor camera,", "Author": "jmarshall1007", "ReviewID": "R215HIYSGXNUR7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought the pad 3 weeks ago.

It's had a LOT of use over those 2 years and has been clumsily dropped by myself several times. Very sturdy and scratch resistant apparently-still looks new. I hardly ever switch on my desktop since I got it. It's so much easier to just grab my D2. I'll have found what I'm looking for a lot quicker with the tablet rather than waiting for the PC to boot up. D2 has a standby system so you can leave it running and it hardly uses any battery as long as you have no programs running. With the Full Gig of RAM and the fastest processor I've seen in this class, you'll be amazed at how quick it runs. I like to watch Netflix and Youtube on it when my son has the TV tied up with Xbox.

She likes it when I play the mommy bird.  Since she is still small, I read the children book over and over again for her while she's sitting on the high chair. D2 got not dual camera, it's not a big deal for me, I always use my cell phone to take picture, so I don't really care if it's single camera or dual camera at all.

But after one day of try outs I found the product to be very lacking in many respects. Firstly, the battery is a horror story and I am not exaggerating because I am pissed; the battery is really really poor. It lasts approximately 40 mins of intense use, wats up with that. Secondly, the audio is barely above a whisper. I have to now go and buy speakers if I want my niece to hear music and watch videos; an extra cost i can do without. Thirdly the camera, at night the camera cannot take any pictures unless you are capturing the dark you cannot see a single image even when your house light is on. I am laughing right now jus typing about the camera ( even a me too phone has a better camera). And finally the wireless, the best connectivity is when you are close to the router any distance and the connection is poor.The picture quality is not bad and u can download the important apps u want. Dats about for the good. To be brutally honest I will not recommend this product for any parent buying this for their kids, cousins, nieces and nephews or anybody for dat matter.last but not least, it took them sometime to shipped this product.Update 03/06/13The charger of this product no longer works.

Pros; At first I loved it, it IS super easy to set up & that's saying alot considering I'm not tech savvy. I could easily figure it all out without referring to the user manual. The touch screen worked fab and was not glitchy, the gyro screen automatic orientation adjust thing works better than my samsung charge smartphone's does!,it has speech activated option and text to talk etc which is great for visually impaired as I am. You can also make the font size huge and it works on everything. it's just great if you don't plan on using it to download apps or retrieve emails, surf or do anything that requires it to connect to wifi.It just would NOT hold onto my wifi signal. I have an internet TV 4ft farther away from where I was using the D2 that never has wifi probs. The D2 98% of the time said my wifi was \"out of range\" and the few times it did pick up the signal it dropped it less than five minutes later. I called tech support. 20 minutes later someone finally answered. She actually told me \"you get what you pay for\"! She said that for the money they cost it does not have a long wifi reception range & that it would help if I was \"right next to the wireless router\" or I could TRY changing the security setting (to be less secure :/)on the router she further suggested, but added that most people don't want to do that. I was too upset to think to ask her what would that have to do with signal strength. Needless to say I'm returning this piece of junk.
