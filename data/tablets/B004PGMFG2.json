{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A review for those new to tablets AND Android", "Author": "Kilgore Gagarin \"Those who believe in telekin...", "ReviewID": "R1OT2WGKIPSW7K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "UPDATE 26 NOV 2012: Please note that the following review was for the Le Pan I and NOT the Le Pan II. Due to circumstances not under my control this review may actually appear under the latest Le Pan II which appears to be a good upgrade but I've never used it - I am still happily using the first version tablet (Le Pan I) acquired in June, 2011 (so durability is good).IMPORTANT UPDATE 11/30/2011: Please read B. Brinton's Amazon review (can't give the URL but it's one of the two star reviews here) regarding inability to update to new operating system. I stand by my original review as to the quality of the tablet, but recommend that you check out Brinton's review before actually buying.Before I even start, I absolutely LOVE my Le Pan tablet. It's a blast to use, has a lot of upside for the things I want to do with it, and has a definite \"wow\" factor with bystanders. Typical quotes are, \"wow,\" and \"I want one\" and \"that is so cool!\" This could be said about a lot of the better tablets (e.g., iPad) that have nice, high def, shiny screens showing video, but I appreciated the coveting looks (and I let people play with it extensively and had trouble getting it back a couple times).I have never used a tablet (well, 10 minutes goofing with an iPad in the Apple Store a year ago) and have never used anything with the Android operating system.A lot of my \"cons\" are probably pertinent to a lot of similar pieces of hardware, as well as shortcomings of the Android OS as it is currently implemented, rather than unique to the Le Pan.I would NOT recommend this for someone looking for a turnkey, works perfectly out of the box solution. You will need either some experience, or a strong nerd compulsion (or a little of both). You'll have to overcome quirks of the hardware and software.First, the \"bad.\"The power button sucks. After four days I STILL fumble with that sucker.The fingerprints on the screen drive me nuts. I think it's worse in a tablet with a large screen than on an Android or Iphone with smaller screens. I'm already carrying around a microfiber cleaning cloth. A definite hazard of this entire class of machine. You might want to invest in some wet-dry LCD screen wipes for when you want to get it in pristine condition before you show off in front of the boss (e.g., Audiovox Surface SURF402 Wet/Dry Screen Wipes). Think of it as detailing your tablet.Saying the speakers are \"tinny\" might be generous and there is absolutely no recognizable bass component. I'm ready to get a bluetooth headphone for this immediately.Can't run Hulu to watch TV (yet) - the hardware is probably perfectly capable, but Hulu sees \"Android mobile device\" and just serves up an annoying message. However YouTube (included app) looks and works better than I have ever seen it.It's heavier than I thought, but not that bad. It's about the same weight as an iPad. I found that holding it in one hand I would cramp up after a couple of minutes. It is light enough to cradle, and propping it up on an ample paunch while in bed was ok. Sitting down with tablet on lap, no problem.Next, the \"weird.\"The onboard camera only shoots pictures in a mirror mode (i.e., titles of books are reversed like in a mirror). In using Skype I found that for this version of Android, video calling is not supported. Otherwise, Skype works quite nicely on this platform.In certain network environments (I'm on a University network half the time) you can easily purchase apps via the included Android Market, but downloading wouldn't commence - probably some security feature of our network. Using my home wifi connection (DSL via AT&T;) I had no problems downloading and installing Skype and some other navigation based stuff.The included browser can't handle Ebsco databases (if that means anything to you). The browser handles most websites well, and the large screen means you don't need to access the specially configured mobile sites, which are still a lot cleaner. I ran this on our library catalog and most of our databases with no problem, but the Ebsco ones didn't allow any search entry. Weird. (NOTE ADDED June 2, 2011: Just installed the Opera Mobile Web Browser ver. 11 from the Apps for Android store on Amazon and the Ebsco databases work just fine).Finally, the \"good.\"The screen is awesome (except in daylight where it is useless). Use this indoors, not at the beach.The response time is lightning fast. Apps come up fast and operate fast. Scrolling, screen switching, etc. is ultra-smooth.In the right network environment, getting, installing, and using apps is trivial.The integration with web based Google apps is seamless. I didn't even notice my calendar and contacts were downloaded and synchronized (and continue to be synchronized). A very cool thing I discovered this morning was that when I was out of wifi range (on my bus and train commute) I could still do my Gmail offline. The Gmail app downloads and caches your email so you can use it offline, including replying to messages. The next time you get a wifi connection, synchronization will send all pending messages, and download new ones - this was all done while sitting in my backback.The GPS is useful, but not yet a substitute for a good stand-alone unit (I'm a TomTom user). But the connection to Google Maps is very cool. You have to wrestle to find it, but once you get into street view, it's obvious that high def simulated 3d is designed for tablets with big shiny screens. I'm still struggling with the interface (I think the GPS keeps wanting to tether me to Missouri), but I've taken friends to Florence and Rome on this tablet, and the fast and seamless \"look around\" on a tablet is very, very, nice.Photos and video on this screen are gorgeous, without question. I haven't read anything yet that contests that - I vouch for the visual impressiveness as well. Again, the screen WILL get covered in finger smudges, and if you're in any kind of daylight you're out of luck seeing anything.So, take this review in stride. Think of my comments as caveats and warnings, and whether or not they're deal breakers is up to you and what you need. I'm not sure there is any tablet that can satisfy all the myriad details wanted by end users. I give this four stars for being an impressive work with some upside potential with upgrades (video calling with Skype, Hulu compatibility). Read the specs and decide if things like not having video output is important, or not.ADDED June 2, 2011: To watch movies you might have to convert them to an appropriate format (and/or download some other video software). I've been able to take video and using VLC (free and available on PCs and Macs) and convert to MP4 format then view with no problem. Also, because of movie sizes, you're likely going to need to buy a bigger micro SD chip (or two). I have some DVDs from Orlando (wife and kids swimming with the dolphins) and was able to extract the unprotected \"VOB\" files. I converted to a couple of formats but the MP4 format seemed to universally work. Again, this is one of those areas you need a bit of a nerd compulsion to work out.Regarding using wet/dry pads to clean the screen. Almost all of the standard pads should work fine, but in most cases you're going to waste a lot of pad. I've taken to opening the pouches and cutting the wet AND dry pads in half. Then I stuff them back in the pouches and fold it over to preserve the dampness. You can probably clean the screen 3 to 4 times with one set of pads (experiment on your own).UPDATE AFTER SIX WEEKS (added July 15, 2011): I'm hooked. Durable, dependable, and now I've modded it with all sorts of useful and fun apps (hint: Amazon apps store gives a free app a day SUCH A DEAL!!!). I've been using for six weeks without a hitch and this has become my \"go to\" device for browsing the net and wasting time (playing games). Power button still sucks, but I've gotten used to the fingerprints.UPDATE AFTER SEVEN MONTHS (added January 11, 2012): Le Pan has now come out with a successor, the Le Pan II, so this will be my final update. I received my Le Pan in early June, 2011. As of this date my TC970 is still running strong with no quirks or hardware faults whatsoever. Anecdote is not evidence, but my personal experience continues to be positive with this tablet. I even loaned it to my son for a couple of weeks as he took it to Budapest, Prague, and Vienna. Toting it around Europe in a backpack for two  weeks, and it's back home, still humming along perfectly. This is still one fine machine.", "Date": "May 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent Tablet that exceeds expectations", "Author": "Ernest S Sanchez", "ReviewID": "R1O5BV6UYDSWJG", "Overall": "5.0",

Mine still works perfectly.  I have had it physically powered off for only about 2 weeks during this 2 year period, I literally just set it to sleep mode when not in direct use by myself.  Even with that constant use my battery life is still nearly what it was when I bought it.  When the tablet gets to about 35% battery I charge it up (usually to full if time allows).  I have a bit of an issue with bringing it out of sleep.  I press the power button and sometimes get no response.  I simply hold the power button and it wakes up asking if I want to power down.  I select \"no\" and log in just fine.  I do not use my tablet non-stop like I did initially, but it is always working and still does everything it did before.  My parent's Le Pan I's are still working fine for them.  I also convinced my roommate and another friend to get Le Pan II's earlier this year.  My roommate loves his and has found it invaluable for using recipes, watching youtube videos, and a few other purposes.  He has had his with constant use for about 3 months now and no problems.  My other friend got hers earlier this week.  I shall update when I can about her response to it, but thus far it is working just like mine and she loves it.Update 4 August 2012:  ICS has been released and it is working very well.  Flash support on chrome is giving me some trouble, but Dolphin browser still has it working fine.  ICS is nice and runs a bit smoother.  I cannot get the HDMI mirroring to work (and now have the official Le Pan cable for it) so if that is important wait on the upgrade.  I am really enjoying ICS far more than I thought I would.  I remade the attached video in a streamlined format with ICS and it is on youtube, just search \"le pan ice cream sandwich\" and I think it comes up.  Since I think they still ship with Honeycomb I am leaving the old video up for now.Update 23 May 2012:  I am still very pleased with my tablet.  I have had almost no problems, and the few I have had were fixed with a reset.  I leave my tablet on all the time.  All the time.  The total time it has spent physically off since I got in Jan is less than 3 days.  I still have good battery life and things are great.  Quick note since this generation of tablets is being replaced by newer models(transformer prime, Ipad 3, etc).  You can now find comparable tablets with good options in the ballpark of this price.  Part of my emphatic nature of recommending this tablet originally was that all comparable tablets at the time were $400 or more.  Le Pan II is still certainly a contender.  One advantage this tablet still has is being nearly the only Android tablet of 4:3 ratio.  I find that very comfortable for web browsing.  If that is not a big deal you could probably get a Xoom or some such that is comparable and possibly better depending on the price, though most are refurbs versus Le Pan being for a new unit.  I still recommend this tablet, but the progression of technology marches on.  Also if you have a Roku and get an android device check out Gregg Reno's apps for Roku; Juice for Roku is the app I use second most.  It is only beaten out by the browser on my tablet.  I have a surround sound system and now my tablet is graphical radio control; it is awesome for anyone with a lot of mp3s.Video:In my video I show basic functions, google applications, amazon applications, built in camera, music and video demos.  Much of the bullet list of pros and cons are still best seen in the review below.  It ran kind of long, so I cut it back for amazon's requirements.  Sorry again for the length of it and my written review, but there is so much to say about this tablet.  I very much hope it helps people make informed decisions.**Also the tablet accesses Google Play (my video was before the switch when it was Android Market, but it still allows access to all the Google apps and markets).Original review:Let me start by saying that I purchased the TC970 (previous model) back in October, and after 2 months was excited about the Le Pan II.  I have had the Le Pan II for a few hours and am really enjoying it already.  Originally I was wary about the unknown company, but took a chance.  It was the best move I have ever made since I got a reliable Ipad quality device at a fraction of the price.  I shall comment more on that in the company section.Basics:**Pros:It has a nice professional build and feels solid, no cheap plastic feel here.  All quality.Fast processor, boots in about 30 seconds, quick start on apps, and can run many with no problems.It has a 4:3 aspect ratio like the Ipad, which I find more comfortable for web browsing than the 16:9 tablets.Fully functioning android market.Youtube app works great.Syncs with Gmail just fine.Beautiful high definition screen.Full Flash support.Sensitive screen with good response on keyboard, I can type about 30 words per minute on the tablet (~90 on a real keyboard) and it keeps up just fine (my speed is going up as I get used to the onscreen keyboard).No problems with Wifi, good signal.Good accelerometer, can use it to play games easily and works well with google sky map.Decent microphone with wide pick up (I use a frequency analyzing program).**Cons:Proprietary 30 pin connector, but it comes with a USB connection and charger (so only kind of annoying).No USB ports, do not get keyboards that connect through USB (it does support Bluetooth so you can get accessories, but only with Bluetooth).No rear camera (no big deal to me, I have a digital camera anyway), and front facing camera is only 2MP.**Notes:The speakers are above average for portable devices (almost no portable devices have good speakers since good bass usually needs larger speakers).  These are pretty good overall, but for audio excellence in any portable device you need a good pair of headphones.I have not tried to connect this tablet to my TV with HDMI, I still need to get the adapter, but will update after I try.  It does not come with the connector initially (at this time anyway).I expect it will function similar to the TC970, so the battery life should hold for about 7 hours even with constant video use.  I almost never turned my old one off, just sleep mode.  It can run for days easily in sleep mode.  With intermittent use I would only charge every 3 days or so and expect the Le Pan II to perform about the same.Cases:  I use an off-brand case designed for the HP touchpad (HHI HP TouchPad Folio Flip Case with Muti-Function Stand - Purple (Package include a HandHelditems Sketch Stylus Pen)), and it works well.  I had to cut it a little to use the camera and access volume, and I have to remove it from the case to charge it.  However, I got the Targus Truss Case/Stand for HP TouchPad - THZ07202US (Black/Gray) for my mother and this will fit the Le Pan II (identical size to the TC970) perfectly and allow easy access to all ports.  In general you can use any case designed for Ipad or Touchpad, but may need to cut a little free for all the ports to be open.Interface:**Pros:Latest OS (honeycomb with possible upgrade to ICS)Runs all online video well.  My main problem with the last version was that I could not watch amazon prime videos on it.  Partly it was the hardware, and partly android 2.2.  This tablet runs amazon streaming just fine, as well as Blip.tv, and comedy central's videos (just the few I have tested).  I do not have Netflix, but the reviews of the last tablet (TC970) said that it worked fine with the Netflix app and I expect this one will too.**Cons:None really.  I got used to the simplicity of Froyo, so Honeycomb is proving challenging to adapt to, but I still figured everything I wanted to do out within an hour or so of playing with it.Tying into the last point, the previous version the TC970 may be a little easier for the non-technical people to use.  My parents can use Android 2.2 with little trouble, but I think it would be tougher for them to use Honeycomb.  I got this one to try amazon streaming (which worked) but the TC970 was easy to use and could do almost everything.  If ease of use is a priority, you might consider the 970.  I might change my mind as I get more used to Honeycomb though, it might just seem more confusing having gotten used to one and having to switch.**The Company Le Pan:Like I said above, I have had the TC970 for over 2 months.  I take it everywhere and love it.  The new Le Pan II is replacing it, and my mom is getting my old one.  In the months of using the TC970 I can count the number of resets I had to do on one hand.  I had one booting issue over Christmas weekend.  Tech support for Le Pan opened again on Tuesday morning.  By 9am on Tuesday I got a response to my email for tech support and opened a ticket.  By the end of the day I had my tablet up and running again.  I was impressed with the professional and attentive support I got from Le Pan.  My father's and brother's tablets (also TC970s) have had no tech problems at all.tl,dr:  This is an excellent tablet with top end specs and abilities.  It has played every online video I can throw at it well (including Amazon Prime streaming).  Do not be frightened of the unknown company, I was at first, but the products are great and I have first hand experience with tech support and it was more than adequate.  I cannot recommend this or the previous TC970 enough, especially at the price.The battery life on the original 970 is better than this one (expected since this has twice the processor power), but this one is still what they quote.  Good 7 hours of straight use off of a single charge.  It loses about 1% per hour while asleep.Finally, on the video.  I can run every video I have tried, except Hulu.  Hulu identifies the device as mobile and will not let you play anything (I think this is something on Hulu's end).  I was able to watch Hulu on my old 970 indirectly with Playon, but it requires you to have a computer running the software nearby.  It worked fine though, and I could watch regular Hulu (I do not have Plus to test).  Trying on the 979 it seems to crash when I start the video, I expect it is an issue in Playon's app though, and will follow up with them.  Thus far Hulu is the only online video I can not get to work on the Le Pan II, and that is because it just blocks any mobile device it seems.", "Date": "January 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing for such a low priced tablet!", "Author": "Kristofer Brozio", "ReviewID": "R3423BTJILGGJK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Le Pan TC970 is an excellent Android tablet, I am honestly thrilled with it. It's extremely responsive, never once did I have an issue with it slowing down no matter how many other things were going on. I'm thoroughly enjoying the TC970, and I think you will as well.Aesthetically the TC970 is very pleasing and stylish looking, it's also thin and lightweight. The build quality is excellent, it's a solidly made tablet on par with those much more expensive.I've had the pleasure of testing both the Motorola Xoom and the Samsung Galaxy Tab, and I have to say I like the Le Pan TC970 much better overall. The TC970 doesn't have a Tegra in it but from what I've seen it doesn't need it, it's more than capable a handling anything you can throw at it in terms of apps, games or videos or anything else. I was truly surprised that the 1Ghz CPU could handle everything I threw at it.The most surprising or actually amazing thing is the battery life, no joke here I got over eight hours use while doing a mixture of playing games and browsing the web. I even left I on just sitting and overnight and still had battery left to use it.The TC970 isn't without its problems though, but they're small and not deal breakers. I don't care for the Apple-like USB connection at all, I would have rather seen a standard micro-USB or even mini-USB connector.  The screen is very glossy causing reflections in the correct light and after a few hours of use you'll find the accumulated fingerprints very annoying.The built-in memory is rather small, yes you can put a larger microSD card in it but I would also like to see more built-in memory.The build quality is excellent, but the back is rather slippery honestly, I would have liked it to be more rubberized of textured for a better grip.The other small issue the limited video support, it can't play basic WMV or Divx files.Yes it's running Android 2.2, some people might think that's old and ask why not Gingerbread or Honeycomb. I thought the same thing so I asked them and they told me to expect an update last quarter of 2011 with Ice Cream Sandwich, they told me they decided to skip Gingerbread and Honeycomb and wait until the next major Android release.The camera shows things mirrored or backwards, a major update is supposed to be released any day now to fix it. I got no real explanation as to why the camera was that way in the first place though.The pros and cons are listed below and it might look like a lot of cons but they're small, and not exactly bad things really.Lastly I should mention the price, it's very low for a tablet of this caliber and quality. It's nice to see something this nice at a low price.Pros:+Amazing battery life+Very responsive touch screen+Does work in bright light+Fast and responsive overall+Low price compared to other tablets+Simple to use+Excellent design and construction+Aesthetically pleasing+Viewing from most any angleCons:-Proprietary connector-Screen attracts fingerprints-Glossy screen-Small built-in memory-Back is rather slippery-Can't use in direct sunlight-Limited video formats-Camera is backwards", "Date": "July 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "**WON'T BE ABLE TO UPGRADE TO NEW ANDROID OS (ICS - 4.0)**", "Author": "B. Brinton", "ReviewID": "RBJKI1ZJG2707", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got this tablet back in September and was initially fairly impressed. It looked pretty good, seemed to have a good build quality, had fairly fluid graphics and ran on Android. Plus, even though it was inexpensive, its memory was expandable to 32GB through the micro SD. I talked with their customer service folks before buying, and they explained that although the camera wouldn't actually work with video chat for the time-being, when the new Android OS (4.0) came out it would be able to [Note: I've since been corrected that there is other software and other ways of doing video chat]. As I started to use it I realized that Android 2.2 (aka froyo) is really mainly designed for cell-phones rather than tablets. It doesn't use the screen space very well, doesn't support split pane gmail, and is incompatible with a number of apps you'd would hope to be able to use on your tablet (although I managed to find others that still did most of what I was looking for, it was a pain--particularly given that it was a new product). I also noticed that although my wifi connection was fairly stable at home, it was extremely unstable with my school's enterprise wifi network--a big deal for me since I had bought it mainly for school use. Still, I figured that as soon as I would be able to upgrade to Android 4.0 (ice cream sandwich), the rest of its functionality would be restored.Google released the source code for Android 4.0 (ICS) 2 days ago (Monday 11/14/11). I called Le Pan about the wifi issue today and confirmed that it was probably because of the old OS. I asked when I'd be able to upgrade the OS, and they said that their engineering folks were now saying it would be impossible to upgrade, but that they'd be coming out with a new tablet next year that would support it. I would be stuck with my current OS. I explained how limited the functionality was and how I wouldn't have bought it if they hadn't reassured me that it would soon have the fully functioning OS and asked for a refund. They said they couldn't offer a refund unless it was broken in some way (as opposed to intrinsically broken). Fortunately, after talking with the folks at Amazon they are refunding it (way to pull through, Amazon!).I realize that for some of you this wouldn't be a deal-breaker and am giving it two-stars because it does work for some things. But for those hoping for a cheaper (slightly slower) iPad alternative, I'd say this isn't the android you're looking for.[Note: I realize that I could root it and install a slightly newer OS, but that would void the warranty, and it would ultimately be a dead-end--it would never get to 4.0 or beyond.]", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "First impressions -- beyond my expectations", "Author": "Coffee Infusion \"coffeeinfusion\"", "ReviewID": "R3X4IR6CE1HVS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "[Update as of 2012-04-01 below]I'm in a rush and will hopefully write a more in depth review over time. First impressions:Let it be clear: I'm a first time Android user, and first time tablet owner. I've used an iPhone 3Gs for years and have a number of laptops and desktop workstations. I would say that in computing I'm an advanced user, but not an expert user. I do front-end Web development including coding, so I can figure out most things, but I don't have a degree in networking and usually figure stuff out thanks to our friends at Google. So perhaps don't know too much about computers, but I follow directions reasonably well when things start getting buggy.Why I wanted a Tablet:I like to read PDFs at night and my iPhone screen is just too tiny. Moreover, I like to practice my guitar using online or PDF tab and instruction and well as video instruction. Not only does the laptop create too much distance with the keyboard, but it only allows me to view documents in landscape mode. I felt that an eReader would be best, but I was very unimpressed with the performance of those I tested. I do prefer e-Ink for reading, but the slow processors just killed it for me. I eventually settled on a tablet as it was more versatile. I knew I wanted a monitor that was at least 9\", as most of my documents are in PDF format.Why I didn't buy an iPadAs an iPhone user I was committed to purchasing an iPad after doing a lot of tablet research. I figured that it was the best performer and I already owned many of the apps that would be iPad friendly. However, two things stopped me from taking the plunge. First of all, the iPads are what I consider prohibitively expensive for such a portable device (which I suspect I will eventually sit on, drop, or leave at a cafe by accident). Second, I really, really hate iTunes. It was mostly the iTunes headaches that solidified my decision to go with Android. I'm pretty good with computers and sometimes can't figure out how so many regular computer users seem to get by with iTunes. Don't get me wrong. I think Apple hit a home run with the iPhone. It is ingenious and I love mine -- but it's hard to believe the very same company that created a device so intuitive that it doesn't need a manual -- also created what could be the worst piece of software I've ever used. That would be iTunes. Fortunately, I found an ample iTunes substitute, but it was only after purchasing my Le Pan II.Why I settled on the Le Pan II.I did a lot of research before taking a chance on this one. Read hundreds of reviews and had actually given up on Android (as mentioned -- concluded that Apple was the only player in town) until I found the first version of the Le Pan. I was actually going to pull the trigger on that first model, but I felt the limitation of the OS would eventually become an issue in the app market. The Le Pan II is far more versatile unless you root the old one; something I just don't have time to deal with. I spend a good chunk of my time trying to troubleshoot PC and network errors and don't need another headache.Build Quality: 5 stars.LP II is quite heavy, but the heft has a very solid feel to it; no creaking or cheap feeling parts. Not prohibitively heavy, but it's definitely got some weight.Ease of use: 4 stars.My first real go at Android, and surprisingly it was a no-brainer. Very intuitive. The only reason it doesn't earn 5 stars is because I feel that the app organization is a bit confusing. You can choose to pull the apps onto the carousel sliding start pages, but I don't quite understand why that's necessary. With iOS, all the apps are in your carousel sliding start pages, and you can simply group them together using the drag and drop folder conversion concept -- much more elegant. I also experience some minor bugs when dragging apps to different carousel pages -- sometimes they skip over the destination page, and do other odd things. Not a big deal -- just not as polished as Apple.App installation simplicity: 5 stars.I was a bit concerned about app installation issues with Android, but all of my usual apps such as Evernote, Roboform, Skype, Google Apps and others loaded without a hitch.Speed: 5 stars.I recall testing out a few different tablets months ago at a local Best Buy. This Le Pan II strikes me as being on equal ground with the iPad in terms of response time. It's very responsive.Connectivity: 5 stars.Very simple. Connected to my wi-fi network sans events.Quick first impressions:So far my expectations have been exceeded by this high quality, bang for the buck. I haven't tested everything yet, but it organizes my PDFs and MP4 guitar lessons perfectly -- and so this purchase has been worthwhile. The PDF viewing is a little limited in terms of zoom factor, but I may have overlooked a setting that defines the percentage of zoom, etc. It may also be app related. I have only used Acrobat thus far, but have installed a number of readers.I love the fact that it uses a micro SD. The elastic door that covers the MicroSD is perhaps the only quality control issue -- it doesn't seem to seat flush with the unit, but this does not impact me in any way as long as it doesn't pop open.The keyboard layout takes a little getting used to. Not sure how enamored I am -- only time will tell. I may purchase a small Bluetooth keyboard and give that a whirl for business tasks where I need to do a lot of writing. Haven't found a way to turn off the vibration when I touch the keys -- despite disabling that function in settings. This concerns me because I need to do stealth reading and writing while my wife sleeps.The size is good, but not what I would call perfect. Ideally I would like a larger screen by at least 2 diagonal inches and a thinner, lighter body. That would really make it perfect for reading and reading music. But so far, this is adequate--a world better than both my laptop and iPhone. In time I hope to give long-term user impressions for those of you who want tablets for e-reading. Haven't tried it yet in sunlight but imagine it will make things pretty tough to see. I spend most of my time indoors in a poorly lit computing man-cave.I took the advice of one of the early reviewers and purchased the Targus Truss Case/Stand for HP TouchPad - THZ07202US (Black/Gray) that serves a dual function as a tablet stand. What a great suggestion. First of all, perfect fit, not buttons covered up. The case is so sturdy while supporting the tablet in various angles that I think it's a must-have item.Night readers: take note! If you hold the tablet in Document view, you can use the HP book-like cover as a shield to prevent light spillage from bothering your spouse while reading in bed at night. That right there is a home-run. I know that at least one of you out there is concerned about this issue, and it was hard to find sympathizers on Google. Brilliant solution.Last but not least, the cover of the case is stiff enough that you have ample support for viewing the Le Pan in Document View (whatever the opposite of landscape view is called). Get it.I just can't see paying $500 for a tablet when you can get such a marvelous piece of hardware for this price. I don't think tablets will really hit the mass market until they reach the $200-$300 price point. Le Pan II seems to be ahead of its time.-----------------------------------EDIT: 2012-04-01Despite the date this is serious feedback. No April Fools antics. Just wanted to take a moment and write that I'm still very satisfied with the Le Pan II. It has been a joy to own. That being said, I still believe that iOS is far easier to navigate and the fastest point from A-B. So if money were no object -- now that I have CopyTrans to replace iTunes, I might go with the iPad. But the total upside of the LePan is that Flash video compatibility is ubiquitous, and for my needs that's an important feature. I can access sites with integrated Flash applications, like Songsterr. It's amazing. iOS would be useless for any Web-based Flash apart from Youtube.I did have quite a scare with the Le Pan where I thought it was bricked. I had installed an app from the Android App Store that is a customized app launcher. The Le Pan went into a continuous reboot cycle for two days. I methodically addressed all the variables. Tried the hard reset with Cables in, cables out, etc. Finally performed the reset with the volume button held down, and that did the trick. Immense relief, because it was my last option. I think this is more indicative of Android OS, and nothing to do with Le Pan as a product or brand.One annoyance of the Le Pan II that I have not been able to resolve is another thing that is related to Android OS and not Le Pan itself. This is the hepatic vibration feedback when you push the navigation keys. It's a great feature in general, but when I want to do some stealth reading at night next to my sleeping wife, it's very annoying. Very stupid of Android to make this feature uncustomizable. There is no hack short of rooting the OS that addresses this.Another annoyance that I have fortunately solved is that the screen luminosity could only be reduced by a small amount for night reading. I went through a number of apps and finally came upon one which I will highly recommend to all of you night readers. What makes it great is that you can access it from any screen so if you accidentally disable it and your Le Pan is glowing like a torch while you spazz out to cover it up with the sheets, this app allows you to make a simple swipe gesture with your finger and you're back in dark screen mode.I will warn you that Android allows you to nearly brick your OS by adjusting the screen brightness to zero. So how on earth are you supposed to get your screen visible again if you can't see anything? I had this happen once accidentally while playing with the slider and thankfully I pressed the right place on the screen to get things visible again. Fortunately this app allows you to set a minimum of, say, 3% which gives you enough rendering to see everything you need. Therefore, You can never accidentally make the screen go black.App is called Display Brightness. Free if I recall from the Android store. Once you install the app, just add the widget to your home screen. Now keep this in mind since the widget isn't the most intuitive thing in the world. You need to set your default swiping area. Make sure you give yourself enough adequate area. It's in the form of a vertical strip. You can make that strip thinner or thicker. That attribute is controlled in the app setup screen by the top slider bar called the \"Select Size.\" Once that is enabled and you've tweaked everything perfectly after some trial and error, enable the app by pushing the \"Enable Indicator button on the lower left.\" Now, in whatever screen you may be, you just need to swipe your finger down to reduce the light and up to increase. One word of caution -- there may be a small, innocuous bug. Sometimes you will have apps with menu buttons on the top left of your screen. When you touch them, this disables the Display Brightness, so suddenly you have a glowing torch in the dead of night. Easy fix of course is to just swipe your finger down the left side of the screen again to go back into dark screen mode. This app is the most useful I've found. You will thank me :)If you would like to know about other useful widgets I've found just let me know.Other small annoyances of the Le Pan II. The volume buttons are so integrated into the profile of the Le Pan that I cannot find them with tactile fiddling. This becomes annoying, because in a dark environment you just cannot see them. Once you learn where they are, however, it's not that big a deal.Other than the one Brick scare I had, no other problems. My battery was being consumed like crazy at first until I learned how to manage apps and power consumption. Apple is far more intuitive in this department as well.My original use for this product was instructional guitar videos and guitar tab, and it's been perfect for that application.

I concur with all of them.  The tablet is very nicely done for the cost.  The manufacturer has placed plenty of thought into the construction, components, screen, and other decision making factors involved in developing this product.  Writing another positive review seems redundant, though my excitement really wants to vent.Here are the questions and concerns I had when ordering, hoping they will answer your questions too.1. The tablet took only four days to get here, and yes I ordered during the holidays (week before thanksgiving to be exact).2. The tablet fits nicely into cases designed for the first generation iPads, take your pick on what you like. I took it down to Best-Buy to try it out and see what it fits in.  The cases designed for the older iPads seemed to be perfect.3. Order the screen protector by searching for: POSRUS Antiglare Antifingerprint Screen Protector for Le Pan TC 970, they have it here on Amazon.  It fits perfect.4. It works on the WiFi in my home anywhere in the house, the garage, and on the front terraces. Using a cheap Belkin N router and access point I picked up for less than 40 dollars. I've heard that the devices have better range on Infrastructure networks as opposed to ad-hoc networks, so this might make a difference in the range.  It also works at the McDonald's Wifi, and Starbucks WiFi at the BN bookstore by my house without any problems at all.5. The viewing ratio is perfect for reading books and viewing PDF's.  I am a student, and I read lots of textbooks.  It does a great job with this.  I almost don't want to give it to my son now for Christmas.  Might have to order another one for Dad.6. Yes the screen is a capacitive multi-touch screen.  It works great, and it is very responsive, actually impressive.  It is also very accurate.  The resistive screen on other tablets I've used I felt lucky if I was even close to typing what I wanted.It meets all my expectations, even after ordering it and searching for the couple days afterward for a better deal, I could not find one with this multi-touch screen and viewing ratio near the price I was willing to pay, which was under $225 ($250 including S&H;).Student Note:  If you are thinking of getting this for reading textbooks, it does work great, the 4:3 ratio is better than the widescreen.  It is not very heavy to hold for hours of homework reading, and I recommend getting a small arrowhead type stand (around $15 anywhere including Amazon and Wal-Mart) as it is perfect sitting next to the computer monitor while working on homework.Note about Manufacturer:  The manufacturer lists multiple ways to get hold of them, they answer emails and questions very promptly, and are genuinely eager to help.Note about Skype:  The microphone works, and so does the chat and screen share.  Video does not because of a Skype limitation with Android 2.2.  However there are alternatives that do work.  (oovoo and fring I've been told work, but I have not tried them yet.) !!! Update on Skype !!! Try the new Skype download, it was supposed to fix this limitation with the OS, I already got my Skype working with a modified version.  Search for Modified Skype for Android Froyo and the tablet name, you'll find the download :)Suggestions:  Order a 32gb Micro SD card with it.  (32 is the max it takes, I am sure a 16 or 8 would be fine too...)I searched for one whole week on so many websites I went blind, with my wife glaring at me for the amount of time I spent searching.  This was a great deal, and now having received the tablet (while still searching online at others waiting for it to arrive), I truly feel it was the right and best purchase for me, or um my son's Christmas present... going to have to order another one.UPDATE AFTER USING A LOT! 11/30/2011The one thing that popped up after some heavy use with the tablet over this past week and playing around with all that Android has to offer... this tablet does not have a USB port.  I was able to order an adapter though for the charger cable that is USB female to female, and I will try that out when it gets here.  The power cable has a standard size USB end on one end, and a proprietary connector for charging on the other end, my hope is that with the adapter, I can add that little functionality to it.  The ability to use the USB to play movies would be an outstanding bonus, taking that little micro SD card in and out is just not as easy as USB.  Even with that little need, I am still 100% satisfied about the product.", "Date": "November 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Culmination of a few months search, still a good option against Le Pan II",

It is very similar to my review for the Le Pan II.  In it I show access to Gmail, markets, Kindle, Pictures, music, Browser use with amazon prime streaming (now working apparently), YouTube and the web cam among other things.  The tablet shown is using Build number 4078 for those interested.**There is a newer version for the TC970 at [...]For anyone having technical issues with their tablet, try updating to resolve them.Cases:  The Le Pan I and II are identical size with much of the same hardware.  I have found cases for IPad fit a bit better than HP Touchpad, but both are usable.  The case in this video is CaseCrown Bold Standby case for Apple iPad 2 (Built-in magnet for Apple Smart Cover's sleep & awake) - Black, I use HHI HP TouchPad Folio Flip Case with Muti-Function Stand - Purple (Package include a HandHelditems Sketch Stylus Pen) on mine and both require adjustments to access volume and buttons.  They must also be removed from the case to charge.  My mom uses Targus Truss Case/Stand for HP TouchPad - THZ07202US (Black/Gray) and has none of these limitations, but it is a bit thicker (my mom likes that for more protection), I do not since I put mine in a messenger bag with books on the go and space is a premium.****Comparison of Le Pan I and II:I had this model for 2 months and loved it.  I upgraded to the Le Pan II for amazon prime streaming (which apparently works on both now).  In general the Le Pan II is worth the extra money for newer and stronger capabilities (more online video options in general and newer browser with TABS!).  However, for eReading and basic web surfing the Le Pan I will work for an average user.  If you want higher power for more techie oriented things, I recommend the Le Pan II.  That is if you can find one, most places are sold out and with good reason.My parents (not technie inclined) love theirs and now use them in daily life.  My dad surfs the web quickly and easily from his recliner, and my mom uses hers as basically a large Ipod touch for music and games.  They use them daily and have no complaints.  I do not think they would get any more out of an upgrade to the Le Pan II.I have adapted to my Le Pan II and sadly cannot live without it any more (I could settle with Le Pan I and live).  I use it at all hours of the day to control other devices, surf the web, check email (all can be done just as well from Le Pan I).  The added power of the tablet and browser compared to the Le Pan I was well worth it for me.  I use my computer a lot, and thanks to my Le Pan II there are now days I simply do not turn on my computer at all.If web browsing and email (not a lot of streaming video embedded in pages) is your main focus, the Le Pan I will work fine for your purpose.If accessing all the techie parts of the internet with 6 tabs in your browser is how you surf the web, get the Le Pan II.I understand Netflix works on both with the app for those interested.  The battery life is slightly better on the Le Pan I (half the power so no surprise).  I like the default keyboard on the Le Pan II better, but you can get other keyboards.  I can now type about 70 words per minute on my Le Pan II and it keeps up, the Le Pan I should be able to match that.  In either case both are really great tablets.***Original review:I shall try to avoid repeating what others have put into reviews, and try to be brief despite much praise.  First to explain my culmination comment, I have been searching for a viable tablet to watch online videos, read webpages/email comfortably, and as a small portable media player.  This tablet does all of these things acceptably well or in exemplary fashion, and met my final criterion of not being retardedly expensive.  I picked up a few of the really cheap 7\" tablets.  They did okay, but lacked web video support.  They make good supplemental media players though.  I saw this tablet, and was wary given the unknown name.  However, I took the chance and am very happy I did.  I showed my family, and have now had to get one for my father and brother, too.There are a few notes I would give on top of the given info in other reviews, I agree with pretty much every positive thing said in the other reviews.  This tablet is wonderful, and at an excellent price, but there are a few caveats I have noticed.  These are in no way deal breakers for me given that other tablets of similar quality cost twice as much.Not all online video works, the single core limits the video capacity on non-'mobile optimised' videos.  It usually does fine for the most part on short videos (~10 min or less) but not so well on longer ones.  The videos optimised for mobile play just fine, and I have had no trouble with youtube etc.  The dual core tablets seem to do this fine, but it limits little compared to the price.**Apparently no longer the case see video update**  Tying into the last point it does not stream video from Amazon.com well.  My connection should be fine, but the attempts I have made at watching amazon prime streaming video has been unwatchable from moment one, I hope amazon gets mobile support.  They needn't sell me a kindle fire at a loss by supporting general mobile devices, and it would increase my video rentals.The speakers are actually pretty good for portable devices (almost no portable speakers have good bass, but this is certainly not 'tinny').  A good pair of headphones is a must for audio excellence on a portable device.  I have noted that the sound through my headphones, while certainly above average, is not as good as some other devices (I listen to opera, and you can really tell differences).My Le Pan has been very stable, I have had it 3 weeks and only had to reset it once.I think that is most of the information I have that did not show up in other reviews.  If I think of anything else I shall update this.In conclusion, if you are looking for a great price on a far better than average tablet: get this product.  If you are looking for top shelf, be ready to pay twice this amount or more.**Update**  After 2 months of continual use, my tablet ran into a booting issue.  I sent an email Friday night of Christmas weekend.  The offices were closed until Tuesday (which I pretty much expected).  By 9am PST I received a response email instructing me how to open a ticket so that I could get tech support.  I did so, had a few back and forth comments to go through tech support steps, and by Tuesday evening I had the information I needed to restore my tablet to perfect function.  I am now enjoying my tablet once more.  I got so addicted to this thing that I was very eager indeed to get it back up and running.  The other TC970 tablets I got for my father and brother are still running perfectly.  I am excited about the upcoming Le Pan II to be released in early January.update tl;dr  I needed tech support and got it in a professional and expedient fashion, my experience with company interaction has been emphatically positive.", "Date": "November 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "For those who pre-ordered Le Pan II tablet.......Docked 3 stars for instability and lack of customer support.", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2HCQWAYMA3NC6", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Just to update some of you who pre-ordered this item and are wondering on its release date.I pre-ordered mine on December 16th and just received an e-mail from Amazon that it is in transit with 2-day prime shipping.

Very fast response on everything I do, from video, to reading, to office, to downloading, gaming, in car GPS with no need for wi-fi, etc.  To say the least, this will be a very hot item, let me just say.For the pre-order price of thirteen bucks over the Nook Tablet, this thing is heads above everything else in this price range.  Very clear and crisp IPS panel screen with 1024 x 768 and it shows.Android Honeycomb 3.2.1 is very responsive and with a 32GB lexar class 10 card (Lexar High Speed MicroSDHC 32 GB Class 10 Flash Memory Card with Reader LSDMI32GBSBNAR) and all that screen real estate, I am set for a long, long time.  Just what I was looking for, not to big (10.1\" screen) and not too small (7\" screen).  I feel the aspect ration of 4:3 is actually preferable to me, a la ipad.One note, if you want a great case at a very low price of less than ten bucks with great protection and stand built in, you must get the CaseCrown Hard Case (Black) for the Apple iPad 2 Wifi / 3G Model 16GB, 32GB, 64GBI got one and it fits perfectly.  Dual zippers allow for charging of the tablet while in the case without removing it...!!! Love my new Le Pan II and hope you do as well...!!!!!Regards...::: Updated 1/14/12 :::Well, I had my hopes too high, I guess, for this to be a great tablet.  I used it for 4 days and on the 5th, after a system update, the tablet turned on, the wi-fi started giving me issues, the screen started to flicker, BADLY, and then I could not turn it off.  I thought I would let it sit overnight until discharged and then I would plug it in and recharge it.  WRONG..!!!!Tablet is DEAD.  I contacted LePan customer support and after 4 days of back and forth correspondence, they could not figure out what was wrong.  I tried their instructions on factory reset, hard reset and power button and down volume toggle.  NOTHING, NOTHING, NOTHING.  Their response finally was: I guess we can send you a new one to replace, but you'll have to wait a month.  Maybe that one will be better......REALLY GUYS..?????  Come on.  Customer Service should be a bit more experienced and helpful, especially, since you're a new company trying to launch a new product on to a crowded market.  Regardless, I think I'll keep looking.

I did have it ordered from Amazon, but with the '2-3 weeks' back order, I switched to Walmart.com and got it for a buck cheaper.  Downside is, I had to pay about $20 in tax.  Still, I ordered on Friday afternoon, so you can't beat that.  I'll provide a list of things I didn't like, so just assume that I was satisfied with the aspects that aren't on the list.  I bought this tablet for it's guts.  I wanted to break that performance barrier for Android devices.  I didn't want a toy, but the inconsistencies among Android devices is frustrating.  So far, the Le Pan 2 is performing like a tool.  Remember, this is a review after about 4 hours of face time, so think of it more as a first impression.Dislikes:Power Button - Difficult to locate in the dark until you get the feel.  Even then, it feels cheap, and the design makes it hard to tack down once you do find it.  The mechanism that maintains the tension underneath the button doesn't do a great job, so the button feels a little floaty and lose.  This is not a deal breaker for me.Volume rocker/hold button(s) - The hold switch is garbage.  If you shake the Tablet, it rattles on it's track.  There seems to be a reoccurring theme with Le Pan (Matsunichi) and moving parts.  The Volume rocker which is adjacent to the hold switch is hard to locate period partly because of their proximity.  A blind feel yields mostly distinguishable plastic segments.  The rocker could benefit from raised bumps on either end.  It's nice not to have the face of the tablet muddled with lights and indications, but it makes physically turning the tablet to view the controls on top an occasional necessity.  Annoying, but not a deal breaker.Honeycomb Fever/Disillusionment - I use Android 2.3.3 on my phone, so I've gotten used to the long comparability list.  Honeycomb is not supported by some apps I use on my Droid Pro.  HBOgo is in the works.  Xfinity, Fios, etc.  More annoying is that HBO denies browser access to on demand content for Tablets.  I'm sure there is a way around this, but like I said before, 4 hours.  I've read that ICS is coming in an update, so they're about to shake the snow globe again anyway.  Not Le Pan's fault, but we should be aware. (I would like my gmail, please)Comfort - I'm not using the Tablet with a case yet, so this point serves only those who plan to keep the Le Pan naked.  The 9.7 inch format is nice to look at, but cumbersome to hold.  The weight gets to the small tendons and muscles after a few minutes and calls for constant readjustment.  The case is slick, so if you stop paying attention to the tablet resting on your leg, a drop is probable.  If you plan on putting it in a case, no worries.Camera - Not much needed here.  It's a 2MP that reminds me of a cheap webcam...  That's essentially what it is.  No flash.  Literally.  I don't intend to use my tablet for digital photography anyway.  Don't we all high MP digi cams in an expensive case somewhere that we don't use?  Feel free to go find it. :-PCharging - 30pin connector STINKS!  The included cable is short.  The charge slot is on the TOP of the device (True north, above the camera, offset to the left 2 inches).  This is that lack of refinement I was talking about.  I'm sure there's a good excuse for why is has to be there.  Probably something like 'It was convenient'.  Not that anyone wants to use a tethered tablet, but if you have to, it's annoying.  Charging also seems slow.  Second full charge was 4-5 hours.  Maybe I'm spoiled.Speakers - The quality is as expected, and maybe even a little better.  the problem I had was with the placement and volume.  They are on the back cover, and sit at the bottom of the tablet during portrait mode.  If you cover the small openings, the volume is killed.  If you want to experience quasi-stereo, you can't be using landscape mode.  Also, the volume is different depending on which application you're using.  System volume is also inconsistent.  20% may sound appropriate for 20%, but 70% sounds like 50%, and 100% sounds like 55%.  Better to use inside, as the sound is lost in open spaces.Screen - I don't even want to admit this, but I did notice some bleeding in the corners.  One in particular.  It only shows with dark/black screens.  It's very small.  If I hadn't read a review of someone else making the same claims, I wouldn't have noticed right away.  I DO NOT mean to scare people away from this tablet.  The screen bleeding is not significant.  It may even be covered under warranty, but I'm not sure.  Maybe someone has time to check into that.  Still not a deal breaker for me.  Sub $300 people.Conclusion:I like this Tablet, even if I sound hyper-critical of it.I haven't had any crashes yet.  Bloatware is at a minimum (or just not present).  Operation is snappy, but there are the occasional hick-ups and motion lags.  Wifi pickup seems great (better than my Droid Pro).  It's sturdy, but husky in comparison to some of the anorexic tabs out there.  Get a case for it.  I will be doing the same.", "Date": "January 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "A great first Tablet", "Author": "EdBianc", "ReviewID": "R3HCW9W5CTAUHK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had my TC970 for 3 weeks and it has been a very reliable system.

Firefox seems to have a problem with displaying flash media and I could not get their sync feature to work across my tablet to PC. Another good browser is Dolphin.

Doesn't happen all the time, but it can get annoying when I need to check my callendar or something like that. I don't think any tablet will be perfect (or any electronic, for that matter), you just have to figure out what features are most important to you & go with it. My husband has an android phone & it is SUPER handy to share documents, callendar events, shopping lists, & so many other things. If you have the right apps, it can be a huge time saver. My husband & I can focus on more important things than arguing about the shopping list, how much money we have- or have spent, the plans for this weekend, or our daughters' physical therapy schedule. :)I've been shopping for a tablet for about 10 months now and I was agonizing over it because I am a mother & it is super hard for me to spend money on myself.

You can get your choice of off-brand 7 inch screens with bad reviews and a lot of trouble setting them up. You can get a \"Fire\" with a lot of functionality and good reviews while still being limited to a 7 inch screen. The savvy consumer, however, can take a little more time in their research and stumble across the Le Pan, as I did.I was looking for a little bit of everything on a budget. I wanted to have a backup computer just in case my laptop left me stranded. Having 4 home businesses I really shouldn't limit myself to just one computer and smart phone. I also wanted something for my girls to play all their favorite games on so I could have my phone back. We're already comfortable with Android OS so I wanted to stick with it and keep things simple. I was having some heartburn over purchasing anything with a 7\" screen so I kept looking. When I found the Le Pan I knew it would fit my needs perfectly. Initially it was priced at about $250 but something told me that I needed to wait for the price to drop. Earlier this week the price dropped and I grabbed it straight through Amazon!I just received it yesterday- love that quick shipping! It worked great right out of the box. I plugged it in and immediately got it hooked up to my wifi with ease. I think it helps if you already have a Google account (gmail). As soon as I was online I opened the Android Market and started downloading our favorite Apps. Seriously- this thing is ready to work for you right out of the box! It's highly intuitive so you don't have to worry about being a guru to figure it out. There are also some on-screen tutorials and prompters if you need them. Within minutes my girls were playing games and I had a big smile on my face. I knew I made the right decision getting the Le Pan.Let me tell you this thing is sexy! So sleek and thin, it's just pretty to look at. The screen clarity is phenomenal and the responsiveness is great. I played around with the settings last night and was pleased with the options I have to personalize it. It finally got a chance to fully charge overnight and we've been enjoying Angry Birds all morning before switching over to the more adult activities of testing the browser and checking email. Now that I know it's a winner, I'll look for a good protective case and screen protector. As much as I would prefer to show off her beauty, I have to protect her from the girls (3 & 4 yrs old).Bottom line: I highly recommend the Le Pan and can't imagine having gotten better value for my money.

A couple of weeks ago, the power button suddenly stopped working, apparently a common issue. I submitted a trouble ticket, but have yet to hear back, which apparently is happening to others as well. I could live with the fact that it wasn't really as good as an ipad and that it wasn't going to get any further android upgrades, but it's pretty apparent Le Pan isn't committed to supporting this product.Some of my own expectations changed along the way too. I bought it with the main intent of using it as an ereader and not much else.  Well, once you get a tablet you eventually start to explore its media options, but this one wasn't up to the task. It's hard for me to say if failures were a result of tablet hardware, the android OS, or the apps, but simple stuff like browsing the web was imperfect due to app crashes, slowness, etc. Like I said, assigning blame is tough, but I'm now a bit leery of the Android OS and the apps designed for that OS. I'm an iphone user, so I'm used to things (mostly) working smoothly, and Android just seems half baked in comparison.So, I'm parting ways with this tablet and probably going with an ipad. I probably could have lived with this if the power button hadn't broken, but this episode made me realize that sometimes settling for something isn't worth it.Original review: This is the first time I've really felt compelled to write a review, only because the reviews helped me come to a decision on this particular product.  I was in a position where I didn't really want a tablet; I have a desktop, laptop, and iphone that provide enough for my tech needs.  But I recently moved and am in a position where I am riding a train to work, and I am currently working on PhD research, so hauling binders worth of articles isn't practical.  So, I thought of getting an ereader to help ease the burden.Going back to my original thought of not wanting a tablet, that really drove my decision making. At first, I was only looking at your garden variety 6\" e-readers, but my articles have lots of tables, so I worried how pdf's would convert to e-reader format (I've read that software is very hit or miss). The 10\" kindle seemed like it would hit the spot, but it's pricey for a rather specialized product.  The 7\" tablets seemed ok, but a little too small for the multicolumn articles I read. I thought that the only way to go would be the ipad.But a little more searching yielded this product, which obviously has some good reviews (some not so good too).  It seemed like a no-brainer, get the size and functionality I need at a price that won't leave me feeling too guilty. So I've had this a couple of days, so I may amend this review later, but so far it's working great. Of course, given my need, the first thing I fired up was the adobe reader and looked through a few of my articles.  Essentially like reading them on printed paper, which is what I wanted. I haven't had any freezing issues (yet) and upgraded to the latest firmware to be safe.Although I'm giving this 5-stars (it does everything I want and need), there is one caveat. The screen, while great in terms of size, is not nearly as responsive as the ipad's. But it works, and I'm hoping it'll be a great resource for my research. Like I said, this product seems to be the perfect combination of price and features.New addition 2/17/2012: Having used this for a few weeks, I can confirm that it's still a great product. I've made some minor tweaks, I've rooted the tablet to gain more control and access to different apps.  I've installed an LCD Density adjuster to gain a little more screen real estate, and Launcher Pro, to resolve a minor annoyance of the home screen not rotating with the stock Launcher. Even without those tweaks, though, I was quite happy with it.  As with anything tech related, you can always make changes here and there to suit your preferences.For the more tech saavy and adventurous users, you'll be happy to know that folks in the XDA community are almost done with work that will allow LePan users to install Gingerbread on the TC970.  Go to lepanlife dot com for more info on that. I'm on the fence of whether to try it or not, Froyo works fine for me, but there may be some apps where I might need Gingerbread or higher.", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Upgrading from 2 stars to 4 stars.  Here's why...", "Author": "B. Willis", "ReviewID": "R3EKSE1I0338XX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've mostly been impressed with this tablet.  However, a few months ago, the tablet went into an endless cycle where it would not boot, but instead just displayed the LePan logo, attempted to boot, failed and repeated the cycle indefinitely.  The reset button did no good either.  I contacted LePan and after having me try this and that, asked me to send the unit in for replacement.I did just that and was very impressed by their 1 day turnaround.  However, a few months later, the replacement unit is doing the exact same thing!  It's completely unusable and just cycles on and off in a continuous boot loop while displaying Le Pan and clicking about once each 5 seconds or so.  Very annoying.  Not sure what's up, but having 2 units fail with the same problem makes me question the quality of the product.There are certainly things to like about it, and if it wasn't for the problems I've had, I'd continue to rate it 5 stars.  But presumably I'll soon be on my 3rd tablet and I find that to be unacceptable.Update Apr 19, 2012: A month or more ago, the unit magically started working properly once again.  It's basically a nice tablet, but I have had some problems with it, as noted below.Update Feb 22, 2012: As mentioned, I've received my 3rd tablet now.  I noted that the tablet received did not receive the most current software upgrade, so I upgraded the OS as per LePan's website.  At first, everything worked fine and my apps began loading via Amazon's Android App Store & the Android Market.  However, after a few apps loaded onto the unit *nothing* would install from any source.  I simply got an \"installing\" message that would not go away.  I could use the other functions of the tablet, but nothing would install.  I contacted LePan (again) and was told to reinstall the operating system, which is a hassle, plus I just set up all of my e-mail addresses and such.  I'll do that when I get a chance, but for now I'll continue to maintain my 2-star rating.My original review, which initially gave this unit a 5-star rating, follows:I was a bit skeptical about this tablet.  After all, I'd never heard of the name Le Pan and it sounds like a cheap knock-off.  But I have to tell you that it's a terrific tablet.This tablet probably has the most vivid display I've seen on any computer, including my far more expensive Fujitsu models.  The screen can be viewed from nearly any angle and is simply excellent.  Videos played on YouTube looked great and with no studder and some of the sample photos bordered on amazing.  The live desktop is nice and there are some cool options offered and a lot of customization available in nearly every area.It incorporates Android 2.2, which I've never used, but it's pretty easy to figure out.  In fact, there are minimal instructions that come with the unit, but it's pretty intuitive.It was simple to connect the tablet to my WiFi.  The operating system is fast and snappy, moving between applications without lag.  Many functions can be operated via voice command.  GPS is very cool and includes photographic maps.  The Le Pan TC970 synced quickly and easily with my e-mail and Google contacts.  I downloaded Skype and was able to make high-quality phone calls without hassle.This tablet has a front camera that isn't fantastic but seems decent enough.  Sound quality is also good enough for a unit of this size and the battery life seems excellent.  Downloading applications from the Android Market or Amazon was fast and easy and there are countless free applications.  Most games without issue on the thing.The unit is small and compact.  I think that many cases which fit an iPad2 could potentially fit this unit, as the sizes are similar.  The Case Logic case I am currently using is a near perfect fit, although it does require minor modification.  I used a hobby knife (similar to an exacto knife, but more precise) and cut a bit of the case's vinyl material away from the Le Pan's controls.  I also cut out a small rectangle around the camera lens.  I recommend drawing the outline of where you want to cut in pen before you do so, so you get it right the first time.  I did not cut out material around the charging port, as I just leave part of the flap open when charging, but I suppose you could do that if you wanted to.  If you'd like to take a look at this case, just search Amazon for Case Logic IFOL-202 iPAD2 Folio (Black)This tablet incorporates multi-touch and it's simple to use and completely accurate.Concerns?  Well, I had difficulty reaching customer support (855-537-2672).  I called the phone number provided and it said, \"For Polaroid press 1, for everything else press 2\".  I did that and the line rang and rang maybe 20 before finally telling me that the extension was not available.  Plainly, there needs to be improved support for a $350 tech product.  Also, the company's website, which is lepantab and you know the rest of the address, seems to be pretty simplistic without a lot of info.  I'd like to see that improved.  Finally, I'm not sure if the battery is user replaceable.  I'd ask the company, but so far I'm having difficulty reaching them.  I'll update this info once I have an answer.  Finally, the included documentation is lacking, in my view.  It's essentially nothing but a 2 sided quick start guide the size of a postcard.  While it's pretty easy figuring out how to use this tablet, some form of an owner's manual would be helpful.But all-in-all, I really like this tablet.  I'm not sure what an iPad can do that this can't, but I'm guessing not much.  I highly recommend this tablet and I suspect it's one of the best Android tablets on the market.Additional information: After I wrote this review, I tried out GPS.  To do this, I spoke to the tablet, verbally telling the it to navigate to my office address (to do this \"navigate to\" is the command).  It worked well, although the highly detailed, Google photo overlay only worked for a few miles before it reverted to a simple map image.  Still, it did get me to the office.  I then tried to route myself back home via GPS.  Because I didn't have a wifi connection, I was unable to do that.  So you can load a route via wifi and it will get you to where you are going, but you must also have wifi to begin a new route.  However, you don't have to have a connection once the route is loaded, if that makes sense.I have a Bluetooth speakerphone which broadcasts to FM stereo.  I was able to stream music and the GPS computer spoken commands through my FM stereo via the tablet's Bluetooth function as well as routed through my Bluetooth speakerphone.I also called Le Pan customer service this morning and received a call back this afternoon.  She said that the battery is not user replaceable, although that is common with units of this type.  I also asked about the custom case with stand that is made for this unit, but she didn't seem to know much about that.Even more information:  I received an e-mail from Le Pan customer service today.  Their cases are not yet available, but they said that many iPad cases might fit, as the devices are of a similar size.

If the iPad is the industry standard with a 9.7 inch screen, 4:3 ratio(Full Screen), why in the world would the vast majority of Android tablets introduced as 10 inchers be in a 16:9 widescreen ratio? Why is this important? Because although nice to view in landscape mode, they are awkward to view in portrait mode (at best). Whereas, a screen with the same size as the iPad (9.7 inch, 4:3 ratio), is pleasant to view in both angles. This is where the Le Pan tc970 comes in. It is the perfect screen size to surf the web and read eBooks in. Here are a few pro's and cons:Pros: Screen Size, Quality, and RatioAndroid 2.2Fits with most Ipad 1st Generation CasesTry this Case: Targus Truss Case/Stand for Apple iPad 16GB, 32GB, 64GB WiFi + 3G, iPad 2 THZ06103US (Black/Blue)Le Pan has solid SupportCons: No upgrade to ICS 4.0Android 2.2Screen Resolution - (Everything looks big(Sort of like staring at your Android Phone, But Magnified)No access to Android ADB USB Drivers to access via ADB, and try rooting.No widely available root method.Android 2.2 is a very stable OS, and you can tell they really optimized it for this hardware. The screen is very snappy and responsive unlike any other Android tablet out there that I have tried out. Honeycomb stinks in my opinion anyhow. Google actually admitted that it was rushed out as a stop gap to ICS 4.0 anyhow. So, I'll take 2.2/2.3 over Honeycomb on a tablet. The argument many make is 2.2 was not designed for tablets. It's alot snappier and smooth than 3.X Honeycomb though.So, I am not too sure why most Android tablet vendors put out the wide screen tablets, but they should probably try taking a cue from the iPad and offer the 4:3 9.7 inch screen. So far, most obscure Chinese tablets you see on ebay with this size are trash. This Le Pan is a rare good one. Another good one that seems to be on the way is made my arnova, that is yet to be released called the Arnova 9 G2.But, I highly reccomend it. Especially at the current price of $200.

It has a beautiful display, is fairly light, and has good battery life.  The processor seems well-suited for what I've used it for: email, Facebook, and Angry Birds!  I didn't experience much in the way of lag or delay, it seemed to chug right through whatever I threw at it.  The speakers are good, not great; I would have preferred the headphone jack to be on the side or bottom instead of the top.Now for my complaints:I've experienced some edge bleed, white light shining through at the edge of the screen.  Not a big deal most of the time, but always noticeable.  Could just be this unit, or it could be a sign of poor quality control.Doesn't play Netflix, though the application can be downloaded. I've seen previous reviews say you can manipulate the software to play it, but that's more that what the average user will want to do - or should have to do.  If the Le Pan played Netflix, I would have given it another star.It won't stay asleep!  Pushing the power button once will put the unit to sleep, but not power it off.  This is the way my other Android devices have worked as well.  The difference: The Le Pan will turn itself back on after a minute.  It can be sitting on a table, asleep, and it will wake itself up.  It's really just annoying, because it'll catch my eye and distract me - something I resolve by powering off, but it could lead to battery life issues down the road.Not a fan of the power connector.  I think they're commonly referred to as \"10-pin connector\", but being that the other end is USB, I don't know why they couldn't have just made it mini or micro USB for ease of charging.All in all, it's a good tablet, especially considering the price point.

I have played with many tablets at the store and with friends, but this is the first one I ever bought and owned.In my opinion, this is the best tablet for the price.  It comes equipped with Android 3.2 Honeycomb, and it is a joy to use.The screen is responsive and clear, and I love typing on it.I would advice getting a case or something to prop it up a bit, it makes typing much more enjoyable.The battery life is good, lasting anywhere from 5 to 8 hours of continual use, maybe more if wifi is turned off.It has 8GB of memory built in, with up to 32GB via a micro SD card.This is more than fast enough for my needs, which are internet browsing, streaming movies, Youtube, some online shopping, etc...I am not a real techy person, and probably don't use 90% of what this tablet can do, but for me it is perfect.Now, for some of the negative reviews you may have heard.  Yes, the company that makes this tablet is rather shady in my opinion.  They don't seem to follow through with their promises, however there is some light at the end of the tunnel.I was able to join a very useful forum at [...]There are some great people over there who are dedicated to making the most out of this tablet, and it's predecessor, the TC970.As of today, the company has not released Android 4.0 ICS for this device, like they said they would.  They have also not released any of the information necessary for private developers to do what they do to make custom versions of ICS for this device.  However, through that forum that I mentioned, there seems to be some headway being made, it is starting to look like the company is going to be releasing ICS any day now.In my opinion, ICS is not that much of an improvement over Honeycomb, but the point is that the company made it seem like this device would be easily up-gradable to ICS, and it is easily up-gradable, but they have to release the OS for us to upgrade to.There also seem to be some issues with people not having HDMI output available, and a lack of accessories for this device, but all in all, I have not been bothered by those things.There are some people who have wifi issues with this device, I am not one of them.  My device has worked flawlessly everywhere I have tried to get a wifi signal.There are some issues with this device and the Youtube app buffering constantly.  This was taken care of for me by updating the flashplayer, and by getting a wireless-n router.  This device seems to like that router better, it was a cheap $30 router that I got.  I will say that it makes sense for the youtube app to need a lot of bandwith to function properly.  The resolution for HD videos on this device rivals my desktop screen.This review is for those people who are simply looking for a tablet to use to browse the internet, watch some movies, and play some games.The Google Play market is awesome, tons of free apps, and some really great paid ones as well.  If you are an uber geek/techy person, this product will probably not be for you.  I can easily see someone like that getting frustrated that they can't have the latest and greatest OS right away.  For me, Honeycomb is polished and clean, and a joy to use.  So if ICS never comes out for this tablet it's not a big deal to me.I do think the people at the forum will eventually be able to get all the information they need to start making customer software for this device to help it perform even better, but even right out of the box it is great.", "Date": "May 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Android Tablet", "Author": "Dan", "ReviewID": "R3CC3V5J45EQWE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I read reviews for days before buying this tablet. I almost did not buy it because of all the complaints of the freezing up. I have been using mine for four days now without a problem. I did have a couple of applications that froze while downloading, but I stopped the download and restarted it and they downloaded fine. I had another android tablet called a Superpad. We had it for almost a year until my wife dropped it and broke the power plug. It was not very good and kept locking up. We replaced it with a Superpad II. We could never get it to work so we sent it back. We finally bought an iPad II. My wife loves the iPad II. It is a great tablet but I prefer an android OS. It does not have the same app market, did not have expandable memory and is difficult to work with documents. In short I love its appearance and speed but did not like its functionality, also many of the apps that I love are not available on iPad. I think the android market has much more to offer. I have never been a fan of iPhone or iPad because of their proprietary market. This is not an iPad and I am thankful for that. I like this much better because of what I can do with it. If you are just playing games and surfing the Internet then and iPad is fine. If you want a business tool this one is great. And all for the price of a Kindle Fire.I'm going to do something no one else has done. I am going to compare this to an iPad II from a non-technical point of view. Please bear in mind you can buy three of these for the price of one iPad.Size. This is slightly smaller than an iPad II in exterior dimensions, therefore an iPad II case fits loosely. The width is about the same, but the height is almost a quarter inch shorter. The thickness is about the same. I bought a Targus Truss case for iPad and it does not fit well. I am ordering one for HP Touchpad which according to the reviews will fit better.Battery. I have not watched movies on either device so I cannot comment on that. However for web surfing they are about the same. My battery app indicates over 10 hours of web surfing time. After yesterday I can testify that is pretty accurate. If you can run the battery down on this then your spending too much time on a tablet. I cannot imagine a situation where you would have to recharge during the day. It stayed right there with the iPad II all day yesterday.Screen. I cannot tell the difference in the quality of this compared to the iPad II. Yes the screen is shiny and so is the iPad. They both show fingerprints unless you use a stylus. Screen protectors help but I do not like them, no matter how good they are they take away from the quality of the display. The touchscreen is very responsive but did not work well with the stylus. This may be because of the quality of the stylus that I had. I don't know why people complain about shiny screens. They are on all of your phones and all of your tablets. Get over it. They all have the same problems.Brightness. I compared this to the iPad II while out in the car. You could not see either screen unless you were in the shade. You can see fingerprints on both in the reflection. The iPad might have been a tiny bit brighter. I have the same problem with my phone in bright light. These devices do not work well outdoors. It is a limitation of all devices. Again get over it. The only thing that works outdoors is a Nook or a Kindle with E ink technology.Screen orientation. There are some apps that will not rotate. I have the same problem on the iPad when there is not an iPad app available and you have to use one for an iPhone. This is not an operating system problem, it is a problem with the app developer. Any developer can develop their app for screen rotation if they want to. The only thing I can say about this product is that the home screen only displays in landscape mode. However, this is the way that most people use a tablet and I don't see why this would be a problem for anyone. I noticed that HBO go and Max go only display the menu in vertical mode. The movies play in landscape mode just like the iPad. This is a minor inconvenience to have to turn the tablet to read the menu. How lazy are we getting?Speed. This might be a little hard to believe,but I think it is faster than the iPad. My wife uses the iPad more than I do, so I had her watch over my shoulder while I did several tasks and she agreed it is really fast. I am not going to say it is faster than an iPad II, but I think it is.30 pin connector. While the internal pin connector appears to be the same the exterior housing is different than the iPad. You might be able to force it but why would you do that. I do not know why some reviewers would say that they would work. Le Pan shows them on their website for $4.00. Amazon should offer this cable if they are going to sell this product. I think this is a problem. However, the cable is well made and I do not plan on ordering a replacement.GPS. The GPS works great. This is not even available on the iPad II with Wi-Fi. You have to get a 3G iPad in order to use GPS or order a separate GPS unit that will work with iPad. The iPad will not connect to a standard Bluetooth GPS. Again, another reason to not like their proprietary software from Apple.Printing. There are only a few wireless printers that will work with an iPad. Again, because of the proprietary software. All you need with this tablet is an app like Printershare to print to any Wi-Fi printer. Just one more reason not to buy an Apple product.In short, you can tell I do not like Apple products. They are great product and I wish they were compatible with the rest of the world. I still own an iPad and we love it, but it is the only one I will ever own because it is so limited. I will never own an iPhone because there are so many android options available now.If you have a MacBook and an iPhone, then you should buy an iPad.If you have a PC, any other android devices or an android phone then you will probably not be as happy with an iPad as you would be with a nice android tablet. You might like an HP Touchpad, but it is actually more like a laptop and is not an android. I think that for the price this tablet is hard to beat. I think I will continue to use this one for a while then upgrade it to a Le Pan II or III. For right now I am happy with the performance of this tablet.

This is so much easier to add your music or movies etc. Just connect to your computer and drag n drop. As far as I know this is one of the few Android tablets in the 4:3 aspect ratio which is so much better than 16:9 for web browsing.  I couldn't be happier with this tablet.

My first was the 7in Velocity Cruz which performed admirably as an e-reader and not so well as a tablet entertainment device.What this tablet does that no other Android tablet seems to do based on peoples reviews, be it honeycomb,gingerbread, Viewsonic,WoPad, Archos or whatever, is work perfectly right out of the box! Mine was delivered with firmware update 4431 in place and android market ready to roll!Why does Apple cost so much, because it's worth it and because it WORKS out of the box! And so does my Le Pan 9 days later running 12 apps. Not including games: Kindle, Craigslist, Amazon App store (i prefer to android), and a fully functional NETFLIX...Yessss. My email accounts were a breeze and contacts went right in without me even realizing until 2 days later. And let me tell you, the internet is awesome. Dolphin browser is the way to go! The Kindle App looks just like what the Fire appears to be, nook style lower pane with a graphical cover up top.I paid $269 w/ free shipping for my Le Pan. The machine runs so smooth. I am not a computer guy, though i know enough to get around. For me it's time. I don't have a lot of it, so messing with a tablet for a few hours isn't my idea of a good time. My guess as to why this tablet works so well (see other reviews), is that the hardware matches the capabilities of the software better than most other \"Droid\" devices. I have no desire to upgrade to Honeycomb, ginger bread or even ice cream cookie. This device runs so smooth already, why mess with it.There are a couple of Caveats the buyer should be aware of. the 30pin charging cord is proprietary and NOT swap-able with Apple, 2. No HDMI out, 3. Unknown Brand. For me the HDMI is not an issue. The cord was a bit of a let down though. I contacted Le Pan, (Matsunichi Digital USA) and arranged to purchase 2 OEM cords and 2 OEM USB charging plugs for  $28 dollars total, including the shipping! LOLI bought an APPLE Ipad Leatherette folding folio/stand by Targus from Best Buy and of course a 16 Gig drive. The small power button a lot of people complain about is really no big deal especially since it fits snugly under the hold down elastic without turning the unit off.Overall you can tell I am pleased with this device.

Frankly, the majority of the tablets currently on the market are (IMO) either 1. over-hyped and outrageously expensive, or 2. substandard and not worth the the materials used to put them together.  I thought I'd try one more time, since I wanted something other than a laptop to browse the internet and e-mail, as an color e-reader for magazines and such (the Kindle is normally my go-to e-reader, but for magazines is not adequate), and a few games here and there.  The Le Pan was a pleasant surprise!  Sharp, vibrant, with an amazing viewing angle, it did not disappoint.Customer service has verified that there will be an Ice Cream Sandwich update, and were very helpful in getting the latest build and update installation instructions to me (build #4431 at this writing).  I haven't found the power button problematic, though some have mentioned it.As one reviewer noted, the Targus Truss Leather Carrying Case with Stand for Apple iPad 16GB, 32GB, 64GB WiFi and WiFi + 3G  THZ02201US (Beige/Green Interior) is an almost perfect fit.

Easy to set up, as soon as I entered my network password, the tablet connected right away.  I wish a full size instruction manual was included other than just a quick start manual.  Once you get the tablet set-up, there IS a tablet tutorial buried down under \"Settings\".  But it would still be nice to have a full instruction manual available as a pdf download from their web site.The screen is incredible, from the bright colors, relatively large viewing surface, similar in size to an iPad or a netbook screen.  I have a 4th generation iPod touch with Retina Display and comparing them side-by-side, this Le Pan tablet looks very similar, but even better since it's larger and I have no trouble seeing it!  And compared to my netbook, let's just say there is NO comparison.  The netbook will be put away in a drawer for now.HERE'S MY GPS EXPERIENCE:Sitting out in my driveway, I decided to take a drive to see how the GPS works.  I pressed the Navigation Icon.  You have a choice of typing in the destination or speaking.  I chose speaking, so I said \"_____ Golf Course\". After a few seconds, a lady's voice started telling me the directions turn by turn as I was driving, it seemed to be tracking me as the distances to my next turn were spot on.  (Later, I realized my wi-fi connection was reaching my parked car in the driveway.)  The GPS gave one incorrect street name, and it took me to the driving range of the golf course instead of the main entrance 1/2 mile away on the other side.  Once I passed the entrance where it told me to turn, the lady said \"data collection lost\".  For the return trip back to my home, I was unable to connect to get return directions until I drove to a nearby McDonald's with wi-fi.  So, it does work, sort of.  I have never used a dedicated GPS unit in my car, but I'm sure those don't require wi-fi.  So my advice is:  Don't buy this just for the GPS.  Also, there is no place to mount it, so I had it laying on the passenger seat and I was afraid it might go flying if I had to stop suddenly.WARRANTY:The web site seems to get updated daily.  There is now a warranty which is one (1) year no charge for parts and labor from date of purchase. Not valid if the product is modified, altered or opened.

It comes with a screen protector installed - it had some small bubbles that I had to squeegee out.> The speakers have fairly decent sound quality.> For a 1 Ghz processor, it's faster than I thought it would be at web browsing.> Works with web sites that use Adobe Flash (iPad does not).> Keyboard is easy to use, no stylus needed (at least for me!)> Plenty of Android Market apps to choose.CONS:> The screen is nice and shiny but it's impossible to use outdoors on a sunny day for all the reflection.> Customer Support.  Everything works great at the moment, but may not 6 months from now.  There's not much at the web site, but there is a forum.  I'm not sure who is moderating it, whether it is Le Pan technical support or not.  I would also like to know what happens when the battery needs replaced.  Will Le Pan still be around to provide this service down the road?I anguished over a star rating for hours - should this get 4 stars or 5?  The kinks need worked out as far as customer support goes, so 4 stars for now.  I think lack of name-recognition also may hurt sales of this tablet.

I build PC's and repair them and have never had a company totaly ignore my request for support, so I thought there must be some exageration in some of the reviews. Unfortunatly I was wrong. I have emailed the company over a week ago with no response. Calling them will also result in an unanswered call. If you do decide to purchase this item in spite of the warnings of the lack of customer support, I wish you luck and hope you get one that is not faulty. I have read that if you do receiva a Le Pan TC 970 that works, they seem to be a fairly good product. However I did not receiva a working one and am unable to provide a review on the tablet. Fortunatly you will not have to deal with Le Pan to return the product, Amazon will refund the full price with no hassle. I would recommend that you look else where for a different tablet that has good customer support and stands behind their products, Le Pan is just not such a company.12/7/11 - Updated review;While I still have not had any contact from the manufacture I did in fact find the cause of the problem. It seems that if I remove the SD card prior to the initial boot up it will boot just fine. I performed all the uddates at that time, shut down the device, reinstalled the SD card and rebooted. Everything seems to work fine now. Great little tablet. While it wint replace a higher priced tablet with more memory of faster cpu, for the money it is a great little tablet. Still not crazy about the lack of customer support, however as for the tablet I highly recommend it. I have had it working for 5 days now without a single problem. I have also changed the rating fron 1 to 4 stars. My only complaint would be with the lack of customer support, not the device.12/22/11 - Final updated review;Still no contact from manufacture. Suppose they are very busy. In any case the tablet continues to freeze every 20 - 35 minutes. I have installed the firmware update, tried various memory manager apps and even restored tablet to factory presets. Even with no other apps loaded other than what the tablet came with, it still continues to freeze. This seems to be a known issue on the internet. Some, and I mean \"some\" people have had good luck with this tablet. Most others end up returning it or try to get customer support. I personally would not recommend this tablet to anyone. As for customer support, I have read some say they get good support while others feel support for Le Pan is nonexistent. I can't say one way or the other as I was never able to get customer support to help me.

That was January 27. I received it about 6 hours ago, and so far, I couldn't be more pleased. Immediate impressions:1. It's got some weight to it. It's not heavy, but it weighs enough to let you know it's there. Not like some gadgets that feel like nothing in your hand. It doesn't feel like a toy.2. It feels well made - the screen is perfectly smooth, and the metal on the back is a nice touch. It really seems like a quality tablet.3. It really looks like an iPad, except it doesn't have the home button.4. The Quick Start Guide is a joke.After my initial assessment, I made sure to charge it completely before I started to use it. That seems to be the main difference between those who've had trouble with the tablet, and those who haven't. Once it charged up, I input my WiFi password and it connected right up. The connection's been stable ever since. I haven't yet done a speed test to see the actual throughput of the connection, but it's definitely zippy! I immediately downloaded a few apps (Twitter, Facebook, Firefox, Gmail) and tested each one. All performed flawlessly. Will install Netflix later on to see how streaming video looks and works on it.The screen is gorgeous - bright, vivid colors, and a ton of real estate. Really crisp, if a bit reflective. It reminds me of the iPad screen. Also, it's really responsive - no lag. One note, though - the screen collects fingerprints. Not a problem for me (it's a touchscreen, what else would you expect??), and the included cleaning cloth wipes them away easily.The on screen keyboard is surprisingly easy to get used to, especially if you've got some familiarity with virtual keyboards. The keys, especially when the tablet is in landscape mode, are spaced well and are large enough that accuracy isn't much of an issue.The speakers are much better than expected. I've used plenty of mobile devices, and I've never been impressed with the sound quality or volume. But the Le Pan ii sounds good! I actually had to turn the volume down a bit in the office. It puts out surprisingly good quality sound at a good volume. Once I load some music onto it, I'll put the speakers more thoroughly through their paces.So far, I'm liking the placement of all the buttons and ports. They're all in one location, so you always know where to go. The volume rocker is a bit small and lacking tactile cues (no raised areas or dots on it so you can find it without looking) but I expect with time that I'll get to know its position without any issues. It's a minor thing, not worth lowering my rating.So, as I said, at this point, I'm absolutely happy with the Le Pan ii. Glad I waited for it instead of being impatient and getting something else.

I couldn't be more pleased!  Everything that I've tried simply works!  When I saw this tablet, I was close to purchasing a BB Playbook, but was concerned with the usability of a 7 inch screen.  In my opinion, the LePan is an excellent size. I feel comfortable carrying it around and it's a great size for use when lying in bed or sitting on the couch.This tablet has excellent specs and is plenty zippy when performing everyday tasks. I was careful to give it a full charge before playing with it and I have had none of the performance issues that some have had. I received it on a Tuesday afternoon, loaded up a few essential apps and took it on an overnight trip the following day.  I had no problems connecting both at home and at the hotel.  It was simply a pleasure to use and I appreciated not having to drag around my 14 inch laptop...I've been waiting for a reasonably priced, well performing tablet that was running Honeycomb.  The fact that it will upgrade to ICS in the future is just icing on the cake.  I can't imagine what I could get from a name brand tablet that costs $200.00 more than this little hidden gem.  I don't think LePan will be considered an off brand for very long, provided they can get their products out in a timely fashion.Also been looking around for a case for the tablet.  I liked the price and looks of the Targus Truss, but it just felt big in my hands and I wasn't crazy about the elastic band.

As there aren't many accessory choices for the LePan, I took the tablet into my local Wally World and began trying some cases on for size.  Most of them would not fit properly, primariarly due to the fact that the ports are in different places on the iPad 2 in addition to the fact that the iPad 2 is bit thinner. It came down to the Targus Truss or the Cygnett.  I chose the Cygnett because it was a slimmer, better fit than the Targus Truss. This case allows me to access the charging port, power button and the headphone jack.  I can't get to the volume controls without altering the case, but that is easily solved by using a volume control widget. Some folks might want to be aware that there is no locking closure on this case, although I haven't found this to be a problem. Although a piece of elastic would take care of that problem...  Also, the price was $10.00 less than here on Amazon.I'm very happy with the fit and finish of the case and it looks like it should hold up well while protecting my tablet. Also, the dark muted lavender/purple is a rich beautiful color.

The Le Pan II tablet is a good-to-excellent entry into the Android tablet market.  The size of the tablet makes it convenient to use a number of different covers/cases built for the Ipad.  The Le Pan tab itself has a very quality feel to it and it makes an impression.  Recently, I updated the firmware (see Press Releases on the company website) and the results were as advertised.  The process was straightforward and the update eliminated problems with dropped Internet connections when on the move.  Additionally, the company now sells it power cube via Amazon for those users who, like myself, need 2-3 additional plug-ins.  However, this where the my cautions come into play.First, the promised upgrade to Android Ice Cream Sandwich (4.0) remains just a promise (not a deal-breaker as 3.2 runs nicely).  Second, the promise of a proprietary cable for HDMI output remains just a promise (as you use the tablet this option becomes more desired).  Lastly, and unfortunately, this weekend my tablet died.  It is dead - no response at all to charging cable or the on/off switch.  I just sent an email to the support address to request an RMA #.  Of course I am disappointed but we all know electronic products can fail. So for now I will hope that the company will stand behind its 1-year warranty in a prompt and timely manner.  Timely action is important to me as the tablet has become an important and trusted part of my day-to-day life (email, communications, etc.).  I will update the review as the repair process unravels.18-June-2012 Update:  Thanks to the user community I have my Le Pan back to work (just needed a reset).  Also was alerted to the fact that the Le Pan Shopping site now has a number of accessories for sale including the cable for HDMI.  Even though I did not receive a response from Le Pan Service (RMA request), I still ratethe Le Pan II tablet a 4+ as the company now offers all items that were advertised at the time the Le Pan II was made available for sale.

The scratches across the top were as if it had been repaired or something. I tried out the tablet just to see if it worked.The screen responded well to touch and re-orientation from horizontal to landscape. Connection to wifi was simple.  It worked fine but cosmetically it was NOT the new item I had ordered.  So I called for a replacement. Amazon was great about sending me a return label.Today, March 26, 2012, I received the replacement. YEA! Wait.. nope. I opened the package. The left sidebar is coming away from the screen. These were not shipping damage. Both were well packed with paper padding and airbags. The boxes were not bent of damaged. This is a manufacturing quality assurance issue. This would be a great product if it arrived without the cosmetic defects. It is very frustrating that this was the SECOND one with a cosmetic flaw. I was offered another replacement but I just don't feel like chancing it. I hope others have better luck. The cosmetic issues may seem minor to some but my concern is if I should have to use the warranty.

There is a problem with the fingerprints - I had heard others say it was a fingerprint magnet in the reviews I read, but I thought they were nitpicking. Honestly, it's a problem. You will want a screen cover on this when you take it from the box...the fingerprints are really, really bad.The display is visually striking. The web pages are fast. HD video clear as day. The built in speakers are...meh. Ive heard a lot worse, but we all knew they wouldn't be Bose. The games are smooth. There are a bunch of apps pre-loaded but if you aren't gonna head straight to the app store when you open your new tab, why buy one? I got apps from Android Market, Amazon, and a wifi signal app from a friend. Comixology - the comics and graphic novels look better than print does. Kindle app worked straight-away, like everything else.as for cons...the buttons on the front have a feature where they light up when you press them. But,it would have been better if they either lit always, or lit up when the light sensor kicks in at a certain dimness or something...cause really, I can be laying in the dark reading the kindle before bed, and I can't see the 'back' or 'home' buttons...until after I press one...which doesn't help much; I need to see a button before I press it, not after. (Thats probably my biggest complaint about the whole device, honestly.)There's not an HDMI-out. I don't need one in any way - my home theater system runs from a PC server anyway, so if I did have a file on this and I wanted it on the big screen, I could get it there without an HDMI. And I don't need to use mine for any presentations or anything, but I know some people like and use this feature. So, not a con for me, but maybe for others.I would have preferred a USB port, though I haven't really needed one of those either.And finally, there is a lack of really good cases. It physically fits into most ipad cases, though those cases are not made for this thing. The ports are either covered up, or the buttons on the front are, or the camera & light sensors are. , but it is a gripe I have.

Why? The price. I always thought that 500-600 for a nice tablet was unreal and no way to spend this amount of money for a gadget. BUT, the Le Pan TC970 is really a breakthrough device. It features almost everything that sells the \"nice\" and more expensive tablets in the market today.

Very pleasant to watch movies, browse the internet and play games.- Very sensitive and responsiveness touchscreen. I haven't had any issues with that. Fingerprints? Yes, there are some fingerprints...but, this is a TOUCHscreen, so for me it is normal. Nothing that a regular cleaning does not minimize this \"issue\". The only thing I cold notice on the touchscreen is that it is possible to see the touch elements, depending on the angle you look at the screen and also the ambient light condition. I have seen this on others tablets, so not big deal, at all.- NICE speakers. I got surprised with the volume and clarity of them. There are 2, for instance. How many does the Ipad have?- Front face camera works really good for the purpose it is intended. Video chat, not to take pictures. For nice pictures there are nice digital cameras in the market. 2MP per say.- Great processor speed. I haven't noticed any lag, freezing or delay using the 1Ghz single core processor.The bad:- To be honest, nothing so far. I have seen some people complaining about freezing, but I have not experienced nothing like that. I updated the firmware to the latest version just released in the Le Pan website, which was very smooth and flawless.For what I was expecting to get at this price point, it exceeded my expectations by far, so the 5 stars are very well deserved.

I do not see anything better on the market as far as screens go, I put in on par with the Ipad screen.  Really, it is that good!.As the other reviews state, the touch sensitivity is high, which I like.  Some have complained about it being too sensitive, but I think that is a strength, not a weakness of this tablet.  The sound is fairly good - use headphones/earphone if you want it to sound great.  The size and weight is perfect for me.  Response switching between applications is very good.  I understand it is single core 1Ghz processor, but I have not run into hangs yet. Instead, everything so far is smooth as silk.The makers say that it is Android 2.2 with no upgrade path to 4.0, which may be a deal breaker for some, but not for me.  According to the spec requirements of Android 4.0, this tablet falls within parameter of upgrading to 4.0.  Maybe it is just waiting for someone who knows how to create a Le Pan Android 4.0 upgrade if we root our device - hint, hint...  Regardless, for me, 4.0 would be nice, but all of the functionality and performance I currently need in a tablet is here, Flash 11, fluid videos, easily readable full web sites (not confined to mobile sites for view-ability), games -even 3D types, reading apps galore, 9.7\" screen for a price that is the same or less than other 7\" bigger name companies.The unit appears very solidly made and it is a pleasure to use. I wish I had found this months ago as it would have saved me a lot of wasted time shopping around. So to sum it all up, knowing that this is Froyo 2.2 based and may not have an upgrade path to 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich, if that is ok you, that I would extremely highly recommend this as an excellent tablet for a very good price (I purchased for 199.00).I think I will be enjoying this for a long while.***UPDATE *** CAUTION***I think I am going to return this unit after all.  I enjoy it and feel a little sad over it, but after I wrote this review, it began to lock up/freeze on me and at one point I had to try to reset it 3x before it would reset and reboot.

My impressions are as follows:It connected easily to my Wi-Fi network and two other locations, but based on the connectivity indicator on the tablet, the adapter seems to be weaker than what is found in my laptop or phone. However, this does not seem to affect performance.The OS is intuitive and familiar (I have an EVO 4G) and it is typical of what you would expect of an Android device.  The user manual is located in the pre-installed file explorer if needed.It feels solid in the hands and the chrome accents are attractive.  I read some complaints about the power button, but I have had no issues with it.The screen is a comfortable size (I think 7 inches is too small) and colors are vibrant.  Touch sensitivity is excellent, I have experienced no lags or lock-ups when using the screen.Web browsing is zippy, I am using Dolphin HD and even pages running Flash render pretty quickly.I have used Bluetooth to transfer music and files from my phone and computer to the tablet and all devices were paired easily and connectivity was fine.Speaker sound is not crystal clear when at a high volume, but it is not terrible.I downloaded Mobo Video Player and it works well. I was able to USB transfer movies I had on my computer with no problems (one of the main reasons I wanted a tablet) and they play well, as do YouTube, HBO GO, and Crackle.The screen and body becomes loaded with fingerprints after light use so a case and screen protector is needed.GPS does work, but I experienced some lag even on a clear day.  It always seemed to be a turn behind.I have had to perform a reset, but I am not sure if there was a cause or just a random occurrence.I have been using it for a little over a week and although I have had a couple of issues, they have not been significant enough to not recommend this tablet.  However, if you desire the latest software or are looking for something close to a laptop replacement, this is probably not the one.

I have an Android phone so I figured this would be a fine operating system.  The Le Pan has the real Android market so that is a major plus.  I had trouble connecting the Le Pan to my Wifi and required Tech Support from my Internet company before being able to use the Le Pan where as I do not experience this with my iPod touch device.  I will say that Le Pan provided me with excellent customer service.  They got back to me the same day and called me even though I contacted them via e-mail.  They helped me the best they could and were willing to provide further assistance if the issue had not turned out to be my Internet provider.  I have had the Le Pan only a few days and already it has frozen a few times and the only way I can fix it is by using a bobby pin to reset the tablet.  I find this a little concerning because its only been a few days whereas my iPod software I rarely encounter freezing in years of ownership.  I have also had an issue with some software regarding books not being available because of the Android operating system.

So far I am impressed.  I've had a first generation iPad since it was first released and my cell phone is an iPhone 4.  This tablet performs better (CPU speed and memory) than my iPad which crashes frequently since the last iOS upgrade. Side by side, there is no noticeable difference between the screen size, image quality, brightness, contrast, etc. between the two devices.  It came with Android 4 (Ice Cream Sandwich).  I have not rooted it, side loaded any applications, or tinkered with it in any way.  In the 10 days I have had it, I have charged the battery twice. I use the device 1.5 to 2 hours a day.  I also purchased a 32GB SD Micro memory card bringing the total memory to 40GB.I have some movies in MV4 format that I play on the the iPad.  I copied these to the SD card.  At first a message popped up saying it didn't know how to play the MV4 file.  I changed the extensions to MP4 and they play perfectly.  If you haven't heard of HandBrake, Google it.  It's a nice tool to convert DVDs to files that play on portable devices.I easily configured both my Gmail and corporate Microsoft Exchange mail accounts.All the images I have stored in Picasa Web Albums magically appeared in the photo gallery.I have downloaded dozens of apps from Google Play and/or the Amazon app store.  All run just fine.It found and connected to my wireless router with ease.  It shows a half dozen other wireless routers (my neighbors I assume) which neither my iPhone nor iPad detect.Pros: Has a camera, SD Slot, HDMI output (which I will probably never use), auto brightness adjustment.Cons: Volume button is difficult to find.  Google Play doesn't have as many apps as the Apple App Store and there aren't as many Android apps specific to tablets as there are for iPads.Summary: For ~$250 (including the SD card) I got a great performing tablet with 40GB of storage which is comparable if not better than the 16GB iPad for which I paid $600.

Last December I saw my kids at Christmas and my DIL had an iPad2.  It was nice, but way too pricey for me, however I did like the features it offered and was looking for something similar without the proprietary connections Apple requires.  After much reading and learning, I stumbled upon the Le Pan II.  It seemed to have everything I wanted without the huge cash outlay required by some other manufacturers.I ordered mine March 9th and received it April 2nd.  I've waited to write a review to give myself time to familiarize myself with most of the things that can be done with this tablet.  So far I have used Gmail, Hotmail, YouTube, Twitter, Skype, Facebook, several games (Pirates Of The Caribbean - Master of the Seas, AirAttack, TV and Movie trivia games, etc), Flixster, Regal, Google World and at least two drawing apps plus numerous other miscellaneous apps which are available for free.  I've downloaded apps from getjar, Google Play and the Amazon Android market.  I've changed the wallpaper, created, configured and changed my notification ringtone from a MP3 file.  I've listened to music, radio and police/fire scanners and used the GPS module.  I've formatted and installed two different 32gb microSD cards with no problems and transferred data (music and photos) again with no problems.In other words I think I have tried and tested just about every thing this tablet has to offer.  All with few to no problems (had one small problem with a Hotmail app, but I changed it to an older version and have had no other problems except my lack of tablet experience).  I've connected to 3 different wifi routers (home and two more on the go).I also contacted the Le Pan support site.  Emailed them from their website over a weekend (on a Sunday), received a reply Monday morning.  Request was filled within two days (I ordered an extra USB cable and charger plug).  I received them today (April 17) and they even sent me an extra wrist strap at no extra charge.  No issues with the tablet which required any further support.I got a CaseCrown black tablet case (currently unavailable) as well as a soft-sided sleeve from Disney and the Armorsuit screen protectorArmorSuit MilitaryShield - Le Pan II Screen Protector Shield with Lifetime Replacements. It protects the screen from scratches and minimizes the fingerprints as well as making it easier to wipe them off when they do occur.Tablet feels solid, well-built, sturdy and between many of the reviews and posts here, as well as YouTube, and the Lepanlife forum, plus a friend I made via the review comments if I had a question I found the answer in short order.  A huge thank you to all those who took the time to write lengthy reviews about this tablet and post videos.My tablet came with Baseband v.118 which appears to have solved most of the problems people had in the past.  The only thing I haven't tried yet is Bluetooth because I do not have any Bluetooth accessories to test.  Frankly, the keyboard (while it does take a little getting used to) is adequate for typing.  No, I cannot type as fast on it as I would a full size keyboard, but it's good enough for now.  At some point I may get one with Bluetooth, but for now I couldn't be happier.

I have read many complaints re netflix streaming and here is a word of caution.  If you have N wireless and add any G wireless item to the router the entire network will drop to G speed.  This is true of many of the smart TVs on the market.  dropping to G speeds could cause netflix to buffer excessively.

First off, the experience is different then the iPad,  the iPad has a very, very refined UI, the Honeycomb 3.2.1 that ships with the Le Pan II is good but still needs some refinement if it wants to have the user experience like the Apple. What's the difference?  It doesn't have the fluidity of the iPad-screen orientation, swipes or the near instant response time.  What's in the Le Pan II favor? everything else.  I get to choose where everything goes on the screen, the background all this makes it feel like it's made for me.  Also, I get to browse the web like it was supposed to be browsed.  You can choose between the mobile or full version of webpages.It plays games very well!  The Android storefront is very nice and I think easier then iTunes for searching for stuff to download.  The LePan II is slow on my WiFi, I've been looking in the forms and most of the people on there think it's because of the router one uses at their home.  I use the Cisco-Linksys E2000 Advanced Wireless-N Router at home with WPA2-PSK and AES encryption.  The forms say it likes open or last generation router security features.  I still connect fine, it's just about half the speed of everything else in my home.I also have minor backlight bleeding in the bottom right and left corners- not distracted for about 90% of the time. Only really noticeable on dark backgrounds.  My solution, don't have dark backgrounds!  the IPS display its self is very nice, great colors and wide viewing angles and bright.The Snapdragon dual core proc with Adreno 220 is plenty fast.  I think it's even faster the the Terga2 chips that everything else ships with.  I like the iPad like sceen size and shape a lot, I'm not a fan of the 16:9 form factor.The HP Touchpad cases fit it and are at bargain prices.

My wife loves it and is planning on taking it with her to the hospital when she goes in to have our daughter.**update as of 5-25-2012. still works perfectly after 5 months. A word to the wise, if you are not smart enough to update your firmware just buy the most expensive \"new ipad\" you can find and stop writing reviews displaying your ignorance. **I give the lepan tc970 5 stars because of quality and functionality vs value. First of all, I got this tablet for my wife for christmas so we have had plenty of time to get a very good feel for it. Secondly, between my wife, myself and my 4 year old son this tablet gets used on average about 5 hours a day. It comes pre installed with official android market aka (google play) and adobe flash player(It also upgraded to the newest version through the market). The build quality is excellent, it looks and feels like a brand name device. We use it as a daily driver and I find it to be nicer than my cousins Ipad 1. It is mostly the little things like I HATE typing in stuff. We talk to our phones, we talk to our xbox 360 and we talk to our tablet. Today we were at a family birthday party and While holding my 1 year old I came to the realization that it is very annoying to have to try and type on her ipad with 1 hand like a caveman to do a simple google or youtube search rather than just press the mic button and speak what we want to search for, and THEN the ipads browser brings up what appears to be a \"youtube app\" like on a phone rather than the actual website like our laptop and our lepan do. I Know several people with ipad 1-2,new Ipod touch, hp touchpad and other android tablets so I have had lots of time to play with them all to my hearts content. The physical build quality of the lepan is on par with those tablets. It plays angry birds, netflix, hbo go, crackle, skype video chat(more about that in the cons), facebook, youtube(it plays most of these both in the browser or as an app, except netflix which requires silverlight for in browser playback). The only game I found that it wasn't fast enough to play flawlessly was gta3, which it plays but with hesitation and not perfectly smooth(I have made it to the second part of the city after they reopen the broken bridge). Pretty much it does what you would expect a full fledged tablet to do.CONS ..all of these are well documented and fairly common..REGARDING THE FREEZING EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT....(as well as a couple other things)The few problems the tablet has are obviously related to minor bugs in the firmware which could potentially be fixed with a simple update once it's available from lepan(they have released 3 updates since we have had it so at least they are supporting it).1. It didn't take me long to figure out that(at least in my case) the tablet didn't like us to let it's screen go to sleep ON ITS OWN while it was in the middle of STREAMING OR DOWNLOADING VIA WIFI. It froze once while streaming pandora and once while downloading the extra game content for gta3(both times it froze the exact instant that the screen went to sleep). To remedy this I simply set the screen sleep timer in settings to the highest value(30 min i think) and when we are done using the tablet we put it to sleep manually by pressing the power button. We have not found this to be a hassle because it kind of comes naturally to turn a device off when you are done using it. ........Since we have done this we have had no more problems whatsoever with the tablet freezing........(I did this about 2 months ago)*****edit. we are currently using update build number 4626 and today I tested it according to c.s. instructions in the tablet page discussions and even after turning the screen sleep timer back down I could not get it to freeze again. This morning I asked my wife when the last time was that it froze on her and she said it has never froze while she was using it. It has also never froze on my son, so apparently it only happened to me the couple times when we first got it and I was downloading alot of apps and games and setting everything up. I don't know if it was the 4626 update that permanently fixed it or what but I do know that I have been trying to get it to freeze on purpose and can't get it to do it again.*****2. Skype video chat works perfectly with the skype app that is available on the market BUT the first time you run it the screen will flicker strangely, leave the video call running and toggle the video on and off in between flickers, after doing this a couple times(may take around 30 seconds) it will find the right video settings and work properly. This only needs done the one time(unless you flash a new firmware or do a factory reset) Every time you use skype video after this it will work perfectly as expected. I skyped with both a new Ipod touch and a ipad 2, both worked flawlessly on both ends.3. This is not a big deal but I figured I would mention it anyway. With the stock launcher, the home screens don't auto rotate like they should. It rotates properly in apps and on the web, but not on the home screens. However it works properly when I run \"go launcher ex\" which is free on the market and I figure most people would want to run a fancy custom launcher regardless. (I didn't even notice the rotation issue until later because I had already planned to run go launcher before we even got it.)So that is it, if you can't or don't want to spend more than $200, this is the way to go. There is a reason that the tc970 has such high reviews on every site that sells it. It's because it's an excellent device with a beautiful screen, long battery life, pleasing on the eyes design wise, and does every single thing that you would expect of a tablet.

To be honest the quality of the build is high the manufacture used good quality for a china tab. I am a heavy user of video and internet this tab is basically my PC. My frustration started on the 1st day with the tablet it would constantly freeze not to be confused with a forceclose. I would be using the tablet and it would just freeze constant using multiple different applications. So I contacted the tech support and they where fast in their response. They advised me to update my firmware which I did immediately to version 4431. After the firmware update I am still having issue but now the tablet also freezes when it when it go to sleep mode. Again I place a support ticket the IT support advised me to turn on USB debugging under development and to select an option called leave on while charging. It still freezes to the point I have to press the reset button 3-5 times a day. This is not my 1st tablet and I am not new to Android this tablet is a paper weight. I will not recommend this tablet to anyone, which is sad because this is a great unit and there is no reason it has these issues. I did some research on this tablet and this seems to be a common issue.

This in itself, is a commendable design, unlike the AppleIOS, which frankly goes bonkers if exposed to unknown hardware. The Android platform handles different hardware  makes pretty  splendidly, obviously with some quirks, as anticipated with any open source software platform.Point is, evaluation of android tablets should be distinct, in that, the hardware and software should be compared separately.Hardware  SoftwareSuperb build quality  Gels beautifully with the Le Pan HardwareChiseled shape, sits well on the palm  Impressively fastSlightly heavy for a wrist pivot over long duration  Buggy versions of apps for 2.2(ex-skype)Power button needs getting used to, not complaint-worthy tho  Incompatible with GoogleHangouts(2.3 onwards works)Brilliant touch screen resolution and responsiveness  Secondary memory read/write is faster than expected4.5 stars to Le Pan for the hardware  3.5 stars to Google for Android 2.2 (4.5 for Honeycomb)Synopsis - Le Pan has a winner here.

The Android OS is superior in architecture, and unless you are willing to be hostage to Apple's barricaded eco-system, you are better off with an Android mobile deviceRecommended improvements:1) Newer android version on factory build (Le Pan II has it)2) Changing mic placement to front panel (for better audio feed during video chat)3) Ultra low profile power button, with inward inundation to avoid accidental brush/touch.", "Date": "December 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "I was hesitant but so far so good.", "Author": "KTrain", "ReviewID": "RE0W14GNVCN0Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was hesitant to buy a Le Pan tablet because of it being a brand I've never heard of and it running android 2.2 (froyo).  I was a bit worried about it feeling outdated and about some things I had read that you had to fiddle with it to get Netflix working and about launchers not showing up in the android market for some reason.  Another reason I was hesitant is some of the reviews have indicated bad wifi strength and problems getting/staying connected to their wifi.  Lastly I was worried (and still am a bit) about the reviews stating their tablets had freezing/dying problems.Well so far, NONE of these have been issues with my unit.  I updated using the steps on the Le Pan website (lepantab(dot)com).  I logged into the android market and Amazon Appstore without issue.  I haven't found an app yet that won't run.  Netflix works perfectly. My wifi signal (using WPA2 encryption) is great and stays connected. Running froyo hasn't been an issue for me other than looking a bit dated in the menues/notification bar.  I got ADW launcher running as a home replacement so I could fit more icons on one screen (the default looks kinda goofy with the icons so spread out in my opinion).Most of all, the screen is BEAUTIFUL and very responsive/sensitive.  I have had several people ask how much it costs and get a  surpised look when I tell them I got it for such a low price.  The screen and overall build quality does not look \"budget\" at all.This tablet easily gets a 5/5 so far from me.My only complaints about it so far are 1. the proprietary usb/charging cable.  I hate proprietary connectors and wish this could just have a micro or mini usb port.  2. An upgrade to honeycomb would be nice but I knew about it not getting updated before I ordered mine so I can't complain too much.  So far froyo has been fine.Based on my own experiences, I would definitely recommend this tablet to others.", "Date": "December 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great tablet", "Author": "jstd", "ReviewID": "R3VOOVKGQYZOLQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love the 10\" screen compared to the 7\".

This wasn't going to be for average use, I installed it in my car as a music player, GPS, and on occasion digital gauge display for MPH/fuel economy/engine temp/etc. I have it connected to a generic 2A USB charge that is triggered with the key. I use Tasker to control the system by telling it when to sleep/wake up and when the screen should remain on/off. It is subject to severe hot and cold weather, vibration, and is often left for days (sometimes well over a week) in a sleep state with literally no problems at all. It refuses to die or malfunction in any way whatsoever, even without being reset or turned off for months at a time.The pluses: GPS works great even in bad weather and inside the car. Bluetooth is very stable and connects to my OBDII dongle every time if need be (I have another tablet that handles the gauges 99% of the time, but this serves as a backup). Screen is excellent even in direct sunlight. Even after days on standby the battery never drops below 50%, and quickly charges up even with the screen on full-time and max brightness. Refuses to malfunction or shut-off without my prompting.The negatives: No Android updates from the manufacturer. Limited aftermarket ROMs. No USB hosting (that I'm aware of). The processor is considered dated, and I have run into stuttering audio while trying to run intensive programs in tandem, although I've only had this happen while trying to run Co-Pilot as my navigation. I switched to Sygic and the problem stopped completely. The camera is rough at best, and the built-in speakers are headache inducing at anything but low volume, although these are common problems with any tablet in this price range and of this age.I've used several different tablets in my car (Nook Color running various flavors of CM, MID a81e, Lenovo a2107), and because they've all been on the \"budget\" side of things none of them except for the Le Pan have performed very well.

I used hers a few times and decided that I wanted a tablet too, but did not want to spend another $350 dollars. I started to search for reviews of cheaper tablets and ran across this LePan 2 tablet. Decided to give it a try. I am very pleased. It does everything that her Galaxy Tab does. Just as quickly and flawlessly, I might add. Her and I sat side by side and loaded the same videos and programs at exactly the same time.. There was little to no difference in the speed. Other than small very small differences in picture quality, I find this tablet very comparable to the Galaxy Tab 2. The picture quality is excellent and HD. Just when comparing it to the Galaxy Tab, side by side, The Galaxy picture is a little sharper, but I think I only noticed because I had them side by side with the exact same video playing. It loads youtube, netflix, HBO Go and any other video from any other site that I have tried flawlessly without lag. The battery life is great and the tablet speed is great. This tablet is easily comparable to tablets well out of its price range. I know that many of the reviews on here talk of issues upgrading the software. I did not have this issue, but mine was already upgraded when I purchased it, so I cannot speak of the ease or difficulty of this action, but I would recommend this tablet to anyone. If I had to complain at all, which I am just knit picking by saying this. The power button is a little small and while the sound quality is good, I wish the speakers were on the front like they are on the Galaxy Tab.

This was my 1st tablet. My 17yr old wanted one for Christmas and I thought, 'I am not getting her one without getting myself one'. Like others on here, I researched, read and decided on the one to get. She wanted a 7 inch ( so I purchased another brand for her AGPTek) but I thought I would try this one and see the difference in the 2 and I got me the LePan II.Out of the box, it was nice and it worked. I have 2 jobs and I like having my smartphone or laptop handy to work when necessary. The Lepan II did that... I was comfortable in my purchase. My daughter AGPTek came and it was ok but not as good as my LePan so I got her a Samsung (which is great by the way), bought anohter AGPTek and gave them to my sisters for Christmas.Everything was great until mine (the more expensive of them all) just stopped powering on. I was sick for a few days after Christmas and I just laid in the bed and used no type device to do anything. I didn't purchase a case for the tablet so I kept it in the plastic and in the box ( out of fear). I set up for about 1 week, no use at all. I am getting ready to return to work after the holidays and I wanted to begin checking emails and getting up to date... It would not power on. I thought ' it's dead, put it on the charger'. It sat on the charger for 5 hours, and it never came on. I read the suggestions from LePan on their website and other LePan forums and did all they suggested (hit reset, hit pwr for 30 sec,  reset + pwr, reset+ volume up, reset+ volume dwn, reset+ pwr and volume) nothing worked. I then saw someone that said they returned it to Amazon. So I contacted the seller (marketplace), who even gave me something to do (they said, that is the ICS for you), still nothing. I contacted LePan and I was on hold for over an hour, at work! I sent then an email, filled out the form..I contacted the seler again saying I want a refund.. they told me it was past their 14-15 day policy and that I needed to contact LePan. Well, that policy was not listed, they reference Amazon's policy so Amazon has put in a claim to get me refunded from the seller. The seller and I have gone back and forth as they do not believe that I am telling the truth (first they said, I was past the return point, then they said I probably broke it, then after they received they said it was heavily used and I switched the machine and sent them another one). So on top of this tablet not working, I am being called a crook by the seller.I am still waiting on that refund, but it hasn't been the 5 business days.Nonetheless, I wanted so bad to like this tablet. I loved the size and I love Androids but after less than 10 days of use, the power shouldn't be the issue. Furthermore, there shouldn't be this many people talking about this same issue. The thing just stopped coming on.I am an Amazon shopper. I don't like shopping and I hate large crowds, so sitting at my computer and shopping has been my thing. For the past 2 years, I have gone to the store at most 2 times during the Holidays. This experience, with the machine and especially with the seller had me in tears on Monday. I believe in shopping around and getting the best for the best price but my sanity was challenged with this purchase. It is already fearful purchasing online and especially electronic, but to feel hopeless like I have felt for the past 2 weeks with the seller and this machine will push me away.

Lot cheaper than Nook or Kindle (they are even smaller screen size, with higher price).3. Excellent design. Good engineering quality in the Tablet Model itself.4. Very thin and light. Nice finish.5. Compared to other Tablet (All \"Class C\" Tablets), will give you a competitive quality, with reasonable price. (Unlike I Pad / Samsung, Share Price minded price tag !)6. You can add up to 32 GM Micro SD Card (I did too).Cons:1. Possessor is extreme slow, although it says 1 Ghz.2. Memory is only 256 MB (less than 10 years old Computer). You need I MB atleast.3. Internet access is slow, even if your are have 40 MBPS connection.4. You can watch Netflix, without any problem. CNN, YouTube streamline video works with slow connectivity.5.

Only option to contact, by e-mail, which they with hardly reply back. At least I don't see any of my issue answered.My suggestion, you may first try Le Pan 970 II, at $250.

I have been playing with it for few days now and I have to say, for a price tag of $199, its an amazing tablet. Yes it only comes with Android 2.2 (Froyo), and they don't have any update available for Gingerbread, Honeycomb or ICS 4.0. But for just browsing, watching videos, playing games and using apps like Skype, Facebook and others, its a great tablet. Yes there are few games that cant be installed, because of the high requirements of the game, but I don't care, but if you do care then spend $80 more and get Le Pan II for $279. It has the QUALCOMM 1.2GHz Dual-core Snapdragon processor and more memory. But I have to say my expectation with TC 970 was very low until I got it, I was just amazed at the quality and performance of this tablet. With 1GHz single-core TI Arm Cortex 8 and 512MB memory it performs well. With that said don't try to compare this with iPad2, but it does 75% of what iPad2 can do, and for only $199 compared to $500 its an amazing deal. I do own an iPad2 also. Few small things, the internal built-in flash NAND storage is only 2GB, so buy a $20 32GB micro-sd card and stick it in. It comes with 2GB SD card already, but I think that's small if you want to store pics and movies on it. Yes the tablet does some time gets slow after you have too many applications running, so either kill the task in task manager or reboot. I have only had to do it once since I got it. The big plus this tablet has over other cheap ones is the Google Market app (now Google Play) which is already configured and this tablet is certified for it. You don't have to first root the device and install it like other cheap ones. But I still recommend rooting the device, opens up the tablet for a lot more stuff then whats on GooglePlay (not that its any less stuff there).

I'm not sure why the Le Pan II works well with some routers and not others, but maybe someone can look into it.It's a nice tablet however Le Pan really needs to provide more software support.

So:1. It's not possible to use this tablet without carrying a paper clip along2. Taking into account that this product is on the market for at least one year and this freezing issue is well known to distributors and the manufacturer and a number of fix attempts via firmware updates were released the only conclusion is that this is a hardware problem. Which means that they continue to knowingly sell a product that is defective in essence.Some reviewers are saying that it is Android or tablets' nature to hang. I own a number of Android devices including G1 (the first Android ever) and none of them ever needed a reset. They don't even have a reset button!EDIT (1 week):After some experiments I managed to make this thing work. Or am I just lucky and some wire got crossed inside after a couple of bangs?...With a combination of the free MX Player (from Market, now renamed to Play Store) and the latest 'leaked' firmware [...] this tablet became more or less stable, it didn't freeze for three days now. But still I refuse to understand how come they are selling a device that's guaranteed to freeze very often without applying some hack like efforts. So no more than 2 stars, sorry.ORIGINAL (a couple of days of usage):My aim was to get a tablet for my toddler to watch kids cartoons and play some simple games. My kid (1.7 y.o) tends to throw stuff on the floor when he gets too irritated, alas the price of the purchase had to be minimized. Le Pan was the cheapest one with a full 10 inch screen, so I thought it would be good enough for the purpose.I can say that the screen is really good. View angle is excellent, the screen is very bright.But unfortunately the device is not very usable as it freezes very often for no reason at all. I've connected it to my laptop via USB, uploaded a couple of cartoons. It refused to play most of them, just played the MP4 one.I've installed BS player and it played FLV ones in software mode which sucked - the cartoon video was kind of slow which caused out of sync with audio.When I tried to play toons it would sometime freeze in the middle of it, or refused to play it from the start displaying an alert window on top of a garbage video background which could only be removed by restarting the device with Reset button.And right now it just froze for just no reason.So, anyway, I think that I will be able to convert all of my kids cartoons to some format that this device could tolerate, and will hope that my kid hits it really hard against the wall in the next couple of months which would justify a purchase of a better one.PS: I've tried all of their updated firmwares, both official and 'leaked'.

And of course this tablet is covered with finget prints but when the screen is on they are unnoticeable so its no big deal.So if your thinking of buying this but, are unsure of the performance i say go for it you wont regret it.", "Date": "February 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "TC970 Beyond Expectations", "Author": "Loretta Simmons", "ReviewID": "R6VP4K2JY59DQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased TC970 after pouring over all of the reviews for inexpensive tablets and decided that the Le Pan was the best choice.

I have been to every store in town that has tablets trying various brands while comparing specs.  I finally had to stop myself ans ask what AM I looking for in a tablet?  What will I truly use it for?  When I realized what my uses were, I thought WHY spend a ton of money.  I want a big enough screen to be able to surf the net, get apps from android, read on a bigger screen, watch a movie on a road trip and play games without waiting 5 minutes per screen load.  As you can see, nothing too fancy, just every day normal usage.  This price was perfect.  This tablet has all I want and then some for under $300!!!  I hope Amazon doesn't mind that I got tired of waiting for them to stock these so I ordered mine from Best Buy tonight.  I did have to pay more because of shipping and tax but patience isn't one of my better virtues!  It will be here in 2/7 or 2/8!!The biggest thing that stands out to me as a concern is the 30 pin connector vs. other tablets.  The main reason I didn't go with the Ipad months ago was the lack of an sd card for extra storage.  Yes it has cloud storage BUT that doesn't help if I don't have wifi access.  With an sd card, I always have my files available.I will update when I get my tablet but I am VERY excited about my purchase!!  Now to decide on a case for it......UPDATE (2/7/12):  I have received my tablet.  Let it charge and proceeded to check it out.  I absolutely love this tablet!  I have had no problems with wifi connections, downloads/installs from the market were very quick and seamless, games are flawless, no lag so far etc.  The clarity is amazing.

It takes 20 seconds to turn ON, and another 20 seconds to grab onto WIFI. As a casual user, I don't mind waiting 1 minute for the unit to come up and ready. For business users, this is no good.The unit also freezes sometimes. A few times in the middle of a Appl download. I reset to restart and it continued & finish download. A few times in the middle of just using it. Again, for casual use, no problem. I'm not sure if this is inherently an Android 2.2 issue, or a LePan hardware issue.They should have just made a button for the RESET switch vs the indented style that requires a sharp object to press.

However, I had major issues with it dropping the wi-fi signal in my relatively small house after a few lengthy web browsing sessions.  This became a quite a nuisance.We attempted connecting the tablet to a portable hot-spot via Bluetooth.  Well, the tablet could/would not connect via Bluetooth (though it has Bluetooth capability.) Also, because it has ONLY A PROPRIETARY USB PORT (not standard), we couldn't link the two manually.The tablet doesn't come with any kind of manual that could've possibly explained or helped to resolve some of the issues we were having.

My order arrived promptly and the tablet was already charged enough for me to get to work setting it up and downloading apps immediately!  The display is excellent and it's perfect for mom to see it with or without her reading glasses.My only complaint is that the keyboard case that's depicted with this tablet...does not fit and as the tablet has only a proprietary usb accessory port, the keyboard cannot be connected to it anyhow.  I'm not sure how I missed that little kernel of info during my research.Luckily, I plan to purchase a different kind of tablet for myself, so I'll keep this keyboard/case for that one.All in all, this is a terrific tablet for the price.

I know it's common to see a bit of light leakage but my tablet had significant light leaking from 3 sides.  I obviously never noticed it before since I could hardly do anything without a stable wifi connection but last night i tried watching a movie and it is very distracting especially on a black background.to make things worse there is a 15% restocking fee at online retailer i bought the tablet from.  now i'm stuck on whether to send the tablet in to Le Pan under warranty and likely wait forever to get it back or just get rid of it and deal with the 15% fee. :::::::::::::::::UPDATEFirst of all I really wanted to keep the Le Pan II based on the features you get at a great price.  Like others, I also work in IT and have tested the tablet on numerous Wifi networks and settings.  My main problem is the slow and inconsistent data speeds.  The wifi connection is strong and will stay connected but the data speeds are terrible.  So you can imagine anything from web browsing, youtube, facebook, or anything that requires data is painfully slow.For testing purposes I was lucky enough to have two (2) Le Pan II tablets on hand.  I also tested and compared the Le Pan's with a Nook Color (rooted), Ipad and a HP Touchpad (Rooted, running android).  I basically ran simple speed tests and comparisons on Web Browsing, Streaming Videos, etc.  Unfortunately the Le Pan's almost always came in last.  It would either hang, buffer or keep you waiting and waiting.  Even the Nook Color had a better browsing experience (speed wise).Don't get me wrong, the Le Pan II has alot going for itself especially considering the features at an awesome price.  But what's the point of owning a tablet if you can't get anything done online?As a side note, I've also tried dealing with Le Pan's customer support.  I tried calling numerous times and could never get a \"live\" person.  I tried e-mailing both the customer service and and support e-mails found on their website to no avail.  I've also opened \"tickets\" via their website and am yet to receive a response or reply.I'm pretty sure a simple firmware update can fix the WiFi issues but since customer support is almost non-existant, who knows when?", "Date": "January 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "St. Mark Lion Rock", "ReviewID": "RP7LZNL2C4RRX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great hardware and performance.

I think in the end, why I like it so much is because of the form factor.  9.7 inches is just right for holding in one hand while having easy readability and UI spacing, and it's all without Apple's suffocating user experience.  The biggest advantage over the 7\" form factor?  PDFs.  I go to a lot of conferences with materials in PDF format, and seven inches is not going to cut it.  I move documents and e-books into my Dropbox on any PC and it opens with zero fuss seconds later.  Try that with iOS.  I've had an iPhone, Android phones, and even a terrible XP tablet at work back in the day.  Using this is a pleasure, and you get a lot of bang for your buck.UPDATE 7/30/2012Upgraded to the official Android 4.0.4 release a couple of weeks ago.  Still have access to the Google Play store, and still pleased as punch.  It runs somewhat faster, battery life lasts a LOT longer, and a number of app issues that existed under Honeycomb have been fixed.  A free Swype analogue is too be had with TouchPal Keyboard.  I've been comparing it to the iPad 2s some folks have at work, and wouldn't trade it for a second.  The advantage of DropBox and its local LAN sync plus custom third party apps over the iOS world really cannot be overstated.", "Date": "June 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Value", "Author": "DAC", "ReviewID": "R10V7UVZS9OJQI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The LePanII tablet is a brand I have passed over not knowing it's origins etc, however after seeing a demo on a shopping show I relized it had features others do not.

Save a digital tree - ABSOLUTELY NO MANUAL -PRINTED, NOR PDF, NOR by website. 1. Lose ability to use Google Chrome for Android - restricted by Gmail / Google from using their full features.  (highly recommend Firefox *and* Opera browsers) 2. Have no option to ever upgrade - see manufacturer's email below saying they plan to replace/obsolete this item 3. Experience \"phone errors\" - giving strong indication the Operating System is cloned from a phone 4. If a student of Japanese or other Asian languages, will have have difficulty installing alternate keyboard.  You can change the entire keyboard easily, but to switch to second entry method, more difficult than any competitor I've seen. (Certainly LePan's OEM, having a Chinese website and Japanese name, should be experts at this.) 5A. Gain a reliable email collection / response tool for public WiFi hotspots like Panera, Starbucks, Peet's, Whole Foods, and McDonald's - It is SO VERY PLEASANT to be able to type on a full keyboard instead of the tiny iphone keyboard 5B. Become a WiFi troubleshooting expert: this reviewer could ONLY connect with WEP key - the oldest, and simplest WiFi security / encryption method. It would recognize the more robust AES and TKIP methods but alternately connect/disconnect every 10-15 seconds.

I mean, the fact that you CAN'T buy it on Amazon anymore should put a damper on that, but if you happen to be searching for reviews before buying it from someplace else (like a guy in a van who is also selling meat and stereos) keep in mind that this thing fails on so many levels it's mind-bottling.  (Not mind-boggling, I mean it practically converts your mind into diet cola and bottles it.)One entire side of the screen stopped responding to touch input.  The reset switch (the one accessed through a hole on the back of the thing) stopped working.  It took maybe five tries to get my flash card to get recognized, and occasionally it would stop showing up, making the tablet useless until it decided to start working again.  The battery's connection to the board is awful so it occasionally stops charging and you have to open the thing to reconnect it.  The power button isn't soldered to the main board very well so some owners (such as my lucky self) have had to bust out our soldering irons or reflow tools to fix it.  Le Pan's technical support for the thing was utterly nonexistent even when the thing was the only product they made, and now they appear to have forgotten the thing ever existed at all.

The tablet is running Android 2.2 \"Froyo\" that is the best it will ever do... period.2. Nothing is optimized for a tablet. It thinks it is a large phone with no service. apps are streched out or run in a small window...3. The volume down button broke about 9 months into owning it. (there is a volume slider in the settings so that isn't much of a hassle, however you have to use the volume buttons if you ever need to do a factory reset or upgrading firmware... I cannot do that anymore because i cant press \"down\" to select factory reset.4. For some reason after an extended time, the date/time goes out of sync and web pages and youtube and netflix stop working for \"security certificate validation\".  Again, easily fixable but annoying.5. The speakers are horrendous... Im talking TERRIBLE. and im not some audiophile who nitpicks.

It's pretty decent if that's all you plan to use it for.One thing I don't like about this version is that the battery doesn't seem to last all that long. After six weeks I'm having issues with it not having a consistent charge or sudden fluctuations. Also, if you like Hulu, it is not supported on this version. Youtube works fine if you don't use Chrome (no Flash support so I use Firefox).For the most part, I do like the Le Pan II. It was a replacement after my first tablet (Le Pan S) was damaged.

The screen is very bright and vibrant, its processor is very fast.  Video playback is excellent.  I find myself using this tablet for everything from surfing the web to creation of documents.  Another plus point is that is has Android ICS on it, which in my opinion is way better than the previous versions.  I like the metallic styling, seems more durable than the plastic casings most tablets have.  The touchscreen is very responsive &  quick.  The battery life is excellent, I can use it almost all day with a full charge, this include watching lots of videos.  I don't care too much for the camera on it,  it's lacking, but I dind't buy the tablet because of the camera so it's not a big disadvantage for me.  I was frustrated when I found out the difficulties involved with getting picasa albums to sync with the gallery, but once I got it to sync it's been no problems since.  I really don't know how I got it to sync, but I went into the gallery and saw that my picasa albums were synced.  The keyboard is also nice, its keys well space for my big fingers & paired with the very responsive touch screen make it second nature to type on, to me it feels almost like typing on my desktop keyboard.

I purchased this LePan (in purple though) on 12.14.12 as a Christmas present. I gave it to my wife and after 19 days (from date of purchase 12/14/12) it would not start despite pushing the reset button and start button as recommended. My wife also charged it overnight as well but it still would not start. I sometimes felt it shake when I pressed the power button. I then exchanged it (despite Walmart's 2 week return policy on tablets; the representative was very nice and understood since it was a Christmas gift I could exchange it). I received the tablet around 1.5.13. Now my wife says it does not start again; screen is black, charging it overnight did not solve the problem and doing all the other things previously done did not help. She called Walmart.com and was able to return it after having it for about 1 month. Beware of this product. I did some research online (I took a risk even though some reviews were low but a lot of good reviews were written as well) and this has happened to many others. My wife contacted LePan prior to contacting Walmart.com and they stated that the tablet needed to be shipped at our cost. She even read a review on Amazon and someone returned it 4 times with shipping cost of $18 per time. She was not going to deal with that and called Walmart in hopes of returning and thank goodness they took it back. Yes, this tablet is a 10 inch and really inexpensive; I paid $130 plus tax. You know the old saying, \"You get what you pay for\", this saying shines in this situation. We ended up purchasing a Toshiba Excite and yes it costs $200 more but it got rave reviews and hopefully it will not be like the LePan. We emailed LePan and let them know how horrible their product was. You can take a chance and purchase this product but please know that your are taking a risk.

Dropping from four stars to three, because once you get near the $200 price point, there are probably better options...-----Ok, so a couple of weeks back I picked one of these up for a buck thirty, right here.  A few days later, it listed for a buck fifty!  And now, a buck eighty?!  I mean, yeah, the tablet's actually pretty good (for a second-tier FroYo unit), but with its current price volatility, you might want to consider either other models or other vendors.As for specs, this one is a PDF reader's dream.  Well, ok, a 15\" borderless unit would be perfect, but realistically, this is quite a solid runner-up, and a bargain (at least at its former price).  Yeah, it'll play video games, but remember, it runs FroYo (Android 2.2), so the OS is old, and I have no inclination to try upgrading it.  Frankly, I don't even see a need to root it.  If you just consider it a giant Kindle with the Google Play store installed, you'll be pleased as punch with it.  With the current incarnation of Adobe's PDF reader app, if you set the page-view to \"Continuous,\" there's no need to reflow anything.Other than the occasional freeze or lockup, which frankly happens to all 2nd-tier units at some time or another, the only real issue I've encountered (and I think this may be the issue in some of the negative reviews here) is that you ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO charge the battery fully before using it.  It comes a bit precharged, and the battery life is great (which probably explains the heaviness), but if you let the power run all the way down, the thing won't power up enough to even start a proper recharge cycle for like an hour.  It's a PITA, but the fix is easy--just don't ever let the battery level drop below ~15%.  And speaking of charging, it takes quite a while, and the socket's proprietary, but rumor has it you can use a standard 15-pin iPod charging cable, if you shave off a bit of plastic from the sides.  I've never tried, but honestly, LePan sells replacement cords for so cheap, why bother?Other things:  Remember, it's running FroYo, so NO EQUALIZER.  (Sux if you're an audiophile.)  Also, it'll fit an iPad case just fine, but the I/O holes and button spaces won't line up, so be prepared to use a scissors on the case if you go this way.So in a nutshell, for a buck-thirty, LePan's TC-970 is a great PDF reader.  At its buck-eighty inflated price, though, you might as well check out some 1st-tier tabs that run 4.0+ (Ice Cream Sandwich, Jellybean, etc.).", "Date": "September 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cute but slow", "Author": "Lus", "ReviewID": "R28W2OMQ7TW8Z", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I like everything about it.

Also, after checking the \"allow plugins\" option in FireFox Beta, I no longer have Flash problems either.  Changing the rating to 5*s now.  Hopefully, Le Pan gets more recognition so that there are more accessories out there altho LePanTab.com's store has gotten better.For the price, this tablet cannot be beat.  There are a lot of cheaper tablets out there but this has solid build quality (love the metal accents), sharp responsive screen (not sure if it is Gorilla Glass I have read that it is & some say it isn't), long battery life (over 8 hours) & has all the little extras built in like GPS.It comes with 1 30 pin cord & so far you can only order another thru the company itself.  Altho if you shave down the plastic parts on an Apple cord, it works.The downside of the tablet is that it takes a long time to charge (altho the long battery life negates that).  The buttons are rather small & hard to press on the curved surface but that is to be expected when you want this thing to be thin & light.  The speakers are on the back which can be muffled if laying down or in a case.  It has rebooted itself on me occasionally but the boot time is fairly quick so not that annoying (yet).Flash works just fine when I use the YouTube app but if a video is embedded in a website, it does not work - tried in both the default browser & FireFox.The biggest complaint is the wifi does not always work - altho I suspect it has more to do with the hotspot than the tablet itself (or at least the compatibility of the 2).  In most places, it connects immediately with no problems but when I am at work/school it will not pick up a signal or it will take hours before it does (altho my phone & laptop find it).  If it did this everywhere I would claim it defective but it is only in the same wifi areas so who knows ...This is my 1st Android product so not much to say there but I so far prefer Symbian as it communicates more with you - like letting you see what apps are running & stopping them w/out having to download an app.  Speaking of apps, there are soooo many in the Play Market that it can be overwhelming to pick which one to use.Got the Targus Truss case for the HP TouchPad which fits this perfectly.

Got the LePan II after reading the glowing reviews and have been mostly impressed about how it works.  However, the one site I want to have work, doesn't, namely Seeking Alpha. Going to SA in the Android browser results in a crash  every time.  It freezes in Opera, and loads a blank page in Firefox.  Yet it works on my  Samsung Android phone.  What's the difference?  Samsung vs LePan I can only conclude.  I've had the LePan II for a few days and since we are starting off this badly, I can't just wait for the other sites that don't work either, and god knows what else.  If I get a solution, I'll repost, but for now, I'm not very impressed.Edit 6/30/2012.  I did a recent firmware update and now the browsing works better (in all fairness, trying SA and other sites on public wifi seemed to work just fine, it's something about my network that the LePan doesn't like).  However the battery state, that a few months ago started showing 50% irrespective of charge state, but with the new firmware installed announced that the battery state IC had failed.  I just dealt with it for a few weeks, but the tablet started going into these states that required a reset to get it to start so I contacted LePan support for warrantee service.  They were quick, asking me to to a system reset, then when that didn't work, issuing an RMA immediately.  That was a week ago, and the tablet is with them.

Hoping I couldn't get two lemons, I was anxious to get it because I loved everything about it except for the WiFi issue.  Now that I got the one from Amazon now it still had the WiFi issue, but current reviews displaying a WiFi fix helped for the most part, the speed test results improved, but watching YouTube videos didn't improve so I figured it was just the YouTube app and was gonna keep it.  That was until I tried the GPS and Bluetooth.  I have a Bluetooth keyboard that I got from Amazon that states it works with Android. It paired fine, but only stays connected for a few seconds and disconnects.  The Le Pan 2 I got from Walmart I got to work with the keyboard after a little tinkering, but no such luck yet with this one.  Then the GPS.  The Le Pan 2 from Walmart was able to use the GPS without any other wireless connections.  This one I have now from Amazon only works with some other wireless connection.  I don't get it?

The lack of ports is the only reason I didn't get one of these for myself. There's no USB or microUSB port. There are not many accessories for it. We are having trouble finding a case since most tablets are 10.1\" not 9.7\" and I haven't seen a case made specifically for this tablet.In general, this tablet competes with the big boys. It isn't the lightest or the thinnest, it doesn't have tons of ports and features, but it works and it works well at half the price.

As far as HDMI output, I am not sure how that is accomplished. The supplied cable is the same as the I. There are no instructions in the quick start guide regarding that and no connectors available on the Le Pan site. They say it will do it but I can't confirm that right now.

So far I think it fixes all the little frustrations we have all had with the le pan I. Time will tell.I have had a little more time to play with it and I must say it is awesome.

My new favorite thing is that i can wifi print using  Google cloud print. Download google cloud print to your pc and download the cloud print app from the market its free. Your printer doesnt need to be cloud print ready but it does need to be wifi.The user manual is installed jus press the help icon.

I can hear and see the other person they can hear me but they cant see me and i cant see myself.As far as freezing it will at times especially if you are pressing buttons like crazy you got to give it time to complete the one function before you ask it to do another and some large apps you may install might have an effect on it freezing as well.I think its a great tablet everyone i show it too is now purchasing one. You do need a screen protector and a good case.I have a folio case for 10.1 size tablets by Caselogic and it works great and i can access the function buttons.

The second I picked it up I could tell it was mentioned to last. Its solid like a brick minus the weight. If you used to android then getting used to this is very simple. It has a terrific screen, interface, speakers and feel. I heard that lots of people had problems with the wifi on the previous update but with the v118 update I heard it went away. I don't know if this one came with it or not but I've been on wifi 24/7 and haven't had any problems yet. Another complaint I read about was the buttons on top. Volume is kinda hard to find but once you get the hang of it there's no problem. The power/ lock button is perfectly placed on the top right corner.(held landscape) I am very confident about this because I had 3 and a half months to make sure this was the one.

Bluetooth devices work-not as thin as iPad 3 or Asus Transformer prime, but still quite mobile and doesn't tire arms-not quad core, but more than adequateBegan researching tablets when the Kindle came out and set the new low for price points. Decided I preferred the 10inch form factor.  Wasn't really sure where a tablet fit in my gadget lifestyle, but felt like there was a need for something more mobile and travel friendly. Didn't want to spend a lot because I know I will want a lightweight laptop for more intense tasks.Evaluated and dismissed Xoom and Galaxy.  Really, really like the Asus 300t and the Prime. Just didn't want to invest that much.  Started searching the sub 300 price point and the Le Pan came up with solid reviews on Amazon.  Originally had the 970 briefly but returned because the single core just couldn't handle the streaming media job that was one of my key uses.The Le Pan II fits the bill perfectly for me.  It's very affordable, especially given the power it has.  The dual core on this device makes it quite snappy. The touch screen is extremely responsive. It has been my constant companion for days.  It is very very usable for note taking with Evernote and a Logitech Bluetooth KB, it does Amazon Prime and Netflix without any jerkiness or blocky video.  Basically, it has more than enough processing power to meet my needs. Wireless performs as well as any laptop or iPad in my house.  The speed of the GUI is as fast or faster than the iPad 1. I don't have an iPad 2 or 3 to compare to.The device is HoneyComb out of the box. Rumors of ICS abound and Le Pan has promised the update, but it hasn't surfaced as yet. Not a deal breaker for me, as the Honeycomb interface is quite usable and tablet oriented apps are emerging, so it's not just big goofy phone resolution.One thing I would like to see fixed on it with ICS is the Bluetooth stack.  It could be just the Logitech KB I am using, but I have a connection issue.  Basically, I have to completely reboot the tablet to get it to connect.  When the device times out to save power or I turn the screen off, I can re-connect, but it won't stay connected. I don't have to re-pair, but I have to reboot.  It seems as though the KB is waiting for a response that the tablet only gives the first time they connect after a reboot.  Could be the KB too for that matter. At any rate, works just fine as long as I reboot.  As long as I keep using it periodically, as I do when I take notes at work throughout the day.  It works fine.Battery power is good, not great.  It will last around 8-9 hours using Bluetooth and wireless, but just barely.  It's a good idea to keep your very lightweight Le Pan plug handy.  Yes, it's a 30 pin proprietary job, but it works fine and they do have an HDMI out attachment you can buy.  I don't have much interest in that though.Note about the 9.7 inch form factor.  I have liked the 9.7 size since the iPad. It feels a touch more comfortable to me than the 10.1.  Be advised that widescreen video tends to look better on the 10.1 or even on an iPad since video is often formatted to that device.  That said, I have NO issue watching movies on my Le Pan.  I don't mind letterbox look, MX Player let's me play with how much I fill the screen. Most streaming video uses the screen real estate well, and finally I can format any mobile video to fit the screen perfectly as I see fit. Generally I just format for iPad using Handbrake and it looks great.I use a Logitech Bluetooth KB for Android devices with this tablet. I use the Blurex Leather Folio case made for the Le Pan I and II. I like both.Bottom Line:  Very powerful tablet for a very low price. While I haven't had it long, I think the build quality is excellent and will hold up. If things break down, I will definitely update my review.  I have recommended to several friends.

Javier \"hopelessly addicted to books\"", "ReviewID": "RK4K9DWTCZDE4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I couldn't wait to get home so I could finally try the Le Pan TC 970 tablet in person. After reading the other reviews here on Amazon and on other places online, I was so excited that I skipped dinner and tested the Le Pan immediately. This would have been my first Android device. I already have a desktop PC, a Macbook, iPhone, the Kindles, but I love those widgets on the home screens of Android running devices. Aside from the relatively low price, I also like the size of the Le Pan compared to the other Android tablets, specifically for pdf files. The ability to comfortably read and annotate pdf files is my main purpose for buying a tablet.Anyway, after configuring with my WiFi, I finally got the Le Pan hooked up to my home network. The thing I noticed, though, was that even though I was two feet from my router, the signal strength icon was at the lowest apex level on the Le Pan. The device also kept disconnecting, so I had to wait for the Le Pan to scan and reconnect to my network, which was very slow and super annoying, of course, but I thought maybe it was just my inexperience with the Android system. I went to the Le Pan website using my Macbook, which was in my room, maybe 50 feet away, to download the user's manual to see if I was doing anything wrong.  The signal strength icon on my Macbook was at full strength, even though it's far from the router compared to the Le Pan.  After an hour of connecting/disconnecting, the Le Pan frooze, so I had to get a paper clip to press the reset button.  After resetting, web surfing was still so sluggish.  At this point the battery was almost empty, so I charged it.  While it was charging, it turns out that you could not use the Le Pan.  After reading the manual again, it seems you could NOT use the device during the first charge.  So I went to bed and let it charge overnight, hoping for better performance in the morning.  Again, web surfing was so sluggish!  Also it kept crashing and just totally died - the screen went all black, even though I had laid it down and didn't touch the power button. I thought maybe using apps instead would be easier and faster, but the results were just as bad. I tried logging in to the Facebook and Kindle apps, but got the \"failed\" and \"try again later\" messages over and over. When a website did load successfully, the touch screen was frequently inaccurate - it kept opening the link next to the one I wanted to open.  I could not endure any more torture and had to repack it to return the device as soon as the post office reopens after Thanksgiving. I didn't even bother to see if I could use the Le Pan during the succeeding charges or how my pdf files would look on it.I didn't have any problems with the power button as some of the other users. I thought it was odd, though, that there were already bookmarks on the browser when I didn't bookmark any websites. I do agree that the usb end does NOT insert flush with the power adapter, which was weird and emblematic of the cheapness of this product.", "Date": "November 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Spend the extra money for a better brand", "Author": "DebLW", "ReviewID": "R2FKGBHB5P8B97", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've had this tablet for a year and a half now, and I regret 'cheaping out' every time I pick the thing up.

One piece of advice - do not, whatever you do - let the battery go below 10% because if it does out entirely, you may never get it started again.  The charger adapter is finicky, and once in a while the tablet will just not start up.  At all. You'll have to find a thumbtack, flip the thing over, and stick it in the \"reset\" hole on the back of the machine. And even then, you may have to do it more than once.

About once a week (ever since I got it- 2 years ago), I've had to press the reset button (aka-find a paperclip, back of an earring, a pin, or anything that fits in the tiny reset hole) in order for it to turn on...or, I've had to connect it to the charger for it to turn on.  TODAY, on the two year anniversary of my purchase, the reset button has decided to no longer work and it won't turn on with anything. I've used different chargers, troubleshooted through forums, done everything I can...and when I called them for help, they admitted that there was a hardware problem with this model and that they've been replacing them.  I told them that I've been having issues since I bought it but never sent it in because it was a pretty easy fix.  They pretty much can't do anything because it's been two years and their warranty is for 1 year.  In either case, it doesn't really matter because in all of the forums I've read, people are complaining that the replacements that they were sent are acting up the same way.  In a way, I consider myself lucky because others have had their reset button break much sooner.All in all, if you want to have to be resetting it constantly and eventually end up with a dead tablet, go for it.

I was trying to decide if a Kindle Fire or a Nook would be better for me then I cam across Ernest's review.  I decided to try it out and have been very happy with it.  I have the Kindle and Nook apps downloaded into my Le Pan so this has reinforced my decision to go with the Le Pan II.  I also love that there is an app (free I might add) that is compatible with Microsoft Office (word, pp, excel, etc) which makes it very convenient for me to do school papers when I am not at home.There are so many apps to choose from.  The android technology is very easy to get accustomed to.  I had a set back when trying to download my music, but as long as you use Google Music to sync (can be used with iTunes) and then make sure to mark the music as being accessible offline...all is good.I love that it will accept up to a 32GB memory card which expands the memory capabilities tremendously.  I think the only two things I would add is a camera on the back (in addition to the one on the front) and a USB slot that will accept thumb drives.  I know there is the microSD card slot, but having a thumb drive would make backing up work a little easier when in a rush.I have played Netflix and it is awesomely clear and no lag time.  As long as there is internet available (wifi) the connection and response time are great.  Would also love to see an internet slot meant for mobile internet as well as see Le Pan offer a great monthly internet on the go subscription.  You know, maybe something that is like a wireless air card that could be inserted for anywhere access to internet...maybe the new Le Pan (future) tablets should have two thumb drives...one for memory back up and one for internet access ($10 a month would be awesome...hint, hint).  I would much rather prefer to take and use my Le Pan on the go rather than my laptop computer.I know there will be many tweeks and updates as customers list their likes and don't likes.

It's fantastic and everything that I wanted.  Here's the one problem.  I misplaced my cord for it and since it's a proprietary cord, you have to get it thru LePan.  I started my request by calling on 4/6 and kept getting a recorded message that told me all technicians were busy and to try my call again later...then a hang up.  This went on for a few days.  Finally on 4/12 I speak to a live person that was really not helpful at all and could have cared less either way.  I actually asked him if he thought that was an effiecient way to handle things and he said, \"I don't know, I guess not\".  Finally I write the request ticket on 4/12.  It is now 4/24 and it still hasn't been mailed.  I paid them on 4/17.  The last explaination I recieved was, \"Currently our shipping department is a little backed up. Your order was recently processed and sent to shipping where it awaits shipment. Your patience and cooperation are greatly appreciated.\"  REALLY????? Is there only 2 people in the entire company??????  Moral of the story, you can have a great product but if you don't have the customer service to back it, you won't have customers for long!

But, I'll boil this down...1) It is good for what you pay - great screen, nice looking body, easily handles gmail and simple web browsing... Does well with angry birds and the like... But nothing more video-intensive2) LAG - video playback is a struggle, simply moving around in android has noticeable delay at times - just sliding around using multitouch has a distinct lag compared to my touchpad and direct comparisons of youtube and flash playback were very blocky and disappointing3) Support - several reviewers stated positive comments about le pan support... Le Pan was completely unresponsive to all 5 of my emails with simple questions when I was deciding whether or not to buy and no one was available to answer the phone the 6-7 different times I called over a 3 week period. I am not at all impressed.4) I returned the TC 970, it's just not up to par. The Le Pan II has impressive specs and could potentially perform nearly as well as my touchpad, but the total unresponsiveness of the company would keep me from buying.

Amazon has been FANTASTIC to work with which is why they are ALWAYS my first stop to buy anything online.  I with I could say the same for the folks who  make LePad - The directions say that once I plug my LePad into the USB port on my computer it will show up as a drive. Well, it doesn't and never has. It runs some installation program which LePad just says to accept automatically and the LePad will show up as a drive but that never happens. There isn't a CD/DVD in the LePad box with the drivers and when I go out to the LePad website it takes a long time to find any download and then when you find it, its not the drivers, its a bunch of games and legacy junk in huge zip files that doesn't do squat to help me connect to my computer so I can begin transferring all my music, pdf's, and gigs of stuff over to my LePad so I can use it forever!  I am going to try and call LePad and see if they will take their phone off \"busy signals\" long enough to help me. If they don't help get this beast connected to my pc, I will return it and buy a KINDLE FIRE and be done with it!Friday, August 24 2012 - 07:43 AM - I have my LePan for about 3 days.  First, before you judge this Le Pan too harshly understand that mine was problematic right from the start yet Amazon is in the process of sending me a brand new one. I don't believe the one I originally received was \"new\". I noticed this from the second I opened the box; you just \"know\" this was purchased and used by someone else and returned because of the way the box has been \"repackaged\". First the DVD/CD was not in the box so I was never able to sync the Le Pan with my PC. I tried downloading the drivers yet they were HUGE, in a zip file and did not contain an .exe or startup file. Also when you read the \"fine print\" and \"legal disclaimers\" you are terrified if you proceed forward to sync the Le Pan with your computer. It was my understanding that as soon as I connected my LePan, via USA to my computer, it would show up as a disk named \"LePan\" and \"BINGO\" you are off and xferring file.  Also, this system did not hold a charge while it was playing. Example: plugged in to wall and should be trickle charging while playing and it's actually telling me that it's not even plugged in! Then I turned it completely off to charge and it went from 10% to 17% and automatically turned back on; even after I told it to \"shut down\" and not \"sleep\".  It's possessed I tell you. \"Carolann - don't look into the light\".  I will be reporting back once I receive my new one as I am confident this was a good purchase. You don't constantly get 4+ stars if you a piece of junk.  I remain hopeful.  \"I'll Be Back\".UPDATE: Friday, August 24 2012 - 10:40 PM = Thankfully Amazon is shipping my new La Pan and I am praying to the computer Gods that this one works. This existing unit has been charging for a good 34 hours and is only at 26% so there are additional issues here. Also my NFL APP freezes and no longer runs on this unit so I'm sans football on this unit which is one of main reason I bought it; although it's only preseason.  I'd really like to stay with the Android O/S yet if this new one that is coming isn't flawless, I might have to wait for a tablet PC which just runs the MicroSoft Windows 8.

The upgrade did not resolve the problem so we contacted customer care.  They informed us that the tablet is prone to freezing when the battery life is below 60%, that we should make sure our tablet is fully charged and wait for an upcoming firmware upgrade that would resolve the freezing issue.It has now been over a month since that email exchange and we still have what basically amounts to a $200 paperweight.

I waited about 3 weeks to get it.I'm an Android user the last 28 months.The body of this tablet is really a quality one.The screen just as any other tablet is very nice, colors etc.... The negative on the screen is, the finger prints are very annoying ( my hands were clean )Connection to my router was instant and remained excellent.So many application I like not compatible with this unit or the operating system, (amazon, direct tv, brightness app etc.....Updating the system took about 1 hour 20 min on excellent wifi connection.I tried several browsers I like and I have experience with, none of them works as good as they work very well on my smartphone. Some web sites not coming up at all and most of them has sizing issues and the loading seems very slow to me. Watching videos on websites almost impossible. Even youtube is a very bad stop and go. I tried several browsers and 2 networks with good connection.I copied a movie from my laptop it was playing fine but the sound, what a hell? I had to place the tablet 5 inch to my ear to hear something. Maybe it was designed for headphone users but at this point I did not care anymore.I tried all these things for about 10 hours, 2 different networks, several browsers.All these things works fine on my smartphone.If I want to have a bigger screen than my phone, I will definitely will choose netbook. It is frustration free and works well.", "Date": "January 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "get what you pay for - UPDATE", "Author": "Matt", "ReviewID": "R9D8TKN1Q8CDA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Its cheap for a reason. This is my first android device.First dayLocked up twiceWifi kept not working, even though it said connected, only reboot would fix itPandora and jango skip.. thats when it'd work at allMany games. Like gun bros, dont work (LACK OF RAM, 512meg is just NOT ENOUGH)The touchpad is subpar at best, i find myself mashing the screen constantly to get small buttons to hitI came from an IPhone4, so some of this may be Android's downfall. I didn't like apple until I bought this thing.Its going backUPDATE: 9/17/2011Against my better judgement, I decided to keep the tablet for a bit. I did a factory reset and within minutes it was locking up, slow, apps crashing. Amongst many, many other random problems. Web browsing was a big issue, it would freeze on a regular basis, and forget about hitting the stop button, it just seems to lock up the device. Firefox, Firefox Beta, Opera, and Chrome ALL did this.The thing that REALLY erks me, the RESET button requires a pen to use. I was resetting the tablet a couple times a day so this is just ridiculous.It's really going back this time. I sent in for the refund and buying the Acer Iconia instead. Some of these problems are no doubt part of Android, but with a tablet thats subpar on processor and memory, it makes it unbearable.UPDATE:The Acer Iconia is working out perfectly, no more issues ...", "Date": "August 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Only worth $150 or so", "Author": "Fellow Amazon Fan", "ReviewID": "R21OWLS1EZEXCW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Le Pan TC 970 9.7-Inch Multi-Touch LCD Google Android Tablet PCI ordered this Le Pan and returned the next day.  The outside is nicely built and I like the design.  But I am new to Android and don't know how to verify the processor speed and the RAM memory like people do on Windows.  I suspect that the processor speed and the RAM memory is not what they claim, particularly the RAM.  I feel it is very slow when switching between applications.  I also believe the video card or video chip inside the pad is slow or of poor quality.  It claims that the resolution is 1024X768, but when I play videos of that size, it is slow and the picture is lagging behind the sound, in other words, I hear the sound first and movement of a person's mouth does not match the sound.  I know you will think that the video may not be good quality, or wrong format.  I can tell you I am an expert on converting videos and I can play the same video with no problem on ViewSonic, although I also returned that one for other reasons:)  Also, when I try to fastforward a movie, it will not fastforward, but pause for some time before getting to the place I want it to play, then, the lagging between the picture and the sound is even worse.  That is why I believe the processor and the video chip speed is not there to support 1024X768.  I was willing to pay for this Le Pan basically because I like the size, the processor speed, and the RAM (claimed to be 512MB).  I bought a cheap 7 inch pad in China (350 Chinese Yuan=$55-60USD) with a slower processor and 256MB RAM, but it played the videos much more smoothly than this Le Pan.  In my opinion it is worth $150 maybe even less than that.  I don't want to buy it unless they improve the hardware or reduce the price.  Also, I forgot to mention that on the upper left corner of the screen there is bleeding white edge when the screen is dark during a movie playing.  Sorry, I cannot say lots of good things about this Le Pan.  Maybe I just had bad luck.I do want to say that I like Amazon.  I filed return and they sent me the UPS return label immediately and gave credit back to my credit card even before they received the return.  Maybe it is because I have been a good customer:) I don't have worries ordering at Amazon.", "Date": "November 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Terrible....beware!!!!", "Author": "andrea hilaski", "ReviewID": "R7TVKDSAJ6436", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "By far the worse experience I have had with any consumer product.  I finally received the product only to have it shipped with a dead screen.  Let me put it as simple as possible...What type of company ships electronics with dead screens?  It is probably better that this happened since with the absence of a quality department in the company...who knows what other problems could lurk on such a complex product.  BTW...I tried to contact Le Pan and was told from a recording that the number was busy.03/07 UpdateWell,  in the race to see who is more responsive between Circuit City (the seller via Amazon) or Lepan,  Lepan is winning the race.  They sent me instructions for the return that I am following.  I have not received anything from Circuit City.03/26  UpdateI called LePan this past Friday and it appears that they have received it and are fixing the tablet.  I am a little hesitant though as they have stopped updating the process.  So here I am almost one month and still without a working tablet.04/26  UpdateWell I finally received a tablet.  This was after receiving a notification from Le Pan that I would have to wait in line since they had so many RMA's that they could not possibly tell me when I would receive it.  I finally contacted the Amazon A-Z team(after that update from Lepan).  I am assuming that the A-Z team must have gotten involved, as I was surprised to received the tablet in the mail on Monday of this week.  Now the only issue is that they actually sent me the wrong model and not the tablet II that I had bought and then sent back to them.  It also seems that the Customer Service is more responsive at LePan as they were pretty quick to response that they were sorry for the error and will send me another one and than I can send back this one.  Let's cross my fingersSo in summary....if you feel like dealing with \"Peggy\" who is located in somewhere (that you will never be able to identify) and have time to deal with emails, phones call to which in turn frustrate the hell out of you and a wife that will remind you of \"you get what you pay for\"....well buy one of these.  Or you could just entertain yourself by lighting 3 one hundred bills on fire and watching them burn.  Obviously my confidence with this tablet in at the ground floor level and if I have any more problems with this brand,  I will take it out to the driveway and promptly back over it with my car and then go back to the store to buy something else.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "awsome", "Author": "henry", "ReviewID": "R2BJLIQPIXNH30", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "heard it was preaty good might buy it can it go on skype ovo stuff like that let me know cuz me and my cuzin might be able to vid chat", "Date": "February 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Pretty Darn Buggy", "Author": "Backcut", "ReviewID": "R164ILLV72YN1H", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I am an avid apple user.  I bought the wife an ipad 2 last year.  I have stayed away from anything but apple because of issues like these.  I wanted a tablet to take the place of big binders that I keep music chords/tabs in. I didn't want to pay a lot as this was a luxury for me, not necessity.  I looked at the Le Pan 1 and was pretty much sold until I read that I wouldn't be able to upgrade to the newer Android OS.  I knew that no matter what, it wouldn't be as good as MAC IOS, so I was up sold to the Le Pan 2 so it wouldn't sting as bad.  Im now regretting the purchase away from my beloved brand and the up sale to a inferior product.The tablet is only 2 days old, and it is already showing its issues.  Today the touchscreen wouldn't work for scrolling, only tapping until i did a reboot.  Then again today, I was searching for my home internet when the screen went haywire and was totally unrecognizable for minutes.  I cant wait to see what tomorrow will hold.Also, BEWARE:  If you are planning on using this product with a Mac.  I have searched far and wide for programs to have my mac and the tablet play nice together, it is a long and grueling process that I'm still not sure anything will become of it.  I will update if things get any better for my over priced music notebook.  As of now, I recommend saving your money and buying an ipad.", "Date": "March 2, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004PGMFG2"}}
