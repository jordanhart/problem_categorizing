{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent Tablet!", "Author": "Reannon L. M. \"ReeRun\"", "ReviewID": "REXC8PHU137JQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this tablet as a gift for my grandmother, who was the only one in my family without one. I did some research and I found that this tablet was the most reasonably priced and efficient one for her. She absolutely loves it! It runs smoothly and there's plenty of space on there for her to download games and stream TV shows. It's very much interface friendly so she hasn't had any issues navigating around with it. I would have never guessed this brand would be as reliable as some of the other brands we've used in the family, however I was definitely wrong! I will definitely be adding this to my list of brands to research for future purchases.", "Date": "June 5, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$119.99", "Features": "10 inches Display\nARMv7 Dual Core 1.3 GHz\n8 GB Flash Memory, 1 GB RAM Memory\n5.5-hour battery life, 1.34 pounds", "Name": "Ematic Dual-Core EGD103 10-Inch 8 GB Tablet", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/415501eOzaL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00I9N4J66"}}
