Some have said it's not very bright -- you got to be kidding! At Max brightness it will burn your eyeballs out! What is awesome is that the LOWEST brightness is actually bearable. There ARE people out here who want to preserve their eyes!  Note that the auto-brightness setting tends towards the low side.Battery is life good but falls short of advertised. (see the Engadet review: [...]Performance overall is decent, but less than I expected. Quadrant showed the bottleneck to be I/O and 2D performance which they seem to test by panning an image. PDFs are slow to page-flip and scroll, but the kindle app and web browser fly!There is obviously some inefficiencies there that perhaps Google can help with.Videos are simply perfect - no problem there.The unit does get warm on the lower right side (landscape), but not hot.the poetic case I bought works well with the unit so I don't notice the warmth. Poetic HardBack Protective Case for ACER ICONIA TAB A510 / ACER ICONIA TAB A700 Black With HandStrap with Built-in Folding Cover - Black(Intergrated HandStrap)(Stylus Holder is a Plus) (3 Year Manufacturer Warranty From Poetic)Overall this is a solid, beautiful unit for the price. It will be my new productivity workhorse!UPDATE:After two weeks of owning this device, I have to step up my rating from 4 stars to 5. Forget the 2D benchmark! This is now my most used computing device. Reading pdfs with EzPDF reader is sweet! The high res screen makes text pleasant to read and the moderate brightness at the lowest brightness setting means you can actually read comfortably without eye fatigue.The killer app for me is Irssi ConnectBot with it's text zoom feature (vol. control buttons). Coupled with the Logitech keyboard for Android 3.0+ Logitech Tablet Keyboard for Android 3.0+ (920-003390) (which, BTW, I am using to type this review :) SSH has never been this good!Battery life is reasonable. I turn Bluetooth and WIFI off if I am not using them (which is so easy to do on Android 4.0) and just get my work done. Please note that battery shelf-life is also good. I can leave the unit several days (WIFI and Bluetooth off) without significant drain. This is not the case with my Asus Transformer (not Prime) with it's supposedly 14hr battery life with keyboard. Even with Asus completely off, battery would degrade within a week!I think I also neglected to mention above that 3D performance is right up there in the top where it ought to be. So this device is no slouch! There is some room for optimization for 2D, but it's nothing that slows me down any.If you are looking for a high res device and thinking the only decent option is that \"other\" tablet, think again. The open file system and memory expandability of this device (they provide two USB cables for connecting standard USB devices, a long one and a short one) make it a no-brainer for a user looking for a highly productive device. This is a score!", "Date": "July 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Another hot tablet from Acer", "Author": "Wayne \"Omegafiler\"", "ReviewID": "R3NZJJK6444P4Z", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It looks like Amazon had a limited \"early release\" so I got my A700 on 6/21 and have had quite a bit of time to play with the device and get a solid feel for what I hoped would be my next tablet. Unfortunately it would appear Acer didn't make any changes to resolve the thermal issues. However, I will go ahead and write a new full review anyways as there are some noteworthy differences and new info. If you read my review of the A510, some of this will look familiar.The only changes from the A510 to A700 are the new 1080p display, redesigned AC adapter, and some new Acer software modifications to ICS. Everything else is virtually identical. And as noted before, I am comparing this to several other tablets I've owned in the past, including the Acer Iconia A510, ASUS Transformer TF201, Blackberry Playbook, and Toshiba Excite AT305.PERFORMANCE:Compared to the A510, I immediately noticed a drop in performance. Even when performing basic task such as swiping, looking through apps, and opening programs, it's quite obvious the tablet is working harder to render things on the screen and it's just not quite as fluid as before. Especially while multi-tasking and running processes in the background. I suspect this confirms my original concern that the Tegra3 might have some issues handling the 1080p resolution, which is considerably higher than before.This could be a combination of not enough CPU/RAM/GPU performance and/or OS/Apps not fully optimized to handle the higher resolution. I played a few high-end games, such as ShadowGun, GTA, Siegecraft, Zen Pinball, and Glowball. The games still looks very good, but I can already notice a slightly lower frame rate here. With the exception of Siegecraft, which was way too slow, the rest were still playable. An update to some titles could help, but once again, this could still be a hardware limitation.One of the most disappointing features was how poorly it's handling PDF's. One of the biggest advantages of the 1080p display is actually being able to read in portrait mode. Which I certainly can; the text is very clear and legible. Unfortunately scrolling through the pages is annoyingly slow and choppy.  I tried several apps with the same results; even some that just change the page versus scrolling to the next one.Playing videos, surfing the internet, and other related tasks still run as good as they always have on a Tegra3 device. I performed the usual benchmarks, and as I recall, they were right around where the A510 was.Antutu Benchmark v2.8.2:Total Score: 10,569CPU: 6595GPU: 1185RAM: 2170I/O: 619Quadrant Standard: 3,624CF-Bench v1.2 Overall Score: 11,674This of course isn't all that relevant in real-world use (especially for 1080p content), but worth noting for those interested.OS:Out of the box, ICS 4.04 was already installed (vs. 4.03) which really only adds a few minor behind the scene changes such as smoother screen rotation, overall stability, and improved the camera.  Acer did modify the task menu by adding in some nifty new shortcuts to turn on/off features such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, Notifications, etc. Asus's menu still looks nicer, but it's a welcome addition.As before, the Acer ring is still present, looking circular as ever. It provides shortcuts to access volume, search, settings, browser, gallery, screenshots, and handy preview of favorite websites to visit. I could live without it, but it's nice to see manufactures adding nice touches to an otherwise plain Android experience.The ring even extends to the lock screen to quickly access certain applications. Otherwise that's really about it. If you've played with ICS before, this should all be very familiar.DISPLAY:When I first wrote the review of the A510, I had a pretty big issue with the \"grid effect.\" Some don't notice it, while others such as myself can be quite bothered by it. Beyond that, the screen was perfectly acceptable. I went into quite a detailed explanation of this in the A510 review, so I'll focus on the A700 here. Its only limitation was what affects all other lower resolution displays. Smaller text will look blurry and hard to read.I'm happy to report that the new display resolved all of my previous concerns. The screen is reasonably bright with vivid colors, great viewing angles, nice color balance, and best of all - no grid effect! Unfortunately my screen did have a small amount of light bleed in the bottom right corner. It's nowhere near as bad as the AT305, but it's there. This could be a defect in my unit only, but due to the heat issue, I won't be exchanging it for another one.This display is certainly not IPS as evidence by the fact that it's not exactly super bright. This isn't helped by the auto-brightness setting which likes defaulting to super-dim, although that's easy enough to turn off. Outdoor viewing could still be an issue for some. The display also has a slightly warmer tint than the A510, but nowhere near the yellowish tint of the TF201. I prefer the balance the AT305 had, which was very neutral. It still looks good and does have the advantage of providing a good color temp for movies.One last thing to keep in mind is scaling. Any game or application that doesn't support 1080p will require the tablet to scale to the higher res, or \"stretch\" the image to fill all of the new pixels, which will tend to look slightly blurry or not as \"crisp\" as it should. Some do a better job than others, but this is the same effect you would notice when watching a low-res video or game on a new high-res computer monitor. Tablets are no exception here. Hopefully most developers will update their games.WIRELESS:Wireless performance is excellent. Other than the TF201, which has well known wireless issues, the A700 is right on par with all of the other tablets I've tested. Bluetooth works just as it should, pairing up to my BT headphones without an issue. GPS is also still excellent. I didn't even have to go outside and I already had 12 satellites detected as noted by the GPS Test application.SPEAKERS:There isn't a lot to say about the speakers, but they sound so darn good I felt they deserved their own section. :) There are 2 speakers located at the bottom of the device and they sound fantastic (for a tablet). Compared to the single speaker located on the right/back of the TF201, the A510 blows it away. The AT305 was close, but I still found the A510/700 to have a fuller sound. There are also some Dolby specific settings which add some EQ and sound profiles to play with and make them sound even better.The only concern is how this will work with certain cases that let you use the tablet in \"stand\" mode, as they would be blocked. Hopefully case designers take this into consideration, because it would be a shame to block such nice sounding speakers.Too bad they couldn't put them front facing as they are on the Blackberry Playbook, which also has great speakers. I did notice Samsung is making the change to front facing speakers, so that's a good sign.HARDWARE:The physical build quality is excellent. It has a very solid feel and all the buttons and inputs you'd want. You have your standard front/rear cameras where they normally are. Volume rocker is at the top along with a rotation hold switch. Power is at the left directly above the headphone jack. To the right is the MicroHDMI port. Below this on the right is a flimsy flap covering the MicroSD port and what looks like a dead/blank spot for a SIM card (maybe on a future model). I can already see this flap falling off and/or breaking in the future. Stereo speakers are located on the bottom.Also on the bottom is the MicroUSB port which also doubles as a proprietary power charger for the device. There is also an included MicroUSB -> USB adapter that lets you connect normal USB devices such as keyboards, mice, game controllers, or even a good `ol USB Flash Drive. Unfortunately due to the higher power requirements of tablets, you can't charge it with your PC USB port or your average MicroUSB power adapters that come with smart phones.The AC adapter has been slightly redesigned from the A510. The portion that connects to the bottom port is now much smaller and is angled to the left. Since the USB portion is shorter, there shouldn't be any more issues with folks not inserting all the way.As expected from the spec sheet, the A510 itself is noticeably thicker and heavier than any other tablet I've used. But it's not enough to deter most folks from buying it. In fact, because of its soft-touch backing and added thickness, I found it nicer to hold for extended periods of time. At least until you notice that the right-side of the device is becoming unusually warm.BATTERY:Battery life is one of the biggest issues with any portable electronic device. Fortunately much if it's added weight and thickness is due to the 9800mAh battery. This is easily one of the longest lasting tablets I've used. The higher res screen is supposed to require a bit more power than the A510, although there wasn't a noticeable drop in life with normal usage. I suspect extended 1080p video/gaming would drain a little more.I was still able to use it all day long with various tasks such as playing games, surfing, running benchmarks, and installing applications. I was still at 30% by end of the day and still had a bit more to go. Naturally, your results will certainly vary. But it's safe the say you'll get more life than most other Android tablets.HEAT:This is where we get back to my biggest issue noted with the first two A510's I went through. This is by far the hottest running tablet I've ever used. The first thing I did was bring out my trusty Mastercool Infrared Thermometer and start taking some measurements while performing various tasks. Just surfing the `net causes the right side to get hot enough to make my hand sweat after a few minutes. The hot area is at the right/back side. The left has never gone above 90 degrees.While surfing the web, expect about 106 degrees. This is also coincidentally the same temp I noted while sitting idle and charging. Although for all testing, it was on battery power. Downloading and installing apps pushes it closer to 109 degrees. And the highest temp I saw will be a toasty 113 degrees when gaming it up with these awesome Tegra3 titles.Essentially these are the same exact temps I saw with the A510. This is a big reason I won't be exchanging it for another one and why I'm quite disappointed that Acer didn't bother to address this.Pros:+ Nice 1080p Display.+ Excellent Dolby stereo speakers+ Micro USB Port (and full size USB adapter)+ Solid feel and build quality+ Plenty of easy to use buttons, ergonomic+ Wi-Fi and even GPS work extremely well.+ Improved charging adapter+ Great battery lifeCons:- Quite noticeably heavier and thicker than the current competition.- No Flash for Camera- Way too hot- Sluggish performance- Minor light bleed*CONCLUSION:The two big negatives for me is going to be heat and performance. Both are deal killers for me. Especially the heat issue since this should have been resolved by Acer after seeing all of the negative comments from A510 users. The light-bleed would have also been an automatic exchange, but the other two issues make that rather pointless.Don't get me wrong; I'm not saying this is a \"bad\" tablet. There are a lot of \"Pro's\" to keep in mind.The relatively low price of $450 combined with a nice screen and \"livable\" performance will be all some folks need to see. In particular those who don't mind the heat, which based on some reviews I saw of the A510, there are quite a few. Not to mention we do have to remember this is the 1st 1080p Android tablet to hit the market. Software updates can do wonders when it comes to performance improvements.So where to go from here? I could wait and see if the faster and higher spec'd Asus TF700 can bring everything together in a solid package. If not, I may simply wait for Microsoft to (hopefully) save the day in a few months. :)", "Date": "June 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Pros, Cons, Heat, & a Heat Solution!", "Author": "Andy", "ReviewID": "R3RVBL9PQ25Y8M", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Amazon delivered my A700 last Friday and I've spent many hours since, messing with it. I've install a large number of apps & games to try out. I did not do a full factory reset when I got the A700, as some have recommended elsewhere.Pros: The HD screen is fantastic. I compared it against my gal's iPad 1 and iPad 3, and it is easily comparable to the iPad 3. The iPad 3's resolution is a hair better, but one can only tell if you are looking very closely - for all practical purposes, they are on par. I found that using auto-adjust brightness, left the screen too dim to my tastes. Instead I manually set the screen to approximately 30% brightness, and found that that setting is suitable for everything except outdoor direct sunlight. When I tested outdoors, I kicked up the brightness and found that 80% was the minimum needed to be usable in direct sunlight. Additionally, there is no backlight bleed.As an Android fan, I like to tweak my devices & am a strong believer that Android's 3rd party offerings are one of its strong points. That being said, I've disabled Acer Ring, and installed Chrome & Dolphin to replace the stock browser, Nova Launcher to replace the stock launcher, and QuickPic to replace the gallery. It is also trivial to unlock the bootloader & a rooting method has already been released.The A700 has a very solid heft and feel to it. It does not feel like it is cheaply-built. I like having dual speakers and found that the sound was good. Finally, per the Service Guide, the A700 is very easy to dismantle.Cons: Acer did install some redundant bloatware apps, which I immediately disabled. These include the Amazon App Store, an Acer Photo & Video app, Acer Ring, and a worthless anti-virus app. Thankfully, this is the only con I could come up with except...Heat: This deserves its own section. The A510 had reported heat issues and the A700 definitely shares that as well. Due to the internal design, the CPU/GPU mainboard is on the lower right and when used heavily, can become unbearably hot. In my experience over the weekend, I found that casual use such as browsing, e-mail, & other productivity apps only resulted in the A700 getting warm but not uncomfortable.However, when I play-tested several games - Heavy Gunner, Flick Football, & Cut The Rope, the A700 got HOT. I use a Poetic HardBack Case, which \"insulates\" my hand but inhibits heat dissipation. Additionally, the A700 did crash on me a few times while gaming. I presume that the crashes were due to heat, but am uncertain. After each crash, I'd remove the A700 from the case to feel it back \"naked,\" and it was excessively hot... hot enough that I wouldn't have continued gaming had the tablet been naked. I spent about 1 hour TOTAL, play-testing the above three games and all crashes occurred within that timeframe.After spending time studying the internal photos of the A700 from the Service Guide, I opened up the A700 last night (very easy).  The back panel is lined with a thin copper panel and there are three thermal pads which contact different points on the mainboard.  I theorized that the pads don't have the same \"tight\" contact as a CPU & heatsink normally do, thus the heat transfer was notwhere near as efficient as it could be.  I applied some thermal paste and am pleased to report that that did the trick!  I've posted a detailed write-up with photos on XDA.Summary:  The A700 was a tablet that I *liked* & really wanted to *LOVE* but the heat issue was standing in the way.  Now that my thermal paste mod has mitigated the heat issue, I'm happy to say that this tablet rocks.  A shame that Acer I had to do this myself, but as a technologist, I'm okay with that... but fully realize that the general consumer won't.  Their loss & Acer's loss, since this is otherwise a rock-solid piece of hardware.UPDATE:  After further research, gathering temperature metrics from other A700 owners, and now some temperature metrics from a TF700 owner (in Europe), I can confidently conclude that the A700 definitely runs MUCH hotter than its counter-part.  While my thermal grease trick helped a little, it is still not enough to mitigate heat over a longer period of time.I keep wanting to love this tablet... but I don't think I can... and am finally admitting it.", "Date": "June 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Quality Hi-Resolution Tablet", "Author": "Bill A \"Angus\"", "ReviewID": "R1OK6QRKU1S9GQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My household has several tablets - Asus TF101, Kindle Fire (original model), Samsung Tab 2 7\" & Nexus 7. After using the Nexus 7 for my main tablet I knew I wanted my next 10\" tablet to be 1920 x 1200+ resolution. I was having a hard time deciding between the Acer A700 and the Asus Infinity TF700. The Asus TF700 is an awesome tablet (especially the Super IPS+ display), but there have been many reports of build quality and software problems. The A700 on the other hand has been reported (here and elsewhere) to have issues with heat dissipation. An update to Jelly Bean was recently released by Acer for the A700 and quite a few owners reported that the heat issue was largely resolved. About the time that Jelly Bean was pushed to the A700 it's price dropped to ~ $350. So I took a chance and purchased one.The A700 has largely exceeded my expectations. It's screen is gorgeous, the battery seems to last forever and it feels great in my hands. It's slightly heavier than the TF700, but the extra weight makes it feel solid and well-built. I would suggest to anyone considering buying an A700 to go and find one in a brick-and-mortar store for a hands-on to feel how good the tablet is to handle and/or use before purchase.As far as software goes, the A700 with the Jelly Bean update has only minor modifications by Acer and can be customized like any Android tablet. HD Widgets (an app I strongly recommend) look stellar, especially the Hi-Res pack add-on.For those still concerned about excess heat after Jelly Bean, I used the System Tuner app to check the cpu temperature both before and after the update. CPU temps were ~ 20 - 30 degrees cooler after the JB update. My A700 tablet now gets no hotter than my Nexus 7 now, and definitely runs cooler than my Galaxy Nexus phone when under load. As a side note, I have never experienced any heat-related reboots or crashes, either before or after the JB update.All things considered - price, screen resolution, build quality, cpu speed, battery life - I would recommend the A700 to anyone looking for a well-built Android tablet with a hi-res screen.UPDATE 8/12/13: It's been 10 months since my initial review (above) and this is still a great tablet. It's still more than fast enough for everything I use it for - web browsing, moderate gaming and watching HD movies. The battery still lasts seemingly forever on a full charge. The only two negatives that I would mention are the AC adapter (it's non-standard) and the weight (it's a little on the heavy side). At the current price of $282 here on Amazon though this tablet is an absolute STEAL. I have been looking for a replacement for it the last few months and have found nothing that I thought was a worthy upgrade when taking cost into consideration. Sure, there are better 10.1\" tablets out now but none are worth $400+ compared to just keeping the A700 a while longer IMHO. Maybe the upcoming 2013 Nexus 10 or Infinity Pad will be a big enough upgrade to make me retire the A700...", "Date": "November 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "A700- A great experience", "Author": "Dario", "ReviewID": "R1N3TQY0KJZPC8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just recently received my A700 as a 33rd Bday gift and I must say......this tablet is really in a league of its own. So far I haven't been able to put it down. I've owned an iPad, I've owned previous Android tablets, but this experience has been the best yet for a tablet. I would highly recommend it to anybody looking for a Tablet in this price range.- The HD screen makes web browsing and watching videos on Youtube or HD AVI's look amazing.- The speed and storage seem to be plenty thus far! I have over 10 HD movies and 3000 songs with no lag noticed.- The Dolby speaker system work pretty good too as I've used them to listen to music at the beach.- The battery life is also pretty impressive considering the use I put it through. I seem to never see it below half battery.  * I travel for work and I've gone from SFO to BOS, watched two movies, and plenty of chess with no battery issue.- More and more Android apps seem to be popping up that are fun to discover and continue adding value.- A big feature that I've taken advantage of is the SD card. Once you have one (or if you don't) you will notice the beauty of having the ability to increase local storage space. Future proof.- Google with their OS updates also seem to give me comfort that I'm not using something that will go obsolete soon. I'm always checking the blogs for updates!Bottom line- If you're looking for a tablet does everything you want a tablet to do, and is future proof, this is probably the best bet out.

I had done the same with the A100 and A500 when they were first released.  While those two earlier models didn't really 'grab me', this A700 was quite impressive.First, the display quality is spectacular!  The full HD image is just outstanding.  I used the Zinio magazine app to view one of my favorite photography magazines and the image displays were amazingly clear and crisp. Just fantastic.  The ports and controls on this device provide all the access and control I could ask for.  The volume rocker button has little rubber bumps that allow you to feel the switch and the direction without having to take you eyes off of the screen.  That is a surprisingly handy little feature.  The standard browser worked quickly and smoothly with no objectionable lag.  The unit was easy to hold & light weight.  The battery life was impressive.  My spouse and I made regular use of the device all day on Sunday and still had lots of battery power left at the end of the day.  BTW, the adapter is compact and easily connected to the unit for charging.I've seen comments about the unit getting hot, as well as others saying it does not get hot.  I used it a lot, played videos, games, etc. and never experienced anything uncomfortable.  Warm?  Yes, I could feel the warm spot on the right lower rear, when held in landscape orientation.  My spouse played several games for awhile and informed me that it was NOW hot.  She passed it to me and I felt the rear panel.  It was warm, but not hot.  I asked her if she found this temp. uncomfortable to hold and she said no.  So it was NOT hot.I would give this unit two thumbs up, only because I don't have more thumbs.  I strongly recommend it.UPDATE:  One more thing on the heat issue... There is a very good and detailed review earlier on this site where the reviewer measured 113 degrees F on the hottest spot on the A700.  That's a great piece of info and it is much appreciated.  Now, 113 is a big number and it SOUNDS pretty hot.  But here in the midwest our outside temps were as high as 106 last week.  Now 113 isn't a whole lot warmer than 106. While it makes for a warm day, and we were looking for shade, that temp on the fingers and hand isn't really very hot.  It certainly won't burn or injure anyone and I suspect many, like me, would not even find it uncomfortable.  So 'hot' is a subjective term that means different things to different people.  But 113 is an objective measure and I thank that reviewer for his measurement.", "Date": "July 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good.  Just a couple of issues", "Author": "J. L. Fitch", "ReviewID": "R13KMNQVHGV01I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had the tablet about 5 days now.  I don't do the hardcore games so can't comment about the overheating due to games.I had an A500 so I'm comparing it to a first generation tablet.  It set up easily and ran well, but I had performance issues from the start.  The following tricks solved my problems:1.  Go into Settings: Display: Font Size and set to Normal.2.  Go into Settings: Accessibility: Large Text and make sure it's unchecked.3.  Go into Settings: Ring and turn off that stupid ring thing on the bottom of your screen all the time.These three fixes made the tablet speed up dramatically.  It is much more \"sporty.\"PROS:The screen is great.  I can read text without it hurting after a while.  Even tiny text.  The letters are very crisp and pleasing.Audio is nice through headphones, but the Dolby Mobile sucks.  I turned it off.  I suggest you do too.Video playback is \"phenomenal.\"  I played some HD trailers of movies from Youtube.  No stutters, no wait, nothing but sharp, smooth running video.  VERY NICE!The browser had issues before fixes 1-3.  Now it is fast and responsive.CONS:Audio through the built in speakers is a little better than the A500 but still sucks like every other tablet.It uses a micro-USB port ON THE BOTTOM OF THE TABLET.  You can't use a case in Landscape position while it charges or is connected to a USB device unless you turn the device upside down with your speaker controls on the bottom.  Who thought this one up?  It's not horrible, but after having side mounted everything this is a pretty big annoyance.  The A500 was much better laid out for ports.No regular USB port- Now you have to use a dongle for everything USB.  I had one of those cheap USB sticks that's barely bigger than the port itself.  It worked wonderful for cheaply storing massive quantities of music, etc.  Now you must use SDXC cards.OTHER:Overall, I really like the tablet for everyday things.  I can touch type with a bluetooth keyboard and it feels like a low end laptop.  It will do the job for notes and other minor work stuff without the lumbering mess of a laptop.  Haven't used a mouse yet.  The screen can be seen at almost any angle without color shifting and washing.  There has been some debate about what kind of screen it has, but I don't care- it just works well.  Every USB device I've stuck on it works without issues.HEAT:I've noticed it but haven't really been bothered by it except maybe once.  I had a weird touch screen issue where a quarter of the screen stopped working.  The tablet appeared hot so I just turned it off once and then back on.  That's the only time I have turned off this tablet.  I have a bluerex case and it appears to protect me from heat well.If you're wondering if you should get it- Yes you should.", "Date": "July 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Happy with the a700", "Author": "zealouz33 \"zealouz33\"", "ReviewID": "RXIFL29WWW17I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own both the a700 and the tf700t, having upgraded from two a500's (which I was happy with).  I have owned the a700 since June 16th and used it up until passing it on to my girlfriend last week.  I have owned the tf700t since the 20th of July.  These are my observations:  Both tablets have touch screen issues.  The tf700t seems to have improved after a recent update.  Both displays are beautiful, both have great viewing angles, however the Asus is brighter. I do not play high graphic games on either tablet, that said, the tf700t dissipates heat better (not that I am bothered or worried about the a700's heat).  In the sound department the advantage by far goes to the a700.  Two speakers, Dolby, and slightly better placement wins out.  Both tablets exhibit lag in the browser.  I would give build quality to the a700.  It just feels better to me.  It is slightly heavier but that does not bother me.  I don't use the camera or video on either tablet; on paper the Asus has the advantage.  The Acer has the better battery life.  The Acer also came with the micro to full-size USB adapter, I had to pay $17 for the Asus adapter.  I like that the a700 has a cover for the micro SD, the tf700t does not.  I like that the a700 does not use proprietary ports.  Charge port is of the micro USB variety, the tf700t's charging port is proprietary.Overall, I like the Acer a700 a little bit more than the Asus tf700t.  I have had no major issues with it.

I waited until now to write this review because I just felt that it would not be fair to do a proper review until after the jellybean update. First the pros - the great HD screen do not have lightbleed problems as others have been reporting. The super speakers I happen to think that they are the best I've heard on any tablet that I have tried that includes the iPad and the infinity the build is also quite good on this tablet it really feels well built and well made not delicate at all. The performance of the device is good and exceptable especially after the jellybean update. Its not as smooth as the Asus infinity but its fast enough. I also like the fact that SD card slot is inclosed in its own compartment unlike the Asus tabs where it is exposed to the elements. The raised volume and power buttons are a nice touch as well as the micro- USB charging slot which is much better designed than than the Asus tablets who's charging slot I believe is very problematic. The cons are not many. The only real problem I have with this tablet is the heat problem. The tablet gets very hot sometimes after prolonged use. It has been improved with some updates especially the jellybean. However the heat problem still exist to enough of a degree to put it as a con. The only other real con about the tablet is the thickness and weight. You would think  that Acer could put all the nice things they have done with this device in a thinner lighter case, everyone else seems to be able to. All in all I really like my Acer iconia a700 it may not be the best overall android tablet on the market but I feel that it might very well be the best made and reliable  of all the android tablets. update! upon further use of the iconia after the jellybean update i have found that the heat problem has been fixed! the tablet really does not get any hotter than any other tablets i have owned. so well done acer!", "Date": "November 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "A stealthy Jelly Bean", "Author": "Larry Ainsworth", "ReviewID": "R37Q1W0ETOVLSE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "During the night of 10/18 my a700 was upgraded to 4.1.1.

This tablet was made for JB.  It is faster and the screen touch sensitivity is greatly improved.I did a Netflix comparison with my Acer 500.  I ran the same video on both, side by side.  WOW!  An amazing difference.------------This is my third tablet.  I began with a Viewsonic G-Tab, then went with an Acer 500.  My only experience with Acer tech support was very positive.I love the A700.  I have bought a second one for my wife.  She currently has an Ipad through her job, but wants an A700.I primarily use it for reading ebooks, web surfing, watching  Netflixs, and checking email.  I also read and annotate a lot of PDF documents using ezPDF, and ebooks using Mantano ereader (the best for high lighting and note taking).  Another favorite app is Evernote.  I send notes and quotes from PDFs and ebooks to Evernote to use in writing projects.The clarity of the print on ebooks is amazing.  Watching a Netflix video is stunning.  Almost as good as watching my HD TV.  Sometimes the Netflix video takes a few seconds to become crisp.  But sometimes that also happens on my HD TV.The heat problem others complain about is not an issue.  When I first got the A700, there was definitely a warmth on the right back side of the Tablet.  My wife held the A700 while watching a 40 minute Netflix video and did not mention  the warmth.Because of the proprietary power connector, there are no car adapters or third party power adapters on the market yet.  Because the connecter fits flat and tight, it is not a nuisance like the A500 adapter.While I have not received the Jelly Bean upgrade  (Android 4.1), initial reports from others on various acer forums  suggest dramatic improvements in performance and a decrease in the warmth on the back of the tablet.Yes the Asus tf700 has a more powerful processor, and is thinner and slightly lighter.  But the  price difference, currently  about $150, and  absence of the USB port (unless you buy the additional $150 keyboard doc),  , tipped me toward the A700.  For example, I still use my wired usb trackball for some actions.  Also, last week I had to connect the Acer to my computer via USB to transfer a file that was too big for dropbox.The Asus may beat the A700 on specs, but it looses on price.  For me the A700 is more than adequate.  The performance is very good.  And depending on where you shop, it is as much as $150 less than the Asus Tf700.", "Date": "October 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Tablet !", "Author": "Manu Puri", "ReviewID": "R13A4S3EAZ92ZT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Alright, lets talk the facts about this tablet and dispel some myths around the other tablets while we are at it. I have used iPad and Android tablets and am fairly aware of the strengths and limitations of both ecosystems so the review is going to be Value based instead of hype or other fanboy perception.First off, I had purchased an Asus tf700, used it for a day and returned it promptly due to some basic annoyances (proprietary connector, poor speaker, extremely delicate device, etc) then got the acer a700 and am keeping it. I also played for a couple of hours with the samsung galaxy note and was in a hurry to get away from it. My feedback for all is below - surely there will be disagreements with my assessment so take it or leave it.The Asus TF700 (Infinity)Pros: Gorgeous crisp screen, very lightweight, very thin, great performance and battery life, lots of accessories available.Cons: worst speaker ever on a $450 tablet - specially when this is a media consumption device.. go figure. Charging plug/port proprietary and is very loose compared to the iPad or Samsung Note. If you are going to make a proprietary port, at least make it sturdy enough to sustain day to day usage. The port / connector is so delicate and flimsy, its very easy to bend the wrong way. And bending it the wrong way can pop up the glass and bend the very thin film of aluminium by the charging port - lousy design and execution. I think Asus cut corners here.  The device is very delicate in spite of having a metal body - any small tap on the side will show up as a dent / mark in the metal frame - i personally dont like that. Asus - If you are trying to take the iPad market share, then make it at least as durable as the iPad if not more.Verdict: Great device - just not enough value for moneyThe Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1:Pros: Great speakers, Pen, very comfortable to hold and fairly light.Cons: Slow compared to others for a device with 2 GB Ram, tons of BLOATWARE installed. S Pen software just not ready for primetime. Did I mention the tons of skin/bloatware on the tablet.. Great product if they could get rid of the UI overlay on android.. Also has a proprietary charging port - no good.Verdict: Great tablet made crappy because of the lousy software. Not enough value for moneyAcer A700Pros: Great speakers, Screen, fast, standard ports all the way around, minimum bloatware, Cheap - 349.99 at amazon and Best Buy price matched it !Cons: gets warmDetailed Review for Acer A700 running JellyBean (4.1.1)1. Screen and speakers: The screen is great, very crisp and clear - no issues there. No touch issues after the Jelly Bean update - its fast and very responsive overall. The techies can get the resolution numbers elsewhere. Speakers are very good for the size although the location should have been on the front bezel but not an issue .. just suggested improvement.2. Heat Issues: The tablet does get warm when playing games or such but that was the case with the Asus tf700 also.. not sure why they thought only the Acer was at fault but not the Asus. During normal browsing, there is no evidence of any heat. The Jellybean update did address most of the heat issues so owners - get the new update as soon as it is offerred to get away from the heat issues. Additionally, i believe shutting down the mobile virus scan does make the tablet more responsive and removes any trace of warming during normal usage.3. Software: By and large, the stock version of android is installed with very few Acer specific changes namely the Acer Ring, login screen, notifications/control panel and a few pieces of software (polaris office, documents, etc). A few items like McAffee virus scan mobile could have been omitted but they can be disabled from the Apps menu. Acer included a few bundled apps with the tablet that are ok - nothing as intrusive like the Samsung. Rest of it is standard Android with a couple of tweaks that more or less add nice features to the OS. However, these should come in with an option of uninstalling - still no biggie.4. Standard ports: MicroUSB - my investment in a dozen microusb cables over the last 2-3 years did not go to waste !!. Also, the MicroSD card slot has a cover that snaps in place preventing accidental ejection of the tiny microSD cards. Ive lost 1 card in such a way using it on the Asus recently !. the Asus TF700 did not have the cover on the microSD card port - not good for a $450 tablet which is supposedly \"top of the line\"..5. Size/weight: As the number comparers would tell you, it weighs more than the other tabs and is thicker. Personally, i think the thinner the tablet is, the harder it becomes to hold it when walking around - chance to slip out. The Acer, however has a heft to it which is really nice to hold - specially with the rubberized back and rounded edges.6. Performance: Fast and smooth - specially with Jelly Bean, screens zoomed and swiped smoothly with no lag. Browsing was a little stutterry / jerky on large image heavy pages (that is standard Android - Every Android tablet displays this behavior) Regular pages and most apps worked fine. Since I dont do any gaming (apart from temple run or angry birds), cutting edge is not an issue for me. Email and calendar works great and so do the news, weather, media and browsing apps.Overall, it is a nice tablet with a great price - I love it.", "Date": "December 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "High Resolution Screen", "Author": "pet2tso", "ReviewID": "R3JAYR2R3BENAX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like:*  high resolution screen.  1080p video is brilliant.*  dolby simulated surround sound is very good (comparable to that of Kindle Fire HD).

Received it on June 30 after getting my pre-order.  Installed all my favorite Android apps and even a few new ones.  Was absolutely loving the product----with one exception.  The overheating is a very real issue.  I like the tablet so much (gorgeous display) that I have been putting up with the overheating reboots.  One of the apps I installed is System Tuner (from Google Play).  That app reports the CPU temps.  Mine would consistently be at 185 degrees plus, with the top temp seen (just before an overheat reboot) of 210.6 degrees F.  That's water boiling/egg cooking HOT!So I was putting up with the heat and re-boots because I liked the tablet so much.  However, this morning, it did another overheat reboot, only this time, it did not reboot.  It powered off and back on, and powered up only to the little pretty green Acer logo on bootup, but that's as far as it would go.  Let it sit for 1/2 hour like this, but nothing.  Turn off and back on multiple times but same hang at the Acer logo.  Tried a hard reset (the little reset button hole by the USB power port), but same result every time.So, back it went today.  Fortunately, it died within three weeks of delivery, so still within the Amazon return period.  If this product did not have the overheat issue and had not died, I would have enthusiastically given it a full five star review.  However, for a $449 product (yes, that's what I paid on pre-order), for this to overheat consistently and finally die within three weeks, I have to warn that this is a defective product by its very design.I would highly urge anyone who purchases this to install System Tuner available on Google Play and check the CPU temps carefully.  Your product will not last long when it overheats to the point of reboot consistently.  It will fail shortly just as mine has.Thanks all, sorry Amazon and Acer.  Fix the heat issue and you have a very, very nice product.  Until then, I will stay away.  I did not replace but went with refund, as others have been reporting the same heat issues with this unit and would fully expect the replacement to have the same issue and fail again.Update:  7/30/2012I've seen a couple reviews following mine on here that state the heat is not bad, even citing an outside case temp of 113 F, which I would agree with.  The case only gets rather warm, however...again, I would HIGHLY recommend installing the System Tuner from Google Play and checking your actual internal CPU temperature sensor readings that are built into the Tegra 3 CPU.  As agreed, my case got warm too...not hot, but the internal temps were the issue.  In either case if yours is getting hot or not, the app is free and it won't cost you anything but a little time to know for sure.  Good luck all...again, I agree, an excellent unit if not for the heat.  I've now ordered a new ASUS TF700T so will provide another update in a few weeks to let you know how that compares with the A700.Update 10/25/2012:I said I would post another update on the ASUS TF700T.  It has none of the overheat issues of the Acer A700.  The warmest I have ever seen the CPU temp with the same utility is 105 degrees F.  The display of the ASUS is better, and I now have the latest Android Jellybean OS.  I also bought the dock for the ASUS....very happy now!  Only two pros for the Acer A700 over the ASUS TF700T.  First, the Acer was $50 cheaper.  Second, the speakers on the TF700T are REALLY lame.  The Acer A700 sound was magnitudes better through the speakers.

Here's the kicker, not only is it easily broken, but it's difficult to replace and expensive to do so.  ACER is the only company that makes the particular charger needed (even though many websites, including AMAZON say others are compatible--those only give you that trickle charge) and it costs $20, plus another $10 shipping.  I've seen it on other websites, some with free shipping, but it's going to be a MINIMUM of $20 for this charger that breaks.  I broke my first charger within 2 weeks.

Build quality of the device was very nice, as I've come to expect from Acer.I really wanted to love this tablet, thinking it'd be a worthy upgrade, but ultimately I decided to return it.

There were warnings about the responsiveness of this tablet on the internet review sites, but none of them made much of it (most of the review sites skirt negatives to focus on positives, which does not serve their reader base well but keeps their sponsors happy) so I was not prepared for how truly awful it is.When I first started it up, I got into the setup screens and got my first indications.  \"Man,\" I said to myself, \"That's a beautiful screen!  But it sure doesn't seem to respond too well to screen touches.  As information, I use a Razr Maxx smartphone, an Asus TF200 tab, an iPad2, and a Samsung Galaxy Tab 7 plus.  All of them respond instantly to touch and with excellent sensitivity.  The Acer always needed several taps or a long hold or patience before it ever registered a touch, let alone did anything.I got it all loaded up and put my apps on, thinking maybe it will be better in actual use.  The main objective for this tab was movies on Netflix and reading.  Surely I can put up with a slow response to touch in those, right?  How bad can it be?  Imagine having to wait a second for your page turn touch to be recognized.  Or controls to be recognized in netflix.  Worse yet, since I can't carry two tabs everywhere (that would be stupid and defeating the purpose of a tab) the secondary use of the tab would be note taking and math.  These turned out to be purely impossible.  The extreme lack of response made the keypad nearly unuseable.I also like to have a navigation app on board.  I have Navigon and CoPilot.  They both work flawlessly on every other tablet and the phone, but will not work on the Acer.  They start but will not get past that.  No routing, no maps, nothing.So, the screen is beautiful.  Mechanically it seems solid and is good looking, if a bit thicker than it ought to be.  Functionality is severely damaged by the horrible touch response.  GPS apps mentioned do not function.

I haven't experienced heat output like the ACER in my other two tablets.  From reading/research this seems to be an ACER issue.On top of the heat issue, the HDMI port did not work on my unit.  So back to Amazon it went. Even casual internet browsing causes this thing to get warm/toasty.  I couldn't imagine what it would be like gaming with a case.I also couldn't get Chrome to work on my ACER unit, it would try to load a page then stop, I'd be stuck with a white screen.  Stock browser works fine.In it's place I purchased an ASUS TF300.  Not in the same league when it comes to screen or build/quality, but the little bugger is faster/snappier than the ACER. Combined with Poetic Hardback Case, the TF300 is very solid. Evening of browsing the net, the unit was barely warm to the touch.In short, the ACER doen't feel like the quad core that it is, removing widgets and turning off ACER Ring helped a bit, but is still lagged/stuttered at times when playing with it and browsing the net.

The resolution is beautiful though, another thing is that it lags a little, even on simple things like scrolling through screens. The included apps are very good, and the tablet comes updated to 4.0.4, so no need to update becuase there's none available except for some apps. The heat is more noticeable than the a510 which i had and returned because of the heat. This tab is all great and all, but i think simple tasks like web browsing or whatching a video shouldn't heat up the screen and the back plate to such level. Another mistake Acer made was not to include a LED flash for the back camera, i mean how much could that have possibly added to the production of this tab, like $2 or less, and i'm wild guessing there, i mean, if you didn't want to spend on a higher quality camera, at least put an LED to help the really bad one you put on this tab. Aesthetically i have to say it does look nice, and feels a lil less heavy than the A510, but everything else is the same. This tablet charges a lil faster than the A510 too, it comes with the antivirus app which i disabled since i got the tab, to prevent any heating issues, but nope, that didn't do the trick.Resuming, i believe this is a  nice tablet which looks beautiful and could run a lil smoother, but over all it's good. I think lil details like a cooler screen tone, and the inclusion of one of these two, either an LED flash on the back, or a better camera could have helped a lot in the ratings of this Tablet. Also the speakers are good but not as good or louder as the ones on the A510. The battery is massive, but doesn't last 10 hours or so like they claim, and if you dim the screen and shut off the wifi, the fun is gone, so no point on having a battery that lasts so long if you have to turn essential features off.In comparison, this tablet lacks all little extras the Asus Infinity will have at a $50 price increase, but the Asus Battery is way smaller and it features only one speaker, so it all comes down to personal preference.I haven't decided yet if i should send this Tab back or i should keep it.

I use it to get the news, take notes in staff meetings, get my email, do a limited amount of texting, and watching the occasional video on Netflix, Hulu or YouTube. It is my default music player in my truck.  All without a single glitch.  For a guy like me, the price, the value and performance have far exceeded all expectation.The folx at XDA Developers tell me that it is soon to upgrade to Key Lime Pie (Android 5.0) but I don't really care.

That action actually shutdown the tablet.2) then push the on/off button for 5 seconds to reboot the tablet.Acer support does not even know this procedure.In general, the tablet is well built. I wish the same tablet with a more powerfull cpu. TF700 is not perfect either!!! so accept it when you pay 350, not at regular price.---Update : 2013-02-11Very happy NOT to send my tablet to Acer to be fixed because it's a SOFTWARE problem.I always use stock browser, and i checked \"desktop\" option.

After less than twenty-four hours with the product, I am ready to return it. Here's why:1. The tablet gets super hot while doing basic functions. I could understand if I were watching hours of video or something more taxing, but instead it delights in scorching my hands after a mere five minutes of checking emails.2. It has restarted itself four times. It generally likes to do this at the most inopportune moment; I am trying hard not to take it personally.3. When browsing the web, pages will load, but then there are these accursed white blocks running rampant inexplicably across the screen.4. There is a bizarre lag when reading ebooks. Call me a spoiled hedonist, but I do mind waiting ten seconds for the page to turn.5. On the loudest setting, the speakers are not able to overcome a simple fan. Very tragic, no?6. The permanent bloatware on this thing is unbelievable. Additionally, it includes Wild Tangent, which my old computer used to recognize as spyware in the 90s. What it is doing in this day and age, I do not know. I will give Acer the benefit of the doubt and pray that it is something else/I'm terribly mistaken.If you don't mind blowing your money on a sub par product that is clearly not built to last, by all means, go for it. Personally, I recommend checking out the Nexus 10, or even one of Samsung's Galaxy Note tablets.

The screen is large, the books are clear. Unlike on my 7\" 1024x600 tablet, I do not have to take my glasses off and hold the screen very close (I'm 49 with poor vision) to read the word balloons. I also like the 16:10 aspect ratio, as it is quite close to a comics page; it's a better ratio than an iPad for a single page, not quite as good for a two-page spread.It's also a great ebook reader, with clear text and full access to all the available ebook stores save one.I also agree with those who say that this tablet was made for Android 4.1, Jelly Bean, not the 4.0 it ships with. Jelly Bean both increases performance and reduces heat.Now for the cons:I'm on my second tablet already. My initial order locked up on the fourth update and the touch screen stopped responding. I did not install that update on the current tablet and have no intentions to do so at present.I dislike the charger port placement. I understand the need for the high-output proprietary connector with miro-USB compatibility, but the placement is poor, particularly if you are using the tablet in a folio-style case. My SO has an A100, and the power connector is on the end in one corner, which is a much more practical location.It's a great fit for my needs, and only the nagging question about that one update the placement of the USB connector detract enough from giving it a perfect score.There are better-performing tablets out there, but the overall feature set makes it a great choice for anyone looking for an HD reading tablet, particularly as long as it stays under $400.I had originally planned to buy a Fire HD 8.9\" - but when I found I could get this plus a case for about the same price as a 16GB Fire HD with charger and case, the bigger screen and doubled storage won me over.I'm happy with it.", "Date": "December 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "love it", "Author": "michael", "ReviewID": "R2X6P2XP9Y3IJK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "my acer is great this was my third tablet and by far the best I just wish i could have gotten the next level", "Date": "November 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "its a start!!!......????? ...on hd tablets", "Author": "tech savvy", "ReviewID": "RSCDQTLBS4LCY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Hard to tell yet since there are only a couple of HD tablets. Acer and Asus ..it a little too early to say if HD screens are really the way to go in a tablet..i agree with a lot of other reviews that both the brands mentioned there is a big performance issue due to the extra pixles...screen response  and other querks,, like first generation apps not working  even crashing the device..not enough development of HD apps,, heat issues .  Acer and Asus really need to focus on all those bugs and encorporate them into jelly bean os going through each tablet with  a fine tooth comb working out the kinks. Making each one make use of the quad core and nvidia 12 core gpuI personally think that even though Asus has a much better screen Than Acer ....I think Acer will prevail in The long run  buy the way Acer.. for the price of the a700.

This tablet had a beautiful screen quality but otherwise was horrible.  Even when charging, the whole bottom portion of the tablet front and back heated up to the point of being concerning.  When using more than an hour, the tablet got hot with light to moderate web surfing and reading and eventually would slow down and then freeze and require a restart or a cooling down period.  The only time the tablet seemed to remain cool was in its sleep mode.  This is definitely a poor product and Acer did not show good judgment in releasing a tablet which basically requires a cooling fan.  It really deserves less than one star.  By the way, I also own a Google Nexus 7 which produces no heat whatsoever with use and I tried a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10\" which produced mild heat but had slow web page loading.  I'm not over- blowing the amount of heat produced by this tablet (in fact I was able to feel the warmth through a leather cover that I had leftover from my previous Acer A500).  Just my opinion, but I think it's dangerous to have a tablet that generates screen-side and back-side heat for the entire bottom half of the tablet when reading a web article or watching half a movie.  I'd recommend that most people who want longevity in their electronics pass this one over in spite of the beautiful screen.Also Android 4.1 Jelly Bean supposedly has been released for the Acer A700; however, during the time I had it, it did not automatically update to Jelly Bean, so the tablet I had only ran on Ice Sandwich, so I have no idea of how Jelly Bean would have affected this product's performance.", "Date": "October 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Acer A700 to hot to handle", "Author": "Milton A.

Set-up was a breeze and the tablet seem well built. But, regrettably, looks are very deceiving.This tablet is as bad as some of the of the negative reviews mention. First, it gets incredibly hot and is uncomfortable to hold. In the first few hours of operation I was kicked off the Internet connection a few times. Later, when I placed the tablet in a custom case it apparently over heated to the point that it completely shut down had to reboot to use it again. After 2 days of seer frustration I requested a return to Amazon.
