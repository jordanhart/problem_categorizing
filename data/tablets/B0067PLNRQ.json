{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent laptop-replacement tablet", "Author": "H. Wang", "ReviewID": "RSU0PK7IRFBGU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've extensively used a lot of tablets, due to both longtime interest in mobile technology, and my line of work.  To give you an idea of my frame of reference, I've either owned or used the following tablets:  Ipad 2 (owned), HP Touchpad (owned - 2011 firesale!), Motorola Xoom / Galaxy Tab 10.1, LG G, original Asus Transformer (work).  Heck, I've owned the following Windows Mobile / PocketPC devices from back in the day - HP Jornada, Toshiba e800.  My phone is the iPhone 4.With that said, this is one of the best tech gadget I've ever owned. The unanimous rave industry reviews (and very positive end user reviewers, even taking wifi issues etc. into account) aren't wrong.* BUILD AND FORM FACTOR: evocative of but actually feels higher quality than the Ipad 2 and Macbook Air, which is a minor miracle at this price point.  Beautifully machined aluminum, minimalist but not cold.  The resolution of the screen is the best out of any current tablet, and can be crazily bright enough that it is useable outdoors in sunlight.  It's definitely a fingerprint magnet though.* COLOR - for those deciding between the gray or champagne, I received the champagne, and I actually called to confirm that I received the right one. It's much more silver than gold, it's basically silver aluminum with some gold highlights when the light catches it the right way.  This is *exactly* what I wanted - it's reminiscent of the classic aluminum MacBook Pros, but with a touch of warmth from the gold.  In short - it's not very gold at all.* PROCESSOR - the Tegra 3 quad core processor is noticeably snappy, making the whole experience (even with Honeycomb) feel next gen.  I've been getting great battery life, ~ 10-12 hours of normal mixed used, on balanced setting.  With the dock, you're at 18+ hours.  The NVIDIA fifth \"stealth core\" does its job seamlessly.  It just works.  For a quad core tablet with blazing power, this is again pretty mind-bending and next-gen.  Is a quad core necessary?  Strictly speaking, no.  The Tegra 2 / OMAP / Snapdragon tablets do just fine, for the most part (although the un-overclocked Touchpad is noticeably slow), but every non ipad tablet lagged behind the iPad 2 in terms of real world performance (opening menus, browsing, launching apps).  This isn't because Apple's processor is faster, but rather because if the sheer level of optimization between Apple hardware and software, which is industry-leading. With the Tegra 3 processor, though, this is the first non Apple tablet that both objectively is, and also noticeably feels, faster, more responsive, and more powerful than the iPad 2.  It just brute forces past all of the Apple optimizations.  For me, that is huge, especially if I'm going to be spending over $400 on something. Slowly but surely, more and more apps are optimizing for quad core (especially games), but even without that, I'd get a quad core for the general performance benefits alone, as it translates across every app.* OS / SW - I really like the iOS UI for phones, it's simple yet powerful, but for a tablet it's always just felt incredibly limiting / frustrating / slightly condescending.  I even prefer WebOS to it.  Android Honeycomb is a nice balance between power, customization and being relatively easy to pick up, just perfect for the tablet form factor.  My 2 year old toddler figured out how to use it in about 20 seconds (similar to WebOS and iOS).  That being said, I'm looking forward to ICS, which should make things even more stable (HC still crashes occasionally)and uniform. The fact that the Prime gets an ICS in a month or two is fantastic. The pre-loaded Asus apps are relatively minimal and unobtrusive, and some actually are quite nice, such as the Asus cloud.  Polaris Office is solid.  The Android Market could be improved though, especially in terms of sorting and organization.  Finding the right app can be a bit of a crapshoot.CONS: Basically the same nits as others have pointed out.* SPEAKER:  the rear-facing speaker placement is a bit dumb, because it gets covered up relatively easily by your hands or when you set it down.  However, you can still hear it even if it's completely covered, it's pretty loud, and it's located where the tablet tapers inwards so it doesn't get completely covered by a flat surface when setting it down.  I don't mind the lack of a second speaker per se, as you hardly get stereo sound from any of the other tablets that have two speakers.  I would say the sound quality of the Prime is on par with any other tablet, but it is just a bit easier to muffle.  A jawbone jambox bluetooth speaker or the like works beautifully to supplement this tablet.  It's certainly not needed, but it's a nice addition.* CHARGER - the proprietary charger really annoys me.  Until Asus comes out with more accessories, I'm basically stuck with using my one charging cord.  Even charging via the dock requires the proprietary connector.  It's not worth deducting a star for (at least for me), because it's more of an annoyance in light of how great the rest of the device is, but sheesh.* PRODUCT LAUNCH - for a $21 billion company of 110,000+ employees, Asus still can't do a good product launch to save its life.  This doesn't detract from the end product per se, but it's worth mentioning because so many pre-orders (on Amazon and elsewhere) were bungled or delayed.  Asus is starting to consistently put out really great products, but in order to get to the \"next level\"(Sony, Apple etc.) in the eyes of the average consumer, they're going to really need to work on marketing and sales execution.OVERALL: this thing is pretty ingenious, especially with the accessory dock / keyboard.  Hopefully a harbinger of good things to come in the Android tablet space.<<UPDATES AS OF 1/24/2012>>These are discussed more in the comments, but I thought it would be useful to update the main review.* ICS - I updated to ICS the first day it was out (good job Asus in pushing this out two days earlier), to absolutely no problems.  It was like any other firmware update.  The system notifies you that there's an update available, you tap yes, and voila.  ~10 minutes later, ICS is installed.  It's pretty seamless - no loss of applications or data.  I haven't noticed wholesale differences, but everything is smoother, more streamlined, and sometimes faster.  It's a definite plus.  Asus has already provided multiple firmware updates (on top of ICS), which is a very good sign that this product is being actively supported.* WiFi - it's been pretty definitively proven that an all-aluminum back-plate is not the best for enhancing WiFI signals.  Asus attempted to make up for this via \"antenna differentiation,\" a fancy way for saying that there are two antennas instead of one.  In practice, mine has very good wifi reception up to about 25-30 feet from the router.  Specific numbers: wifi analyzer average value of -50 to -60, and speedtest of up to 18mbps, exactly on par with my laptop.  However, once you get really far away from the router (i.e. outside, or more than 75 feet from the router), the performance erodes at a higher rate than the comparison laptop (wifi analyzer -90).  For my purposes, this is extremely useable, and I never noticed the supposedly weak wifi until I started doing actual tests out of curiosity. A lot of people have had luck with installing repeaters and / or more powerful routers, but I haven't needed to go that route.  Asus has announced that they're making a new Transformer Prime variant, the 700T, due in a few months (supposedly).  This one will have a different, non-metallic backplate, similar to the original Transformer (i.e. plastic).  For me, I'm happy to sacrifice a slight amount of WiFi range for the distinctive spun-aluminum backplate; those who don't feel this way should perhaps wait for the 700T if they can.* Dock - my champagne dock finally shipped yesterday, about a month after the actual tablet arrived.  I can understand this somewhat if this device were sold out by the millions, but I don't think that that's the case (even though it looks like this tablet is, deservedly, a hit as far as Android tabs go).  It's just an almost mind-bogglingly bad manufacturing / supply issue with Asus.  It's like they make 10 at a time and call it a day.  Hopefully it's just the first month hiccup - it looks like there are more docks (esp. the grey) among different retailers and that's a good sign.  My original criticism stands though - Asus is insanely bad at product launches.* Accessories - I ended up purchasing this MoKo(TM) Premium Quality Slim-Fit Folio Cover Case with built-in Multi-Angle Stand for Asus Eee Pad Transformer Prime TF201 10.1-Inch Android Tablet, and the Skinomi Techskin screen protector.  The case is not as whiz-bang as some iPad cases - it's the same tired black pseudo leather, but it's cheap and it gets the job done in terms of functionality.  The skin is ok but seems to, ironically, scratch easily.  I've had better luck with Invisibleshield with past devices.* Overall - I'm pleased to report that the tablet is still working great.  After a month of use, I'd say what really sets it apart is the Tegra 3 quad core, which is an unadulterated good.  I can't imagine using a tablet without one now.  The form factor and build are great, but with the caveats noted above.", "Date": "December 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Asus Transformer Prime - IPAD killr ?", "Author": "R. Richelson \"solar guy\"", "ReviewID": "RQ5DE78UTK60W", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Hi guys,Figured I'd stop by since this is the hot toy for the Christmas season !I purchased the 32GB champagne color. I havent put T201 thru its paces yet butdid perform some testing.Quality =Fit and finish is 100%, Very solid feel.Size =Very thin, kinda difficult to hold in hand, I'd recommend purchasing a gel caseor something similar.Gaming =Played the pre-install games and they both ran with 0 stutters and wereextremely fluid. did i purchase a a multipurpose tablet or a gaming tablet... i think the latter :)Performance =Tablet was completely fluid when changing from one screen to the next, i especially like the multi windowtab on the bottom left, it will allow you to select anything previously opened (and will allow you to close too)Built in music player seemed basic and didnt appear to have the ability to download album art. I'll stick withamazon cloud mp3 player.Web =(subjet to further testing) web browsing seemed to be alittle slow, this was experienced with java enabled... with disabled performance was snappy and goodYouTube & amazon streaming =using the youtube app , it was a beautiful display and worked flawlessly. Amazon needs to make an app to stream their prime videos instead of going thru the web... however once a few buttons are pressed the video does fill the entire screen and works. Please note imbedded youtube in web DID NOT display any stutter or frame drops.Sound =Unfortunately this is what caused me to give 4 instead of 5 stars. The audio is quite loud and clearhowever only being emitted from a single speaker port does not provide the spartial/stereo sound. perhapsblue tooth or headset will eliminate this concern.Camera =Front facing 1.2MP camera provided acceptable image quality, however white balance should be adjusted to fully ensure quality (dont use automatic) , rear facing camera provided a good quality picture with decent focus and brightness... even in poor lighting conditions however any zoom used the image would be blurry depending upon x2 x3 etc. video mode was tested with low movement and provided a better quality then my nikon p500 (p500 seems to be abit jumpy).Battery life =Unable to report at this time since testing was limited to less then a full charge.Display =Was very colorful and bright, 600 nits of brightness will make it useable outside. normal amount of backlight bleeding (almost none but there's always some). backlight bleed test was performed and two hot spots were identified one on bottom and other on right side. As mentioned previously the amount of light imo is quite minimal and i've seen far worse on other items. one of my apps displayed a completely white page and there was two hot spots (white slightly brigter then the rest of the page) this may be a fluke or not... i was able to duplicate the brighter pixel, its barely noticeable however is visable on default screen in other colors... not a deal breaker its about the size of a pin head with a slight glow around it, clarification you wouldnt know its there unless i told you to look for it.WIFI Range =two apps were used to test the wifi range speedtest (same test server) and wifi analyzer. I've only compared the two and not a laptop.. plus my house has about 800watts of electronic interference :)12 feet away from base stationevo3d = 15.38 down 4.86 up signal str = -46 dbmprime = 20.50 down 5.00 up signal str = -43 dbmtwo walls, outside, about 85 feet awayevo3d = 02.26 down 0.89 up signal str = -88 dbmprime = 05.50 down 3.00 up signal str = -75 dbmGPS =Best reception i got was 5/9 stable 4/8.UPDATE: Reports have been surfacing GPS isnt working or isnt working properly... When I performed the test it did find 4/8 and continued to have the searching graphic. Honestly I dont know what is normal for GPS reception with this device. Will compare against phone later.Operation & bugs =With any new device there will be patches and bug fixes, I dont assume any different with the prime.while transferring pictures via usb , i was viewing the pictures and multiple times it froze and displayederror resulting in restart of picture viewer. Another item was installation of a large gamesoft game dungeonrunners 2, I had music playing in the background and every 15 seconds or so the music would stutter for a second or twoand then continue playing. I'm sure this will be addressed with ICE and the use of 4/5 cores properly.I'll update this review as time allowsIf you guys want specific info or test , please feel free to ask !01/09/12GPS has issues... perhaps big onces since Asus removed GPS from spec sheet. it appears the metal backing is a hinderance for the gps signal.Latest asus update has improved web speed w/java enabled. I prevously tested wireless and it provided a good speed outside the house. but a few rooms across in my house and the speed dropped extremely low, after update its doubled @ same location.01/19/12reduced another point due to asus removing GPS from their sales web site, Additionally Asus should offer a replacement backplate to elminate the gps and wifi issues. Please note ICS has made the web browsing experience lightning fast - im very impressed. I'm seriously concerned about the future of the prime , the handling of the signal issues , and amazon removing it from sale. I'm returning this to amazon till the smoke clears.", "Date": "December 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best. Tablet. Period.", "Author": "Jeremy", "ReviewID": "R2AQ47SD5529Q3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a review for the 64gb Amethyst Gray model. (1/17/12) I have now had my dock for over a week, so I will update a few sections of this review with my impressions of the dock and tablet combined.First, I'd like to take a brief moment to discuss the launch of this tablet. Asus announced it to much hype and the initial reviews only compounded that hype. I preordered it on specs alone back in November. The initial reviews were all glowing with very few negatives. Then the initial units went out and there appeared to be widespread disappointment. I am happy to say that my experience closely mirrors that of the initial professional reviewers.Build QualityThis is by far the best looking tablet I've seen. I was worried about it being too purple, but I think the color is perfect. I love the aluminum body and how thin it is. It is very thin and light which makes it easy to hold an use for a long time. I really love the way it looks and feels. It's a fingerprint magnet, but I guess you'll have that when you're touching all over it constantly. Asus provides a microfiber cloth with the device that works very well at keeping it clean.Battery LifeThe battery life has exceeded my expectations. I can get 8-9 hours of constant use, browsing web pages, playing games, watching videos, all with wifi on and screen and normal brightness. When not in use, the battery hardly drains at all. There is no reason to power down even if you aren't going to use it for a couple days, you might lose like 5-8% battery during that whole time. (1/17/12) The dock does a great job extending the battery life. I can easily get 14-15 hours of use when they are together.Processor (Gaming)The Asus Transformer Prime uses the Tegra 3 processor. This makes the tablet very fast. Running games like Glowball and Shadowgun look fantastic. There is no slowdown to be seen. Switching between apps is also very quick. I've been very happy with the performance of this device, and I expect, going forward, that this quad-core processor will be able to keep up with the quickly evolving tablet landscape. It should be fairly \"future-proof\". Using HDMI-out and a wireless controller, you can play these amazing games on your big-screen tv, making this a type of videogame console. Using SNESoid, N64oid, and other emulators with the wireless controller turn this into a retro gaming powerhouse. (1/17/12) I have been able to get my PS3 controller to connect wirelessly to the Prime. Playing games on the TV is perfect with this.ScreenIt's great. The difference brightness settings make it a joy to look at no matter the lighting conditions. Videos and games look great on it. The touch response is perfect and it's very easy to operate. (1/5/12) I am able to confirm that there is slightly noticeable light bleed in the upper right part of the screen. It's very feint and can only be seen with certain black screens, and only if I'm specifically looking for it.GPSI must take a moment to discuss the GPS issues. So far, I have not been able to lock on any satellites. This does not lower my review score because I never intended to use the GPS on a Wifi only device. My cell phone with 3g/4g data and 4.5\" screen is a much better navigator. If using a 10\" screen to navigate is a priority for you, you should probably look elsewhere. This simply won't get the job done. The tablet is still easily able to tell your location using Wifi, so all location-based services function without issue.WifiThere were reports of bad wifi on the tablet. In my everyday use, it has been more than adequate. It quickly connects, and I have been able to download apps and browse webpages quickly. It's signal strength is on par with my Galaxy Nexus smartphone. My room is 2 floors below the router, and I still get full bars.CameraThe rear camera is great, but I don't expect to get much use out of it. It's difficult to take pictures using such a large device. I'm happy they included a front-facing camera though, it works great with the Skype and Google Messenger apps.SoundThe rear speaker is decent enough for notifications and a quick video, but I'd recommend using headphones in most cases. It's loud enough, but still has a small speaker sound, and I get much better audio out of my headphones. I'd say the speaker is better than other tablet speakers I've heard, but I'd still use an external speaker or headphones if you need better quality.ExpandabilityI want to touch on the expandability on this tablet versus the competition. At this time, I can only comment on the tablet itself, which has a micro-sd port. I had read complaints that the micro-sd sticks out too far, but it doesn't create a problem for me. I can still hold the tablet by it's sides without problem. It won't pop out automatically or anything. The keyboard dock will add a full-size sd card slot as well as a full-size USB port which will accept USB hubs. As tablets are primarily media consumption devices, this expandability is important to me so that I can take many high-quality movies, tv shows, and music with me on-the-go. No other tablets come close to this capacity.Android OSRunning Android versus iOS was a requirement for me. I'm a gadget lover and love the ability to customize. With Android, if you don't like the stock keyboard, you can replace it, which I did, with Swiftkey. Swiftkey allows you to use a \"split\" keyboard, so if you hold the tablet in your hands, it's very easy to type with, and makes the tablet experience much better. This level of customization is found throughout Android. The task switcher makes it easy to go from app to app. I honestly love the stock browser. If you turn on the quick controls from the advanced settings, you can switch between bookmarks, tabs, forward, back, etc with just the swipe of a finger. Pages seemed to load quickly. (1/17/12) With ICS and the keyboard dock, the Transformer Prime really starts to shine. I never thought using a mouse and keyboard would be so great and intuitive with Android. I really love it, it's like they were made for each other.ConclusionI have wanted a tablet for a while, since the iPad took off, and this was the first tablet that seemed good enough to take the plunge. I'm glad I waited because this meets my every expectation. The reason I'm giving it 5 stars despite my minor complains is because it is exactly what I expected out of a tablet. I've seen the other tablets out there, and this is by far the best one I've seen/used. (1/17/12) If you get the Prime, it is really worth it to get the dock as well. They work beautifully together, and it is awesome that you can just rip the screen off of your netbook whenever you want to watch movies on the couch. I highly recommend this device to anyone looking to take the plunge into Android tablets.", "Date": "January 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Asus Transformer Prime 32 GB Champagne Gold - Review Updated 01/23/12!!!", "Author": "Jason Harrell", "ReviewID": "RGYQA07TCJQY9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "****Update January 23, 2012:  I thought I would post that I have decided to return my Prime TF201.  I'm on my second one actually because of a few problems.  I still think that this is a great device for those that aren't having the problems.  But for me, it just wasn't worth the hassle.I have 2 problems.  First are the physical defect on both that I received.  The first one, as I mentioned below in my initial review, was the scratch on the Gorilla Glass.  Had I put the scratch there, I wouldn't have a problem because it isn't scratch proof, rather, it is only scratch resistant.  So I went on to tablet #2 and there are no scratches on the screen this time, however, there are dents on the silver border around the screen when looking at it straight on.  One at the top and 2 at the bottom.  While this may not bother some, I'm paying good money for this and I want it as close to flawless as possible.  Also, the port for charging seems to be dented a little as well.  It still fit the charger, but it looks like someone pressed really hard on the metal around the port and bent it downward.  AGHHProblem 2:  The second problem, on both devices is that once upgraded to ICS, I have numerous lockups and reboot problems.  Too many to consider keeping it.  I feel that this isn't really the Prime's fault but more an ICS problem, and may be fixed in a future update, but I can't take it.  On the first tablet, it happens while doing any simple task, like scrolling thru a page on the default browser, or playing a simple game, or using the camera.  It is just not acceptable for me.  It locks up for about what seems to be 20 seconds, then automatically reboots itself.  Then it is good for a short while, like 15 minutes, and then it does the same thing.  I really hate making this decision but it just has to be done.  Also, for those concerned, the GPS update seemed to help mine slightly for locking onto satellites with no WIFI turned on, but was still not very strong. And the Wifi strength, after careful testing and review, was just too weak.  Dropping it a star due to both of them having physical defects.****Update January 9, 2012:  I just received my Ice Cream Sandwich update to 4.0.3 and it went smoothly,  plus there was another camera update as well right afterwards.  When the tablet boots up now, it gives the option to unlock and go to the main screen if you swipe to the right, or go straight to the camera if you swipe to the left.I was hoping for the ability to move apps to the SD card, but no such luck yet.  Mine is not rooted.  Although my bootup time went from 3 mins 30 secs down to 1 min 31 secs with ICS then even down to 1 min 20 secs the next time I booted up.  I like the long hold on the main screen for Live Wallpapers and plain photo wallpapers.For those that thought ICS may improve GPS functionality, it did not for mine.  I figured as much, but thought I'd test it out.  Wifi seems the same as before the update.  Though mine seems very good cause I'm always near the router.  (But like I said below, I'm NOT using this for GPS functionality.  If you are, and you like the Prime for the specs, wait for the new Prime TF700t.  Even though in my opinion, it doesn't look as nice and it costs more.  Or wait for the smaller 7\" tablet, unnamed as of yet, which will also run ICS and have the Tegra 3 processor.  ANd it will only be $249.00.  Or look around.  Lots to choose from.)Looks like they also included an updated version of the web browser.  I also see a Downloads App in the app section.I like the transitions from screen to screen in the app section as well.  Although, while scrolling to the Widgets section after the apps, mine just locked up and this was after 5 mins from a fresh boot.  Not sure what that was about.  I couldn't do anything but the tablet rebooted on its own.  I'm sure there will be updates to come to clear any glitches.****Update January 3, 2012:  for those concerned about the locked bootloader, Asus made an announcement they they will provide an unlock key to allow root access at the risk of the user voiding the warranty.  Here is hoping that Asus holds true to their promise, but they usually do.  GPS is another issue for those concerned about it.  I put my star rating back to 5 because Asus has been very good with updates and listening to the buyers.  I just wish there was a way to get a plastic backing to replace the aluminum one for those that need GPS fixed to their wishes.  I hope you all are enjoying your Prime as much as I am.  And those of you waiting for yours to arrive, I'm  sure you will enjoy it, just be aware of the issues before getting it.  Or cancel your order and wait for a better option.  Don't  forget CES 2012 is right around the corner Jan 10-13.  Maybe there will be something more suited to your needs.****Update January 1, 2012:  I added a few photos to the image gallery here on Amazon that I took with the rear camera.  Keep in mind that the photo upload here does not allow the full sized image.  They seem to be compressed and shrunk down in size so you can't see it in full detail, but you get the idea, i hope.  Also, i noticed on Google Earth, everything freezes up after using it for a few minutes.  Then the tablet reboots itself.  This also happened on my original transformer as well.  Did anyone else notice this?  Even with these glitches that I mention, i am very happy with this tablet.  Just want to point out things that i notice when i play around with it.  I suspect that many things will run smoother when ICS comes along, or with future updates by Asus.  I know i mentioned it before but i have to stress how easy it is to clean the screen when the fingerprints get bad.  People seem to point out how easy it is to get fingerprints on it but nobody seems to say how easy they wipe off.  Lastly, i have been reading a lot of negative feedback about the gps.  I did say in my review how mine is slightly off and that for me this is not an issue since i really won't be using this function.  So if you are worried about very accurate gps, you may want to try the prime out at bestbuy or somewhere first.  I have a dedicated gps and cell phone that does gps for me.  I tested my Prime with the 'gps test' app and I lock onto 6 to 10 satellites within 20 seconds indoors but the strength rarely goes above 25 per satellite, (should be over 40). A lot of reviews on the old original transformer complained about the plastic backing, and Asus switches to aluminum and people complain because it blocks wifi and gps.  Watch what you wish for.  I'm still a very satisfied customer overall.****Update December 30, 2011:  Another update to my review.  I have noticed when recording a movie in HD, the auto focus is nice to have, but when it changes focus, upon playback you can hear clicking while it changes focus.  Nothing major but worth noting.  Also, when recording in lower light the movie can go out of focus.  I had to move the camera down to the floor then backto the subject for it to refocus.  Annoying, but tolerable.  Anyone else notice this?  I still love the tablet tho.****Update December 23, 2011:  I wanted to add an additional comment.  Please inspect your screen carefully.  When I got the tablet, I had noticed a small scratch on the Gorilla Glass screen in the upper right side.  I contemplated not doing anything about it, but finally decided that I paid good money for this and deserve a defective-free quality product.  I used Amazon's Help link and chatted online with someone who helped me resolve this rather quickly.  I will do a replacement of my tablet, and since it will be within the return timeframe, it will be at no cost to me.  My concern about this was that it is in high demand and I may not get the new one for quite a while.  I would rather wait a little longer and get a tablet that has no noticeable defect like this.  Some people may not have noticed it because it is a very fine scratch, but it is about 3/4 of an inch long.  I tried wiping it with the provided cloth, thinking it was something on the glass, but sure enough, it is a scratch.  I am currently dropping my star rating to 4 stars because of the promotion of the Gorilla Glass as being scratch resistant.  Here is a quote right from Gorilla Glass' website, \"Gorilla Glass features exceptional damage resistance to the scratches, drops, and bumps of everyday use.\"  I am one who takes extra special care of my electronics, and there was nothing that came into contact with the screen except my finger and the provided cloth.  Plus I noticed the scratch as soon as I opened it, but got more worried about it as the days went on.  I really hate to return it, but I can't see living with this, knowing that the screen may scratch even more later.  Maybe someone in the factory did something that caused it to scratch?  I have no idea, but I will be returning it for a new Tablet of the same model and color.  I thought it would be fair to mention this to other people considering buying it.  I really don't see this as an Asus issue as much as a Gorilla Glass (Corning) issue, but I like to be as fair as possible.  I will update again once I get my new replacement item.  Hopefully there will be no other worse defects.Also, for those that want to know, I ran the free AnTuTu Benchmark v2.5 and here are my results while using Honeycomb OS.RAM: 2109, CPU integer: 3662,  CPU float-point: 2794, 2D Graphics: 283, 3D Graphics: 1190, Database IO: 400, SD Card Write: (8.3 MB/s) 83, SD Card Read: (20.2 MB/s) 189, CPU Frequency: 1400 MHz, Total Score: 10710.  I did not test battery life, but it lasts a good while without having to recharge with everyday usage.Now back to my original review:OK, so I will start by saying that my Amazon order was not canceled, and I received my tablet on Tuesday December 20th.  So there was no problem for me as far as my order goes.  However, my docking keyboard still has yet to arrive.  Amazon says it should arrive around January 6th.Please note that I had the original Transformer, but I sold it to a friend and bought this one. So I will do my best to compare, but it has only been several hours that I got to play around with the new one so far.Am I glad I updated to this one, yes.  Are there major noticeable differences?  Some, but not drastic.  Obviously some new Tegra games cannot be played on the original Transformer, so there are the obvious hardware updates to this Prime model.The new operating system, due later, may make this tablet act completely different.  So I will update once that comes out also.Pros:* Tegra 3 chip makes for more powerful gaming with games that are designed for it, as well as overall performance improvements.* The enhancements on Honeycomb OS are subtle, but nice.  Hopefully ICS will be a HUGE improvement.* The screen has that special coating that they talked about, and although it does fingerprint up like crazy as with any touch screen tablet, it is SO much easier to clean off the prints.  Wow, it is nice.* The rear camera is a huge improvement over the previous model.  Perfect? no, but incredibly improved? yes. The auto focus is nice, although sometimes jittery when making a movie.  But overall it is great.* The rear camera has an LED flash now, which is very nice to have.* I like the gold color a lot more than I thought I would.  It is very subtle.* For only having one speaker this time around, I was impressed by the sound for both music and games and general sound bites.* They included a longer charging cable than the original 3 footer.  Looks to be about 5 foot this time around.  Thanks for that Asus.  The extra 2 feet seriously helps.* The overall-design looks and feels better than the original.* When I opened it, and booted up, I had 2 Asus updates ready for me.* Wifi speeds seemed the same as the previous model.  I didn't test it, just from using it and judging by memory.* The screen looks much improved from the original, even though it is the same resolution, the brightness helps and the colors look better.* Movies look amazing on this screen.* Adobe Flash sites work on this tablet.* Not sure why we need it, but there are 2 microphones this time around.* Asus implemented a new file manager which is really nice and easy to navigate.* Headphones connected sound amazing, and are in stereo. (I read others questioning if headphones would sound good or not)* HDMI port is not the same as the original Transformer.  This is Micro HDMI and the original was Mini HDMI.  But it looks great on my HD TV.Cons:* The Gorilla Glass, which is supposed to be scratch resistant, came with a scratch on it.  See my update above for details.* As far as design, the biggest complaint I have is that the power button is hard to press because it doesn't stick out far enough.  You have to try to press it to truly understand.  Took my a while the first few tries.* If you use it, the MicroSD card sticks out more than it did in the original.  Probably due to the Prime's curved edges.  Not a major flaw, but noticeable if you had the original Prime.* As per usual, the more apps you install, the longer the start-up boot time.  Not Asus' fault, but this is with any Android Tablet.  I have quite a few apps installed (I installed 107 apps myself), and while it still shuts down very quickly, it went from taking 30 seconds to boot, all the way up to 4 minutes and 10 seconds now.  That is a LONG boot up.  Like I said, before I installed my apps, it was only 30 seconds.  Anyone else experience this?* There have been a few glitches in some apps that I've used.  I will try to take note as to which ones and update on here.* Some movies that I had were not able to be played on the default player.  I downloaded MoboPlayer and the codecs and no problems now.* There is only one speaker.  Granted, it is great sound, but still only one speaker?  What were they thinking?  I guess it was a design limitation?  I have no idea here.  But it least it is loud and great quality for one speaker.Let me tell you that this one, compared to the original model, does not feel that different as far as noticing performance improvements. As I stated before, this may (or may not) change when we get the new ICS operating system later.  I don't want to sound biased and say that it will be amazing with ICS, but logically it makes sense that it will run smoother and faster overall, with the exception of older apps that aren't designed around the quad core, etc.So don't expect to see an astonishingly noticeable difference if you played with the original Transformer.I plan to upload some videos to youtube soon that show the use of the front and rear camera as well as some still photos.If I notice anything else, positive or negative about the Prime, I will post as soon as I get the chance.My overall review:  This was worth the extra money in my opinion.  I like to keep my gadgets up to date, and I loved the specs on this tablet.  If you have the extra money, I say go for it, or at least wait until ICS operating system comes out to hear if it really makes a big impact on performance, or to see if it is all hype.  It was a major bummer about the scratch on the front, but I am very particular about things like that when you pay over $100 for an item.  I hope that everyone gets theirs soon also, just don't forget to inspect your glass.  You only get a short time to return the item, so test it out.", "Date": "December 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Prime is (finally) charging; Time for a review!", "Author": "Tracey Zillian \"Always reading\"", "ReviewID": "R3EXTC6X467AFA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This review is going to be mostly about my experiences and the little things I've noticed from the Prime for the 2 days thus far that I've owned it. You all already know the specs (and they're pretty much entirely true). My Prime is an Amethyst Gray 32GB.INTRO:Let me start off with this: There are bugs. HOWEVER, keep in mind that this is a new tablet quite literally fresh off the press. For what it's worth, these bugs are pretty minor-- If you've ever owned an iPhone you're probably familiar with apps crashing for no good reason (unless I'm just very unlucky). Regardless, apps will occasionally crash on your Prime. There are, in my experience, two types of crashing: The rare crash that you just have to re-open the application and you're good to go, and the consistent crashing of a particular app when you start it. There are a fair number of the latter depending on the app (Tap Tap Revenge 4 being the main culprit for me-- I have yet to see the main screen) but most apps work perfectly fine. Myself, I've been playing World of Magic for about 5 hours straight now. Anyway.ONSCREEN KEYBOARD:The first thing I'd like to address is the onscreen keyboard. I don't have the keyboard dock yet (and I would really like to have it now, to be honest). I am an extremely fast (and accurate) typist, so slowing down is not something I'm used to. On my iPhone, I can type as fast as I care to with very few mistakes. This is not the case with the Prime. I have to type noticeably slower and with more care for the words to not mash themselves together in unintelligible fragments. Personally this irritates me, but I know that I type considerably faster than most people, so this is probably just a personal problem. I'm not going to downgrade this to 4 stars for that reason.SPEAKER:Oh my gosh, the speaker. You've probably heard about how there's only one- This is true. One or two speakers makes zero difference in this instance. This speaker is the best quality speaker I've ever heard. Better than my netbook, my iPhone, my laptop, all of them. While most speakers begin to get rather crackly as you crank up the volume, even at higher settings there is little to no 'extra noise' from this one. I've listened to music that was on Youtube with this speaker and it's absolutely stunning. If you need a tablet with a good speaker for whatever reason I highly recommend this one. You can definitely tell, if you're paying attention, that music is only coming out one side. But the quality makes that irrelevant. Onwards!SCREEN:The screen is beautiful. I've watched HD videos on it with extreme clarity and played games with beautiful graphics: All stunning. The screen is also quite responsive and you can switch through windows with ease. The brightness level is also very impressive. Even at almost 0 brightness, you can see things fairly easily. I generally keep the brightness on about 25%. In fact, anything too far above maybe 70% can be too bright if you are on a page with a lot of lighter colors. I haven't tested the screen outside yet but I don't think IPS+ is even going to be necessary for me. The screen is Gorilla glass if I recall correctly but I'm not going to test the strength of it. Not much else to add, unless anyone wants to ask a more specific question?BATTERY:The battery is also impressive. After 12 hours of letting it sit in its case and at least 10 hours of playing with it (at about 25% brightness, power saver mode) it was only at 63% battery life. I had to set the brightness to as high as I could bear and turn it on the highest power consumption setting, and play an MMO for a few hours before it finally got to 15% and it told me I might want to think about charging it soon. (I obliged, which is why I'm writing this review.) I've been charging it for I think a little less than an hour now and it's gone from 14% to 37%. 23% in an hour? For a machine like this, I think that's pretty impressive.INTERNET BROWSER:Good stuff, good stuff. It moves nice and quickly to the next page once you click something, and there are tabs. I'll add more once I've selectively used the browser more. Too busy playing with all my new apps! And on that note...APP STORE:It's not THE App Store. You should be aware of that. However it has all the big-name games from the Apple App Store, and sometimes, the same ones you have to pay for on the iTunes store are free on the Android market. There are sections for Free apps, Paid apps, and you can select your preferred type of app, just like in the iTunes market. The selection isn't as poor as people claim, in fact, there are a whole lot of apps already there, and it's only going to get bigger.FLASH:It has Flash! Built right in! I can access web pages now that I never could with an iDevice. Personally, that's a pretty considerable selling point.CAMERA:Now for the other type of flash. The Prime has two cameras, one rear-facing and one that looks right at you. The rear-facing one has flash capabilities; The front one doesn't. I don't know why you'd need to use the front-facing one save for Skyping and such anyway, so the flash isn't a big deal. The front camera doesn't have the same impressive quality as the back one, as well. The back camera, however, surprised me. A lot. After a few shots with it I quickly discovered that the camera on this tablet is of a higher quality than my actual camera, the likes of which is solely devoted to taking pictures. Indeed, the Prime's camera surpasses a device made for taking pictures. The quality really stands out, it's crisp and clean and if you're a good cameraman anyway that will only help with making it truly shine.The camera software itself has a lot of little settings that I haven't had the chance to play around with yet, but there is a button readily available that lets you switch from back to front cameras just by clicking it. The Prime's camera also takes video- Very nice quality video. Of course, taking pictures or video with a 10-inch tablet is a bit cumbersome and looks rather silly, but the quality that it provides makes it worth it.INCLUDED APPS:The Prime comes with a page (and then a few more) of pre-installed apps. They're pretty standard but they also have apps like the Kindle store already included, which I thought was nice. If you already have a Kindle account, you can log in on that app and all your books will be there for you to read. On that note, readability is nice, and you can resize the font to big or normal-sized.There was also an app called Polaris Office, which upon opening I discovered that it had access to every single file on my Prime, much like how you can look at your folders and files on the computer. On the top right, there is a 'Create New' option, which reveals nothing short of the ability to create Word documents, Powerpoint presentations, and Excel spreadsheets. Anyone who needs these things for work will appreciate that this comes built in. Any other applications you want to ask about, please go ahead.BOTTOM-OF-SCREEN-MENU-BUTTON:Because I'm not sure what else to call it. This little button allows you to, once you click it, see your battery life, power settings, Bluetooth options, screen-tilt options, another button to lead you to the main Settings window, and a personal favorite, a notifications section. This will tell you of any new events that happened on your tablet (or if you have Facebook, if someone has replied to a comment, etc) such as the completion of a new app download. On the bottom of your screen is also a thin black bar that shows when each separate download is occurring, and you can click the little download icons to see the status of each download. These disappear once your download is finished and go to the 'event' section of your menu. Downloads usually happen in a matter of seconds, but can take a few minutes if you're downloading a particularly large application or update. All in all very convenient.MULTITASKING SIDEBAR:This little sidebar starts off as a button, but when you press it, it reveals a sidebar with every window and application you have open on your tablet. You can click the icon of any of them to instantly switch to that application, or you can click the X on the side of them to close the application completely. I've yet to have any problems with the Prime slowing down from too many applications, but I usually try to X them out in groups when I remember that I haven't done so yet.SIZE/WEIGHT:This thing is LIGHT. It's a 10-inch tablet, but it's probably a third lighter than the Kindle Fire, an 8-incher.(or is it 7? Regardless.) In an effort to find a fairly standard item to compare it with, I would have to say as follows: It's lighter than what I consider a standard-sized hardcover novel, (In this case The Da Vinci Code, about 454 pages and bound rather nicely) not by much but still a noticeable difference. Coupled with the Kindle app you could read a thick hardcover novel for cheaper than the hardcover's asking price and it'll weigh less, too.Comparing it with my trusty copy of The Da Vinci Code again, it's about a half-inch longer than a 'standard' hardcover novel on each side. It appears to be about a pencil-width thick if not a bit less, however it slopes in at the edges so I can't quite tell. In short, this tablet is both impressively thin and incredibly light.ALL IN ALL:For all of you still waiting for your Prime to arrive from Amazon, Bestbuy (where mine actually eventually came from, I admit), Gamestop, or wherever else this was available for pre-ordering, I assure you, this is very worth it. It has its bugs at the moment but I've already received updates that download very quickly. (As a note, downloads do for the most part happen very quickly!) I'm very impressed with this tablet, and hope that you are too. If you haven't preordered this yet I highly recommend you do; You won't regret it.If there's anything here I haven't addressed yet, please feel free to ask about it. I'll answer as best I can. I'll also be editing this with new information as I find it.", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "The best tablet available at this time. Period!", "Author": "L. A. Dye \"700hpAMG\"", "ReviewID": "R551KD03GM496", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pre-ordered this late last year while owning the original Transformer with dock. Have now had this long enough to go through all of the paces including the dock (of which I went through 3 to find a perfect one).Originally I was going to purchase an iPad2 like so many others that cannot get past the Starbucks fascination of owning an Apple product. My primary concern with Apple products including my iPhone was the lack of real memory with Apple limiting any expansion in their products-though great otherwise. As I recently converted both of my phones over to Android phones, that pretty much clinched the purchase as purchasing and juggling two platforms made little sense. I did go at it slow originally as I wanted to ensure that the tools (apps) I require were both available and worked well on the Android system vs Apple. Now only were they available, even better options were to be found which was a pleasant surprise as a lot of junk apps are also on the Android Market.Now to the tablet:Breaking this down into simple terms:Pros:.Very fast. With quad core and an extra chip to handle video, this tablet is speed with ICS (Ice Cream Sandwich). With exception to browsing (Dolphin HD) which is just OK. Try out Opera..Battery life:  An honest 9 hrs+ with just tablet and over 17 hrs with the dock. Even while watching movies the battery drains very slowly. Very impressive. Also, the dock charges the tablet when connected..Styling. Extremely nice and modern style. All aluminum (which is also it's greatest sin). This tablet is hot looking. I have tghe champagne version which is more like a light metallic bronze..Expandability: Micro HDMI, USB (dock), miniSD. I have a 128gb microSD card for a total of 192gb in the tablet alone and a 64gb in the dock for a total of 256gb. I have a large amount of HD movies, games, photos, apps, etc. All play very well from the cards with no hiccups of any sort. Native USB mouse support and native PS3 controller support via USB. Just plug and go, no ROM needed. Also, the mentioned dock is an exceptional accessory. It adds battery life, USB, looks great, fits well , and really does complete the package..Video playback. Another win over iPhone is the ability to play a wide array of movie formats which Apple can be stubborn about. Playback is very smooth, bright, and you can easily scroll forward or back with no delay or crashes. Very impressive..Graphics:  Superb, the best available on a tablet at the moment. Just youtube comparisons of Shadowgun and Riptide vs. the iPad2 and you will see the dramatic improvements over the iPad and original Transformer..WIFI:  LOL.  Many complain about the WIFI as the aluminum backing does inhibit the signal. However my particular model has great WIFI and downloads faster than any tablet prior. No issues at all here. Additionally, I Hotspot off of my 4G Android phones, again no issues. No fee either through my carrier..Screen: Large 10.1\" screen with Gorilla Glass and highest tablet resolution at the moment. Very strong, very bright IPS, even outdoors. Movies and games look great along with spreadsheets.CONS.Lack of accessories such as cases with the tablet/dock (current versions are designed incorrectly resulting in too thick of material between dock and tablet hinge.) Ton of stuff available for iPads and the original Transformer (those will not fit the Prime).GPS. Yep, I do not use it on a tablet, but it is advertised (before), and the signal is blocked by that gorgeous aluminum backing. Simply does not work on mine. EDIT: Recent firmwares have improved this and it does now lock onto over 12 satellites though still not great for driving.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Recent airplane trip. Edited a few spreadsheets, tired of that, decided to watch a full length HD movie, then connect my PS3 controller and played Shadowgun. The guy sitting next to me and another across from the aisle were blown away with this tablet sparking plenty of conversation. It is an impressive piece which has a tendency to draw people into your business. Expect it unless your doing something boring. Using it in the AM, then at the terminal, on the flight, I still had over 80% of total battery left. I did not even bother taking out my laptop.Overall with dock and memory cards (2) it was a bit expensive, however at the end of the day, well worth it IMO..", "Date": "March 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Tablet Ever!!!", "Author": "Bucko678", "ReviewID": "R221DJ1IL4T08C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I finally received my prime two days ago.  I must admit that I was concerned about the build quality after reading many accounts of issues that were experienced by those that received the first batch.  If you're still waiting on your preorder, consider yourself lucky, as I've encountered no issues thus far.  My build is 8.8.3.27.Rather than go over the specs, yet again, I will focus instead on the elements that have received all of the bad press.Wifi:  I don't doubt that wifi issues delayed the release of the prime.  As such, the first thing I did was connect to my home network and install speedtest.  I was shocked to see the meter register a blistering and consistent 7mb/s, greatly exceeding the 5mb/s that my htc evo 4g registers.  I've read that ASUS added another wifi antenna to resolve the connectivity issues. I can't confirm this to be true, but I can confirm that I have no wifi issues.GPS:  I've read that some people were unable to get a gps lock. While I don't anticipate using this functionality for navigation, I still wanted to confirm that my unit did not have this defect.  To test the gps, I downloaded gps status from the market.  I turned off my network connection, and stood in my back yard with the prime level to the ground.  I locked on 8 satelites in less than two minutes.Light bleed:  I read numerous complaints about light bleed resulting from mis-alignment of the glass.  To test my unit I downloaded backlight bleed test from the market.  Although there was a negligible amount of bleed on the bottom right corner, in normal use I did not notice any bleed at all.Browser lag and force closes:  Yes, it's true.  The stock browser has some lag, and a few apps force closed.  This is true of any honeycomb tablet.  Thankfully, ice scream sandwich will be rolled out in January.  ICS will optimize the hardware of the prime, and every indication is that the lag will be gone.  Note that I'm running ICS on my Evo, and it runs like butter.Overall, the prime has thus far exceeded all of my expectations.  My only complaint is that I have yet to receive my keyboard dock...Updated 1/2/2012:I awoke this morning to some disappointing news.  Apparently ASUS chose to deliberately lock and encrypt the bootloader, thus restricting ones ability to load customizations.  For most potential owners, this is not a big deal.  For myself and many others, it is a potential deal breaker.  I choose android over ios primarily because I appreciate my freedom.  Android allows me to completely control my user experience.  I was an eary adopter of the evo 4g phone. Since I purchased that phone, many others with improved bells and whistles have come onto the market.  Having an unlocked bootloader gives me the ability to constantly make my phone feel new.  As I mention below, I'm currently running an alpha version of ice cream sandwich on my phone, despite the fact that my phone is not on the upgrade list.  This is because Google chose to make andoid an open platform.  Open is the philosophy that differentiates android from apple.  For a manufactorer to create a device designed for android enthusiasts, but not subscribe to the open philosophy of android is extremely unfortunate.  Unless ASUS changes coarse on this point, they will stifle the potential of this otherwise exceptional device.Since I relize that the above will not impact most potential buyers, I'm deducting only one star.  If this was a review posted to an enthusiast site, the device would earn only 3 stars.1/3/2012:ASUS agreed to unlock the bootloader if the device owner agrees to opt-out of the warranty.  For myself, this is awesome news.  Now I will be able to install android versions that ASUS does not support on the device (Jelly Bean?).  I am still extremely happy with the unit.  I will not unlock the bootloader for the forseeable future.  Once I am satisfied that my unit has no hardware defects, I will opt out of the warranty and bring back the newness.I applaud ASUS for reacting to their customer's needs and have restored my original 5-star rating.", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Tablet I've Used", "Author": "Ian Mcmanis", "ReviewID": "R1KYD98F8GOMU3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After waiting nearly a full month to get my hands on one of these elusive tablets, I managed to get lucky enough to find one at a local store. At this point, you've probably read reviews from tech experts and critics that do this for a living, so I'll spare the technical details and go for usability from the perspective of a moderately technologically savvy aficionado.As a previous owner of an iPad 2, I returned mine because of the strict usage requirements forced by Apple and the iOS, I can say the Asus Transformer Prime feels nearly the same in my hands as does an iPad 2. The curved edges and cool metal back feel sturdy and comfortable in my hands. When holding the device in landscape mode, it is noticeably wider than the iPad 2, making it difficult to hit the middle keys with my thumbs. I have yet to acquire the keyboard dock, but until then switching to portrait mode works fine when typing in long segments. The screen gets finger smudges just as noticeably as iPad 2, but the gorilla glass makes removing as easy as using the palm of your hand.There's been some concern over the one speaker located directly where my right hand rests while holding the tablet in landscape mode. To me, this is an extremely nitpicky con since the speaker is louder than iPad or any tablet I've experienced to date even when I am trying to cover it with my hand. Still, there is a 8 mm headphone jack if you're trying to get the full quality experience.The front facing camera (1.2 megapixel) is located just a little right of center when holding the device in landscape mode, which is a bit awkward considering I'm used to the portrait video chat of FaceTime on the iPad 2. It's about par quality with any front-facing camera I've come into contact with, and not really useful for anything else. The rear facing camera is excellent. I have two android phones, one with 8 megapixel and xenon flash and the other 5 megapixel with no flash, and this camera (8 megapixel) beats both of them with superior autofocus and a bright flash for night-time pictures. It's no Canon Rebel by any means, but perfect for photo-journaling and all casual picture needs.Along with the tablet, you'll find a nice, long (4 ft.) USB cable and a AC power adapter. It's important to note that this device does not charge via micro USB so you'll have to keep track of this new charger for all of your devices. Also, if you plan to do any HDMI streaming to an HDTV or monitor, you'll need to purchase a Micro HDMI to HMDI cord separately.I was able to download Android 4.0 ICS right out of the box, and it does look beautiful on the super IPS display. I'm assuming you've read all you need to know about how nice the screen swipes with ICS, and the browser is so much nicer, etc. One thing they don't talk about is using the device through an HDTV using the micro HDMI output. This has been my favorite thing about the Prime so far. The picture on my 55\" Samsung HDTV is pristine. Streaming video through Youtube or Netflix is perfect quality. Games such as Shadowgun, Galaxy on Fire 2, and Blood and Glory could easily be mistaken for Xbox 360. I am incredibly exited to see what developers will do to exercise the Nvidia Tegra 3 chip in the coming months.Putting the fact that my WiFi and GPS work perfectly behind, the most concern for this tablet is caused by the Android Appstore and the lack of tablet optimized apps. While this is currently true, every app that I used on a daily basis on my iPad 2 I have found an equal or better substitute on my Prime. All I needed to do was Google \"Best Android Tablet Apps\" and there were 10 lists available with useful free and paid apps that are made for a larger screen. Also, with the release of ICS, I expect developers are hard at work creating a slew of new apps that will bolster the number of available tablet optimized applications.One last huge pro about the Android OS is the freedom to use it for whatever purpose you see fit. If you want to have one home screen dedicated to weather and clock widgets from around the globe, you can. If you want to download music or video directly to the tablet's internal memory, or expandable SD card, you can do that as well. Google offers the exact same services that iTunes and the Apple Appstore does, but also allows you to choose other options. I can wirelessly transfer files and media from my android phone to my Prime to my 5 year old Macbook or a friend's PC and back. This freedom is the main reason I returned my iPad and opted for an Android tablet.Make no mistake, the iPad 2 is a beautifully simple device that does exactly what consumers want it to do. It's just as fast, the display is just as crisp, and it has more Apps than you will ever be able to use. Having to explore multiple places to discover all of the settings and preferences and options you can tweak on the Prime is daunting if you're not used to it. But in my opinion, the Asus Transformer Prime is not only the best Android Tablet, but the best tablet on the market to date. I look forward to seeing developers make games and Apps that make it shine like it is supposed to.", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Parting is Such Sweet Sorrow .. Not Ready for Prime Time", "Author": "P. Rudy", "ReviewID": "R1BXQDBCAFO9KW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have just sent back my third Prime.  I am done.I really wanted to love it.  It started last November.  Preordered, then got cancelled, then reordered, then delayed, then the problems  wifi/gps, etc. starting happening. I donot care about GPS, but wifi is critical.  I am not a gamer. I don't spend my life on Facebook or Twitter.  I am professional and I really wanted to use the Prime in my business and personal reading.My first Prime had horrible wifi -- even when I upgraded to a expensive Asus AP route.  Second one was a bit better -- but lots forced closings and it seems like updates almost daily. And if i pressed the top of the tablet hard, the wifi improved. Boy, that made me feel happy. So, now on my third Prime, with decent wifi -- still 25% worse than a OG Transformer and still fluctuates all the way down to 3mps.  On Speedtest, I get 20mps on an OG and usually 12 to 15 mps on the Prime, but sometime 3.  But, it basically worked, after two and half months of screwing around with returns, updates, hacks, fixes, reading up every night on the blogs to get tips on making the Prime perform smoothly.On Friday walked by the Apple store.  Walked in and found out I could get a Ipad 3 for two weeks and return it if I didn't like it.  What the hell, thought I would check out the competition.  Never owned an Apple product (oh, have an Ipod but dont use it now that I have an android phone.)After all the heartache ordering, reordering, calling Asus support(boy, that is waste of time), I found the experience in the Apple store was so, so, normal. I walked in, spoke with a person an intelligent person that explained the unit, demonstrated it, did the order and then introduced me to the supervisor for business users.  He then explained the free seminars for business use, took my email and set me up for the next seminar.After two hours using the Ipad 3, I packaged up the Prime to return.  The Ipad3 just works.  No issues, no rebooting, no updates upon opening, I am getting 21mps wifi.  The screen really is amazing.  And tons of apps that work. Tons of apps made for a tablet.I really do not want to become a hacker to keep the Prime working.  With all the issues, I simply do not trust the Asus and the Prime to function.  I now read of all the issues with the year old OG Transformers, with dieing power buttons and the ICS update that bricked many units.Back with all ordering problems for the Prime, I gave Asus a break -- hey, the unit is popular.  I was perturbed with the reviewers here on Amazon that gave bad marks because of the botched up ordered process.  I thought that unfair, but not now.  The roll out of the Prime was an abomination for a consumer device from a major manufacturing company -- and it still goes on.The aluminum case of the Prime, in my opinion, is either a design flaw or faulty in-house testing standards / lack of real world testing.  Asus, to its credit, has done LOTS of work fixing the issue to get the wifi decent.  But, I really do not a product that was miss-designed and the manufacturer came up with a patch after patch after patch to get the wifi to be \"decent.\"  Asus makes such great computer components: motherboards, video cards.  But those are commodities, not consumer products.  Judging by what I have read about issues with Asus laptops, I have come to the conclusion that the billion dollar computer parts manufacturing Asus really does not know how to design, manufacturer, roll-out and support consumer products.Yes, I know the TF700T is coming, eventually.  And Asus tacitly admitted the wifi gps issues by designing a new back.  But when the TF700t comes out is anyone's guess.  After the backlogs with OG Transformer, then the abysmal roll-out of the Prime, I for one do not have any faith in how and when Asus will handle the 700t.  AND, to be honest, I was pissed that Asus announced the 700T when I was still struggling to get a Prime, and then get it working.No, I did not drink the Apple Cool-aid. I am not in love with Apple, but I really like the Ipad3. It works, it looks good and I really could care less if anyone thinks I am cool for having one. In fact, I purposely stayed away from Apple because I did not want to be associated with the cool-aid drinking converts, zealots.  I do not like iPhones and think that my HTC EVO 4G is far superior.  Android does phones well.  While ICS is nice, it still has a way to go to be a smooth operating system on tablets. Philosophically, I love the idea of the open ecosystem of Android.  But, at this point, I would rather have the closed Apple system that works.Sorry to write so much, but I have spent hours reading the Amazon reviews since December on the Prime, looking for suggestions and guidance and solace.  No more.  I have invested so much time, energy and money on the Prime, that I needed to vent.  Good luck to those with the Prime and use it in good health.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Beautifully built tablet, but...", "Author": "Rance", "ReviewID": "R1YHCJNHQOIBOU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Asus has designed a gorgeous tablet, with great features and aesthetics, but it isn't lacking in the fail department either. I'll get into the flaws later.First off, I loved the Transformer TF101. For my first tablet, I was absolutely amazed by the features Asus packed into it, along with top notch functionality. I used the original Transformer for everything, but in the end it just felt overweight and clunky. Man was that an awkward, and heavy tablet to hold for long periods! In steps the Prime, making its debut with the announcement from Asus only a month after I bought my TF101. My head got filled with ideas of something just as functional as my TF101, only newer, shinier, thinner, and most importantly LIGHTER! I sold my Transformer, and ordered the 32GB Prime the minute Amazon posted it... Then, I waited... and waited... and...Once I had the Transformer Prime in my hands, I immediately noticed how closely it resembled my neighbor's iPad2 in terms of weight/feel. Fantastic! The display is absolutely amazing, and the Tegra 3 processor is a beast! Gaming is awesome on the Prime, as I expected, but what about the Prime's usefulness in other areas that I used my TF101 for daily?Right off the bat, I noticed that the WiFi signal in my home was very weak, even 20 feet away from my router. I average about 2 bars of signal strength throughout my home if I'm lucky (with the original Transformer, I had full signal throughout). I brushed that off thinking that software might be to blame, so on to the next test. GPS.With my original TF, the GPS worked like a clock. With the Prime, it takes 10 minutes, at least, to get a lock on 3 or 4 satellites, only to find out that the Prime thinks I'm 200ft away from where I'm actually standing. The accuracy is HORRIBLE, and POOF! 3 seconds later, the Prime is searching for satellites again for another 5-10 minutes! A little searching around online, and I found out that there are a whole lot of people having the exact same issues I am, which brings me back to design.The metal backing on the Prime seems to have a negative effect on the WiFi signal, and the GPS reception, making both signals spotty and unreliable. I'm no longer convinced, after testing dozens of different apps for both WiFi and GPS, that this is a software issue. This is definitely an issue with faulty hardware, or a serious design flaw. Right now, I'm kicking myself for getting rid of my original TF and hopping on the \"new and shiny\" bandwagon like an Apple fanboy.I'm going to contact Amazon for a replacement to see if I might have received a defective unit (hopefully), but at this time, I can only give the Prime 2 stars. 1 star for the look/feel of the tablet, and another for the excellent display. I will update this review once my replacement arrives (hopefully sometime this quarter).Update: Since Asus has decided to come forward and admit that there is a major design flaw in the Prime, and removed GPS from their list of features, I've decided to ask Amazon for a refund instead of waiting for a replacement. For my money, I am pretty sure I can do much better with all the new tech coming out soon. Thanks to all who have contributed their experiences, and comments.", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Initial Thoughts", "Author": "Callmemike", "ReviewID": "R1AFFEEXDVMRRE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received my TP Saturday morning, 4 days ahead of the estimated delivery date with Super Saver Shipping.  Lucky for me it was a very light weekend, so I had plenty of time to use it.  As soon as I turned it on, it started updating itself, and within 10 minutes I had Android ICS and a camera update installed with no effort on my part.I'm really a freak for electronics, and though I can't afford to actually go out and buy everything that comes out, I can certainly appreciate nice new devices.  I just bought my wife an iPad 2 a week ago.  She's been using an iPhone for a while now and likes it, so it made more sense to keep her in something that didn't require learning a new device.  Same chargers, apps, etc.  I also use an iPhone, but I've been using an Asus laptop for awhile and really like the quality of their products.  I also carry an Android phone for work, so I'm fairly familiar with the OS, apps, etc.I say all that to preface the fact that I've got both the iPad 2 and the Transformer Prime to compare, and I own an Asus netbook, an Asus 17\" laptop, an iPhone 4s, and an iPhone 3gs. I'm not on anyone's \"bandwagon\", I just like different devices for different applications.The Prime is beautiful.  I know that doesn't have anything to do with performance, but it needs to be said.  The spun-metal back doesn't show fingerprints at all, but I'll agree with the other reviewers that have said the front is a fingerprint MAGNET.  The included cleaning cloth works very well on the Gorilla Glass, though, so I'll keep it handy.  The tablet feels solid... one advantage of the metal back plate.  It doesn't feel as though it would flex at all.  The corners are just rounded enough that they don't dig into your hands while you're holding it.  It would be a little heavy to hold up to read while lying in bed, but I purchased a pretty nice case with it that converts to a stand:  MoKo(TM) Premium Quality Slim-Fit Folio Cover Case with built-in Multi-Angle Stand for Asus Eee Pad Transformer Prime TF201 10.1-Inch Android TabletThe screen is extremely clear and bright, and with the tablet set in \"Balanced\" performance mode, \"Super IPS\" turned on, brightness set on \"Auto\", I never noticed the transitions in brightness (but it did change, I just didn't notice when it happened like on some devices).  I think you could easily sit outside on a bright day and read fairly easily with this tablet.  Also, using the aforementioned settings, I got close to 10 hours out of a full charge.  That may not seem like a big deal, since that's what the specs call for, but I was using this thing HARD for the first full day.  We all know that when a manufacturer calls out battery life, it's normally based on best-case scenarios.  I do fully intend to add the optional keyboard dock later, which adds additional battery life and more port options.The screen transitions are very fluid.  I downloaded Riptide and a couple other games and they are very, very smooth.  I especially like the ice cube Live Wallpaper that also indicates battery level.  I've been using Google for mail, docs, calendars, etc. for several years now, so I was very happy to see how well all those are integrated.  You're not locked into using the Google stuff though, and setup was very easy when adding my email account from work.  I was a little concerned about there not being any kind of tactile \"home button\", but having all the controls integrated to touch-type controls feels very natural after a few minutes of use.  All the touch points to access system functions are intuitively placed.  I read a couple reviews about the power button and volume rocker being too small and poorly placed, but I didn't find them difficult or inconvenient to use, other than the fact that when you're looking at the tablet in landscape mode, both of those are located in the top left corner of the device.  If you hold it in portrait mode, they're positioned in the more natural-feeling upper right hand corner (I'm right-handed).  In the 20+ hours that I spent messing with it this weekend, I only had it in portrait mode for a few minutes.  Everything looks and functions quite well in landscape mode.The touch screen is very responsive, pinching functions are smooth as well.  Zooming, scrolling, and \"swiping\" operations are handled easily with no lag or stutter.User setup options and preferences are extensive, which is one thing I personally like compared to the IP2.  I love customization, and this device allows plenty of it.  My wife loathes \"tweaking\", which made the IP2 a better choice for her.My wireless network showed up right away and connected without incident, and signal seems to be fine everywhere in the house.  We have 2 wireless routers, one in the basement and one on the second floor, and it automatically switched to the strongest signal in relation to where I was in the house.  I can get an adequate signal from the router in the basement while in all the rooms of the house, so the recent reviews of poor WiFi signal reception don't seem to be an issue for me.I didn't take the unit out and drive around to see how will the GPS works, because honestly that's not what I bought it for, but it worked fine in the house with Google Maps and Latitude.I read some stuff on the Kindle app, and watched several shows on Netflix.  Loading and playback of all types of media is fast and very, very smooth.  I'm going to start working with some other apps like SplashTop Remote and some other boring apps that relate more to work than play.  I did set up and access my personal laptop with SplashTop.. the tablet is a much better option for remote access than a phone.All in all, I'm VERY pleased with my decision to purchase this tablet.  The build quality is as good as I expected from Asus, and the performance is better than I had hoped for.  I understand that the next version of this tablet is already in development and may possibly be released within a few months, but such is the timeline for technology.", "Date": "February 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "ASUS ALREADY HAD IMPROVED SHELL DESIGN BEFORE RELEASING PRIME", "Author": "S. Smith", "ReviewID": "R31MFD3OGV99WI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This first paragraph is all you need to read. Everything else was prior to latest news. Asus has already announced another version of the Prime for Q2 and it has a redesigned shell to improve Wifi, GPS and Bluetooth !!!  With this being announced so early, before the original Prime has even been able to hit store shelves, its very obvious that Asus knew about the wireless issues of the Prime prior to releasing them. Rather than delay (remember rumored delays due to Wifi issues)and fix the issue they pushed the Primes out in time for good holiday sells, knowing it was flawed. All the time a new designed shell was already in the works and even possibly already in hand. Asus did add higher resolution screen on the new model but its likely this was to merit releasing it has a \"different\" Prime. Very poor move by Asus. I recommend not buying the Prime or the new version Prime.Below is a list of signficant flaws to consider when making your purchase decision. Please read the UPDATE sections below for more specific notes.1. Poor GPS caused by aluminum shell design2. Reduces Wifi range and performance (likely due to same shell as well)3. Drastically reduced Wifi performance when connected to and/or streaming to bluetooth device capable of music / video streams.UPDATE !!! So the issues keep coming. It is known now that there is an issue with using Bluetooh and Wifi at the same time. I have tested this myself and it seems to depend on exactly what the bluetooth is being used for. When used to stream music to a bluetooth headset or stereo, WiFi transfer rate is dramatically impacted.  I tested without bluetooth and was getting 13000 range kbps. With bluetooth streaming on the transfer dropped to 400 kbps and lower. This will be an issue for those that might like to stream music to their entertainment center while browsing on the Prime.UPDATE !!!! Asus has issued a statement concerning GPS issue. They have admitted it is due to the shell and will no longer list or market GPS as a feature. My review started off as 4 stars but to me this is a significant screw up and a sign of poor QC. Whats worse is that early rumors of delayed release due to Wifi issues shows that Asus knew of the problem then but decided Christmas sells were more important than delivering a product that worked the way it should. WiFi issues have also been confirmed and are due to the shell however the WiFi signal is still strong enough to work, but it could be and should be better.WiFi is also not optimal and with 3 units tested I found all three to have significantly shorter range than other devices like iPad 2, iPhone, laptop. Transfer speeds over Wifi are also slower. With all the devices running the same test and sitting the same distance from the router, the Prime came up with slower tranfers. As the distance from the wireless router was increased for each device, the transfer rates for the Prime suffered more than the other devices. So for example moving all devices to a bedroom 40 feet away with two walls between them and the wireless router, all the devices, except for the prime, showed the same level of transfer loss. The Prime on the other hand showed a greater loss.WATCH THIS VIDEO to see that the Prime does have WiFi performance issues.  [...]UPDATE !!!!  Well the rumored GPS issues were apparently real. So real in fact that Asus is no longer listing GPS as a feature of the Prime. Check the Asus site if you doubt. You might find it listed on other sites but that is only because ASUS does not have access to those sites to remove it.  This tells me that the GPS issue is more than likely due to a design flaw and since they are removing it from the list they will most certainly not continue trying to fix it,  because it probably cannot be fixed.  I had to take away a star for this reason.  Very shady tactic on part of Asus. Of course Zealots will brush this off as being an unimportant feature, even though they were sure to point it out as a great included feature that you must pay extra for on the iPad 2. I also forsee Asus adding it back to the specs but it will be for legal reasons only.I was lucky enough to get my hands on 3 of these, two of which were not even Pre Orders. One was a walk in to BB and the other online order from BB, which took only 3 days to process and ship to me. One was from Santa for my 11 year old daughter and the other two for me and my wife.I'm starting the Prime off with 5 stars and deducting or adding back as I go.- 2 Stars - Faulty GPS. Asus either did not test GPS or knew there was an issue and released it anyway. Either way is not good.Asus has removed GPS from the list of features on the Prime and admitted it is due to the shell.- 1/3 Star - BackLight Bleeding on all three.When held in landscape mode the location of the light bleed is on the right side just below the corner. The bleed is not subtle either. On two of the units there are two distinct sections next to eachother. On the third unit its one less distinct area. Being in the same location I am wondering if its a quality control or design issue. It does not stand out under normal use unless that area is dark and has no graphics to cover it. It will stand out during movies when that section is dark.- 1/3 Star - Case / Glass separation on all three.The next thing noticed on all three is a cracking sound when holding along the left side in landscape mode near the volume rocker. If you press there you can see the glass move in as you press.  I think this is a design issue and maybe has something to do with the volume rocker. When viewed from the side (thin view), you can see the glass sticks up slightly higher there. Its as if the glass was suppose to be snapped in but it did not hold.- 1/3 Star - Crashes and Interface issues.I should not really deduct for the OS Interface since its probably not the fault of the device but since it is a part of the device I will. We have experienced crashes although not in excess. Its usually on the browser. I also find that sometimes tapping an icon is not responsive and you must tap several times. Its as if the touch screen stops sensing. This was noticed on the Xoom and the Fire as well so I would say its an OS issue.+ 1 Star - Is for the performance and overall experience with the device. This thing is fast and that is using it in the mid performance setting.Boot Time -  YIKES !!  1 minute boot time ! I will not deduct from this because we generally will let it sleep and not power off until night time.Sound - The speaker seems sufficient to me. I would not have a problem using it for watching a movie or gaming as long as there were not others around that might be annoyed.Screen - The screen looks amazing. Viewing angles seems to be very good. For example sitting at the end of couch with the Prime facing me directly, my daughter and wife sitting to my left could view without having to lean back and over towards me.Quality - In my opinion could have been better, specifically the backlight bleed and cracking along edge that I already pointed out. If those were not present I would not have anything negative to say about the quality of the prime.Is this an iPad2 killer ? I do not think so. If you hate Apple then of course you will think it is. Heck the Apple haters thought the Xoom was the iPad 2 killer. I'm not a hater or zealot of either side. Fact is Apple has really polished their OS. I think once the Android OS gets polished and tweaked a bit that I would definitely put the Prime on top. Maybe the next update in January 2012 ?  If the update is focused on improvements to the current OS and not just a bunch of new features that will open up new problems then I think it will be very promising. I have my fingers crossed.<<<UPDATE>>>  I exchanged one our Primes, which had the worst backlight bleed, at our local BB. The replacement was much better. The cracking / moving glass near volume rocker is not there. Bleed is so minor that I would call it no bleed at all; however the minor bleed I can see is in the same exact spot as the others. I also researched some and found a review that mentioned the bleed and it was in the same location as well.I have been reading complaints for WiFi and GPS issues. I have no way to test the wifi speed but must admit that I see constant fluctuation of signal strenght on the Prime. Apparently the GPS issue is signal strength related. What I have read is that it is strong enough to lock on and give your location but not strong enough to maintain a lock if mobile, for example if you were trying to use it for navigation from point A to B.", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Better than iPad 2...as you already know.", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2SUWWUM2HBPOW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My Prime was a gift for Christmas, which I finally got my hands on 1/1/2012 (was on vacation when it delivered 12/28 via BestBuy). In the 28 hours I've had it, I've fallen in love with the simplicity. I even broke out an iPad 2 to do some comparisons. So far, with the camera update and such, the video and camera is better than the iPad; web is quick; gameplay is gorgeous; only a few minor bugs with sensitivity (it really needs a precise touch for closing programs and moving apps on home screen). You want a more detailed review, just search the ones already on Amazon; they are way more tech-savvy than I.I don't care about the bootloader, although it seems to be a really big issue for everyone reviewing the Prime. As the product is intended to be, the Prime is amazing; reviews that say otherwise are bogus, although I understand wanting the bootloader lock removed (but that should not equal 1-star ratings, guys! Come on!). No WiFi issues, but I have noticed the signal will say it is low; when I do a speed test, I get 5mbps, which makes me think the signal indicator is the issue, not the actual WiFi. However, I am not a pro.I'm a student, so this should come in handy so I don't have to lug 10 pound texts + laptop + notebook everywhere I go. SuperNote is pretty awesome on it.

They will allow unlock.***update 1.21.12***After ICS update, my Prime showed a dead pixel and would show black horizontal lines. I found a replacement at Best Buy nearby and exchanged it. The new one has no issues that I've found. I tested the WiFi speed: 17.44 d/l and 3.44 up. Same as the iPhone in my house and Bionic Droid.I have also gotten my hands on the dock. I'm loving it. When the Prime reaches 70%, the dock charges it, but the dock dies very quickly compared to what I was expecting (but I'm always using it).So, yes, many Primes have flaws. Not all.***update 3.29.12***Okay, so now that I've used this thing daily since the beginning of the year, I wanted to give some more feedback. I'm a graduate student, so I use this thing for school all the time. Most of what we read is in .pdf format, so I love that I can switch between notes and reading; it's easy to take the dock off when needed. (If you're a student like me, apps you'll want: EZ PDF, because you can annotate most .pdf files; QuickOffice, because I hated the stock processor, and I can't stand Google Docs; SplashTop is pretty cool, in case I forget a file on my computer at home.)I use this thing to read. No issues with daylight reading, and without the dock, it lasted my from 7AM to 4AM with a lot of reading (I'm on Spring Break). When I game, it handles it perfectly, and I love the graphics. I usually keep it in battery saver mode unless I want to play games.About the dock: while there are some issues with the rubber things coming off the bottom, I love how easy it is to use the dock with the Prime--and it's so thin when they're together! Issues: screen is heavier than the dock. I got a good case and now I don't worry about it at all. Mouse is a little awkward at times, so I usually just use the touch screen (it's funny transitioning back to my regular laptop; I'm always hitting the screen).This thing is so easy to use! The only thing I wish was that the WiFi detector was stronger. If I'm in my backyard, it doesn't pick up the signal; if I am five feet from the door (about 200 feet from the router) I pick it up again.

There seem to be a lot of Primes being shipped with this major issue. :(------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Original review:I've had a chance to play with the Asus Transformer Prime for a few days now, and I'm very impressed. I was going to wait until next week when the Android 4 ICS update comes out, but I decided to give a brief review in it's current stage.First Impressions: Out of the box, the Prime has the look and feel of quality built tablet. The thinness really surprised me since my other tablets are at least twice as thick. Before doing anything, I charged the Prime fully. The first boot took about 90 seconds. My Prime came with firmware .27, which I updated to the latest .33. After updating and getting everything setup, the Prime would boot in under a minute.Screen: Simply put, it's bright and beautiful. I do not have any noticeable light bleeding.Wifi: This is where I was most concerned. My concerns seem to be unfounded. My Wifi works fine. My router (an older FiOS Actiontec \"G\") is located on the 2nd floor. I get a good signal throughout my house, including my basement. Throughput is fine, and my connection never drops.GPS: First let me say that I could care less about this because I'll never use my Prime not connected to Wifi, but for the purposes of this review, I did test it. The first test was indoors, and as expected the results were not good. I could get an occasional satellite lock, but it would disconnect. I then went outside and I made sure Wifi was disabled. With a clear view of the sky, the Prime got a satellite lock in around 30 seconds. The GPS seems to work fairly well if you're outdoors and have a clear view of the sky. It remained locked, and Google Maps knew exactly where I was. Depending on your plans for the GPS, it is a mixed bag. If you're planning on using it for navigation in your vehicle, you'll probably be disappointed. If you want to use it outdoors with apps such as Google Maps, or Google Sky Map, then it works OK.Battery: Battery life was good. My first charge lasted about 8 hours. After some tweaking and subsequent charges, I now get around 10 hours.Cameras: The 8MP rear camera has 1080P video capture and is a great performer. It takes excellent pictures in good light, and is the best I've seen on an Android tablet or phone. I haven't taken much video, but from what I have taken, it looks very good.  The front 1.2MP camera is perfect for video conferencing, etc.Performance: Performance is excellent as expected. The Tegra 3 doesn't disappoint even though most apps aren't optimized for it. All the apps I use open noticeably faster than my Tegra 2 based tablet. The screen is quick and responsive, and I haven't noticed any lag. I use Dolphin HD as my browser, and the stock keyboard. There is the occasional \"app crash\", but this is almost always related to Android 3 \"Honeycomb\", not the Prime's hardware. The vast majority of current apps are written for compatibility with phones and Android 2.x, not the \"tablet only\" Android 3.x. In 2012, Android 4.x \"ICS\" will solve this problem, as the same operating system will once again be used for both new phones and new tablets.Overall: I'm completely satisfied. Wifi was my only real concern, and it works just fine for me. The Asus Transformer Prime looks beautiful, and is blazing fast. My only caveat would be if the GPS is very important to you. Since its limitations appear to be hardware related, I wouldn't expect any major improvements to it.

I preordered my tablet originally on November 22.  I received my tablet from Amazon on January 4th, and found out that the gyroscope and accelerometer didn't work at all.  I called up ASUS, and after a few calls back and forth, they decided that it was indeed broken, and that I had to send it in.  It sucked, but they told me that it would take 7 days to fix once they received it, so I said alright, two weeks at most with shipping time, I can do that.  I sent the tablet back and it arrived at ASUS on January 9th according to USPS tracking.  ASUS's RMA status page didn't say that they had received it, until a week later on the 16th.

In some apps, it just duplicates what is on your screen, in others like BDS player, it goes black and only shows the controls which is nice.My issue is about the inconsistent flash performance on large network sites (NBC, CBS, ABC, etc). Sometimes I can get it to work, some never work, some sometimes work. There was a new flash update so time will tell if this improves. Unlike the iPad, there are no apps that can play shows from these places.***I'm not sure if the GPS and wifi issues are blown out of proportion, if there's user error, if there's a unit to unit variation, or if the later units had a fix, but these 2 features seem to work fine on mine. Instead of focusing on numbers (ie speed/BW), just see if it's able to do the things you want reasonably well compared to similar devices. You don't need a firehose to water a plant or having a supercomputer to write a paper isn't going to get it done any faster. :) Likewise, it's very possible that some of these units are genuinely defective.Lastly, a hint to buy it on amazon (at it's intended price and free shipping) is to add it to your cart and just check it religiously. I saw it become available once (Wed morning) and it was gone in 30 mins. I saw it again Fri night and that's where I snagged it. With prime, I got it on Monday.****2-8-2012 update****There was an update today but I do not know if the following was due to the update or not.I tested my wifi using speedtest.net on my TFP and my wife's IP2. Both had similar wifi results. (make sure you select the same server).I also tested the GPS and was able to get a few satellites on the 2nd floor. On the 3rd (top) floor, I got lots of satellites and and was able to lock.****2-14-2012 update****Using the device to watch TV. NBC not supported. ABC works decent. History Channel works but a bit laggy. Don't have Netflix.****3-22-2012 update****NBC still doesn't work. I think it's because they use Silverlight though I heard they were changing. The APP has little or no content.CBS works.HULU Plus APP installs but video not supported.History Channel more stable now.TED APP works, though a bit buggy.****tips*****I though I'd post some tips I learned here.If you use google accounts (gmail, calendar, google++, ect.), it's pretty to sync it to the Transformer. Simply d/l the app and login. If you want to sync your bookmarks on your PC to the TFP, it takes a little more work. First, you have to d/l the latest Chrome browser. The you have to enable the syncing to google accounts. Then any bookmarks that you add to Chrome show up in the stock browser after a few minutes. If you are not already using Chrome, you can use Chrome to import your bookmarks from other browsers. After that, they will show up on the TFP.If someone sends you an invite from their calendar program (ipad, google calendar) to your gmail account, it appears in your calendar. Makes it easy to sync calendars with other people.Sorry if any of this is basic knowledge, but it took me a while to figure out how to do this.

My wife has an iPad 2 that she also got recently, and while I am impressed by both devices, the Prime has won me over with its insane processor speed and beautiful display. The seamless integration with my google account is also a plus - my apps began downloading right away, and after I logged into my google account, all of my wireless access points were instantly available, so I didn't have to log in to wifi manually once I got home. As for the iPad 2, we had to plug it into the computer to sync for a few hours before getting to use it, and after all that we discovered that our apple accounts had gotten confused, so the iPad had a weird mix of apps from two different accounts, most of which were solely meant for the iPhone, so the screen resolution was off. Surprisingly, the Prime was easier to set up than the iPad 2 (I've usually found apple products to be very intuitive).Another thing that impressed me are the speakers in the Prime. I played some music and it sounded great. The Prime is also thinner than the iPad 2. I believe the processor is faster as well (it sure feels like it).After playing with each, I just feel like there is so much more that I can do with my Prime than with the iPad 2. My apps and games look better on the Prime, even the ones that were designed for phone use. When I am using it, I really get the feeling that Asus went all out to give us the best experience imaginable at this point in technology.

Reis", "ReviewID": "R2M90SZ4YEP9K7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I find the Asus Transformer Prime TF201 (32GB) to be an excellent product for what it was designed to be: A consumer tablet. Note: It is not a notebook or full slate computer. I will provide a review on what I needed a tablet for: an eReader for books and journal article PDFs, a way to do light work (minor document editing and posts to online classrooms) when travelling, surfing the web at home, watching videos, and playing games now and then.Because the tablet has been reviewed fairly extensively, I will just address the highpoints and issues others have experienced. I am running Android version 4.0.3 (ICS) and it is pretty flawless so far (this udpate happened automatically when I first charged the tablet and took about 10 minutes). I don't know or care about the bootloader issue others have reported on. The only thing I noticed is that I cannot delete the stock photos in the gallery.Screen and Resolution - Bright, vivid, awesome HD graphics, and smooth scrolling between panes/screens. No defects in screen or resolution (no light bleed). Glass picks up finger prints but very easy to clean and not really noticable whne screen is on. Gorilla glass seems pretty hard, so hopefully will never scratch with proper care and a case.WiFi - no problems whatsoever. Signal is pretty good several floors from router and has not dropped. My tablet works as well as all my other wireless devices. The signal strength indicator does vary from 10-52 Mbps depending on where you are, but it never has any trouble downloading at regular speeds. My expereince has been that the WiFi on the tablet works fine, but could probably be better for those with weak signals.Browser - The Asus browser works great! Loads as fast as any other WiFi computers on my 54 Mbps wireless(but slightly slower than hard-wired broadband computers, of course). I prefer the functionality of non-Mobile sites for Netflix and Rotten Tomatoes, so glad I can access these sites with a regular browser rather than a stripped-down App. Access is fast and trouble-free to all the major sites I have visited. I have encountered only a very few \"browser not responding\" boxes when loadig large pages, but as soon as you click \"Wait\" the page is immediately loaded and there have been no real \"crashes\" to report.eReader - Using Kindle and MyLibrary apps, books and PDFs open and scroll fine. One exception is that I can't open password-protected PDFs...seems to be a ProQuest ezproxy compatibility issue with Android OS and not the fault of the tablet per se.Apps - Have downloaded about 20 and all seem to work fine. No crashes.Battery life - It goes through about 10% an hour with moderate use and \"balanced mode\" selected. I got 11.5 hours on first full day of usage and still had 10% battery left when I shut down. very hapy with battery life. The keyboard dock battery should extend this to 16 hours - very nice!GPS - Did not buy for this feature, but it works fine with WiFi on or off. Inside or outside of house makes no difference either. Accurate to within 10-15 feet and updates in real time with your movements.I have not yet received the keyboard dock yet, so I can't comment on that, but I hope that it allows for easier full screen viewing while typing. The Asus keyboard works fine for an on-screen keyboard (certainly easier than using the one on my android phone!) and does not have any noticeable lag (but I am not a speed typist by any stretch of the imagination!).One thing I did not anticipate is how hard it is to hold with one hand for extended periods of time. It is not heavy, but it is thin and the back is not textured enough to provide good grip. I have ordered a case that should make one-handed reading easier and also converts for desktop stand use.Overall I feel this is an excellent tablet.", "Date": "January 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Loved it until this: Serial Number \"Unknown\" bug.", "Author": "Louis Steele", "ReviewID": "RY55YTM5HP5LM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I loved my Prime. I didn't have any issue with wifi, and the GPS worked fairly well. I hadn't received any notification for the OTA .29 and .33 updates that came out last week, but didn't think much of it and updated manually off the ASUS website. Last night when the long anticipated Android 4.03 ICS update came out, I didn't get that one either. I went onto XDA this morning, only to find out that there were several threads including one that was 10 pages long, about a nasty bug in which some Primes were shipped without a serial number embedded into the software. Apparently it's a fairly large percentage considering all the people now stuck with no OTA updates. The bottom line is, if you go into: system info > about tablet > and see Serial Number \"Unknown\", you'll never get an OTA update. Not only that, you can't root (if you care), and can't boot into stock recovery either. I'd post the link to XDA, but Amazon will remove it, so either Google it, or head over to the XDA Forums.

Tegra 3 Quad-core processor, IPS+ display, thinner than anything out in the market, and all for $499?  Not to mention that it would be out by November, well before Christmas season.  There really wasn't much reason not to place pre-order.  Then everything fell apart.First ASUS dropped amazon.com out of their pre-order partner, which gave that horrible gut feeling, soon to be followed by massive pre-order cancellation (there are just too many to count on how many were affected by this, including myself).  Outrage of not providing an option to just stay in pre-order were eventually met with an option to re-order this item in late november which were quickly sold out in matter of minutes.  Estimated release date thankfully moved from Valentine's Day (funny joke, if there was one) to mid-January, and eventually received mine few days ago.  By then, I completely gave up on any hope for Christmas delivery, but was hopeful about the rumored Ice Cream Sandwich update (Android 4.0).  To add one more twist to this possibly the most agonizing pre-order SNAFU, amazon.com sent me an email about providing $10 credit as a way of making up for botched pre-order, but even that was delayed, leading me to send an email to their stellar customer service (which I hardly ever have to use) inquiring yet another botched promise (eventually amended).Here comes the whole three days of experience with ASUS Transformer Prime:+Good:Beautiful, expensive looking product: Use of brushed metallic back gives the heft and touch that rhymes with \"I feel expensive, and therefore, I am an expensive product\".Great display*: Bright, outdoor viewable, great color reproduction, no color bending from extreme angle, and no noticeable edge bleeding.Quick Update: Less than 20 minutes after I unpacked this product, I saw update being downloaded, and within an hour, it was updated to ICS.Good software: ICS is truly what Android tablet meant to be.  Smooth transition, more logical arrangement, and ASUS control panel comes very handy.-Bad:GPS Performance, or lack thereof: Even with assistance from Wi-Fi, I can't get a lock at all.Wi-Fi Performance: This is where metallic back rears its ugly head.  Where I normally get 3-4 bars and decent speed, I struggled to get any reception with this tablet.Overall shape/form factor: Not entirely fault of this product, as 10\" can be bit unwieldy on your hands.  I was keep changing from portrait to landscape and could not get comfortable holding either way.  Lessons on actually seeing and testing out the product prior to purchase.-UGLY:Terrible Quality control: As I was looking at it in lighter colored background, I noticed darkened area, about 5 pixels long vertically just to the left of the dead center.  At first, I thought, \"Hmm, smudges.  I better wipe it off\".  Then to my horror, I realized that there were no smudge to wipe off.  It was dreaded dead/stuck pixels.  In darker backgrounds, it is barely noticeable, but as color becomes lighter, it was unmistakable.  It gives that horrible, \"there's popcorn kernel stuck in my teeth and my god, it feels like a boulder\" feeling every time I looked at it.Alas, but there were more issues.  Outer lens cover were discolored, much like someone accidentally scratched off UV coating, and pictures I took had discoloration on corresponding area.Further compounded by lower bottom lip where plastic outer ring connects metal back and front glass display were nicked as well.  I can most certainly understand shortage issue, delay issue and so on (which has become unofficial trademark of HOT and NEW ASUS product launch), but having three glaring quality control issues in one?  No, that won't do.  I cannot imagine any Apple buyers letting this go should these happen to their iPad.  I am not fond of mentioning their products, but I do expect them not letting this many mistakes in a single product to land in retailer.As much as I would love to keep this product, I returned it, pending refund.

My first foray was the Motorola Razr.  Love the phone.  I then decided to give the original ipad to the wife and kids and switch to the Transformer Prime.  After preordering the Prime and matching keyboard dock I watched my email waiting for the shipping notice.  After several weeks both items arrived at my door and I immediately fell in love with the form factor and overall build of the Prime.  I fired up the unit and was amazed at the beauty of the screen.  It just popped with color and clarity.  Unfortunatley the user experience was marred by frequent stutters, freezing and hang-ups.  I initially chalked it up to the honeycomb os and lived with the poor user experience waiting for Ice Cream Sandwich.Asus, true to their word, pushed out ICS shortly after launch of the Prime.  I could not be happier with the new OS, transitions were far nicer and the user experience seemed to be really set up for the tablet experience.  But once again I was sadly mistaken.  The same old problems continued to persist.  For a tablet that boasted a quad core processer and bleeding edge technology, it simply could not transform those specs into a great user experience.  This is where Asus and most other tablet manufacturers using the Android OS have failed.  Specs are only as good as the experience of the end user.  While I am far from an Apple fanboy, I could not ignore the fact that I knew little of the internal specs of their products but was always satisfied when using the product.  I remain hopeful that Asus and Android will figure it out.  But they are a long ways away from getting it together and we as consumers should not be forced to make excuses for what is essentially a subpar user experience.", "Date": "March 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "The last batch of Primes seems to be good!", "Author": "Top_Swatta_Shane", "ReviewID": "R3N6AHNVD4PJD5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought my prime about mid February from Gamestop after weeks and weeks of ever increasing 'In Stock times.' I watched in anticipation as the availability went from 'Coming in February,' to 'February 7,' to February 14,' to February 21.'  Apparently the wait was for good reasons though. I Received my unit with Honeycomb on board, and it was blazing fast out of the box, and then it was immediately updated to ICS and it tasted so much better.PERFORMANCESince day one the Transformer Prime has performed almost flawlessly with very few exceptions. I have had probably about 3 sudden restarts that left me scratching my head, (although I must admit, until reading a few reviews here I had no idea I should be powering down frequently). A few apps have force closed, but I suspect it may have more to do with the actual app than the tablet itself. Other than that, there is not much that seems to slow it down. My son has messed around with a few of the Tegra 3 games in Tegra Zone and they run without a hiccup. I'm still building up my app repertoire so I have yet to find out how well it copes with limited memory.I regularly clear out my running applications tray, but not because the unit is suffering from any related performance issues, but rather because I like things uncluttered. In fact, often times I'm surprised to see just how much crap is running in the background without the unit even flinching. Admittedly though, having had some less than positive experiences on android with the Galaxy S 4gS, I've been waiting for my prime to go haywire, but thankfully it just hasn't come yet.BATTERYBattery life is astounding. I wasn't expecting anything less, based on other reviews, but to be able to experience and confirm this is amazing. It still being a new device in my household, it gets used LITERALLY non-stop for hours on end. We're usually running multiple browsers with multiple tabs (i recently download Chrome beta and am testing it against the stock browser to see which is better), gaming, including light duty Bejeweled along with some pretty taxing tegrazone games, but mostly we're streaming Netflix,  Crackle and Amazon Videos( wish Hulu would hurry up with development of their application). With all this going on non-stop we still pretty much wind up having to charge up not more than once a day. I can't imagine how awesome it would be with the dock which bumps up the battery life to around 16 hours. As a qualifier though, i should say that the screen brightness fluctuates between about 35-60% depending on who is using it.APPSI can't say how well the stock Asus apps perform as I haven't used them very much. I even booted the stock keyboard for GOKeyboard from the GoLauncher folks. It allows split screen typing which vastly improves the usability in landscape mode. I'm typing away right now on it, and I couldn't imagine using the stock keyboard to mash out  this review. I haven't used the Asus Cloud application either as I'm a dropbox user. I have however used the email application, the weather widget and the one touch kill widget. All work very well and their guis seem pretty well designed.WIFI AND GPSIts fitting for these to receive their own categories since so many have had endless problems with the two. I have had no issues whatsoever with wifi. My unit connects very quickly to either of two wireless networks that I have in my house and holds the connection very well. My speeds are not at all diminished from the metal banking. I speed tested the unit and regularly attain speeds of about 8-9 mbps down (my connection speed from the isp is supposed to be 10mbps down). In comparison, my Galaxy S2 gets exactly the same on average, and with the exception of the metal banding around the edge, its all plastic. Web pages load up pretty fast, although they are noticeably slower on chrome, but again that has more to do with the app than the prime. I haven't used GPS so I cannot comment on it's fidelity. I regularly use the GPS on the aforesaid SGS2 which works perfectly well for me, and I don't see a reason now or in the near future I will have to use a giant 10 inch screen in my car for navigation. But to each his own.DESIGNIt is sexxy! Plain and simple. It's ultra thin profile make it extremely portable, its sleek metal backing give it a solid feel without affinity much heft/weight to the unit. The gentle curves improve the ergodynamics and make it very comfortable to use for extended periods. I'm not a fan of the buttons though although I understand how they fit into the overall style and design. I find the slightly difficult to find just by touch, and equally tough to press.I'm also not a huge fan of the headphone placement on the side (if you consider the upright position as having the Asus logo in the top left corner in landscape mode). I feel like it is rife for damage by virtue of it sticking out of the right side in almost exactly the place you would naturally put your right hand when holding it in landscape mode. The speaker is in a worse position. It is directly below said natural position, and without a conscious effort to avoid it, you inevitably will obscure it during normal use. I don't personally  find the volume adequate and i would have much preferred the use of a pair of stereo speakers instead of one mono. Every once in a while I'll find the thin metal sliver above the charging dock bent and I have to straighten it. I suppose it's because it is as thin as it is that this happens. Maybe Asus should consider totally removing this piece or beefing it up in future iterations. I haven't experienced any creaking from screen movements or any backlight bleed.OVERALLI'm pretty happy with my Transformer Prime. In fact I'm in love with it. Steve Jobs was right, it is nothing short of magical (yes I know this is not an iPad). In concrete terms, it is extremely portable, solidly built, incredibly fast, sufficient powerful and is quite simply a joy to use.Update 10/14/12After nearly 8 months of use, I am thoroughly satisfied with the tablet still. Asus has provided a steady and timely stream of updates which have greatly increased the usability of the device. I'm now up to Jelly Bean (Android 4.1) and the unit is still quite speedy in everyday tasks. The GPS and WiFi issues are null and void since about two updates ago, although I have noticed that JB is a bit of a resource hog. There have been VERY MINOR lags here and there, but nothing that would make the Transformer Prime unusable. Lets talk about durability though; in the past eight months, I have shattered the screen once (about a month into my owning of the device) and had to have it replaced by Asus, other than that, it is as pristine as the day I bought it. It stays in a leather case all the time so scratches on the back, or anywhere else for that matter, are non-issues. The battery life is still spectacular. My household is a no TV house, everything is streamed which means our XBOX, PCs, Laptops, Tablets, and phones get used QUITE A LOT, and I only have to charge this thing once a day and we're good to go. That niggling issue i mentioned with the charging area has not gone away. The thin metal strip is severely bent and I suspect it will break any day now. Also, the charging port itself has a plastic retainer for the multiple pins on the charging port - a portion of it has since broken off leaving the pins hanging in mid air. I'll probably have to send it in for repairs shortly before the pins break off completely. By the way, the repair process was smooth,I called and received an rma, shipped the device out, they checked the damage and gave an estimate (I broke the screen), I paid, they fixed and shipped the thing back to me. The whole process took a few weeks. Not bad considering that there's no Asus store down the road I can take my device to.Anyways, Happy Tablet Hunting!", "Date": "March 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "A good blend...", "Author": "Business Owner", "ReviewID": "R29V2VPWF18IGX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As a business owner who desires to give as good customer service when mobile to clients as when at the office, this unit can deliver.

We found many of the tablets to not be very impressive on WiFi. And depending (It seems) on if you are getting an old stock or a new one (Has 4.0 already installed) it seems you may have one with a bad transmitter/receiver or something. I think until you own them all and use them in your own environment it is hard to know if one is actually better than another. We are very pleased with ours having tested many of them in the store.

I search several forums and apparently, it just happens and you just have to RMA it if the suggested fixes dont work for you. With warranty, its ok. i kept my cool.

Even if it stutters and freezes a few times.  But hmmmmm...i paid $600 for this?!? After that trip to RMA and back, it seems to be working ok again. Then the dreaded thing...screen went blank. Dead. Charged and recharged. Again searched the forums for help. None of the suggestions worked for me. Asus? hmmmm...standard answer. RMA it. But my warranty is over. Cost? Dont ask...its ridiculously high for something they know wasnt done well. Did i handle my ASUS well? Yes i did, ma'am/sir! Screen + whole body shielded with Skinomi, including my keyboard. Then it is housed in a leather case, coz thats how protective i am. No kid allowed to touch this. Adult friends, ok but with supervision. ;-p Use it mostly for, reading e-books and news, movies, skype, email, twitter, facebook, light games. No ridiculous amount of apps. I dont try apps that are new. IF it was working, it was great. But i did not buy ASUS for that \"IF\" factor. The improvements i was hoping for back then...didnt happen.

A few hiccups thats why i gave it only  4 stars. Hopefully Asus will keep working on improving the tablet. As it is, its amazing! But it still has room to grow which is good as this tablet will not grow old too fast ;-pIts so beautiful! is my first impression upon unboxing. Super fast and efficient in syncing everything from my Droid2 phone and updating firmware and everything else. In a flash, its ready to be customized to my heart's desire. I thought i would have to wait next day! i barely waited 10 minutes, it was that blazing fast! I got it with 28% battery still on it so it didnt take me 8 hours to get it to full 100%. It got charged fast!GPS - first try, believe it or not, spot on. Not 10 or 200 meters away but on target. It even got my favorite spots data on it. And wifi bars is just two when i tried GPS just coz i was curious. GPS isnt important to me for my tablet, im fine with using my droid2 for gps needs.Wifi - this is where the hiccup is. Before i was prompted for firmware update and syncing, i managed to play around with honeycomb for a wee bit and wifi i must say isnt bad. Its fast. a bit laggy in browsing the web but after installing adobe flash. It was fine.  But when i updated to ICS...whoa! i had a hard time connecting with our wifi when i went into my bedroom.  Our router was on the second floor and there's lots of walls and doors... But i thought of going downstairs to see if i can fix it by shortening the range and rebooting my prime while down there.  And the wifi indicator went up to full bars in a blink! Out of a whim i decided to go back upstairs and wifi went down to 3...sometimes 2, but this time around, for some reason, performance wasnt affected. I can download, surf, chat, watch a movie, whatever and no hiccups or disconnection at all. It has stayed connected eversince :-)  Obviously this is where ASUS need more improvement. But no matter, the web browsing and downloading is awesome on ICS despite the 2-3 bars of my wifi range indicator. It is fast. And no, i dont have an N router. And at 2 bars, i can watch netflix without buffering or stuttering. It was smooth till the very end.Love that it has hardly any bloatware... love the Mybooks as you can shift from reading your ebooks to having it read to you by the app by just touching the mic icon.  Love that you can make notes on any page you want, bookmark it and you can turn the page just like a real book. Its lovely!Havent tried the mycloud and the other apps and i am glad i can uninstall any app that has been pre-installed.Apps - the store need improvement and some apps on my droid that got synced need updating to adjust to tablet size. Half of my apps have adjusted already prior to my purchase. And it does need to be categorized better and give tablet owners an idea which apps are ONLY for phones and which ones can be used by both or just by tablets.  I am sure this will be addressed in the near future...am not really nitpicking much on apps coz i am fine with what i've got for now.I dont know if i misread or misunderstood that they have pre-installed games in the Prime...but i didnt see any. Not even a demo copy. In any case, i was able to download an RPG game for free on the TegraZone. But am still curious about the pre-installed games thats suppose to be in the Prime. Oh well...Battery life is great! At one point i was notified that i have only 15% battery life left...i decided to ignore and continue playing. It still lasted me an hour and no lags or freezing.  Last 3%, i was still playing as normally as i did earlier. I'm impressed i can still do a lot! I was playing word with friends and twittering and downloading something.I love the feel of the tablet in my hand, just didnt appreciate seeing fingerprint on the screen but then which tablet doesnt suffer from this? Box came with a cloth to help you clean the screen. Love the vividness of the graphics. Love that i can control the brightness of the screen and that i could easily close down apps by swiping them. I've even learned to use my thumb to do it!I like the sensor that adjusts your screen brightness according to the lighting in your surrounding...great job on this one!Camera is cool...features that go with it to make capturing photos a lot more fun. It is able to handle low light. Still you must understand this is not at par with a regular camera. Its okay. Not gonna nitpick on the video too...i am just glad its available if and when i do need to use one for some reason.I appreciate the Polaris Office, its a smart move of ASUS to include that! works well with having a docking station.No i didnt notice any bleeding on my ASUS and sound was good...was not expecting surround sound but i was surprised at how good it sound. Yes i tried covering the speaker with my hand and it wasnt that bad as others put it. And it is not something that you would tend to cover all the time. I dont so i dont have that much of a problem with the sound. Besides i do use headsets if i want to have good quality sound ;-pHope i covered it all...all i know is i am happy with my Prime.

While I was opening the box I had all these bad Amazon reviews screaming in my head as I steeled myself for yet another big technology let-down (I'd like to mention that I completely ignored all the \"locked bootloader\" reviews.)After I un-boxed and un-wrapped this stunningly gorgeous tablet which my iPad 2-owning wife characterized as \"wow that's sexy\", I immediately plugged it in so I could turn it on right away and skip the 8-hour recommended initial charge. Not thinking ahead, I did this on the kitchen counter, so I stood there for the next hour and played with it while she made supper. The first 15 minutes were great as I tried to convince myself that the fluctuating wifi signal was no big deal, there was a toaster between me and the router after all. I marvelled at the screen most, its quite breathtaking and just as bright and sharp as the iPad's.Then it slowed down. The browser wasn't quick to begin with and as I jumped in and out of more and more apps it was getting noticeably slower, it began to feel just like my DroidX. That is to say that it works, but its much better to have your socks blown off while you use cool tech stuff. We all know that feeling, that's why we're here. But my mood sank, I bought another tech toy that was \"almost\" as good as it was before I got it, almost lived up to the hype and the promotion. That sucks man.Then a firmware update came and I thought, \"no way can this be ICS.\" And it wasn't, and the tablet was no better off. Then a firmware update came for the camera... big deal. Then, after another firmware update started, I began to get excited because it was taking so long. It must be big and big is good in this case. I bet I turned to my wife 20 times and said \"no way ice cream sandwich comes out three days early does it?\" For some reason I thought it was coming on or after the 12th. Finally I jumped on her iPad 2 and Googled and saw an announcement that it was indeed out.Now I was jazzed. I mean, wasn't ICS supposed to be the key that unlocked this beast anyway? Wasn't it the final, huge piece of this puzzle? Well let me tell you something: it was. My DroidX can't stay connected to the house wifi out in the garage reliably, my Prime now maintains 25-30% out there. And inside? Its perfect all over the place, toaster or not.Its twice as fast as when I took it out of the box and I even went back to the stock browser, its quite snappy. Also, I was flying around the Market literally as fast as my fingers could go. There is NO delay on anything in this tablet. It downloads as fast as the internet will allow and it installs apps in the blink of an eye. Everything feels instant and my socks are blown off. This is the tablet I was hoping for when I clicked Submit those long two months ago. It really is...now. I don't like putting it down, I sit and think up things to do with it or just random stuff I want to Google. StumbleUpon is so fast on this thing! I love it.I can't comment on audio or GPS as those are two things I don't care about in a tablet. Although my Acer Iconia puts out some really good sound.

Thank you best buy!  My wife loves tech stuff as much as I do, and we both love the Prime.  We ordered Kindle Fires for the kids, and I got a Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus because I wanted a smaller Tab, but as far as 10\" Tabs go, the Asus Transformer Prime is the best.I would have bought it just for the build alone.  It is quite amazing how this thing looks and feels in your hands.  It is amazingly light and thin yet feels rock solid.  The location of the on/off switch on the top and the volume rocker on the side (landscape) is perfect also.  Other Tabs with plastic backs tend to feel too flexible and dent/scratch rather easily.  The metal iPad is nice, but the iPad just doesn't feel right in my hands compared to the Prime.The screen is bright, colors are rich and deep, viewing angle is GREAT, and it's HD all the way.  Pics online don't do it justice at all.  You really have to feel it and see it in person to really appreciate it.  The Galaxy Tab is the only thing that comes close.Of course, the Tegra 3 chip is one of the things that makes this Tab special and it does not disappoint.  Page transitions are ultra smooth and gaming is glitch free and visually second to none in the Tab world.  This is where Apple has always had an edge on Android, but no more.  Web browsing is very fast, but no better than my Samsung.  This is not due to the Prime, but rather to Honeycomb.  ICS should speed up all Tabs in about amonth from now.The Prime has one of the loudest speakers I've heard and it sounds pretty good too.  It's a little unusual to have only one speaker on the back instead of two on the sides these days, but it doesn't pose a real problem although it is possible to cover the speaker with your hand while holding.  Most of the time I'm having to turn it down!I read that the camera was good, but it really blew me away to see the quality of pics this thing can produce.  It is as good as my 8MP Sony even in relatively low light indoor shots.  I was VERY impressed.  The front facing camera is average.Two basic problems seemed to occur in some pre-release Primes which were sent out for Tech review: WiFi weakness and missed touchscreen ques.  We have experienced neither problem.  Touch sensitivity seems about right for us and WiFi connectivity is good, although my Samsung does seem a little stronger.  Again, NO PROBLEMS with our unit.We are VERY pleased with the Prime.  It was a Christmas highlight to watch my 70 year old Mom race her jet ski in Riptide.

Here is my story:After first few weeks of receiving the product I was very satisfied. So I gave this product 5 star review. However slowly after few months I started having issue with wifi connection..very poor signal receiving power. However it was still working. Around few more months later I saw the battery is not charging any more. I thought it was issue with power cable and ordered new one from Amazon again. However no luck..its still not charging..So I contacted ASUS RMA and send them product to repair as it was under warranty. trust me you will never find such a poor customer service ever in US. They will keep in line for a long time and ask repeated a lot question in the name of security. Total nonsense. Even credit card activation I never asked this much security question. Any way after few days they showed in web site that it was customer induced error though there was nothing wrong I did. I really fight back on that and also called around 50 times their service center as $499 is lot to me and I just cannot waste that. One day they kept in phone waiting for three hours (from one representative to another to supervisor). This drama continued for a month. At last they repaired it without any cost and send like new a ASUS tablet. I was very happy seeing my continued effort with their customer care paid off. However a junk product is always junk...two days back I see it is again the same story..its not charging and this time I really do not have that enthusiasm to deal crappy ASUS customer service. All, please avoid this brand..they will sell in cheap price with high spec product..however parts just carp..it will not hold good for long time.

Simmonds", "ReviewID": "R2EIQR2WRTY0R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Initially, I was somewhat wary of Android but after weeks of research I decided to buy this tablet. It came with ICS  - Android 4.0x, 32 GB version. I won't boar you with the beauty and aesthetics of the unit - it lives up to all of that. The speed of the tablet is unreal (Tegra 3 - 4/5 cores). It is so fast to respond to screen touch - no lag.  I have not experienced any issues with the wireless network coverage that seemed to plague some of the earlier units - so these later units seem to have addressed the issue. There is a massive amount of applications available.  I would recommend buying a stylus - just saves the screen smudging and makes selecting small text easier than using fat fingers.  Here is what amazed me :  I switched it on, fiddled around with some of the features and looked at \"Mynet\".  It discovered all my DLNA devices - like the Windows media server and my Bluray players.  So I picked a movie clip from the server and when I went to play it the TF201 asked if I wanted to display it locally (on the tablet) or on my Bluray player. I selected the Bluray player and the TV burst into life.  It's awesome!Why I like it more than the iPad.  Like the iPad it's aimed at end users / the consumer market - but the TF201 can be extensively customized. The cameras are great - just dragging the focus area around is so cool. Movie playback is crisp and clear. Screen handling is fast and responsive and zooming in is just the usual process of pushing fingers apart. I had preconceived ideas that I would not want to use it like regular PC - but I have been using it like a tablet - and for everything else I would use a PC for - including video conferencing on Skype.  If you want to type long winded reviews then yes, use a PC or get the fabulous docking station (just ordered it). It folds flat, extends battery life to 18 hours, has 2 USB slots and a standard sized SD card.Although the 700 model is due out with it's incredible higher res screen sometime (higher res than the iPad HD)in 2Q you won't be disappointed with the TF201 which already has a beautiful screen.Eco-System : iPad has a much bigger after market for accessories in retail stores. Having one current model makes it easier to produce standard sized accessories. You may struggle to find accessories for Android tablets in retail stores because each device has front / back cameras, memory slots, connection ports, etc in different locations - so cases in general are device specific. However, there is a wealth of accessories for the myriad of Android tablets like this Asus tab on-line.In summary - Android is so user friendly, rock solid and flexible.  The Asus' power and performance makes it a winning combination.  I have bags under my eyes  - staying up so late - I can't leave the Asus alone!Update July 3.

I was super excited but honestly really nervous from all the hate this tablet has been getting on xda.  Regardless i decided to take a risk and get this, since I had been eyeing the original transformer since its launch last year.Pros:1) Form factor: This thing is SEXY, and I wanted the champagne but I have no complaints baout the gray.  It is light and thin but very comfortable to hold and very solid feeling.2) Display: Man this thing has a great, vibrant bright display. my unit had really minor light bleed, barely noticeable and only in the boot screen.3) Performance/Graphics.  Comes preloaded with Glowball and Riptide GP demo, I definately showed it off to my partner who was very impressed. I played around with Android 3.2.1 for 2 hours just so I could experience the difference bewteen ICS and HC. Then I upgraded to ICS...wow this thing got smooth, it was already mostly smooth before but the browser was a night and day difference and the keyboard with swype is nice.Cons:Only have one right now and its Asus'big problem with the TFP..Wi-fi and GPS.  I don't care about the GPS but I was really sad to see that my unit didn't even find a satelite let alone lock onto one and Wi-fi was on... :(.  I could live with that really, even though it is advertised on the box (deducted 1/2 star)What really ruined my day was when I went downstairs with my TFP. I was super happy with it when I was laying on my bed upstairs which is maybe 8ft from the router. As soon as I went into my dining room and walked into my kitchen (20ft from router), the signalwentfrom 4/4 bars to 2/4.  I HAVE A BRAND NEW ROUTER that is top of the line...the good news is that when I went to the basement (30ft) it stayed at 2/4 bars.  I could still stream HQ videos at this signal strength but my iPhone and my partner's Atrix both register full wi-fi signals. (-1/2 star)At this point my enthusiasm is more tamed, I am already loving this device but the Wi-fi may be a dealbreaker.  Perhaps I have a defective unit...regardless I plan on taking this to my university and testing how well it mages the wifi there and will go around town to various starbucks to test too.  If it turns out to manage well I plan on keeping this device and upgrading to the TF700T in 6 mos, if not I will RMA/exchange and try one more before I give up and try a different device.  the problem is there really is no device on par with this on specs as of now... Asus really has something hereUPDATE 1/21: I ended up downloading the speedtest.net app on my TFP , my iPhone 4,  my laptop and my friend`s Atrix. My TFP outperformed my iPhone and Atrix at all three locations in the house sometimes by a lot...it was comparable to my laptop, but a little worse.  This morning I tried the test from the first comment below and got similar results, even in the basement at its farthest from the router the signal showed as excellent. I will test this out at my university and other places and if this stays consistent i willdefinitely keep this so far I am happy!Oh and GPS randomly started to work as well... still not too good but it catches 6 to 8 satellites and looks on 5 to 6with WiFi on,i found when WiFi is off i get the same amount in sight but it doesn't luck on it locked onto 4 satellites twice but only for a few seconds.In response to the second comment I find my TFP to be really fast and smooth like my iphone 4 but I have noticed a glitch once and in certain apps it gets laggy....overall im happy with it since I am not the biggest fan of Apples tactics eitherUPDATE 2:The Asus Mycloud app is amazing i can access my laptop remotely while on my tab which means access to all my files and to Microsoft Word! It also works very smooth without any hiccups. Also the webstorage app is cool i out music on it and can access it on my pad...this thing keeps getting better.UPDATE: Just got my keyboard dock today and I love my Prime it is perfect besides the GPS which functions but barely..I LOVE the keyboard dock :) I've tested WiFi ins several areas and it works perfectly :)", "Date": "January 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Simply put, the best of the best.", "Author": "USAF SF", "ReviewID": "RC77QCATZASUF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have used multiple tablets in the past but have never owned one until now.

I actually purchased mine from Gamestop because it was a package deal that included 5 games and a gamepad, but thought I would review here because I purchased accesories from Amazon...It is a huge fingerprint magnet, but my recent purchase of the Skinomi screen protector (dock compatible) has solved that issue. Additionally because of the width (or lack thereof) I would strongly suggest a protective case, I purchased the Poetic 2-in-1 lightweight case which adds a minimal amount of width to the tablet; most importantly it fits perfectly under any circumstance.One thing, not really a con just something to keep in mind is that it's so much smaller than I had originally pictured and it takes some getting used to using a slightly cramped keyboard. However the placment of hotkeys on the dock are extremely helpful/useful.At any rate, if you pride yourself in being a well informed consumer (as in you spend hours researching before making an actual purchase) and you are on this page considering this purchase, DO IT!

Trust me when I say it wasn't easy but it was worth the trouble. This tablet is by far the most advanced and fastest tablet on the market (IOS or Android). That doesn't mean it's perfect because no tech product is. Those out there looking for a device that never has bugs or issues might as well stop now because you'll never find something to your liking. What I can say is that ASUS did a fine job with putting this together. I won't touch on every aspect of the Transformer Prime but here are some highlights:Screen- This screen is bright and beautiful. You can set the Super IPS display if you're outdoors but otherwise, the regular brightness is perfectly fine. The resolution is the same as most 10.1 inch tablets and is crisp and clear.Speed- This tablet has a Tegra 3 quad-core processor and it is blazing. You can multi-task to your hearts delight and it won't skip a beat. It opens applications faster than any phone or tablet I can think of. The encouraging news is that they are still really developing apps for the Tegra 3 so when that becomes more relevant this thing will be even better. Scrolling and touch sensitivity is \"buttery\" smooth with no lag whatsoever.Build- This is a very aesthetically pleasing device. What I mean is that it is an eye-catcher. Brushed aluminum backing and super thin, it looks fantastic. It's light and the weight balance is perfect when holding with one hand or two. Gorilla glass screen means that you won't have to worry about scratches. Those out there that complain about fingerprints need to realize that this is the case for 99% of tablets out there. (HINT: use the microfiber cloth that comes with it)Storage and Connectivity- One of the biggest selling points was the storage space. 32gb of onboard memory PLUS it has a micro-sd card slot for expansion. This thing can become an entertainment powerhouse.  It has a micro-hdmi out so you can connect to TVs or projectors. This means you can watch Netflix and other movies on a bigger screen if you'd prefer. You won't have to buy a proprietary cables just to connect. Of course, the big sell is the laptop dock accessory. I personally don't need it but its a great option if you want a netbook like experience. Oh yeah, you can also use PS3 or USB gaming controllers with this to play games!Battery Life- So I haven't done an \"official\" battery test but in my usage so far I easily get a couple days out of this tablet. It obviously depends on what the settings are (i.e. screen brightness, power mode) but trust me when I say that if you go on a long trip with this thing you'll be good to go with juice to spare.Ice Cream Sandwich- This may not matter in a month or two but it is currently one of a select few devices that has the latest operating system of Android 4.0, Ice Cream Sandwich. I won't get into all the details of what ICS is but I can say that it is user friendly and has loads of potential.Side notes:Ok, so a lot of people may have heard about certain users having issues with WIFI and/or GPS. On my end, I haven't had a single issue with WIFI. The signal is always strong even at a good distance away from the router. I think this just may be an isolated issue with some of the devices. I don't think this is indicative of all the tablets. I haven't used the GPS much but I can guess that the all-aluminum backing has something to do with the issues its having catching signals from satellites. Honestly though, it's ridiculous to use this as a standalone GPS device.As a heads-up, this tablet is currently (as of 2/21) extremely hard to come by. It is sold out at most, if not all retailers. I'm sure ASUS will eventually be able to keep up with demand but be warned that you may not be able to get one for a while. This obviously is a result of the shortsightedness of ASUS and should bear no negative reflection on the tablet itself.The Verdict:So is this worth $499.99 of your hard earned money?

I do have big hands and am still getting used to typing on the dock but I can peck at the chicklet keys well enough for now.I have already installed several great apps, one of which is letting me play my old Playstation games that I still have lying around and that is awesome - especially with my PS3 joystick automatically recognized.The camera quality is quite noticeable. Much better than any previous tablet/phone I've seen but admittedly I don't see myself using that much other than for Augmented Reality games/etc.Responsiveness, usability, etc is exactly what I was expecting. I am not disappointed in the least with the quality of this tablet.Wi-Fi: I have seen the bars go up and down more than I would like but not much more than my old laptop and I have not dropped any connections at all so while this could improve it is definitely not as bad as some reviews I have read.

It worked well enough for that but did have quite a few issues even doing just that, which was the primary reason for me to buy a tablet. There were 2 main issues that plagued me with this tablet.1) It would shut off sometimes randomly. This led to a large file transfer failing at some unknown time during the night. You see, we would shoot pics all day in Hawaii or wherever we were and then at night I'd pop the SD card in, start up my ftp software and transfer all files from that day. Some nights it would transfer them all with no problems but some nights it would randomly reboot leading to frustration that our nightly backup did not run.2)Wi-Fi reception. My Wi-Fi reception at home was great so I didn't notice anything when I first bought this tablet. I did see many other complaints about it so I was a bit concerned but had no real way to test. Well, eventually I found myself in a hotel room in Utah trying to use the hotel wi-fi and, of course, that is when I realized just how bad it was if you weren't close to the router. Despite my phone getting a full signal, the TF-201 just would not connect and if it did it was only if I stood at the friggin' doorway to the room. It was basically a paper weight on that trip with the exception of the music and movies I had on it. But no web browsing or checking email from it or using the keyboard to type on it, which is why I brought it versus just using my phone.I was able to live with most of this though and trudged along until Asus released the last update. That was when this became a brick to me as far as I was concerned. Ever since that last update the tablet has been sloooow and just plain crappy to use. I could have gone to the trouble of reinstalling everything or going to a custom rom or something but enough already. Time to look elsewhere for me!So as of this writing I have taken advantage of Amazon's trade-in program and I have never looked back. Thanks Amazon for bailing me out of this one!Changed my stars down to 2. Asus really should have done something for owners of this tablet between the GPS and the wi-fi issues. I did get a free GPS dongle. Sold it on ebay for $10. I also got $17 from a class action lawsuit. $27 towards a new tablet and NOT another product from Asus ever again. Hope it was worth it Asus because I doubt I am the first nor the last to swear your products off after this fiasco.", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "I am in Love!", "Author": "Jason C.

My wife has an Ipad and I've used it to but not much. It works the same as an ipod touch so this all relates. Using an itouch, if you will, at least without an app you can't hide apps, edit music or video files, have flash support for webpages or just browse files. All of which you can do with my Android operated ASUS Transformer! It's little things like that that make me love this thing. What else do I love? Um...the resolution. Having a Tegre 3 processor, you can watch some very high definition movies on it. I have a bluray ripped Avatar movie that looks so damn clear I swear it looks like bluray on my tablet. I don't know if it's just as good but I do know it sure is pretty. Already I've downloaded over 200 apps on this thing and if I don't have the live wallpaper running and I don't have more than 10 apps running at a time, this guy runs smooth as butter. Don't get me started on the Live Wallpaper. If you want to impress your friends real quick, download Koi Live Wallpaper. While on the home screen you can see very realistic fish swimming in water under your icons while rain drips in the water and watch your friends jaws drop when the fishes swim away from your finger when you touch the screen. (You're welcome Kittehface Software for the plug ) Before buying this thing the only problem I've seen people having with it is it's wifi speed. I'm not a real big technical nerd and the wifi I have available where I'm at sucks as it is so I can't really say much about it other than it works good enough for me. Some might not realize this but if you get the keyboard docking station, there's a USB slot on the docking station so that you can hook up your external hard drive to it and an XBOX controller for a lot of games that support it. NOW! for my most beloved feature/ability of this thing. The ability to download and play SNES, N64 and Playstation games through emulators available on the Android Market aka Google Play. I don't know about getting roms from the apps because I've always had the roms on my hard drive but the emulators all work well with a controller. I really liked my ipod touches a lot but I love this thing so much I would marry it if I could and if I was single. I do love my wife a lot more though.", "Date": "April 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Bluetooth Fail", "Author": "Puneet Arora", "ReviewID": "R1EH2HVQZUSEAR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got my TF Prime about a week and half ago. It made a very good first impression on me - Just loved it's sleek design and smooth ICS UI ! The speaker failed to impress me though.There seems to be only 1 so it's mono sound. It's also towards one side of the tablet which makes it sound even horrible. Moreover the volume is too low too. Though if that was the only problem I'd still rate this tablet 4/5. However there's more annoyance that comes with this tablet. Since the speaker sound is low I recently tried using a bluetooth headset with it. With the bluetooth headset connected the internet speed falls drastically - in my case from a good 10mpbs to 1.5mbps (measured using Speedtest.net). I can then barely stream good quality videos, Netflix streams constantly stop and go into \"buffering\". Same is true about Youtube. As soon as I disconnect my bluetooth headset the speed is back.I can also not use my bluetooth headset for any kind of communication. Both in GTalk and Skype no audio can be heard on the headset. Gtalk gives you an option where you can use bluetooth for communication, but if you do, nothing is audible at all. And Skype audio just skips the headset and comes through the speaker. So basically the speaker volume is low and you can't even use a bluetooth headset so if say the surroundings are even slightly noisy (say a running fan) you feel pretty helpless. This is a major drawback as far as communication using this device goes. I will thus give it a well deserved 1/5. It's got potential to be a great device but this major communication related drawback badly kills it.Oh and the Netflix App is horrible to scroll .. it's like a rusted wheel. Putting the device in performance mode barely helps it. Not rating the device on this point though, just saying.PS: I'm running the latest firmware as of today - 9.4.2.15, with Android 4.0.3 (that's ICS)", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perfect", "Author": "Transfer998", "ReviewID": "R1H48JTS4QU97P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off if you want to buy one DO NOT PAY MORE THAN 499.99 for 32Gb. I bought mine from GameStop because people were selling theirs on here with jacked up prices. The MSRP is 499.99 and 599.99 for the 32Gb and 64Gb respectively, and the docks are 149.99.  If you go on ASUS's store and look at the accessories that will give you the max you should pay for them.  Anyways, this tablet is top of the line end of story. The quad core Tegra 3 gives great performance and great battery life.  The tablet can output thru the micro-HDMI port full 1080p and 3D for certain games, tested the 3D on my friends TV and no hiccups or performance issues.  The screen is amazing also the IPS+ will be great for those summer days when im working on my projects outside, I have done some rough simulations indoors but I cant wait to see how it does in the noon sun of the Midwest.  Size wise it is thin and light, physically thinner and lighter than the iPad 2 but trust me you wont notice. The camera's are good don't expect professional quality but they can hold there own with any tablet on the market.  The battery life is great I squeezed out 16 hrs today (no WiFi, Bluetooth, no back-light and on power saver mode) but on the average i get 11-13 hrs, about 7-8 hrs when im playing games that use the full potential of the Nvidia Tegra 3.  Overall this is the best tablet I have tested, i loved it so much I bought one even tho ASUS is coming out with a revision in about 3-6 months (ASUS Transformer TF700)that has a full 1080p display.  Honestly I don't need a 1080p display on my tablet a) all my stuff on my computer is 720p which works fine with the Prime's display b) you're not going to notice much difference on a 10.1\" display other than 1080p files are going to be larger and c) its 100$ more.Overall great product. the only con i have about it is that amazon(us) didn't sell it, only amazon Canada did, and no I am not going to count the people or companies selling the prime thru amazon since they are not ASUS registered sellers.Update 1 year later with JB (4.1 waiting on 4.2):still the best tablet on the market in my opinion sure you don't have the stylus oops I mean S-pen as the notes but the killer feature is its keyboard dock, I average about 18-20 hrs running videos and over 20 doing simple tasks. the only down side is its wifi but its not as bad as people make it out to be.  Sure its not as sensitive as the newer ones but really there's not much difference, all the area's that are dead with my prime is dead with my friends infinity and speeds are comparable ~2%. ASUS has really worked hard on making the wifi and the GPS better and they have improved greatly since day 1.  Overall performance is still great even tho there are newer and shinier tablets, but the tegra 3 is showing its age with the tegra 4 coming soon, can you say xbox 360/PS3 graphics on a tablet?  finally I have read people complaining that the graphics look no different than on their phone, all I have to say is look for games labeled \"THD\" (tegra HD) they bring out the most of a tegra device, standard games like \"where's my perry\" or \"shadowgun\" are designed for all android systems but \"ShadowGun THD\" is going to be better since it was developed with the tegra in mind.  Just because you put an ps1 game in a ps3, doesnet make the game have ps3 graphics and physics, same applies for apps.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great ICS Tablet; Incredible

I was a little worried when purchasing the tablet but I've come to find out that the best way to figure it out is to buy it yourself.  I'm a simple person who uses this for surfing the web, reading, YouTube and some games.  For all of these things this tab works great and I have no problems what so ever.  My wi-fi works just fine, even after going to the ground level of my apartment, yes the signal drops a bar or two but surfing the web is still fast.  The screen on this thing is amazing, I read comics all day at work and the 16:9 ratio really works for me, a lot better than an Ipad which is what the girlfriend has.  Having a total of 5 processers really helps this thing blaze thru all the window screens and the flash content for the websites I go on which is great.  I've only had one crash and I've had the prime for about three weeks.  ICS is great and ASUS seems to be pushing firmware almost every other week.  I guess my only problem with this thing is that ASUS calls purple tint gray...It's really no big deal because I have a case for it but I really wish it was a gray not a purplish gray. Also remember to charge the battery a full 8 hours before use,  my lord was that a hard thing to do but now I go about two and a half days on the battery and I use this thing all day at work doing some reading, watching videos and surfing the web and then I go home and do the same thing.In short I really do think that if your interested in this tablet then go for it.  Amazon has a 30 day return policy and the fact that I didn't pay taxes for this made me get 2 day shipping.  I paid $511 on Amazon with two day shipping rather than going to a Best Buy and spending $535 after tax.  I would've gotten next day for $521 but I wouldn't have been home when the tablet was delivered.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Super Tablet", "Author": "Ram-Z", "ReviewID": "R2TUHANES2X321", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "*******01/28/2012 update*******I have been getting 10 to 11 hours out of mixed usage, wifi on for about three hours a day, some simple gaming and lots of reading (nook) and showing folks photos of my trip to Germany two weeks ago.Performance is very good, even though i am using balanced mode.  Wifi works pretty well when within 100 feet of the router.Universal acclaim about the qualityof the images.  I used a Kodak 10 megapixel digital camera on my Germany trip and the photos POP when looking at them.The weakest thing i see is not the hardwarebut the software available to theandroid universe but that will improveover time.  Take the plunge!**************I purchased this tablet elsewhere due to the excessive pricing on Amazon for this tablet.  I got it at MSRP of $499 + state Tax and Free shipping at an office supply vendor.  But I am an Amazon fan for most purchases.Appearance:  Very sleek design.  Thin but a good, solid feel to it. I have the gray brushed aluminum back and it is very attractive.  I had purchased and returned a TF101 and this back looks better.  Buttons in a good spot ergonomically for volume and power on/power off.  MicroSD card sticks out slightly when inserted but unless you press pretty hard, it is not going to pop out on you.Comfort:  This tablet is comfortable to hold in one hand, though when reading my ebooks, I seem to use two hands more unconsciously.  That is not a demerit on the tablet.Weight:  Not too heavy, more than my Nook but expected for the size.PerformanceWireless - Device came with Gingerbread and my Wi-Fi seemed to be a bit less effective than the wi-fi on my smartphone (HTC Thunderbolt).  Upgraded to Ice Cream last night and when using Wi-Fi at the same location today, it seemed to perform better.  no formal testing, just pulling up web pages and such as well as maintaining connectivity.Display:  Very crisp and clear.  Nice range in adjusting brightness.  Movie play back when watching MP4's is good.  Had issues playing WMV files though, even when downloading different apps to play (MOBO was one).  Very quick switching between photo's in the Gallery.  Note on the Gallery, a very good basic photo editor and viewer.  Full screen shots move quickly and the Transformer quickly brings the next shot up and in focus.  Easy to maneuver around in, even though I really don't do much with that type of software.  No issues with screen changing colors due to pressure on the corners like some have mentions.Battery Life:  Pending a good test of the battery but when I use the Wi-Fi and am in constant action, I get about five hours out of it. (estimated).  I will try various settings out and some of the battery saver Apps like I use for my cell phone to see how well I can extend that.  Literature says about 9.5 hours but I don't know the metrics behind that and I do use the wireless a lot in my initial couple of days with the device.Software suiteEmail:  Software works pretty well. Have 2 POP accounts and 3 IMAP accounts going and no issues with it.  Video Play won't play WMV files and I'm still searching for a player that will work with. I'd recommend downloading a more versatile player.Browser:  I like the stock browser better than the Firefox Mobile version I downloaded and then removed.  For what I use it for, it meets my needs.Photo Gallery:  works well in displaying photo's, slide shows and basic editing.Polaris Office:  have not used it yet. I'll hopefully have more information on the updated version.Unit is upgradeable to Ice Cream which took about 15 minutes of downloading and installing.  This included an updated Wi-Fi Driver if I remember correctly.Initial Conclusion:This is my first tablet.  I got it because while I love my HTC Thunderbolt, I really enjoy some screen size and I like android vs IOS.  I did not want to be limited to proprietary APP stores which is why I did not go with the cheaper seven inch models that were the rage over the Christmas shopping season.This is a QUAD core unit with excellent performance so far.  Plenty of storage and a MicroSD slot so no issues on capacity.  I have not experienced the issues with Wi-FI or GPS (did not get it for GPS so don't care about that)so I am satisfied thus far.  The T700 is coming out but other than supposed better wifi/gps performance and a slightly better webcam, I could not see a reason to wait three more months and spend another $100.00.

Williams \"Brian Patrick Williams\"", "ReviewID": "R24IQ5W5VHT48D", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Just opened and played with it today.  The Wi-Fi worked great when right next to the Wireless Router.  However, when I walked just 10 feet away, the signal strength dropped and the speed decreased by 75%.  When compared to my Macbook Pro and HTC Incredible 1, the Wi-Fi connectivity on the Prime lacked BIG TIME.  And don't get me started on the GPS.  I couldn't even get a signal...  Yes, some people love their Primes.  However, A LOT of people have severely MIXED FEELINGS about theirs.  And the mixed feelings ALL have to do with the Wi-Fi/GPS/BT connectivity.  From what I gather, the GPS is pretty worthless hence the recent release by ASUS of a FREE \"GPS Extender Kit,\" i.e. an added external GPS \"dongle\" that plugs into the bottom port that is supposed to increase/add GPS capability.  And the Wi-Fi tends to work well when right next to a Wireless Access point and/or within a high signal range.  But as soon as you cross the threshold into the medium/low range, for some reason, be it the metal backing plate or whatever, the connectivity drops significantly - for me, by 75-80%!  I didn't even test the Bluetooth connectivity because the Wi-Fi is ESSENTIAL for a tablet.  The whole point is that they are so portable and wireless.  So, no wonder people have mixed feelings about the Prime, especially when a new version is rumored to come out soon, the TF700 series, that conveniently advertises \"enhanced Wi-Fi and GPS capability\" and sports a non-metallic strip of backing right where the internal antennas are located that reeks highly of a fixed version of the Prime.It is this \"mixed feelings\" group along with the plethora of complaints online and my own bad WiFi and GPS experience with the Prime that led me to RETURN it to Amazon the same day.  The fact that Tablets are coming out so ridiculously quick right now signals to me to have a little bit of patience and wait for things to level out and calm down before investing $300-500.  This will not just be a toy for me but just what I mentioned, an investment, and one I hope to enjoy for at least 2 years.  So, whether it be the new this or the new that - I don't really know yet.  But I will, for sure, wait for this market to get a little more Mature before I purchase again.  Until then, my Macbook pro that I bought in 2009 still runs wonderfully and will do just fine.Hope this helps some of you.  I'd wait if I were you.

Had a 64 GB model ordered for a month and was still looking at another week to three weeks before scheduled delivery.  Kept checking Amazon several times a day to see if anything on its site changed and just happened to see that Amazon was selling a few 32 GB Primes for regular price.  I immediately ordered one.  They did not last long.  That was on Wednesday.  It was not suppose to ship until Friday, but it shipped a day early.  As I had signed up for one day shipping, it was at my door on Friday - three days earlier than expected.  Good job Amazon.I have read most, if not all, of the reviews of this tablet on Amazon's site and am aware of the several problems purchasers have reported.  So far I have experienced none of them.  I plugged in the power supply right off and then started using the device while it was charging.  The battery appeared to be partially charged already and it only took a few hours before it showed that it was fully charged.  After I figured out how to connect to my wifi, the tablet reported that updates were available, which downloaded and installed without a problem.  I spent a good six to seven hours on the tablet after receiving it and I had no wifi problems, reboots, or crashes.  Have not tried to see how many GPS satellites it can lock onto.  I do not foresee using that feature to any great degree.As others have stated, it has a really great screen and the tablet is quite thin.  It would have been nice if it had been lighter.  Holding it to read for long stretches is out of the question.  I have a really light six inch ereader that has spoiled me.  However, the ereader is no good for PDF files, but the Prime displays them beautifully.So far I am loving this tablet.  I will update after I play with it some more or if it encounters problems.  Being that it is my first tablet, I still have a lot to learn about it.April 21, 2012:I have had this tablet for two and one-half months now and have been using it most everyday.  I love it.  I have had no problems with it.  I use it mostly to read ebooks, online news, check email, Youtube, Facebook, and a few other duties.  It only has three games on it so I am not a big game player.  It continues to work like a charm.  I generally leave it in sleep mode when not using it.  Occasionally, when it seems to slow down, I will turn it off and restart it.  I do not know if resources are being tied up or not but restarting it solves those problems.  That has not happened but a few times though.I have an ebook reader which works fairly well, but it sometimes takes a number of seconds to load an ebook or advanced to another section, so it is really nice having this tablet and being able to load ebooks, advance and backup either pages or chapters in but a brief moment.I have not used the GPS feature, so its weakness does not bother me.  Sometimes the signal indicator for Wi-fi shows a weak signal, but it always continues to work.  I have my wireless router fairly centrally located, so I am not ever too far away.  Sometimes the signal has to pass through some furniture and a wall or two, but that is about it.  I probably should download an app to test the signal to see how much it is affected when the indicator shows that it is weak.Overall, I am still loving this tablet and have no complaints about it.", "Date": "February 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Better than iPad.", "Author": "flightplan", "ReviewID": "R3EYU0ADDTPHTZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the family an iPad2, then bought the Asus Prime for myself.After using it for a month and reading tons of reviews, I have a lot to say; especially if you are thinking about choosing an ipad vs an Asus tablet.  The iPad is pretty good. I really think it's easier to use. Their commercial once said, the first time you pick it up you'll already know how to use it. It's a true statement. It is easier to use than Android, even the new Andriod ICS (Ice Cream Sandwich). The iPad2 screen is crystal clear, they're supposed to be technically equal but iPad for some reason seems a little better than the Asus. Another plus for Apple is that they have a lot of Apps, double that of the Andriod from what I've read in reviews. However, their apps seem to be incomplete. Like Facebook. You can log in and see the home page but you can't use the chat function unless you buy a $2 app for chatting and that's stupid.Another thing that bugs me about apple is their us or nothing attitude. itunes, ibooks, istore..yes they begrudging offer amazon music or google but their stuff is all proprietary and doesn't play nice you want to listen to the music on another device- even with their cloud. Funny thing about the cloud, Andriod had the cloud from the beginning and you can share bookmarks, contacts, music, files anywhere. With Asus/Andriod, you have mp3, buy from any store online, and there's more music to choose from. Books can be bought from any bookstore. Although, you'll have to choose what's best for you; Amazon, Nook, Asus, Google..Finally, one more thing about Apple. not using flash player. Yes, they say it's going to be replaced with html or something but that's probably years from now. Stupid apple, half the time you go to a site that offers a video you can't watch it on apple. Not a problem with Asus, and the video plays smoothly.The Android, once you get used to it, it way more flexible. You can group the apps on the page, make better folders. More apps are free, more complete.and now the part about Asus being so great..Data Input- Asus has swype and it makes writing 100 times easier. Don't want to type, Asus has this cool dictation feature that prints text as you talk. It's not perfect yet but iPad doesn't' have anything like that.Awesome video game graphics. Really cool and I'm sure there's more apps coming soon. I'm not a big gamer but the tegra games are really fun.Sound- put the headphones on and listen to the music! it has a more advanced sound card and it sounds rich and full.

SOLID build quality, strong processor, good battery life, excellent display, lightweight, and able to handle every and anything i threw at it with only the very sporadic hiccup such as screen lag or a force close...at first, the only thing i could possibly complain about was the single speaker. i dind't think it was loud enough and just having the ONE was kind of a bummer if i held it or laid it a certain way and it muffled the sound. (cue you're holding it wrong joke) however i found a free app in the market that enhanced the speaker volume and had a built in equalizer to tweak the sound and definitely made me a happy camper.however, there was another thing i noticed immediately and thought this COULD be a problem and serious design flaw...the beveled edge combined with square edged components ie charger port, 3.5mm jack, sd card slot...the 3.5mm headphone jack i don't think has caused any problems...i did get some lousy sound which at first i attributed to being able to see almost half the jack on the bottom edge even though it was flush with the top edge, but i think my headphones are just shite...so that ones a wash...but the sd slot and charger are a little more problematic...i mean maybe it was wrong of me to assume that having an sd card slot meant i could expand the storage capacity indefinitely rather than just having a convenient method to transfer things on and off of my tablet. but when you insert a micro sd card, it will stick out some because of the rounded lower edge of the tablet. could they not have just recessed this slot a couple more millimeters to at least try to have the sd card flush with the lower edge? overall this is kind of nit-picky as it does not stick out THAT much, but it IS noticeable...you can see it and if you run your hand down the side you can definitely feel it.the charger is my biggest concern...recently i noticed my tablet was being temperamental with charging anytime i would try to plug it in...sometimes it would charge, sometimes it wouldn't...sometimes it would at first, then give out after a while or if i moved it etc...this was probably the first time i really looked at it and noticed that when its plugged in, the top (screen side)of the charger is flush, but when i flip it over, the bottom is barely half way in because of the beveled edge. this gives A LOT of freedom to movement and the charger can easily wobble much more than any other electronic device i've ever had...because of this, i noticed that the charger has been bending the connector pins and misalign them causing the intermittent charging problem. perhaps this isn't a big problem for people with the dock since there are two more points of connection and it increases stability, but i have never had any intention of buying the dock because i want a tablet and i already have a computer.i feel like this is potentially a serious design flaw and i've already seen that i'm not the only one with bent connector pins...i still love this tablet and i'm not here to bash it or android, but i think people need to know that your sd card will stick out a little and at least be careful when plugging in your charger because the connector pins are pretty exposed and fragile and it can move around a lot", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Investing so much time, energy and money on the Prime", "Author": "Zagman \"Commander Z\"", "ReviewID": "R3S94LVBN0LUOK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I just have to echo the review below mine and reflect on my own experience.

I tested my ASUS Prime against Samsung & Motorola tablets' receiption within the same location. The ASUS was no match, it did not even come close with it's weak Wi-Fi receiption.The funny thing about my own experience is that I waited to get a late production unit, so I got mine early March with weak Wi-Fi and GREAT GPS.

The organization features that allow you to create notebooks, and pages is also fantastic.

I am glad I waited for the Prime, as I feel it is something powerful enough to grow with me in the years ahead.Pros:- The biggest advantage of the prime is the option to add the keyboard.  It really adds a level of versatility that is currently not matched by anything on the market.  Feel like just browsing around the web or checking email?  Use it as a tablet.  Need to write longer emails or documents?  Attach the keyboard and you have a laptop that is considerably lighter than any laptop I've used.- Battery life is really impressive.  I've been blown away.  It lasts for days.  As in, I charge it Monday and it still has a charge on Friday.  To get these results, I'm obviously not using it constantly, but for my nightly email and blog reading, it's great.  The keyboard has it's own battery that charges the Prime when attached.  Together, the Prime lasts about 16 hours which is 6 hours longer than any tablet available.- The screen is very sharp, and the ability to turn the IPS mode on and off (and with just two taps) makes it that much more easy to use.- The Tegra 3 processor really hums.  I have played a few games and it has no problem keeping up.  Also, I am able to browse with more tabs opened in my browser than I can on my netbook.- Android ICS Operating System is a great user experience.  I love all of the flexibility Android allows, and firmly believe it's the best mobile operating system right now.  As a gmail user, I absolutely love the built in Gmail app which is better than either the web page or what's available on non-Android tablets.- Great support from Asus.

I'm happy to say that after 2 weeks, my Prime received an OS update and I haven't had any problems since.Cons:- The only real con is the GPS issue.  Many units don't have a functioning GPS.  I don't even know if mine is one, because since it's WiFi only, I have really no use for GPS.  But it's a real issue, acknowledged by Asus, and if GPS is important to you, I would wait until the new Transformer TF701 or 300 come out in the second quarter, if you want a keyboard, or get something else in the mean time.- Supply chain problems also left me waiting a month after my order for mine to arrive.  Not the end of the world, but it's hard to get excited about a product when if you brag to your friends about it, they can't even go get it because it's so hard to find.- The speakers are kinda meh.  There really should be two for stereo.  But really, how often am I using the speakers on a tablet anyway?  On planes, trains, etc, I use headphones, but it's worth mentioning if it's a feature that's important to you.Overall, I think the Prime is a really impressive product.  As a tablet, it allows me to check gmail, read blogs from my reader, and the Washington Post from Press Reader (pre-installed, and really nice) in a great, light, portable form factor.  Add on the keyboard, and now it's a light weight laptop that allows me to review and edit photos on my SD card.

The WiFi was horrible. I could maintain a decent signal as long I was in the room with my wireless router (Dir 655). As soon as I left the room the signal would drop dramatically. It would say 54mb connection in the room and upstairs in my bedroom it would say about 11mb or less. The only other things in my house using WiFi are phones and Ipod touches so I checked them to see their signal and they were all 90 to 100% full signal. All upstairs in my room or even in my kids room which was further away.What I don't understand is...from all the research I have done on the TP. I have been to dozens of web sites, read hundreds of reviews. And the problem has been verified to be a hardware design issue with the metallic back. Now, how is it some people are having no problems with the WiFi and some are? I don't get it. The only possible explanation I can come up with is they realized there was a problem as the first batch was going out the door so they changed the location of the antenna in the later batches. This was leaked out before the TP was released (when mine was on pre-order) and Asus denied it. If this the case I would gladly keep buying and returning until I get one with no WiFi problems. I actually loved the TP except for the WiFi problem. Since one of the primary things I was going to use it for was my own little Netflix streamer, this was a show stopper.Since the TP was my first tablet I wanted to compare it to (from my research) is the best Android tablet out (non-TP) so I bought a Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1. So far I really like the Galaxy Tab. I do not have any of the WiFi problems I had with the TP. I can stream netflix any where upstairs with no problem, not buffering on a 45 min episode of Stargate SG-1. The Galaxy doesn't tell me my actual connection speed (that I can find) so just going by the bars...i get 4-5 constantly.If someone could verify for me that the WiFi problems are just with some TPs...like maybe just with the first batches, I will gladly take my Galaxy Tab back to BB and keep ordering TPs until I get a good one.Another thing, one of the things that led me to the early/late batch theory was, the TPs in the UK are not having the WiFi issues (from what I can find) and they got the second batch behind our intial batch.", "Date": "January 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great product , just the best table money can buy for now", "Author": "Jorll", "ReviewID": "R2BYLAJUU7IBAT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After having the Prime for 3 weeks i am very happy with it.

The wifi I had no problems with but I didn't put much thought into it because I was only feet away from my router. I went downstairs to see if I could receive any signal and that where the disappointment came in. I could barely hold any connection and when it did it was very slow. I was extremely disappointed and even more so since I bought it from gamestop and once you open it you're stuck with it. Out of curiosity I powered down to see if that would help  since after the update to ICS I didn't do so and to my surprised it actually worked! I was able to get wifi signal in the first floor (router is in the second) and it managed to stay connected where before it would disconnect me. I even tried it from my car and it still received wifi signal. Right now I'm at the laundry mat which has a wifi hotspots and Im connected with any problem. I do notice the bars going up and down but that hasn't affected my connection speed.I haven't tried the GPS yet but I'm not too worried about it since I didn't purchase this tablet for the GPS.

If anyone has any tips on how to fix that please help!!I gave the tablet 3 stars because while overall I'm happy with my purchase i however do not like how ASUS is dealing with the issues people are experiencing. If we are paying $600 for a product we either expect the product to be fully functioning and/or have full support from the company.

After couple of minutes researching in google, I had learnt that this is a problem A LOT of people are having with their primes. Whenever the screen is dark, you can not tell. But if you use your tablet for websurfing, kindle etc, you always have these annoying white spots in front of you. I decided not to send the table for RMA, given the terrible reviews of the ASUS support!Another two months on, I tried to dock the tablet to the keyboard and... NOTHING! Would be able to charge, but not type!!! After rebooting, redocking, etc etc. decided to take a look at the connector. basically one of the pins was a bit up. It probably got damaged after docking the keyboard. I look after my gadgets and I am sure I did nothing wrong with the tablet! After some more googling I found more people suffering from the same problem. This time I was really close to sending to RMA, but still wary....Last week after disconnecting the tablet from the power supply, I discovered that the connector was completely damaged!!! Although the connector really looked fragile and damaged, it was still charging.but I thought it was just a matter of days until the whole thing would get damaged! Finally I sent it to RMA!!!Anyway!!! After waiting for a couple of days, the tablet arrived at the support center and according to them it is a customer induced damage!!!! At the moment i don't know how much they will rip me off to get it fixed and whether it is going to be effective or not!In summary it is a nice gadget. But I don;t remember having an electronic device in 32 years of my existence that gave me so much trouble!!! All I know that was my first and last Asus!!! Gave the wife an Ipad! Although I don't like the apple products, I have to say that she is far happier than I am with my ASUS. I regret not buying the Samsung Galaxy Table instead! I have the phone and have been working flawlessly for two years!!!--------UPDATE---------I have just received my prime back from service. I must have looked younger than my little daughter..... I have to say that they seem to have done a great job with the Tablet. Ok ok they have charged me 28 euros for the connector, but the screen (white spots issue) was fixed within the warranty. Overall I am pretty satisfied with the customer service. Although the online status of the repair was a dreadful experience, the ASUS representative that contact me initially with the status of the RMA was very helpful by email and I had a prompt response. After receiving the tablet fixed and working properly (like new) I would give 4 stars for the customer service. Considering my initial 2 stars for the table I will raise my review to 3 stars, hoping that my tablet will last long enough.", "Date": "August 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "asus tf-201", "Author": "Timothy Harrington", "ReviewID": "R124HIM7225P52", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got tablet and everything was fine.

I'm just pointing out some flaws of most tablets for those that may not know what they're getting themselves into.It's one of the better tablets out there but tablets are still a novelty item.  They have their uses but they definitely aren't notebook replacements and have a place where you don't want to wield a notebook.  Overall it's a good addition to my device collection but my Dell Inspiron Duo provides a better \"real web\" experience because it has a real desktop OS.  The color doesn't look gray to me but what a champagne would look like.  I've never seen a champagne in person and I've verified the model numbers in store as well and they say gray.I've used the Android OS since the HTC G1 came out and have every major version up through 4.x.  Once mobile Flash was finally introduced, pocket web browsing became a much better experience.  The worst thing about stock Android is they never fixed their e-mail client (no, I don't use their gmail and use an ISP) and it still has the same basic problems since the beginning.  They obviously don't care since they want you to use gmail.The apple crowd have it worse with the lack of flash support but everyone hates being redirected to a mobile site when they've paid good money on a capable machine.  Changing the UserAgent usually doesn't work much these days.  Some sites provide you the option to go to the full site but many don't.  And some sites want you to download a stupid application for a web site.  Hmmm, I just want one web browser for every web site I visit, not an application for every web site I would visit.  I don't need the appcrap kind sir.  The googletv falls into this category as well.I also don't enjoying going to YouTube and getting a notification that the video is not allowed to play on my mobile device.  It's bad enough we get notifications that the video isn't allowed in your country.  Some streaming web sites will also give you the 'no mobile devices allowed'.And the applications.  Everything I ever downloaded for the Android platform has been free and I like it that way.  Maybe I deserve what I get for not paying for the full version but I'm sure that's not the case.  One size does not fit all...installer beware.  Because of the splintering between manufacturers and wireless carries (talking versions) on all these mobile devices, not everything works the way it should or even at all.  The same goes for OS updates.  If you're on a telephone then you're pretty much at the mercy of your wireless provider and what they determine the shelf life of your 3-6 month product.  Good luck getting updates up through your 2 year plan.  Tablets are another story if they're WiFi only models.  Good luck with the vendor.  At least Asus has been okay thus far but I'm sure we've seen the better days of updates.  What if Microsoft didn't provide you Windows Updates after owning your shiny new Packard Bell for 9 months?Oh how I hate virtual keyboards for anything more than inputting passwords....Complex passwords?  Fugetaboutit!!  I picked up the keyboard for this and it's a lifesaver for typing.  I'd like to see Microsoft Surface users enjoying their spreadsheets with a touchscreen.  I'm looking forward to the Surface platform because if it solves the issues I state above, so long Android.Life's Connected Rules:You shouldn't tote around any mobile telephone with a screen size larger than 4\".

The main reason that I selected the Prime was its expandability, compared to the iPad. The Prime starts with 32G, plus 32G microSD make expanding memory for movies and music a big plus. Then, add the keyboard and you have another SD card slot, and unlimited memory expansion via the USB 2.0 port.The main Con is that the network sensitivity is poor. My wireless access point is located several bedrooms away, and the performance is marginal; and sometimes will dropout entirely. My Dell laptop and desktop network adapters in the same location are almost full strength, and have no signal problems. Trying to watch Netflix is a bit irratating, due to network data freezes; and it seems to be getting worse.The other thing problem is the 'free' GPS dongle to address the GPS antenna problem. It significantly improved performance; but makes it so that you can't have the docking station or power supply plugged in at the same time. I tried using the pad and GPS dongle to navigate in my car, with very limited success. The Prime got noticeably warm, since the display has to be on constantly, and GPS performance was marginal (I lost signal if I laid the pad on the passenger seat.) The battery was about half drained after about 30 minutes. I have kind of given up on using for navigation purposes.Otherwise, the Prime's performance is pretty good. It locks up about once every 3 or 4 days, forcing a restart. Avoid the Prime, unless you plan to be in the same room as your wireless router. Overall, the Transformer is a really great idea, but unfortunately, the Prime has some engineering issues. Given that Prime problems have been addressed in the T300 and T700 models, stay away from the Prime T201. Now that the T700 is out, I wish that I would have waited. The Prime is destined to become extinct real soon.Updated Review 10/1/2012:ASUS issued an RMA for the weak WiFI performance, and I got the tablet back a few days ago. WiFi performance has improved, but still not stellar. Anyhow, I increased my rating for the tablet from 3 to 4 stars based on ASUS customer support for RMA. An ASUS representative actually contacted me due to my Amazon review and set-up the RMA, which included covering shipping back for repair. Repair was pretty painless, though I did miss my Prime while it was gone. I still would recommend a T700, but am throughly impressed by ASUS customer support.", "Date": "July 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "prime review", "Author": "David C.

I believe this is a serious design flaw that still has not been addressed even on the new infinity! the charging node is not protected and will loosen up with wear as well as the teeth are very brittle and delicate! my advice be very careful connecting your prime to your dock as well as your charging cord but my opinion is this problem is gonna happen to every prime owner in time! so there is my review truth be told i really liked my prime! but i had to send it back because you cant use what you cant charge!So good luck in the future with your prime everybody your gonna need it!", "Date": "July 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "ASUS Transformer Prime Questionable", "Author": "Yan", "ReviewID": "R1705KQVGBJZW2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It's been few weeks using this machine and not satisfied with it.

If you plan to take notes by hand with a capacitive stylus then you will be sorely disappointed. This is the reason for a star missing. I ended up getting this tablet at another retailer and wanted it primarily for taking notes in school by hand with a capacitive stylus, but it just isn't possible to write on it like you would a piece of paper. The diagonal line test (search google for diagonal line test on capacitive screens) fails miserably. If you wrote in huge handwriting so that only one or two words fit on a line then you'll be alright, but if you would like to mimic paper as closely as possible then you're out of luck. Try something like the Lenovo ThinkPad tablet or Galaxy Note (these have special styli that are far more accurate).  Also, touching with fingers works perfectly, I am specifically referring to writing with a stylus.Conclusion:  If the writing doesn't bother you, then I would have to say that this is the absolute best tablet on the market. It easily bests other Android tablets in terms of speed and design. In my opinion, it even edges out the iPad as far as design and specifications go. Plus, you get way more for your money. The fact that there is a dock that gives you a keyboard, more battery life, and USB port just pushes it over the top.

I went back and forth quite a bit, but decided on the Prime mainly because I like the Android OS better and I could use the apps I had on my phone.I admit, I did get a defective one initially.  It had a defective screen, in that 1/4 of the screen would suddenly just be vertical lines.  Everything else worked fine.  I returned it and had to wait a few weeks for them to be in stock again.

We bought this tablet in May 2012 and in July 2012 we were unable to use it. The device just all of a sudden stopped working. Of course we tried all the possible things, went online, red about what we could do if something like this occur....but non of the options helped. We tried holding the power button down for a longer period of time, we tried holding the power button along with the volume button, we even tried to reset it...nothing. Also noticed a weird design of the charger area on the tablet, the pins are just kind of standing there freely, some of them seemed to be bent. A few days after finding out about the problem, while considering what to do,we tried to turn the tablet on again and it worked. All the data were there, nothing was lost.But after turning it off again and back on, just to see, if this is permanent, it didn`t turn on again. So decided to have it repaired. The ASUS customer service also recommended the previous steps, but as I explained them that they don`t work, we started talking about repairing the device. We are a military Air Force family currently stationed in Germany so we have an APO address. We have bought the tablet online from US. The agent recommended us to ship it to somebody we know in the USA (family member or so) and the service team would come and pick it up for repair, bring it back and we would have it shipped back from friend or family. The problem we run into was, USPS no longer ships anything overseas with lithium batteries in it. We purchased the tablet just barely before this came out. So after calling the customer service again and explaining the situation, we were told to contact the ASUS German customer service and have it repaired there as our tablet does have a global warranty.So we did. The device was sent using the pick up service, everything went smooth, it made it to the service center and today I received and e-mail saying the the problem they detected is not included in the warranty and in order to have it repaired we have to pay 53,92 EUR. If we don`t want to pay for it, they will ship us the unrepaired device for 36,89 EUR or trash it for free. So kind of surprised I called the German customer service about why is this so, I got an answer, that one of the connectors was physically damaged and it is not included in the warranty. Now we have a few days to respond. We are people who care for their electronics and try to take care of them. We can`t see how this went wrong. I`m not an expert on designing tablets but just from my point of view, I would have chosen a different design for the connection parts.

Here is the catch: I bought a ASUS Transformer Prime TF201 in March 2012,and almost 2 months ago I started having problems with the vibration module of my tablet. I sent it back to ASUS twice already and it is still broken. I asked them to replace my tablet since I would have to send it for the third time and all they said is that they \"know what the problem is\" (like they said in the previous 2 repair trips) and that they will fix it but they cant replace it. Also, their Costumer Service in general is one of the worst I ever seen!They usually take 3 days to answer your email and they don't give you feedback on the repairing status unless you call them. I am attaching a video of the \"noise\" the my vibrating module in the tablet is doing. STAY AWAY from this tablet if you can!Not worth 650 dollars!", "Date": "July 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Poor cable connection design, worse customer service NOT RECOMMENDED", "Author": "W.

I've 'owned' the tablet since March, but as the first one was exchanged due to the cable connection and the second one had to be sent in for repair within a month of reciept, it's only been in my hands for about 2 months.Now it seems to be operating OK, expectthe poor GPS reception.  Asus never informed me that for a while they were providing 'free' external adapters for them; but only through July 31st apparently.Also, it seems I cannot charge using the USB cable excpet when it is plugged into the Asus 120V adapter; the tablet won't charge from my PC or laptop USB ports or any other 120V/USB adapter I own.I think now it is a decent tablet, but expect better at the price point.  I much prefer the Motoroal Xoom I had and gave to my wife when I bought the Asus (heck, my old Archos 10.1 was more reliable and easy to operate).  Customer service is very poor; though someone from Asus that read my original review anmd contacted me within 48-hours, a much better response time that their customer service (more interested in their imgae than their performance?).ORIGINAL REVIEW.I have owned dozens of portable electronic devices over the years, as well as many PCs.  I have never experienced anything like the problem of the proprietary cable that comes with this tablet.  The first one I bought in March worked for about a month before the metal pins inside the tablet (the 'male' portion of the plug system) became bent, rendering the connection useless; I was unable to charge the tablet.  Amazon replaced that one.  My new puppy dmamaged the cable on the new tablet, though it was still able to charge the tablet; so I ordered 2 OEM cables through Amazon; the first time I plugged one in it bent the pins on the male side of the plug.  Again, not able to charge the tablet.Amazon Cusomer service gave me a link to an Asus \"Live Chat\" site.  For almost two weeks I have visited the site at least daily; the site has either been closed or no Eee pad support personnel are available.I have never expereinced a similar issues with all the other cables, tablets, media players, etc.  I've used many types of cables(everything from ribbon, to parallet, to USB, firewire and lots of proprietary cables) and plugged and unplugged devices countless times without any problems.Asus customer service doesn't seem to exist.", "Date": "June 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "ASUS Transformer Prime with Keyboard", "Author": "Ray H", "ReviewID": "RP123L1Q4QPXG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is positively a great product. I bought the ASUS Transformer Prime, Keyboard (sold separately,)and a leather portfolio case (Bluecell). All are excellant.I originally bought the ASUS for a friend who is vision impaired so that she could read the newspaper more easily (needs large print). The ASUS is serving that purpose well although it did take an e-mail to the local newspaperpaper requesting support for an Android Tablet. If you use lancasteronline.com, do not download their Application - it is for Android cell phones and isn't at all helpful for the Android Tablet. Just use their main website which now works well on Android Tablet. Their support is very good; I received an almost instant response. They have provided any necessary adjustments to their website that was necessary to accomodate the Android Tablet (Thanks lancasteronline.com).Additionally, I have found the Transformer Prime WiFi to have limited range and needed to install a CISCO RE1000 which easily eliminated that problem. I also found the GPS receiver to be less signal sensitive than I expected and requested a bongle (supplied free for the asking from ASUS) which arrived about a week after I registered the Transformer.One additional issue - I thought I understood all I needed to watch streaming baseball games on MLB.COM was Adobe Flash and an MLB.COM subscription; but that isn't correct. The Android version of Adobe Flash is not the same as Adobe Flash for the PC. I'm more than a bit disappointed about that, but that is not a problem with the ASUS Tablet.Having these \"side\" issues I have no problem assigning a 5 Star rating to the product.

The seller was very good the parcel was delivered on time and in mint condition. I have the table for almost 5 months now and i never had any issue what so ever. people have complained about the WiFi and GPS but I have never experience such issue , my transformer picks up the signal pretty well , sometime even better than my Nexus S.This little thing has saved my life several time, it possibility to act as net book(Very portable and fast net book) make this tablet an life changer and although people argue that it pricey, i would say that it worth spending some cash on it . It is solid, the screen is scratch resistant thanks to it gorilla glass and the metallic body make it look very posh and yet durable. Also, ASUS is very good at assisting their customer so far they have been pushing updates very often and fast and I believe it will be even better now that they have sign partnership with Google.The prime is a powerful entertainment gadget, sometime it beats my PS3 as it plays 1080p MKV file very smoothly. Hook it up to the receiver for the best High Def experience. However I have noticed that the sound output while using the HDMI cable is some how mono or only stereo. I hope ASUS or Google find the way around it.The prime came with loads of cool app. My favourite one is MyCloud, which let you control your home pc from where ever you are as if your table was running Windows. All touch gesture are supported (unlike other like Teamviewer)the experience is amazing . one day I went to a party and they didn't have music, thanks to the Prime and the Mycloud app, I was actually playing the music from my home PC but the sound was output on the Prime miles away from home.This is just a little overview of what the Prime has bought to my life...

The TF300 came out right after I ordered it for a hundy less, and looks like, if you are willing to make sacrifices in the storage and display dept., a pretty good deal. But back to the TransPrime. The display is remarkable. The form factor is comfortable and gorgeous, even though there are a few changes I'd make (power button placement being #1). The sound is some of the best I've heard on a portable device, crisp and clear. The tab comes with ASUS WebStorage (8GB free) and being an Android device you also have access to the Google Drive Cloud (another free 8 GB). So if you have a WiFi signal you'll be money in the drive department. Speaking of, a lot of people gripe about the metal back and connectivity issues. I've had none, so far but ASUS will throw in a GPS dongle pro bono.

First off I gave two stars, which could have easily been one because, its the first tegra 3 chip tablet, runs ICS 4.0, and the design is truly nice.Now having said all that, why still 2 stars?  Because Asus sold a product that they did not test and is being sold faulty.  If you, like me, want a working GPS, don't buy this.  I could not get lock indoors ever.  Outside did see one or two satellites peaking 3, but no lock.  I am talking 10 - 15 minutes of waiting.  My three year old phone which is discontinued, also a first gen product takes about 10 seconds to lock with a position and inside right next to the tablet.  Not good.  Now asus tried to cheat this a little by downloading tables from the internet of sat locations.  Thats fine and all, but I don't have wi-fi everytime I need GPS.The other part is if you don't have a wireless point in every room, the wireless signal is very weak.  From the room next to the access point, this table was barely holding 30% signal (which my laptop gets 100% signal and other portable devices hold a strong signal).Clearly there is an issue with making an all metal tablet!  I'm not an engineer, but I know radio waves are affected by metal.  And further when you enclose it in a metal box you will have issues.So now you have to ask yourself, do you want to buy this product knowing you will have issues and for full price.  Or own a product that Asus said was resolved by removing the GPS off the spec sheet (but I already bought it so how does that fix mine).  Further the replacement (TF701) has been created already to resolve this and was released before I even got my pre-order.

To summarize, it feels great in the hand.Performance: aside from the web browser and app force closes, this thing screams. This what honeycomb should have been since the beganning. Screen transitions are butery smooth and videos look great.Screen: the screen is blindingly bright. Colors are accurate, contrast is high. Trust me, you won't be dissapointed.Camera: the camera on this thing is great. I don't know how much you'd use a tablet for a camera but its great and its there!Battery life: you'll easily get through a couple days off a full charge with moderate use. I have no complaints and it seems plenty sufficient.Wrap up The Asus eee pad transformer could very well be the tablet that levels the playing field against the I pad. Honeycomb is where it should have been for a long time and it is going to get even better. If you've been on the fence with either buying a tablet, jumping ship from the I pad, or upgrading from a tegra 2 device, the prime will not dissapoint. Everything just works, and in a snappy and delightful way.

If I go 40 feet from the router I get the message that I don't have connectivity. The transformer is also rebooting on its own. This never happened during the first six weeks - and it seems to be getting more frequent.My first guess is that a patch came and began the problems. When the connectivity issues began, I did a factory reset and everything was great again. Then - unfortunately without thinking - I allowed a number of updates to be done and was back to the irritating no connectivity unless sitting on the router.

I bought my Asus back in January when it was touted as the best of the best and the only iPad killing tablet out there. Well not only has the camera NOT been working since I bought the tablet, but the extremely slow wifi speeds absolutely frustrate me. Unless I am within 10-12 feet of my router (this includes sitting in the basement right near it, or sitting in my living room which is located directly above where the router is located in the basement) the signal is little to nothing. I need to be right next to the router in order to have all the signal bars full...at 10 feet away I already drop one bar.  In 95% of my house I'm lucky if I get one signal bar which means extremely slow connection. My daughter's first generation iPad blows my Asus away when doing anything wifi related. The performance of the rest of the tablet is very good but because the wifi is so absolutely terrible I can't EVER recommend this tablet. What a waste of my time and money.As for the camera.. it has never worked. I have never called tech support so perhaps it could be fixed, but I don't need a camera on my tablet so it's no big deal for me.

It's lightning fast and plays 3d games like they're angry birds on the original iPhone.However, there if one (yes only one) downfall. (Well, maybe two, I'll get to that later. The Wifi connection on the device is a little sketchy. I currently have two \"smart\" devices (not including my laptop), my Asus Transformer Prime, and my Motorola Triumph.I have a Netgear Router that has an \"N\" connection, also compatible with \"a\" \"g\" and \"b\". Ok, solid. So the Prime can connect to N connections, therefore it should have lightning fast speeds... no? Well, despite the fact that there is a router probably a solid 30 feet away from me in my office while I'm in my living room, I generally only have one, maybe two bars. Ouch. Data speeds are not as lightning fast as they should be. If I decide to walk into my office though, I'll just about instantaneously get a solid 4 bars. I have yet to try out anything on Speedtest or any equivalents for that matter, but I can tell you from personal experience that there is a noticeable difference.Now, let's get back to my Motorola Triumph, the small thing only has a 1 Ghz Processor (an old one at that) and can only connect to \"a\" \"b\" and \"g\" networks. Despite that, it gets a solid 4 bars in the exact same place in my living room. And despite the fact that it only has a single core processor that clocks in at 1ghz (well really 1.3 now that I've rooted it, and no I have NOT rooted my Prime... there could potentially be a yet there) it has comparable speeds to my Transformer Prime at times. When we compare that to my Transformer Prime with a quad 1.6Ghz Tegra \"beast\" you can sort of see how come it can get a little frustrating. Now, let's be honest here, the Prime is usually loading full size sites in comparison to the bite sized mobile sites my Triumph usually loads, and it most definitely has faster speeds with all of the \"important\" things like Facebook, so I'll be honest here and say that speeds are if anything slightly faster, but the thing is they should be miles faster. In the words of Samsung, they should be another GALAXY faster... no?The other thing that doesn't work so perfect is the GPS, not always the best, and while I hate to bring up my Triumph again, although I can NOT tell you the exact details of how much better the GPS is, it's certainly better on the Triumph than the Prime...Let's wrap this up before I go write a book. So to finish, even after all that, I would most definitely still recommend the Transformer Prime, the specs are great, the display is beautiful, and the battery life is just incredible (no official tests, but maybe like 10-12 hrs off a charge). On top of that, it's thinner and lighter than an Ipad 2 (thereby making it thinner and lighter than an Ipad 3 as well) and has by far the most responsive touchscreen I've ever used. While most people are probably going to shy away from this product, because the 300 series is coming out for a slightly more affordable price, and Asus is eventually going to be releasing a 7 inch tablet with the same processor specs as this for $250 (rumor), I'd still highly recommend it. As this review mostly seems to focus on the negative, I'd suggest that you check out all of the amazing things that are on the Asus website, because just about every last one of them are true, as long as you can keep in mind that you just might have spotty wifi and bad GPS (although I don't really see the point of GPS on a tablet).", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great computer replacement for non-techies?", "Author": "Tom N", "ReviewID": "R2EJ34YV4VW4LM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own multiple tablets (iPad 1st gen, Kindle Fire 1st gen, BlackBerry Playbook).

ASUS customer service is still very poor, I ended up waiting on the phone another 2 hours after work and while sitting on the phone I recieved an email from ASUS online support recommending a Factory reset.  There were no directions included with the product on how to execute a factory reset but after another couple minutes of searching I found the directions.  The factory reset worked and now the Wifi works.  One interesting tidbit, while searching for an answer to my Wi-Fi problem I encountered an article describing how to increase the Wifi signal.  Based on the locations of the Wifi antenna's within the tablet you simply squeeze on the glass firmly and voila...my wifi signal immediately jumped from 1 bar to a full signal reception.

It looked so thin. This thing is thin. I was expecting it to feel somewhat flimsy but it is the exact opposite. Very well built and very sturdy feeling in the hands.  It is sleek and fast.  Came pre loaded with Android 3.2 but within minutes of having it turned on it wanted to update. The update process took about 10 minutes for the ICS update to complete.  It then updated the camera firmware about 5 minutes. WiFi strength is good. Not quite what my laptops are but better than my cell phones. I am happy with it. I can see my neighbors WiFi signals so no complaints. I usually have 3-4 bars throughout my entire house and at work. GPS works decent. It found my location and locked on within 20 seconds on the first time so no complaints there either.  Battery life is excellent and the screen is beautiful.  ICS lets you disable the stock apps, you cant delete them but once disabled they don't show up or run anymore.Cons:  I noticed a small amount of light bleed in the bottom left corner when it first booted.  It was cold as it had been on the delivery truck all day once it warmed up to room temperature it went away. I had an issue with deleting the pre loaded music and pictures that came installed. I couldn't delete them either with the file manager or with the use of my computer. I searched and it seems to be somewhat of a common problem with the file permissions. The fix was to clear all the data and reset back to original. Worked good and no issues since.

Had I know what a nightmare their customer services is, I would never have bought the unit. The camera died and it took two months to get this thing back only after contacting their HQ in Taiwan.

They also make you pay for shipping.Also, the cheap plastic on the USB cable literally fell off and they refused to replace it.

It's super fast and very easy to use. The construction of the tablet is top-notch. It's a nice weight and the screen is incredibly clear.Now for the two flaws... The plug port is on the bottom (the opposite side of the camera). That means if you use a case/cover like the rooCASE Dual-View Multi Angle, you can't charge the tablet while using the case stand. The tablet has to be laying flat instead of angled while charging. Moving the charge port to one of the short sides (from the long side) would fix this issue.The second flaw is the cable. Mine completely came apart at the USB end where it plugs into the wall charger. I had to use black electrical tape to hold it together, and now the tablet doesn't indicate it's charging when plugged in. Luckily, it does still charge, but the cable isn't communicating that to the tablet. Based on other reviews, this seems to be a common problem.Overall, I'd recommend this tablet and it would get 5 stars by moving the charger port and constructing a better cable.", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fragile connection pins break after light use", "Author": "Daniel Koning \"Literate Gamer\"", "ReviewID": "RI11STJGK9AKG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The machine works fine, but after a week of use, the connector broke.

For example, it is very easy to damage the aluminium casing. By about an year of use, the tablet casing has damages almost everywhere.Now, a fall dislodged the internal power cable from the battery. This should not have happened. The only way to fix this was to open up the tablet. Here is where the biggest issue I have with TF201 is. It has been designed to avoid any kind of repair on the tablet. They would want you to throw away the tablet for simplest of the troubles and buy a new one.Also, we found out the hard way that the LCD screen is extremely fragile and need to be extremely careful if we have to not break it when opening. We broke mine :(. A modular design, that is easy to repair would have ensured easy access to internals of the tablet.The wireless range is so-so. I barely get a bar from a router 1 floor above.

I chose to stick to droid-based OS devices, so this ASUS tablet seemed up my alley.  Some of this review may touch a bit more on the software issues (which isn't necessarily the product's fault).The first big problem is with the wifi connectivity.  I have carried around my netbook, cell phone and tablet around the house with me to test out the connectivity.  The tablet completely loses contact with my wireless router about half the distance of my other devices.  I've taken off the rooCASE Dual-View Multi Angle (Black) Leather Folio Case to see if that was part of the problem.  However, it isn't.  I've tried firmware updates with no luck.The tablet works in about a 35 foot radius from the router.  For me, that doesn't cut it.Support for this particular droid device is rather poor.  The manufacturer seemed to point me to an independently run forum for support questions.  Out of the box, the tablet could not run any flash video (such as stuff on youtube) in fullscreen.  The system would simply hang.  I got no solution to that.  Even 1 year after the fact and with a new droid version the problem still persists.Another issue is the browser window randomly closes.  Manufacturer solution?  Reset to factory default.Some good stuff: It seems to hold a charge for at least 5 days on standby.I've found a few niche uses for it, but I don't recommend this to someone that plans to stream video to it or anyone that thinks it can replace a computer or laptop for internet browsing.", "Date": "April 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love it", "Author": "Ronald Rios Rivas", "ReviewID": "R184QKEO6AL1AJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is a good quality item.

It is easy to use, and pretty fast at responding to apps. I also use it to watch netflix, and the video quality is pretty amazing.The keyboard accessory is what makes this tablet so much cooler than an ipad, in my opinion. It turns your tablet into a small netbook, as well as adding battery life. You can use it to type notes in class or talk on an online forum because it works just like a normal keyboard, but the touch screen continues to work as well. And if you want to go back to reading a magazine, just detach the keyboard, and use it as a normal tablet again. The word processing apps available are not that great, so I would recommend only using it to take notes or rough drafts, or use it online. If you want a fully formatted paper, wait til you are on a PC or laptop--but this works well on the go. Better than putting it in your phone. It is nice to be able to type out emails on the go,though.The tablet is android, so it is fully integrated with Google Apps, which is especially great if you also have an Android phone (which I don't, but it would be nice to sync them if I did). It also has a large capacity for storage, so I use it to carry my music with me, when I want more options than my phone.Battery life is decent--I've gotten through 5 hours of Netflix and still had plenty of battery life left--just make sure you turn it off or put it on sleep when you aren't using it, or it will die while you're not using it.This model uses wifi only, and the wifi connectivity strength is pretty weak, but I'm not sure if that is because our router in our home is weak.

To top it off, there is always a chance of an update coming, so I kept the prime just in case they finally fix all the problems. Here it is, 7 months later, and I still have all these problems. Can't send it back to Amazon. I don't want the hassle of RMA, but I may go that route. Disappointed because when it runs right, its great, but there are too many issues that make it not run smoothly.

Frith", "ReviewID": "RNRTPCD538HRO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I received this tablet a few months ago.  I was really excited to try my hand at Android and use a tablet.  Had never done so before.CONSTRUCTIONThe tablet is solid - the guild is akin to the Macbook Air's aluminum brush and feels pretty solidly built.  A month or two in it feels like the plastic on both sides of the tablet (when held in landscape mode) sometimes doesn't feel flush with the metal.  It's not a deal-breaker by any means - just something I noticed after awhile using it.The device also quickly developed a Mua (not a dead pixel - a discoloration when viewing a white screen) - it's rather apparent on white backgrounds but on other colors it's much less noticeable and on black backgrounds you can't see it at all.  To me it's not a huge issue but disappointing.The screen gets fingerprints VERY easily.  I haven't looked into any screen protectors yet but sometimes when you're working at a certain angle while looking at the screen the fingerprints can be a distraction.Other than that, the tablet feels pretty solid.  I'm overall pretty happy with the build and it feels good in the hands.WIFI/GPSThe wifi signal is roughly HALF what my laptops receive on the same network regardless of what it is.  At Starbucks I hit about 2 bars (Fair to Good strength) but when I pull out either of my 2 other laptops (Both Asus as well) I get full strength (Excellent).  The wifi issue has been talked about at length on forums and on review sites.  I'm using the very latest ICS update as of this posting and I would rate it overall as 'fair' - not great by any means but it does get the job done for the most part.  From what I've read, the Wifi is weak due to the aluminum and/or the placing of the antennas in a bad place on the tablet?  In any case, it's not that great but functional.GPS is dead.  I've heard of people being able to get minimal functionality out of their Prime's GPS but the unit I received as no GPS functionality at all.  I can sit indoors or out and I never get a single satellite through GPS tests.  They did, to be fair, ship out dongles that attach to your charge port that make the GPS work again.  Even with the dongle, the GPS is laggy and still non-responsive at times.  Plus the fact that the GPS uses the bottom port which is used for charging and the keyboard dock (if you have it) so you can't use both at the same time.  Also, many cases won't work with the dongle attachment so you have to put it out to use it.HARDWARE/PERFORMANCEOverall the tablet is pretty responsive.  It works well and is overall pretty snappy to load and switch apps.  However, I tend to use the tablet as a computer and often run multiple apps at the same time and switch often.  This causes the tablet to become sluggish due to it's poor I/O performance (documented).  Somewhat of a fix is to go into the developer options and limit the background processes to 4.  That seems to help considerably and I'm happy with the snappy performance again. :)There are many documented issues with the tablet which are talked about often on forums (XDA Developers) but overall the tablet does what I need it to do.I've been using computers for a bit over 25 years so tweaking and using workarounds to get past some of the limitations makes it works the way I want.  However, a person less experienced might be disappointed with this device.I'd highly suggest going with a Google Nexus 7 instead of this if you can deal with less screen real estate.  The GPS and Wifi work very well on the Nexus and from what I've read it's far snappier due to Jelly Bean (Android 4.1)", "Date": "August 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "I thought the bb playbook was bad", "Author": "Andy", "ReviewID": "R1GBUBQUBVEAV3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "well the rating doesn't lie for this tablet because I got this tablet to replace my bb playbook with its small number of applications in bb app world.  so keep it short the camera got green screen which resulted with more and more sluggish os system.

There is no doubt the specs on the TP sold me so I preordered it.After getting my hands on the tablet, I immediately thought it was the best tablet on the market. The look and feel of the tablet in person is definitely better than that of the iPad 2.I borrowed my dad's iPad 2 and started running tests.Browsing:On honeycomb, browsing on the TP was horrid. Slow loading times and clumsy navigation was frustrating. Scrolling up and down on google's chrome browser was very choppy. Pictures and texts seems come in and out as you scroll on certain websites. After upgrading to Ice Cream sandwich a few days later, the browser experience was noticeably better. Scrolling is very fluid, but not as clean as the iPad 2. Loading times was still an issue.Screen:The brightness of both screens are comparable. Asus is a bit brighter at peak settings, however whites look much better on the iPad 2. iPad has clean true whites as opposed to TP's off white. The TP's whites makes text and other images less vibrant when browsing the internet. Movies and comics on the ASUS prime was amazing however. The colors and details we're very crisp. I think TP beats iPads screen here.App Store:The android app store does not have a tablet only section for apps. Most of the android apps are made for mobile use. The apps made for mobile are upconverted to fit the tablet screen size which degrades the quality and look of the app. The VEVO app for example plays HD videos made for a 4 inch moblie screen. When that video is blown up to 10 inches, the video becomes a blur and colors are washed out. The apple app store has tons more tablet apps and an organized section to browse them.OS:Android has it's benefits but not nearly as refined as iOS.What ultimately pushed me to return the tablet was the recent news that ASUS admitted the design of the TP was flawed which caused the wifi and GPS issues (metal backplate interference). My wifi connection was very weak which contributed to the slow web browsing. GPS worked for me but was not accurate. When I googled my location on the map, it was off about 200 ft. ASUS also announced that a new TP would be released with the wifi and GPS features being fixed. The new TP would also have a higher resolution screen.Overall I feel the ASUS TP is a good product on paper, but it was clearly rushed to meet the holiday rush. The specs did not deliver on all levels because android still has issues it needs to refine and Asus dropped the ball on the design which caused wifi and gps issues.", "Date": "January 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fabulous Tablet", "Author": "K.

First the GPS flat out doesn't work, it won't pick up a GPS signal even outside in the yard.  Asus supplied for a time (expired August 2012) an external GPS antenna, but you can't use the keyboard with the antenna.  Secondly the wifi receiver only picks up the strongest of signals.  I had to add an access point in my family room just for the Asus to be able to work.  I sat in the Fort Lauderdale airport the other day while traveling and the unit would keep dropping the free wifi signal despite that fact that my smartphone showed excellent signal strength.  The onboard audio is so weak that even with noise cancelling earphones you can't hear movies or videos played through the unit in any place with a little noise like an airport or moving car.Finally the last straw was Asus support.  If you're outside the 90 day free technical support period, they won't honor the warranty (even though the warranty is supposed to be a one year warranty).  They want you to pay $166 for a service contract so they can determine over the phone whether the problem is a \"software\" (not covered under warranty) or a \"hardware\" problem before they will agree to even look at your unit.

Could it be just a culture at ASUS to be rude and clueless on how to gain trust from the consumers? May be ASUS should just stick with OEM and stay out of the business of making junk?It appeared that there's something within the TF201 that attenuated both the GPS and the WiFi signals, preventing them from functioning effectively or even functioning at all.ASUS is a bit deceptive when they took the sleazy way out of fixing the problem: they simply removed the GPS feature from the spec sheet of TF201 instead of addressing the problem.This is the kind of company I would hate to waste my money on. So, while I don't like Apple Computers, ASUS has proved to be unworthy of my trust and my money. I have since sent back my TF201 to the seller and would do my best not to spend my money on ASUS.", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "THE WAIT IS OVER!!!", "Author": "The FONZ", "ReviewID": "R1H75RMJDNPG2J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After I got this 32GB Asus for my daughter(6 years by way), I'm blown away how awesome it look and how speedy the processor is.

Most products are not good or bad enough for me to care. This is honestly the worst experience I have ever had with a product. My need for a laptop replacement for college is the only reason it wasn't immediately returned.The short version: don't buy it. The customer service is worthless and the quality control is nonexistent. Go buy a Nexus 10 or something else from Samsung.PROS: None. There isn't a single good thing I can say about this tablet that matters at all to me. The closest I can come is that it's a nice looking paperweight. But honestly, looks are only a pro if it works. Otherwise, who cares?CONS: This one needs categories  BEFORE REPAIR TABLET: The tablet itself was glitchy from day one.  GPS: Like everyone else has said, they suck. The GPS, I can deal with. I wasn't really planning on using it much for that purpose. That said, if you advertise a feature, that feature had better work. If I buy a tablet that advertises GPS, I want to be able to use it whether that's its main purpose or not. The GPS dongle that was ASUS's fix is ugly and prevents the use of the dock, which was a big selling point for the tablet. Before repair, the dongle failed to improve the GPS. It still could never get a lock.  WIFI: Again, it's as bad as everyone has said. I had read that some people had decent signal strength. Mine did not.  GRAPHICS: This was one of the biggest problems. It never could render the graphics properly. Anything displayed on the screen was distorted and shaded oddly. Instead of smooth shading, there were only a few very noticeable breaks where the shading changed. Everything had distorted edges. If I were to guess, I would say the graphics processor was damaged or was not properly attached. This was the one of the reasons I originally sent it in for repair.  FREEZING: This was the other big problem. This thing has a quad-core processor. It had more processing power than the broken laptop it was replacing. It had more than enough power to run everything perfectly smoothly as advertised. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case. It constantly froze on the simplest tasks. Browsing the internet wasn't possible through either the stock browser or any Play Store replacements. The tablet would always stop responding.  CUSTOMER SERVICE: ASUS has the worst customer service period. Honestly, I would get better results from beating my head on a rusty nail. I can't adequately describe how amazingly awful it is. When I first contacted them, they were quick to issue an RMA. That was the only thing they did quickly. The repair center had the tablet for 6 weeks. I had no contact from ASUS about what was going on. Their repair status website had some cryptic code that meant nothing to anyone who didn't work at ASUS. I had no idea what was going on. I honestly think they just dumped it in a corner somewhere and forgot about it. Things finally started moving when I filed a complaint with ASUS. However, they still did not tell me what was going on. They intentionally waited almost 2 more weeks to respond to my complaint after the delivery confirmation informed them I had picked up the tablet. This response actually took me longer than necessary to decipher since they couldn't be bothered to glance over the couple of sentences they wrote. This pathetic example of how NOT to conduct business would have concluded here if the tablet were actually fixed. It was not.  AFTER REPAIR TABLET:  GPS: Without the dongle, the GPS was unimproved, but it works with the dongle now.  WIFI: Wifi is about the same. It will never have perfect signal strength because of the design flaws.  GRAPHICS: The constant bad shading and edges were mostly fixed. I say mostly because while it isn't constantly messed up as before, the graphics still freak out periodically.  FREEZING: The freezing is much, much worse, and it continues to get worse.  TOUCH: This is a new problem since the repair. Many times when I touch the screen, it will react as if I touched a completely different area. It won't always recognize swiping to scroll a page. This is also getting worse.  MORE CUSTOMER SERVICE: Since the repair actually made the tablet worse, I unfortunately was not done dealing with ASUS. Instead of offering a replacement or an advanced RMA, they continued to insist that I send them the tablet again. Surprisingly, I don't trust them any more. After waiting 6 weeks to receive a tablet with more problems than it was sent with, I just don't think this particular tablet is reparable. Since they refused to help, I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. I won't give any details from that other than the complaint is still open after 5.5 weeks.If you've made it this far, I should add one more thing. ASUS knew about every one of these problems before they released this model. It was replaced in less than a year by a fixed version, the TF700t, aka the Transformer Pad Infinity. The only difference in specs is a slightly higher resolution screen. The tablets are sold for the same price. Actually, I just checked. Amazon sells the 64 GB version of the TF700t for less than the 64 GB version of the TF201.", "Date": "December 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Broke way to easily", "Author": "Jose", "ReviewID": "R1YZCZ3AP2VZAH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I owned my Asus Transformer Prime for less than 6 months and the cameras just stopped working and now it will not even take a charge.

I debated cancelling my order, but couldn't justify buying an older tablet for nearly the same price.The construction of the tablet is good; it doesn't feel as cheap as some of the other tablets I looked at in the stores.  The screen looks good, but like most, it is a fingerprint magnet.  It either immediately shipped with Ice Cream Sandwich (ICS), or the first update I installed out the box upgraded it.

The front camera works well for quick Skype sessions.Testing of my unit shows that the GPS is lacking against my Galaxy S phone, but what has really hurt has been the weak wifi reception.  I wound up taking a class this semester in an area that gets awful wifi reception.  It's fine for laptops, but not strong enough for phones or tablets (at least I don't see any other students using their tablets in the classroom, either).

Now I see what everyone else is complaining about.  I currently own a TF101 and compared the two side by side.  I used \"WiFi Analyser\" app and walked around my house and yard to see how they compared for WiFi reception.  The TF101 was better most of the time by 10 to 20db.  The Prime (TF201) was always lagging behind in updating it's signal display, like it was thinking about it for a while.  I have a feeling that was the software emulation trying to sweeten the signal.  The the GPS was looked at using \"GPS Status\" app and the TF101 killed the Prime in reception in all areas.  The TF101 averaged 8 to 12 satellites outdoors and the Prime would only find a max of 4-6.  Then get close to any cover, like a back porch roof and the signal died out on the Prime while the TF-101 held a min of 5 satalites and even while indoors throughout my house.  I am appauled that a company like ASUS would put out their premier Android tablet with these flaws.  They have always impressed me with their products until now.  That explains why they removed the mere mention of GPS from their website add and descriptions.  Then on top of that they announce a new version (TF701) will be released soon (3rd quarter 2012) that will fix these issues and take the screen resolution higher to full HD.  For the price they are asking it aut to work right.  The unit is significantly more in price than the TF101 and the keyboard/battery accessory is double the price of the one for the TF101.  It's not worth it to go backward in performance in two key areas.Pros: I will say the new processor is great.  The increased memory is great.  Gorilla glass is clear and the screen is bright.  Android Ice Cream Sandwich is better but they (Google) missed the mark with this one too in a particular area.Cons: In addition to the above....The proprietary power cord is still a serious irratant. Also the location of it on the bottom of the screen is horrid when using it in conjunction with a case and trying to tilt it up for viewing.  They can add a micro usb hub on the side and be able to charge the unit with the cords we use for our phones, thus eliminating having to carry another one around.  Obviously they are betting on everyone getting the Battery/keyboard accessory.  The Ice Cream Sandwich missed a key feature improvement that HTC got correct in adding to their EVO 3D 4G.  This is where you can continuously scroll the app screens in both directions and they loop around instead of stopping 2 to the right and 2 to the left of center or home screen. I am very dissapointed this feature was not included.  I find it one of the best improvements to Android yet.  Lastly I had many screen lockups in the safari browser included in the Prime.  I would average one lockup every 30 minutes of continuous internet use.  Firefox was better but not bug free.  This tells me that there are conflicts with the video card and the touch screen or somehwere in between.  I would have to power cycle most of the time to get it back when going to standbye didn't work.  I have used the Prime for three straight weeks in all kinds of conditions.  I have updated the firmware and have Adroid 4.03 on it.  Asus could have done this better for the money.In conclusion: Not worth the money at this point. Wait for the TF701 and see what they do then.  It must be bad if Amazon removed it from sale by them and only have refered venders selling it for even higher prices.

Having had a long history with iPads I was concerned that the Asus quality or performance might not match-up. I was also concerned because of the often discussed Wi-Fi and GPS issues with the Prime. But once I received and had it in my hands I could tell that much of those concerns were unfounded. The Asus Transformer Prime performs just as well as my iPad ever did. You can point to specs and bench-marking data to define those things that are not perceivable to the naked eye if you want to, but I am certain that most folks will never see or feel the difference. After using an iPad for many years I can honestly tell you there is not one thing I can not do with the Transformer Prime that I could do with my iPad. There is no limitation on available apps and the Transformer Prime even has a setting that will not allow you to accidentally install up proven apps... unless you want to (something iPads will not let you do). While ALL tablets can not be considered a full-blown computer or laptop experience, the Transformer Prime is as close as you can get. One of the primary differences between an iPad and the Transformer is that you have the ability to do REAL file management. Download files move them to new or existing folders, share the same file with multiple apps and move copy and paste files as needed. I also purchased the Keyboard Dock and it too is wonderfully made and perfectly functional. The quality and the workmanship on this product is excellent and I am so glad I went with the Prime and got the beautiful metal finish. There is indeed a GPS issue and you will need to order the free GPS dongle. The Wi-Fi issue is over blown, at least for me, I have not had any issues at all with Wi-Fi the connection strength \"perhaps\" fluctuates from time to time but I have not notice any issues with performance based on the Wi-Fi.  I have had to do a reboot (reboot is very quick)on it a few times because of some quirky behavior but its not like I did not have to do the same thing from time-to-time with my iPad.From a user standpoint I see the Asus Transformer Prime as an iPad equal. Yes the display is not 400 times better than your HD TV but I challenge you to notice the difference when you have it in your hands. The speed and responsiveness is equal to if not exceeds my iPad. I can recommend the Asus Transformer Prime without hesitation.", "Date": "June 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Incredible", "Author": "garik", "ReviewID": "R1DK8F12TZJ3LD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The new asus eee pad transformer is fantastic.

After asking how old it was I accepted (I wanted the latest hardware revision to minimize WiFi/GPS problems).  I got a tracking number the day after I ordered it, but the unit did not ship for another week.  When it came it was in a generic box without owner's manual or ASUS warranty card.

I will not offer detailed technical specs, only end-user observations relative to a few relatively esteemed contemporary offerings.In my fleet of gadgets I currently have an Acer Iconia Tab A700 (with 1920x1080 screen), Google Nexus 10, Google Nexus 7, Acer Iconia Tab A500, Samsung Galaxy Tab 10 (first generation, 1280x800), a few other gadgets, and of course, this one. I use these (other than comparisons) for casual web browsing, watching Netflix, common utilities (calendar, calculator, alarms), and... gaming! I'm current on all of the latest Gameloft and other releases - Grand Theft Auto, Bard's Tale, NOVA. I do have a PS Vita but it's hard to spend time with that tiny screen when you can play on a full 1080p screen that weighs less and is no less mobile.I don't care about the iPad. I have chosen not to participate in the Apple cult; I equate it with the Scientology of electronics. Sleek, sexy, attractive, grossly overpriced and basically you panic about whether you look cool enough to justify the amount of money you paid to get it. Massive fail; instant pass. Let the Flying Spaghetti Monster defend Samsung from Apple in all the courts on the planet. If you want to have an Apple object (i.e., you have too much money for your own good and it leaks out of your pockets, and you'd just like to direct some of that abject waste towards Cupertino), actual technological and capability comparisons are irrelevant.I ignore Windows 8 for now because Android is first, better, free, based on Linux, does everything I want it to, even, incredibly, locate my network printers... what's Windows again?That is a background of the devices I can compare it to in first-hand experience. Quite a bit. All the best of the Android world.BRIGHTNESSOf the three major contenders - Acer Iconia A700, Google Nexus 10, and Asus Transformer Prime, this Asus is the brightest. The IPS+ mode is ABSURDLY bright. Don't turn that mode on when you're in bed in a dark room, you'll burn your web page into your retinas until tomorrow morning. It is bright enough to work outside in broad daylight. It will drain the battery but it's enough to watch one of the Lord of the Rings movies... extended edition... in broad daylight. Surprisingly, the Acer is second, and the Nexus 10 is third.And here's an observation for you: watching a high-def movie or TV show on the Nexus is an incredible experience. The Acer is even better. The Asus is even better than that. This thing's brightness and sharpness, when watching high-def video of any kind, is just awe-striking.RESOLUTIONThe Asus and Acer both have full 1080p screens; the Google Nexus has the \"+1\", 2560 x 1600. Is it incredible? Yes. Is it worth it? Not necessarily. Many apps don't work on the non-standard, ultra-high resolution of the Nexus. So, while the operating system and browser is unbelievably high resolution, the 1080p displays are also fantastically sharp, most apps work with them, and if there's a trade-off between the unbelievable brightness of the Asus and the incrementally higher resolution of the Nexus, the brightness is by far the more practical spec.As far as the \"retina\" claim, I'm extremely near-sighed. That means, with glasses, I see what you see with relatively normal vision. Without my 9-factor glasses, I can see something a couple inches from my face at super-human detail. So, if you're nearly legally blind, you will see the pixels. If you're a relatively normal-vision person, these will be brilliant, perfectly smooth colors and shapes, all. Even the relatively inexpensive Acer. As far as technicalities, the Nexus weighs in at 300 pixels per inch, while the iPad is at 264 and this tablet (Transformer Infinity) is at 224 ppi. Nevertheless, if you aren't as near-sighted as me, with your glasses off, looking at the screen with your glasses off and four inches from your face, you will not see pixels. It's brilliant and sharp. No qualifiers.If you need the highest pixel density, that's the Nexus 10's party piece. That's why I bought it. But there is just no way you can find fault in a display like the one on the Asus.SPEED / POWERThe Nexus has 2GB RAM, the Asus still has 1GB which is a bit disappointing. It shouldn't be too difficult for manufacturers to fit 2GB or even 4GB RAM onto these boards. The only reason they haven't is that the Linux core OS with Android on top takes SO little resources that it's crazy to think some web browsing or document viewing could necessitate a full gig of active RAM within the useful life of these devices. The only thing that might push the limit a bit is games. However, the Asus appears to play car racing games, first person shooters, etc., very smoothly. These tablets already have dedicated GPUs, but still use shared RAM - and that may be fine. If we eventually expect our high-definition tablets to play the latest-generation console games it'll be a RAM shoot-out, but for the best games they have for Android (which are really pretty impressive, I have to admit, given that I've been an avid PC gamer since IBM XT/AT days and Xbox/Playstation games for over a decade) this thing runs them smoothly and they look great. Plainly put.SPEAKERSHere, the Asus is better than any predecessor I've owned, the Acer is better than any predecessor I've owned, but the Google Nexus (with front-firing stereo speakers) is the indisputable winner. The sound out of this little hideous gray wafer is truly, truly unbelievable. Of course you don't get booming bass out of any of them but, at the sacrifice of form factor and aesthetics, the Google tablet delivers sound straight at your face, in stereo, which simply can not and will not be matched by ANY tablet with any quality of speakers that point off in another direction. I repeat, the Asus is good, even great. But here, the Nexus wins.AESTHETICSHere is where the Asus pulls away from its direct competitors. I specifically chose the Champagne color scheme, it just looked sexier and a little more different to me than the Amethyst, although I'm sure it's also extremely attractive. The brushed metal shell isn't as coarse as it looks in some of the marketing photos, which is a good thing - it's metal, it's smooth, it's semi-gloss, and it is undeniably sexy. It's an iPad competitor if ever there was one, just by looking GREAT. Of course the IPS+ display is great, but the widget itself is really, really sleek and sexy. The economy super-tablet from Acer is a notch down with silver plastic on the back that is very nice and well put together, but a lot less attractive than the brushed case of the A500 (which I also own). The Acer A700 is much lighter AND much more solidly constructed than the A500, but less beautiful to look at or feel. The Google Nexus 10, as with the Nexus 7 (which is made by Asus!), is a pig. It's thin, light, durable, amazingly well-constructed, the most comfortable to hold (certainly even better than iPad) - comfortable, durable, light, and UGLY. Sorry. The Nexus 10 is ugly.The Asus is beautiful. The case is beautiful. It's smooth, cool metal. It looks great and and feels great. On the aesthetic front, of any Android tablet on the market, the Asus wins. By a mile. If you care about the barista who's watching the back of your tablet and deciding whether you're worth a date, this is worth real money. If you really just care about a good tablet, it's not worth much at all. I'm not choosing sides here; if you want to be holding an incredibly attractive piece of computing jewelry that ISN'T A CURSED IPAD, that's worth quite a bit in and of itself.DOCKAnd here's where the Asus just wins the race. If you're looking for a single solution to everything, the \"dock\" for the Transformer Infinity turns this into an ultrabook. The latest-generation dock allows you to close the thing like a netbook/ultrabook. But let me tell you about the other half of this clam shell.The \"dock\" lets you LOCK the thing into place. It is very nearly as solid and sturdy as an ultrabook once it is locked in place.The true magic is that the dock contains a secondary battery that gives you another 3-4 hours of battery life that back-fills the tablet; it has a full-size USB port, and a full-size SD card slot. The USB port works with auto-detect, it'll charge things and detect things you plug in. The SD card slot lets you add - incredibly - 128GB if you want to fork out the cash for the latest generation of SD cards. 32 or 64GB extra storage are pretty easy these days. That amount of space is enough to store more games, movies, apps than you'll ever use.What you've done is taken a $150 \"dock\", plus this most-sexy Android tablet, and turned it into (\"transformed\" it, if I may)... get this... a 10.1 inch ultrabook (yes, ultrabook) with FULL 1080P RESOLUTION. THERE IS NO OTHER OPTION OUT THERE! Seriously! You fork out about $650-700 and get an ultrabook that looks better, feels better, is cooler, than any other ultrabook, smaller, more compact, as fast... etc. etc.!Additional kudos to the \"dock\": the keyboard is really, REALLY nice. Spectacularly nice. It's an island (chicklet) keyboard. I have a 14\" HP notebook with a miserable island keyboard, poor key travel, poor sensitivity, just miserable. I also have a 11.6\" HP DM1Z that has a very good island keyboard. I'd say the Asus Transformer Infinity dock is better than any of them. The only more comfortable island keyboard I may have ever typed on is the 6 year old Sony Vaio 16.4\" laptop I'm typing on right now. The Asus dock is a CLOSE second!There's a simple fact here: When you add the dock to the tablet, it makes a desktop replacement. It only has one USB port but you can add a powered hub. The full-size SD card lets you add incredible storage capacity. And when you look at what really matters, fabulously compact form factor; comfortable, accurate typing, sexy and cool; does everything this operating system can do smoothly and easily; and you have a 10.1 inch netbook that has a full 1080p screen. You can't find a 11.6\" anywhere with that resolution. Or a 12.1\". Or a 13.3, or 14\", or even 15.6\". 16.4\" is the next smallest screen you will find that has full 1080P.It really is cool.The downside, and it is almost an embarrassing downside, is that the dock's bottom has a cheap plastic champagne-colored case. It does not match the stellar sexy outer case of the tablet.THE VERDICTIf you care about having a bright, sharp screen, fast processor and great tablet for the best price, the Acer wins.If you care about the highest resolution display with ample RAM, instant Google updates and supports on future releases, solid construction and light weight, the Nexus 10 wins.If you care about a sexy tablet, that transforms in to the most compact, attractive and useful ultrabook available on the market, period, the Asus wins. If you want to type on a keyboard, a Bluetooth keyboard won't do justice to this. I'm loving this screen and the fabulous screen and keyboard.Enjoy!The downside is that", "Date": "December 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Would have been a great tablet if the GPS and WIFI would work.", "Author": "Frederick A.

They finally had one in stock at my local BestBuy and I picked it up over this past weekend with the BB Gift Cards i've been dying to use from Xmas.First Impressions:Likes:- Incredibly well constructed with great fit and finish.- Gorgeous screen.  Deep blacks with great contrast.  However, I wouldn't say it's head and shoulders above the Ipad2 screen.  Just brighter with higher resolution.- Very snappy with the ICS upgrade.- Great eye candy with the games designed specifically for Tegra3.- I did not experience the Wifi or GPS issue.  I got full wifi signal with the router approximately 15 - 20ft away and the GPS locked my exact location when i'm next to the window in my apartment.- Solid camera performance for pics and videos (Blackberry playbook still blows away both the Prime and the Ipad2 in that category.  Surprising)Dislikes:- It really boggles the mind how Asus would put the only speaker in a position where your hand will cover it up perfectly.  It truly is a WTF?  However, sound quality is acceptable but not as good as the Ipad 2.- Still not as buttery smooth as the Ipad, especially when comparing the browser.  It seems Apple just got it right with the perfect fluidity when scrolling a web page.  The prime brower is just a wee bit slower than the Ipad's and does lock up intermittenly as other users pointed out.- Not a whole lot of tablet specific apps in the Marketplace.  Very dissappointing considering these android browsers have been around for over a year.  And the few tablet apps that i was able to compare side by side with the Ipad2 (not counting the games designed for the Tegra3), Ipad 2 wins hands down in polish and performance.- The thing is a bit unwieldly to hold.  Since it's so wide, you'll want to use in in landscape mode for everything but it really isn't that comfortable to hold for long periods of time.  Hand fatigue sets in pretty quick.Overall, i'm satisfied with the tablet.  It's a great piece of hardware (minus the laughably bad speaker placement) but let's hope that more developers jump on the ICS tablet bandwagon.  The tiny tablet app selection is quite sad.

After charging, I switched on and immediately received the ICS update. Good start. Or so I thought.The tablet looked and felt as I had expected and first impressions were excellent. Great screen, moderately fast browser and all software working well. That was until I moved to the next room to my router. The WiFi signal dropped off rapidly and some 20 feet away virtually disappeared. Not what you want from a WiFi only device.Problem number two came when I went to check out the GPS. After 10 minutes under an open sky, it intermittently found one satellite but nowhere near a fix.The new update from Asus which was supposed to rectify these problems produced an even worse result. The TF201 was unable to find any satellites at all and there was no improvement in the WiFi performance either.I suppose I could have lived without GPS but there is little point in a WiFi only device that can only be used in the same location as the router.In all other respects this tablet is at the top of the pile but in the final analysis I have to say that it is \"not fit for purpose\" so it has been returned to Amazon (who now appear to have withdrawn it from sale!).No company in my experience handles customer support better that Amazon.

The whole preorder thing was a fiasco, not only with Amazon but with several other places that had to cancel orders. I put that on Asus, not on Amazon. I was able to place an order with BB that arrived after a lot of confusion and frustration (talked to 4 different CSRs and got 4 different answers) along with the dock (ordered from NewEgg) and received both on December 29. I have been following all the problems that others have had with the Prime and so wanted to wait to review it until I had upgraded with ICS and had confirmed that the GPS, WiFi and Bluetooth were all functioning properly as well as making sure there weren't any other fundamental problems. I have to admit that before the ICS update and another later firmware update, things were a little dicey, especially with the GPS and the fact that I couldn't get my Bluetooth headset to pair with the Prime, but since then the Prime has worked perfectly. I don't really care about the GPS, I have good cell phone GPS and also navigation in my car so it is basically redundant to have GPS on the tablet. I suppose it's the principal of the thing though and I can say that I do get satellites, even indoors and they do lock. I compared the Prime GPS with my smart phone and there was very little difference in connectivity.My biggest complaint is that about 3 days after I received it, I got a scratch on the back cover which was really upsetting...the brushed aluminum is so pretty! It is easily marred so you need to be careful. I have purchased a skin that protects it and also store it in a neoprene case. Lesson learned. The dock really does enhance the Prime experience. I like that it locks very securely with the tablet. Not only does it increase battery use but it has virtually replaced my laptop. The keyboard was a little hard to get used to because of the smaller size and I ended up disabling the touch pad because my sleeve would hit it and send the cursor all over the place. No big loss as I hate all touch pads anyway and I was happy to find a way to get rid of it.The only other issue I had with the Prime was the wall charger. The first few times I used it it got exceedingly hot and although I'm not a techie, this doesn't seem like a good thing. I did some investigating and one of the suggestions was that you put it in a plastic bag and then put it in the freezer for 20 minutes or so. Hmmmm, OK it seemed like kind of stupid way to fix it but I tried it anyway. Well apparently it worked because I haven't had any over-heating problems with it since. Who knew.This was my first tablet and so I went back and forth between the Prime and a iPad. I'm just not one of those \"Apple love\" people and feel like Apple products are over rated and over priced. I have a iPod Touch 4Gen that I like very much but hate the paranoid way that Apple and iTunes are so restrictive so I really didn't want to get into that with the iPad. I'm glad I opted for the Prime. I got 2x the storage for the same price and I like that I can use SD and Micro SD cards for additional storage. Also like the USB connection so that I can use a mouse. I like the Android OS. I have it on my phone and it is really intuitive and easy to use...same with ICS on the Prime. There are plenty of apps available.The Prime has exceeded my expectations.

Really nervous after reading all of the negative reviews about Wifi and GPS issues but still hopeful that like some others mine will be OK as far as the Wifi issue goes (a little disappointed about the GPS issue though however It won't be that big of a return factor for me)A bigger disappointment came yesterday as the news with Asus announcing the new TP 700 series in Q2 which is basically the same TP with a new shell design to fix the current Wifi/bluetooth, radio and GPS issues ( yeah i know, Asus will throw in a better screen and better front camera with the upcoming T700 series so that they can justify it as an upgrade) like other reviewers I can't help but felt a bit being cheated by Asus.Finally Amazon deliver this tablet to my door today, after opening the box I immediately forget about all the negative reviews about this tablet.  It is so slim and beautiful.  I gave it a full charge, upgraded it to ICS and after that I test out the wifi range and while it isn't that great compare to my laptop, it's acceptable.  Next I test out the GPS and like others had confirmed, without wifi on, it failed to lock to a satellite while inside the house (I didn't test it outside yet).  The fact that it is so pretty, so thin and light on my hands which make me over look this issue and move on to the next test.  I downloaded a couple of games on the market and give them a try and they were all fine and smooth.  I then spend a rest of the day download a bunch of games from the Market.Then I remember about the camera and want to test it out.  Guess what, when I tap on it, a messy/jittery video screen appear then freeze and black out after that. I powered the tablet off, reopen camera, a black screen came up and about a minute later an error message came up \"camera is not responding would you like to close it\"  Then you have an option of \"wait\" or \"OK\" to close it.  \"Wait\" will not do anything and \"OK\" is to force close it.  I rebooted, reset it to factory but the problem remains.That's it this time I can no longer forgive.This is terrible quality control.

I bought it because it sounded like it was going to be a faster product than anything out on the market.  I've now had my Prime for about 5 months.  I've found the speed to be terrible.  Nearly every web page I open I will get a box that comes up and asks me if I want to wait or close the browser, again, nearly every web page.  It happens on many different WIFI networks I usually use and the pages can be graphic intense or not.  So it's not an issue with WIFI speed or the pages I'm opening, it comes down to something in the software being run.  On the flip side when I'm running a game on the unit the speed and graphics are terrific.  Nearly like a PC.Mechanically, the screen cracked a couple of weeks ago.  I bought the keyboard thinking it would act as a screen protector.  Just opened it up one morning and the screen had a crack right across the top about 1\" below the upper edge.  Didn't drop it or drop something on it.  Very disappointed that this happened.  Reading on the web that others had their screens replaced for $250, I figure I'll live with it for a while until I scrap this junk and buy an iPad.As far as the keyboard, the battery life isn't nearly as good as people claim.  There is no way you'll get more than 10 hours of actual use time.  I would put my use time at something around 5-6 hours with both batteries fully charged.  Also, the mechanical integrity of the keyboard is very poor.  Many of the keys don't register when pressed and require going back to correct spelling.

I have spent a day or so with the thing, and I knew going into it that it was basically just a giant smart-phone, but I am not impressed.  Things I wish I knew...you can only run one app at a time, so if I am watching a youtube video for a song I like and want to go check my email, the song stops.  Also, Wifi is much weaker than my laptop.  The first youtube video I tried took about 30 seconds of buffering before it would start, from the same chair where my laptop would previously start a video instantaneously.  I was uncomfortable holding the thing and trying to type & navigate the web.  If you set it on your lap, you have to crane your neck to see it, otherwise you hold it with one hand and use the other on the touch screen, I guess. Also, there is no brief tutorial or help on how to use the thing.  Even 4 or 5 simple tips when I first turned it on would have been helpful, since I am new to tablet using.  You know, like where and how to load apps.  By contrast, I love my Windows phone (HTC Trophy).  It is easy and slick and intuitive.  Another complaint with Android in general is that I am having trouble loading some apps.  There is a pre-loaded netflix app, but when I try to use it I have to fix some security error, which I have no idea how to do since there was no brief tutorial or help option that I know of.  Also, the sound was advertised as stereo, but there is just one speaker, so i dont see how that is stereo.  I actually bought the PRime instead of the 301 because it had the stereo speakers, but really doesnt.All that said, some of my complaints are with tablets in general, android in general, and maybe some are unique to the Asus Prime.

If u got an iPhone and u want a bigger version get iPad 2 or hd but if kinda bored with apple products and want something super customizable and has slot less restrictions go with the prime. Not the transformer tho because iPad 2 is better than that.", "Date": "March 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Dissapointed", "Author": "lentalsup", "ReviewID": "R1I9MOJ5J3OT79", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was really hopeing to like this tablet.

The drawbacks that made my decision to return it were several things. First was that the quality of the tablet was ok, but should be better for the price. It had significant light bleeds around edges. The glass around the volume switch was slightly lifting and you could depress it. That was definitely poor build quality. The sd card dummy that comes with it was flush to the edge, however when placing a real micro sd card, it slightly sticks out, which for me was slightly annoying. Also the tablet had rather too frequent random crashes and freezes, maybe those were just bugs with ICS, but still very annoying. Maybe I just somehow got a bad unit, but with all these problems combined, it was a deal breaker, and had to return.

People seem upset because they early adopted the TF201 and now Asus announced the TF700T. As recently announced, Asus will charge a $100 premium for a different case backing (read: GPS upgrade), upgrade from 720p to 1080p resolution, and a 0.7 mp upgrade on the front facing camera.Everything else is the same.This is the worst way to spend $100 I can think of. The difference between 720p and 1080p on a 10 inch screen isn't all that amazing or necessary. Additionally you can count on the battery life being worse to support the higher res (no evidence, but Asus said battery life will be \"comparable\" - code talk for worse but only slightly). The camera upgrade is negligible for 100% of users. So if it's worth it for you to drop $100 for better specs on paper, have at it.

There are just too many issues with this device and all of them are due to Asus' terrible software. Here are my main complaints:- Laggy interface: ICS optimized apps do OK on this tablet, but everything else is sluggish and rough, considering the horsepower on tap that is just inexcusable. Even MX Video Player, an ICS optimized app and the only hardware accelerated video player for Android, cannot play HD video correctly with the hardware video decoder. What exactly is that 12 core GPU in there for again?- Internal storage read/write performance: Anything you do that accesses the internal storage causes the entire system to slow down and stutter, so installing or updating an app, unzipping a file, moving files from folder to folder causes the tablet to become practically unusable while it's doing any of these things.- USB transfers: Transferring files to this thing from your computer is nearly impossible, I wanted to put the pictures from my phone on the tablet, about 4 GBs total, I could pull these files off my phone in about 30 seconds, but the same files would have taken about a day to upload to the tablet. USB transfer speeds are crippled, again due to to poor I/O performance of the internal storage. I've had to use AirDroid to transfer files, which still takes a couple of hours to move those 4 GBs.There is also the hardware issues with WiFi and GPS, the GPS is a non-issue for me since I always have my phone with me, but the WiFi performance for me has just been OK but not great.With the recent tablet announcements in the last few weeks I'm going back to the sidelines, I'll even consider the Transformer Infinity if it seems they learned from their mistakes, but mark my words: The Prime is nothing more than a prototype, released for no other reason than to make a statement about Asus' hardware designs and to be the first quad core Tegra device. This is proved by the fact the before the Prime was even readily available at retail there was a better Transformer already developed and ready with a better screen and a better antennae design.", "Date": "March 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Shiny is about it", "Author": "C. Conchi", "ReviewID": "RKNHLWVFXH9V4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I never write reviews since there are more than enough people who are happy to post their opinion about an item.  I'm writing this one since this is by far the biggest technology disappointment I've ever had, and I want people to avoid making the mistake I made by going for a brand new shiny unproven product that has been hyped up so much that it had me drooling over it for months.  If you purchased a Prime and got one of the good ones, or if this is your first tablet and you think it meets your expectations.... great... good for you... enjoy your tablet.  I, on the other hand, got one of the many devices plagued by numerous defects.  After researching tablets for over a month, I purchased an Asus Transformer TF101 for my father.  When I configured and set it up, I was highly impressed and I believe it to be one of the best tablets out there for the money.  This made me drool over the prospect of getting a TF Prime for myself.  With all the glowing reviews from the geek sites, I figured why not treat myself and get the best out there.  I placed my order in mid December knowing that I wouldn't receive it for about a month.  After Google's Ice Cream Sandwhich OS was released for the Prime, I got more excited and started reading all the reviews about how it was functioning for users who already upgraded.  That's when I came upon numerous reviews complaining about poor GPS, WiFi connectivity, and ICS causing issues.  I hoped that this would not be the case for me.  After all, my new TF Prime had not been stocked yet, and Asus would have already started addressing the issues and have a solution in place by the time mine stocked/shipped.  Unfortunately, this wasn't the case.  Upon, receiving my TF Prime, I was indeed impressed by the stunning look, feel, weight, and screen.  I charged it up, and downloaded ICS update.  No sooner than the tablet downloaded ICS did it start to freeze, reboot every time I tried to open a standard app like the camera, 1 inch horizontal black lines plagued the screen, slow internet for the 20 seconds I was able to browse the web before it rebooted, and it litterally was unusable.  I am a technology guy so I know it wasn't a user error of interrupting the upgrade to ICS while it was loading or doing something like rooting it before upgrading... or any of the other basic mistakes most people make when they complain about their devices not working properly out of the box.  When I called Asus to troubleshoot, yes - they were nice, but NO they could not recommend any fixes for me but to do a factory reset of the item... which I had already tried 3 times and which made the issues worse.  They told me that I could send it (out of pocket of course) to the Asus repair facility, and it would be 'fixed' but not replaced with a brand new one unless it was truly in a state in which it could not be repaired... so great... best case scenario is that it is completely defective (hardware) or else I just paid full price for a refurbished model... in addition to the fix of replacing the back with the TF700 plastic back to 'improve on' the GPS and WiFi issues... they said they only had grey backs and not the Champagne... so again, great.  It's like bying a red Ferrari and finding out the carbon fiber hood makes the thing slow and clunky, then having them tell you they can replace it with a new plastic Orange hood that doesn't even match the original color.  Anyhow, I've returned my Prime to Amazon for a full refund... and now I see that they've jacked up the price on these by $115????  What a gip... and to find out that Asus is now launching the TF700 series near the end of Q2 with the only real enhancement being the front facing camera going form a 1.2 to 2.0 Mega Pixel and the upgraded screen resolution which is nice, but on a 10 inch. tablet is a bit much and a huge battery drain for an extra $100 that they will be charging for the 16GB model.  I might hold out for the TF700 which I'd recommend anyone cosidering a Prime, but then again for that price, I might just buy an original Transformer TF101 series, and get a docking station all for $350 less.  Asus dropped the ball on this one... and being in Software/Hardware Quality assurance business myself... I can tell you this whole launch reeks of Asus going on a complete money grab with a FUBAR release schedule, numerous missed deadlines, rushed manufacturing process to get these out to meet the demand caused by the buzz, ZERO QA on the machines being pushed out, and then realizing they've failed massively and as a result rushing to launch the TF700 in hopes people will forget what a huge bust the TF Prime was.  If I'm and Apple marketing person, I'm using Asus as prime example on why customers should by an iPad 3 and not believe the hype that other tablets are catching up to them.... and that is hard for me to say being that I'm not a fan of Apple products.  I know even the best company occasionally has a few an occasional issue with one of their products, but I've read so many reviews and similar cases in the transformer/Asus forums that I know this isn't one of those isolated cases.  Again, save your money... go with an original TF101 with docking station for $450 or wait for the TF700 - 16GB for $600... or if you must have a tablet now look at the Samsung Galaxy or something along these lines...", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "ASUS needs to work on it more", "Author": "stjcampisi", "ReviewID": "RH0K5TOY2QHTH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had a Samsung Galaxy tab and thought I was upgrading when I bought my Transformer.

The tablet comes with 6 really bad songs on it for examples. You dont have permission to remove them. You cant get rid of them. I contacted ASUS and was told there is no way to delete them from the tablet. WTF???? I was told to download ASUS sync and use it to delete them. So I did, only ASUS sync does not sync music, it only syncs contacts and calender. What a waste of time. I use Windows Media Player on my computer. It sees the TF 201...sometimes. I usualy have to disconnect and reconnect the tablet several times. When it does it will let me see the music thats stuck on it, it will let me set up a sync from the media player, but when I try to sync it, it starts the first song and just stops. It will just sit there at 0% until it finaly quits and tells me there is an unknown error. With my Galaxy, it was all plug and play and I had no issues with syncing music or video. Ive contacted ASUS several times, and get cut and paste answers that have absolutely no effect.LOCKING UP: My tablet locks up at least once a day, for no apparent reason. I have to hold the power button to restart it. I got a notice that there was a firmware update, it downloaded until it got to 44% and just stopped, it never finished, wouldnt clear, and wouldnt restart. Now it says there is no update.BLUTOOTH: Seriouse delays with this when using video. If you dont mind hearing the words and then seeing them.

The micro hdmi out port provides a useful setup for meetings.The wifi is as good as any other device I own and significantly better than the droid x.  I believe the diversity antennas do a good job.  However the GPS on my unit is completely useless even in wide open outdoor areas. I have set up my phone to tether GPS data to the tabby although I don't utilize it often (ever) for navigation.  UPDATE: ASUS to provide free GPS dongles to all, and improved RF after the C3 models.ICS on this sandwich is awesome, very stable.  Able to multitask seamlessly.  The browser still needs work - I think a high performance mode would be useful. I toggle plugins on demand and tabby does a great job.  The resolution seems more than adequate for me although if a tf201- tf700 upgrade path was made available I might consider it.  ICS kills ad-hoc networking beware.

If it's a camera graphic or gps or bluetooth issue it's stull tolerable. But come on asus people buy tablet to go online. You can't give a go surfing experience don't sell your tablet.

My 32GB Prime finally arrived in early January, and at first I was impressed by the looks, the speed, the immediate update to ICS. But then I tried the GPS.How could they release this otherwise impressive product without making sure the GPS worked? I lay this unit next to my Motorola Droid Bionic phone, with both running the \"GPS Status\" app from Marketplace, and immediately my phone fixes on 7 of 12 satellites, while the Prime just sits there looking pretty. Eventually it finds a couple of satellites but never fixes on any of them. The only way the Prime knows where it's at is to enable the tablet's \"Google Location Services\" which determines location by WiFi. But of course you have to be in WiFi range for that to work, and that's another disappointment, though not as bad as the GPS.As others have noted, WiFi on the Prime seems weak. My Prime indicates one bar less than my phone does in most locations. I will say that if I am getting at least one bar, the WiFi does its job, and browsing is quick and smooth.Three days ago I contacted ASUS through their website regarding the GPS issue but have not heard back.

A quick Google of \"Asus Transformer crashing\" (done on my phone, obviously) revealed this to be a very common problem, one that was supposed to be fixed with the Android Ice Cream Sandwich update, but it still exists. Nvidia was sued by Apple, Dell & HP for CPUs that create this problem, but Asus wasn't part of the settlement and seems to continue its use of this defective hardware.2) The very cool brushed metal housing makes it impossible to use any program or app requiring GPS signal - the metal housing blocks the signal. Asus' response is that this will be fixed -- in the next edition of their tablet.I am returning the Transformer tablet and all the accessories I bought to go with it.

Basically the software does not live up to the hardware specs. Basically what I found was:- Reboot problems: With each firmware updates from Asus, the stability of the tablet has been getting worse and worse. Until finally, after the Feb 20th update, the device would not stay on for more than 30 minutes. I'm not sure if this is an Asus problem or a Google Android problem, but it basically made my table unusable. I would turn on the tablet, and after visiting a few websites (such as amazon.com) the device would reboot. The final straw that broke my back and caused me to return it was I was on the lock screen, slide the lock to open ... and reboot!- Wifi: wifi worked but reception seemed to be very poor in my house. Basically I could only use the device on the same floor where my wifi router was located, anything else, and watching video would not work cleanly. All my other devices have no problem with wifi reception.- GPS: While I would not be using this as a GPS navigation device, the GPS basically would not work.- Speed: I would have thought with a quad core CPU that the device would be fast. But most of the time it could not keep up with my typing speed. Type in a search on Amazon.com and i could complete my search phrase before the first few characters appeared. Waiting for the device to reboot also seemed to take forever.- Crash: the browser would constantly crash on me. Browse Amazon.com ... crash, watch Bloomberg TV ... crash, read Google news ... crash. Basically the browser was not usable, and when trying to use the new Google chrome, because of its lack of support for flash, also not usable.I did not purchase it to play games, but basically to perform business tasks, email, web browsing, watching Bloomberg online TV, but I found myself waiting to see what I was typing, or waiting for it to reboot. It reminded me back of the days of the blue screen of death with Windows, but even worse, at least with Windows I could use a Windows PC for more than 30 minutes without it rebooting.Again, not sure if this is a Google Android issue or Asus firmware/hardware issue, but either way, rather than wasting my time to learn the answer to that question, I decided to return my tablet and find a better alternative.While I am no fan of Apple's closed system, I have used my wife's iPad2 and I have to admit that the software and hardware work much better on her iPad2 than on this device.Comparing both's usefulness:- Boot times seem to be much quicker on the iPad2, boot up is at least twice as fast on the iPad2- Reboot: I have yet to hear of my wife's iPad2 rebooting- Speed: Everything operates much more smoothly on the iPad2- Crashes: I have yet to use my wife's iPad2 and have the browser crash on me.So the fine print on this device should read, \"use at your own risk\".

Some of the software installed on it was also pretty nice (Polaris Office). Overall though, it didn't meet my expectations.I just could not justify spending a little under $700 for the tablet and dock to find out that it didn't work consistently for web in my home under the best of circumstances. That along with the fact that ASUS not only put out a product they knew was faulty to begin with, but had the nerve to show off it's replacement under the same name before the current model was even available. I also thought that the app selection from the android market was pretty poor, especially after the ICS update. It seems as if a lot of apps either didn't work with ICS, or hadn't been optimized for it yet, so they were unavailable in the market.To be honest, I just didn't get the whole 'tablet' thing. I had the keyboard dock which was nice because I didn't have to hold the tablet. It also gave a significant boost to the battery life (the dock has it's own battery).

In most cases, I have been very pleased with the quality and performance of their products.However, two things are pulling me away from buying it: issues with wireless/gps and the price on Amazon stores. In the past, I usually see local retailer prices a bit higher, but on Amazon, the price is considerably higher.Amazon stores are $592-$616 and into the $700's before shipping. Office Depot is selling the prime for $499 with low cost shipping. The link below indicates to expect a change in technology to happen in the next three quarters which could drive the price of the tegra 3's potentially to around $300 - predicted by nVidia makers of the Tegra chips. I would strongly consider the prime sometime in the next month on Amazon if the price comes down to meet what I am seeing at retail stores.Reasons: A new prime model will be working out the GPS/Wireless issues in a couple months (which is just around the corner), Tegra 3 will be available with other competitive brands and Tegra 4 will be possibly released before 4th quarter is out with talk of Android 5 in the fall.[...]", "Date": "January 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Avoid this tablet", "Author": "David W.", "ReviewID": "R1TWNFDEQ3HMM2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered two of these, and they arrived in the latter part of January.One worked fine, the other was dead on arrival.The functional one seems to work quite nicely (our Broadband Internet service is challenged enough that Wireless issues haven't surfaced, or at least not yet).

I absolutely love this tablet!!  I have owed IPAD2 and Xoom in the past.  I have had experience with several other 10inch and 7 inch pads, mostly Samsung.This tablet stands on its own.  It is sleek, fast, and brilliant all in one.  I updated the operating system from Honeycomb to ICS.  I was a tablet owner through all of Honeycombs ups and downs last year, so I didn't expect much from ICS.  However, ICS is great!  To the average user, there are only minor noticeable changes.  Such as menu setup, the file system, and a few extra features.  However, it seems more stable.  I did experience force closes (allot) while using my apps.  However, many apps have not been ported to ICS yet.  So I cannot judge the device on that.Back to the device:  After experiencing the IPAD2's horrible camera, this was one of the first features I wanted to test.  The rear camera is 8mps and does an excellent job of capturing still photos (I did not try it on moving subjects).  There is very little pixilation.  In fact the only time I noticed pixilation is if I used the zoom function to take a photo.  There is also an awesome photo editing feature onboard.  I like it much better than the one on my ipad 2.The device is much lighter than my ipad 2 and very slim.  It also feels very solid.  The only external buttons are the volume rocker and the power on button.I did not get to test the power of the tegra 3 chip. When I updated to ICS, the boat racing game that comes with it disappeared.I did notice some GPS problems and WIFI issues.  The GPS signal would drop every so often and the devices location based apps would stop working.  What bothered me the most though was the WIFI signal?  I could not get the tablets to read more than one bar, no matter where I sat in vicinity of my wireless router.  I was running my IPAD 2 at the same time and it was getting full signal.Sadly, I did return my Transformer Prime the same day.  It has nothing to do with the device itself, but everything to do with the Android Market.  Although Android has this great tablet now (one that finally beats IPAD), without any apps what is the point.  I figure the reason you have a tablet is to use apps, but the Android market place has like 100 apps for tablets...What is up with that?Anyways, if you do not like apps and entertainment, get this tablet!

Fortunately the second time I pre-order they come through and actually got it to me before the estimated shipping date.ABOUT THE PRIME:Unboxing I found that there's really not all that much included aside from power adapter and charging USB data cable for the tablet.  There's a screen cleaning cloth and a small user manual, but that's it.  Something I sort of expected in the box which was not there was the port to microHDMI, which apparently can only be done if you buy the dock.  One note about the tablet after unboxing is that my battery was completely dead and needed to be charged for 3-4 hours until fully charged before turning on for the first time.  Minor convenience, but this needs to be done to fully calibrate the battery and allow the battery to discharge properly to ensure you're getting the longest battery life possible.The initial reaction was how thin the tablet is.  It's got a great looking glass screen and a nice aluminum back that will be nice to hide any scratches if you use this sans-case.  While it adds some weight, I like knowing that the tablet by itself is durable.  The only downside is that the buttons are a little hard to press since they don't stick out that much but it may just take some getting used to.  Hey I'm reaching for straws here, the rest of this tablet is so out of this world, there's not much to complain about.  Oh maybe the glass being to reflective, but with the SuperIPS+ turned on, you can't see any sort of reflection whatsoever, even in full sunlight outdoors!In terms of performance, this tablet is blazing fast running on Tegra 3.  With an easy performance mode switcher built-in to the notification window, it's super easy to change from power-saving, to balanced, to performance modes for easy reading to gaming.  I run the security software Lookout in the background and never know it's there.  With 1GB of RAM and 40+ apps installed, it only seems to use up to 400MB leaving plenty of headroom in memory.  The 32GB of internal memory has been plenty of space to install apps, about a thousand mp3s and about 10 HD movies (1080p, mp4, 2000Kbps).  Video quality is absolutely flawless when using this format at 1080p and just looks incredible with SuperIPS+ turned on to get the bright whites and dark blacks.Battery life has been about average with the iPad running at about 10-12 hours or so when playing music and light usage like checking email.Camera quality is acceptable, probably great for most people... I mean as good as a fixed lens, small sensor, cell/tablet camera.  High megapixels, but more importantly is fairly accurate color interpretation and a nice bright LED flash for objects in the 10ft. range for low-light.  The video is just as good and it's nice to be able to film in 1080p.The couple annoyances I've seen thus far are mostly in regards to Android 3.2 Honeycomb, which won't really matter after January 12th when ASUS has stated they'll release Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich update for the tablet.  This review may need updating as Android 4.0 is really meant for tablets, Honeycomb was more of a testing platform.  The other annoyance is the ASUS keyboard, which is easily switched back to the default Android, which I find a little easier to use, faster, and doesn't crash/freeze like the ASUS keyboard does.Overall I love this tablet, size is perfect, beautiful screen, fast processor, lots of storage, great price, longest battery life of Android tablets, one of the first tablets to run Android 4.0, for $499 I'm not sure you'll find a better tablet.  No, not even the iPad2.Just a side note for Amazon.com:1. STOP placeholder reviews (DO NOT ALLOW REVIEWS BEFORE PRODUCT IS RELEASED!)2. DO NOT CANCEL pre-orders until you know for sure you aren't receiving any stock ever again, if the quantity is reduced or shipment delayed, give your customers the option of keeping their pre-order until it can be fulfilled.3.

I'm sitting 6 feet away from an 802.1n Wifi Router, which works beautifully and flawlessly with EVERY OTHER wifi item I own, including both my android phones, my Kindle Fire, my HP laptops, our wireless printers, etc-- works great with everything EXCEPT the Transformer Prime. Sitting here, 6 feet away, it TELLS me that it has a 65-75Mbps connection to the Internet but it times out so horribly that its practically impossible to use. Sitting in my office, which is perhaps 30 feet away, I get 5-26Mbps connections, which sometimes work. For small things, like fetching web pages or short downloads, its not too bad. For longer things, it can get pretty bad.There are some supposed \"FIXES\" for the wifi issue (Google \"Transformer Prime Wifi Fix\" for a YouTube video, for example). I tried the fix, and it DOES improve things temporarily, but eventually the issues return and the performance is terrible again.GPS:When I tried out the GPS in my car, I could not get any satellite reception. The GPS simply did not register. I thought perhaps it was broken, but I have since seen it actually work a few times so I know there is technically nothing electrically wrong with it, but rather it is just poor reception via the antenna.BATTERY LIFE:Asus claims hours and hours of battery life for the tablet (I don't yet have a keyboard dock). But I have yet to see it. In general use, I seem to get two or three hours between charges. Frankly, I'm not impressed AT ALL with the battery life. Its enough to be useful, and by itself I would not return the unit because of it-- but it IS bothersome enough that I think Asus oughta get slapped with a suit for false claims regarding it. That was one of the key selling features that sold me on this unit.WELL, ASIDE FROM THAT MRS LINCOLN...Aside from these two SHOW-STOPPING issues and ONE BOTHERSOME item, the rest of the unit seems nice enough. I mostly like it. The screen is nice, it's generally responsive, but I cannot say I would rave about it. I may simply return it and try an IPAD2. I've never tried one before, but I know a lot of people seem to like them. Frankly, if the Kindle Fire had cameras and GPS, I would prefer it over the Transformer Prime-- based on my experience with both. The Kindle is heavier and smaller, but it has good battery life, a nice enough screen, and wifi is very good. I have *never* experienced any problems with the Kindle. I am kind of disappointed in the Transformer Prime. I've been waiting for it since October-- it was supposed to have been my Christmas present, and then didn't come out in time-- which is why I have the Kindle, to \"hold me over\", and then it was my birthday present-- but I think it is mainly an expensive flop.", "Date": "February 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best tablet out", "Author": "Abdul kareem", "ReviewID": "RNM23EZ9RZPEB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Putting GPS issue aside this is the best tablet out.

The little pauses and lagginess mostly disappeared. I don't know why I hadn't tried this mode, oh yeah, it was because of battery concerns and yes the Prime did die on me today after enabling performance mode even though I barely touched it today. Since I will get the docking station soon then this is not a concern. When I bought the original TF I made a review for the dock saying it was necessary to fully enjoy the TF if you used it all day like me. Now with performance mode I would say the dock is obligatory if you want to use performance mode which you should, otherwise wy buy a Tegra 3 tablet. Let's see how it behaves when the dock arrives. Changed from 4 stars to 5 stars*********************************************ORIGINAL REVIEW:My Transformer Prime just crashed and rebooted so I have like a minute to write this review...Ok it's back up, that was fast but... I might as well finish the review.I'm an Android fan, a Transformer fan, maybe even an ASUS fan. When people talk about Android tablets they always say the Galaxy Tab, the Xoom blah blah, they never mention the ASUS Transformer which was the best and most innovating tablet bar none. I guess this is because people know samsung and Motorola (and LG and HTC, etc) from their phones. ASUS doesn't make phones so it's in a disadvantage there but if you know anything about computer parts then you know ASUS is a pretty big and trustworthy company. They make awesome video cards, awesome mother boards, awesome laptops and a lot more stuff.I bought the Original Transformer knowing and trusting ASUS completely, I imagine a lot of people dismissed it because they thought ASUS was some crazy crappy company like Coby or Pandigital. What I mean is ASUS is a huge successful company, not some weird newcomer.The original Transformer was awesome, actually it is awesome, ASUS delivered fast updates and it worked great. Of course when I heard about the prime I had to have it so I sold the original Transformer and I went through the whole nowinstock ordeal, I pre ordered it here and there and then cancelled here and was charged there so had to wait for the funds to be available to pre order it somewhere else and then finally I was able to preorder it at Amazon and it said it would arrive Jan 27 - Feb 10 and then I got an email from Amazon saying hey good news! Your order will arrive sooner, like in 2 days and bam immediate $500 dollar charge but I didn't have the money ready so overdraft fee blah blah. So finally I got my prime like Jan 21 because I don't live in the US.FIRST IMPRESSIONS: When I opened it up I didn't get the wow factor, looks pretty normal to me. Booted up and honeycomb was kinda laggy. I upgraded to ICS and it's snappier in general but it still seems laggy to me in some things like selecting options, for example I enable bluetooth... wait a sec... then I get the notification. I select a recent app... wait a sec... app opens and stuff like that.COMPARED TO OG TF: I restored my backup from the original Transformer which was almost 200 apps so I guess this could make the tablet laggy but the thing is the old transformer worked just fine. Don't get me wrong, the Transformer Prime is a good experience, it's a good tablet, I just don't feel the difference compared to the original Transformer. If before I had 2 cores and now I have 4+1, why does it feel a little slower? You know what I mean? If it was super easy to sell the old one and buy the new one it would be different but to get a Champagne Prime at retail price is hard and I'm not sure it was worth it, now I don't have the keyboard dock which is annoying but I was finally able to order it from Tigerdirect so I'm waiting for it to arrive.WIFI? GPS? Who cares about GPS in a wifi Tablet? Seriously? Wifi to me has been choppy. Works fine next to the router obviously but not so much in my room but the OG transformer didn't work so well in the room either, we have thick brick walls here so that sucks.SHOULD YOU WAIT FOR THE IPAD3? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO what is wrong with you people? If the Prime was a disappointment to you for some reason that doesn't mean you have to go to crapple!! The OG Transformer is available, other tablets are available, more tablets will come besides people are more likely to write a review if they want to complain about something so count each good review as double or triple.CRASHES: My apps very rarely crash and the Prime never crashed until today while I was trying to watch a Youtube video and I use all day all the time.IS IT REALLY SLOWER THAN THE OG TF? This is a Tegra 3 so if you used a T3 optimized app like the jetski game that splashes the screen n stuff I'm sure it will run great and it won't run on the original TF (Or it won't run the same). But for general use like scrolling around, looking at widgets and opening my usual apps like Netfix, Pulse, Cnet TV, Doggcatcher, Youtube, etc it doesn't feel faster to me.WHY DON'T YOU RETURN IT? It's not easy for me to return stuff since I'm not in the US. I still wouldn't return it because I don't want to go back and then I stumble upon a Tegra 3 only app that I can't get cause I went back. Also the prime is lighter and thinner and prettier, I finally ordered the dock so... I might as well keep it. Besides when the TF700 comes out it and if it works well I could probably sell the Prime and get that one.FINAL WORDS: The prime has issues but it's a good machine. You might be satisfied with the OG Prime which is a hundred bucks cheaper and the dock is now also cheaper, maybe you can find one in a store to play around with. Besides ASUS has announced that ICS is coming soon to the OG TF. I've had many Android devices and this is stuff you live with if you want to be free. I'd rather have one crash a month and wifi a little slow then to live in a little cube where crapple dictates your life, that's just pathetic.", "Date": "January 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Important in regards to release date...", "Author": "M.

I got 5 hours to a charge on the normal setting with the brightness turned all the way down (I did not use the balanced or power save mode because what is the point of having 4 cores if you don't use them?). I downloaded an app to conserve my battery life when the screen was locked (something was draining my battery all the way to dead during the night) but it would turn off wi-fi when the screen was off but would not turn it back on when the screen was turned on despite the fact that I had it set to do so.Wi-fi - my Prime would consistently lose wifi signal requiring me to reboot it (which takes about an entire minute to do)Size - the 10.1\" screen is just too large to type on using just my thumbs (although there is a thumbs only keyboard that solves this and the swype keyboard can be resized and positioned in the corner of the screen)It also shows fingerprints WAY to much and would not turn on for me the second morning I owned it requiring me to reset it by putting a pin in the reset hole.Google's problems...While not ASUS' fault necessarily, I must mention Android's faults as the two go hand-in-hand.App store - I had trouble finding good apps using common term searches (e.g. \"to-do list\"). The only way I found that I could find the best apps was to perform a google search and then find the name of the app and search for it in the marketplace.Unresponsive apps - force closing and freezing apps is never a good sign.Lack of tablet apps - I had trouble finding good apps designed for tablets.

I pre-ordered this and was content to wait until it delivered in mid February... until I read a few days ago that Asus is already coming out with another Asus Prime (700 series) to compensate for this one's poor design (spun by the company as an enhanced design to boost the wifi and gps). This is why, much to my dismay, I don't think any of these companies are going to supplant apple. They rush their products out to market without thought and deliberation. It's sad too, because they would have had my business if they'd done it right the first time. Now with the news that the Ipad 3 will have a micro sd slot (a MAJOR selling point for me initially pre-ordering the Prime), I am content to wait a few more months and get the Ipad 3.

To put it simply: they have made me detest the very concept of tablets. I played with this tablet for 30 minutes and fell in love. It was the perfect Christmas gift for myself for all the hours I've been putting in but to my surprise, all those hours came to bite me in the arse. I get home one day and read news of preorders available. Product pages with active order options suddenly disappear from nearly every online retailer.Well not all. I found one after much scavenging of the internets and preordered a 32 GB model on the 26th of November, only to discover TODAY that the retailer's stock would not come in until January 8th.So thank you, Amazon, for lowering the expectation of shipment date and preventing any further orders when the supply did not meet the demand. Customers who expected a timely shipment of their units received $10 gift card codes and were given an adjusted shipment date while others who were of the first fortunate batch have already received their Primes.
