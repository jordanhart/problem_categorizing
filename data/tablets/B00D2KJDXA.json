[...]For those who are looking at getting the best tablet out there at the moment, this is the one you should be looking at.My profile: Heavy tablet users for personal and business purposes.  I work on my tablet around 4-5 hours a day (Email / Documents / Spreadsheet / PDF ) and use it 1-2 hours for personal use such as watching movies or reading books/magazine.  Tablet is my go-to device for all internet related search I do.I have the following and/or used the following before:1) iPad 12) iPad 23) iPad 44) iPad Mini5) Kindle Fire6) Kindle Fire HD7) Kindle Fire HD 8.98) Asus Transformer with Keyboard9) Nexus 7 First Gen10) iPad Air 16gb WifiAs you can see, I been through many devices and hope this review with my experience helps users decide if this is the right device for them. This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this next year.  For comparison sake, I will use last year's Kindle and iPad mini as they are the closest size to this HDX 7\"Speed (9/10):This is leaps and bounds faster than last year Kindle HD.  Last year Kindle struggles to go through any HD video content I put in.  This year's HDX able to play seamlessly all the HD 1080p contents I added.  It is incredible how much the 2.2Ghz quad processor improved vs last year's model Dual 1.2Ghz.Screen (9/10):This is the biggest improvement over last year's model.  The screen is in true HD 1080p (1920x1080).  This means any HD content I throw at it will view in its intended resolution.  The screen is crystal clear (much better than iPad mini) and the viewing angle is incredible.  I have this Kindle hanged in the middle of the car and at any seat it is view very clearly.  Last year's model was not as clear as this.  This is excellent for my minivan with my kids watching all the HD movies.  The brightness of the screen is also much brighter than last year's modelSound(8/10):The sound system in this Kindle Fire HDX is using Dolby Digital Plus with virtual 5.1 surround sound.  That gives this device a much better surround sound then previous generation's.Build (8/10):This HDX is more \"angular\" than last year's device.  It's slightly rougher to hold in the corners than last year's model due to sharper edges though I doubt any users will hold their tablet by their corners.  The device is noticeable lighter (395g for Kindle Fire HD vs 303g for Kindle Fire HDX).  This mean you can hold this for longer time without fatigue.The power and volume button placement on this Kindle Fire HDX is interesting.  It is behind the device which allows it to hide away from front view.  However, this can cause user to accidentally hit the on/off button or the volume button when not being careful.  Aesthetically it is great but it is definitely not a practical solution when you are trying to use this on the go.It does look sturdy enough to survive minor drop but I highly recommend getting a case for it.  Those sharp corners seems more prone to dents than round corners for last year's model.Battery (6/10):This is probably the biggest drawback for this device.  The battery life is not as good as last year's model.  This is quite logical as last year's HD has a 4400mAh battery while running 720p while this HDX runs Full HD 1080p but runs only on a 4500mAh battery (only 100mAh more than last year).  The 1080p screen pulls a lot of power vs last year's model when the screen is on, especially when running HD videos.  I'm able to achieve 5 hours of heavy use compare to 7 hours for last year's Kindle Fire HD at medium brightness with Wi-fi on all the time.  I tend to bring around an external battery pack but prefer something that is integrated (like a battery case)Software & software compatibility (8/10):The amount of app is still lacking compare to App store or Play store but has been steadily increasing which is a great sign. Games and software boot time has increased noticeably and compatibility is not an issueSilk browser has definitely improved compare to last year's tablet with multiple tabs actually now usable on the HDX.  For last year's version, it is practically unusable after 2 tabs due to the lack of hardware resource on the tablet (especially when the website is not optimized for mobile use).  The HDX has no problem going through any webpages I throw at it.Hopefully more apps will be optimized to use quad core soon.  I'm guessing some of these apps are only optimized for last year's dual core.I haven't got the opportunity to use Mayday yet but will review about it once I get more update on this.Complimentary Accessories (3/10):For all smart devices, one of the most important time is the number of accessories available.  At launch, it is understandable the lack of accessories but productivity focus accessories such as integrated case/keyboard are missing at launch.  This is rather disappointing as it can be a powerful productivity device with the right accessories attached.  Also the lack of case selection is quite astonishing for a flagship product on Amazon.  Hope there will be more cases such as battery case (due to above battery problem) or rugged case come out soon.Price (9/10):I got the special offer model at 16Gb (lowest end model) and it is enough for me to use.  The special offer ads are not intrusive like last year's model and sometimes does reveal some items I want. Compare to the ipad mini, this is practically a steal.  For those with the Nexus 7, it is quite comparable in price.Conclusion in one sentence: Amazon's iPad mini killer (8.5/10)For people who are justifying if this is a good upgrade, I say YES to that.  The speed and screen difference alone is worth the upgrade.  The whole user experience just improve drastically with the HDX.It use to be, for Kindle Fire HD, you will trade low price for slow performance, stutter and lag.  It honestly makes you think twice if the price is really worth all that poor experience.For HDX, this is no longer the case.  You get both great price, great screen and great performance that surpasses iPad mini. To me, the HDX is seriously Amazon's iPad killer.  It really marks how well Amazon has done to make themselves a worthy competitor in the tablet market. I hope some software upgrade or battery pack can make this the ultimate road warrior!****************************Dec 23th 2013 - 2 months  update *********************************So I have been using between this HDX 7\" and the 8.9\" HDX.  I also been using an iPad Air 16Gb Wifi and here are some updates, particular on the negative points mentioned previously.App Store - not so refined still.  Downloading and Installing problem occursThe app store after 2 month is still a bit lacking.  There are some freebie deals during cyber monday which I jumped (who doesn't like free stuff?)but still nothing that either the Apple App store or Google Play don't have.  Amazon App store really needs some exclusive apps to become a \"must get\" device.Now comes the bad part - I tried to download Magic 2014 game (big fan of Magic the Gathering since teen) from the Amazon App Store and the HDX 7\" downloads this rather slowly.  In fact, I noticed that when it reaches 50% it drops back down to 30% and redownloads the package again!  Since I'm not in a rush I really have no issue with this re-download problem.  However, this can be problem to some people who have limited bandwidth per month and won't appreciate redownloading the same thing again 2 times (or more but I didn't catch that).Once it reaches 100%, the app store attempts to install the software.  It goes into \"Installing...\" state for a while (at least couple hours).  Knowing that there's something weird going on, I rebooted the HDX 7\".  Once I rebooted it, the software shows it was never downloaded!Perhaps there's some application specific problem with this game but this really shows a rather poor experience on the Amazon Kindle Fire HDX.  I would expect a brand new top of the line Kindle Fire HDX would have ironed out simple bugs such as this but clearly, the Amazon App Store have 2 things it needs to work on:1) If this is an application specific error, Amazon needs to proactively test this release on all their devices before allowing it on the Amazon App Store.  It's quite obvious if any Amazon App store guys have even tried to install this Magic 2014 game that it just won't install.  Literally half the reviews on the review complain about this2) For these buggy release, Amazon should proactively pull this application from the store - the experience that lead to all the hours of download and wasted bandwidth got the user nothing in the end.  I can imagine some users with capped bandwidth or using their cell data to download will be furious if they know an app less than 1Gb rack them couple Gb of download.App Store is a big part of Amazon's Kindle Fire ecosystem and poor experience such as this really deters client in continued use, especially when all Kindle Fire are locked down to Amazon software ecosystem.  When you cannot even use the Amazon software ecosystem, any excellent hardware that this machine has becomes inaccessible and worse of all, a waste of user time to figure out.Now most people may say this criticism is related to the game(in this case, Magic 2014).  I believe this is not the case.  The responsibility of Downloading and Installing of the Magic 2014 application belongs to the Amazon App Store (after all, it is Amazon App Store people who authorized this to be released in their store). I start to find all other game download and installation questionable and my own usage time in App store browsing and purchasing drops drastically.From the above download experience, I did attempt to find some help from Amazon.  Here is where the more problem arises.Mayday - speaking to rep reading off outdated troubleshooting guidesAfter noticing my Magic 2014 download is gone, I attempted to contact Amazon through the Mayday button.  It's really my first time using this function so I don't really have any prior experience in using it.My Mayday call was picked up by Hayley (if I recall).  You can see a big Amazon logo in the background beside the customer service rep and she looks pretty friendly.  I explained my situation with the App store problem to Hayley but it seems she wasn't able to help; therefore I got transfer to a \"Tech Advisor\".  This Tech Advisor can't be shown in the video camera and asks for my credentials.  She also made me explain the problem again which I explained to Hayley (I would have thought someone will note down my problem as I need to use couple mins to explain again).  She then pulls something that you expect from an Indian Call Center by asking me to disconnect my internet modem.  I find this rather funny as I mentioned this is a software specific problem with the installation and has nothing to do with my modem or Internet connection.  I also mentioned that I am running a server at home and pulling the modem disconnects it from the Internet which breaks other services I am running unintentionally.  She seems to be stuck so she forward me to another representative (which if I heard correctly, it is the app store support rep).Once I got connected to the 3rd rep, they ask me to check my tablet date and time (which is correct).  This rep later ask me to press on options that are not the screen.  I suspected this rep was reading off an old Fire OS troubleshooting guide as I recently updated the Fire OS system and that some options and buttons are changed.  Given the large amount of time spent and there's no resolution, I went to my iPad air and downloaded the game successfully in couple mins while still have Amazon on the Mayday call.  I informed the 3rd tech support of this and thank them for their time although there was no resolution in the end.I very much prefer having the game on my Kindle HDX as the 7\" is perfect to bring outside for quick game or two, but the amount of time spent on troubleshooting and resource wasted on this is honestly not worth my time.  I ended up having to play this game on the iPad Air larger screen but also paid for in app purchase because the game itself is very good.It's a good lesson to learn that the whole software user experience needs to be more streamline and fluid on the Kindle.  Amazon has done successfully in the physical good purchasing section of the kindle fire (in fact I spent thousands of dollars more on Amazon.com using the kindle fire than on PC and very satisfy with the results) and that if it can bring the same experience to the software app store just like the physical store, Amazon will have a winner here. I use my machine extensively for magazine reading / internet browsing but when it comes to app download, I currently have my doubts if it will be another bandwidth hog and a waste of time.Display - blue hue appears but not very apparentSome people ask if the blue hue appears on the edge.  I can notice this if I'm reading off a totally white page (like a ebook or magazine).  However it is not very noticeable and that your eyes will ignore it eventually.  After all, words or graphic don't appear on the edges of the screen.Battery life - Still needs work onAfter the OS update, there seems to be a slight improvement with the battery life.  However, still not enough for me to really go through the day without bringing an external battery charger pack along.  At the moment, I am still looking for a 2 in 1 case + battery solution but it is not available.  I hope this can be my daily driver but without the battery life, it may just be a brick by the afternoon.Purchasing on Amazon.com - becomes addictive (Could be good or bad for some people!)I realized my spending on Amazon went up considerable compare to last year thanks to this Kindle Fire HDX.  I will be browsing it online and have these items saved on screen, constantly reminding me to get it.  Amazon really done a good job at this and really met, if not, exceed their goal in getting users buying from kindle fire.  With last year fire, the browsing experience on Amazon.com was not nearly as fluid as this year's HDX.  This makes it hard to keep my attention and urge to buy.  For people who wants a good purchasing experience, this Kindle Fire HDX will surely provide that.  For ones who need to save money, you may want to get your finger off the buy button!My overall rating stays the same as Amazon keeps knocking off prices for these machines making it still the best bang for the buck.Apr 28 Update - Family Use----------------------------------------------Got my kids an extra Kindle Fire HDX 7\" for them to play with.  My HDX 7\" is still running well with all my Instant Video and newsstand subscription inside.Since my kids don't treat their new toys with much care, I went and got them and myself a zerolemon EVA Case on Amazon.  The case is useful for prevent dents and major falls on your Kindle.  Even with my Kindle, the top pantel where the speakers are started to peel off a bit (amazon used glue to assemble the speaker grille top panel).  Case works great for hiding some of the blemishes of the kindle fire hdx 7\"Overall still satisfied with my machine and frankly been the best bang for the buck tablet i ever have.As mentioned, I will update this review periodically.  Next time I will focus on physical wear and tear of the machine after couple more months and again on battery life (as all electronics have a diminishing battery duration throughout its course of use). [...] Thanks for reading!", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent 3rd-generation tablet that compares favorably to the competition", "Author": "NF", "ReviewID": "R2KVHBC7NMNOGU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the middle model of the three models that Amazon is shipping this year: the Kindle Fire HD, the Kindle Fire HDX (this tablet), and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\". This is the successor for last year's Kindle Fire HD but with an updated operating system and new features, a redesigned shell (with the power and volume control buttons more readily accessible), an absolutely amazing display, superb sound, an included power adapter, and the new Mayday feature. See http://www.amazon.com/review/RNH700DOM9WN3/ for my review of the Kindle Fire HD and http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YPITHVTYLCZT for my review of the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\".Update: Some users are reporting a bluish glow around the edges of the screen for the HDX. If you search on YouTube for HDX Blue Haze, you can find a video showing the issue. Amazon has updated their \"Learn More\" link with the following info:\"To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7\" at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20% improvement in power efficiency.\"\"As a result of using these blue LEDs, you may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. All displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy.\"If this is something that you think would bother you, I'd recommend taking a look at the YouTube video or taking a look at the HDX at a local Best Buy or office superstore. I've also uploaded a user image here of my HDX with a book loaded so that you can see the blue glow (http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B00DOPNO4M/).The Amazon tablets are primarily content consumption devices, best suited for connecting to the Amazon ecosystem, including videos, music, books, apps, and so on. With the free Prime trial subscription, you can check out the Prime Instant Video options and watch movies and shows at no charge for 30 days. For videos, music, and books, the Amazon selection is at or near the top of the list; for apps, much less so. 90% of the top 100 apps are available on Amazon.com, as well as 100,000 others, but that's only a small fraction of what is available with Google or Apple.It's not quite as bad as it sounds because, while the competition has ten times as many apps, most of those apps are, um ... how shall I put this ... less than stellar (look up Sturgeon's Law). If there are specific apps you need or want, you definitely should double-check before purchasing to make sure that they are available. The apps that will likely never become available on the Kindle Fire ecosystem are those apps that require Google services (i.e., anything that uses Google location services). One ameloriating factor is that it is possible to side-load most of the apps from the Google Play store onto an Amazon tablet and a web search on side-loading apps onto Kindle Fire will show dozens of websites with detailed instructions. If the app you are sideloading requires a Google service to work, though, it will not run on the Fire, even if you manage to successfully install it.Like the other Kindle Fire tablets, as well as the Apple iPad and the Google Nexus, the Kindle tablet line doesn't have a micro-SD slot, so the assumption is that you're consuming content from the cloud. This is fine when you're using your tablet with wifi; not so good when you're traveling and want to load up your tablet with content for the trip. If the latter is something you expect to do regularly, you might want to consider the 32GB or 64GB versions, or pay the additional price for the 4G version, which is available on the 7\" tablet for the first time. Also, if all of your content is on iTunes or on Google Play, you would have to side-load everything onto the tablet. As is true of Apple and Google tablets, there's no way to automatically connect to the cloud storage of the competition.Something new this year is the ability to download Prime Instant Videos. I verified that I can download Prime Instant Videos to my Kindle Fire HDX. However, that option is not available for all movies and TV shows. It looks like they had to get the permission of the studios and not all of them said yes. So, for example, I was able to download \"Casablanca\" but not able to download \"The Avengers\" even though both are part of the Prime Instant Video collection and both are available for free streaming.Update: Adding a bit from a reply in the comments: Amazon is clearly looking at the Enterprise market with this launch, at least based on the details they provide. They've added full accessibility support (required in order to get government contracts), will be bringing support for VPN and business printing, have a better email client with tighter integration to Exchange, and are including OfficeSuite for productivity. There are other productivity tools available in their app store, as well, although both Google and Apple, particularly the latter, have more options. When VPN support arrives, I'll definitely be taking a look, as it would be nice to not have to lug my laptop home every night.So how does this Kindle Fire HDX differ from the previous generation Kindle Fire HD?Display: 1920x1200 (323 ppi) vs 1280x800 (216 ppi). It's more than that, though, as the colors are richer, brighter, with better contrast. This display has been judged by many reviewers as the best in its class and I would have to agree. Amazon has also added technology to automatically adjust the contrast and brightness when viewing the tablet in bright sunlight. While there is definitely a noticeable improvement, this isn't what you need for reading on the beach. For that, you'll need an eInk reader like the Kindle Paperwhite.Sound: As far as I can tell, the sound is about the same. This was already one of the best-sounding tablets on the market, with Dolby stereo output and enough power to actually make it possible to listen to music or video without requiring headphones.Size and Weight: Noticeably lighter (10.7 oz vs. 13.9 oz) and noticeably smaller (7.3\" x 5.0\" x 0.35\" vs. 7.6\" x 5.4\" x 0.4\"). This is a comfortable tablet to hold one-handed, even for long periods of time.Processor: It's a *lot* faster (2.2GHz quad-core, top-of-the-line CPU, compared to 1.2GHz dual-core). This tablet is amazingly fast and smooth, with the fastest processor in its class. Every game I've tried on it has run smoothly, with no hesitations, slowdowns, or glitches. Scrolling through content is amazingly smooth and fast now, without the hesitations and occasional slowdowns of the previous generations.Build: A redesigned shell with power and volume control buttons that are easy to find! This is a solid build but the back of the shell is something of a fingerprint magnet. Since most of us will be buying a case to put the tablet in, that may not be an issue.Camera: If there is a difference between last year's camera and this year's, I'm not able to see it. It's a high-def camera suitable for video-conferencing or Skype. Like last year's model, there is no rear camera. If this is important to you, you'll need the 8.9\" version.HDMI Output: This is the one area where last year's model wins. Amazon has removed the HDMI out connector from its tablet line (but see the description above for details on how Amazon is providing a software solution for sharing your tablet screen on your television). No other tablet that I'm aware of has this functionality so if this is something you need, you should be able to purchase one of last year's models fairly cheaply.Battery Life: The same, at 11 hours. However, Amazon has added a special \"reading mode\" to the device, which they claim will extend the battery life to as much as 17 hours. I did not test this. For my own personal use, the battery life is adequate.Price: It's more expensive ($229 vs. $199) but this year they include a power adapter, which was a $20 extra last year, so the actual difference in price is $10. For what you're getting, that price increase is definitely justified.It has an updated OS and updated feature software (including the free unlimited Mayday customer support feature). The software updates include the ability to download some Prime Instant Videos to your device and watch them offline, enhanced accessibility, enhanced enterprise controls and features (so now it's better suited for office work), enhanced email client, enhanced parental controls, improved X-Ray features (now including lyrics for music, as well as additional information for both books and movies), integration with GoodReads (coming soon), and the like.Where I noticed the biggest difference was the home screen. The default view is still the carousel but if you swipe upward, you'll see a more traditional icon view. The \"Recommended for you\" display on the home screen is now smaller and much less obtrusive (and it can be turned off in the settings). Amazon has also added multi-tasking of a sort, where swiping up from the bottom of the screen while you're in an app shows you the 20 most-recently-used items from your home screen, so you can quickly switch from one app to another without returning to the home screen.There is also a left panel available on most screens (but not the home screen) and in some of the apps, with navigation links and settings to make it easier to navigate and control your tablet or to navigate within the app. If you tap the center of your display and then swipe left while you're reading a book, for example, you'll see a panel that shows you the table of contents, the About the Author link, the Sync to Furthest Page Read link, and so on.The Kindle FreeTime option and the parental controls are still among the best in the business. If you want a tablet for a child and want to control what they can access, how long they can use the tablet at any given time, and the like, Amazon has you covered.You can now also schedule \"Quiet Time\" on the tablet, where notification sounds and pop-up notifications are disabled, either on a temporary basis by simply pushing a button or on a scheduled basis. Frankly, I doubt I'll ever use this feature but if you're the type who likes to read or watch video until you fall asleep, it's kind of nice to be able to disable all sounds so that you don't get rudely awakened when, e.g., someone plays a new word in your Words with Friends game.Mayday: This is a huge gamble by Amazon and it will be interesting to see whether it pays off. This isn't a feature for a techie like me and I didn't use it (although I was sorely tempted). From the commercials, it's pretty amazing, particularly that you can get a live chat in a matter of a minute or less (Amazon's goal is something like 15 seconds, I believe, although I can't help wondering what will happen on Christmas Day!). If you're thinking of getting a tablet for a technophobe, the addition of this feature may make the Kindle Fire HDX your best choice.How does this tablet rank against the competition? There are really only two other tablets in its class currently: the Google Nexus 7 and the just-announced Apple iPad Mini with Retina Display.Display: All three devices have retina displays, with the 7\" HDX and the Nexus at 1920x1200 (323 ppi) and the 8\" iPad Mini at 2048x1536 (326 ppi). All three displays are stunning. Amazon claims that it has enhanced the ability to read the display in bright sunlight, something that's a problem for all such devices. While this wouldn't be my first choice to read by the pool (I'd pick the Paperwhite), I can testify that it is easier to view the display in bright sunlight than its predecessors.It's worth noting that the aspect ratio of the HDX and Nexus is 16:10 while the aspect ratio of the iPad Mini is 4:3. Where this matters is watching video. If you're watching an old television show, a 4:3 aspect ratio is fine. If you're watching a high-def movie, the 4:3 aspect ratio is going to leave large black bars on your screen and the video will be much more compressed than it would be on the HDX and Nexus. Apple chose to maintain backward compatibility with prior devices rather than moving up.Sound: The HDX has Dolby Digital Surround Sound; the Nexus has Frauenhofer Surround Sound; the iPad Mini has stereo sound. The iPad Mini also makes the same mistake that Amazon made in its first-generation tablet: putting both speakers on the same side (in this case, at the bottom of the tablet). If you're watching a video, you'll have the tablet turned sideways and the sound will all come from the same side. The HDX, in contrast, has the speakers placed perfectly for video watching.Networking: The HDX and the iPad Mini both have dual band, dual antenna (MIMO) Wi-Fi. The Nexus is dual band but not dual antenna. All things being equal, I would expect the Nexus to lag a bit behind the others in networking performance, particularly in areas where the connection is spotty.Size and Weight:HDX: 7.3\" x 5.0\" x 0.35\" and 10.7 oz.Nexus: 7.9\" x 4.5\" x 0.34\" and 10.24 oz.iPad Mini: 7.87\" x 5.3\" x 0.29\" and 11.68 oz.There's really nothing to choose from here. All three are small, thin, and light. The iPad Mini is the heaviest but it also has a slightly larger screen.Processor:HDX: 2.2 GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor, 2GB memoryNexus: 1.5GHz quad-core Snapdragon S4 Pro, 2GB memoryiPad Mini: 64-bit dual-core A7, 1GB memoryThe HDX and iPad come out ahead of the Nexus on processing power while the HDX and Nexus come out ahead of the iPad Mini on memory. The A7 is only a dual-core processor but according to some tech sites that have run benchmarks, it definitely holds its own against the quad-core Snapdragon. These are all pretty powerful tablets.Cameras: Both the Nexus and the iPad Mini have 1.2 MP front and 5MP rear cameras. The HDX only has a front-facing camera. If you expect to take pictures with your tablet, the HDX isn't for you.Battery Life: HDX = 11 hours (17 hours when reading); Nexus = 9 hours; iPad Mini = 10 hours. Amazon wins this one, particularly if you will be spending a lot of time reading.Expansion: None of them have a microSD slot; they all assume that you'll be using their respective cloud systems.Parental Controls: All of them have the basic parental controls that allow you to limit your child's access to content, purchases, the web, and so on. Amazon goes farther, though, with the Kindle Free Time and Kindle Free Time Unlimited options, the latter of which is an inexpensive subscription to a curated library of content. If you are buying a first tablet for a child, I'd choose the Kindle Fire HD. At only $139, it is significantly cheaper and it has all of the options that the HDX has.Enterprise: As soon as Amazon releases its update, it will add VPN and network printing support. I believe all of the tablets have basic enterprise capabilities, including that support and various office apps. For real productivity, though, personally I'd go with a laptop, not a tablet.Support: Amazon wins this category, hands down, with the new Mayday system. Apple comes in second, with Apple and Amazon usually taking top marks in any customer support survey. This is an area where Google does not shine.Price: The HDX and Nexus win this one, hands down. Both are priced at $229 vs. $399 for the new iPad Mini. Neither Google nor Amazon makes much, if any, money on their tablets; they're counting on you to purchase content from their respective stores.From my own perspective, there is no single clear winner, as each tablet has strengths and weaknesses. If you already have Amazon Prime, the HDX is a no-brainer, with the access to the Prime Instant Video and the Kindle Owners' Lending Library. If you're primarily buying a tablet to read with, Amazon wins there, as well, with the 17-hour battery life while reading and the best display for reading outdoors. If you want apps, Apple and Google both have far more choices. If you want to watch movies, I'd pick either the HDX or the Nexus, as Apple's aspect ratio and its lagging sound put it at the back of the pack. If price is a factor, then you should pick either the HDX or the Nexus.If you're heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem, i.e., you already own an iPhone or iPad and all of your content is on iTunes, the HDX really isn't the tablet for you. Similarly, if you love browsing Google Play for apps to play on your Samsung Galaxy phone, you're likely to be disappointed in the section available on Amazon (although, as I note above, most of the Google Play apps can be sideloaded onto the tablet). If you love your Google Now or Siri, neither of which will ever be available on Amazon, this isn't the tablet for you.The bottom line: This tablet is primarily intended as a viewport into Amazon content and Amazon services. If you have Amazon Prime and you have Amazon eBooks in your collection, this tablet is a no-brainer. The price is low, particularly for what you get, and it's a small, light, high-quality, high-powered, tablet with a stunning display and superb sound. This really is one of the top tablets in its class.Note: As others have noted, the tablet will update its software when you first turn it on and connect to wifi. Unlike some others, I had no trouble with this operation, no glitches or crashes. It took several minutes but the process ran smoothly, as did the tablet when everything was done.Update:Now that I have a Kindle Fire HD and a Kindle Fire HDX tablet, I'm in a little better position to talk about which one I'd recommend:You should get the Kindle Fire HDX if:- You're a techie who wants the latest and greatest, the best display, the fastest processor.- You need a camera for Skype or other video app.- You play graphics-intensive games (e.g., racing games).- The size and weight matter to you, even in such small increments as this.- You think you will need the Mayday technical support.You should get the Kindle Fire HD if:- Price is a factor. $90 cheaper is not an insignificant amount. This really is an excellent value for the money.- You want an inexpensive tablet for a child (and, for this case, the lack of a camera might well be a plus)- All you want is a basic tablet for reading books, playing music, watching the occasional video, playing Words with Friends, and the like. While the screen on the HD isn't as stunning as is it on the HDX, this is still a true HD screen and it is very good.I check back pretty regularly, so if you have a question, please feel free to ask and I'll do my best to answer it.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice Tablet with Sharp Display", "Author": "Michael Gallagher", "ReviewID": "R23F7ENQQQYOVN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "To sum up what I will tell you about in the details below, for $229 you are getting a good deal on a tablet computer - especially if you compare it to the $199 for last year's first-generation Fire HD and the $500 or more you can spend on a Wi-Fi version of the iPad. Overall, if you consider the price and the functionality I think this is a great tool / toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device: the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and the new HD Fire.  If you are a first-time tablet buyer, where price vs. value is a key consideration, or if you are looking for an affordable tablet for the kids, I'd recommend the \"regular\" Kindle Fire HD that is only $139.  If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of that one.My review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the Fire HDX to the original Fire HD as well as this year's model of the Fire HD, but also some of the features for a first-time user.Consistent with my experience with setup of this year's model of the Kindle Fire HD, setup took a long time: despite being a brand new product, the Fire HDX attempted to download and install several operating software updates.  Software updates on a Kindle are usually in the background, and it was annoying watching the crashes and manual reboots.  Consistent with the Fire HD, it crashed during setup, playing a song, watching a TV show, and reading a book.  It took a little over an hour to get this thing up and running without consistent crashes but after the final software update it has worked as expected without further issues.Screen Display / Video Playback:This version of the Fire has the absolute best screen display of any Fire model to date. Looking at the technical specs Amazon made some major changes in the display / resolution, and the picture appears more crisp: I compared the viewing experience watching with my standard test of the Fire devices over the past couple of years - don't laugh - the first episode of the Wonder Woman TV series from the 70's. The display on this Fire was one heck of a lot better in terms of sharpness than last year's model as well as this year's model of the Fire HD. For you technical folks out there, the display is 1,920 x 1,200 with 50% more pixels per inch than the Fire HD.Wi-Fi Connectivity:The initial Wi-Fi setup took some time as it wouldn't remember the password for my router after each software update / crash / reboot series.  After the final operating software update I mentioned above, however, it was fairly easy to connect to the Internet via Wi-Fi.My standard test for trying out new gadgets is to see how fast they run side-by-side with a known piece of equipment doing the same test at the best place of Wi-Fi in my house and the worst place where it drags. In this comparison, I had this HDX version of the Fire sitting next to last year's and this year's version of the HD Fire, as well as last year's 8.9\" HD Fire, Motorola RAZR smartphone, my iPad 2 (yes, the Kindle guy uses an iPad for work), and the first-generation 7\" Fire (the model from two years ago) all just using a Wi-Fi connection vs. cellular connectivity.My \"normal\" website test is to hit the mobile websites of FoxNews, CNN, my personalized Yahoo page, Google, and the Houston Chronicle. The ones that were usually slow on the other devices were faster on the HDX (Houston Chronicle and CNN), and for the other sites I couldn't tell a difference in speed at the location closest to my router. When I went to the slowest / worst reception location of my house, the speed did have a noticeable difference in the other devices as this one was a little bit faster than all but last year's model of the 7\" Kindle Fire HD; yes, it was also faster than this year's model of the Fire HD but I attribute the increase in speed to the dual antennas on the HDX.Sound / Music Playback:The two speakers are located in the back of the Kindle Fire in two not-noticeable ports: one on the top and one on the bottom. My test of this feature was cranking up Van Halen's Panama to maximum volume (I always want to see if it could really play the guitar licks), and I would alternate covering one speaker up over the other: you have true stereo sound with no degradation of the sound that makes you think you are about to blow the speaker.  The Dolby speakers sound nice and you do get to hear the bass.  However, I am still of the opinion the speakers aren't going to do very well being placed in the back as I am in the front: I want to be able to hear whatever I am listening to without really having to crank it up and disturbing someone else in the room (that's what happens when you start losing your hearing like I am).  While the cover for this version has not shipped yet - why aren't the covers released at the same time? - I imagine the sound quality might decrease with a cover in the back over the speakers.  The X-ray feature is pretty neat as it displays the lyrics on the screen if you are so inclined; if you are not, it is as simple as the tap of an icon to make the lyric feature go away.Email Setup:Consistent with previous versions of the Fire, email setup was very easy for my main Gmail account, both with the software came with the Fire but my primary use of an existing app called Enhanced Email I purchased here in the Amazon app store. I did setup the email app that came with the program with no problem - it took about a minute to setup my main Google account - and I was able to send and receive emails as well as synch my online calendar via Google's calendar and contacts. For those of you asking yourself why am I using the Enhanced Email program, the simple answer is like many of you I have more than one email account: you can quickly switch back and forth on the accounts with the tool. The lazy person in me appreciates that as I don't like getting out of the lazy chair once I'm settled in!New Tabs and Screen Layout:In addition to the normal tabs Amazon has continued to make tweaks with the look and feel to the overall display such as more things to scroll through to find what you are looking for in an easier manner. Interestingly, and consistent with my experiences with this year's model of the Fire HD, I purchased the one with special offers and the only ad I have seen so far is on the main screen saver vs. being overwhelmed with ads like last year's model.Reading Books:Turning pages is pretty darn easy - just tap the side of the screen to go to the next page or back a page, or you can swipe your finger across the screen to do the same.  Amazon did add the feature to see the book's description for books on your device like they have with the e-Ink Kindle (always an annoyance with last year's model), which is a plus as I can't remember what each book in my digital to-be-read pile is about; getting to the book description, requires several taps on the screen to eventually get to where you want to be.  If there is an easier way to do it, I can't find it and maybe I should be one of the first guys, ever, to crack open the electronic user's manual to figure it out (doubt it).  For those of you who have wondered, you still can't organize your books into categories unless you purchase a third-party app</a> here in the Amazon app store.BluetoothThere is a Bluetooth connection, and I did my usual test of this feature by taking it out to my car and having the Fire stream music through my car stereo. There were no delays or skips with the connection, and it paired up in about a minute. Just make sure you give it a device name so you can recognize it and be recognized.Camera:There is a camera on this model - it faces the front or toward the user / reader.  Focusing and taking a picture is pretty easy, and Amazon will by default store your pictures in the Cloud - which counts against your storage allotment.  I'd recommend turning that automatic storage feature off unless you are sure you want it, because if you go over the limit that will provide Amazon another opportunity to collect a monthly revenue stream from you.Charger:Unlike previous models of the Fire, this one DOES include a charger!  If you're scratching your head with that comment, in previous models you had to purchase a charger separately for $20 which always seemed kind of silly for Amazon to do.\"Mayday\" button:A new feature with this model, and not included on this year's \"regular\" model of the Fire, is the introduction of the \"Mayday\" button.  Basically, you can touch the button and a video screen will pop up and you can actually see - and talk to - a live customer service agent.  I haven't pressed the button yet to try it out, as I think I would feel pretty dumb: when they ask me how can they help, I don't want to say \"I just wanted to see if this works and just stopped by to say `hi' for purposes of this review.\"What I Wish it Had: a case that was ready to go and shipped when the Fire was ready (why are we waiting).  A case is very important in order to protect your investment.  Also, I'm interested to see how they try to not hurt the speaker's performance I mentioned above due to the speakers being in the back of the unit and hopefully not covered up with a case.Overall, at $229 for the 16GB of memory model ($309 for 64 GB of memory) I think this is a good deal for someone who really uses the video / apps feature. Kids will love it as they can read books, play games, watch TV and movies, and a whole lot of other things. Adults should like it for the exact same reasons, but while I try to minimize the amount of work-related stuff I do at home with the business apps that are available here in the Amazon App store and other places around the Internet I can also work on Excel and Word-compatible files when I have to without having to fire up my work laptop or whatever the case may be. If you've never owned a tablet before, or are looking to upgrade from an earlier model Fire, I would recommend this one if video and apps are your thing - but make sure you purchase the higher memory one vs. the minimum 16 GB.  If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, or looking for a tablet for your younger children, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of last year's model or get this year's model of the Kindle Fire HD at $139.", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing Performance Worthy of Upgrade", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Goode & Eiffel\"", "ReviewID": "R3IO1X1FKICIE8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Netflix Issue:When I first got the KFHDX, I had no problems with Netflix.

If you already enjoy the Amazon ecosystem, crave responsively fast performance, love gorgeous high resolution screens, wish the Kindle Fire were noticeably lighter, all without sacrificing battery life, while being able to enjoy more benefits of Amazon Prime, plus many other great new features, then stop reading, save time, and hit the \"Add To Cart\" button and buy it.I wanted the Amazon ecosystem. I am a Prime member. I also own a Nexus phone, the Sony Xperia Tablet Z, and a few other Android devices, besides the original Kindle Fire. I don't mind that Kindle Fires don't have Google Play. I have other devices for that. My wife has the iPad 4.If this is going to be your only Android device, then the decision point is which do you prefer, the Google experience or Amazon experience? You can get most of the Amazon experience with a more conventional Android device.  The overlap is not as great going the other way around. However, with the new Fire OS, you do get a few more Amazon exclusive experiences. Weigh your needs and wants to make the best choice.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**SERVICE: Amazon service applies directly to this device since it is their product. Amazon had a one day only FAA 15% off sale for some of the Kindles. I opened up the MayDay and asked the rep if they would honor the discount to those who had previously made the purchase. I was told it would only apply for those who had made the purchase within the last 7 days. That was not me. The MayDay rep didn't really do anything wrong, but she just appeared as if she didn't care and seemed a little annoyed at my request. Because the customer CAN see the MayDay rep, in my mind, it would be very important that person have a smile and warm demeanor. I've done tech support for a business I once owned, and a simple thing like this can make a huge difference in how a customer perceives a company.I had also emailed Amazon, received a reply with a number, and gave that a call. The initial rep was kind enough to refer me to someone who could make that decision. The manager I spoke with made the decision to honor a partial refund, even though the 64GB model I had purchased was not one of the sale items. I didn't get the full 15%, but it was about 12% discount. I thought this was more than fair and I appreciated the fact that Amazon allows their service managers the freedom to make these kind of decision.I believe there were two factors in play. 1. My standing with Amazon as a shopper (not that they don't care about all their customers, but it's nice to be appreciated for being a loyal customer!) 2. I was still within my return window. I could have sent it back, bought the sale version and still come out ahead, in theory. It would have been a headache and extra cost for all involved, and this service manager was keen enough to save us all that headache. Even if I had to go that way, it's still great service that I could return the device this long after the purchase, for any reason.If I could make one request, it would be that there was a dedicated link within Amazon Shop for writing reviews. I find typing to be one of the more accurate experiences on the Fire HDX, much improved over original Fire, and would like to be able to write reviews straight from the new Fire HDX.After about 1.5 months use, I have no buyer's remorse. This is a great tablet and a great buy for Amazon fans.====================FIRST IMPRESSIONS====================The packaging, for those of you who care, was like looking at movie poster. It got you interested, excited and ready to open it up. Once the cover was opened, box unsealed, and then opened, the inside was simple and elegant. Inside is the Kindle Fire HDX, the 5 watt charger (not 9 watt), and a nice thick 5 foot long USB to micro-USB cord. That's it.Compared to the original Kindle Fire, the HDX 7\" is noticeably lighter and easier to hold. The angled edge harmoniously eases the hand into a comfortable holding position. This is great to hold! When holding landscape mode, the top, where the speakers are, is smooth glossy plastic. It attracts fingerprints but it actually adds to the grip. The Amazon logo that is recessed in the back is also this same gloss and also helps make the device less slippery to hold. Well done. Fortunately, those are the only places that are glossy plastic.Turning on the device, Amazon already had associated the device with my account. The carousel was familiar. But swipe up and there was the typical icon view.Overall, the device is snappy and responsive. No more lag. I love it! The screen is gorgeous. It rotates quickly from landscape to portrait. It's the best rotating screen I've experienced on any Android device so far, and I've had my share of Android devices.There are a myriad of new features to learn from the upgrade. So far, I like them - a lot. The Mojito OS does take some exploring to get fully adjusted. I'm still in that process after two hours of playing around.====================THE DETAILS====================-------------------------APPS (Added 2 DEC 2013):-------------------------One of the biggest CONS people mention about the Kindle Fire line is the lack of Google Play, which primarily means limited app choices. This is true. There are apps I wish I could get on the Kindle Fire HDX. For some this may be a deal killer. For me, it is not.Amazon has really gone above and beyond to make the lack of Google Play so much easier to take. Since I purchased the Kindle Fire HDX, it came with 500 Amazon coins. Within the Amazon Apps world, this translates to $5.00 to spend on any app. In the month plus I've been an owner, Amazon has offered a ton of free apps, good ones! In some cases, they offered a free app, plus more free coins. There seems to be no shortage of ways to get free coins. Even when I do spend the coins (and not my real money yet,) I've made a handful of purchases where I got more coins back, in one case, 250 coins just for making my first purchase using coins. Some of these deals equate to discounts of 30% or more.My new Kindle Fire HDX is loaded with games and apps I'd likely not have purchased on my own. Between this give-a-way fest and their daily free apps, I have a lot of great choices for full paid apps. Not all the daily free apps are very good, but some are. It's worth checking out, especially during this Thanksgiving/Christmas time period.The Kindle Fire is meant for consumption and Amazon has done a great job making sure I can do just that without breaking the bank. Amazon makes up for its shortcoming in the apps department by being far more generous than Google is with their store.With the current Cyber Monday sale, the Kindle Fire HDX is a steal! Let me reinforce that the Snapdragon 800 processor/Adreno 330 combo is one awesome setup! It makes apps like Minecraft, RipTide 2 and others look gorgeous and perform without hiccup. It's no small deal that the top of the line hardware can be had for bargain hunter prices.----------TURN IT ON:----------The power button is on the left back side. It does take a moment to figure this out when being used to a button on the top or side has been the norm for so long. It's not a big deal, but surprising after forgetting for the first time.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**I still find the button on back to be somewhat clumsy. Even though the other side has two recessed buttons for the volume, it doesn't stand out enough for me. I'm still flipping the device back and forth at night with little or no light. Even in the day time or with light, I have to make a concerted effort to determine which way is up and remember that the power button is on the left. With my other devices, I just feel for the button and push.-----------------------------DOWNLOAD PRIME VIDEOS:-----------------------------This is the main reason I purchased the 64 GB WiFi version. First, I could take videos with me when I had no internet connection, such as in a car. Second, when my kids want to watch videos, I can download their favorites so they won't be hogging the bandwidth at home!How does this work? Go to the videos, choose the desired video and an option to download will be there. My first attempt to download a Prime video, I chose Downtown Abbey Season 3, Episode 1, which was 1:06 hours long. I was given three options: Standard Definition, 720P HD and 1080 HD. I selected the 1080P HD option first.My internet is 10 Mb/s DSL download speeds. I made it to about 44% downloaded after about 50 minutes. Of course, I kept on checking out other features during the wait. While trying to start Flick Soccer, the device locked up on me. I was stuck. I held the power button for a good while and it rebooted.The HDX then successfully upgraded the system, something that failed after my initial setup. Yes, an update already (for the Mayday button!) When I looked to see if the video was there, it was not. I had to start all over again. It didn't save.This time, I chose 720P HD. It took about 19 minutes to download. I was previously able to view the 1080P video while it was downloading. It looked awesome. The 720P HD looked just about as good. Some action scenes, I could tell it was lower quality, but not that noticeable. This 1:06 hour 720P HD video file consumed 1.24 GBs of space.Next I tried the SD, or lowest quality option and downloaded Episode 2. This took 5 minutes and 44 seconds. The SD video file size for a 1:06 episode was 267MB. The video was a tad blurry, more choppy during action, and more noise, grain and artifacts. However, for standard definition, it was surprisingly passable. Download your young kid's videos in SD and save some space. They won't care, and even you may not.Finally, I retried the 1080P video with Episode 3. This time, it took 44 minutes 38 seconds to successfully download. The quality, as mentioned before, was excellent. The colors were vibrant, the video sharp and fluid. It took up 2.07GBs of space.Here is the rundown. About 1 hour video episode of Downtown Abbey. 10 Mb/s DSL download speed.SD = 5:44 minutes to download. 267MB. Quite decent quality.720P = 19:12 minutes to download. 1.24GB. Very good quality.1080P = 44:38 minutes to download. 2.07 GB. Excellent quality.For those who are new to the Amazon world, yes, you can download the Netflix app and watch those, too, minus the download for later option.**UPDATE 23 OCT 2013**:Yes, there are 3 quality settings for downloading Prime Videos. After digging around, I found a few more choices.After swiping down system menu in the Home screen, go to:Settings / Applications / VideosHere you will see individual settings for HD and SD downloads. It turns out HD has 3 quality settings and SD has 3 quality settings.  I chose to ask for each setting.Also, in this menu, you will find the option for Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 Audio. Because this increases the size of the video while streaming, it is turned OFF by default. I turned it on and it does make a noticeable difference with surround sound effect, both with speakers and headphones. The video you are watching will need to support this feature.In this Video settings, there is also the option to clear video search history.Another discovery with Prime Video downloads is that most videos do have a time limit for viewing offline. As long as you connect back online, it resets that time, so not a big deal in most cases. So far, I've noticed videos such as \"Under the Dome\" have a 48 hour limit offline before needing to reconnect. Other videos have a 30 day window. It seems as if some of the kids' videos had no such time limit for offline viewing.**UPDATE 2 DEC 2013**I am discovering that not all Prime videos can be downloaded. This seems to be true with a lot of newer Prime movies and some TV shows. I'm hoping it is a licensing issue and not a decision made by Amazon. If possible, please make ALL Prime videos downloadable!I also find the ability to browse videos to be tedious. Similar to Netflix, on the Kindle devices, Amazon pushes out choices to you in limited quantities. If your watching habits change on any given day, you will need to really dig into the menu choices to see all the viewing options out there. The menu choices overlap and can make browsing confusing, and a challenge to track what one has already browsed.In the Videos, in the side menu under \"Prime Instant Video\" there are three main choices:Top TV ShowsTop MoviesFor the KidsWhat tipped me off, is under \"For the Kids\" there are very few choices. I knew from my Roku device and from browsing from a web viewer, there had to be more choices for the kids.Regardless of which of the three main categories one chooses, each has a sub-menu found by tapping the little down arrow that is right of the category description, such as:MOVIES (Upper left hand corner once this choice has been selected)Top Movies, Prime (Right under, MOVIE, in smaller letters) and the arrow is just right of this.Each main category has sub-menu items, as noted before. But each sub-menu also has the same choices. These would be the same regardless of which main category one came from. Hence, this is where some confusion can come into play.What each sub-menu has, within each main Prime category, is an option called, \"Genres.\"  This is where one needs to go to find the rest of the Prime viewing choices. Unfortunately, there are even more sub-categories within each Genre choice. One will never find all the choices in one place for mass browsing.Are you confused? That is my point. Browsing could be less confusing and easier to navigate.For these two points within Prime Video, I'd knock off a half star. But since I can't, I'll leave my rating at 5 stars because overall, I'm still very happy with the device.----------AUDIO:----------I found the speakers to have decent sound. It sounds a tad more fuller than my Sony Xperia Tablet Z, but iPad 4 is still much better and sounds louder. The new HDX is sufficiently loud enough while holding it, but I do wish it could go a notch or two louder. With my Klipsch X10i head phones, the sound was plenty loud. It sounded better than the speakers and was OK. It won't win over Audiophiles, but good enough for entertainment purposes.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**In Settings/Device/Applications/Videos Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 Audio is shut off by default. Turn it on. It improves the sound, especially with the built in speakers. I can actually sense a better surround sound effect in videos that support this.I find that the speaker sound is actually pretty good the more I use it. There is more meat to the sound than I initially thought. For personal use, the loudness is good in a quiet environment. The sound quality is good for a tablet. The sound stage is narrow. The surround sound effect, once turned on is decent. The simulated surround effect is noticed most of the time.I still think the iPad 4 has the best built in speakers I've heard on a phone or tablet. I listened to the built in speakers on the new iPad Air, and the Kindle Fire HDX is much better. The iPad Air built in speakers takes a big step back compared to the iPad 4. The Air also has mono speakers and it really sounds mono, in a bad way.**UPDATE 2 DEC 2013**Rather than relying strictly on my memory, I went back and tested the audio side by side with my wife's iPad 4. I would say the sound quality is about the same. What I overlooked was the fact the iPad 4 only has one external speaker. It is mono. In that regards, I give the nod to the Kindle Fire HDX. With some surround effect, once turned on, the HDX separates itself even more. From my own testing, the built in speakers are one of the best on any tablet or phone. The more I use it this way, the more I am enjoying it. In most cases where disturbing others is not a concern, I don't feel compelled to need headphones. If one does need a little bit louder sound, hold it with both hands from the top, and the sound reflects directly to you, making it sound a little louder. The decision to put the speakers on top in landscape mode, was a very good one.----------GRAPHICS:----------The HDX has the latest and greatest Adreno graphics to compliment the current king of the hill quad-core Snapdragon 800 2.2GHz processor. Yes, it is a huge upgrade from the original Kindle. Huge!Playing the Temple Run games, I'd get frustrated with the lag on the original Kindle Fire. No more lag. Graphics look great. No video tearing.In Minecraft PE, the original Kindle can play it, but It's not a great experience. The HDX plays it with the best Androids out there. Once again, the beautiful screen and powerful graphics chip makes playing Minecraft a joy, even with Amazon's highly skinned version of Android running it.----------SCREEN:----------The screen is sharp. Texts are very crisp. Colors are accurate and beautiful. There are no pixels to be seen by my naked eye.One nice surprise is that the screen itself seems to be somewhat oliophobic. While fingerprints are there, they seem to disappear some. It is one of the better screens for this, at least that is my initial impression. I don't think this was even intended. I'll revisit this later with more time.The screen is glossy. It does reflect a lot. But once turned on, it can be noticeable, but also easily forgotten. If you are prone to glare and easily distracted by it, keep this in mind.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**After further use, I still think the Kindle Fire HDX screen is one of the best screens in terms of keeping it clean. It does collect finger oils, but I find it still keeps on cleaning off easier than any other device I've ever used. I don't even need a special cloth. Just by cleaning it off with the palm of my hands, the screen looks nearly clean again!----------MAYDAY:----------Yes, I tried it. I really had a question! No, really! I knew that while reading a book, the HDX could have its contrast adjusted for better reading in sunlight, as well as longer battery life. I looked everywhere how to get to this setting. I couldn't find it.I opened up the Mayday feature and waited about 30 seconds to connect. After confirming my email, address and name associated with my account, I was asked how they could help. With the speaker on full volume, I had a difficult time hearing the female tech, Celeste. I asked her my question and she did need to seek help to find the answer, but I got the answer. She was friendly. I could move the little window wherever I wanted. At one point, she took control of the screen.The answer was that the screen brightness setting had to be set to auto and it would then recognize when to make the adjustments while reading.It might seem a little daunting to do tech support via video conference. Don't worry. The video is one way. They don't ever see you. The tech can only see your screen.The Mayday button is added with the first initial system update, which should take place during the setup. But if it failed the first time like it did for me, you won't see it when swiping down for the settings on top of the screen. Manually update the Kindle by swiping down the top and finding it in the settings.I really don't see Mayday being a feature I'll need much, but it's a nice touch for the tech challenged.----------X-RAY:----------This could be one of the most underrated features. I didn't bat an eye about it before the purchase. Now, I think it is really useful and can see myself turning to it all the time.In movies, tap the video screen and X-Ray pops up on the left side. X-Ray detects which characters are in the current scene and you can find out more about the actor. Trivia facts are also there. It's like watching a DVD with narration on, only much less annoying and much smarter.In the Music player, X-Ray provides scrolling lyrics that follow the song as it goes. If you are a karaoke fan (I am not much so) then you will love this.Yes, even in some books, X-Ray is there. It provides footnote like data about characters and terms. I've only seen it in the book Les Miserable. There could be more. I'm guessing it depends on what the publisher provides.----------------SILK WEB BROWSER:----------------It's pretty fast for an Android tablet. On a tablet, I still find the Ipad 4 is the best experience with Safari. There is the option for mobile website, desktop version, or automatic. This is a bit misleading. I prefer desktop version of websites. However, with Silk, you won't get a real desktop experience. Silk still customizes the website to fit the HDX screen. The accuracy will depend on each website.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013***I find I don't use the Silk Browser much unless I need to quick look something up. I really wish the option to have a full desktop view did just that. On some of my sites, like Yahoo, it does a bad job of rendering pages. I may have to side load Chrome.---------------KINDLE FREETIME:---------------I just set up Kindle FreeTime. I did the Family Plan for up to 6 kid profiles for $6.99 a month. The other option is for one child for $2.99 a month.Once I set the age (but not actual birthdays, just close to their age) for each child, and subscribed to the unlimited family plan, I tried using it.It was a bit confusing at first. I wanted to set the content for each child. I couldn't find all these \"unlimited\" apps, books and videos for kids. I could only see what was already on my device or what I owned in the cloud.Only when I actually logged in as one of my kids, did I see all the kid's content I had subscribed. There were plenty of choices. The initial choices were for me to determine what I wanted my kids to be able to access that was for my main account. No, I don't want them to have access to all me and my wife's content. But yes, I do want them to have access to other apps and videos we already purchased. That was what the initial content filtering was all about.My first impression of Kindle FreeTime is that I may end up having to buy each kid their own Kindle. I can see them fighting over MY, I stress MY, Kindle HDX. I may never see it again once I let them on it. I think it's going to be that good. Thankfully, I can set time limits for them!**UPDATE 23 OCT 2013**:I could not download videos for offline use within FreeTime. That seems to be an Amazon Prime video benefit.Only certain books could be downloaded and viewed while offline.I did like that some books can be set to have a narrator read the books to the young child. This is good for my 3 year old. He loves the Thomas books that do this.------------BATTERY LIFE:------------The HDX came with about 60% charge. I'm making an educated guess since it was a graphic meter that is the default battery indicator. I changed it to show percentage after I'd used the Kindle for a short while. It had 54% by that time. After about 4.5 -5 hours of very heavy usage setting up, testing and downloading, I'm at the last 1%.After completely draining the battery to where it shut off by itself, here is what I've been able to measure for recharging with the standard 5 watt included charger, which does eat up 2 outlets on an older power strip:15% in 28:44 minutes30% in 1:00 hour40% in 1:22 hours50% in 1:42 hours60% in 2:03 hours70% in 2:21 hours90% in 3:05 hours95% in 3:15 hours100% in 3:34 hours Whew!Note: There is no indicator light to show charging status.**UPDATE 25 OCT 2013**:I let my kids use the new Kindle Fire HDX during a 4 hour trip to visit family. With some video, lots of multiplayer MineCraft use, it lasted from Noon to 9 PM with about 35% battery life left. It wasn't on all the time, but it was being used frequently.In a more detailed drain test, here are the results:5:41 Hours = 100% Brightness playing constant video (downloaded)9:28 Hours = 50% Brightness playing constant video (downloaded)During the 50% brightness test, it took 4:52 hours to drain down to 50% battery life. It took 4:36 minutes to drain from 50% down to 0% where it powered off on its own.50% brightness is still viewable even in a well lit room. However, I'd at least go 70%. In dimly lit areas with some light, 50% is plenty bright.The Kindle HDX is very efficient with power. It barely warms up and it never gets hot. The claimed rating of 11 hours with mixed use seems about right and that's using it constantly. With light to medium use, one could easily go a full day and likely two or three away from a power source.----------------------------HOW MUCH MEMORY SHOULD I GET:----------------------------The base model with 16GB memory is $229. To double that memory to 32GB costs another $40. Compared to Apple's memory upgrade practice, this is a cheap upgrade. To quadruple the base memory of 16GB to 64GB costs $80. This is the best value if you are going to upgrade the internal storage size. Here's why:$2.50 per GB to add 16GB storage to base model for a total of 32GB.$1.67 per GB to add 48GB storage to the base model for a total of 64GB.I got the 64GB model because I am a content lover. I love choice. I love freedom to use even when speedy internet is not available. I want to be able to download videos for my kids when travelling in the car. Even at home, I'd rather they view videos locally from a device so I don't have to fight bandwidth with them! Data these days can add up fast. 8 GB on original Kindle Fire was definitely not enough for me. The new HDX can't be upgraded later, so I did it now. 64 GB was the cheapest upgrade option per GB. Your reasons may vary, but maybe that will help you decide what's best for you just in case you haven't thought about a few of those points.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**If you want to save some money, the 32GB should be enough for most people. I consider myself a heavier user. I currently have about 17 episodes (most an hour episode) and 2 full length movies, all in 720P HD and I have 31.5GB space left. I haven't loaded my own videos yet, but that is something I plan on doing. I'm glad I got 64GB.For those of you that don't care about storing large files on the Kindle device, the 16GB should suffice. If you change your mind down the road, you'll need to buy a whole new device, so be sure of what you want. I will say that I'm glad 8GB option is gone. That just didn't cut it.If you are buying for kids, 16GB could be enough. Download videos in SD and it will save a lot of space and still be decent viewing quality. Also, with some diligence, simply delete content you've watched and you'll get that space back. If you can live without the convenience and willing to work at it a bit, 16GB is still a good choice. For kid use with SD video, the 32GB option will give you ample room for the convenience factor.-----------------------------------SPECIAL OFFERS OR NO SPECIAL OFFERS:-----------------------------------I opted to keep the special offers. Why? Because, they don't bother anyone. You'll only see them from time to time on the screen lock when you first turn the HDX on. Special Offers don't show up at any other time when you are using the device. If you like Gold Box deals, supposedly, some of these offers can be exclusive and even better deals. Why not? I'll save $15 for that. I think people make way too big a fuss over this. Spend that money on some apps, songs or other content. The fun you'll get from that will far outweigh the seeing a few ads that barely intrude on your life.----------PORTS:----------I have noticed that plugging in both the head phone jack and the micro-USB port requires going in at a slight angle. The angle matches the angled edges of the Kindle HDX. Don't force it in straight on! Be gentle at first until you get the feel of it.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013***After almost a month and a half, I find the micro-USB power port to remain a tight and secure fit. It's one of the most secure feeling connections I've felt for a micro-USB device. We'll see how it holds up after more time.----------------------KINDLE ONLY EXCLUSIVES:----------------------Try watching Amazon Prime videos from an Android device post ICS. Google doesn't support Adobe Flash in Android any more. I find it frustrating. I can watch Amazon Prime videos from my Kindle devices.I am one that does like to listen to my books while driving. You can't do this from the Kindle app on other Android devices. Text to speech only works on actual Kindle devices. I'm not sure if the text to speech voice changed with the Mojito OS, but I like the new voice better. It is still mechanical, but much better. My only gripe is that the text to speech shuts off if you manually turn a page and when screen rotates. Please change this! Let text to speech stop when I choose to stop it, especially when driving in a car.====================PARTING THOUGHTS====================The Kindle 7\" HDX is meant for consumption of content for Amazon lovers. It excels at this in almost every way, from hardware to software. If you love Amazon, absolutely get it. Navigating Amazon's skinned Android is simple and easy to use, but not meant for the tinkerer. It's definitely not Apple in design. But, it is functional. It knows what it is and the latest Kindle Fire HDX, to me, is even more exciting than the original. The improvements are that good.====================PROS & CONS====================PROS:o Top of the line hardware, super fast and responsiveo Gorgeous screen for both resolution and coloro Screen handles fingerprints very wello Lightweight and easy to holdo Download Prime Videoso Long battery lifeo Crisp text for readingo Great price for the hardwareo Kindle FreeTime for the kidso Parental controlso X-Ray provides useful information for video, music and bookso Kindle exclusive featureso Mayday offers free support and helpCONS:o Back power and volume buttons need getting used too Speakers sound OK, but could be a little loudero Text to speech in books stops with screen rotation or manual turn of pageo No rear camerao No HDMI out porto No GPSo No Google Play", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Blue/purple border on white pages!", "Author": "LindaFus \"lindafus\"", "ReviewID": "RXJ3VD36FN0O2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased my Kindle Fire HDX from Best Buy. After trying to read a book, I noticed a pretty bright blue/purple streak that never went away on the sides of the pages. Going into Sepia and changing the background pages did not help this issue.  I called Amazon and they replaced it with a new one. The new one has the same blue/purple border on white and light background pages. The Amazon replacement is more subtle and even around the edges, so I opted to return the one that had the darker boarder.I now see on Amazon's  description of the Kindle Fire HDX that they actually mention this defect as being normal and I quote below:----------------We want you to know...\"The Kindle Fire HDX 7\" has perfect color accuracy (100% sRGB), and we wanted to share more details around our display design decisions that helped us achieve this.You may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. All displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy. Most LCD displays use white LEDs, and then apply filters to extract the desired color. The result is oftentimes a compromise to tone and color accuracy, or--if attempting to address these compromises--an increase in battery consumption and, thus, device weight.We've taken a different approach. To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7\" at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20% improvement in power efficiency.\"---------------This glow is not light nor is it narrow.  The text of a book runs through this and it is very uncomfortable to read this way. This is also true for the Silk Web browser.  I will keep my Kindle Fire for a bit and see how this all pans out with Amazon.  Buyer beware:  Reading with this blue/purple glow is not the same as it is on your Kindle HD or older.After stating the above, I will say, other than this serious screen flaw, this device runs everything else flawlessly and I love streaming movies on this device. Netflix runs great as does Amazon Prime movies. Apps load instantly and web pages as well. This screen issue not so much. I am a bit confused as to why Amazon thinks this blue/purple haze is ok.  I will try to get used to it.", "Date": "October 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Most amazing device I've ever owned!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1NFRVWEUS01UH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm 64 years of age and a teacher. I am no techie, but really enjoy the electronic gadgets that are being invented these days. I preordered and purchased the very first generation Kindle 2 years ago and felt that it was time for an upgrade. This time, I waited a couple of days to see how it was received by the public and to catch a few of the early reviews before deciding to order. I'm sorry I waited. This tablet is AMAZING for my purposes! It is designed for media consumption and anyone who purchase it ought to be aware of it. It does a great job in that aspect.The \"purple haze\" a number of reviewers have complained about seems quite inobtrusive to me. I don't know that if I were not previously aware it would even be in the discussion. It is a very faint, but discernible border around thedevice when reading.  I haven't found it to be annoying at all and shouldn't be a deal-breaker.I use the device for reading of books and magazines, watching movies and television shows, playing games, e-mail and light surfing of the web. I'm even able to download my students' grades and attendance records from the school web site more rapidly than my hardwired computer in my workplace! The screen picture is more than outstanding...it is unbelievable! The keyboard appears when it is supposed to and is very responsive, just like the rest of the touch screen. And lest I forget the Mayday button, this whole concept is unreal, when I consider the time spent with most customer service outfits on the phone line waiting for my cal to be answered. Great job, AmazonDownloads of movies and games are quick. I have installed Netflix and Hulu Plus on the device and they work flawlessly with the device. As a Prime member as well, it works seamlessly. My digital subscriptions to several magazines were a snap to transfer to this device. All in all, my expectations were far exceeded by the product.The device is lightweight, beautiful and so cool I purchased an inexpensive ($4.95) case on line from Poetic that provides a lightweight shell and keeps the sleekness of the device intact, yet still allows me to prop it up for video viewing. It also puts the device in sleep mode when the cover is closed and the device immediately awakes when the cover is opened.While I understand the criticism, why buy the device if you knew it's limitations? It is the best at what it is supposed to do and the price when compared to other tablets on the market is a steal, if you consider what it is able to do (and not what it WASN'T supposed to do.In summation, if you are not a techie and just like to relax with a movie, read a book or magazine or play a game, start ordering your HDX now. Media doesn't have to cost you a fortune, is thousand of books I have ordered over the years have been free, and for a couple of hundred dollars a year I and my wife get all the video we want for all our devices from Prime, Netflix and Hulu +. It's the best toy I ever bought. Final rating: 9 out 0f 5!!!!!", "Date": "November 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best 7\" tablet on the market?", "Author": "J. Chambers", "ReviewID": "R3N1QB8TWW0WRJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "NOTE: This review is for the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" tablet with 32GB, special offers, and Wi-Fi only.I pre-ordered both the original Kindle Fire and the Kindle Fire HD 7\" tablets when they were first announced. It was love at first swipe. The second generation HD was a huge advance over the first generation, with the welcomed addition of an external volume control, an HDMI port, and higher screen resolution. The HDX is also a big step-up from its predecessor. The most obvious improvements:* Higher resolution - 1920x1200 (323 ppi) in the HDX versus 1280x800 (216 ppi) in the HD. That's a huge difference, especially when viewing HD videos. The HDX has a new graphics processor that Amazon says has 4X the performance of the HD.* Faster processor - a 2.2GHz quad-core Snapdragon processor in the HDX versus 1.5GHz dual-core processor in the HD. This is really advanced hardware for a tablet, putting the HDX at the high-performance end of the tablet market. Also, the HDX has 2GB of RAM, compared to the HD's 1GB.* Longer battery life - 11 hours (up to 17 hours in a \"reading mode\") for the HDX versus 10 hours for the HD.* Lighter weight - 10.7 ounces for the HDX versus 13.9 ounces for the HD. That's a noticeable difference when you're hand-holding the Fire. The weight reduction comes from a magnesium body covered with a rubbery material that's easy to grip. The shape is different, too, with beveled edges that help with hand-holding the HDX, since your fingers curl around it better. Also, the speakers have been moved from their position in the HD to the top of the beveled section (in the landscape orientation). This is a nice improvement from the HD, since your fingers won't cover the speakers in the HDX. And speaking of audio, X-Ray lyrics for my downloaded songs is a really cool feature. Really cool.* I like the new display. The display on the HD was the carousel filling most of the home page. This is still the default on the HDX, but swiping upward fills the screen with apps instead.* The power button and volume control have been moved. I hated the ones on the HD. They were hard to see and hard to find by feel. On the HDX, the concave buttons are on either side of the tablet when it's held in landscape position. It's not perfect, but I like it better.Those improvements alone make the HDX worth upgrading from the HD in my opinion. My biggest frustration with the HD was how the Silk browser was unresponsive sometimes, sitting there while I tapped a link several times. Occasionally, rebooting got the browser back on track, but it was frustrating. I've been using the HDX's browser for several hours, and it's been very smooth and responsive so far.I've already noticed a lot of fairly minor changes from the HD. For one, they've tweaked the virtual keyboard a bit. The most obvious change was to kill the long-press apostrophe from the period key. Now the apostrophe is on the numerical keyboard. It's not a big deal, it just takes some getting used to. Also, from some of the first reviews of the HDX that I read, some users are complaining about a purple border around web pages. To be honest, I barely noticed it. It's a very light purple about a tenth of an inch wide on my HDX. I don't know why it's there, but it doesn't bother me.Amazon will now allow some Prime Instant Video movies and TV shows to be downloaded onto the HDX and viewed later. I haven't tried this yet (and I don't know how you identify these videos if this feature is active), but it may be a good enough reason to go with the 32GB or 64GB versions of the HDX if you watch a lot of videos and aren't always connected to Wi-Fi. By the way, the HDX's memory is in a single partition where you can store anything, including books/audio books/magazines, apps, music, and videos. With my 32GB version of the HDX, about 25GB was free when I got the device.The most innovative new feature in the HDX is the \"Mayday\" button. Amazon says this will connect you with a real person who can in real-time walk you through a problem. (You must have an active internet connection to do this.) I just had to try it, so I did. \"Katie\" came online in just a few seconds, and after verifying my name, home address, and email address, she helped me with a couple of questions I had. That's remarkable customer service.As good as it is, though, the HDX isn't perfect. Here are my biggest disappointments:* They took the HDMI port away. Granted, with Prime streaming videos and our Roku box, I didn't use it often, but I wish it was still there. Amazon has announced that there's a software update coming that will let you send video through a PlayStation 3 or to certain Samsung TVs, but I don't have either of those.* There's still no GPS in the Wi-Fi HDX, although unless you have the 4G model (which includes GPS), it doesn't matter so much. In any case, you can still use apps like MapQuest for trip planning.* No speech recognition. I really hate this. Without this feature, there won't be any cool apps like Apple's Siri or Android's Speaktoit Assistant. Actually, you can install Speaktoit Assistant from the Amazon appstore, but you have to type in commands instead of speaking them. (Note: I read somewhere that it's possible to download Google Voice Search from the Google Play store, enabling speech recognition on the Kindle Fire.) There is a microphone, though, so you can use voice recorder apps and music recognition apps like Shazam and SoundHound.But despite a few disappointments, I'm generally very pleased with the HDX. It's a superb tablet. Although the Amazon appstore is still dwarfed by Google Play, Amazon's vast media library of books and magazines, videos, and music more than makes up for fewer apps, at least for me. The very smooth Silk web browser is greatly improved, and setting up email accounts and using email is very easy.I haven't bought a cover for the HDX, although I'm sure I will, since my old HD case won't fit the HDX. Amazon has its \"Origami\" case, and other companies are already advertising their HDX cases, but I'll wait a month or two and see what all is out there before buying one. Fortunately, the HDX's size is close enough to the HD's that the padded sleeve I got for the HD is big enough for the HDX.And a pleasant surprise: Kindles always ship with a USB charging cable, but I was surprised to see a wall charger in the box too.Bottom line: I really like the HDX, and for me it was worth the upgrade from my year-old HD.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not Worth the Aggravation of the Connection Problems", "Author": "Wayne \"wyadams\"", "ReviewID": "R31UC33XHKN8MS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It seems that Amazon is aware that the Kindle Fire has problems connecting and staying connected to wireless networks, and has chosen to ignore the problem and continue to sell this piece of garbage.

It disconnects from our network at random times, and at other times will not connect at all, sometimes for an entire day. At the same time this is happening, I am sitting next to her using my Motorola Xoom which has a good strong (four bars), stable connection, so it is not a network problem, it is a device problem. In fact no other wireless device on our network has EVER had connection problems.My recommendation is to find some other HD tablet and wait for Amazon to get the message that they can't foist this kind of garbage on the public and expect us to buy it.In addition, though the display and sound are excellent, there is not enough difference between the Fire and other HD tablets to make it worth the aggravation and hours of dead time.

This will be the third kindle in my household. I currently own a basic e-reader kindle and my fiance has the second generation kindle fire. Let me just say, this one blows all the rest completely out of the water. The display is sharp, the speakers are simply amazing, and the performance is outstanding for the price.Display:The display is crystal clear and is full HD. Just think about that for a second; it has the same resolution as any full size HDTV! On a 7in screen, it really shines. If you hold this side by side to an ipad mini, the display on the fire HDX wins hands down not only in resolution and color, but also clarity.Speakers:This is what impressed me the most about this tablet..... The speakers: Full Dolby HD that have great bass and a nice clear sound. These speakers are better than most laptop speakers. They go loud enough to fill a room and do not lose any of the sound quality.Performance:Performance (at least in my experience) is on par with the current generation ipads. My parents have an iPad and the fire HDX is just as responsive and snappy. No doubt this is due to the new chipset inside. Gone are the days of stutter, missed taps, and lagging swipes. The HDX even does multi-tasking (something that was missing of fire's and fire HD's of past).Battery:I've gotten all day use out of it. Based on my estimates, I will meet the time Amazon advertises, based on my daily usage of games, web browsing, and music. The fire HDX comes with a power cord!!! (Finally!!!). However, this power cord is just adequate. It's only a 5W charger instead of the 9W. As long as you don't need to use the HDX and charge it at the same time, the supplied charger is good. It takes almost all night to fully charge w/ the 5W included adapter. If you're a heavy tablet user, I'd buy the 9W charger.Mayday:This is the best feature of this tablet. It works just as you see on tv! I had an issue setting up part of my HDX. I hit the mayday button, and 10 seconds later I was chatting with a live person! I was shocked that it was exactly as you see on TV! This is perfect for anyone who is new to kindle, or to the world of tablets. I can see this being a definite benefit.Overall:The fire HDX is the best kindle to date. The performance is second to none, the display is great, the speakers are some of the best I've ever heard on a tablet, and the mayday feature is icing on the cake! I think the price is right on the mark for what you get. It's a great value tablet and a great performing tablet all in one.One note of caution:The charging port is on an angle and if you're not careful, I could see this being an issue down the line. If you try to lay the HDX screen side down, you will bend and put stress on the charging cable.", "Date": "October 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Big bang for your buck", "Author": "Kendall Giles",

what's in the box:* Kindle Fire HDX 7\u2033 tablet computer* Micro USB charging cable* AC adapter* Quick-start guideMy Kindle powered up right away out of the box, and after entering password information for my firewall and a few other simple admin steps, I was online and ready to go.In fact, the Kindle Fire HDX immediately populated the Books, Videos, and Music tabs with items I had previously purchased on Amazon. All I had to do was tap the icon for the James Bond: The Authorised Biography, by John Pearson, or the album cover for the new Black Sabbath album 13 and, after a brief download, I was reading and rocking, respectively.Aside from the ease of getting online and using the device without a lot of hassle, I enjoyed several welcome features:* The Kindle felt good in the hand: the dimensions of the unit are 7.3\u2033 x 5.0\u2033 x .35\u2033, and at 303 grams in weight (lighter than the Apple iPad Mini 2), it was easy for me to hold with one hand.*  The display was absolutely brilliant: at 1920\u00d71200 pixels, the 7\u2033 screen clocks in at 323 Pixels Per Inch (PPI), which is up there with the best of the tablets. The text was crisp, the images gorgeous, and the videos seamless. As a writer and Computer Scientist, I'm accutely aware of technology getting in the way of what John Gardner calls the \"vivid and continuous dream\" enjoyed when immersed in a compelling story. This display, along with the quad-core CPU and user inteface supplied by the Kindle Fire OS 3.0 \"Mojito\", does not get in the way of what you are reading or seeing.* After a couple days use, I'm still using the device as I got it right from the box. The rated battery life is 11 hours of mixed use, and 17 hours when reading.* The dual Dolby audio stereo speakers crank out adequate volume, though the 3.5mm stereo headphone jack helps me really tune out the world when I'm listening to an audio book or movie or Black Sabbath.* The front-facing camera and built-in microphone are useful especially for Skype calls.* The unit's Bluetooth support and video streaming capabilities are helping me get in shape, since I can watch movies and crank the volume with an external Bluetooth speaker when running on a treadmill.* The unit came with lots of built-in apps that allowed me to be productive and entertained right out of the box, with more available on Amazon.Note that I haven't yet used the Mayday button, which is supposed to connect you, if you need help, to an Amazon expert 24\u00d77, but it's a nice feature to have in my back pocket.Also, I was already a Prime member, which gives me free 2-day shipping when shopping on Amazon, the ability to stream or download Prime Instant videos, and a free ebook a month, so the 30 days of free Prime membership with the purchase of the Kindle Fire HDX was lost on me, but I did start downloading some movies so that I can watch them offline for on an upcoming trip--being able to tune out your surroundings by diving into a movie is wonderful when stuck in those cramped airline seats.My video shows the unboxing and the Kindle Fire HDX in action.So to me, this tablet provides a big bang for your buck.", "Date": "October 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "BATTERY DOESNT LAST, AMAZON.COM SENDS REFURBISHED REPLACEMENT", "Author": "Jeanne D Day", "ReviewID": "R33FG0IPX75104", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This kindle fire HDX has not held a charge since it arrived early December.

Ricucci", "ReviewID": "R1DBW18TQ7Z7ED", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After 11 days of using the Kindle Fire HDX 7\", HDX Display, Wi-Fi, 32 GB -- and now editing slightly thanks to a couple of helpful Amazoners:What I LIKE about the HDX:- Slim, light, more mobile & easier to handle than the Fire HD which was heavy/unwieldy for my arthritic hands- Gorgeous display, crisp and beautiful- Easy setup, very simple even for a senior lady like me- This model includes a charger. Yay!! (The Fire HD did not come with a charger.)- Responds quickly, very intuitive- Email program is great, nicely laid out & easy to set up all my accounts -- my Mac account, my MS Exchange work account, my Gmail accounts- As an Amazon Prime member, I have a huge selection of movies, TV & music available at no additional cost- It's just a smooth operation, does what I want it to do simply and very quicklyWhat I DON'T LIKE about the HDX:- No way to know when device is fully charged; no green light as on other Kindles; you have to turn it on and unlock to see whether it's fully charged- Speakers on the back means you have to be careful and aware of which way you're holding the device so your hand isn't covering one of the speakers; I don't think the placement is all that great.- The micro USB port at the bottom, where you plug in the charger, is at an odd angle. Often when I go to charge the device, it takes me a couple of tries to get the plug into the port. Seems strange, something which could have been done better.I really like the Fire HDX, much better than the Fire HD and I know I will very much enjoy it. As an all-around device for music, videos, email, web browsing, games, keeping up with news/weather/sports on-the-go, etc., I can definitely recommend the HDX. It's not perfect (does anyone know a device which is?) but if the HDX does what you need, you will love it!UPDATE on 12/5/13 -- I've now had the device for about 6 weeks and am using it heavily, much more than my previous Kindle. It keeps surprising me in terms of the things it will do and the way it fits into my work & leisure needs. I don't know if I just got lucky, but I swear there is no blue haze on my screen. BOTTOM LINE: I'm very happy with the HDX. Now if I could just discipline myself to put it down....", "Date": "October 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Tablet For the Amazon Ecosystem", "Author": "Christopher", "ReviewID": "RBHK0EOJ7QRS5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I live in the Amazon Ecosystem.  I buy my movies from Amazon Instant Video, I pay for the Cloud Music service, and I've been a Kindle reader since the first generation.  I've had iPads, Nexus and Surface tablets, and while they offer most of the Amazon services through various Apps, none are as cohesive as the Kindle Fire.  I was hesitant to upgrade to this years model, as I absolutely loved the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 last year, but I wanted a smaller tablet, and the specs this time around were rather impressive.The first thing I noticed about the Kindle Fire HDX was not the screen (although it is rather impressive), but the weight.  Make no mistake, this tablet is thin, and this tablet is light.  It makes movie watching and reading a pleasure, even one handed for a long period of time.The screen - a nice upgrade over last years model, it's bright, vivid and the text is crisp, which is helpful, especially for reading.  I did not notice any blue hue that some people complain about.The sound - I didn't notice a huge quality difference over last year (and I liked last year's), but moving the speakers to the top of the device and slanting them makes a huge difference, especially since I hold my tablet and the bottom and would constantly cover last years.Speed - I noticed a huge speed increase over last years model.  The interface is fast and fluid, and I have not noticed any slow down so far.What I don't like, or what they could improve upon:Rear facing camera - I was hoping the 7\" model would have one like the 8.9, but not so.  I use my tablet for Skype so the grandparents can see their 2 year old grandchild, and it's much easier to use the rear camera to chase her around the room, so I was a little bummed about that.  Hopefully next year.HDMI out - I was disappointed to see it didn't make it into this years model.  I travel quite a bit, so it was nice to hook the Kindle Fire up to the Hotel's TV and relax at night.  I bought the NETGEAR PTV3000 to use the Miracast Feature, but it would have been nice to use the cable I already had.Apps - It has most of the ones I'd want on a tablet, but access to Google Play would be nice (without rooting)Long story short (too late), if you live in the Amazon Ecosystem, this is a great tablet, especially for the price.", "Date": "November 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "No Longer A Huge Fan of Amazon Nor Kindles", "Author": "HK", "ReviewID": "R2S0EAN0Y6ZSPX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This was my fifth kindle.  I have also owned the original kindle fire and loved it til it suddenly stopped charging- even after I was very careful in taking care of it and did not use it extensively.  Kindle support informed me that some of the original kindles had this issue.  When I heard the new kindle fire hdx was coming out I had high hopes that Amazon would have solved the issue of the battery port giving out prematurely, but within a month of receiving it, I started experiencing the same issue on my new kindle fire hdx!  Sometimes it would charge, other times it wouldn't.  I was so disappointed in this similar repeat of history, I decided that I would simply return it for a refund and not risk more money wasted, so I put it aside and stopped using it.  My biggest mistake was waiting for the hustle of the busy holidays to pass before calling Amazon thinking Amazon is so great with returns, another few weeks shouldn't be an issue!  My other mistake was not realizing the interpretation of their one year warranty was completely up to the whim of their representatives.  Their one year limited warranty states as some options, that a new device may be given as a replacement, and also that refunds may be given- and does not state when or when not.  I fully trusted that Amazon would come through for one of their loyal prime customers; I mean we've all read about Amazon's great customer service in the past and in others' reviews!  However, my New Year has now been completely soured by my latest experience with Amazon, and I will never view Amazon nor it's kindle products the same ever again.  On New Year's Day I called and asked for a refund because this had been my second experience with kindle fires having charging/ battery port issues, and it happening again to such a new product that had just came out- I didn't want an exchange until I was sure this would not happen again.  They refused me a refund because my thirty days had passed.  In the end after several more requests for a refund, I settled for an exchange of a product I no longer trusted in.  The order invoice said a new kindle hdx was on its way, and I was willing to give it a second try because what other option did I have?  I packed up my new condition kindle with its power charger and the original box- thinking what a shame- still brand new if it wasn't for the charging issue, and dropped it off at UPS.  Today the replacement arrived.  I was so disappointed and shocked to open the amazon box and find no packaging at all including, no original kindle box, and just a refurbished kindle without even a charger- just a dusty cord!!  I had sent everything that came with my kindle in its still new box back to Amazon!  Not only had I received a refurbished kindle as opposed to a new one when I had only owned my new generation kindle hdx for a little over two months (I received it at the end of October), but now I felt like I got an even shabbier deal because Amazon didn't even have the decency to  package my replacement in its original box with a fully working charger!  When I called customer service I was upset for the above reasons, and one of the kindle support reps spoke to me in a very patronizing tone and yelled at me and threatened to stop helping me if I continued to be upset.  The biggest reason for my upset and frustration was because I had really trusted that Amazon would be reasonable and willing to work with me and help me out.  Every time I was put on hold was a ten to twenty plus minutes wait and in the end, the \"higher ups\" were also completely unwilling to help me - still no refund or no promise of a new kindle, just \"a repeat of \"no we can't\" , \"no we can't\"... \"We can't issue a refund\"even though if I had received the new kindle just even a little later when it was expected to ship out, I may have qualified for the extended holiday return policy that starts with November shipments. The patronizing agent told me it was my fault for not reading the whole email sent with the label which would have told me to keep all of the accessories and only send the device- why would I keep the accessories when I thought I was getting a new replacement?!  And how is that ethical to keep part of the product? When I went back to my original email later, I did not see any small print about keeping the box and all the accessories, though I did fimd on the amazon website that it is not necessary to send in the charger or manual.  I would still think a refurbished electronic device would come paired with a charger if it was originally offered with the device?!  The friendlier agent I spoke with on New Year's promised that Amazon always takes care of its customers, so don't worry- if I have further issues with the replacement to just call back.  At that time, I ended the call still agreeing with him about Amazon looking out for its customers.  And even on that day, I had called - expecting a full refund, and though not getting it, believed Amazon would at least replace a two month old bestselling device with a new product for a very disappointed customer.  However, today after an hour long run around and dismissals and no one willing to truly work with me, I am no longer a fan of Amazon.  It's too bad because I used to rave about Amazon and kindles and what I believed was true about Amazon customer service being one of the best out there.  When customer service stops coming through for you or the company stops caring about its individual customers, it's time to stop believing in its products.", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Gorgeous device, but some things you should know....", "Author": "BarbZ", "ReviewID": "R2ROLCJAJ0O1C7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This device is a breathtaking movie watching device, but falls short in other areas.  Some will feel like \"nits,\" but I wanted to mention them, since they were surprising to me, and they are things you should know:Screen:  Gorgeous.  Movies are breathtaking, full of depth.Movie watching:  While watching a movie (streaming or downloaded), you can tap the screen, hold the progress bar, and scroll forward/backward in the film with a preview screen which shows you exactly where you'll land when you release your touch on the screen.  Great!  XRay for movies is also a nice feature, and in some cases, gives you \"goofs\", so you can check out the filming mistakes on your own!Sound: Incredible.  For movie viewing, this is really like having a mini theater in your lap.  I stand the device in an old Kindle Fire cover so that the sound is projected towards the front by the folded back cover.  It feels like you are in a theater.  This is the first device I've ever used (been satisfied with the sound) without headphones, and if you aim the sound toward you, it's stunning.  I've watched about four films, and I wouldn't think of using headphones with this device.Mayday: Great feature.  I used it twice.  I had an agent available in less than a minute, and they stuck with me until the issues were resolved.Setup/Glitches: I had one hang up/reboot.  Your device will do a software update while booting for the first time, which takes at least 10 minutes.  Note:  I have some video enhanced Kindle books.  They would not run on this device, however, they ran on my older Kindle Fire, hence one of my calls to Mayday.  I expect there will be some inconsistency in older/newer generation devices with some materials.Storage:  16G is really 10.6G, so expect it to go quickly.  I would order the 32G if I were ordering again.Downloads:  A nice feature.  I downloaded a couple of short television episodes in order to test this.  The downloads took longer than expected, however, based on my service and typical download times.Why I didn't give it five stars:The high definition of the device makes some text and images too small to see/read, so this is not a viable web browsing device for me.Integration/Intrusion: Great for Amazon, not so great for the user/device owner.  I'm very disappointed in one thing: When you download a book sample and try to read it, there is a yellow button in the bottom third of the screen that says:  Buy Now.  When you purchase a book, a bar/box appears across the bottom third of the screen (when reading) asking you to try the audiobook (similar button)...and the audiobook sample is already downloaded to your device!  This is:  1. very intrusive to the reading experience.  The bar/box blocks a portion of the book's text (the bottom third of the page).  You have to tap the screen to remove it.  Also, if each time you download a book, you are downloading an Audible sample, this is simply a sales tactic at the expense of unnecessary bloat to the storage on your device.  This is really disappointing from a company that understands exactly what the purity of a reading device should be. I find these sales pitches in the middle of my reading experience to be annoying!Reading:  Not great on this device.  There is a purplish border around the screen when reading which I find fatigues my eyes.  I read easily on my iPad, Kindle Fire Gen 2, even the new Paperwhite.  This will not be my first choice for a reading device.Form factor:  Very nice, and easy to hold, except for one thing:  the micro USB plug is at an angle to the device.  It is very difficult to insert the plug on my device, and also difficult to remove.  I'm not sure about the viability of that connector in light of the force needed to insert and remove it.No Battery Indicator light:  This may seem like a small thing, but I find it very annoying.  When you plug in the device, there is no indicator light to tell you when the battery is charged.  I couldn't believe it!  In order to know if the device is charged, you have to turn on the device, and check the screen.  I called Mayday to confirm this, since I simply thought I was missing it.  Now when I plug the device in, I check to see when the plug loses its heat to know that it's charged.  Seems ridiculous to me.Overall:It really depends on what you want to use this device for.  As a pure movie absorbing device, it's 6 stars!I recommend ordering with more memory.  I was going to order the Kindle Fire HD with 16G of storage.  Then, I realized that the price difference after upgrading the memory in the low end device was only $60 to the 7 inch HDX with 16G, so I decided to go with it, in light of the many other differences in the specs.  I think that was the right decision, but I don't expect the memory to go very far in light of the other issues I've mentioned.I need to do more reading, and check the device connector, and keep an eye on the memory before deciding whether or not to keep the device.

Kindle was already a part of my life, it made the books and therefore my contact with the English language (which is not my mother tongue) easier for me. Since I had so much personal content on it, I felt as if someone invaded my private life and totally messed up my little daily rituals.Although I reported it to the police and had Amazon freeze my old device for me (I can't thank them enough for their promptness), it did not turn up, so my husband and I decided to buy this new one. It has just arrived today, but from what I've seen so far this one is much, much better.My first impulse was to look at the books (by the way, it came with the majority of the books on my account already installed, which is again something I am thankful to Amazon for) and the screen seems better than the old one. To be honest, that was my main concern - I was a bit nervous as I knew it was smaller than my old Kindle Fire, but it turned out ok. I even went outside and read with the sunset reflecting on my screen and everything was easily readable.The second thing that I noticed about it was the speed - not only it's much faster and I downloaded all my music and some of my videos in a heart bit, but I'm also extremely happy that my Jillian Michaels exercise routines are downloadable and can be played off-line - now I will be less upset when our Internet company schedules their maintenance!The sound, as far as I'm concerned, is clear too, and I don't mind the way they put their off and on and volume buttons in the back - I got accustomed to them very quick.I also like the fact that the device is now compatible with Youtube videos, that used to be a constant source of frustration for me on the old one. Back then having a kindle seemed to me like setting your priorities - I wanted to choose my books over the youtube content, and I had to deal with not being able to play many other things. Now I don't have to make that choice anymore; this kindle incorporates the amazing Amazon reader and a tablet. That is very nice and I don't think there's anything similar on the market at the price!I haven't tried the apps or the games enough to comment on them, but I will update my review if I find it necessary. Maybe I'll find something negative to say, although that's very unlikely :PIn other words, thank you Amazon, I love my new device! I'm glad in a way that I had a reason to buy this one right off after it came out!Update 10.25.13: It's been two days since I got the Kindle and I'm still perfectly content with it. I've seen people around complaining about the blue / purple haze around its border - in all honesty, I had to read their reviews to realize it's there. And now that I see it, I think it really gives more depth to the screen. It doesn't impede my reading at all, on the contrary...I've also downloaded some of their games and apps and everything runs smoothly.I even used the Mayday button once; as I expected the Amazon specialist was impeccable in their reply and helped me immediately. However, the Kindle is so easy to use that there's almost no need for Mayday :)I still think this is the best device you can get out there for the price. Go for it and you won't regret it!Update: 11.06.2013 While trying to Skype on the new Kindle, I found out that this one is a little too sensitive to movement compared to the previous model. Every time I moved the camera it would make a clicky sound and the image would freeze. Somehow I have the feeling that the way it receives the Internet signal is slower or something of the sort. The former Kindle seemed a little better with that I didn't have any problems moving the camera while talking on Skype.", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sublime!", "Author": "Travel Fan", "ReviewID": "R2KDJ0C1SL0DHK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had a chance to enjoy my new Kindle HDX 64GB, Wi-Fi only for a few days now. The packaging was great and worry free. I could tell that Amazon took care to make sure that my new toy would arrive safely. My first Kindle was a keyboard kindle which I loved. However, when the previous generation HD came out, I could not resist the call to enjoy color again. I had missed seeing my book covers/pictures in color. I loved all the HD had to offer, the games, internet browsing and being able to check my email while on travel. It was a great little device, but alas, when the HDX came out, it just had a little more of what I was looking for. I bought it for the lighter weight, the extended battery life, higher resolution, etc.. the same reasons everyone else bought one. I traded in my HD with Amazon and this is where I have to praise Amazon for their excellent customer service. My mother had also asked me to trade in her HD along with mine, so we sent them in one package. We followed instructions, submitted the trade in and waited patiently. After two weeks, I could see that they had received the package, but nothing was happening. After contacting Amazon, they responded within the hour and discovered that apparently our items had somehow been lost. At any rate, they could see that they had been delivered and gave us an immediate provisional credit. Later, they did find one of the devices, but to make things right, they gave an additional credit for that item on top of letting us keep the full provisional credit for both devices. Now that is superior customer service! Hard to find that anymore. They were prompt, courteous, and resolved our issue (and I dealt with three different customer service reps). Anyway, on to the HDX. This is a spectacular little device. It is much lighter, more compact and easier to hold than my HD was. It is also quite a bit faster, whether checking email or browsing. I also enjoy my reading experience. Of course I have to mention the blue haze issue. After reading previous reviews, I have to admit that I was a little concerned. However, I need not have worried. It is a non issue to me personally, I had to look really hard to see it and I find that it is actually easier on my eyes than a stark white page. I do not see it at all when browsing or checking email. I have downloaded some music and find the sound quality to be at least as good as what I experienced on my previous gen HD. I can't wait to view my newly purchased HD LOTR trilogy on this device as the screen so far has been highly impressive. I also decided to purchase the HDX with 64 GB as I found that the 16GB in my previous device just wasn't enough to accommodate the downloading of several movies for when I travel. I would highly recommend the higher storage capacity for anyone who is wanting to download movies, especially those of HD quality. Also, I have used the charging port several times and have not been bothered with the angle at all. In fact, because of the angle, I have found it easier to plug in than with my last device because I had to hold that one exactly level in order for me to be able to insert the cord. I have only one more thing to say about the HDX and other Kindle tablets. They are not IPads, nor will they ever be IPads. If I had wanted a tablet with the features of an IPad, I would have bought an IPad. Thank goodness I do not want that, which means I can get everything I want for a lot less money than I would have had to spend on an IPad. I have more money to spend on stuff to put on my Kindle. This puts a smile on my face. Kindles are in a category all their own and I love them! Thanks Amazon---------------------------------------------------------Jan 26, 2014I would like to modify my previous review a bit. After using this device for a while, I still love it. However I have noticed considerable eyestrain when reading a book without a lamp at night. My eyes would burn and water. Since then, I have purchased a Paperwhite and have no more problems. So now I use my Paperwhite for reading, it is lighter weight anyway which is better for that purpose, and my HDX for everything else. When I travel though I will still just take my HDX for simplicity and the sync feature makes it easy to continue reading where I left off on my Paperwhite. I still consider both devices to be a good investment.", "Date": "October 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Mayday Saves the Day", "Author": "spark", "ReviewID": "R3SJPD6D5ZZV34", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I waited all day for my new Kindle HDX to arrive, When at 7:00 pm it came, I was already to manage, download and put it to a workout.

In the morning, I couldn't find the mayday button, couldn't get the Kindle to recognize my internet connection (which it had the night before)etc. Having purchased the 1st generation of each Kindle device made, I was ticked. Finally, was able to connect, through the \"help\" tab in Settings (which is not as easy to find as in older Kindle Fire) But, lo & behold, I got connected fairly quickly to Heather, a live Mayday tech. She recognized right away that there was a problem since there was no video feed. She had me \"update\" the system. And the update fixed all the problems I had encountered. During the update, the Kindle had disconnected from Mayday Heather, but when I tried Mayday again, I got Heather again( :-) )  and this time with video feed.

Sadly, it was not to be.  I assessed several different tablets, making charts on hardware, performance' pros & con's etc.  Here are the HDX's pros & con's and a footnote of why I ultimately chose another one.PROS ~AMAZING picture quality.  Color conformity was the best of any of the tablets in the running.  The Nexus 7 was a very close second but the HDX's black level added more depth.  Interestingly, you lose some of that brilliance if you go up from the 7 to the 8.9.Sound was the best of all tested models.  Excellent volume, base and clarity.The on/off & volume buttons take a little getting used to, but the dimensions and solid feeling of the device help you get used to their unusual placement.  I appreciated the non-slick, rubbery feel of the HDX's covering.The Mayday feature is a great addition, and I think other companies should follow suit.  I saved myself a lot of time just by asking them a 20 second question that might have taken me 10 minutes to find searching the web.The front camera was the hands down best out of the tested competition.  It looked like a regular camera picture.  Actually, if you could figure out how to maneuver it, good camera shots could be taken with the front camera.Connectivity to everything Amazon based was, of course,  excellent.The Silk browser works smoothly, but I missed features of other browsers.The sale price is 229 for a 32gb model was great.CONS ~The blue/purple \"frame\" around every white screen is not acceptable, should not have to be \"worked around\" and is definitely NOT normal, no matter how much Amazon wants you to think it is...I really do love Amazon, but I couldn't shake this Orwellian feeling that Amazon was Big Brother & the Mayday button was put there to spy on us. :-)  Seriously though, they lack flexibility and are \"android based\" but not a fully functional android.  Picture a bird with some feathers clipped so they can't fly.If I fully understood what it meant to have NO access to Google play store, I would have considered more carefully.  It's not like comparing apples to oranges.  Well, in this case apples to androids to kindles.  Yes, they are trying to improve their app library, but they have a LONG way to go.  On a side note, I found it frustrating to not be able to use the same apps as my friends & family.Although the readability initially seems great (esp if you go to black with white writing to ignore the purple frame), you don't want to compare it with the HDX 8.9.  Side by side the 7's reading screen on white looked \"dirty\" compared to the 8.9's crisp whiteness (same purple haze on both sadly).  I kept checking the 7's settings to make certain it wasn't on sepia.IN A NUTSHELL ~I wanted to choose the HDX, loved the movie experience on it, albeit at 7 inches.  It felt wonderful to hold & performed almost seamlessly.  But I could not overcome the flaws in our relationship.I want to read books on a crisp white screen with no blue/purple border.I want access to ALL things android, apps, browsers, features, not just \"Amazon android\".I finally settled on a very close second with the Nexus 7.  I'm still getting used to the feel of it but a case makes it feel sturdier. I did, however, have no trouble getting used to having all those endless apps available to me again.Hope you all find joy this season in your tablet search!UPDATE 5/28/14Well, I returned the Kindle and kept the Nexus. After awhile I missed the Kindle so much that I bought another one on a huge sale day. I LOVE my Kindle, accept it's limitations and do the unavailable android things I need to do on my phone.The Nexus became the teenagers tablet. It never felt \"good\" in my hands. After 6 months it died. Asus customer support was straightforward enough and they paid for shipping to the warranty dept. But now, it's been over 2 weeks since they received it and I still don't have a working tablet. No updates either. I had to hunt it down online to find out that it's status was \"still in repair\".If it were MY tablet and not my teens, I'd be going nuts. ;)So, I'm happy with my Kindle but probably wouldn't be if I didn't have my Galaxy phone to get my android app fix.", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Horrible Purple Blue Hue Along Edges Very Obvious!", "Author": "Gregory G.", "ReviewID": "R2BB6E6JP37KMQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "So far not happy at all with a product that almost cost me $300.00 and has a HORRIBLE VERY OBVIOUS blue/purple line that goes alone the whole screen on both sides.

My fault for not fully understanding its limitations But...", "Author": "Bob \"Bob in Big Bear Ca\"", "ReviewID": "R1EMZBVAQM3X7L", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "5/11/14 Update:Having had the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" for a couple of months now, my experience with this device has me convinced that there are much better options available a within the same price range.I'll go over some of the ground that I wrote in my full review below, but feel those things that I do go over are important considerations in determining whether or not the Kindle will work for you so I'll be going over the most important points here as well.First off the display.While the display looks great in general, I am a little disappointed with the brightness of the display when outdoors. I do not have another tab to use as a reference to compare it with other right now, but when comparing my cellphone (which is at least as bright as the Kindle) it seems to me they could have done something to improve the lighting for outdoors. The color saturation is very good, especially in gaming, but might have a little too much color contrast for some when watching video. When I have used it to watch movies or TV provided using Netflix or my Prime Membership, I've found that video sometimes lags. The lag could be a result of several things, including the hardware or system resources provided on this device. I have 3 computers at home and a Blue Ray player that all stream Prime Instant video, and none of the other devices have similar issues. Let me rephrase that comment. I have seen Prime lock up and lag on all the devices I own, but none of the others have the severity or frequency of problems the Kindle has. Again I would guess it's a lack system resources or possibly a hardware issue.The Flexibility of the Kindle:In terms of flexibility I guess this could be seen as subjective. Here's what I've found to be the problem with the Kindles Flexibility and one of the outstanding issues I've found with it.Amazon had set up packet blocking and redirect on their devices. This means the Kindle will not stream other media from sources. For instance I have an account with Google where I have about 130 Gigs of music stored. My media is stored there free of charge and supports large and various file formats. Though it is a competitor of Amazons Google Play does not block or redirect when you try to access media stored elsewhere. Amazon on the other hand has blocked or diverted most other devices using the Android UI or Android variant from accessing Prime Instant Video. I can access the small amount of music I have stored in Amazons cloud, but Video is blocked. Yes I can access Netflix, and YouTube. There are some sites where the Kindle will either lock up, or be redirected somewhere else. BTW YouTube streams pretty well, but not as smoothly as my 2 year old Droid does though.So four month over all opinion of the Kindle, is that it that if you want a semi-flexible E-Reader this might be a good choice for you. In my case I've found the Kindle to be too limited and it's fallen short of my expectations, and that's even comparing it to my cellphone. The lack of onboard storage (which was promoted earlier on as a none issue for modern users) has turned a real problem and the 16GB version actually leaves the user with closer to 8 or 9GB than the 16GB advertised. It does play some games well, but it has more limitations than implied (the 32GB or larger versions might be able to handle graphics better but...) It will stream Amazons Prime or Netflix Video pretty well, but music outside of Amazons services is a problem. The fact that Amazon begins charging to store music on their site after a certain point seems ridiculous, and they do drop music that you've purchased from their site unless you purchase more space. I feel that Amazon charging to store music that you've bought from them is greedy, but especially since other sites (sites like Google Play) allow free uploading and storage huge amounts of personal music and media.5/11/14...When I decided to purchase the Kindle HDX. I had been looking at several tablets closely for the past few months to use while I was away from home on an upcoming trip expected to last few weeks. And seeing the current price and purchasing options available the Kindle HDX seemed to be an easy choice to me.  Even with my thinking I understood the tablets limitations.The things that attracted me to the Kindle HDX tab, were the processor, it's 4 G LTE compatibility with Verizon, and the fact that I am an Amazon Prime member. I had read that Amazon was expecting people to use their online services for video and music so having membership I was not too concerned about the small amount of storage on the tablet. But that was a mistake on my part. I was thinking I would be able to access the movies that I purchased online with Amazons instant video, and expected to be able to access the 128 gigs of music I have stored on Google Play\", but Google Play media will not load on my Kindle HDX. Amazons cloud does store music up to a point, but it is limited in how much you can store free of charge.  There is an option to purchase additional storage, (I believe it's about $25 a year with other limitations). But the free storage is limited and in my case I've been buying music from Amazon since the 1990's and a lot of my music was displaced by newer purchases without my knowing. So now I'm forced to either purchase additional space or be satisfied with what's there. Personally I feel the additional $25 is a rip off since particularly since the purchase of the kindle and considering my Prime membership, and with other services offer free unlimited uploads of music Amazon seems pretty greedy at this pont.Here are the things I like about the current Kindle HDX Verizon compatible version.1. The processor, it is very fast and loads pages quickly, and the 2 gigs of ram is a respectable amount to assist in performance.2. The variables in personal settings, make the device easy to personalize.3. The display is very nice and video and video games look great, but noting as others have there is a blue cast around the edges which is very noticeable when reading from the device.The not so great things about the Kindle HDX 16 GB.1. The fact that the device does not support storage expansion. It bothers me that my old Droid Bionic cell phone has a SanDisk slot that will let me to expand storage to 64 gigs, but you're stuck with the memory provided on the Kindle you purchase.2. The lack of an HDMI port and to watch TV, you have to purchase a separate device provided and sold by Amazon.3. The Lack of even a mini USB port. Again my old Droid telephone provides a USB port and offers a charging device with a built in USB hub that allows me to connect to any number of external attachments, and this tablet does not.Regretfully the impact of these limitations did not come to mind when I bought the Kindle, but would have if I knew the fully understood the tablets limitations.Would I recommend this tablet to friends or family? Only if they were a member of Amazons Prime services and fully understood its limitations, including storage and the area support of their carrier.So over all, for basic users or those wanting a reading device with very nice options living in an area with Wi-Fi and who have good 4 G coverage the Kindle would probably be an OK purchase. But only if they are fully aware of the limitations of this tablet. Especially the limitations of the tablets onboard storage. 16 gigs is just too little to carry much media with you, with the device using a large part of that 16 gigs, for it's UI and OS you are not even getting a full 16 gigs (more like 10). Then tablet not supporting SanDisk memory expansion (which seems contrived to me), leaves the user too dependent on Amazons premium services for my tastes.(Update 4/14/14) The packet blocking used to keep people tied to Amazons Media Content (or at least their Music App) needs to be removed. In my review above, I mentioned that I have had issues accessing my music stored on My Google Play Music site. But at that time I wasn't sure that this was my being impatient, not waiting for the site to load completely even though I did wait for five minutes, or if it was Amazon using packet blocking and redirection to keep people tied to their services. More recently I found that when trying to access my music on the Google site I was redirected to  the \" My Books Recommendations\". I believe the Kindle site offers better deals, and has a wider selection than Googles offerings, but Googles music site includes downloads at the same cost and higher resolution (320 Kbps vs. the 190-240 Kbps at Amazon). More over recently a few friends told me they have run into the same issue when trying to access their media stored at other various sites (that are either free or that do not charge what Amazon does for their \"Premium Cloud Services\").As someone else has mentioned in their review of the Kindle. Amazon has included adds on the Kindle HDX that are not present on other tablets (even basic inexpensive Android tablets do not have invasive adds). If I pay Amazon another fee I understand I can have those adds removed. But all of these fees really add up, and it seems to me that since I've already paid for this device, these additional fee's, and packet blocking with proprietary redirection are unacceptable and possibly illegal. Who Gives amazon the right to block content and force you to view advertisements on a device of this nature!At this point I would honestly suggest looking elsewhere unless your absolutely sure that the problems mentioned above will not come into play for you or the one you are purchasing this device for. The idea of an e-reader with expanded abilities is one thing, but to advertise the Kindle HDX as a tablet able to compete with an I-Pad, and then throw things like site redirection, packet blocking to limit access media storage to their proprietary services makes me wish I had purchased anything other than this device.", "Date": "March 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Happy with it, especially for the price", "Author": "MichaelB", "ReviewID": "R2Y0383TNKPC18", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was debating between Ipad mini and this HDX 7. My home computer is a Mac and my music, contacts and calendar are all on the Mac. I read by eBooks on Kindle touch and like to watch Amazon prime movies. So I am sort of in two worlds. At the end of the day I opted to give this a try based upon price (I got the 15% off price when Amazon had the FAA thank you special). So what do I think, well if you are used to Mac products it is hard to beat their ease of use and how you just plug it in and all your stuff automatically synchs up. The Kindle fire took me a bit to organize and set up although it was nice that all of my books came over from my Touch to the HDX, although they are placed in the Cloud and you have to download the ones you want on your device. Also any books you set up yourself go to your documents tab and not the books tab. I dealt with calendar problem by exporting Ical into Google calendar which does automatically import to the HDX calendar. I was sort of annoyed that you had to buy basic applications that come with an Ipad such as clock and notepad. Since there are several options for these you have to hunt around, read reviews etc. Also - \"free aps\" all come with ads, which is sort of annoying so I would recommend you consider getting the \"upgraded versions\" to avoid ads. Several people have complained about the light blue border on the reader - I noticed it but got quickly used to it and it does not bother me. Watching movies works for me - the 7\" screen is probably similar to watching a movie in the seat back screens of an airplane.

Last May, I abandoned my first generation Kindle Fire for a brief affair with an Asus Google Nexus tablet. Sure, it was good looking and seemed to work just fine but in the end it left me feeling empty and cold...and feeling guilty for cheating on Amazon just because there's no Microsoft OneNote app available for Kindle. Four months of very little Amazon love had me begging to come back - and when the HDX was announced, I found my chance and grabbed one. I'll learn to love the Evernote app instead of OneNote, but please never separate me from Amazon again. \u00a2\u00beThe display is breathtakingly sharp and beautiful. It's such a great picture that I had trouble focusing on the movie because I was in awe over how clear and sharp the image on the screen was. Hubby caught me staring at it with my yap wide open, a frozen expression of awe on my face. (I think he might have been a little too happy to find me speechless.)The sound is phenomenal, especially for such a little device. I really didn't think there would be much difference between the Google 7 tablet mentioned above and the Kindle Fire HDX but there is a HUGE difference. I'm so glad. This little bad boy puts all other tablets to shame. When the sound started playing out the speakers I flipped it over and started looking for them...I have no idea why or what I expected to find, but the amazing quality of sound blew me away. It was almost surround sound-ish, if you know what I mean.The Fire works the same as I remember with my first one. There's a carousel containing your most recently viewed content and a favorites section below. I wish there was a way to store my content in categories like the old Kindle Keyboard. I miss being able to put all my reference books together, all my fiction together, and so on - but I'm told that there's a software update coming in mid-November that will allow us to do just that. Again...I love you, Amazon!I bought the Fire with ads on it, which isn't like it sounds at all. There are no pop ups in the middle of what you're reading/doing/watching. The screensaver provides suggestions is all. That's it. And there's a very tiny window underneath the carousel that suggests content similar to what you're reading/doing/watching already. I actually like it...because I might miss something otherwise. It's very non-intrusive (is that a word?) and I have no issues with it.Ease of set up is amazing as always. Amazon is truly a customer friendly company and I will never stray again. I am so happy to be back in the fold of happy Amazon customers. This is the best purchase I've made all year.

It is lighter and thinner than the old ones. I borrowed my Neighbors HD and was not a fan. This feels really good in your hand and the screen is BEAUTIFUL. Operates fast and smooth. Has almost all of the apps I want, and all of the apps my wife ever needs (I'm a nerd who uses a few apps that are obscure).Screen:Responsive, bright, crisp, great viewing angle. I did not see a blue outline that some have reported. Plenty of pixels per inch to look great.Speakers:Having not owned a tablet with stereo speakers, this thing blows my mind. Sound is really good (not home theater quality or anything) but better than any phone I've heard. Stereo really improves the experience with videos, more than I expectedMayday:Used it once so far. Took 5 seconds to connect. The young lady was helpful and courteous, and answered my question (downloading a prime movie to my HDX for offline viewing) quickly. Turned out that the movie I was looking at was not licensed for that yet, but they were working on improving the selection of these things. Kind of a bummer, but it's day one so I expect the content to grow.

Responsive. Runs games, or video streaming, HD TV streaming - with no lags.**DesignThat hardly depends on personal taste. Myself I like it. Easy to hold even with one hand. Not slippy. Light. Good thing is that Power and Audio buttons are well situated. If you hold HDX and watch something, or listening music while reading and wish to adjust volume - easy to find buttons as your fingers are exactly there.**Screen/Reading experienceIt is marvelous for reading. I do have Kindle reader as well and mostly read on it, but sometimes have to use Kindle Fire - for EPUBS f/e and I should say KF HDX screen is amazing step ahead. Of course, for reading not as good as EInk screens, but really better than reading on smartphone  or IPad Mini or Notebook. Do not have Nexus, thus can say nothing about. Can't compare here.Only bad thing with this screen is that it's glossy. Terribly glossy. If you love dark backgrounds and pick that option in apps, or if you read and prefer white letters/black background - forget about. You would see yourself in the screen like in a mirror. But for white (or any light) background/black letter thing - as I have said above reading experience is superb!Of course for movies and games HDX screen is superb as well. Rich and bright,  well calibrated.  Vivid colors. No complains here.I do have some applications for note-taking (handwriting) like 7Notes and HDX is good for that. With a stylus you can take notes or draw something - would not say that's exactly like if you have a pen and paper but quite close.**AudioSpeakers are well situated so you never hold it with your hand. And the audio is good - loud and clear. I do also have bluetooth speakers but no real need to use them. Well, maybe somewhere in a noisy environment.Back, where speakers are located has an angle and that's smart - if you lay HDX on table, speakers are not covered and audio is good.**BatteryHolds about 10-11 hours (Amazon says 11). But when you read, it automatically picks energysave regime, well done! Nice option really and very useful.Charging takes about 6 hours. Bit less.But HDX charger output is 1A, when HDX can be charged at 1.8A - thus, better to use other charger it would be fast. F/e 1st Gen KF charger output is exactly 1.8A.**Web browsingWith double antenna it finds Wi-Fi easily and holds it well.Silk browser is getting better. Works well, quick enough but still below Chrome. Of course Silk is the only browser on Amazon appstore, but sideloading is possible. :)Streaming is smooth. You can watch online TV from some other web-servers, of course watch Youtube, Dailymotion... No lags. If you have access to some HD TV online broadcast services - HDX is good for that as well. Buffering is very quick and after it goes like a charm. HDX great hardware gives you all benefits here.**HDX Keyboard/FontsYou can read books, surf web in any (or almost any? - don't want to make a mistake) language and you can type as well as HDX new keyboard gives an option to download lots of additional languages. And keyboard supports path-tracing like Swype. Works really well. If you love Swype keyboard, HDX one is close to that standard.**EcosystemDepends you are a long-time Amazon customer or new here. Are you a Prime member or not. Myself I am with Amazon for several years now. Buy from e-shop, also reading on Kindle (reader), later when they release KF tablet I got it... thus, HDX integration with Amazon services is an important thing for me. You access all your books. All your documents you store with Amazon. Cloud Drive is integrated. Videos, music streaming. You can now download Prime videos as well.Needless to say, that buying from Amazon e-shop or siblings like Zappos or MyHabit is easy and nice.As for apps - of course Amazon Appstore is way behind it's e-shop. You may not find lots of applications you wish to have. Hope Amazon would work here and call more developers. But again - don't forget, you can find an application somewhere else and sideload to HDX. Of course - that's not an ideal, but still a solution sometimes.And MayDay. 24/7 Online support. Have not used it yet. :) But that may be helpful when you need.**Cons/Things you should consider, while orderingTraditionally: No Google Play (but some Google apps like Calendar, Music or Gmail can be sideloaded and work - pls., see comments for details). But you know, what you buy.No rare camera but for me that was not crucial while making a decision as I do not really gonna to use it having smartphone with better camera.As for blue light around screen edges - lots of people do complain. For my eyes that's barely noticeable and not irritating while reading or browsing.If you refer to \"We want you to know...\" topic on HDX page, Amazon says, that \"All displays have some level of light emission around the edges... Most LCD displays use white LEDs. To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7\" at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20% improvement in power efficiency.\"Thus, if you buy HDX, you have to live with blue glow. Future software updates would leave that intact I guess.Fire OS is almost no Android OS. Hard to feel Android here. And native launcher is much different from any other Android launcher. If HDX is not your first KF - than you know it, but if HDX is your first tablet form Amazon, you may feel lost from the beginning.  I felt this way when I received my 1st Gen. KF... finally I ended installing an alternative launcher. Sorry, Amazon. :)But I should say, that for HDX Amazon made some nice changes - f/e option to see apps. in greed view. That's nice.**Special offersYou see Ad ONLY on lock screen, as soon you slide to unlock - ad banner disappears. Not annoying at all IMHO.In conclusion - great hardware, well build and if you are with Amazon ecosystem and do not need Google Play etc. - this is an extremely nice tablet.___Accessories:**CaseJust got Slimline Case from Poetic (which is on sale right now on Amazon). Fits HDX well. Awakes tablet when opened, like Origami case does. Very good one.**OTG/BluetoothNo surprise, but in case you wonder - no flash drive supported via OTG but I tried to connect HDX and my smartphone via bluetooth and it works.", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire HDX 7\", HDX Display, Wi-Fi, 32 GB - Includes Special Offers", "Author": "Bruno F.

The screen is beautiful. It has 323 pixels per inch as opposed to 216 for the HD. Apparently 107 pixels per inch is enough to bring a device from high definition into extreme high definition.Whatever the numbers really mean doesn't mean a whole lot to most people. This screen is dazzling and it will not disappoint you.StorageA 16 gig HDD isn't too terrible for something that costs $229. The main issue here is that if you intend to use the feature allowing you to store 1080p movies then those 16 gigabytes will fill up rather quickly. It is also apparent that the operating system and support software will also take up a portion of that 16 gigabytes. As with nearly all devices of this type one can assume that it is likely that you will never be able to increase the size of this hard drive.Form FactorKindle Fires have always been build like a tank. They were able to take a beating and are more difficult to crack than other screen-based items. Unfortunately, this comes with the price that the Kindle Fire was rather bulky and clunky. This time around we get a nice slim device that also seems durable. It is comfortable to hold in your hand without feeling cheap. The width went from 0.9 inches to 0.6 inches (33% thinner!) and the weight went from .86 pounds to .66 pounds.New Operating systemRecently, the Kindle Fire operating system has started to become a bit more difficult to use. Things seems to be a little bit less user friendly, though it did have a lot more features. I got to see an older generation in my family struggle when the OS got an upgrade for the Kindle Fire HD.The New Operating System is called Mojito and it is based on androids JellyBean. This feels more iterative than a revamp but some things about it definitely work. You still have the carousel with Mojito, but you can view more apps at once which definitely makes this feature more usable. Silk now feels like something I might actually want to use. I feel that this has has the biggest upgrade with the new operating system. The Keyboard here feels much smoother and pages definitely seem to have loaded faster (though i guess i should thank the increased specs for that one). This is also helped along by the fact that the touch screen is far more accurate. I can't be certain of who to thank but this is definitely a smoother, more pleasurable experience.New FeaturesAs we know there are many things to like about amazons Kindle. People can go back and forth comparing the size, quality, and price of this item to that of an iPad. Here are a few argument winners that will help to sway people into the Amazon ecosystem.Prime Viewing...now watch Prime without internetYou will now be able to download amazon prime content directly to the hard drive of your Kindle. This means you can enjoy a long car trip or a plane ride without using 3G service. This is a great upgrade and truly has this item stand apart.X-RAY just got better (sorta)Now with X-RAY you can bring up imdb.com information on people that have just come into the screen. This is partly and old feature but it will become new again with trivia. This is just the trivia that is already provided on the imdb.com website, but it is a fun addition. There are also instances where you can follow certain lyrics line by line. At the time of the review I have yet to try out this feature.The idea of adding more to X-RAY is nice. Anything that makes watching a movie more immerse is a good thing. Unfortunately, this kinda feels like something that you will forget about very quickly. Though, there is a push for this kind of content nowadays (SmartGlass) so maybe it could become something we all naturally all use, time will tell i supposeMaydayTo me, this is the thing that really drew my attention.  This is definitely something that is meant to be used by my parents but it gives a warm to the product. A savy electronics user may never need to use Mayday in order to find out where the home button is but it would be fantastic if this type of feature is forever integrated into devices by other companies. Hopefully, this free service will be a game-changer for customer service.Why Only Four Stars? (small drawbacks)The new Kindle Fire HDX is a fantastic piece of hardware. It is light, beautiful, and fast. Unfortunately, this device feels as locked down as previous Kindle Fire models.The the entire Kindle Fire line boasts that it is compatible with 80,000 apps. This number looks really high but there are nearly 10x as many apps on the android store that are not compatible with the Kindle Fire. Kindle items are Android devices of sorts, why can't they run every app available?In addition to this there still does not seem to be any way to create your own home screen wallpaper. I have seen with previous devices that even with the ads turned off you still cannot choose your own home screen. The images they have provided are stunning, yet there is no customization. There should at least be a way to set your home screen to reflect the image of the book you have most recently read.Holding the device is wonderful, it is light and the face of the device is beautiful. The back has a rubber touch to it and the side has a nice angle to it. The power button and the volume rocker are on this angled surface which is nice, but it's not entirely impossible to feel a bit uncomfortable at first. One thing that is curious to me is that the speakers have been moved to the back. They have a nicer speaker set this time around but it seems unusual to me to be projecting that backward. In addition to this is seems possible to me that some people might naturally want to hold the device with their fingers covering these speaker holes. Clearly, these are minor issues that may not amount to much once you get accustomed to it.If you have come to this page looking for a way to figure out if you should get the 7\" or the 8.9\" I have one insight for you. I have never held the 8.9\" but one instant difference is that the larger device has a rear facing camera. This wouldn't be a deal-breaker for me but i thought it might be important to note this.These few issues are very petty and, in the long run, they are insignificant. I am just shocked that such a fantastic device has such unusual restrictions. I cannot imagine that this would ruin the device for any buyer, but I felt it would only be fair to make you aware.This device is beautiful and deserves a spot in your home if you are looking for an upgrade. I love the look and feel of this device, I will just be sitting here hoping that the next time around we get a stock android device, though maybe I should just be happy that this thing will keep a huge smile on my face for a very long time.", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire HDX 7\" 64GB and Prime downloads \"SPOILER\"", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Usagi Driver\"", "ReviewID": "R3TQF9CKUT20N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The HDX is magnificent, just read all the raves.

The design, the weight, the very easy and straightforward UI, and the reading experience. When you pick up the device for the first time  it feels really solid and not too heavy like the Kindle fire HD did. The software and user interface is really smooth and doesn't stutter. Unlike android tablets I didn't feel overwhelmed at all and it's just extremely easy to grasp and navigate. Without the official cover, I found the back buttons confusing to use, and even then it wasn't much better because it was annoying to reach behind the flap and press on the button I needed every time. Here are my other thoughts on this device:ReadingThe reading experience is really great, but just keep in mind that the borders of the screen have a light blue hue to it, which is apparently normal and didn't annoy me. Super crisp text, different fonts, different highlighted colors and the text to speech voice along with buying audiobooks to read along is great. As a matter of fact, I put the device to sleep and had it read me a number of books a few times. The text to speech feels really natural and I would imagine this being a selling point for some since the e-ink readers no longer provide this feature. The only issue I have right now is that it doesn't provide collections like the iOS app does, but from what I understand it's coming in a future update.Video/audioThe videos look and sound fantastic, and the stereo speakers are good enough to the point where I don't even need to use my Jambox blueooth speaker like I did for my iPads. Netflix, Amazon Prime videos, Hulu and even the CW app (I'm addicted to this show called the The Tomorrow People) are all there. Now, if you're a youtube fan DO NOT expect a good experience for this because it's currently only done on the mobile web. The pictures on the Kindle Fire HDX page show an integrated app, so that's either incorrect or I'm guessing it's not complete yet. The mobile web is not a great experience because you can't easily view your favorites and it's just not as good as using a native app. And sideloading (which I'll talk more about later) the app doesn't let you log into youtube because the logon needs to work with a unmodified Android UI device.Web BrowsingIt's very fast and smooth, but i t only lets you have about 5 tabs at once. This is the first Amazon Silk browser that's given me a good experience to the point where I didn't think I needed to sideload a faster browser. I like how you can default it to pick to load either a full webpage or mobile site. This is great for casual browsing but I'm a big tab and web surfer so I really would've preferred using chrome and all my saved bookmarks there.AppsIf you don't have any specific app you need in mind then the selection is pretty good. It has a lot of the major ones out there but some of the ones missing in the amazon app store like dropbox and instagram aren't there. You can however sideload them :) The games run super smooth on this device thanks to the state of the art Snapdragon 800 processor but don't expect any big android game launches to appear on this device right away. The last big one is Dead Trigger 2 which still hasn't appeared in the amazon app store yet.Battery lifeLike my previous generation Kindle Fires, not good at all in my experience. It charges a lot faster than the older generations, but I average about maybe 5ish hours for this device, and that's with either no or occasional video. I never had this issue with my iPads, but I always feel like I'm charging the Kindle Fires more than I'm using them.Final thoughts and opinionsNotice how I mentioned sideload a few times in this review. I honestly think if you want to take full advantage of what the tablet offers (and tinker around with it), then this might not be for you. It's designed (and designed to make money off of) for people who only stick to the amazon ecosystem and do a fair amount of reading. As much as I enjoyed using the device, I realized that the Nexus  7 would be a better fit for my needs. I can do without the text to speech and settle for a 3rd rate Kindle reading experience (it's much better on iOS) where I can't change the text, do X-ray or view popular highlights. I do have a Paperwhite so I'm fine without having this on my tablet. I guess the more I used my HDX, the less I was interesting in reading because it was able to do so much more than that. I returned my HDX today for the Nexus 7 and even though it's a bit more underpowered, I'm happy with owning an Android tablet that gives me full access to android apps via the play store. For everyone else, this is a great purchase anyone who doesn't mind the amazon ecosystem and loves shopping on amazon while taking advantage of their prime membership.

There is a bizarrely angled port for the power charger, in that it does not sit flush with the Fire, and you kinda have to keep this in mind when plugging it in. I am mildly concerned that the power cable will experience stress, especially in a situation when I am using it while charging it. It just seems like a weird thing.Setting it up was pretty easy, just a few steps, log in to your Amazon account, and it automatically populates the carousel with my recently read books, in the proper order. I used the Silk browser for a while, and it is very nice; it is a full blown browser, not the \"mobile\" browser that I've seen on various Android devices. Pinch-n-zoom, slide-n-scroll, all the navigation people are probably already familiar with. If not, it doesn't take long to get used to it.I did look at some prior reviews just now, and see a lot of people mention the \"purple haze\", and unfortunately for me, now that I've read about it, I see the same effect on my HDX. It is mostly apparent in certain lighting situations, such as the reading books, when the screen is mostly white. I watched several hours of anime and did not notice anything at the time. It does not seem to be apparent on the home screen or a few other places, which makes me wonder if this is just a possible software fix.Battery life seems pretty good. When I first got it out of the box, it was at 60% charge, and it did not take very long to top it off. I did not time anything, so I can only offer subjective impressions. I watched at least 18 25-minute videos before I felt the battery was depleted enough to need a recharge, but it was not less than 25%, and I could have squeaked more non-video usage out of it.Speaking of video, this new HDX has the option to download Prime videos. I mean, you can watch them for free via Prime, but to actually download them? That's a new thing on me. I ended up downloading 14 episodes, one right after the other. Those videos take up a bit under 2gb of memory. Seems pretty good.Edit: I forgot to mention that the speakers are very nice compared to the original Fire. While using the first-gen Fire to watch videos, one of the first things I felt I needed was a set of external speakers. Once you start adding external accessories to a supposedly portable device, well, you kinda lose something in that process. The HDX speakers are very nice, crisp and loud enough that I don't feel the need for external speakers.The video app is very fickle for me. I selected the series I wanted to watch, which was an anime with 25 episodes. After watching two in a row, I need to take a break, so I put the HDX down on the table and come back in an hour or so. Restarting the HDX shows the series on the carousal, but when I click on the icon, it gives me a spinning cursor icon and waits forever, and never actually loads the video list. I timed 10 minutes on this behavior once. I've tried disconnecting/reconnecting to wi-fi, rebooting, etc, and can't determine why this happens. And it _only_ happens with the video app. Everything else is snappy as I could hope. I know it is not my WiFi, which is a dual-band BG/N router. Connecting at N speeds, I get 75% signal strength. Dropping down to BG speeds gives me full strength. But either way, signal strength is strong enough, and everything else works as expected, so that I know it is not latency that causes this. It is something with the way Amazon remembers where I stopped off, caching my last viewed video and position in the video. Even going into the previously downloaded content exhibits this behavior.Edit: if I force-kill the Amazon Video app, this behavior is no longer apparent, so I still feel confident in my suspicion that it is something software-wise, or something with Amazon's services, and unrelated to user error.So long story short, I find it is a minor flawed upgrade, but one still worth perusing.", "Date": "October 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Upgrade from the HD", "Author": "Willy Wailer", "ReviewID": "RMP1TPKL887RJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my 6th Kindle and my third Fire having started with the original.

Very annoying when trying to read a book. I will likely be returning this; I paid $324 for this and that is just too much money to justify a design flaw. I had such excitement and hopes for the HDX. I really wanted to like this small lighter weight tablet, hoping I could use it for a color ereader. But not at the price with such a design flaw. I don't trust a replacement unit to be sent considering how widespread this problem seems to be, as any replacement unit I were to get might start showing the purple after the window for returning it were to close. Sigh. It is a nice little tablet otherwise, or so it appears, but I can not justify 3 stars (\"Okay\") because it is not okay to pay $324 and be stuck with a tablet ereader with purple-blue glowing all around the ebook page edge.EDIT: I just boxed up the HDX and will be returning it tomorrow. I also noticed that blue/purple fringe on webpages, again very annoying. Also the page curl feature when turning pages of an ebook was not working-- yes i had that setting turned on (I checked) and yes i tried it on about six random ebooks of mine that I purchased through amazon. I checked other [non-kindle] tablets at the local store today and they did not have that blue fringe glow, in fact the original Kindle HD was a clean white; seems to be in the HDX line as well as the Kindle Paperwhite (which as I said I decided to keep as it is so lightweight and I like the backlighting).

I own a Note 3, MSI GT70, Ipad4, Note 10.1 2014, and a few older tablets for reading including an underwhelming 2012 HD refurbished Kindle. I was annoyed with the old HD for many reasons and was going to return it until my son stole it for Kindle Free Time, which btw, is worth the subscription. However, as many people do who don't have multiple screen homes (Kindle HD 2012 was first and only at the time) I was annoyed by its limits and didn't see it's merits.Even with my plethora of fancy and infancy devices I missed Amazon's set up for books and video streaming. I could have got the all new version of the HD cheaply but I thought for a few dollars more having the most recent Kindle would've hurt, would have all the product support (os updates, lending library, and Prime HD streams). However, what I didn't know about was the free Prime downloads they added!!!!!Unfortunately this feature will only be amazingly useful on Kindle with higher memory. It makes me want to cry. :( If you want to store your music and have up to four or so 1080p movies downloaded for offline use 16 gigs is too small. It's the case for any tablet, and to be honest 32 is really very little. The os your apps and games will eat that space in no time. It's not like the olden days.Aside from the os eating all my space, I have to say if you're a Prime Member the HDX is a need. It's so lovely watching videos for free that were optimized for your device in impressive full 1080p. I had no idea how useful this would be for more than a bedside companion. No 4G or purchases necessary to enjoy a show while you're waiting at the doctor. In that respect alone, if you're a loyal Amazon subscriber regardless of the tablet this is a no brained thing you will enjoy.The old HD lags and is slow, but this model is fast. You can write accurately and with ease. The battery life might make you sad, but if you're reading I believe you have 17 hours. Which, is totally why you own a fire right? ;)The app store is still limited, and behind ios and android in updates and releases, but Amazon is working on getting exclusive games for its tablet owners like the Telltale Walking Dead series. Which is amazing...I'm pregnant and struggling with a lot of physical issues and have been confined to my bed so gadgets have become very important. I doubt I could rationalize spending $300 of tech money on an 8.9 or even a 7 inch HDX when for that I could purchase a Nexus 10 or 7, or even a used retina ipad mini, but I can't say I don't want one. (There is one on my wishlist).If you're new to technology and tablets you will love an HDX, if you're a loyal Amazon Prime fan and use their wonderful services then you will enjoy this. It's fast. So fast, and streams in true HD with proper broadband connection so you will only miss the downloads when you're mobile. We all know Kindle Ebooks beat all other ebooks, and Amazon makes the best reading app. It's still an impressive ereader, and the Goodreads integration makes my nerdy soul happy.Cons are it's still a bit heavy for a reader, but a nice case with a strap should remedy that. No back camera, so if this is going to be your main tablet you will be saddened. No HDMI port but those are becoming dinosaur tech, and adapters or Miracast exists now for older tv's. No Google Play store... But I have to say something as a techie dork. Amazon I hope you're listening, you guys almost have it right. What do I mean?You're providing great hardware for discounted prices and adding amazing customer service to your product for no additional cost. *Slow Clap* You're producing Amazon Exclusive content that is available only on your devices, but you allow other devices access to your main features so you're not self isolating either like Apple can.The HDX is truly a step in the right direction of you guys can do the following:Open The Play Store. Trust your products and store, it's great. Apps are discounted, and fair. Limiting yourself in this area is hurting you. I believe you'll see the errors of your ways here. Have exclusive content and offer your own, and win the internet even more than you already have.Step the prices down for the bigger memory tablets. You're not selling machines, you're selling a portal to one of the best services out there. I save so much money using your physical stores alone!! Your videos are beautifully optimized. Your tablets are now impressive, and no one can best your customer service for the services you provide. So, since you're selling physical products, movies, and exclusive content take a bit more of a hit on them HDX tablets so the service is available to more people everywhere.Allow us to customize the carousel. We know it's a Kindle, but give us some options. Let us display a book collection up there instead of all the recently opened things. Remove from carousel is one of my least favorite things. I don't mind the special offers, because there are great deals and recommendations there but allow us some level of customization and I don't mean those weird decals.Let Google into your hearts all the way. Give us a normal page or two with widgets. I love the folders feature.If you made those tweaks your tablet might win the internet completely. (Maybe usb 3.0 too)That all being said this is a great tablet for Prime members, readers, and streamers. The 16 gig HDX is worth keeping around for a long time, and I believe newbies and tech lovers alike will be happy with the hardware.If this is your only tab expect app store limits and some frustrations, but Amazon is really working to improve those things, and HDX owners will reap the benefits of this in the future. Music sounds great for back speakers and is the best I've heard from any non Bluetooth connected tablet yet. Price is still good. May Day is useful for even the savviest of us because it saves time. If you're not going to be a Prime Member, you want the biggest selection of apps and all of their updates immediately and this is going to be your main and only device... you're not a reader... or you're looking for a productivity or Jack of all trades machine this isn't for you. Don't buy it then give it a horrible review. This is a media tab. Movies, music, books, and shopping. All the best things in life. It does do some productivity but if that's what you need look elsewhere.When you pick up an HDX you're picking up well crafted fun. The pixels are so pretty you'll want to shed a tear. Amazon's media access is so extensive you'll want for little, and combined with other services, you may just want for nothing.If you get an HDX no matter what you will find things that will bring you joy, hopefully for a few years to come. I wish I paid full price for device help if it malfunctions (they all do) because dealing with Amazon directly is usually a dream, but I got a great deal. I am absolutely pleasantly surprised and taken with this device, and I think you will be too if this is what you choose for your ereading and Amazon media needs.", "Date": "March 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "Small software glitch found with Skype and Kindle FreeTime.", "Author": "eddiebauer24", "ReviewID": "R3DSY8BNQHPOPK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I would give this a 5 star rating if it wasn't for the problems I have had with getting Skype to work.  So a little background on me, I work internationally and bought three KF HDX 7\" for my three daughters.  One of the main reasons I got them the tablets is so that they can Skype with me while I am out of the country.After an hour of troubleshooting with the tech rep (which was probably the fastest response I have ever gotten from technical support), we were able to get Skype going in the parental section of the tablets.  However the plan for me is that the kids will never be in that section of the tablet.  I have subscribed to the Kindle FreeTime App and this is the only additional app that I have added to this section.Another two hours with another tech rep, and I am still not able to use Skype while in the FreeTime mode.  Currently the problem is being escalated up to another level of tech support.  This very issue is common on all three Kindles that are sitting in front of me.Other than this one issue, I would have to give the tablet a clear 5 star as it is as described by Amazon.  And with tech support like they are offering, the other tablet manufacturers had better watch and learn.Edit:  Got a call from Amazon Customer care and it seem that their engineers are aware that Skype is one of the Apps that conflicts with the settings of the FreeTime environment and as such causes the App to crash.  There is supposed to be a fix being worked on here in the near future and released for wide distribution.  In the mean time I guess I will just keep to skyping on the PC.

I do pay for Amazon Prime membership as well as Kindle Freetime Unlimited for kids.Ok, with that out of the way, allow me to share with you my impressions:Device layout/Handling-----------------------WEIGHT: It feels really light! I measured on my digital scale which showed 10.6oz (300g)VOLUME CONTROL: I actually like the volume up/down on the back where my right fingers can conveniently adjust without losing grip. If these buttons can be re-mapped, then racing games will be at another level with \"paddle shifters!\"POWER BUTTON: I am neutral on its location (left rear). Users can get confused with volume buttons on the other side. Also, once the Origami case is put on, there would not be a need to hit the power button at all since opening/closing cover will do the job automagically.Display/Audio--------------TEXT: very sharp - can see the difference with its improved pixel density. Not sure it'll help improve the reader's vision, but certainly it is very pleasant and easy on the eye. Almost as pleasant as Kindle Paperwhites, but with color!VIDEO: I side-loaded a 1080p movie clip, and it looked real good as it should. Most people will not put big 1080p movies with 16-32GB storage. Downloaded 720p HD videos are fine, but they won't blow anyone away compared to similar tablets on the market.GRAPHICS: very smooth and clean rendering with no lag for fast action games like Real Racing 3 and Asphalt 8. Icons for Apps, movies, and music albums all look sharper. The only negative I found with such high resolution is some older color kids books are image-based, so a full page on older Kindle Fire now look tiny on the HDX display.AUDIO: Very impressive stereo fidelity! I can hear the pleasant difference compare to the Fire HD, but may not be as loud. Sound reflects nicely when laid flat on my kitchen counter.CAMERA: only front-facing camera which looks fine with proper lighting. Nothing breakthrough here. Maybe someday there can be a nigh-vision camera as part of the x-ray feature set...LOLBattery Life--------------STANDBY: full to drained in 4 days - just under 100 hours with email and notification check once a day.ACTIVE USE: I got past 6 hours of web browsing, listen to music, and watching videos before I had to retire (approx 50% juice left)Software/System----------------STABILITY: no hang-and-reboot has occurred so far. This happened a few times on my Fire HD. The pad is warm to touch after a while but not hot.WI-FI/Bluetooth: works well like the Fire HDs.X-Ray: Music lyrics is very cool and I love it. This feature shows up on many of the MP3 albums purchased from Amazon. Usefulness in Kindle books depend on the content. Movies? Works like having an interactive blu-ray session, which I don't find it as useful. As expected, my personal uploaded music are not \"x-rayed\" for lyrics.QUIET TIME: Saw \"Quiet Time\" button next to \"Mayday\" and didn't know what it is, so I pressed \"Mayday\" to find out. Quiet time is to \"mute\" notification and others that cause audibles, but does not mute the sound from music, games, or other apps.MAYDAY: got a male operator within 15 seconds. He did require me to verify my email address, name on the account, and billing address. I asked him how would my kids be able to use this feature when I issue them the new Kindle HDX?  He said \"good question\" and will pass it on...So just a heads-up that the operator will need certain info.SILK: Browser runs fast as is. This is NOT always the case with Fire HD, where the browser can crawl like a turtle unless the \"Accelerate Page Loading\" is turned off. So looks like the developers fixed this to perform as advertised. I hope that will give Fire HD's software an update also.Summary--------For Kindle users: The HDX is a good incremental upgrade to Fire HD. The major improvements underneath don't surface as much for general users. But for owners of the first generation Kindle Fire, upgrade to HDX is significant.For non Kindle tablet owners: Kindle devices greatly enhance experience with Amazon's offerings with e-books, music hosting, instant videos, magazines, and especially for Prime members.

Wertz \"Imautobot\"", "ReviewID": "R1EQCALRS6SF8F", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I really really wanted to like this Kindle.  I bought it as a upgrade from a 2012 Google Nexus 7.  This was a mistake.At first I did this because I am a Prime member, and an Amazon device is really the only way to get access to the streaming video on a tablet, or the lending library option.  However, these additional options do not make up for what I lost.  By this I mean, I can't (easily) get any Google apps installed on the device.  If you want a legitimate version of any Google product, or many other Google play apps, you cannot install it without a side-load situation.  My problem with that is that apks are then downloaded by non-store sites, this means they might be out of date, or even hacked.  I chose the path of least resistance and just sent it back.  I've got better things to do with my time that hack a product right out of the box.  While this means you don't get access to the actual G-mail app, Google Earth, Google+, and YouTube, the loss that hurt me the most was the inability to install Chrome.  Chrome has all my bookmarks, and I had little desire to painstakingly re-enter all those into the silk browser.The hardware is nice, the interface runs smooth, and the high res icons that consume the better part of the main menu are surprisingly beautiful.  However, I found it annoying that under those icons, you'll be force fed amazon purchase suggestions based upon on what icon is centered.  I bought the Kindle without the \"special offers\" for a reason, so this subtle solicitation bothered me.Ultimately the Kindle feels only slightly less locked down than an iPhone/iPad, which is exactly the same reason why I don't buy those Apple products.  I want my device to be free to get apps from multiple (legitimate) sources.  And I want that functionality to exist out of the box.  It's interesting that my Nexus 7 can easily get the Amazon app store installed, but the Kindle could not easily have given me access to the Google Play store.I ended up replacing this with a Nexus 7 2013, which lamentably has a slightly slower processor, but at least I'm not in for any of these proprietary surprises.  Maybe I've just been spoiled by my other Android devices.If Kindle allows Google apps to be able to be installed through a front-door option, I would gladly revisit the Kindle hardware, it is still a nice piece of equipment.", "Date": "November 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "No regrets", "Author": "BW", "ReviewID": "R3RNX9T9Q4CDCO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently upgraded to the HDX from the HD.

Overall I'm very pleased with the device.  Here are the best things about it (in my opinion):1)  Noticeably faster than my old tablet2)  Flatter/lighter/easier to hold for long periods of time3) Better placement of power button and headphone jack4) Manual on-exterior-of-device volume control (instead of having to go through settings, etc.)5)  Email is better in every conceivable way!6) Much more storage7) better sound8) less clunky OS than the original Fire9) easy to switch quickly from one app to anotherHonestly, the only reason I'm not giving the device 5 stars is because I don't like the blue LED bleed around the edges (sometimes referred to as the \"blue haze\" by other reviewers) when viewing something with a light background.  I read on my device a lot and it is very noticeable (and I feel quite distracting) in both the black-on-white and brown-on-sepia settings.  On my device the bleed is noticeable all the way around and is wider on the long sides (measures about 1/4 of an inch) but thinner (about 1/8 of an inch) on the short sides.  I used the Mayday button (which is a really nifty feature, by the way) and was told that this was normal and that there was nothing I could do about it.  I find this pretty disappointing, but it isn't a deal-breaker for me - I'm not going to reject it and return it for a refund due to the blue haze issue (though if they manage to come up with some sort of update that would fix/improve it, I'd be the first to get that update!).That said, I'd still recommend this tablet to people - particularly if they use it more for non-reading activities.

I am well pleased with the new device. The graphics are amazing whether watching Prime or You Tube videos as well as viewing web sites or playing games. The new processor is extremely snappy and executes loading and running apps very fast. I have no issue with the blue haze issue on the edge of the display. I understand the reasons for the blue LED use and accept Amazons explanation. It is a non issue, really. I read quite a bit on the Kindle HDX on a plain white screen then a sepia screen and was not distracted. Again, it is on the very edges where no text appears. It is nonexistent on videos, dark backgrounds, etc. I did try the Mayday function with a question and it was promptly answered and frankly, this is a really progressive implementation of customer service/tech support. Very nice job Amazon. The curated appstore is obviously not as complete as Google Play but has anything important and then some. I do not feel the need to sideload apps whatsoever. The essentials are more than covered and then some. For the record I also own the Google Nexus 7 2nd Gen and think these are two great devices. I'm fully invested in the Amazon ecosystem with books, MP3's, apps and videos and like having a dedicated device. The Nexus 7 can do all the same things by running Amazon Apps except there is no App for Amazon Instant Video. The IOS (ipad, iphone) has such an app, but not android. All told I have the best of both worlds and didn't break the bank to do so. If you are on the fence I don't think you can lose either way. The biggest differences are No Google Play on the Fire HDX, and no Amazon Instant Video on the Nexus 7. Faster quad core processor on the Fire HDX and brighter screen on the Nexus 7. There is a sense of community with Amazon that is really an intangible and keeps me loyal to this company. Not to mention the great shopping experience with Prime, although this has nothing to do with the tablet. You'll like the Kindle Fire HDX. It is a fast and responsive device.After using the Fire HDX for a week I am discovering that there is a compatibility issue with certain apps that I used on my Kindle Fire HD but will not run on the Fire HDX. Two apps in particular, Tune in Radio and Optimum TV app cannot run on the HDX. I am awaiting an update of the app or the HDX to remedy this. Hopefully this is a temporary situation.

I have until the 22nd of November to return it for a refund, and if nothing goes wrong I won't be coming back to subtract stars.  The reason for my weariness is because I had to send the first on back due to issues and here they are:  1st everyone else and their Grandma was complaining about the blue or purple haze around the edge of the white page when you're reading.  I noticed that on mine as well but honestly it's not that noticeable and not distracting at least to me.  There are varying opinions even among the techs at amazon I spoke with as to whether this is intended or a flaw.  2nd while I was reading, the page would blank out for a second or two once in a long while.  That I didn't like.  3d Another issue was the fact that certain parts of my screen where sluggish to respond to touch.  That tore it and I had to exchange it.  I spoke with tech support through the mayday function, but all I got was a picture and no video like they said.There was an update that would not download, and I had the device for 2 days.  All that time the update bar never moved.One thing that surprised me was the cheap packaging the first kindle arrived in.  It came in a cushioned mailing envelope and the kindle was sliding around inside.  I thought that was kind of a cheesy way to ship a $300.00 device, and I was happy to see that yesterday when my new one arrived it came in a very well cushioned sturdy box which I appreciated a lot more than the cheesy cushioned envelope the first one came in.  I wouldn't be surprised if some of the issues I was having were due to the kindle being banged around by ups personnel playing football with it.  As usual Amazon was very cooperative and they rushed me another one in a couple of days.  I received the new one yesterday, and I still see the blue haze around the page, but like I said that doesn't bother me.  I usually read with the black backdrop and white letters in any case.  Everything else on this one is running smoothly so far, but it's on probation.  I'm giving it 5 stars because so far everything on it works like it's supposed to.  I used the mayday function on it a couple of times and it only took a few seconds for a live video of the tech to pop up on my screen which I found pretty cool and very helpful.  So far I find it to be a 5 star device, but like I said, I'm going to give it a month and see if I have to come back and change my review or not.  I'm hoping not because I really like it, and hope it stays like it is.  The high definition is amazing, and so far the only thing I haven't tried is the Skype function due to the fact that I don't feel like blowing more money on something I really don't need because you have to purchase time with them like you would with a cell phone company.  Something to consider maybe in the future.  I opted for the one with the ads but they don't bother me in the least, and you only see them when you are turning your device on.  I also have the one with the 64 gbs which is a definite improvement over my first generation kindle which this one is replacing.Overall I think it's a great device, and I've checked out ipads, and I'm glad I've got this instead of one of the overpriced super hyped ipads.  You're on probation kindle HDX until the 22nd of November!  Ok, here it is November 7th, and I've had my new kindle now for a while and I just thought I'd come back and add something I don't like about it.  I thought of subtracting a star because of these two reasons, but the good outweigh the bad (at least in my opinion) and here are the two reasons why I almost subtracted a star:First there is no light indicating when your kindle is fully charged.  You have to turn your kindle on to see if it's finished charging.  Why get rid of the light indicator?  Did it really take up that much space?Second: Why are the speakers in the back and not in the front?  It sounds a hell of a lot better when you turn your kindle backwards and listen to it.  Then you can't see the video.  Come on Amazon!  You've made a killer device and it could have been a lot better by adding a charge indicator light and moving the speakers to where they should be!

I got it on special for $154 and at that price it's a freaking bargain.  I am a  longtime Ipad user (Ipad 2 and more recently Ipad Air) but I was looking for something more portable I could take on my subway ride to work and I didn't want to drop $400 for an Ipad Mini.  What really sold me on the HDX was that I could download free content from Prime and then watch that on the train and I would be able to use the device as a very portable reader.  I was expecting a significant downgrade from my Ipad Air in performance but have found myself blown away by:1. Feel:  The device is light, well built and has good tactile feel with a grippy, rubber like backing.  I bought a case (10 bucks) which was fine but I really liked holding the device without protection so I ditched it.2. Picture:  The picture quality for videos is amazing, far surpassing the Ipad Air's (or any other display I've seen):  I downloaded and watched (for free) an episode of Justified and was noticing slight blemishes and beads of sweat on people's faces.  The images are simply beautiful.3.  Performance:  The HDX is snappy with no lag whatsoever and very intuitive functionality. I was even able to side load a nook app and other Google Play apps in a matter of minutes following easy instructions on line.4.  Browser:  Silk is very quick and easy to use and works like Chrome (which can also be sideloaded but I prefer Silk)5. Customer Support: The Mayday function is revolutionary.  I have never waited more than 30 seconds for help and every rep has been friendly and competent (and native English speakers).  They have walked me through the necessary steps, drawing and highlighting on my unit, and even provided additional tips and suggestions.  Like others I had some issues with dropped WI-FI signals but the Mayday rep downloaded a WI-FI manager for me that maximizes the signal strength from my router and I haven't had a dropped signal since then, about a week ago.  One Mayday rep I spoke to said they spend a lot of time helping folks with basic non-HDX-specific functions on third party apps like Facebook or email like posting pictures or attaching documents.  The Mayday reps are also Amazon generalists and can handle customer service issues as well.6. Cloud storage: This was something I wasn't even aware of when I purchased the unit but copying photos from my Mac and music from Itunes into the Amazon cloud and onto the device was easy and free (2GB for photos and 250 songs).  I also have all my Nook books on the unit which I didn't know was something I could do.In summary I am very impressed with my HDX.  It's a very capable, inexpensive little device.  It won't replace my Ipad use at home but it's perfect for commuting and travelling places where I don't want to carry a larger device.  I have since purchased one for my mom for Mother's Day.  I originally purchased the Fire for her but the Mayday button would be so helpful for her, particularly with everyday functions like how to use Facebook, that I returned the Fire and upgraded to HDX.In brief response to comments from some of the the other reviewers: it is true that the universe of available apps is smaller than on Google Play or Itunes.  That's not really Amazon's fault and most Google Play apps can be side loaded with third-party software. The critical apps are all there.  Also, as other reviewers have noted, the HDX can drop WI-FI signals.  As discussed above, Amazon is aware of the issue and, according to the Mayday rep I spoke with, is working on a fix to be released with the next software update.  In the meantime, the third-party WiFi manager the rep downloaded onto my unit has worked perfectly.", "Date": "May 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Dissapointing technical support", "Author": "Larry Sassaman", "ReviewID": "R2I5UIE6Y91PM2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased the HDX in early Dec. 2013 and until last week was very pleased with the Kindle's performance.

As a device for browsing the web, viewing movies and, most especially, reading, it is the best device I've ever tried. It is not without its failings when compared to other tablets (or even the iPhone), but overall I like it. The review that follows is more of a semi-organized narrative vs a table of pros/cons or an organized feature list with scores.Rotation (for apps that support it) is really fast and seamless. The place where rotation doesn't do what I'd expect is email; more on that below.The response time when turned on is what you'd expect. It would be nice if it was easier to stop other apps from running; even iOS 6 has a straightforward way for this (much better in iOS 7). Amazon stuck with the slow & clunky Settings/Apps/Running method that has been in Android seemingly forever. Some apps get pretty unhappy with you if you force them to stop. You can reboot for a clean start, but that makes start-up pretty slow. A pity that while keeping this Android feature they disabled some other key features (see below for Apps issue).Books and even newspapers display their text and pictures beautifully. The paging is snappy unlike my older 2nd Gen Kindle, and for speech-enabled books, the speech synthesis system is decent. I LOVE the X-Ray feature. It is not perfect, but I assume it will just keep getting better.Silk is a decent web browser, but not as smooth as its name tries to imply. It is fast, but doesn't work with some important websites; and when it doesn't work it really doesn't work. Take Google Maps for instance. The display of Google Maps just plain sucks. No doubt about it. My iPhone handles Google Maps much better (and has a Google Maps app). No, I don't plan to take my Kindle on the road as a map device, but I would like to use it instead of my iPhone when a computer isn't handy; but that is not to be. To make things worse, there is no Google Maps app in Amazon's store. And to add insult to injury, you cannot install apps from Google Play unless you root your Kindle. That just plain sucks. This takes thousands of Android apps and puts them out of your reach. Amazon already has a \"don't install from other app stores\" switch there. When I turn that off, the Kindle HDX should just work with Google Play... I do not understand why Amazon made this choice and the Kindle HDX is poorer for it.I don't have many apps installed (some that I want to install I cannot -- see note above about Google Play). Some that I did install are ill-suited to my Kindle (e.g. Audubon Birds) as they have a fixed orientation and don't understand rotation. I'll probably stick to books and movies (and newspapers), which no doubt suits Amazon just fine.On the question of e-mail: the Kindle's email support looks pretty, but is pretty non-functional for me. I have an Exchange account plus some iMAP-only accounts that I setup. The Exchange account works really well, except for the Kindle's UI (see below) and some odd configuration things. For instance, no matter how many times I changed my notification sound, the HDX insisted on playing a different one. I even tried using the MAYDAY feature to see if the support gurus could help. I got my HDX on the first day they were available, so the support gurus will still learning the device and did not offer up anything I did not know. In the end I turned off notification and rely on my iPhone to alert me.The mail UI is disappointing in that when I rotate my HDX to landscape mode to gain reading space, the HDX instead insists on showing an Outlook-like 2 pane UI. I thought there was no way to change this, until another user (thanks, Judy) pointed out that a 3-dot menu shows up when a message is selected. That menu allows you to switch to fullscreen mode while viewing the message.WORST THING OF ALL with email: The HDX would randomly mark some unviewed messages as read. This took me many, many days to figure out, and caused me to miss some time-critical messages. How do I know it's the HDX? It started after I setup my iMAP accounts on the HDX; it stopped when I deleted them (another ding vs. other devices I've used: no way to disable the account just for testing -- you must delete it or use it).It is nice that installing my Exchange mailbox brought over my contacts & calendar, though I really don't need yet another device chiming to remind me of meetings. So I use this more as a quick check when reading so I don't need to get my iPhone out.The virtual keyboard is ok, but only just ok. It isn't smart about things like automatically engaging the shift key after punctuation or on a new line (I thought I disliked that about the iPhone at times, but the HDX made me realize how handy it is -- sad that my year-old iPhone has a better typing UI than my new HDX though). The spacing makes it easier to type on than a phone, but I miss the iPhone's features (perhaps just because I've become used to them). I do like the running display of word choices that show up as I type.A general configuration gripe: why is there only 1 sound type to be configured? There are notifications for: email, apps, calendar... why just one sound? And why don't changes to that take hold? Sigh, yes it is a smaller detail but one that impacts the \"fit and finish\" of the device. It's not like Amazon hasn't shipped out a tablet-ish device before, so this disappointed me.Movies -- now this is a REALLY nice feature. The speakers on the HDX (especially with the origami cover in place -- separate review coming on that) are just ok; I'd plug a nice headset in to listen. It is very cool that you can download prime movies onto the device and go on the road with those. What I do not understand is why the HDX has no way to SEARCH for downloadable prime movies. Instead, you need to browse, movie-by-movie, to find the ones that can be downloaded. C'mon, Amazon... really?? I haven't watched a movie on my HDX yet but will on a future road trip. I just hope the battery holds up.The UI for viewing photos is marginal; there is no good way to search for, sort or group photos. You just need to scroll through them and try to spot what you want. Worse, when you copy pictures across the USB interface (yay for a USB interface -- with the display, the only other technical advantage the HDX has), the picture's creation date is tossed. The HDX sets the creation date to the date the picture was copied; I can see NO advantage to anybody except for the careless programmer who didn't have to add that feature to his or her spec. Once you find the picture you want though, the display is what you'd expect from the HDX. Again, if I really want to find a particular picture quickly, I guess I'll just go to my iPhone. I am not even sure I'll keep moving pictures to my Kindle.Music: don't use it. My iPhone syncs with iTunes and I also have an iPod. Moving all of that to Amazon's cloud or my HDX would require conversion from Apple's format. Just not worth the time. Some of my music was purchased from Amazon, and those songs are available. But it is a small subset. Top it off with marginal speakers in my configuration and, well I just don't use it.I am yet to try Skype, but I suspect it would work very well.The HDX comes connected to Amazon's store. That makes it easy to buy books or movies. If I ever remember to carry my HDX into my basement to watch movies, it could be an easy way to select a For Rent movie when I want to watch it through my XBox. Too bad the swipe-to-TV feature doesn't include using the Amazon XBox app... then I'd always take my HDX downstairs with me!That leads to another oddity: for some Kindle management features you have to leave Amazon's store app and use Silk (or your laptop or iPhone) to go onto the web. Why is that? I can buy stuff from Amazon (including expensive, physical merchandise), but if I want to add an email address to my \"approved for documents\" list I need to go sign-on via Silk and browse around their website to find that feature? Doesn't make sense to me.Now the Mayday feature -- it is a really nice idea. I am fairly technical, and when I ask for help it is usually on some detail (like why won't my changes to the Notification sound stick?) that is not easy to find in the documentation. Unhappily for me, the Mayday reps, while very eager to help, did not yet know the HDX very well and I was often put on hold while they went to research things. So I'd go back to reading something and sliding their little window around on my HDX... which got old pretty fast. It is, though, really nice to have that help available when they are able to help. I can hardly wait to try hitting Mayday on Xmas day just to see if they can handle the load ;-)So why did I give this device 4 stars? Because it replaced my older, 2nd gen Kindle and as I said above, it rocks in that role. If you want to view this as an iPad competitor, I think it fails as a general-purpose device that you'd take on the road instead of a laptop; hell my iPhone does a better job of that than this new HDX. But that isn't why I bought it.

The Ipad has a good track record but I was looking for a small productive powerhouse tablet under $300. It is being debated weather the Apple A7 in the new Ipad mini is faster then the Snapdragon 800 + Adreno 330. The price range of the new Ipad mini was a tad to high for me.The Nexus 7 2013 is the Hdx's adversary. Most of the spec's are similar like the screen and battery life. The deal breaker for me was the Hdx had a better processor chipset and build quality. I had the 1st gen Nexus 7 before and loved the power for the price but the Nexus had a defect after a couple of weeks and had broken parts rattle inside the tablet. Later on the screen became unresponsive. I was able to return it for a full refund. I heard from many people that the build quality of Amazon's Fire tablets were good. And so I was swayed.Here is a list of pro and con's the Hdx 7\" has:Pro's:-Fastest tablet on the market (Snapdragon 800 + Adreno 330) (exception. the debated Apple A7 chip)!-High Def screen with high ppi-Acceptable battery life-Excellent build quality!-Simple user interface-Good customer support with Mayday-Aggressive and competitive price point!-I almost forgot, THE SPEAKERS ARE AMAZING I never heard speakers on a tablet / laptop / phone this good! Amazing, no doubt.Con's:-Amazon's app store is lacking supporters*-Bulky user interface for some, including me**-No Google support-Screen blue haze (not a very large issue)****There is a way to install android app's other then Amazon's App store. By downloading android .apk's with a usb or by downloading it from the web browser then using the file manager to install them. Most apps work, some do not.**I am not a fan of the user interface. It is simple and it works but has little room for customization. As soon as a root and rom comes out, I'm going for it! Then I'll be able to give this review 5 stars!***People report blue haze around the border of the screen, my screen has so little haze it's not noticeable unless I have a white background and the brightness high. This is not a true con since it does not affect me. If it affects you, Amazon is willing to work it out with there excellent costumer service.If your looking for a tablet this holiday session, look no more! This is a top tier Tablet and I believe the HDX line of tablets sets its place well in the top 3 tablets for 2013! If your looking for build quality, ultra fast gaming and productivity/multitasking response, all at a great price, you found an award winning device!Until a root and rom comes out, I'll give this baby a solid 4 starsYou wont regret buying this tablet.", "Date": "October 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing Kindle", "Author": "Donna Isbell", "ReviewID": "R1WQR173L4SGSR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a rare eye diease .

Read this before you buy!", "Author": "J. Andrew Geary", "ReviewID": "RFJ1CNSGGVYJ1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First, the good:The screen was amazing! I  started watching a nature documentary and was transfixed. Movies, tv shows, games, everything looked great on this device.The device was lightweight, had a fast processor and decent memory. I bought the 64GB but they should have made a 128GB since a single 1080p movie with dolby surround took up 9.5-10.3GB when downloaded from my amazon account. You only get 54 GB to start with because of the operating system and whatever else they put on.I could download Prime TV shows to watch offline when travelling, a great feature! The website said you could download Prime movies as well, but I could not find any that gave me the download option.The device came with a charging block (unlike the fire hd I bought last year).It was for these reasons I gave the unit 2 starts and not just 1. Keep reading to find out why!Second, the not so good:When you plug in the charging cord and the headphone, they are not flat and parallel with the unit. They stick up at about a 15 degree angle. Not a big deal, but it made me nervous in case someone accidentally set something on top of it while it was on the counter or desk. I think the damage would be catastrophic to the unit if that happened.The battery life is not great. This unit sucks down the battery faster than my fire hd does.Lastly, the terrible:I received the unit and spent the day loading it with videos and goodies for an upcoming trip. The last thing I did was sit down to watch a movie I bought specifically to watch on this unit's screen. I noticed a static buzz underneath the soundtrack that was annoying. I experimented until I found that the buzz was happening everytime the unit accessed the internet. Since the movie in question was streaming, the buzz was constant. I tried a downloaded movie, no buzz. I tried surfing the web with nothing on and everytime I clicked a new link, the buzz would be there until the new page was done loading. So, I called Amazon and they sent out a new unit (recieved the next day, thank you Amazon!).The new unit did the same thing. I tried some more experiments and found the buzzing happened with all my ear buds (cheap ones and expensive ones) and did NOT happen with my headphones (both cheap and expensive were clear sounding). The rest of the unit was so cool, I figured I could work around this even though the only reason I have expensive ear buds is to travel with my fire hd. So, I spent another day dowloading tv shows and other goodies to prepare for my trip. I was sitting reading a book and downloading a movie when the unit flashed a warning that I had used up 90% of the storage and did I want to delete something. I clicked no and the unit shut off. I knew the battery was a little low so I plugged in the unit for 20-30 minutes. I tried restarting the unit and nothing. I held down the on/off button for 20 seconds like the website said to and got a brief \"Kindle Fire\" screen flash but nothing else. I called tech support and we basically tried the same thing again and the tech said that they could replace the unit, again.So, I am sending this unit back and getting a refund. I've wasted 2 whole days dealing with this. I have 2 different covers on their way because the origami cover was terrible (see my review for the cover for that story) and I still have to deal with returning those.I'm very annoyed with this whole process because I feel like this was a great product that got rushed through testing and production and was just not ready for consumers yet. I Ioved my original kindle fire and still love my fire hd. Making the screen better with more memory was all I could ask for to make it a perfect product (for what I needed it for) and was really excited about the hdx.

When I received the device it was at 63%. After 3 hours on the charger it was at 63%. I tried the HDX charger on my Fire HD and it charged without a problem. I called Amazon and did all the usual resets and reboots and the battery issue still remains. I then tried my old charger (which is actually more powerful) and after 7 hours I got it up to 78%. I left the charger on over night and it only reached 80%. I would be curious to know if anyone else is having issues with the battery. Amazon will be sending a replacement.Also as noted by another customer, there is a purple haze around the edge of the reading page when trying to read a book.UPDATE: Well, I received my replacement Fire HDX and the good news is that the battery issue is no longer an issue BUT the blue light bleed is even worse than the first one! Since I use the device the most for reading - this is just not acceptable. Back it goes. I am very disappointed that Amazon would release a device that is or was primarily geared toward readers...and have it be unreadable.UPDATE: Going to try this again. I ordered the Kindle Fire HDX with the 3G & WiFi...and I ordered the Kindle Paperwhite to cover my bases. There were a lot of pluses with the new Fire but the blue/purge light bleed was just something I couldn't handle. I hope this one isn't as noticeable but if it is...I will use the Paperwhite for reading. I was going to order the iPad mini with Retina display - but even with buying the Paperwhite - the Fire HDX was still at least 30% less!!

With the Invellop cover/case you can't go wrong, (it will turn the HDX on and off by opening and closing the case and fits on the HDX better than the HD version did).  I do notice the blue light on the edges of white pages, but its totally not an issue at all.  I love the smaller size, yet same size screen.  With the case you really notice the difference between the HD and the HDX in its case, weight and size-wise. Also I really like the Mayday feature;  within seconds I was talking to a live human who's fave popped up in a small Window on my screen.  Very cool! !!!I only have two gripes:1)  No microSD card slot.  Still!!! That's a bummer.  PRetty big bummer, but I guess Amazon wants you to store everything in their cloud, or something.  I have the 32gb version and it's barely enough for me, personally.  There's only something like 24gb (or is it 29gb?) left after the OS, and my music alone takes up 20gb.2)  No rear camera!!  Still!!!3)  If you're not going to give us a real camera, I can kind of live with that - though it would be fun to have - but you could at least make the camera on there be sensitive to the fact that you'll be using it for some sort of face-to-face interaction, and we don't like having our nose look huge and our arms aren't long enough to hold the thing far enough away so it doesn't distort our features.  All in all, the camera is pretty much completely useless.CONCLUSION:  Is it worth the upgrade cost?  I, personally, think so.

I am now switching over to google's marketplace because i do not want to have to use a kindle.  Here are some of the reasons why I sent it back.1. Kindle Fire HDX is not able to access all websites.  I was on the phone with customer service trying to resolve the issue and this is what they told me.  I was trying to access 'stocktwits.com' and my kindle could not navigate there.  Apparently this is the case with various sites.  I frequent stocktwits regularly, so this was a big deal for me.2.  Since kindle does not support adobe flash, you have to switch between \"desktop\" and \"mobile\" mode to get videos to play on various websites.  No rhyme or reason to this, but an annoying step to have to take.  This again is customer services solution to videos that wouldn't load on certain sites.3.  The screen is not customizable.  This doesn't sound like a big deal at first, but you'd be surprised at how annoying seeing advertisements each time you unlock your screen can be.  Customer service informed me there is no work around for this.4.  Kindles apps are not well supported.  I tried downloading the etrade app, and it didn't work.  the app would download, but it wouldn't work.  Etrade customer service informed me that they haven't fully developed the app for fire HDX's yet.  Not high on their list of priorities I guess.  I'm sure this is the same with many other apps.  I also could not download the stocktwits app.5.  There is a blue haze.  I know this is much talked about, but it is there.  It didn't really annoy me very much though.6.  Amazon uses the kindle to advertise to you like crazy.  My facebook feed had amazon ads at the top of my page.  my google email immediately became swarmed with amazon emails.  they suggest apps and items under the carousel.  they advertise each time you unlock the tablet.  i mean enough is enough!7.  I'm not impressed with the ease of navigating the device.  I think android is much more intuitive and user friendly, not to mention you have much more versatility since android is open source.Are there Pro's?  sure, but not enough to outweigh the cons for me personally.  It is a relatively snappy device.  The cost is low as well.  I think there are child protective functions if you have kids.If you are need to save money financially by going with the Kindle instead of a more expensive Android or Ipad (don't know much about Ipads), then a kindle may be for you.  But I was buying this strictly for access to amazon instant video, not so much because of price, and I was disappointed.  I really tried to make myself like it, since I love amazon as a company, but I am returning it and switching to Google movies.

When the HDX model came out late last year, I was interested in some of the features particularly the stated improved screen, not that there were complaints about its predecessor's readability! When amazon offered the HDX on an  incentive payment plan, I couldn't resist so clicked the purchase. It arrived a day earlier than advertised, an auspicious beginning, and was packed in recyclable cardboard which pleased this Tree Hugger greatly. The minimalist box for the device was likewise showing consideration for the environment which still affording a design tour d' force. a simple decorative sleeve houses the box in which the Kindle nestles along with the power cord and adapter, plus a small, plain set up sheet for the beginner.This edition of the Kindle Fire is noticeably thinner. I did have some difficulty plugging the cord into it as it goes in at an angle, whereas the other model was a straight shot. Finding the power button, changed from the bottom next to the charging cord to the back of the device, was likewise confounding briefly but other than that, I'd have to say... it was all a piece of cake, and of course the amazon cloud had already registered this newest Kindle along with preparing to download all the eBooks etc. Couldn't be much easier than that.In the case of the Kindle Fire HDX, I'd have to say, it is truly a refined device in all regards and justifies the purchase. I strongly recommend getting one of the Kindle eBooks on the Fire HDX to speed up the use of your new device. I found it enormously beneficial in both cases, throughout time. I am currently using the Kindle Fire HDX & HD Complete Guidebook published March, 2014.As a further satisfied purchaser of the device, may I state that while I am a bonafide Apple User, I still prefer the Kindle Fire (HDX) for eBooks and definitely for the value that amazon provides in pricing them.", "Date": "April 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Faster, brighter, lighter, better!", "Author": "Brad Shea", "ReviewID": "RF92BO14OA20C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have FIVE Kindle Fires in this house.

The ability to download & store on the Kindle was new for HDX for Prime users, and you can't do that on the HD.But, after opening the HDX to use, we discovered it does NOT have an HDMI port to connect to the TV with an HDMI cable, like the previous Kindle Fire HD. I cannot believe Amazon removed the HDMI port for the HDX! Makes no sense, and apparently other customers were caught off-guard, too. If you read the description very closely, you'll find that info, but I don't think any HD user expected them to REMOVE a great feature like that.The only way to display HDX content on your TV is to have a TV already set up for Miracast or buy a wireless Miracast adapter (like the crappy Netgear one). In spite of being able to download movies with the HDX rather than live-stream, we still have to use this added wireless device anyway, and had to pay a good bit for it, on top of the HDX price. So, we still get some buffering glitches with this, and the quality is not very good (pixilation), even when we download the movie at the highest quality available. I can't be sure if the problems are from the HDX or the Netgear Miracast adapter, but the end result is we're not using the capability for which I bought the darn thing.Overall, the Kindle Fire HDX and the added Miracast wireless device are a disappointment. Definitely prefer our old Kindle Fire HD with the HDMI cable, even though we have to stream live with it. We're still doing that to watch movies instead of using the download-to-HDX option. IF the HDX with the Miracast adapter worked well (no glitches/hiccups, no pixilation), it would probably be worth it in spite of the additional costs because you wouldn't have to be tethered to the TV with the HDMI cable. That was never really a problem, but it's the only advantage I can see with the HDX. But you do still have to have that added device connected to your TV, with its cables & power supply.I almost returned the HDX when discovered the HDMI problem, but decided to get the Miracast device and try it out. In spite of the disappointment & the fact that we cannot use this at all as intended, we kept the HDX just to have an additional tablet to toss in a backpack or purse. I got it on sale right before Xmas, and it's sort of handy to have 2 (can use one while other is charging), but overall, there's no real benefit over the HD for us, and the HD was a better deal.By the way, I contacted Amazon about the HDX and Miracast devices before I bought an adapter, was transferred to their \"Kindle Fire HDX experts in technical service\" (apparently in India) and got no where. They couldn't tell me anything about which Miracast adapters are available, which ones work, etc. They basically read from the Web description that the HDX uses Miracast. That's it.

I read about 100 books a year on my kindle and it hasn't bothered me one bit nor hurt my eyes or made me need to quit reading at times. And honestly, I have sensitive eyes - I wear sunglasses even on cloudy days. So don't let this blue haze thing faze you when deciding if the Kindle Fire HDX is for you or not.As for the other features, awesome. I've had every generation of kindle and this is definitely my favorite. Clear picture, quality sound.

I'm not sure if this is because my Galaxy S4 is just enough (in terms of size) for me to do most of the things I need to do or if it is because a couple things about the HDX Fire that annoy me and thus got me to use it less.First, the charger it comes with is just too slow.  I realize the original charger is a 'slow' version and a 'fast' charger is sold separately, but the slow should not be a snail crawl charger.  Also, the Kindle crashed on me.  I called customer care, they helped me quickly reset the device to factory settings and it seemed to have fixed it.  I am concerned I have a defect though.  Regardless, they say I have a warranty and can get it replaced anytime within a year (I hope this stands true).  I'm always gun shy to exchange things quickly because OEMs tend to send you a refurb for your new device.These two items make the device a neutral buy rating for me.

I decided to go with this because it was on sale and the hardware specs are amazing. I've only had a day to play around with it but the power of the tablet is amazing. It comes with a 2.2GHz quad-core processor, which is the standard in the latest tablets. As a big Hulu Plus, and Netflix fan watching movies, clips, and TV shows are amazing on the (1920x1200), high pixel density (323 PPI) screen.** Also please remember, although you do not have access to a lot of Googles applications like:  Google Play, Maps, Gmail, YouTube, and Instagram.

I do not think there have been any disappointments with this tablet, but I am finding out daily how truly amazing this thing is.  I believe the most important asset for me is how all the books I bought between my Kindle keyboard and HD Fire, automatically loaded on my HDX, and they were already placled in collections.  I was dissapointed with the Kindle collections app by M. Gallagher because it was painstaking for me to try to categorize all my books (approx. 1,300+), and after getting a little over 200, the Collections app. crashed and had to start from scratch!  Now, I do not have to worry, because I have no backlog and can find my books quickly.I have my Direct TV app on the HDX and I watch TV right from my tablet.  I am legally blind, so this is important to me.  I love TCM Classic Movies, and since many times the words are dubbed, I do not have to jump up and sit right in front of the TV set to read the lines.  Text to speech is improved, and I can go on and on.  The price is amazingly low for what this tablet can do and I have barely scratached the surface.  I understand that I can get a braille keyboard and even more features for those of us who are optically impaired.  The HDX is the fourth (4th) Kindle I have had--2 Keyboards (l was a gift to my sister) 1 Kindle Fire HD, and 1 Kindle HDX.

The rubbery frame is easy to hold, and doesn't feel cheap. The viewing area (reportedly Gorilla glass) is generous and fairly smudge free.Integration with Google apps like gmail, calendar, etc is very easy. My inbox, contacts, and entire calendar were up and running in just a few minutes.Tunes sound good, whether it be from my own collection in the Amazon cloud, via Pandora, or on YouTube. Placing the Kindle face up on a hard surface optimizes tone and volume.Most website functionality is comparable to a PC, but there are the occasional pages that look funny. As an example, I use my Kindle as an auxiliary while playing Battlefield 4, and while it's usually easy to manipulate, there are times when screen resolution makes buttons/web parts awkward.As far as books, I only have a few so far. Some seem better adapted to the Kindle format than others; The Oatmeal's \"How to Tell if Your Cat is Plotting to Kill You\" is flawless, but Sun Tzu's \"Art of War\" has the occasional odd hard-return.Although the auto-brightness feature is a nice touch, but I've found that it sometimes it will \"adjust\" for no reason. Still not enough to drop it down from 5 stars.I can't comment on Facebook or Twitter functionality as I use neither of those, but the StumbleUpon app is fun.If my Kindle HDX gets broken, for whatever reason, I would buy another without hesitation.

She is a writer and she reads books as fast as I can watch a couple of movies.  What a perfect gift I thought this would be.

I'm a guy and what I like I figure she would like - right?  So I bought it.  So as to be sure she realized the kindle is now something real and useful in so many other ways, I first prepared the Kindle introduction video. Kimble has a great video explaining all the benefits that it does.I prepared the TV which we have hooked up to a computer to first show her the video before opening the box to see what it is.  I figured once she saw all the cool stuff it does she would defiantly have a change of heart by loving it and wanting it.She saw the video, opened it up and began learning it all.  Kindle has a REALLY good feature.  Tap one button and a live person comes on screen to guide you through anything at all.  They can even do it for you by drawing circles around what they click and do so you can see and learn - really making it easy.My wife learned enough very fast as to contact this live tech person on Christmas day.And, she asked him for help.  Within no time at all he, according to her directions took no time at all to coordinate the return of the Kimble, even with a return label to print out.Well - That's how my Christmas went.(guys skip this part and don't read) To all of the ladies reading this:  I respect your thoughts, wants and needs.(woman skip this part and don't read) To all the guys reading this:  You can't win so buy her a vacuum cleaner it couldn't be worse than anything else you do>", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "A minor tradeoff between Amazon Prime benefits and Google Play access...", "Author": "R.

Google's uploader can be set up to automatically scan my music folders and refresh my library with any new content, and Amazon's uploader does not do that.While Google does offer a web version of their music player - which works fine in the Silk browser - it doesn't have as many features as their native app.Other than that, I've been quite happy so far.

Admittedly I was initially disappointed with the purplish edge.My advice if your HDX has that issue is to use your HDX for a few days.I now only notice it if i'm looking for it.* Everything is faster on the HDX.The internet is blazing fast on the HDX.Mine holds the connection well at home and at free wifi locations.* Navigation is much improved.On previous models you sometimes had to tap multiple times to get the screen to respond. Also typing was wonky.Most of the navigation worries seem to be a thing of the past.* It's nice and loud.Here is what bothers me a little :* Charging port is horrible. It goes in on an upward angle. Does not feel or look stable.Makes me wonder WHY is it designed like that.* Battery life is less than the previous model(2012 Kindle fire HD) Does not last long on standby.* I wish the power button and the volume were NOT located on the back of the HDX.

The first, which I ordered before Christmas 2013 (a 16 GB machine, wi-fi only), had to be returned because of the blue halo-ing screen issue. Although I liked it, I already knew that if I tried the Kindle again, it would also have to have a larger storage capacity. So when Radio Shack had Kindles marked down for New Year's, I bit the bullet and grabbed a 32 gig. I am happy to report that the new machine does not have the screen issue and seems to work fine.My impressions of this tablet are that it is the perfect companion to tote around in lieu of its larger far removed cousin, the iPad. (True, the iPad Mini is just as good for a 7\" tablet.) Although one is a modified version of Android, and the other is iOS, they pretty much do the same thing, which is give the user the ability to consume media, albeit on different levels. It is true that Apple does have a larger app selection, and that some Google apps are totally shut out of the Amazon ecosystem--but I haven't found that to be a problem because the basic apps I want to access: News, Netflix, internet and a few others are available on both platforms. I also have no problem issue with the fact that the device only has a front facing camera. I don't Skype or use a tablet camera anyway, so it's a moot point. Both my phone and iPod 5th gen have cameras that work just fine when I want to snap a pix. People who complain about the lack really should research before they purchase an item. There are multiple review platforms on YouTube that show the actual device in real-world situations. Lack of knowledge is not an excuse when you have access to the internet.As for how the Kindle HDX functions, I will give it a thumbs up. The display is crystal clear, the sound is decent and the ability to access the content I want works just fine. It is true the tablet is linked directly to Amazon, but this isn't a problem. I am not a Prime member, but may go ahead and join later on. I also don't mind the screen saver-come-advertising, which often offers great deals in books I am interested in. It's not as annoying as I thought it would be, and I can always pay the 20 dollars later on if I decide I want ads removed.Overall, this is a nice little tablet to tote around, and covers everything you want at hand if you're confined to a situation where you want the basics without carrying around a laptop or larger iPad. Put on a nice case, throw it in a bag and go. You've got books, movies, email and internet on hand. Perfect in every way.One more thing I might mention. Yes, it is compatible with iTunes without having to purchase conversion software, and you can transfer your entire library to the Kindle with a few clicks. Sure, it takes a simple workaround, but the music transfers fine, even if you've purchased most your music through Apple, as I have.A+ to Amazon for creating an affordable, fun little tablet.

I received such poor customer service that I went out and replaced the Dell with the Apple PowerBook, their main competitor at the time. And, I never looked back. I have been a part of the Apple ecosystem for more than a decade now, and couldn\u2019t be happier. The design, the experience, the quality. Yes, I know, I\u2019m trapped in their rigid world and the man is holding me down.When they came out with the iPad the public said, huh? We don\u2019t need this, and then gobbled them up by the millions, because Apple had figured out what we were about to. People don\u2019t like to relax with laptops. Open that thing up and you feel the need to do something. It\u2019s because of the keyboard. It\u2019s an input device that is waiting, begging, for your attention. But a tablet is pure consumption. No work required. Just sit back, read a book, play a game, watch a movie. They adopted the Gillette model of business: They didn\u2019t sell the razor handles to make money, they sold the razor handles to sell you blades. The blades here are the apps. And Apple made millions off of the apps. Then came the followers with cheap, poorly made tablets to try and compete and each got smacked down in the process.So here I am with a first generation iPad, yes you read that right \u2014 first gen, and I\u2019m looking to upgrade. I\u2019m thinking the new iPad mini because I want a smaller form factor for flights. It\u2019s before Christmas and I\u2019m in BJ\u2019s. The Christmas lights are blinking and everything is warm and bright. I spy an Amazon Kindle Fire on sale for $99. That\u2019s interesting I think and I move along with the tasks at hand. The thought sticks in my mind and I start investigating the Kindle line. I\u2019m already in deep into the Amazon system; Being a writer my wares are mostly sold there, I need to follow Goodreads daily, and for movies I\u2019m already a Prime member. I take a hard look at how I use the iPad. Email, check. Browse the web, check. Watch some movies, check. But mostly I use it to read books and magazines through the Kindle app. I abandoned  iBooks  years ago. I should support my biggest professional partner, I think, and then start really looking at the Kindle line. Amazon, too, follows the Gillette model. They are selling the HDX almost at cost so that it is easier to buy books, apps, and anything else that Amazon sells.So I dig. I read. I go to Best Buy to showroom the models. And I\u2019m surprised. They\u2019re good. They\u2019re damn good. And they are half the price of the iPad with the same specs (64GB). I make a decision I didn\u2019t think I would two years ago when the first one came out\u2026I placed my order with Santa for a Kindle Fire HDX and waited for Christmas.Fast forward to now. Of course I got the Kindle as Santa is a close friend of mine and I have been giving it a stress test probably only seen in the Amazon Lab. Along with the Nexus 7 (Not Microsoft. Microsoft still doesn\u2019t get it, they want to make you work on the damn things.) there is a serious threat to Apple\u2019s market share. It is a beautiful piece of kit. Sleek and light with a rubberized back that makes it easy to hold while reading. The Kindle Fire is my new best friend. It took me a day or two to get used to where the buttons were but now I can\u2019t imagine them in a different place. The performance is amazing. HD games feel like they are on a console and reading on it is a joy. I know there are some complaints about the blue hue around the edges of the screen. It\u2019s there, but I\u2019m okay with it. Those that keep returning theirs because of the hue are, in my opinion, a bit of the Princess and the Pea. Myself, I\u2019m impressed and ecstatic about the device, and can\u2019t say enough about it. If I find something, I\u2019ll post it here but don\u2019t hold your breath.Will I give up my MacBook Air? Not a chance in hell. iPhone? Possibly. iPad? Yes. Kindle Fire HDX?

Firstly I will address the many issues people tend to have with this device and comment on my personal situation.Wifi - Setting up Wifi at first was a little shotty as my router had to be reset a couple of times to allow it to access the kindle. At random times it seems like it drops wifi but this happens infrequently and isnt all that annoying unless it is during a video.Blue Tint - This is noticeable on my device on white screens but perhaps I wouldnt have even seen it hadnt I read so many reviews on it. It really doesnt bother me all that much and I turn the kindle to dark view when reading anyways. Unless yours is really bad I think this is just people nitpicking.Battery - So far it has been pretty strong. I watched a lot of media on this device and I have seen it last anywhere from 7-12 hours. I have noticed it depends on strength of wifi and screen brightness mostly. I watched 4 episodes of Justified last night and it only dropped about 25-30%.App Store - This is one of those things that people can research pretty indepthly before purchasing the device, so why people complain about it is beyond me. They are missing some key apps outside of google play store but many of them can be sideloaded using 1mobilemarket or an equivalent. I have noticed the apps through amazon are generally a version or two behind but its not a deal breaker.I understand you cant do this on an ipad either, but I wish you could rename apps. I hate when I download an app from Amazon and it has a weird name and throws it off alphabetically when I am looking for it.Now for the positives:Screen - The picture on this device is immaculate. Watching media is very crisp and enjoyable even on the 7\" device. The colors are accruate.Speakers - The speakers are very good on this device, much better than expected. It is perfect for watching on your lap, table or bed. They dont get too loud but I have never, as of yet, needed to watch something with them a full capactiy.Media - One of the key selling points is the ability to download videos to the device for offline viewing. I have noticed that the xfinity app allows you to do the same thing that Amazon has promised w this device. There are not many great movies to download and people are upset w this through Amazon Prime Video, however the list of tv shows is exceptional. They have a lot where you can either view/download the videos to the device. Amazon prime is strongly suggested if you were to purchase this device.Reading - Reading is a delight on this device. Very crisp and sharp and I love that you can download overdrive and rent books via your library. The Amazon Kindle Lending library is very weak and if you are considering this as a reason to buy then forget it all together.Overall I am very impressed with this device and at $229 ($179 on cyber monday) it is definitley worth a buy. It is more of a media consumption device then a tablet so to speak. I notice that when I am using it I seem to run out of things to do on it, unlike an iphone/ipad but still I think it is a great device for the budget conscious buyer.", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Bought as a gift for my wife - she won't put it down", "Author": "J.

She wants things that \"just work\" so after debating between a Nexus 7 versus this, I ended up going with the Kindle.The special offers are unobtrusive and easily ignored. The screen is amazing - better than the iPad by far and pretty comparable to the Nexus 7 I use. She uses it for reading, Facebook, Pinterest, and a few other apps. Though I would prefer that Amazon just use the Google Play store she gets along well enough with Amazon's app store, despite the fact that common apps such as Google Chrome are missing.The Kindle also has some annoying limitations on customization. My wife wanted to change the background to a picture but apparently that feature is not implemented for some odd reason. She also wanted to rename it from Kindle #2 but apparently that is not allowed either. I think the tradeoff in being easy to use might have overstepped a bit here, as asking to put your own pictures on as a background shouldn't really be an issue, nor should renaming it to be more personally named be such an issue either.

My browser is pretty fast also and I think I use kindle more than my Note 3. I recommend purchasing a stylus pen because it really is a wonderful addition.Originally I had purchased a Galaxy Tab 3 7.0 and immediately returned it and was gonna purchase the Nexus 7. The Tab is very outdated and ugly. The sales rep at best buy recommended the kindle to me over the Nexus 7... played with the Nexus for about 30 to 60 seconds. Finally walked over to the kindle it was beautiful clean smooth and fast. Love at first sight....I was in love and wasn't leaving without it. Once home with it..disappointment hit. Wow, it's not customizable unless rooted was on the verge of returning it..but then something amazing happened. While reading one of my many books...noticed a play button...tapped it with  stylus and it began reading..so you could speed it up or slow it down...downloaded my financial apps,business then play apps...so my kindle is a winner!!!!!

I was really unsure about upgrading from the original Kindle Fire. My 1st gen was working well, but I read about the browser speed improvement and I wanted HD.  I am a Kindle Prime member, but I have to admit I have not been taking advantage of Instant Videos as I should. I use my Kindle for reading, checking out a few blogs, and playing very few games. I now spend more time with this Kindle because using it is so easy...no glitches.  One of the things I appreciate with the upgrade is the improved keyboard. You can easily find a comma. Some friends encouraged me to download some interactive games like Iconmania, Heads Up Charades, and True or False, which we have all played together. I watched a movie with very smooth streaming.

Using the mini-HDMI port on my HD 7, I'm able to connect the HD to projectors and flat screens.  The only reason this is a complaint is because my flatscreen does not support the \"mirroring\" technology of all the new Kindle HDXs.My wife prefers this to the Kindle HD 8.9\" because she can now download some \"Prime\" videos but understandably, not all.It's also nicer and more compact.

To tell the truth, I have been meaning to buy a similar reading device with tablet capabilities and couldn\u2019t figure out whether to buy the Nook HD, the Kindle Fire HDX or the Sony Experia Z Ultra. Of course it\u2019s a matter of money. I am not made of the green stuff and even a $300 expense is big enough for me to think three times before buying something first in order to try it out. I read all the reviews, all the personal experiences put out by people, but still, it isn\u2019t the same as having the thing at home to play around with.This way works the best \u2013 they sent the 32GB version that I had chosen in less than 3 days.From the moment I got the package in my hands, I was in love. It is simply great \u2013 it does (almost) everything an IPAD does at a fraction of the cost.First, the cons \u2013 as I am sure there\u2019s ample information on the pros.1. The camera is ONLY on the front \u2013 there is no camera behind the screen. Makes skyping and taking pictures just a tad harder. Not a dealbreaker though, given all the other great stuff this little tablet does.2.  The page turning is by swipes only. When you are tucked in a cozy comforter on a cold night, you sometimes wish for right/left buttons \u2013 again, a minor annoyance.3. The weight \u2013 it\u2019s a tad heavier than the Sony Experia Z Ultra. But honestly, if losing weight means spending $400 extra, I can do without it!4. The included charger is really slow \u2013 I spent the extra money for the power charger. Only I didn\u2019t spend $19.99 on Amazon \u2013 I got it on eBay (new) from China, for $5.22, free shipping. Still waiting on it, but its guaranteed to arrive in a couple of days.  Works for me!5. I am an Amazon Prime buff \u2013 in fact Prime content is the prime reason why I chose the Kindle. It works great \u2013 only your \u2018watchlist\u2019 shows perhaps a quarter of what you have saved. If there is a way to see the entire watchlist, I haven\u2019t discovered it (yet).6. The carousel is annoying. It pops up unbidden whenever the Kindle\u2019s turned on. I don\u2019t need to display exactly what books and movies I have purchased and would have preferred if there was a way to discreetly tuck them away only to be brought out when I wish.7. Browsing emails on yahoo can sometime be frustrating \u2013 scrolling is immensely difficult as the tablet, to me, seems too sensitive \u2013 whether I use a stylus or my fingers, it tends to pop open the email instead of allowing me to scroll thru the list.8. Downloading movies is not too cool \u2013 takes too long and if the Kindle powers off, there you go. Lost the portion that you had already downloaded and need to restart.That\u2019s the lot of semi-bad news, if you can call it that. To me, it\u2019s all stuff I can live with, nothing major. Here\u2019s the positive stuff:1. It is GREAT to watch a movie or a show on. The picture (we have a high-speed broadband Wi-Fi) is crystal clear; there is NO dithering or wait time as the video caches. It\u2019s like watching your own personal wrap around widescreen. You might think the size would be too small, but when you do watch it, the screen\u2019s placed close enough to your face comfortably and it actually seems like a much larger screen. Like I said, GREAT definition and clarity.2. The sound\u2019s amazing \u2013 clear, sharp and realistic. Even without headphones, it\u2019s powerful enough to give true surround effect and loud enough to make my wife complain. With headphones, you don\u2019t disturb anyone and the immersion is complete. BTW I bought JLabs Jbud J5 ear buds with this after doing some R&D; (read my review if you wish \u2013 I even bought an extra pair for the wife) and it\u2019s a perfect match right off the top. Tailor made for the Kindle Fire HDX.3. Reading books is easy, except that a couple of left/right/page turning buttons wouldn\u2019t have hurt. The light levels\u2019s just right and if a white page glares at you, voila, make the screen black, the letters white! Bunch of choices in terms of fonts (publisher\u2019s font included) and one can size them up or down as required.4. Browsing \u2013 the silk browser is really great. Fast, no nonsense stuff.5. People talk about the \u2018offers\u2019 as annoying \u2013 I find it extremely entertaining. Not just are the products good (no TV infomercials here) but also the entire ad experience is VERY unobtrusive. Flick it off whenever you wish and go back using the tab.6. Navigating the Kindle is great (except perhaps the carousel feature which I didn\u2019t like). Downloading documents and files, pictures etc is really fast, movies, not so much as explained in \u2018Cons\u2019.7. Best part is its portability. The 7\u201d is slightly too big to slip into the back pocket of my jeans and a jacket pocket is required. However if you do sort out the carrying issue, it\u2019s great to have along and works everywhere there\u2019s Wi-Fi.8. I took the Boingo Wi-Fi on the go service and so far haven\u2019t had too much trouble with it. Of course it\u2019s not as fast as it\u2019s touted to be and there is a tendency to hook you to the nearest network instead of the dedicated Boingo network, but hey, whatever works. I am not that finicky. It takes a bit of time to get hooked, but once it does, it\u2019s a strong link and stays hooked unless you move a few blocks.9. The case and paraphernalia. I definitely wouldn\u2019t recommend spending $50-60 on the recommended sleeves and cases. I bought the Fintie faux leather package and for $20 approx, got a nice collection of stylus, sleeve, extra USB cable and some other small stuff. Works even better if you just buy the Fintie case for about $9.99. You definitely need a bigger case to stuff all those bits and pieces though \u2013 the charger, USB, stylus, headphones etc. I also bought a screen protector and a TPU Gel soft skin cover to be used in parallel with my Fintie case as added protection. It\u2019s a tighter fit, but works perfectly.All in all, it\u2019s a GREAT purchase and I am loving it. Will be happy to answer any specific questions that anyone has.

I decided to go with the 30 day free trial of amazon prime and I'll be keeping that since I love the instant streaming and selection.  I also have a paperwhite kindle and was reading a book (Sycamore Row) and went and checked it out on the kindle fire and it was perfectly synced with no problems and no effort on my part.  I also loaded Words with Friends which I was playing on my mini ipad and that synced up with ease.  I couldn't resist the mayday button and I had a question which was responded to and answered by a very pleasant gal quickly.  That's enough to make me love it more since I hate voice mail and pushing a zillion buttons to get to customer service.

For the price of a Kindle Fire HDX, you will not find anything better. I'm not a techno-wiz or anything like that, I've merely had the opportunity to use different types of tablets since members of my family keep winning them in drawings (e.g. Galaxy tab, Nexus, iPad, iPad mini). I actually bought this one because I wanted a tablet and it was less than half the price of the others when Amazon gave me special offers.I was initially worried about how complicated it might be to use, especially since I'm more familiar with the iPad interface, but I found the Kindle to be quite easy to operate. If I ever had a problem, I'd have the best customer support in seconds with the 'Mayday' button.It's fast- it's never really had a lag for anything that I've tried. The buttons are out of the way, but easy to find and use. The sound is by far superior to all other tablets, as is the display. It also feels better in the hand then other tablets.As with all non-iOS products, it doesn't have all of the apps or usability that I'd like, but that will come with time. Two notable apps that are absent from the market are Youtube and Instagram. I'm sure more developers will jump on board, especially since this tablet has proven to be extremely usable.If you are looking for larger text or screen size, the 7\" might be a bit too small. Also, if you aren't an Amazon Prime member, the Kindle might not have as many perks (e.g. instant video, lending library, etc). However, it still is great as a standalone tablet (although I'd recommend using the Prime services with your Kindle if you choose to purchase it; they are definitely worth the price).All in all, it's a top-tier competitor in the tablet market and it's also one of the cheapest. If you're considering this and the iPad mini or Nexus, really look into the Kindle or try it out.UPDATE (December 2013)I finally had the opportunity to use the Mayday service due to a downloading issue. It was about 10:30 PM. I tapped the Mayday button and within ten seconds I was in video contact with a representative from Amazon. In less than five minutes, they were able to visually show me the issue with my tablet and help me to solve it. I understood every word that they said (it wasn't outsourced) and it was by far the best tech-issue customer service contact I've ever had. I can usually solve any issues on my own, but having this feature for the times when I'm stuck is very nice.Many other reviews have mentioned the display issues at the border. It's true, it isn't perfect, but I don't think its incredibly distracting (granted, I don't read with it alot).

After spending only a few moments, from setup to navigating through various apps (books, web, videos, etc...), I must say that the device is near flawless.  The unboxing and setup process were as effortless as anyone could hope for.  The performance is spectacular and allowed navigating around the various screens with lightening quickness.  The feel in my hands is wonderful, in terms of size, weight, shape, and texture.  Heck, I even tried out the Mayday button and I must confess it is probably the greatest customer service experience I have had in memory and probably ever.Finally, I come to the topic that has been discussed in so many prior reviews.  This display is beautiful, vibrant and precise.  Unfortunately, this perfection is inexcusably blemished by an uneven purple haze around its outer edges.  This haze is almost twice as wide along one length of the device compared to the opposite side and contrasts so much with the otherwise flawless display, that it provides a distraction I cannot live with.I literally fell in love with your \"near masterpiece\" in just minutes.  So much so that I mentally tried to convince myself that the many fine attributes outweighed this single flaw (\"Gee, maybe I'll get used to it?\"), but alas I realize that, like so many others, this is something that I cannot bring myself to \"settle\" with.I am returning your amazing invention with great regret and I hope that your talented team can resolve this unacceptable issue as quickly as possible.

The power and volume button being placed on the back is an odd design choice but one that you can get used to rather easily.

The 2 HDX's are the only Kindle products I've ever had to return. This has the potential to be a great tablet once the bugs are worked out.  The bugs consist mainly of dropped wifi connections, the tablet showing a pop up message that you're not connected to a network when the notification icon shows fully connected, and completely \"forgetting\" wifi networks on a regular (almost daily) basis.  The first one was \"buggy\" out of the box, and I had to do 2 factory resets before it would even connect to a wifi network and allow me to register.  I tried factory resets numerous times on the first one and finally returned it.  I then purchased another one and it functioned out of the box, but the wifi issues started within 24 hours.  I did a couple of factory resets and the issues persisted along with random restarts.  After researching the issue online, it appears to be common.  I contacted customer service...who are always fantastic simply to ask if they planned a software or hardware \"fix\" for these issues.  They offered to exchange the tablet.  In my experience, Amazon is always very quick to fix any software issues...but not so much for hardware.  The solution always appears to be to stand behind the hardware and exchange it if justified.  I've had fantastic experiences with their customer service department.  But then again we buy the majority of our groceries, toiletries, household items and gifts from them...so it's obvious we're very loyal customers.  But in this case after having the same issue with 2 units purchased 3 weeks apart, I opted to simply return the HDX and wait for future \"fixes\" or for my HD to break beyond repair.  My Fire HD still works great, and I don't need to spend $250 on a table with \"OK\" improvements that is buggy,  I read and watch movies.  The screen on the HDX is bettter than the HD, but the speakers aren't quite as good.  It's certainly lighter and detaches from the cover easier, but the Origami cover isn't true to the original.  The original \"origami\" cover would allow you to position the Fire in at least 3 positions including a slanted keyboard setting...the new one only does vertical and horizontal.  We use the video out on the Kindle HD a lot while travelling so the kids can watch \"safe\" shows in hotels rather than risking the exposure to ^%&$ on hotel cable.  The HDX can employ a wireless device, but it has no mini HDMI out like the HD.  While the volume buttons on the HD were poorly positioned, at least you could reach them while holding the unit in it's case.  When using the Origami case with the HDX the buttons are covered.  So the HDX is faster, lighter, smaller, better screen, better UI, worse speakers, worse connectivity and buggy.  The HD is slightly heavier and larger, fantastic screen but not as good as the HDX.  But it's a 7\" screen...I'm still trying to figure out why anyone needs that high of resolution on a 7\" screen...but people want it on a 4.7\" phone so...  The HD has better speakers and connectivity.  For those interested, the HD can also be \"rooted\" without losing the Kindle UI or access to Prime instant video features.  As of the time of this review, \"rooting\" HDX has presented issues for those that don't REALLY know what their doing.  Of course I would never recommend doing this either way since it voids the warranty, but at least there are ways to get that other \"store\" on the HD without losing all the great Amazon features.  I would have liked the 8.9 tablet, but I think it is way too expensive when you can pick up a Nook HD+ for about 1/3 of the price.  It has the \"other\" lay store and is easily adapted via the SD card slot to access the Amazon app store.

I still returned the free-trial 8.9-inch one but decided to purchase the 7-inch version, because the former was still a bit too large for my need (recall I have the bigger iPad and iPad2).The 8.9-inch version of this Kindle (the one that I free-tried) doesn't have the bluish borders, the 7-inch version does. I read about this issue while waiting for the delivery my 7-inch version while still using the 8.9-inch version and became concerned.

The display is gorgeous and the Silk browser is about a million light-years away from the original Fire.  The size and weight are perfect (don't underestimate the importance of the lighter weight if you're considering an iPad).  I've had no issues whatsoever with a flickering screen, WiFi connectivity etc that other users mentioned...my experience has been fantastic.As an Apple aficionado, I would still give my iPad a slight edge over the Fire, but only because of the availability of apps and the seamless syncing of all my stuff through iTunes with my iPhone and my Mac desktop.

The picture is vibrant, clear, and sharp.- It's faster than I thought it would be, including powering up and down. Much better than the third gen Kindles.- I'm able to play games like Candy Crush Saga and Wheel of Fortune without any issues.- Can access Netflix, Hulu +, and other tv apps!Cons:-The battery doesn't last as long as I had hoped when playing games but it's still better than playing them on my tiny smartphone.- The weight of the Kindle, while lighter than previous generations can feel heavy after using it for a while. This isn't a huge \"con\" since there are those tablet pillows I can buy to alleviate the need for me to hold it while I watch shows or read.- Every now and then, especially when the brightness is turned all the way up, the screen vibrates which can cause dizziness. It only lasts for a moment at a time but it can get annoying when it does it more than once an hour. When I have the screen dimmed it doesn't appear to have that vibration problem.Overall, this is a fabulous buy, especially for those of us who were able to get a holiday deal on it. Even full price, it's worth it. The Nook was looking good simply because it has access to Google Play and Chrome whereas the Kindle only uses their own proprietary shop (Amazon App Store). But after reading reviews from experts and consumers it seems the Kindle is still the better tablet. Besides, the way Barnes and Noble is heading, they may not be around long enough to support the new Nooks into the future. At least Amazon seems strong and doesn't appear to be going anywhere anytime soon so the Kindle will be supported for years to come.I highly recommend this for anyone older than 10 years old.

You can also change the text background in your books for example. you can read on a black background with white letters and the blue glare goes away. However, I received my kindle today and its already being shipped back. I don't think its a great buy for the price, yes the specs are great however the new Google nexus tablet is the same price for 32gb a frontal and back camera along with HD viewing capabilities. Further every tablet can download the kindle app or some type of e-reader app for books. The kindle tablet has limited access to the app market where android and apple are almost pretty equal. Amazon talks up a great game with this tablet, but I don't think it owns up to the price. Lastly I bought this to use almost as a portable laptop because I read you can VIEW Microsoft office documents. I first mis-read this for using Microsoft office. The kindle does not offer such a feature you can only simply view these things. Google you can't exactly use Microsoft office but does have word processing capabilities for all of us \"on-the-go\" and who can't afford the beautiful new window tablets.

I believe this note is a recent addition, but it would've been easy to miss earlier. It's close to the top of the page and is under the heading We want you to know, followed by Learn more about design decisions to help make an informed purchase. This links to the following statement: \"We want you to know...The Kindle Fire HDX 7\" has perfect color accuracy (100% sRGB), and we wanted to share more details around our display design decisions that helped us achieve this.You may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. All displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy. Most LCD displays use white LEDs, and then apply filters to extract the desired color. The result is oftentimes a compromise to tone and color accuracy, or--if attempting to address these compromises--an increase in battery consumption and, thus, device weight.We've taken a different approach. To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7\" at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20% improvement in power efficiency.\"So amazon's official stance is that the glowing blue border results from deliberate design decisions and is therefore not a manufacturing defect. We'll all have to decide for ourselves whether this is true and that all subsequent HDXs will have the same effect.I'm giving this three stars because I think amazon should've warned people about the blue border in advance. I do otherwise like the HDX in comparison to my first gen Fire and would give it four stars. I'm going to spend the next couple of weeks deciding whether I'll become accustomed enough to the blue border to no longer notice it (this is already happening to some extent).", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cannot borrow audible books from your public library with this kindle. Shame on kindle.", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1HBMKNEADWKAP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Amazon continues to attempt to make sure you have to buy audible books through their audible store by failing to write the code in this new kindle that would make it compatible with oneclick digital which is the app the public library system uses to provide audible books for free (lends them just like a library book).Now they could include in their description that the app will not work with this particular kindle version but than people might not buy the tablet.  After an hour of being shuffled, disconnected and otherwisw aggravated with \"customer service\" I was told that the app writers would have to change their app to make it compatible.  Unlike most free apps that run constant ads the one click digital app is provided by our public library who can ill afford to make those software changes each time kindle develops a new version of its tablet.  Since we know previous kindles have had the software written to make them compatible we also must logically conclude that they could continue to do so.  It does not take a genius to figure out why  the new hdx was made incompatible.  Shame on you for effectively eliminating many peoples ability to obtain audible content.  As there are many children's books available to lend out this is particularly disgusting.  As a parent would I prefer my kids listen to someome reading a good book or playing games or movies with zero educational benefit?  I wish I hadn't traded in my old kindle which did have the software to work with the app.As I could not return this until Monday I decided to try the tablets other features.

FORM FACTOR - Compared to both the original Kindle Fire and the Fire HD, the HDX is lighter and thinner. Edges on the back are curved though not fully rounded, they still make it easy to grip the device. I can comfortably hold it in portrait mode in one hand between my thumb and palm and type with the other hand. The size and light weight makes it comfortable for one-handed reading for longer periods of time. There is a power button and volume +/- buttons on the back. The buttons are as easily accessible in landscape mode, but I'm still getting used to using them in portrait mode.2. SCREEN - This screen is the best in terms of resolution I have seen so far, sharper than its predecessors. There is no blurring of images or text under bright or dark background screens. Try pinch-zooming on an image, you will see that the integrity of the picture holds up pretty well despite zooming in real close. Reading e-books on this screen is easier on the eyes than reading on an iPad. I personally prefer to use my old e-ink Kindle to read books, but when traveling I plan to use the HDX. It doesn't strain the eyes as much as most other tablet screens that I have seen.3. SPEAKERS - I briefly compared speakers of the HD and HDX by playing the same song and maximizing the volume on both. The Fire HD's speakers were definitely louder when cranked up, but the difference was not significant. The speakers on the HDX however have better sound quality compared to the Mini for sure. That said, I personally don't buy tablets for their surround sound. I mostly use a tablet either with headphones or connected to a TV.4. STORAGE - I bought the 16GB version and I am already thinking I should probably upgrade to the 32GB. Of the 16GB, there is perhaps approximately 11-12GB available for end use, just an estimate - I could be off on this. This leaves little space if I want to store my entire music and video collection on the device, along with pictures and apps. For an extra $40, the 32GB is looking like a pretty good option. That being said, if you have most or all your collection stored on Amazon's Cloud Drive which you can stream to the HDX, the 16GB should be good.5. SPEED - The HDX is noticeably faster than the original Fire, and also feels improved over the Fire HD. Apps and videos load quicker. The most noticeable difference in speed is when browsing. Browsing on the Silk platform is smoother and less choppy. The difference is more evident when you go back from the HDX to browsing on an earlier generation Fire or another device.6. BATTERY - The HDX came with a micro-USB power charger! Advertised battery charging time is under 6 hours. Once fully charged, run time is said to be approximately 11 hours. Plenty for an average user like me, I use it probably 2-3 hours at most on any given day. This is supposed to have better battery life compared to that of its predecessor.7. CAMERA - The HDX 7\" version comes with a front facing camera only for Skype or other video calls. I tried the front camera briefly, picture quality seemed good for Skype calls. The 8.9\" however, comes with both a front and rear camera. I myself don't really use tablets to take pictures, I have my phone for that, but if you would really like to take pictures with this device, the 8.9\" would be the way to go.8. WITH OR WITHOUT SPECIAL OFFERS - I have always bought the Fires with special offers to save $15. Figured I always had the option of paying this amount later and removing the ads if they annoyed me. However, the ads appear only on the lock screen, which I don't look at any way, so it doesn't bother me at all. If ads on the lock screen annoy you or if you want a more personalized lock screen, you can simply pay the extra $15 and it goes away.SOME REALLY NICE FEATURES:The following features, in my opinion, are a game changer in favor of the Kindle Fire HDX:1. MAYDAY - A one-button tap gets you online with a live support agent within an advertised 15 seconds (swipe down on the time on top of the screen, MayDay button appears as one of the options). You can see the agent, but the agent can only hear you (though I think the agent should be able to see you if you fired up the front camera, but that's only if you want the agent to see you). The agent can take control of the device and help with any questions you may have. I tried this service once, connected in 15-20 seconds, agent walked me through trying to stream video through Apple TV (wasn't compatible). Audio and video quality was good, but I just found it weird looking at someone while getting support. Maybe it'll take getting used to, I guess I'm just so used to getting support over the phone.As of now, I'm not sure if the MayDay service is provided for the life of the device, or for the warranty period only, or if there's a charge for the service once the warranty expires. If someone familiar with this can post a comment, that would be very much appreciated.2. OFFLINE PRIME CONTENT - This is another really cool feature that has been added. Prime videos can be downloaded to the device for offline viewing - extremely useful for travelers when you don't have wireless coverage or wi-fi available! However, note that not all movies or shows can be downloaded - there are titles that are available only for online viewing. I guess this probably has to do with the studios and what titles they have agreed to make downloadable. Nevertheless, as long as I can download 4-6 hours of content for a flight, that is all I need! Once I return from a trip, I can simply delete the movies and download new ones. With this feature, a lower storage capacity device becomes more viable because I don't need to keep downloaded movies on it at all times. I can delete and add as I wish. This feature also helps save on wireless minutes. You can download a movie at home over Wi-Fi and play it on the road without spending 3G minutes to stream.3. SECOND SCREEN - This feature is expected to be available soon so I haven't had a chance to try it yet. With Second Screen, the Kindle screen can be mirrored on to your TV. From the description, it appears that the HDX does more than just mirroring - you can stream a movie to your TV and then use the HDX to check emails, browse the web, etc - basically you are free to use your tablet for anything while it is streaming to your TV. If this is true, this is a major step ahead of what most other tablets are capable of doing in this regard. With my iPad, I can only mirror the screen but I can't use it for anything else while it is streaming to my TV. I am excited to try out this new feature, will post an update once this feature is made available.Note - In order to stream to your TV, you will need a Smart TV or a compatible device like PS 3/4. If you don't have a TV or device that can connect wirelessly, you will need a Miracast dongle that plugs into your TV's HDMI port and can be set up on your wireless network to communicate with the HDX. I bought a dongle like this for around $100 a few years ago, but I think you can now find them here on Amazon for $40-50 (you can search for \"Miracast dongle\"). It is possible some devices are unable to connect because of their software or other compatibility issues. So for devices like say the Apple TV or Google Chromecast, if they are incompatible right off the bat, you can search online for apps that make them compatible with the HDX.4. FREETIME - This is a neat feature for families with kids, both in terms of time and content management. (i) Time - We have two boys and we try to keep tablet time in check (one hour each day Fri-Sun). Sometimes it's difficult to get them to let go when their time is up, and the ensuing battle never ends! With this feature, we have the option to set a time limit so the kids know automatically when their time is up. We also have the option of leaving a category like reading without a time limit. (ii) Content - We can basically create a sub-profile within the HDX and choose what content we want to be available in there. This is like creating a tablet within a tablet in some ways. Within the sub-profile, we can choose what games, apps, videos they can watch, and also change the backdrop to make it look like a kid's tablet. Very thoughtfully executed design.CONs:1. NO HDMI - The HDX no longer has the Micro HDMI port that last year's Fire HD came with. I thought this was a great feature to connect the device to TVs particularly when traveling. This also made it easier to connect the device to audio receivers to blast music through external speakers. With HDMI gone, you simply have to rely on wi-fi to connect to a TV. Most hotels are not equipped with smart TVs in rooms yet. So if you absolutely want to use the HDX to watch videos on your hotel room TV, you will need to carry the Miracast dongle as well. If the lack of HDMI is a deal breaker for you, I think last year's Fire HD might be the way to go.2. NO EXPANDABLE STORAGE - It would have been helpful if the HDX came with a memory card slot that could be used to play movies or content from an external storage device. This would leave the HDX storage itself open for apps and other content that must be stored on the tablet to be used. Also, expandable storage would mean that the 16GB version of the device would be good enough. However, if you have most content on Amazon's Cloud or have purchased volumes of movies/music from Amazon, lack of this feature shouldn't be an issue for you.3. NO GOOGLE PLAY APPS - Even though it runs on an Android platform, the HDX doesn't have access to Google Play which means the selection of apps available on the HDX is limited. That being said, it is fairly simple to install apps that are not otherwise available within the Amazon app store. You can run a Google search on \"how to add external apps (or Google Play apps) on Kindle Fire.\" It's pretty straightforward. I have found that the downloaded apps work great. Just remember to NOT root the Fire when installing these apps.4. 7\" HDX LACKS REAR CAMERA - The 7\" comes with only a front facing camera for video calls, it doesn't have a rear-facing camera. I personally don't need a rear camera on my tablet, but if you definitely need one, you can go for the 8.9\" which has both a front and rear facing camera.ACCESSORIES:1. CASE - I bought two cases with the device - the Amazon Origami case and the Marware Origin case. Origami - more stylish, functional, various stand positions, excellent quality, $50. Marware - inexpensive at $20, stand, basic frugal choice.2. SCREEN PROTECTOR - The Kindle screen is pretty good against scratches, but I have put a screen protector on regardless. I got the Marware screen protector - good quality and keeps the screen clear like there's nothing there.3. MIRACAST DONGLE - There are several adapters you can find here on Amazon. You will need this for streaming to your TV if you don't have a Smart TV or a compatible wireless device like PS3/4.4. CHARGERS - If you need to purchase additional chargers or cables, regular Micro-USB chargers/cables will work fine.BOTTOM LINE - Compared to the previous Kindle Fire versions and other tablets that I have used, the HDX is lighter, faster, has an excellent screen, and is loaded with some amazing features. All this for $229 makes the device a great choice. Whether or not to buy the HDX is entirely a personal decision. In my humble opinion, the choices:(i) If you have a recent tablet like say the Fire HD and are contemplating an upgrade, the upgrade may be worthwhile if you absolutely must have some of the new features (like Second Screen or offline Prime content).(ii) If the new features are not that meaningful for your purposes, it may be better to stay with your current device and wait for the next round of device releases.(iii) If this is the first tablet you are considering, scroll to the top and add to cart.", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not a secure device", "Author": "Sclark", "ReviewID": "RM5PVQMEOK68P", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered the Kindle Fire HDX, based on all of the favorable reviews.  My only complaint is that the device is not secure, right out of the box.  While the Kindle may be great at what it is intended to do, I pretty much rejected it due to a lack of security and regard to my Amazon account.  I am writing this review as a word of caution to others who may order it:When you order the Kindle, Amazon will ask you if you want to pre-register it.  They are doing this as there were many complaints of registrations failing after customers received the device, so they pre-register it for you before shipping, to cut down the amount of calls to their support.  The bad part of this is that, straight out of the box, you can click on \"Shop Amazon\" and go straight into your account.  The app, or the Kindle itself, does not ask for your credentials.  What this means is that my Kindle could have been mis-delivered, someone could have opened the box, powered on the Kindle, and had immediate access to my Amazon account (settings, Order History....everything).  I was even able to go shopping and could have made purchases, all without being prompted for my account credentials.Even with a passcode lock on the device, once registered and accessed, the Kindle prompts you no further for your Amazon credentials.  For some folks this might be OK, but for others who loan their Kindle to their kids, friends, or are just plain security conscious, this may be an issue for them.

Bought the Kindle DX, then upgraded to the Kindle HD last year and purchased Amazon prime for the Prime streaming of TV and movies. So when they announced the new HDX would allow for downloading prime movies and TV shows I thought it would be fantastic. I use the Kindle for reading alot and also for watching the movies and TV episodes while exercising. So I thought with the new HDX and being able to download the prime TV/movies, it would be perfect for those hotels which have very poor wifi in the fitness room and I could also watch movies/TV on the plane.Well, watching the movies and TV shows are much better than the HD, but it comes at a cost, and to me it's a big cost. The reading experience on the new HDX is terrible. The blue/purple line is definitely noticeable, not only when reading but also on anything with a white background, including email and web pages. This is not actually a major problem for me but I can see how some people would find it distracting. My major issue with the HDX is the color of the backgrounds while reading. As noted in some previous reviews, the black background is not black, it's grey but my biggest problem is the white background. It's not white, it's off white/light yellow. When comparing to an iPhone/iPad and even the previous HD, it definitely has a yellow tint. The fact that it's a little bit of a yellow background wouldn't be such a big deal, but it's blotchy. Most of the screen will be a yellowish color while there are small sections that are the bluish white color. I notified Amazon of this and they sent me out a new one but the new one was actually worse than my original. The \"blotchiness\" was larger and the yellow color was more noticeable. Plus, the blue/purple color was more noticeable as well. I also went to Best Buy to look at the HDXs and the yellow color was on those as well. This yellow color in a lighted environment is subdued, but when you're reading at night in bed with the lights off, the yellow color and blotchiness is very noticeable.Another disappointment is the battery power. The battery doesn't last anywhere near as long as the HD. As I said, I read alot and before with the HD I could go weeks without having to recharge which was great with the amount I travel so I wouldn't have to bring the cords because I could just recharge back at home. However, with the HDX, I have to recharge every 3-4 days which means I have to bring the cords with me when I travel.The Mayday feature is NOTHING like they show on TV. The video is not very clear and the audio is very delayed. The service reps also don't know anything other than telling you to reset the device and then if that doesn't work, someone will call you back on the phone, thereby not even using the Mayday feature.Also, the screen on the HDX is no better in the sun than the HD, which I was led to believe it would be better. Not sure if this was a misunderstanding on my part, but it's not better than the HD. In comparison with the iPad (mini), the iPad is way better to read in the sun and I don't mean just a little better, but way better.I'm just very disappointed. I've never had any problems with Amazon before but it just seems they didn't think things through on the HDX. The Kindle has always been a great reading device, so it seems they wanted to improve the viewing experience for games and movies/TV to be better than Apple. But they did it at the expense of the reading experience, which is a big disappointment for those of us that like to read.I could continue asking for new HDXs, but what's the point? I've already seen 4 and they've all had this problem, and the replacements could be worse than the original like my one replacement already was. Do I go back to the HD? If I do that I lose the ability to download the prime TV/movies which is a great feature. Do I get a Kindle paper white for reading? Well, then I have to carry 2 tablets with me which is ridiculous. Should I purchase the 8.9 inch which supposedly doesn't have some of these issues? Well, the 8.9 inch is bigger, bulkier, heavier and more expensive and space/weight is a premium with the amount I travel. Do I begin using my iPad mini? Then again I lose the ability of the prime downloading. So I guess I'll keep the original HDX and hope Amazon addresses the reading issues on the next upgrade, but with the way they've been responding with these issues on the HDX, it seems like they don't think the issues are a problem.So, if you'll primarily use the 7 inch HDX for gaming, and viewing videos, you'll probably really enjoy it. However, if you plan to read a lot on the HDX, this is probably not the device for you.", "Date": "January 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very Impressive", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"jlambert1982\"", "ReviewID": "RML3THOX9TJ06", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros:The size.

In fact, if I didn't use my phone's hotspot to give this thing connectivity I would consider dropping my phone all together and using this thing to make calls from.The screen.  This thing looks amazing.  A co-worker has the new iPad Air. Side by side we both think this little guy blows it out of the water.  We pull up the same images from google and it is easy to see the difference.The performance.  My biggest complaint about the 8.9 Kindle Fire HD was that it was laggy.  Pulling up apps would take too long compared to my Galaxy S 4 or my son's iPod touch.  Apps would crash before they opened.  Videos would stall between clicking play and the video actually playing.  This little powerhouse has eliminated almost all of that.  Apps still crash, but I'll get to that later.Cons:Storage.  I live on a farm.  Beyond satellite and cell coverage I have no options for high speed internet.  I do get LTE where I live, but that is on a limited basis, and my satellite broadband has a data cap as well.  It would be nice to download season's of television while I am at work or travelling and store them on my device.  64GB seems like a lot, but between apps, books, audiobooks, and HD video, it still fills up fast.  A 128GB version would have been worth it to me.Video output.  On my Kindle Fire HD I could bring an HDMI cable with me wherever I went, and as long as there was free HDMI input on the television, I could watch my videos.  Now I have to watch through my PS3 (which I could already do with Amazon Instant Video) or the newer Samsung televisions (but not my 2011 55 inch LED).  Kind of frustrating.  Even my kid's iPod Touch has HDMI out with an adapter.App availability.  I love Amazon App Store.  It is a lot easier to navigate than Google Play, and you don't have the multitude of worthless apps.  However, there are tons of apps that I use on my phone that just are not available through Amazon.  I use Google Voice to check voicemails and send messages.  While I can do that through the Silk browser, why can't I have that option?  Everyone I know who owns a Kindle Fire has their own personal complaint about an app they can't use.Summary:I love my HDX.  To me, this is the perfect size for a tablet, and this thing performs like a monster.  It has replaced all my other tablets.  I still have a very large library of movies and TV shows in iTunes, and it continues to grow b/c of my wife's love of her iPhone and my kid's reliance on their iPods, so I can't just shut down my iTunes account yet.  For me personally, however, I'll never have to use iTunes again.  Everything this device is supposed to do, it does great.  It is a great e-reader.  It is a great video player.  It is a great music player.  I started reading comics again when I bought the 8.9 inch Fire HD last year because of how great that device was for the comic book format.  The 7 inch HDX is just as good.  Note taking, game playing, time killing.....You name it, this device does it.Right now I don't know who I wouldn't recommend this to.  Thinking about spending 150 bucks on your kids and buying them a LeapPad Ultra?  Spend the extra money up front and get them a device that is worth the money in the long run.  Between the free apps and device quality, that is a no brainer.Have grandparent who watches old TV channels and reads books?  Give them this and tell them to pay for Prime, and cancel their cable bill.My only complaints are minor.  I knock off one star because I don't like the idea of being locked into their ecosystem of apps.  That is very Apple of them, and while I understand the business to it, I still don't appreciate it.  If I could make any improvements, I wish Amazon would let me import my library of videos from iTunes to their cloud like they did my music.  If they could make that happen, I would be a fully converted form .mac fanboy.Buy without hesitation if you are a Prime member or just starting your digital video library.  I would hesitate slightly if I had thousands invested in iTunes videos and apps, but even then, for $230, it may be worth it just to see if you like it better.", "Date": "December 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice tablet but still room for improvement", "Author": "Brian", "ReviewID": "R398UH9UFG0YA1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've previously owned one other tablet -- the iPad 1.  I received it as a birthday present ~3 years ago, and sold it last year back to Apple as part of their buyback program.  I liked the iPad, but found it slightly too heavy, wide, and slow (after upgrading iOS).  The screen resolution also was subpar compared to modern standards.Fast forward to today and I've dove head-first back into the tablet world with the 7\" Kindle Fire HDX.  All of my complaints stated above are no longer apparent with the Kindle Fire HDX.  It is light, narrow (can easily grip with one hand, although not as narrow as the Nexus 7), and whip-fast.  Screen resolution is as crisp as they come.My biggest complains are that (1) the ads are semi-annoying, and (2) the whole \"user experience\" appears to revolve around the consumer buying a bunch of stuff from Amazon.  With the Nexus 7 or iPad, there is less emphasis on \"buying stuff\" and more emphasis on \"doing stuff\" (e.g. a less commercial experience).Still, for the price ($179 on Cyber Monday), I can't complain too much.  I will say, though, that depending on the promotion at the time, if the Nexus 7 and Kindle HDX are the same price, I'd probably actually prefer the Nexus 7 for a more traditional tablet experience.  Sorry Amazon.

If I hadn't been a satisfied Amazon customer for the past 15 years I would have returned my tablet and demanded my money back. But I knew from past experience that this is not how Amazon usually operates, so I didn't give up. When I ordered the tablet and accessories I was promised promotional credits plus amazon coins plus bonus credits for some of the app purchases. Half of the credits promised did not show up in my account, and when I tried to use the credits I had, additional credits were deducted that should not have been. After many calls to Amazon, it was finally discovered that a computer glitch was the cause of the problem and it was corrected. My first tablet was difficult to use and some of the menu options were missing and I didn't know it. The online help files did not include descriptions of problems that can occur with a defective tablet so I kept thinking I was doing something wrong. (It would be extremely helpful if the help files could be downloaded as a PDF) After many calls to Amazon, I was finally transferred to a very unpleasant technician who determined my tablet was defective and sent me a brand new replacement tablet exactly like the one I had. When I asked about all the books and apps I had downloaded into the device he told me they would be in the new tablet when I got it. He lied.......the tablet was empty just like the original, but it was a new replacement so I didn't complain. It took me 3 days to reload 246 books and 65 apps into the new tablet........it would be helpful if there were a \"select all\" option in the cloud but there isn't and if the downloading is not monitored it stops after a short time. I now have a Kindle Fire HDX that works as it should and no longer regret my purchase! This tablet works extremely well and the graphics quality is amazing!

I've owned Kindles in the distant past and have not been impressed with e-readers or tablets in general.  I'm an old-fashioned book reader and really didn't think I'd like an e-format.  Plus, I wasn't convinced that I needed another electronic device since I have a laptop.  When Amazon pitched the no-interest offer over 5 payments, I reluctantly ordered the Kindle.  I have to travel soon and the thought of lugging my usual pile of books was not appealing.  I have been absolutely blown away by the functionality, ease and intuitiveness of this little device.  I used it right out of the box and put it through a good workout.  In the few days that I've had this, I've already received a $3 offer for free music (which I snapped up right away) and a free book (which I learned comes once per month - cool).  I've downloaded free books - classics that I've really wanted to read.  I've watched my Prime Videos and Netflix and the sound without headphones is remarkable!  I'm a news junkie and most of my news apps were available.  I like the Silk browser, and for what I need it for (checking and answering email), it works.  I don't game, so I don't know much about these functions.  You save a bit when you order with \"the special offers\" included and they're not annoying at all - in fact, that's how I learned about the free books.  In hindsight, I'd probably go up in size to the larger Kindle if I ordered again.  My husband has an IPad and I have to say, I like this Kindle so much better!  I also recommend getting a cover for this - it's a good investment.  I saved a bit by buying off brand, but you might want to invest in a true Kindle cover to protect your device.

Not only was the quality very bad, Kindle support is horrible, via both chat and on the phone.  The Kindle recently died, the battery cannot be charged, even when using a different charger.  They will not provide me with a replacement since I gave the Kindle as a Christmas gift.  I gave it to my niece who is 10, so of course she does not have an Amazon account and cannot call to get the Kindle replaced.  However, Amazon will not replace the Kindle when I call as they claim I did not register the device, but they verified that I did purchase it as it is in my order history.  Again, it was a gift, so I did not register under my email, but the recipient is 10, so of course she cannot go online to register it.  So after contacting Amazon three times for this issue to get a replacement Kindle, I am still stuck with an unusable Kindle.  The device is 5 months old...After contacting Amazon Kindle support a fourth time, someone finally helped me.  After explaining my situation, she was able to send out a replacement, but I had to give my cc number as collateral.

HD movies looked, and the speakers were some of the loudest I found on a sub 8 inch tablet.The OS is quick and responsive, but the whole carousel layout feels a bit cumbersome, but it's merely a minor gripe.I think the only major flaw I found on this tablet was the lack of micro SD expansion. I purchased the 16 GB, and I was immediately bothered to realize that I only had around 10 GB of actual storage to use. 16 GB's of minimum storage should have been removed a long time ago. With HD streaming being the preeminent way of enjoying movies, it should have come as no surprise that most 1080p movies were going to be larger than the 10 GB that remained. I don't see why they couldn't add a small slot for an expansion. This is where the HDX falls to the Samsung Note 8.0.Other than that, it's a nice little tablet... I do have a little buyer's remorse.

The HDX does its primary role, that of consuming Amazon prime media (I'm a Prime member) very well.  It's screen is sharp and the color rendering is very good so reading books and watching movies you rent, buy or get free as an Amazon prime member is a very good experience.  Thus, if you can live within that construct I think you will be happy.My problem was I wanted it to do more, and there's where it gets smoked by the admittedly far more expensive but also admittedly far more capable iPad min retina and also the similarly priced Nexus 7.  I found I needed my tablet to do some serious internet surfing, but folks, let's be honest, Silk may have improved over time but it's still arguably the worst browser out there.  It is slow, clunky, and struggles to render accurately many websites I visit.  And yes I did install the Dolphin bowser-not as straight forward a task as I'd hoped-and it's better than Silk but still weak compared to surfing on an iPad mini or a Nexus 7.Then there is the Amazon app market, or lack thereof more accurately.  The apps are poor in their number and often horrendous in their quality when compared to the Apple app store or Google play.  Yes, yes I know you can root the HDX and access Google Play, but if you're going to go to all that trouble why not just buy an equally affordable and very more capable Nexus 7 running stock Android?Finally, I have to say the stability of the Fire OS based on archaic the Android Jelly Bean version the HDX uses is bug ridden and ineptly designed and almost forces you to root it just so you can install an updated Android OS and dump the pitiful carrousel launcher for something far better.So, if you can live within the HDX's limited role of consuming Amazon media I think you will be happy, but the moment you try to go beyond that I think you'll envy anyone with an iPad mini or Nexus 7.", "Date": "April 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Australian (international version) lacking", "Author": "Vinny", "ReviewID": "R16X1M58ZS7AM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you are expecting the Mayday button: Prime: Movies: Share your screen: print functionality (for now) to name a few for Kindles bought through the .au Amazon store then you won't get them.

I expected to only use it as an e-reader, but it turned out to be one of our best electronic purchases ever.  That Kindle went with us to many interesting places over the years.  It's small enough to fit easily in a purse or a hotel safe, so it was our family's take-along device when traveling. With the reasonable price and small size, it was perfect for trips.  Free game apps keep the kids entertained on a rainy day of a beach vacation, not so expensive (compared to an iPad) that you worry about it being stolen when it's in the hotel room or broken while sneaking in one last roller coaster ride before heading to the Orlando airport.  The Acrobat Reader app allowed me to take hundreds of pages of work-related reading material with me to Europe without having the extra weight in my suitcase.  I read a lot, and my local library has thousands of books available to borrow for e-readers, a very nice supplement to the ones I've purchased for Kindle.  The untimely death of the previous Kindle was my fault: I dropped it, glass-side down, onto a ceramic tile floor and the glass shattered.  It's still working, but now in a plastic freezer bag so I don't get (more) glass shards in my fingertips.Now that I know what my Kindle needs are (50% reading, 50% apps and web surfing), I chose the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" as the replacement.  I  considered the iPad and iPad Mini, but this Kindle has more features and better resolution for a lower price.  I also looked at the larger Kindle Fire, but I really need my e-reader to fit in one hand, so the larger size is a disadvantage.  We own Apple products, so it's not like we avoid them, Kindle Fire HDX 7\" better suits my needs as an e-reader and tablet.Several things have been upgraded on this one compared to the earlier model.  My favorite is the ability to categorize books.  I have a pretty big library already on the cloud, still working on downloading and sorting through the books.  The screen resolution is better, not meaningful for reading but great in combination with Amazon Prime movies and apps.  I haven't had reason to use the camera yet, so no comments on that.  I also haven't tested the battery life on this one, but on the previous version I found that the battery lasted much longer when the wi-fi was turned off.I am very happy with this new Kindle.  The screen size allows great portability and it can be held in one hand, not too much bigger than a paperback.  Battery life is fine, screen resolution is beautiful  Available apps are great.  This time around I also purchased an Otterbox case, so I hope to not have another review to write anytime soon.", "Date": "April 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "KINDLE rocks.

The Dolby sound quality from the speakers is phenomenal for so small a device, but the volume level doesn't go very high and at its top volume it is only what I would consider as being barely satisfactory.  If there is any background noise at all you will have problems hearing it unless you are using earphones or a headset.  My biggest complaint about the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" is the location of the on/off button and the volume control. Both of these controls are under the sloped edge of the pad and if you have a leather cover for your Kindle Fire you pretty much have to remove it from the cover to access these controls.  I think the unit would be better if the control switches were on the edge like they had with the old B&W; 7\" Kindle with the keyboard.  I'm finding that to get a nice leather cover like want I am having to have one custom made.  One other item that I think would make the Kindle Fire HDX better would be a USB port that allows you to use a Flashdrive with it.  This would allow you to access movies and documents from an external source without having to use a computer to transfer them via a cable.  I have a lot of movies on DVD's that I wanted to view on my Kindle Fire HDX 7\" when I travel, I was able to find a program to convert them to MP4 format, but I discovered that when stored in the \"myflix\" folder on the Kindle I need to use the PHOTO selection on the Kindle to find them and not the movie selection, this is rather confusing especially since no instructions came with the Kindle.

Cook", "ReviewID": "R2XQWM0FEHYNPA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I ordered this Kindle as a Christmas gift for my spouse.  I usually do very thorough research before ordering online but I messed up on this one.  With all the hype about the HDX, I assumed it would include GPS.  My lowly ASUS has it so why wouldn't the much hyped HDX?  Otherwise, it has some nice features but I just have a hard time getting past this major shortcoming.  The video is very good, audio is better than on the ASUS but I prefer headphones to the built in speakers on any tablet.  Processing speed is pretty good but perhaps the most impressive feature is the \"Mayday\" live help.  I've only needed it a couple of times but when you need it, it's there and I was very impressed with the quick response time and the knowledge of the operator.Not a big deal to me but another standard feature on my ASUS Transformer that's missing here is an HDMI connection.  It does have Bluetooth. Wireless is a little stronger than the ASUS. This tablet also lacks a memory card slot and a rear facing camera, both of which are included on the ASUS Transformer.Other than the lack of GPS, the most irksome thing is that you're pretty much locked into Amazon for content.  Many things I would get for free on Google are not free or not available on Amazon. Oh, and did I mention, unless you get the more expensive 4G version, THIS UNIT DOES NOT HAVE GPS?!  GRRRR!  The ASUS GPS works without a wireless connection as long as you load your maps and select your route while connected to a network and keep the tablet powered up.  Even if you have the 4G version of the HDX, I would not assume that GPS will work without a 4G connection.  Otherwise, why would GPS only be available with 4G?Revision 3/27/14: The Bluetooth is picky about what it will pair with. Can't connect with my Samsung mobile headset. It is also extremely picky about wired headphone jacks. Some work sporadically but many don't work at all. Some only get mono even though they give me stereo with other devices (like my computer or my ASUS tablet). So far the only headset I've found that works reliably and really well is a (fairly pricey) Sony Walkman in-ear headset with headband.  I've also had my first poor experience with Mayday since I first posted my review. It took a very long time to finally be told that the tablet is not compatible with my Samsung Bluetooth headset. To sum up, I don't doubt this device is very good for reading books but that's not what I bought it for. It's pretty adequate for web browsing but lacks several features that are standard on many if not most Android tablets, many of which are less expensive.

The processor is amazingly fast and the graphics engine is top of the line.  Response times are instantaneous and I have found no lag in the OS.  I'm not sure how they do it but the sound and volume on this thing is incredible.  The keyboard has swipe built in and it works well plus I also like the ease of adding new words to the dictionary. The ability to add your own words to the dictionary is incredibly useful for customizing your Kindle Fire to be adapted to your personal way of thought and speech. If you are a member of Amazon Prime the Kindle Fire is a one stop experience for shopping, books, games, and video. The real problem is in the limited OS that Amazon has created to push its app store.  This could cause problems for people who are, like myself, used to the full access of the Google Play store which you cannot use. This also means that apps that are free on Google Play might cost you money on the Amazon store. This tablet also doesn't have flash along with all modern Android and Apple products. Flash is available on Windows tablets if that is something you need. Gaming seems to work well except for some second screen features, like Battlefield's Commander app, on my Xbox One. Second screen does allow me to use the Kindle Fire as a keyboard and mouse for the Xbox One which makes surfing the web and navigating menus much easier.

Maybe even increase the cost of the device. This, in turn, would likely cause customers to become more unhappy then they are with just the current approach, and at both \"store\" owner companies.I wonder if I could send my current device in to \"upgrade\" it's storage, or 4G capability, or to remove its adds, or something else at some point in the future for less than the cost of buying a new one, but I guess that is something to ask Amazon directly or look into on my own to see if such a thing exists.Anyway, I love my KFHDX7. Works great, has a good battery life, the screens colors are wonderful. The one I bought has a good screen size. It came with a good charger. The charger is one thing I absolutely love right now.

Also, when I want a book to read, I scan the titles and click on the ones that look interesting to me, but when I go back to the previous page of the list of books, it doesn't take me back to where I was and I have to start scrolling through them again starting at the first one.  I miss being able to click on the top of the screen to get to settings.  Regarding email, several times now I've forwarded an email and it comes to ME from ME instead of the person I forwarded it to, and the original one I forwarded from has disappeared.  The lousy battery life is my main complaint, however.  My husband has an iPad, and he charges it maybe once a week.  Next time I'm buying an iPad.", "Date": "March 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Convenient and dependable", "Author": "JHL", "ReviewID": "R3W52D8K458UKS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am really enjoying my Kindle Fire so far.

I based my purchase on reading reviews from other people on this website. Overall I am pleasantly pleased with my Kindle fire I can surf the Internet at a very fast speed, and I love the free apps it came with. I did not choose the special offers package because I do not care for a lot of advertising. The apps are easy to download and so far my Kindle is very easy for me to manage.  So far I can use my Kindle for two full days and not have my battery run down. The only downside to purchasing this Kindle is the fact that I had to pay $14.95 for the Microsoft Office feature. In reference to another persons comment on here I would like to verify the truth when it comes to Microsoft Office you do need the Internet in order to download the app but you do not need it to type or use most of the basic features. I was able to type a full research paper on this Kindle for my Geography class. So in my opinion it does the job I will update in a few more months after I've had a chance to use a lot of the other features hope this helps.", "Date": "March 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome!!", "Author": "KB's", "ReviewID": "R17MYACBTDVPT5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought it for the wife and what an awesome tablet.

I have to say I love it. My wife was able to try out the 8.9\" KF HDX and while the movies were beautiful on it the size was not for me since I read a lot, so I got the 7\"Screen = sexySound = It's a mobile device so I dont expect anything spectacular, that is where ear buds or headphones come into playCPU = Speedy little thing, quite impressedBuild Quality = SolidBattery Life = Great but like everyone else I want longer! :)Storage = 64GB and am happy Amazon offers this size and would love to see a 128GB or 256GB model in the future.OS = meh...... Read about it below.Bluetooth = WinWiFi = stable and solid I am an Android user and I like stock Android. I understand Amazon is trying to make it usable for anyone of any age sort of deal, but my biggest gripe is the freaking carousel (please fire the person/s responsible for this decision!!!) Please make a way to customize or just flat our disable for your customers that cant stand it. Second is the silk browser... I mean really come on! Why not use the default browser or Chrome that is part of Android, they are decent and average browsers that dont have issues with 60% of websites when loading them or hanging on the other 40% at random times. I just use Firefox Mobile to resolve this issue. Third and this is more of a personal issue that pops up from time to time since I got the Kindle Fire HDX and that is the seemingly constant need to be connected to the internet. When I am at home not a problem, when I am on the road really not a problem as I can use a hotspot (but do I really need to?), when I am at work that is really impossible as I have to keep it in airplane mode if I want to even bring it with me. This poses an issue sometimes when it needs to verify licensing to run some apps or play some games during lunch or waiting for code to compile, to watch a movie I downloaded from Amazon VOD so I could watch it while away from a data connection or a limited data connection in terms of data amount I can use. This needs to be resolved with all digital content that is usable on the KF HDX. I dont really have this issue when I use my Nexus 7 unless the app/game I am trying to run requires an internet connection for it to actually function due to the nature of the app/game.OK now that I got my negative out of the way lets add a few more good things to this rating.The app/game selection is pretty darn good, the game circle is cool but Amazon and Google need to make a love connection here with games that support G+ syncing so I can keep my saves of Reaper on my Android devices and KF HDX device. Don't think I need to play two separate games due to that (or at least make a way to export/import gave saves between the platforms). Digital content in terms of movies/shows and also music is great. I buy 99% of my content from Amazon as I can play the music on any platform and then stream video content to any platform. Then with the purchase of BR/DVD/Digital from the store if I cant add it to my Amazon digital library, then the support of flixster and such is available.I love reading books on this device, I have a ton of book I have purchased through Amazon and then ones I have as PDF from technical books I can send using the kindle address or side loading it. The good reads inclusion of the app is not as robust as the Android version or the website but it will do and it does let you see some other books based off of comments, ratings, and similar interest when you are looking for something a little outside your normal scope.Hope this helps other customers!", "Date": "February 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "A Got To Get", "Author": "Jeanne Klohr", "ReviewID": "R3TED0Z4OJJRG5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I wanted the HDX, I thought I would get the 8.9 display.

The screen is brilliant and beautiful, except for a few features which are not so pleasant.The purple/blue bleed people talk about, its real.  It is annoying and distorting.  I only read books in night mode, where the background is black, so the blue doesn't show up.The second issue is that in a large number of non-native apps, the screen flickers.  Sometimes it is just a little bit, once in a while, but in some apps, it can get to the point where it is so consistent that it gives an almost instant headache and makes the app unusable for more than a couple minutes.  I did find, however, that just hitting the power button and then turning it right back on again (so that the screen turns off but not the kindle itself) can temporarily get rid of, or at least greatly reduce, the flicker.Honestly, the display issues really make it feel like a cheap tablet.  Which is disappointing.  My wife has a first generation nexus 7 and I wish I'd gone for a second gen of that instead of the HDX.  We've found no issues with that tablet in the year-and-a-half she's been using it.A big upside is the ability to download free prime movies and tv shows (the downloadable ones are a much smaller subset of the free prime videos, but as someone who watches little tv, there's plenty there that I've never seen that will last me for a long time) which means having the ability to watch movies on the plane, in the airport, or in the train without internet.In all, the kindle is a good entertainment device for videos, but the screen issues mean it falls short of expectations in other areas, including reading and writing, which I'd expected to use my kindle for quite a bit.

I did a LOT of research before I made my purchase and decided that this Kindle was the best fit for me. I was not disappointed!There are a few drawbacks:1. No SD card slot so on-board memory is all you get. This isn't a problem for me, since I don't have a whole lot of apps and cloud storage is available. (LOVE the cloud storage!!)2. Google apps are not supported. Reportedly people have gotten them to work on their Kindle but I wasn't able to get them going. I adapted - I get my Gmail via browser and use an alternate mapping app.3. Battery life isn't quite what I'd like, but manageable.Now for the pros:1. The size and weight is just right. It is comfortable to use - even hours on end like I do2. Clear, sharp images. I was quite impressed by how good things look on the Kindle Fire3. Cloud storage so if you get overloaded with apps or books, you can save them to the cloud for later retrieval4. A wide variety of apps will run on the Kindle Fire, ranging from games to Office apps.Once I got the Kindle Fire, I realized that I'd underestimated how much I'd use it. I not only use it for reading (which I do a lot!), but I also have Skype on it, several games, and a bunch of work-related applications. I use it to do some work-related tasks when it's not convenient to be at my computer. With the apps I've collected, I can do all of my work - even work that requires VPN -  on the Kindle - it's that good!I'll admit that the Kindle Fire is not for everyone. If you are expecting a full-blown tablet, you may not like this. It's total overkill if all you want to do is read books. If you absolutely MUST have the SD card slot or MUST run Google apps, then you should look elsewhere.

First, it IS a fantastic device.  Incredibly versatile, lightweight, with an amazing screen.  I have always had (it's probably me) trouble using Apple products, as for me, they simply aren't as intuitive as others, and I don't like I-Tunes, so the HDX was a logical choice.  It is very reasonable in cost, and for those who need it, the Mayday feature is sure to be a big hit.  I've used it two times, (could have easily found the answer to my question myself, but wanted to give it a try) and the help Amazon gives IS all it's cracked up to be.  Very convenient. This device is super fast, and dependable.  I won't carry a cell phone, but with this, you can load on a free app from MagicJack, and you're good to go!  Free phone calls are always great, right?  So, why not five stars? As with most tablets, there are the occasional hang-ups while online, mostly while trying to view a video, say from Yahoo.  Can be frustrating if you're not ready to just let it go.....just don't need to see it that badly.  It can lock up the device.  Some videos DO work, but not all. Not a biggie though, just disconnect, get back on, and move on.  Hey, this can happen on my laptop, and who amongst us hasn't experienced that?  This aside, this thing is so easy to use, if you can work your laptop, or desktop, you won't have to learn a thing......no jumping through hoops like I-Tunes to load music......just drag and drop it from your laptop, and voila! Very intuitive. I bought, and suggest the 32gig model, just to be certain you'll have plenty of memory, as you cannot upgrade the memory.  The sound from the built in speakers is nothing short of amazing, and of course through the headphone jack as well.  Maybe I should have given it FIVE stars.  One last thing......I almost was set to pay for the 'NO OFFERS' (which you can also do at a later time if you don't do it when you first buy the Kindle) but was glad I didn't. The offers are GREAT, the screens shots are brilliant, and you find yourself looking forward to them when you power up. In addition, a simple millisecond swipe of your finger, and they're gone, and you're ready to go.

Since I bought it for my girlfriend and she says she can live with it, I'm not going to go though the trouble of having to return it again.

I want both, who are three apart, to have different settings.  They are continuously asking me to log them off to allow them to switch users.  Kindle needs to fix this.  I am about to buy a Asus tablet. My Asus tablet has a similar children's app to allow them each to have an account wit their own password.  This will allow them to log off each and allow the other to log in to their own account.  Second, you can't add memory.  Kindle solution is to have cloud storage.  wrong ideal.  Some apps like Real Racing is 4 gb.  After one month, I am out of memory without any videos downloaded from Amazon Prime.  We only downloaded six games.  Most other tablets can add a SD card to increase memory.  I own a Asus Transformer and love it. I just wish I bought them one.

Its fast, lightweight & portable, has an ever-growing selection of apps, and a BEAUTIFUL 7\" display. To show what this tablet is like, I will be comparing the HDX to the iPad Air(NOTE: these opinions come from a hardcore Apple user who is trying out Android-based tablets. I'm not being biased)\u00bb\u00bb Contrary to what most people believe, the HDX is actually better than the Air. For starters, the iPad air base model is $499... the HDX on the other hand, is $229. Its $270 for a tablet that isn't as powerful.\u00bb\u00bbSpeaking of power, let's take a look at the specs of the devices. The HDX has a 2.2 GHZ quad core Snapdragon processor + 2 GB of RAM. Thats more power and speed than most tablets on the market. The iPad Air has a dual core 1.3 GHz processor with only 1 GB of RAM. So clearly the HDX is way faster\u00bb\u00bbThe display on the HDX isn't as big as the iPad Air, despite being \"HD\". The HDX has a 1920x1200 display, and the iPad has a 1536x2048 display. HOWEVER, the pixel density isn't as high on the Air. The Air has about 264ppi and the HDX has 323ppi. So, although the display on the HDX isn't as HD, higher pixel density means sharper & clearer images. In terms of which is better, this one is really a toss-up.\u00bb\u00bbThe camera on the HDX is absolutely terrible compared to the one on the iPad air... at least on the 7\" model. The 7\" HDX lacks a rear-facing camera, and the front facing camera isn't too spectacular. Bump up to the 8.9\" HDX and you have an 8 MP rear camera that rivals the Air's 5 MP camera. If you're going for the 7\" tablet and the camera is the deciding factor, go with the Air. It has a better camera.\u00bb\u00bbBattery life is HUGE when comparing the tablets. The HDX is really good at conserving power. Amazon claims the HDX has up to 11 hours of battery life, and that really holds true. I myself have gotten even more than 11 hours of battery life. The iPad Air is a different story. Although Apple claims to have up to 10 hours of battery life, iOS 7 is a huge battery killer. I would be lucky to get half that amount with average use. I have a feeling that if iOS 7 was fixed to be less battery consuming, the Air would win this battle. So this is yet another win for the HDX\u00bbAesthetics & looks: Apple is known for its amazing product build quality and sleek look. The iPad wins this one hands down. It has a finished aluminum case that comes in two colors: Gray and Silver. The Air is also really thin & lightweight + it has small bezels allowing for more room for your content. It overall feels really solid. The HDX, though has a fairly sturdy build, is made with materials that look rather cheap. It has a rubbery-material back + is made with plastic... not aluminum. Although the HDX is also really thin & light, the iPad wins this one, simply because it looks nice.\u00bb\u00bbApp selection & software: The Amazon Appstore continues to grow, and certainly has thousands of more apps than it did when it first opened. But nothing can beat Apple in this category. The Amazon AS is rather limited. Its different from Google Play, which has much more to select from. Apple's AS has a huge variety of apps... overall a great selection. Amazon is just way too limited at this point in time. Also, iOS 7 is much nicer & has way more features than Fire OS 3. Fire OS takes the stock Android and modifies it to the point that it just looks terrible. You can't change backgrounds, you have very little customization, and the gray, drab colorless home screen & menus really don't help. Another hands down win for Apple.Overall, the HDX beats the Air in terms of speed, power, price & battery life. However, if you want a tablet that has more app selection, a nicer-looking OS, a good camera, and a really solid build that is aesthetically appealing, get the iPad Air.

Handy for checking emails, forums, and such, and very easy to use.  BUT.....Amazon and Google have GOT to get their heads together, and come up with a way for me (and others) to access the Android apps I've ALREADY PAID FOR in the Play store.  It's ridiculous the amount of functionality you lose not being able to access those apps.  If I could link this thing to my Verizon phone, and have all my Play store apps on this thing, it would've got 4 1/2 stars instead of 3.  Very disappointed that I have to hack this thing to be able to use it to it's potential.  And before you go all \"read about it before you buy it\" on me - I received this as a gift.  I had no choice in the matter...The other 1/2 star it's lacking is an easy fix, and it flat boggles my mind that Amazon didn't include it in the programming  -  NO HAPTIC FEEDBACK OPTIONS?????????  That's basic, kindergarten-level stuff some programmer left out, and it's beyond annoying.  Really would make this thing much more user-friendly if these buttons gave me some feedback when I touched them.So overall,  3 stars.  I'd be fine with recommending it as a purchase, just do your research first and make sure you can do without your Play Store apps.  And do NOT gift it to someone, unless they're on their knees begging.

Also, the origami case is not very substantial, and the only other option I have found for this device is the Otter Box--which costs almost $70.

I liked the concept, but had so much trouble with failures with them (I had and sent back 3 of them), that I got to know the tech support people pretty well.  I kept the last Fire HD I had since it semi-worked.  Finally, however, with much trepidation (and a $50 one day price drop) I purchased the new Kindle Fire HDX.  It has proven perfect.  It has not crashed nor given me blank pages or any of the myriad problems I had with my Fire HDs.I had read of complaints with blue/purple borders on the HDX, but I did not see it with mine.  My wife said she saw a faint blue tinge at the edges, but it was not bothersome.  I use my HDX almost exclusively for reading and I prefer the black background with white printing so blue/purple borders are not an issue anyhow.I think if you have been disappointed with the first generation Fire HD you will be pleased with the HDX, at least as an E-reader.", "Date": "January 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "i love it", "Author": "Melissa Kay Krause", "ReviewID": "R15G94MN9Y8O2Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is great.

It seems reasonable that there should be an easier (faster) way.  While I am computer \"literate\", it has been slow finding my way around all that the HDX offers.One of the reasons I selected the HDX was the availability of the Skype App.  When I installed it, however, Skype advised that they were blocking my account - because of a break-in that occurred in 2010. Everything was resolved by Skype and my bank, and I have been using Skype on my desktop ever since.  Working with Skype to unblock my account was endlessly frustrating.A minor point. I have used Every Word: Crossing on a previous Kindle.  I expected to use it on the HDX. However, after searching the Kindle website, I finally determined it was not compatible with the HDX. Subsequently, I purchase (it was free) the App Every Word - and received confirmation.  However, it was never delivered.  Your helpful tech determined that (again) it was not compatible with the HDX.  Not a crises - just a bit irritating.I have not yet used the Amazon Assist feature yet - but I think the offering is excellent.In one of the reviews I read before selecting the HDX, the reviewer commented that the On/Off button was in an awkward place - I agree.Thank you for the opportunity to comment.", "Date": "January 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Mayday", "Author": "murray johnson", "ReviewID": "R1RS3YKKPJ40QA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just wanted to give a little praise to the Mayday people.

It will be brief.  I LOVE MY KINDLE FIRE HDX \"7\"This is the journey I took before I settled on my HDX \"7\".Purchased Barnes And Noble HD 9.0. Returned it. Purchased Google Nexus 7 Second Generation. Returned it  Purchased Samsung Note 8 for an amazing $225 from Staples because of coupons and store discounts. No rebates to wait for. It was an incredible deal. Returned it. Purchased apple mini with retina display for $399. Returned it. Purchased Kiindle Fire HDX 8.9. returned it.The HDX \"7\" and HDX \"8.9\" are both amazing. I settled on the \"7\" because I bought it from BEST BUY for $239. The HDX \"8.9\" was $429 for the 32 gig unit. Four things. The Display color is awesome! The display screen resolution is incredibly sharp and the \"READING VIEW\" is a true joy when I'm reading digital media such as CNN and MSN. ( Reading View feature is only available on certain websites so  it's not on all the websites I browse but it's a fantastic feature to have!!) The audio is wonderful. I also am very impressed with the \"MAYDAY\" feature which connects you with a live technical advisor in 15 seconds by simply clicking on \"MAYDAY\". I can think of a few times when I wasn't and home received help instantly. The \"MAYDAY\" Tech. drew red circles on my screen so I could see what he was doing and fixed my problem remotely.

I asked all these questions through Amazon and Kindle sales and tech personnel through online chats before deciding on the purchase. As I stated the main reason for the purchase was to have the ability to rent or purchase each texts, but as I learn more about the Kindle. I decided the extra bells and whistles would be nice to have also. Another disappointment you give us a camera with absolutely no way to take good pictures because you can't see what you're taking a picture of. I still have time to return this product and plan on doing so, but I'll have to take a loss on the case and screen protector that I purchased in anticipation of my Kindle's arrival. I have lost count of how many people came up to me on campus, who see me with my Kindle and asked my opinion.

I wanted a smaller tablet but did not want to spend all that money ona iPad mini. I have a co-worker who has a Kindle HDX 7 and she loves hers so I decided to get one myself and so I'm so glad I did. I love that it's a size of a book n it works absolutely great. I love amazon n I'm a prime member. I love to read books n the Kindle fire it's so easy to carry around. I love that there are lots of movies you can download n watch without wifi. So if you go on a trip you can down load some movies or tv shows n watch them anywhere. The kindle fire has a clear beautiful screen. It's great to play games n also it has two speakers n that makes a difference. some people say that the speakers are not that loud. I have an iPad with one speaker n the Kindle sounds a lot better. I also like the special offers, it's nice to see what deals are going on. They only appear when you wake up the Kindle. Once you swipe to activate the Kindle there is no interruption with the special offers. I'm really enjoying the Kindle fire hdx. I'm not disappointed at all. I like it more than my iPad. I purchased the 32gb. More than enough for me. I think it's a great buy n I would recommend the Kindle hdx.

That's where the positive ends though.  The most integral part of the Kindle Fires are the internet, specifically, the Wi-Fi connectivity and reliability.  I have two of these, one bought from Amazon, and the other from Staples and they both suffer from constant network drops.  I originally had a Netgear Nighthawk R7000 and exchange that for the rock solid Asus RT-N66U and the issues continue.  I've assigned a static IP, enabled Airplane Mode and manually enabled the Wi-Fi and I still get disconnected.  I've updated my firmware on both routers and assigned manual DHCP for both routers and both Kindle Fire HDX's will not stay connected for a long period of time.After reading the Kindle forums, this is not a minor issue as many people are experiencing this with no fix in sight.  I'm really considering returning the HDX in favor of an HD but I'm sure that I'll miss the beautiful display!", "Date": "January 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Beautiful screen, fast processor; unreliable connectivity, marginal battery life", "Author": "Jonathan Prokup", "ReviewID": "R2P2XBSTKCA3DD", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "In spite of really wanting to like my Kindle, it falls far short of the expectations built around it by Amazon and many other reviewers.  I've had the device for a couple of weeks now, and have used it primarily for streaming videos via Netflix, reading books, and browsing the web.  On the positive side, the HD screen is beautiful, and delivers excellent quality for videos or browsing.  Likewise, the fast processor helps ensure that media is delivered more or less flawlessly (subject to the connectivity issue discussed below).  This is consistent with the Kindle's other strength, which is facilitating the consumption of Amazon content.Those positive things said, there are several issues that I have experienced that should give prospective purchasers pause.  And if the point of the ratings system is to help users assess whether to purchase the product, I would suggest passing on the Kindle and sticking with another Android-based device.First, the network connectivity is horrendously unreliable.  When connected to a wi-fi router that provides fast, reliable service to a variety of other devices (tested with an iPhone, an iPad, a Droid Razr Maxx, and a Windows PC), the Kindle for some reason cannot load any webpages or other internet content, even though it indicates having a strong wi-fi connection.  Occasionlly, if I restart the Kindle, the problem will temporarily resolve itself; however, even that step should be unecessary.In addition, the battery life is mediocre, even when the screen brightness is dimmed and the wi-fi turned off.  This tends to diminish the Kindle's value as a media consumption device, because the battery drains, sometimes at the right of 1% per minute or two.Finally, the Amazon app store remains a laggard - far behind the Google- and Apple-based offerings.  (Yes, you can side-load Android apps; however, once again, that's not a hassle that users should need to tolerate.)If you don't need to stream movies via Amazon (for which you need an Amazon device), go with another Apple- or Android-based device and just install the Kindle app.", "Date": "January 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "not impressed", "Author": "Jesica", "ReviewID": "R3MFXPSZBP4R14", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "If you are just going to just use it as an E-reader then that's fine.

It just takes some time to get used to digital copies.

The processing speed and memory are among the best for 7\" tablets.  The screen is fantastic, and even the sound from the speakers is impressive.  Another great feature is the ability to view Prime Instant Video.  Access to free movies and TV shows (some of them are even downloadable for off-line viewing) is an added bonus of having an Amazon Prime subscription.The tablet is also great for kids, or individuals who aren't very tech savvy.  Its very intuitive to use, and the parental controls are fantastic--even allowing parents to set a designated period of time that their kids can play with the device.  If you are a parent, someone who is looking for an easy-to-use device, or someone that simply wants to watch videos, read books, and play simple games, then the HDX might be your tablet.However, I was looking for a more traditional Android experience and I just couldn't get past the Fire's heavily modified Android operating system.  First, the operating system offers very few customization options.  For example, you cannot change the background screen, have access to widgets, or customize/organize your home screen as you would for other Android devices.  I also use the Swiftkey Keyboard on my Android smartphone, which has helped productivity when sending text/email, however, the keyboard on the HDX cannot be changed and Swiftkey is not available for the HDX in the Amazon Appstore.The real nail in the coffin for me was the inability to access Google services.  This means you won't have access to the Google Play store, which has a vastly improved app selection over Amazon's Appstore.  You also cannot access Google Hangouts which I use frequently for text/chat messages as well as video calls and videoconferencing.  Further, I use Google's Chromecast to stream video to my television. The Chromecast app is unavailable on the HDX.The tradeoff of purchasing another Android device over the HDX is the inability to use the Prime Instant Video.  Amazon has provided an Prime Instant Video app for Apple devices, but has not (and I suspect will not) produce one for other Android devices.  I'm not going to lose any sleep over this because I didn't find the selection of free movies and TV to be all that impressive.  The selection of free movies that were downloadable to the device for off-line viewing was even less impressive.  Most of my video viewing on the tablet was through HBO Go, Hulu+, or Netflix.All in all, the HDX is a decent tablet with great hardware that unfortunately stumbles on its software.  If Amazon were to offer a Kindle device with the same hardware, but with a more traditional Android software experience with a slight Amazon spin (a la the Samsung Galaxy Tablets), I would certainly be willing to pay a higher price for the device.", "Date": "January 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "It's Only O.K.", "Author": "fearn0evil", "ReviewID": "R2CIX400A3M8VY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Its alright.

My family has owned the original Kindle Fire the past two years roughly, and this one is way above that version.  Is it better than the Kindle Fire HD version?  Depends, but probably not if price is your biggest factor.Pros:1) iPad Contender - Seriously.  The iPad in my opinion is way overpriced for what it does.  The Kindle Fire HDX is just as capable at handling most of the same work flow with a couple of differences.  Yes, this is tied to the Amazon App store.  If Google Play was standard, then Apple might be worried.  Right now though, Amazon is crippling their own success.2) Fluid Performance - Smooth as butter.  I have played around with everything available for the past two months and it handles it all with excellence.  Games, work, reading, etc run flawlessly (app issues not withstanding).3) Screen - Sharpest resolution I have ever seen on a screen this size.  Made the original Kindle Fire look like a 10 year old non-HD television.  I could stare at this thing for days (but won't).  Reading, movies, games, etc are shown in perfect HD resolution.NOTE - The blue pixel edge issue is there, but it is not distracting to me.  I actually kind of like it.  If you read a lot on white backgrounds, then it pops out more than normal.  The haze falls to the background after I begin reading the first page of something, and I never notice it much any more.4) Micro USB Connector - Bite it Apple!  :)  No cord carousal here.  If you have a cord sitting around, it most likely works for charging or connecting the Kindle Fire HDX.  For the first time ever - a plug adapter is included!  Amazon is including a plug adapter so you can actually charge the device through a regular electrical outlet.  What a concept Amazon!  That might catch on with other electronics (sarcasm).5) Bells and Whistles - This thing has it all (mostly).  Dual-band WiFi, HD screen, Amazon support (best in the world), light as a feather, etc, etc.Cons:1) Amazon App Store (sort of) - No Google Play?  I know Amazon wants everyone to use the device for their content, but not allowing one of the largest app stores on your Android device seems illogical.  I am able to use 3rd-party app stores to upload missing apps and outdated ones on the Amazon App Store, but still!2) USB Connection Port - The connection port on the device can be a bit of a nuisance.  You have to connect it at an angle on the device (around 30 degrees).  Just irritating to me for some reason as everything else has it straight, so your mileage may vary.3) Mayday Button Gimmick - I am a computer-savvy person.  I don't need help on where to press the power button or tweak the brightness.  If you are buying this for grandma or a person that never has used much technology in the past 10 years, then this is a life saver for you (no more annoying phone calls).4) Battery - I get a couple days of heavy usage (8 hours) out of it.  I just wish I could get the Kindle reader battery life of 4 to 8 weeks.  :)Overall:This is finally the Kindle to put Amazon in striking range of Apple on the tablet front.  If you crave everything Amazon like me, then it is a no brainer to purchase this.  If you are not, then buy it anyway as you will save at least $100 over the nearest priced iPad.  If Amazon would just switch to Google Play for the app store, then there is nothing that would stop them from ruling the world!  :)", "Date": "January 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire HDX 7\"", "Author": "Melissa", "ReviewID": "R22FZPHTPJ6OYK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "New owned a Kindle or a Tablet and got this for Christmas and I love it!

I really appreciate the volume and the power buttons being on the opposite sides of the kindle now (don't know how many times I've hit the wrong one on my Fire >.<).Also, being able to have more than two browsers open on Silk now w/out it crashing all of the time is a great improvement.Some minor quirks - not sure if it's me or the tablet, but still trying to figure out how to get pictures already taken from my phone onto the tablet and directly into the photo folder.Have installed several apps without a problem, downloaded files and opened them, so far so good. The kindle goes everywhere with me (literally, it's the perfect size to fit in my purse). I wish there were more cover options for the 7\", but it seems to be increasing the longer the kindle is out, and I think a cover/case is a must for one of these. This is the kindle that I do take everywhere, and on a recent trip, I used this more than my Surface as it has my most frequently used personal emails installed on it (easy to set up), I can access my social accounts, my music, and of course my books.The battery is... eh, decent. I can keep it on and play music for a few hours, video less, and use it to read books for most of a day. It could use some improvement.All in all, it's a great tablet that you can take with you.", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Absolutely Love It!", "Author": "brfamilyguy", "ReviewID": "RAQOVL48DQ418", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I Love it!

I have spent quite a bit of time with technical support trying to resolve this issue, but so far haven't come up with a solid reason or fix for the problem. I have also spent time talking to AT&T; about the issue and they have done speed tests changed the router channel and tried other things to help me resolve this issue. The router is just a year old and AT&T; have run tests to verify that it is in good working order. I keep trying what Amazon suggests and hope someday soon to resolve this issue.

Totman", "ReviewID": "R37ZZZ2FQNQK00", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My sister has the original Kindle Fire. I was not impressed by it due to the unusual GUI, lack of true Android, and slow performance. I've owned every generation of iPad and type this from my 32GB iPad Air. I also own a Nexus 7 (2012).  I initially considered the HDX because of the special offers, namely the extra special ones where products are sold dirt cheap ($19 Paperwhite? Heck yeah!). But after buying the 16GB HDX 7, I changed my opinion. I ran out of space on it and returned it to order a 64GB HDX (at a much more reasonable price difference than Apple could ever dream of). I'm not ditching my iPad's anytime soon (too heavily invested in that ecosystem) but I can't stop gushing over the HDX. It's fast  the screen is crystal clear (blue tint on edges doesn't bother me), super light, and inexpensive.  I will always take it when I take a tablet rather than the iPad (which beg to be stolen). The origami case is also pretty impressive. I like how it holds on by a magnet and can easily be removed. And the folded stand is FAR more stable than the expensive leather Apple Smartcase on my iPad Air. As for the Nexus 7? It now feels far too sluggish and I hate the 16:9 aspect as well as the black bar that never goes away. I was using it for travel when working (looking stuff up in the field) but not when going to visit family or anything. I took my iPad but now will take the HDX to work and to visit family, etc.", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent tablet, welcomes you into the Amazon ecosystem with open arms.", "Author": "Mike L", "ReviewID": "RZMI8BQJVSODZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'd like to preface this by saying I am not generally a review writer. I have submitted one or two, but usually leave it to those more eloquent and well versed in the art than myself. That being said, I like to write about things, and why not write about stuff that I order off of Amazon.To be honest, I was going to give the Kindle Fire HDX a four star rating over a five, and that would have been simply for the apps available. I would really love to be able to access the Google Play store and have all the apps that I have on my phone, but that simply isn't happening, and I don't know if it's something that will be happening in the future. Amazon has their custom OS over Android here, and while it is a pleasure to use (buttery smooth and easy to navigate) it sometimes left me wanting for more as my brain would connect Android with Google apps and then not find them in the Appstore. The reason I did not let this bring my rating down was mainly because of the tablet's intended use. This is an Amazon-centric tablet, and as such can be considered as a portal through which to consume Amazon's content. I signed up for a prime membership as soon as I received the tablet and it's almost a necessity. Maybe not almost, probably just is.Having a prime membership really opens the Kindle up, giving one immediate access to all of the movies and TV shows that are marked prime and allows them unlimited viewing. If you're a reader, you're offered a free book rental every month, and hey, two day shipping for free gets you your stuff faster.My model came with the special offers because it was cheaper and they aren't obtrusive or annoying in any way. They present themselves to you as a screen saver, so when you click the power button (and it has a darn good 'click') you're shown an offer, and if you don't want the offer, you simply go ahead and unlock the tablet, start using it, and forget the ad ever happened. I can think of five things right now off the top of my head that are worse than having to see a brief offer on my screen. Not that I'm adamantly for them, they simply don't, and shouldn't matter to you.As far as what you're getting for the price, your money goes a pretty long way. The specs are in line with the best of them and the hardware is beautiful. It feels like a nice piece of tech in your hands, and that in and of itself, makes me want to use it. The screen resolution is amazing and it lends itself to the quality of the device as a whole. It's as crisp and beautiful as it should be, displayed on such a high quality piece of hardware.I actually have not tried or used the \"Mayday\" feature. As someone who is familiar and adapts very quickly to new technology, it feels like more of a novelty - to me. To someone with a less of a background, it's probably awesome. I simply haven't felt the need to use it, but it's nice to know that it's there in case I suddenly forgot how to operate things, namely Amazon tablets.In conclusion, if you have some money laying around, and aren't starving, go buy a Kindle Fire; they're cool.", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great fun", "Author": "nikki horner", "ReviewID": "RK06N7FNAL6HJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Does almost everything.

I tried with all my power to like the Kindle. But in the end, I will be returning this device. The hardware is excellent, and the user interface is pretty good as well. But odd behavior kept occurring. The device once went into a boot loop while I was at work without a charger. It continuously rebooted all day long. Nothing I did would stop the boot loop. Finally when I got home and plugged it into the charger, it booted back to the UI. I also have been noticing the screen flicker at times. It's more of an annoyance than a problem. There are other odd things that I can't recall at the moment. But ultimately, it's the battery life that prompts me to return the Kindle. Fully charged at 100% and left over night will find the device down to 88% without use. Then, when I pick the device up and actually use it, the battery is down to needing another charge within 1 or 2 (maybe 3) hours. Not heavy usage either, playing Candy Crush then browsing Facebook will do it. One time, I plugged the Kindle into charge before leaving for work, only to come home eight hours later and find that the screen was still on, and the device hadn't gone up 1% in battery charge. Another time, I plugged the device in for the night at 68%, went to bed and woke up to find the device charged only to 77%. Meanwhile, my Nexus 7 was at 14%, plugged in at the same time and was at 100% the next morning. I just can't have a device that I am constantly worried about keeping charged all the time. So, in the end, this device has been boxed back up and will be going back to Amazon.

I bought the tablet so I could watch my television shows while I eat without having to hall around my laptop around.

Which really impressed me! They pushed out some updates to me, gave me pointers on how to ensure I am on the tablet version of common websites (since videos won't work on all of the regular sites), and ABC published an updated app for viewing episodes. Now I am largely happy with the Kindle's ability to watch streaming videos. The only downsides I have experienced is the Hulu is not available (you can access hulu plus but not the free site), the volume/sound projection abilities don't seem as good as some of my other devices (like my ipod), and you can only have one window/tab open at a time. So for instance if I want to check the news during a commercial you can't do it- which is a downside for me since I am a multi-tasker.

The audio function will work for a few pages and stop on 1 title, or on another title stop at the beginning of each chapter, etc..  After several hours with 6 different people at \"Amazon assist\" , I now have been told a work ticket has been sent to developers about the issue and I will probably hear something from someone within 5 days.

They're not intrusive with whatever I might be doing on the tablet and if it bothered me that much I would just pay the $15 to have them removed. There are some deals that are exclusive to kindle fire owners which is pretty awesome and since I use amazon quite often for purchases, I don't mind a chance at snagging a good deal. There are plenty of apps to pick from (for my purposes anyway) like Facebook, Youtube, and a few games here or there. It's lightweight and easy to hold for reading while lounging around in bed and the movies I've watch show up in beautiful quality.

I have had a iPhone for 4 years and have become very accustom to the functionality of the Apple products.  It took me only 24 hours to discover how to navigate the Kindle.  And I LOVE it.All of that being said there is 1 thing I wish Kindle would chance.  Kindle does not have \"podcasts\" for download.  Some of my favorite news podcasts are not available on Kindle at all and what is available can not be downloaded ONLY viewed through streaming which only works when I am on WiFi.  This limits when I can view these programs.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worth the money", "Author": "Dr C", "ReviewID": "R1SF1G2YIKJ8OK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "... tho' I'm still getting friendly w/ it.

The Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" was  a Christmas present to myself, and it was a great price to boot.  I found the setup to be ridiculously simple (already having an amazon account and another kindle), but I think that even first time owners will be pleased.  The videos on HD are very crisp (using a high speed router and Xfinity), and optional \"Amazon Prime\" for $79 a year provides the owner not only with free 2 day shipping on all \"Prime\" items purchased, but thousands of movies and shows are included.  There are a good number of \"apps\" available (many are free), and hundreds of free games.  For the price, this tablet certainly provides a quality interface with the internet and is more convenient that sitting at a desk or carrying a laptop.  I have also found many books and guides (borrow from Prime or purchase) that will help users to get the most out of their Kindle.  If you love videos or reading, playing games, \"Skyping\", or even phone calls (yes, there is a way to do that), I believe that you love this tablet.  Your only decision is whether to spend more for the \"HDX\" version, which adds capacity and speed, or for additional memory.

But it's a great E reader.I wanted a good 7 inch tablet.  I bought a returned the Google Nexus 7.  It was great except for no browser having a reading pane which is important in a small tablet.  You would think Google would have this in Chrome but no.  The screen is the best in class.I went to Best Buy and they had the HD and HDX side by side.  I compared the internet and there was no comparison - they HDX was very fast so I bought it to try out.  Happy to report that this is now a true tablet in that the Silk browser is much improved,, the quad core makes all the difference, the internet is now very usable and fast.HDX also has improvements over the HD - you can slide up from the bottom to access recently used programs which is very important if you need to switch between apps since only Surface allows you to keep two apps open simultaneously in the tablet world.  This works better than iPad.A page from other androids - you swipe down to see email and other notifications.The power button is now accessible!Size is smaller and slimmer.Some have noticed that there is a purple haze to the background.  That's true and that's something you have to judge for yourself if it bothers you.There is a limit on the number of tabs you can open on the Silk browser.Battery life is improved over HD.  It now comes with a cable and wall charger.There is no rear camera.  If that's important to you, consider the iPad Mini.  OR you can buy a real camera for the price difference.In summary, there is really no reason to buy the HD unless the price is $100.  The HDX is now a good competitive tablet.  The app store remains a problem if you depend on apps for games.  I have found some surprisingly good specialty apps.This is smaller than the iPad Mini and almost half the price.

Since this tablet cannot yet be purchased in The Netherlands in a store, this was the only chance for me to pick it up and feel and explore it. I loved the design, the feel, the incredible clarity and mega-fast processor.Back home, I tested a lot of tablets at a Dutch local megastore. Google Nexus seemed appealing, then Samsung tab 3.0, but I disliked the shapes, too long/narrow screen proportions. LG Gpad 8.3 was another temptation, but again: that weird long narrow screen? I jumped on to Apple's Ipad Mini 2. Bigger screen than the average 7\" and just perfectly proportioned. Simply not being an Apple's type of guy, I hesitated. What held me back at Ipad Mini 2, were the limitations of dropping audio and video files on it. You would have to use Itunes for almost everything and convert many movie files.With Kindle, I wasn't sure about its Amazon-tunnel-vision strategy. But I also read there were a lot of ways to sideload apps outside the Amazon app-convent.From the day I received it (3 days after purchase, this gets UPS delivered to your doorstep and yes, they do ask your neighbours to receive it on your behalf in case you're not at home), I have not regretted this purchase for one second.I like Amazon products a lot. I do read Kindle books. But I like Kobo also. No problem, on youtube there's a perfectly clear instruction video on how to bring Kobo to your Kindle, and the two do peacefully co-exist.Magazines: lovely, cheap and easy to order, a delight to page through on this tablet.PDF files, Word documents: perfect viewing.For more extensive typing, I purchased the Perixx Periboard-805L, which works like a charm as a bluetooth wireless foldable keyboard for my Kindle tablet.Kindle Fire HDX 7 had my first attention, and remained my ultimate choice. Best case to keep it protected in my opinion: Poetic Slimline. Thank you, Amazon!

I bought this item to bring my 70 year old mother into the 21'st century because it has the mayday button.

I had the item mailed to me so I could set it up for her and absolutely fell in love with it. I have a Microsoft Surface Pro which is great for doing college work, or other computer related things. The Surface too can also double as a tablet (but because of the weight) not for long period of time. The HDX was so light, the resolution was fabulous for watching movies and to my dismay, the sound was better than on my Surface Pro!!

After reading reviews and doing product comparing on tablets, I decided on a Kindle Fire HDX.First impressions:I loved the look and feel but since this was my first tablet, I wish Amazon would of included more information and instructions.  It took me a few minutes just to unlock the screen.The plugin came with an adapter and I was thrilled because I didn't want to have to use my computer to charge.  The angled way that the cord goes in is a nice feature but made me uneasy the first time I inserted the power cord.Setup was very easy once I remembered all my login and password information.Charging time was about 6 hours which isn't too bad but I was quite impatient waiting.The first app that I downloaded was Candy Crush.  That process was easy and only took a few minutes.After a month of use...I love it.  The picture quality is excellent.  The sound quality is better than you'd expect.  I play a few games, browse Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest with ease.  You'd think you were on a computer with as fast as things load.  I've watched a few things and was really surprised by how good it looked.  I've also visited websites that aren't \"made for mobile\" and was thrilled that they work perfectly.Although I love my HDX there's a few things that I wish were better, improved, etc....Battery life.  I mainly just play a few games and browse a few places but the battery seems to drain kind of fast.  Just doing a few simple things each evening and I have to charge it every other day.  I couldn't imagine how often it would need to charge if I used it throughout the day.Availability of apps.  There's so many apps and games that are only available for Apple and Google so I wish there was more compatibility with Amazon and the Kindle Fire.Ability to watch YouTube videos without an app would be nice.Ability to play Java or Adobe Flash games or videos would be wonderful.Some questions...Care and maintenance.  What's the best way to ensure overall battery life?  Should I let the battery drain completely sometimes?  I have a case.  Do I need a screen protector?  What's the best way to clean the screen?With winter now here, how does the HDX do in cool or cold weather?  Should I keep it at a certain temperature for use or let it warm up before using?  What about summer heat?Like with computers do I need to clear the cache sometimes?  How do I maintain it?  Is there maintenance like on computers that should be done?  Are Kindle Fires at risk for trojans, virus', malware, adware, etc?  Is there a firewall?  What can I do to protect my HDX?Overall, I am VERY happy with my HDX and I'm glad I chose it.  I would recommend it to anyone that was wanting a tablet.  There's many things it can do and it is good for almost anything and anyone.

If you do your research, the Kindle uses blue LEDs instead of white. The blue backlight in the device allows less power consumption and it provides the screen with a vibrant crisp image.The bottom line is, If you are getting a tablet as a gift this season, right now at this price, it doesn't get any better.

I bought the Fire and made the right choice.  I've had this for a day now and am impressed by:1.Clarity and richness of the screen.  This is a perfectly good book reader; easy on the eyes2.Speed of processor, network access...it's very noticable (I have a Cisco E2500 router which takes advantage of MIMO and dual band)3.User Interface (users seem to prefer the native Android of the Nexus, but I actually like Kindle's simplicity)4.The Silk Browser does seem to be faster (x2-x3) than browsers on my Mac Air, or 4th Gen iPad5.Amazon's Prime video, etc. content ... I would download these anyway from another tablet, so why not AmazonThe biggest gripe of other reviewers seems to be Amazon's aggressive advertising and link to their ecosystem.  I have the special offers (cheaper) version, and don't really find the ads annoying (if I did $20 would fix that).  And I like the direct link to Amazon's content.  Nor does Amazon try to prevent you from sideloading APKs (they actually give you an installer on the device) nor from rooting (you can relatively easily install CyanogenMod I've heard).  In truth, I think rooting would be a big mistake, as you would lose out on Amazon's ecosystem without gaining anything.  The better route is to sideload the Nova Launcher (or there are several other launchers that do just as well) as they more or less remove any advertising, and give you a more conventional Android interface.  I make sure that I have links on the Nova Launcer dock to Amazon store and to Silk.  It's the best of both worlds.Update...I've had my HDX for two weeks now, and am pleased that Amazon has such a light hand in controlling their UI.  I've loaded the Nova Launcher on my HDX, with docked icons for Kindle Store, and Silk Browser.  The result is a better UI than IOS or Nexus 7.  Almost everything I want is sideloadable.  I tried sideloading GooglePlay (*HaHa*) but that didn't work for a fairly obvious reason -- Amazon did not want to be responsible for an App that collects payments outside their own ecosystem (it opens up a host of headaches for them).I purchased the NETGEAR Push2TV Wireless Display HDMI Adapter - Miracast and WiDi (PTV3000) and after a bit of fiddling (I had to load the latest update to get the HDX to mirror) had it working.  For those who don't know, this essentially provides the sort of display mirroring on a TV that you get with Apple TV and the iPad, but without the content limitations.  It works flawlessly, and I have been using this more than my Roku3 to watch movies, YouTube, etc.  The X-ray feature on Amazon Videos is nice (essentially access to IMDB database while watching a movie) works well, and is actually quite useful.I even used the Mayday button once trying to set up the Netgear Push2TV ... it works as advertised and Amazon staff are great!In my opinion for a variety of reasons which I would classify under the general rubric of Amazon's \"ecosystem\" the HDX is better than Nexus 7 and iPad Mini-Retina (which is ridiculously overpriced), which makes it the best 7\" tablet available.Oh... and be sure to buy the Amazon Kindle Fire HD Standing Polyurethane Origami Case (will only fit All New Kindle Fire HD 7\"), Mineral Black ... this is (if you  look at product reviews) an unloved and misunderstood accessory.  I was not impressed when I first got it, but now that I own it, I think it is the best case out there (though too expensive in my opinion).  The stand and magnetic cover work as advertised.  The tray that the Kindle sits in is magnetic and holds the HDX well, but allows it easily to be removed and reinserted.", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Outstanding with a couple of short comings!!!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3TAV0UJT1DPQX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great screen, but needs GPS CHIP.

Since my original review, I've had to return not only the original, but TWO more!!!  The first two would not hold a charge when in sleep mode.  The third one was charging for NINE hours and only made it up to 58% charged!  To make matters worse it came with no original box, which worried me as to if it was refurbished.  Amazon admitted it was a mistake and I was sent refurbished.  This has been a HUGE frustration dealing with having to call each time, packing them up and then making the 25-30 minute drive one way to our local UPS store!  I have no doubt I will love this device if I ever get one that works the way it is supposed to work!To date I have yet to receive an HDX that will hold a charge.  I am now on the 5th unit.  I cannot keep the internet on or will will drain within a few hours to dead.  In fact just downloading my latest books will drain at least 25% of my power that I had before turning on the internet to download the books.  Out of frustration I have kept this 5th one and just don't turn the internet on.  Now after just a month of using it, the screen keeps flashing like it is going to die/go blank.  This is the WORST problem I've ever had with any electronic device I've had!

There was a problem with me having too many Kindle devices registered, so my books would not open on the new device.  Even though I could have fixed that myself, contacting Mayday got the job done faster.  I talked with two Mayday operators since buying this new Kindle - both were easy to understand and knowledgeable.The sound and HD screen is very impressive, a big improvement over my Fire from 2012.  The processor is also impressively fast.  I have to say that battery life is not great, but adequate.  I have yet to try using the device with the WiFi off, which likely would improve battery life.

Each Fire model has been a significant improvement over its predecessor, although of course none come remotely close to the battery life of the electronic ink models.

Other reviewers have covered battery life for those willing to watch movies on such a small screen.  Being able to mirror movies from Amazon Prime onto my TV is good enough for my purposes.So what else is noticeably improved?  First off, the HDX is noticeably thinner, lighter, and faster.  Second, if your email requires VPN, there is an integrated VPN client that is almost trivial to set up (you may have to download the Thor OS upgrade for this, I did).  The provided email app connected easily for me. and I found new versions of apps I typically use, such as ES File Explorer and a really good (free) SSH terminal emulation app that works great on the HDX.I debated long and hard as to whether an upgrade from my HD was advisable at this time, and finally decided to take the plunge.

I put on the screen protector, put it in it's case, set it up with my acct information. I was in awe of the look and feel of it. It is beautiful! The picture and sound are amazing too. If you love Amazon, this is probably exactly what you want!I went into the situation blind. I read a lot of kindle books so I thought the Fire would be great. I didn't understand that a tablet would block you from using specific programs they deem competition. I use Google Music, I pay for unlimited music each month. It never occurred to me that I wouldn't be able to stream my music over my tablet! It doesn't make any sense to me! My HTC phone, which uses google, lets me download Amazon apps so why wouldn't Amazon let me use Google?!I went into chat with an Amazon rep to find out if there was anything I could do to get my music on it. They said no, they were sorry. They said I was free to buy music from them tho. Of course I am but I don't want to buy every stupid song that pops into my head. I'd go broke!And they don't offer anything like unlimited streaming that I could switch to.In looking through the kindle apps, I also learned that the Google apps that are offered (maps, gmail) had horrible ratings with comments that they don't work at all.I am a HUGE Amazon fan. And even through this, I am a loyal customer. But I am  so deeply disappointed. I am disappointed that they have chosen an isolationist approach to their product. Having my music available to me would not have taken any dollars away from them. I still would have bought my books and movies through them. Probably a lot more than I do now. I don't buy my music thru Amazon, I buy it thru iTunes. I always have and I always will. I keep my music on Google Music. I use the unlimited music to hear new songs so I know if I want to buy it or not. By not letting me stream music they've lost book and movie purchases. They never would have had much music business from me. Maybe some, bec I might be too lazy to use iTunes. The thing is, I have my way of doing things. I use many products. I don't want to feel contained or limited or be forced into changing for literally a BAD BUSINESS decision by Amazon.I wanted the kindle bec I thought it might be nice to use in the kitchen or around the house specifically for entertainment purposes. Reading, music, movies, tv shows. A sort of all purpose entertainment center. Like they advertise. What they don't say on their product page is that you won't be able to use Google services. It should be very specific for people like me who are new to the tablet world. I bought a case and protective covers and the warranty.  Amazon is charging me money for the returns and some of it can't be returned. I feel like they withheld important information and now I am paying the price for it.I did some research last night and decided to go with the second generation Nexus.

I am changing 1 star to 5 stars. After posting the original review, amazon contacted me and worked with me. I finally spoke with someone in the kindle support who could help me. The problem was the Comcast Arris Modem/Router I was using. Last friday, I bought a Netgear modem from Best Buy and an Belkin N+ router. All problems have disappeared. My kindle is now working fine. If you are having wifi problems and battery drain issues, it might be your Comcast router. Do not return your kindle, just get a new modem/ router and the problem should be solved.Original Review:**********From the outset, I want to state that I will not recommend the Kindle HDX 7. I own five Kindle devices, 4 Kindle HDs and 1 Kindle HDX. I had pre-ordered the Kindle HDX when Amazon announced it and I received it three days before it was sold to the public. Within a month of receiving the HDX, I had problems and had to contact Amazon for a replacement. They quickly sent me a new replacement kindle. The new kindle has been giving me lots of problems: disconnects constantly from the wifi, drains battery power even when it is not in use. Keep in mind, none of my Kindle HDs that are already over a year old have any of these problems. At first, i thought the problem was the Amazon kindle hdx case I had on it. I took the case off and still experienced the same problems. This has been going on since December. I have factory reset several times and the problem is still not solved. Last week I contacted Amazon, they sent me a refurbished replacement kindle (nervous knowing that the kindle I received had prior problems and that is why it is refurbished.). It looked used. I used it for a day and noticed problems with it. I contacted Amazon again and insisted they should send a new kindle because I am tired of driving to UPS to return defective kindles. The representative said he was placing an order for a new kindle for me. Today, i just got another refurbished kindle. I contacted customer support and I was told that as per the terms of agreement, a replacement kindle may be a used device. She informed me that if I have any problems with it, I should contact them and return it for a replacement. I am again nervous this might have issues again. I am crossing my fingers. If I have any issues, I will just return to a kindle HD. I like the new kindle because it is smaller and the display is better. Amazon will never tell us how many people have returned these kindles but I am sure a lot have been returned. I love amazon and I spend a lot of money on Amazon but unfortunately this might be my last kindle if Amazon does not make right with me. For now, I will not recommend the purchase of the HDX until amazon is able to deal with the technical issues with this device. I feel like I just paid $230 to buy a beta device.

I have currently:1.) Kindle Fire (1st Gen.)2.) Kindle Fire HD 8.3 (2nd Gen.)3.) Kindle Fire HDX (3rd Gen Fire)4.) iPad Air  (5th Gen iPad)5.) iPad Mini with Retina Display (2nd Gen iPad Mini)6.) Google Nexus 7 (2013)7.) Nvidia Shield8.) ASUS Transformer TF-101First, let me say I think the Kindle Fire platform is really nice when compared to the straight-up Google android experience.  Amazon does a great job of bridging the technical gaps for a user wanting to use a tablet and not have to constantly enter their email and password.  The Amazon docs, photos, music and video compare better in use to Apple's iCloud experience and makes the Amazon prime a solid investment.  Additionally, the horsepower of the Kindle HDX is amazing and makes this tablet for the holiday 2013 season a solid gaming platform.  My own benchmarking of the Kindle Fire HDX shows that gaming performance and CPU performance place this unit within the same performance bracket as the current generation of iPads and the Nvidia sheild.  Which is saying something when the HDX is half the cost of an iPad mini and 2/3rds the cost of a Nvidia shield.My disappointment comes from the screen on the Kindle fire HDX.  The HDX's screen shows a very visible and noticeable blue ring around the display's edge.  I've measured the blue ring to be one-eighth of inch along the long edges of the screen and slightly less on the short edges of the screen.  These blue edges really become notable when you are reading a book or browsing a web page that have white page backgrounds.  The blue ringing is much less noticeable when viewing the carousel page (which are grey) or running a app that uses something darker around the edges.I can not recommend the Kindle Fire HDX to my friends, family and colleagues because of what I consider to be design defect in the screen.

You simply tap the onscreen button and, voila, a person comes on your screen and helps you. A real person you can see. The can't see you, but they can see your screen. I've used it a couple of times and never waited more than 10-15 seconds before they were right there speaking to me. AMAZING!Second, the new rolling lyrics with your music is awesome, however,  not many songs have the lyrics yet. I'm sure they're working on the data base, but the more current songs are available. On some albums some songs are done but not all. Great idea and hopefully Amazon is bringing lyrics in quickly.And let's not forget xray for movies. Tap the screen and you'll get a pop-up with movie info like the names of which actors are on the screen at any given moment. Awesome!Awesome machine...

I honestly think the iPad Mini Retina and the Fire HDX are in a performance class all of their own!DISPLAYThe screen is super sharp and has incredible contrast all around, color accuracy is very high but, the backlight does have a soft blue glow around the edges.Now a note from my Eye Doctor, Increased intake of blue light into our eyes has raised the percentage of people who have degenerative disorders with their eyes and they recommend Yellow Filtered Lenses to protect your eyes.  Research Macular Degeneration and Blue Light to see for yourself and keep in mind, this is not exclusive to the Fire HDX but, their decision to use Blue Lighting makes it worth mentioning (this has always been an issue but, mobile devices and increased use of computers make it a much larger issue).SOFTWAREThe interface of the software only has one feature that bugs the check out of me and that's the Carousel, everything else with the OS and apps actually works very well and I'm pretty impressed with what I'm seeing! Oh and Silk works great if you stop it from accelerating page loading because, it crashes often with that on.Mayday is also a pleasant surprise and I've used it a few times for some quick answers. It was way easier than googling the answers and even my Apple friends were really impressed with it.Another issue was that Amazon noted that you could now download Prime Videos to watch on the go but, they neglected to mention that it is only a small selection of movies that can be downloaded so you're forced to stream them and that creates larger issues with Battery Life (see the Battery Section).Not having a YouTube App underscores a larger issue with the Fire line...  The App Store is severely lacking and many apps don't run right on the new tablets (Dead Trigger is upside down) and side loading apps often leaves you with apps that either don't work or don't work correctly 100% of the time!  This is a real issue and you would think that Amazon would want to stress the importance of getting these apps to work right out of the box!The Interface also has support for posting to Facebook and Twitter but, no Google+ and I'm not sure why Amazon is so intent on being Anti Google with their devices.BATTERY LIFEBattery is decent for every day tasks like Facebook, web browsing, emailing, reading books, playing a few games, and watching an occasional video clip.However, streaming movies from Prime resulted in a Net Battery Life of 5 Hours and that's half what Amazon claimed!OVERALLNo YouTube and using a blue back light has left me rating the Fire as average and I honestly think Amazon might have made a mistake with this screens back lighting. Everything else about the tablet is spot on and well worth the money they charge for it.For the record, even though I consider it an average offering, it is the best deal for the money and sadly, the other offerings might actually be worse than the Fire (the Nexus 7 FHD certainly is far less stable as is the iOS 7 based iPad line).Okay, two more notes that happened to me today...1st, the Tablet randomly decided to reboot itself while I was reading an ebook and that's twice it has done this in the kindle App.2nd, While I was tethering the device just decided it was going to download a very large firmware update without telling me it was doing it and needless to say, before I realized it my monthly data allowance was done!  I guess the only consolation here is that it might have actually fixed the first issue!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update 11/25/13The latest patch from Amazon appears to have remedied the lockup issue and I'm very pleased with it.Since the locks were happening however, I purchased an iPad Mini Retina and honestly, I find the fire HDX to be more responsive and fluid overall and the display is noticeably more vibrant on the Fire HDX.", "Date": "October 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing", "Author": "Krista  Timm", "ReviewID": "R2ECGWOAO5WR6E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a first kindle fire they released and I loved it but now I love this one more.
