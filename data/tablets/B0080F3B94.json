What I love, however, is the customer service that I received.  I initially had questions regarding setting up the notebook and those questions were promptly answered.  This week, however, I discovered that I could not find the charger for the notebook.  I emailed WolVol to find out how to order a replacement.  To my surprise, I received an e-mail stating that they were mailing me a charger at no cost!I received the charger today - three days after I e-mailed them.  Now that is customer service!

She is not very tech-savvy and somewhat intimidated by technology, so I did have concerns that this may be too tough for her to master (she is a Windows platform user and this is not a Windows platform). She tried and while the Notebook worked fine, the size was ideal and it was super light (which she really liked), in the end she just couldn't figure it all out. I did not find difficulty with it, but in the end it's about what was best for mom. We decided this was not for her and requested a return.

I would definitely purchase more from WolVol.  My Granddaughter is enjoying her Netbook very much.July 23, 2013.  Once again I had to contact WolVol for customer service. The password got changed on my Granddaughters netbook and she could not open the netbook to get to her files.  I contacted WolVol and they sent a chip to reboot the machine.  We could not get that to work so WolVol offered to fix the netbook at no charge.  No other company would ever offer to fix a machine that was purchased almost a year a go free of charge.  I will not hesitate to purchase another computer from WolVol or recommend them to my friends and family.
