{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A Competitive 8 inch Android Tablet - gives Samsung a run for the money, especially on price.", "Author": "Computer Tech", "ReviewID": "R23ACPIK2P0XLL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This tablet has been available for over two weeks and still no reviews yet!  So here goes.Looks just like the other Asus tablets (the MeMO HD 7 and 10) as far as the layout.  Here are the major specs:8-inch 1280x800 HD IPS displayQuad-core powered processor (AMD 1.6Ghz)30% more screen space than a 7-inch tablet5 MP rear camera and 1.2 MP front camera to capture life's momentsMicro SD card slot for expandability1GB DDR memory3950mAh lithium polymer battery with up to 9 hours battery life1 Micro USB portBased on owning the Memo 7 HD with 16GB and having used several other earlier versions of the Asus brand tablets, here are my observations for the ASUS 8\" tablet.Overall ASUS tablet comments:The 7 inch tablet has been average in reliability.  Expect the same for the 8 inch model.  I did have one instance where the tablet would not charge at all.  I emailed ASUS and received a standard troubleshooting email in 2 days.  While it was helpful and gave me directions on how to return the tablet if necessary, it did not solve my problem.  I was able to get the unit charged by using a high quality charger (yes, it was an Apple I-Pod charger that brought my ASUS HD 7 back to life.)  The battery life has been about average for a tablet.  You may want to consider a Square Trade warranty if you buy an ASUS tablet.The tablet is fairly robust and based on the specs for the 8 inch tablet (the 7\" MeMO HD is also a quad core processor), you can expect good performance relative to the price.  The ASUS HD 7 is overall good in terms of screen resolution and this tablet will probably be average as well.  Occasionally, it doesn't respond to touch as well as I would like.  It is also a fingerprint magnet (and I am usually not too picky about those things, but this is noticeable and worth mentioning.)  The ASUS MeMO Pad 8 looks so much like the MeMO 7 and 10, that I think you could reasonably say that it is of the same build, design, and quality only at the 8 inch size.  I would have liked to see 2GB of DDR memory for better performance, but the 1GB is sufficient.In the 8 inch tablet category there is now the following tablets in the order of my overall judgment of their desirability (see specs at the end of each for comparison purposes):Samsung Tab 3 8 - at 249.00, this is still a bit costly, but it is light, responsive and has a good screen.  Probably has a slight edge on reliability over the others.Specs: 1.5 GHz Samsung Exynos 4210 Dual Core processor, 1.5 GB DDR2 SDRAM memory, 1280 X 800 resolution, Mali 400 GPU, .68 poundsAsus Memo 8 - at 229.00, this tablet is a slight bit costly (when you consider the MeMO HD 7 has been seen as low as the $100 range on sale.)  ASUS is asking a slight premium for that extra 30% of screen space as compared to the MeMO HD 7.  Depending on your preference and the sale price, I rate the Samsung and ASUS a virtual tie for overall value/desirability.Specs:  AMD Quad Core 1.6GHz processor, 1 GB DDR3L SDRAM memory, 1280 X 800 resolution, Mali 400 MP4 graphics, .8 poundsDell Venue 8 - at prices ranging from 129.00 to 179.00 for the 16GB tablet, it is definitely worth a look.  Dell tends to be good on customer service and this tablet has 2GB of DDR memory which is definitely a plus.  One review commented on the lack of response for the touch screen, however reviews on Dell and Amazon's sites have been positive.  The Dell Venue 8 runs true android.  If you can get a branded 8\" pure android tablet for the $129 Black Friday sale price, the deal is hard to pass up. (Note: the Atom is an Intel processor and has to emulate the ARM-based architecture to run Android.) -- Update: as of 12/19/2013, Dell has released an update that has enabled multi-user profiles and it appears to be working without problems.  The Dell Venue 8 is also available with 32gb of internal storage for a list price of 199 dollars.Specs: Intel Atom Z2580(up to 2.0GHZ)Dual Core processor, 2GB DDR2 memory, 1280 X 800 resolution, Intel HD Graphics, .82 poundsAcer Iconia A1-810 - gets some good reviews and sells for about 170.00.  Slightly below the Dell Venue and kind of heavy at 1.01 pounds.  It also has a lower resolution than the other tablets, but it is still worth a look...Specs:  MTK MT8125 1.2 Ghz Quad Core processor, 1 GB DDR3L SDRAM, 1024 X 768 resolution, Integrated PowerVR SGX 544 Graphics, 1.01 pounds (Acer website lists weight as 14.46 ounces or approximately .9 pounds)UPDATE: December 8, 2013.The recent price drop of the ASUS Memo 8 to $199.00 makes it a bargain in relation to the Samsung Tab 3 8.  While the Samsung is sleaker and lighter and has 1.5 GB internal memory to the Memo 8's 1 GB DDR, the 50 dollar premium that they are asking for the Samsung Tab 3 8 is a bit high.  The Asus MeMO 8 offers a quad-core processor while the Samsung Tab 3 8 has a dual core processor.  The Asus Memo 8 and the Dell Venue 8 give a lot of bang for considerably less money.  The Dell Venue 8 offers 2GB RAM and is selling for less than either the MeMO 8 or the Tab 3 8.  Unless you want the tv remote control functions of the Samsung Tab 3 8 or are very much into the lightest tablet possible, Asus and Dell are offering attractive tablets for less money.  The Acer A1-810 is a good tablet, but maybe not quite on par with the others at this price.  The Acer A1-810 is recently selling as low as 149 dollars.Hope this helps you to make a good decision on purchasing a name brand 8\" android tablet!", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing price for such a great performer!", "Author": "R. Ngin", "ReviewID": "R3A0CI1DC81A5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had the tablet for more than a week since receiving it for Christmas. It has been a pleasure to use.First off, the main competitor to this tablet would likely be other 8 inch tablets such as iPad Mini and also the Galaxy Tab 3 8inch.Both are much more expensive and to be honest do not even bother looking at the Galaxy Tab 3 8inch.Unless you have fully invested into the Apple Ecosystem, I do not know why you really want to spend $400+ dollars on a tablet.Anyways back to the MeMO Pad 8.Performance:The MeMO runs a Rockchip RK3188 (Memo Pad 8) vs Exynos 4412 on the (Galaxy Tab 3 8inch)Quad Core 1.6Ghz vs Dual Core 1.5GhzHere are some test results on a different tablet that show the processor in the MeMO is much more powerful:[...]If you do not want to read the info, then i'll sum it up.The MeMO 8 CPU performs better and allows the system to run DDR3 Ram (faster).Both the MeMO 8 and the Galaxy Tab 3 8inch run a ARM Mali-400MP4 GPU, but the MeMO 8 runs the GPU at a faster speed (533Mhz vs 440MHz).Screen resolution is 1280vs800 which is fine, nothing crazy. Keep in mind that running a higher resolution also strains the system further and also draws on the performance so the resolution is fine. 1080p would have been nicer but the price would have to be significantly higher and I do not see either tablet being competitive in price compared to the iPad Mini at that rate.Anyways, on to other areas to measure. RAM on both tablets are different as well, the MeMO runs 1GB and the Galaxy Tab runs 1.5GB.That is 50% more and only really makes a huge difference if you load many apps at once and do not close them. For 5-6 apps running at the same time, 1GB is more than enough and does not lag the system down. Seriously though, close apps if you are not using them, any system would perform better, don't be lazy.Also the size, this is a big thing. A lot of people complain that the 7 inch tablets are small, they are, they are only a bit bigger in screen size than the smart phones of today. A pointless purchase. a 10 inch tablet is too large and bulky and can't be held comfortably with one hand. They are more for work than play seeing as most ultra books are 11-13 inches, slightly larger.8inch is the way to go. Much more screen space, 30% over 7inch tablets. Also when you buy a 7 inch tablet, the manufacturer must design a bezel that still allows you to hold it without touching the screen  which is consistent with the 8 inch tablets. So really you get a much smaller screen on 7inch, but still bezel is relatively the same which means the weight is not exactly proportional to what you would expect. Thus you pay for a small screen with a lot of extra plastic bezel with usually much lower performing specs (except nexus 7).All in all, the 8 inch is a perfect device to type, read, surf, watch videos and although it doesn't fit comfortably in any pocket, it is light enough to bring along pretty much anywhere. I love the damn thing and is sub 200$, really people, a quad core 1.6ghz system that supports microSDHC (btw it does not support XC, so format your XC cards to FAT32 to get them to work), 2 cameras, independent GPS, solid build, loud a$$ speakers (2watts per channel which is stereo), great vendor/brand I would say jump on it.The only things I would wish for in this tablet are a higher resolution screen, preferably 1080p, but only if it cost no more than 50$ more. 1.5 or 2gb of ram would also be nice. Slightly better camera, but not really, get a real camera but seriously people stop using tablets to record things, it looks ridic and you look really dumb.SDXC support would have been nice so that I can watch movies files that are larger than 4GBs. Also IR support would have been cool (Available on Samsung Galaxy 3 Tabs) so that you can use them as a big a$$ remote.That's it really, I love the tablet, not sure why people are buying Samsung Galaxy Tabs when this gem is out there. Also do not buy 7inch versions, seriously they are so underpowered and overpriced. They need to be sub 120$ for the specs they have.Anyways if you have questions please do not hesitate to ask by continuing the convo below!", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Present for Wife and she loves it", "Author": "Lucas Adam \"Lucas\"", "ReviewID": "R2RHDNO3LFZ77T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this tablet along side the DragonTouch R8 for my father, but i got this one for my wife. She loved her 1st gen kindle fire, but it was starting to show it's age and she had managed to fill the memory to where she couldn't do anything more.I bought this because i love the Asus Name. I have an Asus Laptop and an Asus Router, all of which i have found to be the most solid tech i have ever purchased.That being said i bought this for her and she was ecstatic. For an 8in Tablet this one is paramount. We did the basic tests, Heavy downloads to see if it'll bog down, and we ran the Antutu Benchmark. This tablet did much better than mine, and even looked smoother than my fathers R8. If you don't mind spending a little more an 8in tablet, buy this one. The Battery life is fantastic, the OS is smooth and stable. I also recommend spending $15 at Walmart for a 16gb microSD card to make this a 32GB tablet.I would also like to mention that the speakers on this tablet are RIDICULOUS. They are loud and clear as expensive computer speakers.

It was purchased for my wife who does not like to tinker with technology. She just wants to be able to easily download, read and study publications; watch movies; have access to the Web; and be able to display photos and videos for family and friends. I have a 1st generation Nexus 7, which has served me very well. It is now \"aged\", but It still works well for me and I have no complaints. But this Asus MeMO 8 (same manufacturer of Nexus) really impresses me. Why?I like the 8\" screen size for sure. Just like Goldilocks said \"It's Just Right!\" It is well equipped with some decent apps loaded on it, but is not so bloated as the Samsung tablet offerings. The processor seems smooth and plenty fast for what we use it for. I downloaded a few \"must have\" apps like Amazon Apps, Moon Reader, and an Office app, to make it more functional for studying and annotating publications; and MX video player for viewing a variety of video formats that the included player wouldn't; a CPR app and Netflix.As far as appearance goes, the white plastic case on the MeMO is attractive enough and since we have it in a cover, only little bit right around the screen shows anyway. The most attractive thing though is the affordability. I don't mind spending a little extra money for good tools. But this is a very well-priced tablet from a reputable company. I've been an Apple user since 1984. I love their equipment. It always has been the top of the line. But this is a MUCH better deal for most folks that have not already invested a bunch in their iPhone apps, etc. We have Motorola android phones that are setup much like the Asus tablet, so jumping from one device to the other is really easy. Contacts, calendars, and email all sync real easy through Google. And you can add as much storage as you'll ever need on a microSD card! Can't do that on an iPad. So, if you are on the fence about which tablet is for you, and you are not some competitive Gamer or Name Brand Snob, click the \"Buy\" button. In a couple of days you too will be enjoying a good book, viewing a video, or surfing Amazon for the \"next big thing\" on your MeMO Pad 8!", "Date": "January 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very Happy", "Author": "Wayne Barnard \"Happy Shopper\"", "ReviewID": "R3I090JT77VT0K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Looks great out of the box!

Phillips \"Longtime Amazon Buyer\"", "ReviewID": "R30B94RFVJJOYI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When I realized I wanted an Android tablet (my first - I'm an iPerson), I decided to go with an ASUS because I've had an ASUS laptop for years and it's never given me any problems. To me, ASUS means a lower price on electronics that are just as good as more expensive brands. I've only had this tablet for a week or two, so time will tell if will hold up as well as my laptop has, but so far it's excellent. Very quick touch response, fantastic graphics and video. I haven't played music on it yet, but from watching videos I think perhaps the speakers could be a bit better.If I have any complaint at all it's that I don't particularly like the location and pressure that needs to be applied to the power button.It's sort of on the lower portion of the side edge of the tablet. It takes a little feeling around to find it and press it correctly, especially when the tablet is in a case.The best thing about this 8-inch tablet is that the overall size is barely bigger than a typical 7-inch tablet, in fact it fits in an old universal 7-inch tablet case I have. I bought this with the intention of mainly using it for ebooks. It's a great size for that, but it's also large enough for PDF files and magazines.As an iOS user, I'm completely impressed with the Android operating system. It's not better, but it's definitely as good. And it offers more freedom to do what you want with your files than iOS does.I'd recommend this tablet to anyone looking for a good Android tablet under $200.

The screen resolution and size is really good, it connects snappily to WiFi, and just generally runs good all-around.  The speakers are plenty loud enough to actually use without resorting to headphones.  The battery life is more than satisfactory, and the battery holds a charge extremely well when you let it sleep with the screen off.  The power button is stiff and it takes a moment to power on, wake up or to launch a powerful app, but there hasn't been any real performance shortcomings once I'm running an app.Count me as a very happy MeMO pad 8 owner.

I decided on this Asus Memo Pad 8.  Features that drew me to it included the 8\" screen, and MicroSD card slot, and the Asus name.  I runs Android 4.2 (Jelly bean).When it arrived, the screen on the device looked quite nice as it was bright, and had good viewing angles.However, to my surprise I could not get it to connect to my network. I have a 1 month old router, and multiple other devices, including Windows 7 and 8 computers, a Sony Blu-ray as well as an Apple iPhone 5s connect via the WiFi without any difficulty.  I wasted hours on trying to troubleshoot this, and the Asus Memo 8 would connect for a minute, and then lose the connection, and then not be able to find any connection.  I ended up swapping out my router for another, and numerous reboots of my cable modem.This was all to no avail.  One I started Googling the issue, I found out that Android, especially version 4.2 seems to have serious Wifi connection issues.  This apparently has been known for a while, and I am not sure why Google has not fixed this via updates to Android.After spending too much time on what I can't fix, the decision was made to return the Asus tablet.

Lack of haptic feedback on this tablet is a complete disqualification as far as I am concerned. Same with the Dell Venue 8.UPDATE: had to change from 2 stars to 3 to be fair. It seems most other manufacturers are leaving haptic feedback off of all but very premium tablets. Even the new Galaxy Tab PRO 8.4 does not have it.

Surprisingly the 1 inch larger screen does make a difference,  while I was pleased with the previous 7 inch tablet the extra inch made it just a bit more usable. Things I had traditionally used my 10 inch tablet for were now possible on the smaller tablet,  email,  note taking etc. The change from the old tabs 1.2 quad-core to this 1.6 Rockchip quad (not AMD) was a nice upgrade not huge but noticeable. Of all the features the ability to use a 64gb micro-sd,  TF or which ever term you use is the greatest new feature.  The least welcomed change was that it didn't come with system software for APP to SD. Also while I typically connect to my cars Blue tooth for music with a creative Zen Touch occasionally I would connect my old 7 inch tab,  with this so far I haven't been able to.

I have played with the Nexus 7 and although a nice device, the screen size left something to be desired.  I didnt want a 10 inch tablet at the risk of it being unwieldy.  I still use a Desktop and Laptop for more intense tasks so I really just wanted an entertainment device above all.I searched and searched and found the ASUS MeMO Pad 8.  I have been really surprised by this device.  The screen size is perfect, not too big and not to small.  Although the resolution is not the highest there is, considering the price, the resolution is still just enough to display HD video.  Text on the device, depending on the font being viewed, can seem a little blocky at times but shouldnt be noticable to the majority of users.  This tablet has GPS, Bluetooth and WIFI.  I have never had problem connecting to any network or using the Bluetooth to connect to external speakers, etc.  The GPS features is nice for Apps that require a location based awareness to work and I have tried a few offline Maps programs and the GPS locks on nicely.  Unfortunately anything besides Google Maps is subpar, but Google Maps will not work unless connected through Wifi or a cellular network, which this device does not support.There is only one little flaw that I have noticed with this device.  At times, when you attempt to go back to the home screen, there is a lag of several seconds and the icons go through a complete reload.  Seeming that the software is resetting due to overload.  If you have too many apps open in the background and attempt to view an intense webpage you will notice some lag as well, but if you make a habit to close out of things not being used you should never experience a problem.The supplied charger cable stopped functioning after about 2 weeks.  The device comes with the wall connector and a seperate cord for charging.  The wall connector still functions so I just use one of my old mini USB cords from an old phone and have had no problems.Overall I am extremely impressed with this tablet, considering its price and everything that it offers.ASUS needs to refine a few things but 8 inch is the way to go.

See cons for why not 5.I moved from an Eee 9\" netbook (still working well) to a 7\" Nook Color running Android 2.3. The Nook was a valiant if slow replication of a tablet, but I decided that the time had come to upgrade. I researched as many options as I was interested in with some criteria: larger screen, faster, latest software, cameras and GPS. I ruled out iPads because I had an iPhone once and though Apple hardware and operating environment were great, I did not like the Apple \"mothership\" approach or iTunes interface, not to mention the premium pricing. I considered Windows 8 tablets because I like the Win8 OS on my main computers. But, considering how I had used my Nook and Eee and the applications I used, too many things would not be there on a Windows tablet. My experience with Android on two phones and the Nook has been generally good, so I had no problem staying in that environment. I considered everything from cheap Chinese no-name units (poor displays) to higher end name brands, looking mainly for the best balance of good user feedback and reliability, price, performance, and display quality. And no closed system like Kindle. I quickly determined that larger than 9\" display size was not so good to handle and tote, so I focused on the 8-9\" range. My choices narrowed down to Samsung Tab 3 and 4, LG, and this Asus based on my criteria. I am not an early adopter, preferring to let prices evolve and product issues sort out: e.g., too many problems reported for the Dell Venue. The Asus MeMo Pad 8 fits my needs perfectly and for $50-$150 less than my other choices. So far, I have not been disappointed.Pros: Very good performance, good bright display, good speaker quality, right size, price value, got some bonus free e-magazines.Cons: Almost no documentation included (have to download larger manual), latest KitKat OS not available.Neutral: Battery life adequate, a bit of bloatware but not bad.Upon activation, a system upgrade was immediately required but not, unfortunately, to the newest Android version. Getting online and configuring everything went well, but if you didn't know your way around Android or tablets in general, I think it would befuddle a new user. I have got most of my preferred apps loaded but was surprised to find a couple that worked on 2.3 that don't on 4.2 (What's your problem PayPal?). If all is well a year from now, I will be especially elated for the money I saved. I would recommend the Asus MeMo Pad 8.Update- Having used the MeMo Pad 8 for over a week now, I add a few observations:- Not fond of location of power button on upper right, but a matter of getting used to it.- Not fond of the screen keyboard functionality. May research alternative keyboards.- Somewhat puzzled about Android differences--what is due to Asus mods and what to ver. 4.2.2? There is no option to move apps to the SD card. The only SD card option appeared the first time I used the camera, which allowed pictures taken to be stored on the card. On Android Gingerbread, selecting an individual app from Settings/Applications clearly showed a \"Move to SD Card\" option for the eligible apps. Also, preferences could be set for music and media storage. So what good is having an SD card on the MeMo pad other than to store pictures? I don't intend to root this unit, and specialty apps that facilitate moving apps to the SD card don't seem to work unless the base system allowed it to begin with. Again, is this an Asus or Android 4.2.2 limitation? Upon research, I have discovered some options that allow file manipulation to mitigate this. I admit that I know little more about Linux-Android than how to get things to work for me...--Navigate to Settings/About/Software Information and tap the \"Build number\" field 6 or 7 times until you get administrator-developer privilege.--Under Settings/Developer Options have \"USB Debugging\" field checked.Now you can plug the tablet into your computer USB port and the tablet should show as a separate device in Windows File Explorer (or file manager of other O/S). Mine is labeled \"K00L\". You can open either the tablet file folder and files listed or the folders and files of the SD card in the tablet. I can thus copy and move my music, picture, and document files that I want on the SD card. A bit more work, but no worse that working with iTunes was for me. Oddly, Windows 8.1 does not seem to mount the tablet like a regular USB stick or SD card. At least for me, there is no Eject option for the tablet.My apps will still always be on the main tablet storage, but with almost 10 gB still available, I won't ever run out of space so long as I put personal stuff on the SD card.

I hesitated ordering it for a week because I wanted a Galaxy Tab 3, but couldn't afford the $299 price tag, especially with a good SD card and case. This tablet showed the most promise and I did my research to ensure that I wasn't making a mistake. I ordered with confidence, but still had questions. The biggest question was storage space. I wanted something that I could carry around a large number of PDFs, pictures, videos, mp3s, and still be able to download some of my favorite apps, including some games that have large downloads involved. I attached a 64gb SD card that is a class 10 by Sandisk. It's ultrafast, working well with the tablet, but Asus doesn't permit transferring apps to the SD card. However, the 16GB storage does give me tons of room for things and I'm still about 2GB away from space becoming an issue for apps on the device. I keep everything else on the SD card. I do have to say that 64gb is a far cry from what I technically needed, but I'd rather be safe than sorry a year or two from now.The pros to this tablet are the processor speeds and ability to handle multiple items at once, the screen, the sound, the battery life, and the included stand (I nearly threw it away, now, I use it daily). I had some difficulties connecting it to a PC for file transfer with a cable, but that somehow resolved itself within a day (I am still researching how).The cons are the speaker being in the back, but that's normal for many of these, the inability to transfer the apps to SD, and the bug with the PC connection. The battery is solid, but extensive use of the graphics, even with the battery saver set to on will obviously drain the battery, but I have yet to run it out of power before I can slip it on a usb port of a pc, a car charger, or a wall socket.Definitely get the Square Trade Protection plan. I've read it is outstanding and although I only bought a year of it, initially, I've heard that you can upgrade it to a longer term prior to the end of the first 30 days of ordering it. This needs verified.All in all, I'm very happy, but can't give it 5 stars without the SD card transfer ability, which some people may require.", "Date": "March 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "excellent", "Author": "Nichole Laterza", "ReviewID": "R1T7Y5BYWZCYE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i love this, so much better then the kindle.
