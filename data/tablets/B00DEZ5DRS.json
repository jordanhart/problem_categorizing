{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 - What A Superb Tablet! Just The Right Size!", "Author": "Daisy S \"Daisy S\"", "ReviewID": "R389582PNFZUTD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Updated Review - June 8, 2014 (after close to ONE YEAR of ownership): So I have found that this tablet CONTINUES to exceed all of my expectations and more! If you are looking a high quality eight inch tablet, this may very well be the once for you as the superb improvements in this Tab 3 8.0 over the older Tab 2 7.0 are just fantastic with more internal RAM Memory and more internal storage (double) and this is just a couple of improvements as there are MANY improvements in the Tab 3 8.0 that has truly has given this tablet that WOW Factor.  So below, I am listing the many Pros I personally have found while using this tablet:PROS:+ Overall Speed And Performance and Android OS:With the fast 1.5 GHz processor, I have found this to be a very fast tablet and for me, all has been running so smoothly on this tablet. Love that this tablet has 16GB Internal memory.The Android OS is 4.2 and inside it has Samsung TouchWiz overlay which is beautiful and user friendly. In fact, if you have used a Samsung Galaxy device as S2, S3, S4 or other Galaxy type, you will love the OS and the Samsung TouchWiz interface on this. Perhaps you have never used Android OS or even a Samsung device? No worries, as this tablet is easy to learn in my opinion.+ SCREEN SIZE IS JUST RIGHT SIZE - VERY CLEAR/SHARP SCREEN FOR READING eBooks or VIEWING WEBPAGES. (Screen in my opinion is large and has superb clarity/clearness for reading eBooks and webpages as the print is so readable as I find it VERY CLEAR/VIVID. This is a great in-between size tablet to use. And I found that the screen was large enough to read webpages easily or watch videos. The screen has a PPI (pixels per inch) of 189, which renders a crisp and clear screen. **There is a new selection under Settings and Display, under Font, an option to Increase legibility of fonts. I check marked this and noticed that the fonts/letters on the screen, internet and more are very crystal clear. Also, there is in Settings/Display - Screen Mode, with choices of Dynamic, Standard and Movie. And I selected Dynamic and found that the colors are super vivid and very colorful.+ EXTERNAL SLOT FOR MICRO SD CARD - It is said that you can add a 64gb SD card for personal files. In my case, I have a 32GB SD card and still have plenty of room after my songs, files and photos are added. (A 64 GB card has different formatting and I have not used this size, just the 32GB) About SD Cards: Keep in mind where External SD cards are concerned: They are JUST for your personal files: music, videos, photos, and other files. When you install apps from the Playstore or other sources, they store either in INTERNAL SD Card area or the main internal area. This is the law of the land where Android is concerned and ALL newer Android devices (including Samsung) work this way where storing your downloaded apps are concerned.+ WiFi Connecting/Speed of WiFi - Setting up WiFi and keeping a great signal and long distance WiFi strong signal is one superb feature on this tablet. So I compared the signal strength with the Tab 3 vs my regular Android phone. The Tab 3 had about 35% stronger signal then the phone. I believe it is because there is a very strong WiFi receiver in this tablet. At home or on the road, I am able to connect to many free WiFi hotspots very easily with great signal strength.****Do you need to know how to get on the internet when you are out of a WiFi range? Ask me about this as I have written an article on how to do this using a MiFi type of service from different service providers (please ask in the comment section for more info).+ Internet/Watching Online Flash Videos: After I installed Adobe Archived Flash I can watch internet (flash) videos directly.Because this is archived flash it does take a little longer to load flash videos. If you need instructions on how to do this, please ask in the comments and I will answer this or any questions.*Viewing of webpages in browsers on this tablet: Reading/viewing a webpage is OUTSTANDING using this tablet as the fonts, pictures and videos are very crisp and clear as well as the colors are very vivid.+ Reading/Creating/Editing Word, Excel, Text Files and much more on this tablet: This comes with a OK app for reading Office documents, however, I prefer Kingsoft Office which is a free app from Playstore. It is the best I have ever tried and I am very picky about so called Office programs. It is very compatible with MS Office as it reads, edits and creates Office files and reads PDF files, and it has more features of any other Android Office program that I tried. This app is a MUST have for tablet owners in my opinion.+ Home Videos - The stock video player is OK and plays MOST home videos, however, may I suggest QQ Player, this is a free App from Playstore and it plays every home video I tried). Also MX Video Player is very good, however, I prefer QQ Player.+ Music Player/Sound Quality - Stock player has clear sound through the outside \"speakers\" are really OK. Better with good quality headphones or a BlueTooth Speaker. To sync easily with Windows Media Player may I suggest the Playstore app free called WinAmp for the tablet as it is very highly rated and the sound is SUPERB!+ Battery Life- Excellent, so far, however, this is what I have found: When I am on WiFi, I go to the websites I need and then as soon as I am done (reasonable time), I exit the browser (or YouTube, etc) and TURN OFF WiFi. However, I run my brightness at 100%. So this seems to keep the battery going longer. *In addition, I have found that my battery life is improved over the Tab 2 7.0 and the Tab 2 10.1.+ Kindle App - I installed the Kindle App and synced my Kindle books. Began to read a new book and was very impressed with how exceptional the book rendered using this Tab 3 8.0. Very impressed as the text was very crisp and clear.+ Camera - The 5MP rear camera on this Tab 3 8.0 has improved over the Tab 2 line. There is no flash on the camera, yet there are several helpful modes to enhance your shots. For me, I use Auto mode. And I tried the camera and video and was happily surprised in the quality - it is pretty good. However, I will continue to use my regular camera for serious picture taking and videos.+ OTG USB Compatible - You can add an optional OTG (On the Go Micro USB adapter cable to the Micro port for copying files to your flash drive and from your flash drive to the Tab 3). I already had one from my Note I and it works great on the Tab. You can also plug in a mouse, I tried it and it worked. *Note that portable external hard drives and portable DVD/CD drives will not work using OTG in the Tab 3 as I discovered when I tried to read my hard disks via OTG in the Tab 3. However, it is still good to know that you can easily plug in your flash drive and copy files to the Tab 3 and from Tab 3 to PC--what a time-saver.+ Bluetooth Speed and Performance - The Bluetooth paired quickly with several devices as well as Bluetooth keyboards, Bluetooth Stereo Headsets, Bluetooth speakers (all I tried) and copied files at a great rate of speed. SUPERB and FAST Bluetooth.+ Screenshots: There is no ICON for screenshots, however, to take a quick screenshot, hold down home button and power button (at the same time), and then it will take a beautiful screenshot. You can find your screenshot in MyFiles, Internal Storage, Pictures, and Screenshots. I use this sometimes for a map on the internet it saves time and this way it is SAVED for later viewing when I am offline.+ MICRO USB PORT - No more having to use the old type of (non standard) USB charger/cable that the Tab 2 line had. However, this tablet requires a 2 AMP USB Charger to charge the tablet so it will not charge on a standard 1 AMP (phone charger) as I tried and only the 2 AMP one will work. This tablet uses the same Micro 2 AMP type of chargers that the Galaxy Note 8 uses.CON (Just ONE however, NOT the fault of Samsung):- Just one con/concern: New Adobe Flash is not supported, however, I found that archived flash gets the online videos to play and they even play in the stock browser. So I downloaded the older archived flash which gives me the ability to view many internet videos. If you need instructions, just ask me in the comments and I will answer.* Bottom line/My Suggestions to You: Would I buy this WiFi only model over again? Yes because this Tab 3 8.0 is lightweight, easy to hold in ONE HAND, and it just as easy to hold as the Tab 3 7 inch, yet has so much more screen real-estate than the Tab 3 7 inch and clarity etc, for just 90 dollars more, this is a MUCH BETTER BUY! And I have found because the screen is so crisp and clear, it reads internet pages CLEARER, Videos are larger and much clearer to see etc. And the 8 inch is so easy to pop into a briefcase, bag or purse etc than say a large 10 inch is...if you travel and want to go light, may I suggest this Tab 3 8.0 to you!Also, since I am somewhat of a techie person, I will be glad to answer any questions that you may have. Just ask in the comment section and I will answer promptly.", "Date": "July 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "I ditched my iPad Mini for a Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 and couldn't be happier!", "Author": "MOAR COARS", "ReviewID": "R1YTRONAD0J95M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So it's been three days since I got my Galaxy Tab 3 8\" (my brother is a manager at BestBuy so I got it early if you are wondering) and before I start my review, I just want to say that I used to own an iPhone 5 but ditched it for a Galaxy S4 and now I'm ditching my iPad Mini for a Galaxy Tab 3 8\". I've literally had enough of Apple products and will not be buying their products any longer. I have become an Android fanboy and literally love all the products that Samsung makes.The Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 has the same look and feel as the Galaxy S4 but it's just bigger which I have no problems with. My brand new Galaxy Tab 3 8\" makes my iPad Mini look like a joke in everything that I have tested so far, from battery life, web browsing to 3D games etc. The Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 comes with the latest version of Android which is Android 4.2.2 (Jelly Bean) and it is liquid smooth. I haven't experienced a single slow down so far and everything seems to open very quickly. It also has a very fast CPU (Mali 400) that runs at 1.5Ghz and handles 3D games like a champ. I have listed some things below that I love about the Tab 3 8.0.These are some of the things that I love about the Galaxy Tab 3 8.0:Pros:+Build Quality / Design:If you are familiar with Samsung's devices and have no problems with their glossy plastic design, then you will love the design of Tab 3 8.0 as well. The Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 has a nice thin bezel that's thinner than its predecessor and also better looking as well. While my iPad mini was made of aluminum, Samsung continues to use the same glossy plastic with their devices and this isn't a bad thing by any means because my Galaxy S4 is plastic as well and I absolutely love it. The Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 is a bit taller than my iPad Mini but also a bit narrower and both of them are extremely light, around 310g.+Web Browsing:The web browsing experience is awesome on the Tab 3 8.0, everything looks sharp and loads quickly. I'm not using the stock browsing app because it lacks many features that I use on a daily basis but instead, I'm using Chrome and Dolphin Browser. I'm also not using the stock Samsung keyboard because it doesn't have the swipe feature that I use quite a lot so I downloaded the official Google keyboard from the Play Store and I love it. I highly recommend you guys try the official Google Keyboard if you want a clean and slick keyboard that's not cluttered with a lot of useless stuff.+Screen/Display:The Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 is the perfect size for me because tablets that are usually 7 inches are too small (I have large hands btw) and tablets that are over 9 inches are sort of big and this makes the Tab 3 8.0 the sweet spot for me. The Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 has a nice 8 inches screen that makes everything looks sharp with vivid colors when watching HD videos or playing games. The colors and viewing angles are fantastic, I have absolutely no complaints. The screen resolution and ppi is also much higher on the Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 (1280x800, 189ppi) than the iPad mini (1024x768, 162ppi) so this makes everything look sharper on the Tab 3 8.0.  The iPad Mini has an aspect ratio of 4:3 while my Tab 3 8.0 has an aspect ratio of 16:10.+Android OS:It ships with the most up to date version of Android, Android 4.2.2 (Jelly Bean) which is the fastest Android version yet. Everything is liquid smooth, from web browsing, watching HD videos, recording videos and playing intensive 3D games. Samsung has added many new features to TouchWiz which is great but I'm not really a fan of TouchWiz. I usually just disable all the things that I don't use to improve the performance of the tablet and the battery life. I just wish Google would force all these manufactures to use stock Android OS instead of coming with pre-installed bloatware and whatnot that slows the tablet down and kills the battery life.+Camera:The rear camera on the Tab 3 8.0 is 5MP (2592x1944 pixels) and the front camera is 1.3MP. It can only take 720p videos which is more than acceptable for me but it would have been better if it had an 8MP camera and took 1080p videos. My iPad mini was able to take 1080p videos @30fps and I just wish I had that option with the Tab 3 8.0. There's nothing wrong with 720p and 5MP camera because it takes great pictures and videos and this is not really a deal breaker for me.+Battery:The battery on the Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 is 4450 mAh which is more than enough to last a full day (brightness turned down a bit) with a single charge if you watch YouTube videos, web browsing, picture taking or even watch HD movies for that matter. I can get through the day with a single charge and still have 10% left at the end of the day. My brightness is currently set at 40% and it's perfectly visible both indoors and outdoors. The battery life is one of the most important aspects when deciding which tablet to buy for me because I travel a lot and I need a tablet that can last the entire day.+Storage:With the option of an external sdcard, the Tab 3 8.0 supports an sdcard of up to 64GB. If you are someone who wants that amount of space on their tablet than you have that option with the Tab 3 8.0. I can store as many pictures, music, games and HD videos as I want and it will never come close to being full. I am the type of person who stores large collections of pictures, music, videos, and movies and the Tab 3 8.0 lets me do all of that easily. I also play 3D games that require a minimum of 2-3GB of space and this tablet is perfect for that. It comes with 16GB of storage (11.2GB usable) which is plenty for taking a ton of pictures/videos, installing large 3D games and whatnot.  It also comes with 1.5GB of ram which is three times as more as my iPad Mini (512MB). I hated the lag that I would get when running out of ram on my iPad mini but now I don't have that problem with my new Tab 3 8.0.+Processor:The Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 comes with ARM Mali-400 which is a dual core CPU that runs at 1.5Ghz and it has no problems handling everything you throw at it, from 3D games to HD videos. The tablet comes with a ton of bloatware as always and I always try to disable most of it because it can really waste precious battery life and slow down the tablet. I rarely ever use all the features that Samsung provides so I just disable it. The Mali-400 has no problems playing games such GTA Vice City on the highest settings and that says a lot about the performance of the CPU. Multi-tasking is fantastic on the Tab 3 8.0 because it has a ton of ram and a fast CPU to handle all your apps running in the background if you need to.Cons:-Not 1080p display:I just wish Samsung would have upgraded the display to 1080p since that's the standard nowadays but oh well, I'm perfectly fine with what I have. That's the only negative that I can think of but it's not a deal breaker for me because it won't make a huge difference to the eyes even if it had a 1080p screen.Conclusion:Overall, the Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 is the perfect tablet for people who want a mid-range device with amazing specs that's not too small and not too big but somewhere in between. The Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 fills the sweet spot for me and the fact that it lasts a full day with the brightness turned day a bit is great for me. I can get all of my work done when traveling without having to constantly charge the device. It also comes with a fast CPU, Mali-400 that runs at 1.5Ghz and has a ton of ram, 1.5GB. I was a little disappointed that it didn't come with a 1080p screen but it's not the end of the world because it still delivers an amazing web browsing experience, watching HD videos, battery life and playing 3D games. The iPad Mini is $349.99 while the Tab 3 8.0 is only $299.00 and it's still faster and better overall. I highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 to anyone who want the best mid-range tablet on the market!I hope this was helpful and I will update my review once I do more tests. If you guys have a question about the tablet then just leave a comment and I will respond.", "Date": "July 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "The BEST of Galaxy Tab 3 series.", "Author": "rpv", "ReviewID": "R1EDJ05MCF3Z5C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There are too many tablets these days, right?! Samsung's third generation of Galaxy Tab series is highly anticipated and for this price point phenomenal. I have been using Galaxy Tab 2 and I will compare and contrast here. I played around with review units of all sizes and I have since returned them. I liked the Tab 8 so much, I purchased 2 for myself and my family. My reviews are unbiased and neutral! 7 and 8\" are ideal for plane trips, long journeys. I had used a 7\" Tablet on a long journey to listen to songs and read epub books (Aldiko) and it was a very pleasant experience. 7\" form factor is lightweight, compact and great. If you are a bit experienced and can afford it, I recommend the 8\". Samsung has made 8\" and 7\" almost same weight. In my opinion 8\" is the maximum value for the money and features and hence I gave 8\" a 5 star. I am personally getting the 8\" version. I gave 7\" a 4 star (but no means undermining it). I gave the 10\" also a 4 star because of some strange feature `limitations'.Samsung has introduced 7\", 8\" and 10.1\" of the Tab 3 series. They are entering all form factors. As I know they have something in 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10\" lines. Woo.. All of the 7, 8, 10\" Galaxy Tabs come in white and golden brown color. My preference is white color. Looks pretty!Let's start off with salient points of all of the Galaxy Tab 3 series. In previous version of Tab 2, there was simply no 8\" form factor. So I will compare with Note 8 later.7-inch tablet: 1024 x 600, Marvell dual-core 1.2GHz processor, 1GB RAM and 8GB storage or ROM, a microSD card slot (upto 64 GB), Camera: 3MP rear-facing, 1.3MP front-facing and weighs 10.58 ounces (300 grams). Android 4.1.28-inch model: 1280 x 800, Exynos 1.5GHz dual-core processor, 1.5GB ram, 16GB of built-in storage (ROM), a microSD slot (upto 64 GB, 5MP rear-facing, 1.3MP front-facing and 10.9 ounce (309 grams) Android 4.2.10.1-inch model: 1280 x 800,  Intel Atom 1.6GHz Z2560 dual-core processor, 1GB RAM, a 16GB built-in storage (ROM), a microSD slot, 3.2MP rear-facing, 1.3MP front-facing and weighs 17.99 oz (510 grams). Android 4.2I am not going into other details like accelerometer etc as they are all standard these days, Audio support - AAC, AMR, MP3, OGG, WMA/ASF, 3GA/M4A, FLAC, WAV; MP3/MP4/Music Tones; Music Player; Ringtones, Polyphonic. Video support: AVI/DIVX, WMV/ASF, FLV, MKV, MP4/3GP, WEBM; Video Player; Video Streaming. Software is current of release date, and it is expected could be upgraded as next version Android 5 Key Lime Pie. (Currently targeted for Oct 2013). Key Lime Pie's one of the main touting points is compatibility to avoid fragmentation, so I can foresee, all of these models being able to upgrade if Google keeps their promise.The 8\" has a physical home button so are others in the series.  Also has capacitive Back and Menu buttons. 64 GB SD card is awesome! With prices plummeting for 64 GB cards, it is a great boon. Put all your music, books, photos on the SD card and you have a powerful computer in hand always! I personally use the 64 GB microSD card on my mobile devices. Get this mobileUltra (SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 6 Memory Card with SD Adapter - Retail Packaging.Best thing about Tab 3 8.0 is how holdable it is. It's narrower than the Galaxy Note 8.0. But in every other way, including lightness, comfortable curves, and screen brightness, it feels the same. There is a $100 prices difference between Tab 3 7\" and Tab 3 8\". If that matters get a Tab 3 7in. Otherwise 8\" is more portable and lightweight compared to 10\". The Galaxy Note 2 as well as iPad Mini are same form factors as this one.  There are other reasons to pick the 8-incher over the 7.0. The larger Tab 3 gets Android 4.2 instead of 4.1, 1280 x 800 resolution, twice as much (16GB) internal storage, and 1.5GB of RAM.The comparison with 8\" Note are: Note 8 is slightly heavier 338 grams compared to 309 grams of Tab 8. Each gram matters for long holding.  From CPU processor perspective, Note has a Quad-core 1.6 GHz Cortex-A9  Versus  dual-core 1.5 GHz  of Tab 2 8\". Resolution same on both 1280 x 800 pixels, 8.0 inches (~189 ppi pixel density). The Tab has - Dolby Surround sound enhancement,  it does sound good! The Note has no such mention and I am sure does not have dolby enhancement. Note 8 has 2 GB RAM compared to 1.5 GB here. Both have Bluetooth 4.0\" and have USB Host capability. USB Host is one of the most under noticed features of Androids and is in my opinion one of the best features compared to iPad lines. What this means you get a USB Host cable also otherwise called OTG (On the Go) cables and plug in your USB thumb drive or other USB devices and the device recognizes it. I have used it with Alfa AWUS036H for a wireless project with Android PCAP Capture from reputable Kismet wireless. Both have same camera 5 MP, 2560\u04451920 pixels, and 720p@30fps.  Another much ignored feature is the TV-out (via MHL A/V link). 8 and 10.1in supports it, whereas 7in does not. You can connect Galaxy devices to a TV to make it truly a fantastic computer if MHL is supported. Throw in a Bluetooth keyboard and it is awesome. Leo Laporte's TwIT TV which is Internet based show has one full episode in Know How on covering this topic. Battery on Note 8 is slightly bigger Non-removable Li-Ion 4600 mAh battery than 4450 mAh on Tab 3 which is not a big difference.Believe me, don't get mired in the spec game. Samsung is creating markets for all form factors and I would consider this as an exploratory stage. Just like Ford or Toyota has cars in different shapes, sizes and price range, so are the tablet vendors now. Remember the laptop wars, 10\", 12\" 13\", 15, 17 and even some 19\" if I remember right few years ago. We used to debate endlessly which laptop sizes are better, which has better speakers and so on. The time has come to fight it out for tablets! I would say go from budget and size. If budget is not a concern, I would say go for Samsung Tab 8. I am usually not a big fan of 10\". 8\" is a sweet spot. If budget is a concern, Tab 3 7\" is awesome, otherwise get the Tab 8. 10\" is marketed for specific segments in business who use for spreadsheets, presentations, remote desktop like Citrix GoToMeeting. GPS was spot on and I tried multiple GPS apps. It was bright outdoors (had to crank the brightness all the way up). I personally use Navigon from Garmin and have downloaded several apps.I tried following apps and they just worked awesome. A tablet is only as good as the apps you have how productive it makes you. It's almost like the camera/lens analogy in the DSLR space. What good it is to have a great DSLR body if you have no good lens? Same with Tablet body and apps you have.WolframAlpha (I can go on for hours praising this. This is a truly genius app powered by hundreds of supercomputers in the background. Wolfram is a computational genius). Well worth the $3 price.Withings HealthMate. (another remarkable app great UI/UX). I am getting the Pulse device as soon as it hit stores.

It is reasonably fast, but it is still IMO a slight bit overpriced for it's specs.UPDATE 27 Nov 2013:The price of the Samsung Tab 3 8 has recently dropped to 249 dollars.  At this price, it is more competitive.  Asus has recently released the ASUS ME180, an 8 inch tablet with a quad core processor, micro sd card slot, and front and back cameras.  The Asus is selling for 229 dollars and is a worthy competitor.  Based on my experiences with Asus and Samsung, I would rate these two tablets neck and neck for features.  I rate the Samsung ever so slightly better for overall build quality, however, build quality can vary greatly among tablets.  The Samsung also feels a bit more comfortable in the hand.  Unless you have a brand preference or prefer one over the other because of design or ergonomics, either of these two tablets are very good.UPDATE 3 Dec 2013:  The Dell Venue 8 is a pure android tablet.  It has been selling for $179.00 and even as much as 20 to 50 dollars less on sale.  It runs on an atom (dual core) chip and has 2gb of memory and 16gb of storage.  It looks like a good budget tablet but still offers reasonable quality and a one year warranty.  Dell tends to be much better at honoring their warranties and at customer service than any of the other tablet makers other than Apple.  The display is 1280 x 800.  The most significant complaint about the tablet appears to be the touch screen sensitivity not being very good or at times unresponsive.  It also has an micro sd slot and camera.UPDATE 10 Dec 2013:  The ASUS MeMO 8 tablet has dropped to 199 dollars.  Unless you have a brand preference for Samsung, need the TV remote control features, or have a preference for the lightest tablet possible, then you may want to seriously consider the Asus MeMO 8 or the Dell Venue 8 as less costly alternatives to the Samsung Tab 3 8.  The Tab 3 8 is still selling at a premium ($249) to the cost of the Asus Memo 8 ($199) and the Dell Venue 8 ($179).In the 8 inch tablet category there is now the following tablets in the order of my overall judgment of their desirability (see specs at the end of each for comparison purposes):Samsung Tab 3 8 - at 249.00, this is still a bit costly, but it is light, responsive and has a good screen. Probably has a slight edge on reliability over the others.Specs: 1.5 GHz Samsung Exynos 4210 Dual Core processor, 1.5 GB DDR2 SDRAM memory, 1280 X 800 resolution, Mali 400 GPU, .68 poundsAsus Memo 8 - at 199.00, the ASUS MeMO 8 is the best value in price vs. performance for the 8\" tablet market.  Samsung is placing itself as a premium tablet while the Asus Memo 8 is priced as a good quality tablet at a reasonable price.Specs: AMD Quad Core 1.6GHz processor, 1 GB DDR3L SDRAM memory, 1280 X 800 resolution, Mali 400 MP4 graphics, .8 poundsDell Venue 8 - at prices ranging from 129.00 to 179.00 for the 16GB tablet, it is definitely worth a look. Dell tends to be good on customer service and this tablet has 2GB of DDR memory which is definitely a plus. One review commented on the lack of response for the touch screen, however reviews on Dell's site have been positive. The Dell Venue 8 runs true android. If you can get a branded 8\" pure android tablet for the $129 Black Friday sale price, the deal is hard to pass up.  Note: As of 12/19/2013, Dell has released an update so that multiple user profiles can be used on the Venue 8.Specs: Intel Atom Z2580(up to 2.0GHZ)Dual Core processor, 2GB DDR2 memory, 1280 X 800 resolution, Intel HD Graphics, .82 poundsAcer Iconia A1-810 - gets some good reviews and sells for about 170.00. It is kind of heavy at 1.01 pounds (If Amazon's specs are correct). It also has a lower resolution than the other tablets.  With the release of the Asus MeMO 8 and the Dell Venue 8, this tablet is trailing the others by a bit.  Amazon shows a few complaints about the customer service.  The Acer A1-810 was on sale for as low as 149 dollars recently.Specs: Acer MTK MT8125 1.2 Ghz Quad Core processor, 1 GB DDR3L SDRAM, 1024 X 768 resolution, Integrated PowerVR SGX 544 Graphics, 1.01 pounds (website says 14.46 ounces or approximately .9 pounds)Happy shopping!", "Date": "September 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Simply a Great Product", "Author": "JL", "ReviewID": "R3KLRHWHXD07L7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'd like to preface my review by saying that I've always had an affinity for Samsung products. I've owned the original Galaxy tab 10.1, Samsung Series 9 ultrabook,  Galaxy s3, Note 2, and the Nexus 10 tablet. But for those that may simply dismiss me as a fanboy, that's not to take away from my enthusiasm towards tech in general - I own a 15' Retina macbook pro, Ipad 4, Vaio Pro 13, and have had a myriad of other products along the way which I have thoroughly enjoyed. If it works well and fits my needs, I will get it.I like to appreciate each product for what it truly is: the value and usefulness it can provide me. This Galaxy tab 3 8 is as good as any tablet out there on the market today.Size and Build Quality:In my opinion, 8 inches is the perfect size for tablets. 7 feels a little cramped, and isn't the best for reading books or watching media on. 10 inches is great if you're always at home, but not so much if you're on the go or traveling. The 8 feels like that perfect equilibrium between the two that combines screen usability, with portability.Build quality? What can I say, it's typical Samsung. It's not made of crazy precious metals and rare materials; nor should you expect it to be. However, it's sturdy, light, durable, and doesn't have any flex or creaking when held. It's also extremely light so you won't even feel the difference in weight when you throw this thing in your backpack or bag. You can also easily hold it in your hands without having to use a brace for hours without fatigue or discomfort. The Gold Brown color looks luxurious to me and is a unique offering by Samsung.Display:Is it a 300+ PPI, top-of-the-line incredible monster display? No. Does it pack enough pixels to rival retina displays? No. Does it really make a difference? Well, I can honestly say in terms of actual everyday use and color reproduction, no it does not make a difference.Side by side to a Retina Ipad 4, I watched 1080p videos of a wide variety ranging from Nature, Cars, Sports, Music Videos, you name it. The Galaxy Tab 8 easily held its own, and you'd be hard pressed to notice enough of a difference between the 2 displays to really complain or nitpick at all. I'd venture as far as to say that the color looked even better on certain videos on the Tab 8, but I don't want to start another online feud with Apple loyalists so I'll stop right here.The 1280 x 800 display is plenty for a tab of this size, and for comparison is a higher resolution than the iPad Mini.For games, movies, pictures and browsing, it's a perfectly fine display. The only thing I will say, is that text is more crisp, clear and sharp on the Ipad and Nexus 10. If you're not used to those displays, you'll have no complaints with the display on the Tab 8. Nor does the difference make reading/browsing difficult or straining by ANY means. Simply put, the displays on those other 2 devices are out of this world, and you shouldn't expect this tablet in this price range to match that offering.Functionality:TouchWiz: Most people hate it or love it. I've tolerated it in the past, but have grown to appreciate its added features over the years. It's not as cartoon-y or bloated as in the past. TW on this tab is fast, responsive, and offers some nice features you won't get on Nexus devices or other brands. All I can say is, try it for yourself. They've made it easy to use and it doesn't interfere or get in the way of the Android experience in my opinion.If you hate it, you can install Nova or other launchers and customize your look and layout from there.Processor: The Dual core exynos and 1.5 gb ram should be plenty for 90% of users out there.I don't play too many games on tablets so I'll let some of the other reviews answer those questions. But I played Candy Crush, Baseball Superstars 2k13, and a few others for test, and they all played smooth and fast. Note that the referenced games aren't the most graphically demanding or intense.For normal tasks such as browsing, media, email, video chatting? You've got plenty of power, don't worry.The Tab 8 comes with Polaris Office which is great as it offers a comparable experience to the Office Suite of products on your tablet. You're not going to be writing a novel on this thing, nor are you going to open up 40,000 line spreadsheets and perform data analysis. However, for touching up documents on the go here and there, it's a perfectly fine alternative solution.IR blaster: Samsung gave us this nifty feature along with the SmartOn remote app. It hooked up to my LGTV and Comcast set top box within seconds, and I was able to control almost every function of my Home entertainment system from my tablet. It's great to see a large colorful TV guide, and I appreciate and enjoy this feature. If you don't like it, you don't have to use it.Camera: Adequate. I myself don't take photos with a tablet. If you do, this will work for things like taking a quick food pic or family pic. It won't blow your shoes off, but you probably shouldn't be expecting a tablet camera to do that.Speakers: Blah. They're both positioned at the bottom which is not ideal, especially in Landscape mode. The volume levels are decent but nothing to write home about. I wish Samsung stuck with the 2 stereo front facing speakers of the 10.1 2 and Nexus 10. Easy fix? Use earphones.Micro SD Card: Oh, the feature that so many users covet, but so few manufacturers actually provide. HTC, Apple, and Nexus devices all fail to grasp the importance of this functionality. Samsung provides this so you can store your music, photos, books, documents, and movies when you need that extra storage space.There's not too much else that will be a different experience from other Android tab offerings. Apps such as Kindle, Amazon, Netflix, Flipboard, etc are all what you'd expect and work great.If apps, more specifically tablet optimized apps are important to you, then perhaps an Android tablet still isn't the right choice for you. Apple still has far more tablet optimized Apps than the Play Store. However, with the advances already made over the past few iterations of Android, and the rising popularity of tablets in general, I think developers will see the value for providing tablet optimized Apps for Android going forward.Lastly, price: at $299, the value of this product is really hard to beat. It's in the price range to appeal to a wide base of users' budgets, and backs it up with great functionality, features, and design. I'd recommend to any of my friends and family.", "Date": "July 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung nailed it in the 8\" category.", "Author": "B. Nelson", "ReviewID": "R2W0UFSP37LTF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this tablet on release day at Best Buy. This tablet is the perfect blend of portability with a big enough screen to comfortably web browse. It is lightweight and the slim side bezels allow me to grip it with one hand. It is designed with portrait orientation being it's preferred position which is the way I find myself holding it 90% of the time anyways unless watching videos.The inclusion of hard buttons makes the most of the screen real estate, but take some getting use to if you come from non-Samsung android devices as myself.  This device has become my favorite android device that I use on a daily basis. It fits in cargo pants/shorts pockets. I also have an HP Touchpad running android that I never use that much due to its weight and size. I use this to read books, web browse, listen to music, and watch videos.  I am a tech junkie. I have also been involved with android since its first device, the original Motorola Droid. I want to highlight some of the features of this tablet that make it stand out from the rest of the pack. I also want to correct misleading and sometimes incorrect information presented in other reviews.-Hardware-Unfortunately, Samsung chose to skimp a little on specs of this device. I'm sure it was because of the cost of the 8\" screen and yet trying to keep the overall cost cheaper than Samsung's premium line Note 8.0. If you are one that is dead set on using specs,i.e. processor, ram, resolution, as the main determining factor, this tablet will not stand out amongst competitors. What will stand out is the 8\" screen. This tablet is using the same screen as the Note 8.0. I find it sharp with natural colors and not over-saturated. Photos and videos look excellent.Samsung includes a microSD slot that can use cards up to 64GB. This can hold music, documents, and videos.This model also comes with a forward and rear camera. The forward camera can be used with Skype and Google Hangouts and is also used in one of Samsung's software enhancements that I will touch on in a minute.As you can see, nothing pops out from a hardware standpoint except it's form factor, 8\" screen, and microSD slot. It also has an InfraRed blaster built-in for controlling A/V equipment. I wanted to add that while this tablet may not be using top of the line specs, it does not suffer in the least bit from its exclusion. I have not experienced any lag or long delay.-Software-This is where Samsung shines. It has some innovative features that enhance the tablet experience and brought back a much requested feature that was included in past versions of android.Multi-window - This allows more than one app to be open at the same time. This is a feature I don't use that much, but I find it nice if someone emails me to setup an appointment. I can have the calendar app and email app open at the same time to input the time/place from the email into the calendar. The multi-window feature does not work with all apps, only the ones pre-selected in the scrollable list which is understandably geared toward productivity.Smart Screen - This is a feature that uses the front camera to look at your eyes. This is a great feature when web browsing. It keeps the screen lit as long as you are looking at the tablet. When you look away, it allows the screen to timeout. I find this feature does not work well when reclined because it does not detect my eyes. This is due to the angle I am looking at the tablet with my eyes half closed. It also does not work well in landscape orientation most likely due to the camera being on the left edge in that position.Move apps to SD - This is a feature that was available in past versions of android. Google removed this feature in all current builds. Samsung reintroduced this feature in their tweaked version of Jellybean 4.2.2. This allows you to move compatible apps to your microSD which help frees up precious internal storage. Keep in mind, this does not work with all apps. It is up to developers of the apps to allow this feature. I tested this with Angry Birds, Netflix, Kindle. They all successfully moved to my microSD and ran flawlessly. Tip: You may have to format your microSD with the tablet instead of a PC for this feature to work.Miracast/Screen Mirroring - This device is Miracast certified. This allows you to wirelessly mirror the tablet's screen to your TV. For this to work you need a Miracast certified TV. Sony, Samsung, and LG all make Miracast certified TVs. You can also use a Miracast certified dongle that attaches to an HDMI input on your TV. This is the only small portable tablet that currently has this feature besides the Note 8.0. Even Samsung's new Tab 3 7\" does not have this feature.Bluetooth v4.0 with aptX codec support - I had to dig to find that this tablet supports aptX codec. This is a huge improvement in sound quality via bluetooth. To use this, you also need bluetooth headphones that support aptX or an bluetooth dongle for your home stereo that supports aptX. Not all new devices support this, but I have found that Motorola and Samsung both have been including this in their newer products.Polaris Office - This tablet ships with Polaris Office installed. This lets you edit, create, and view Microsoft Office documents, spreadsheets, and powerpoint presentations. Some tablets and phones only come with a version that lets you view the files while Samsung included a full version with this tablet.-Conclusion-This tablet is selling with mid-range specs, but a high-end user experience. It comes with Samsung's optimized version of android Jellybean 4.2.2. The only notable feature missing from this tablet is NFC which would have come in handy for the Miracast feature. Overall, this tablet comes packed with features not available on any other tablet in this price range or form factor. This is the first android device that I haven't wanted to root right away to gain more functions and abilities.", "Date": "July 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Highly Recommended", "Author": "walt \"kromerser\"", "ReviewID": "R2YW625L8935MB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't write reviews, but this tablet deserves a 5 star because of its functionality and user friendliness.I'm not an tech expert by any means, but this product is pretty easy to use and the main apps and basic functions are mostly self explanatory.With that in mind, if you are in the middle of the fence, like I was a few weeks ago trying to decide  between buying a kindle HD or a Nexus 7, I recommend you to pick up a Samsung instead, preferably this model instead the 7\" because of its better features.I have friends who have Kindle and Nexus tablets, but this one blows them out of the park mostly because you can add an external memory card and have your music and family photos loaded on the card instead of going through an online storage service like \"cloud\", the remote control app and and included charger which the kindle doesn't include.This tablet holds a charge with no problem.Again, i'm not a tech expert, so please don't bash me, but as i mentioned from the get go this tablet is great for a person who wants to browse the web, watch videos on you tube, use skype, to watch shows on netflix of hulu plus and to play games and listen to music.You just can't go wrong with it.

Hindman \"Dougiebaby\"", "ReviewID": "R3MRQQV6D18HYW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "On November 1st, 2013 I purchased the new iPad Air and really enjoyed it.  However, I did not like the 10\" form factor and returned the unit.  Luckily, I was able to purchase the new iPad Mini with Retina display on its first day launch at the Apple Store on November 15th.  I was able to spend a good deal of time with this unit since it was in the \"holiday season\" and I was able to return it on January 6th.To be honest, I absolutely loved both Apple products but it was somewhat of a hollow feeling as I really felt like I paid too much vs. the competition.  I don't mind paying a premium price for a premium product, but the iPads are no longer the only premium products in this space.So, after almost 2 months with the Mini I purchased this Samsung Tab 3 8\".  Technically, it does not match the impressive spec sheet of the Mini with Retina.  But in real world performance (viewing videos, surfing the web, running applications, running games - from Candy Crush Saga to Asphalt 8, reading e-books and Flipboard magazines, etc.) there is actually no noticeable performance differences between this and the Mini with Retina with the exception that the Mini seemed to hold its charge a bit longer (about 1 extra hour).Oddly, the Mini would stutter when I scrolled in the Facebook app whereas the Samsung does not.  Another odd thing about the Mini would be it would start Netflix videos in Standard Def then about a minute or two in switch to High Def.I don't mean to bash the Mini as it is a great product.  But I don't think it is worth 160 dollars more than this Samsung (I purchased mine at Costco for 239 vs. the 399 Mini).On to the Samsung Tab 3 8\"...The 16:9 aspect ratio screen is perfect for watching videos.  The screen is brilliant and stunning to look at ... more brilliant than the Mini even though the Mini has a higher resolution screen.The camera has many more features and shooting modes than the Mini.  The Mini does shoot video in 1080p vs. Samsung's 720p.  Oddly enough, I actually prefer shooting video in 720p as it is still HD but the files are much smaller and easier to process on my MacBook Pro (using iMovie).Another fantastic feature about this Sammy is that you can upgrade storage using micro SD cards.  I purchased one, here on Amazon (http://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-MicroSDHC-Memory-Adapter-SDSDQU-032G-AFFP-/dp/B009QZH7BU/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1391452164&sr;=1-1&keywords;=sandisk+ultra+32+gb), for 22 bucks - thus, increasing storage to 48 GB (16GB standard + 32GB card).  Apple charges $100 to upgrade Mini from 16GB to 32GB.Another interesting thing is that the same apps on this device take up less space than on the Mini.  For example, the Facebook app on this is 44MB vs. over 300MB on the Mini.  Also, Asphalt 8 is only 27MB on this vs. 1.5GB on the Mini.  So, you very quickly use up storage on the Mini vs. this.I love the IR blaster on this tablet and use it to control all of the TV's/satellite in my home -- it's awesome!The \"Cons\" of this tablet are: the back and menu buttons on the bottom can be mistakenly hit when you don't mean to push them ... this can be very frustrating when watching a movie or playing a game, then suddenly the movie/game stops because of an errant back button touch.My only real wish for this tablet is that it lacks (as almost all tablets do) a LED flash for the back camera.  Unlike the popular consensus that \"why should a tablet have a camera anyways?\", I completely disagree.  Sure with a big 10\" tablet it looks odd taking a pic or video, but with a smaller 7-8\" tablet it really is quite nice/easy to frame shots/video and playback of the pics/videos in this larger size (vs. phone) is awesome for all who view it.For the price and performance, I love this tablet.", "Date": "February 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very competitive tablet. Vs google nexus and kindle fire hdx", "Author": "Dominic Bronson", "ReviewID": "R15Z7JMVWXJU6P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So I did my research on tablets. And I found three small tablets that seemed to be the best for the money: the google nexus 7, Kindle fire hdx, and samsung tab 3 8.0.  The first thing that really stood out was the 8\" screen on the samsung. Yeah the nexus 7 has a sharper screen when you look closely but it had both larger bezels and a significantly thicker frame making it feel chunky campared to samsung. The nexus does have a quadcore processor which is clocked at the same speed as the tab 3 8.0. But both are very fast. Otherwise these tablets are similar. They both have plenty of RAM, front and back cameras with HD video shooting, access to google play, and android's jelly bean OS. The samsung tablet felt so thin and sleek in hand. And the nexus' limited you to 32gb of storage, while samsung's tablet allowed you to expand from 16gb all the way to 80gb by adding a 64gb sd card which is now supported by the tab 3 line. This is very helpful if you like to carry your movies around with you. I ruled the kindle fire hdx out for several reasons before but mainly because it restricted you to amazons app store and media supply.  I bought the samsung tab 3 8.0.

I find the screen to be great, very sharp and very responsive, and am not having any issues with rapid discharge - in fact I have been able to go 2+ days on one charge as long as I let the tablet sleep when I am not using it.  I purchased one of the cases that put the tablet in sleep mode when the cover is closed, and this may be hapling with battery life.  So far I have not watched videos much but I have spent lots of time on the internet, listening to music (through earbuds) and on youtube and with multiple apps open at the same time.I often edit documents and photos on the tab and am very happy with its performance. OTG capability is a must for me as I use my tablet as a laptop replacement when I travel and I need to be able to transfer files from SD cards and USB drives. File transfer and uploading/downloading to the internet are all very fast, much faster than my previous android tab, which was a relatively new and very well-rated 10-inch tab from a different manufacturer. I have a Motorola bluetooth keyboard which works beautifully with this Samsung tab (all the keys work properly with no resetting).I am finding the 8-inch size to be perfect for me, just big enough for all the \"work\" I do (file and photo editing) and for watching videos but small enough to be very easily transportable.  It is also a perfect size for reading (eg using the Kindle app), and the tablet has a \"reading mode\" setting that is easily accessible that optimizes the screen for such apps.A few caveats - I use a Samsung Galaxy phone and so am used to the Samsung interface and am a fan of it.  I like the external buttons and I love that my phone and tablet interface so well.  Also, I have small hands so am not bothered by small buttons or form factor.

I have several tablets and about 5% of the apps that I want will not load, saying that the app is not compatible with this device.  100% of the apps I want that won't load on other tablets will load on this one.

It was almost overwhelming, trying to decide which tablet to buy. The deciding factor for me was that I already use a Samsung Galaxy S4 phone, and this tablet is very similar to the phone. The buttons, icons, menu, and apps were all very familiar, so it was very easy to learn how to use the tablet. I love how simple and quick it is to accomplish tasks that you adjust and readjust often, such as WiFi, Bluetooth, SafeStay, or Airplane Mode). Like the Galaxy S4, it has some extra features that are just for show. I mean, it's almost annoying to have a tablet or phone that reacts to where you move your eyes. And the tablet's \"virtual assistant\" (substitute Siri) is fun to experiment with, but it's faster and easier to just get the jobs done yourself, using the internet or the phone's features. Voice recognition and mind reading still have a long way to go. Size-wise, the 8-inch format is perfect. That extra inch makes a world of difference, but doesn't make the tablet unwieldy. Battery life is decent, recharging is fast. Watching movies and TV is fun (note: to watch Amazon videos, download Maxthon Browser), and the sound quality is fine. Downloading pdf files is occasionally slow, but it gets the job done.  Last thing:  If you're a student, think about getting the Samsung Galaxy Note. It's more expensive, but seems like a great tablet for using in class.Update 12/1/2013:  I've dropped my review from 5-stars to 4 because it seems that a common problem with the Tab 3 is that the battery fails to charge and you have to jump through a few hoops to solve the problem. When I noticed that charging my tablet overnight only got me a 42% charge, I went online to find out why. First suggestion was to \"restart\" it by unplugging it, holding the power button for 30 seconds, and then plugging it back in. This worked and I got a 100% charge in a couple of hours. But I'm worried it seems to be losing its charge faster than it has in the past. Over the past few months that I've had it, it would stay charged overnight. Now, it seems to be draining the battery while it sits, in resting mode. If this continues, my next step is to call Samsung tech support, and then possibly send it back to them for them to look at and hopefully fix. It's still under its 12-month limited warranty, so I'll see how it goes and get back with updates later.", "Date": "November 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Lots of Bang for the Buck", "Author": "R. T.

I thought it would clear up after a while. It didn't, after two days of not connecting to wifi I returned it and got another. The second performed correctly out the box, but 5 hours later dropped wifi giving the error message (AUTHENTIFICATION ERROR OCCURRED). The funny thing is none of the other equipment connected via wifi was affected. I was able to log onto the internet without issue with both my laptops. Of course I googled the error message and found that a number of people had the same issue and no forthcoming solutions from Android or Samsung. I tried all of the routine checks, restarting the router, checking the settings on the tab itself nothing worked. Unfortunately I will be returning my second tab 3. As I write this I noticed my galaxy s3 has the wifi issue. I never noticed before, I guess because I can still surf the net via the sprint network.

However, there are a few questionable aspects to this tablet and you definitely pay the premium for one extra inch of screen. I got this because I did want the 8 inch screen and prefer android over apple. But I feel this is overpriced for the following reasons: you pay $100 extra for the 1 extra inch of screen, a first generation ipad mini starts at the same price, and the processor is dual and not quad like any other higher end tablets now. My biggest complaint is that Samsung still uses the cheap slippery plastic backing. This product is nice and thin which I like, but the extra width that the 8 inch screen causes mixed with the slippery back makes it a necessity to buy a case just so you have something to grip onto. This is still the nicest tablet I have had and I definitely like it, but I would only recommend it to people that strongly prefer android over apple and people that really want that 8 inch screen. Otherwise, there are definitely more cost effective alternatives. This is another classic Samsung product move designed to eat into Apple's sales so it will not likely blow you away so to say.Pros: nice 8 inch screen, thin and light for the size, a few nice apps that allow you to multi-task, use as remote control, etc., less than average bloatwareCons: very slippery and can be awkward to hold, price seems high when compared to other products", "Date": "November 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "fantastic!", "Author": "lily", "ReviewID": "RNEFCEQWB6CV1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the galaxy tab 3 8\" tablet a few days ago.

Firth", "ReviewID": "R1XD50CGFRJZFE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have an iPad 4, TRIED the Kindle Fire HD 7-inch, and have owned at least 6 Kindle and other readers. For me, the iPad is just too heavy to use comfortably. It is tiring and annoying in any position. Check the specs -- this 8.0 is actually LIGHTER than the Kindle Fire HD 7-inch. The Kindle HD has better sound, but I wouldn't use either device for anything that needs audio without earbuds. It is the perfect size and weight for a personal device. I was really surprised how much difference the 8-inch screen makes over the 7-inch. I can use the browser(s) comfortably, where the 7-inch was almost unreadable. Note that the aspect ratio is wider than the iPad, so you're getting a much more usable screen for many purposes, especially browsing and watching videos. Most of the screen of the iPad (at least my 8.9 inch) is completely wasted for movies - large black bars above and below. NOTE: If you want to download movies, Google Play ONLY lets you store them on the device, which is pretty nearly useless since there are only about 9 or 10 GB left out of 16 GB. I immediately added a 64 GB Class 10 SDHC card, but Google and Samsung don't use it. The ONLY movie service I've found that downloads movies or TV to SD is VUDU. I highly recommend it, unless anyone can suggest an alternative.I was concerned that this device might be slower than the Kindle Fire HD or the Galaxy Note 8.0, but I cannot see any lag, and surfing seems very good and plenty fast. I'm getting over 20 MBPS download speeds using the GIST test tool and FIOS. Unless you specifically need the drawing features of the Note, I think you'll be pleased with the Tab 3 8-inch.One criticism: I found that the AUTO brightness default on the Tab 3 8.0 was FAR too dim for indoor use, and I was adjusting manually instead. Download LUX Free, and you can change those characteristics.

I decided to go with Android. I looked at all of the Android tablets and kept coming back to Samsung.I initially bought a Galaxy Tab 3 7 inch. The first one had defective home button so I exchanged it. I used the GT3-7 for a few days and wasn't satisfied. I found it to be sluggish and the screen was just too small. The next week,  the 8 inch GT3 went on sale at a local big box store for $70 off the list price,  just $30 more than the 7 inch. So I traded the 7 for an 8. What a difference! Better operating system, better screen,  faster processor,  etc.The GT3-8 is very fast, smooth and easy to use.  Web browsing is very pleasant because the screen is so crisp. I find that I can read many websites without my glasses, when I need the glasses to read the same sites on the Ipad 2.One factor that makes this a winner over the ipad is the SD expansion slot.  I don\u2019t know why Apple thinks 16 gb is all anyone will need in an affordable tablet. And they want to charge you an extra $100 for every additional 16 gb. I added 16 gb to my GT3 for $15. If I need more, I can easily add 64 GB for less than $100.The IR blaster was an unexpected bonus. We use the Smart Remote app and it has pretty much replaced our old remotes, plus finding shows is so much easier using this app than the cruide guides provided by cable systems.Battery life is at least as good with this tablet as it is with the ipad. I can get more than 8 hours of heavy use with no problems.I am now an Android convert.  I have used PCs for 25 years and I like to have the ability to move files, etc. using an explorer. Again, Apple seems to think I should not be able to look under the hood of my device,  while Android opens it up for anyone who wants it. Moving files from a PC to this device is as easy as connecting the usb cable and away you go.I am also finding the predictive keyboard to be a time saver. It seems to learn your writing style and improves over time.  I am much faster on this tablet than on the Ipad. No doubt you can get better keyboard apps for the ipad,  but this feature was built in with the GT3.The Google play store has everything I need. I downloaded Kingsoft Office as I find it better than Polaris,  which shipped on the GT3. This tablet is very easy to use for reading work documents,  pdfs, etc.The only downsides I've found with this tablet are- the capacitive back and menu keys are easy to touch accidentally,  but you get used to working around them. And I\u2019ve found that having the back key always under your thumb is actually very convenient most of the time.- there isn't much of a selection of cases for the GT3-8. If you have an Ipad,  there are hundreds,  but only a few for this unit.  That's not a fault of Samsung,  but it is a downside.The upsides are many,  a few of which I have listed above. But the bottom line is that this is the best tablet I have found for the money.  It looks great, works fantastic and seems to be built to last.  If you are looking for a tablet in this size range,  don't waste your money on the Ipad mini.  Buy the GT3-8. You won't regret it.", "Date": "January 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Light, small, fast, awesome", "Author": "S.

Till now it's held up pretty good with no crashes even while being heavily loaded with games and apps.Main reason why I bought this:1. Screen size of 8in is just right for reading/gaming/surfing. Not too big/heavy as a 10in and nicer than a 7in. I could have bought the 7in also but this is only slightly heavier and has much better hardware. Its easy to hold for long reading hours.2. More RAM/Memory + good CPU means better gaming experience and no lags during surfing/movies.3. I don't a personal PC/Laptop right now (2 office ones). So I use this one for surfing, personal mails, games, etc.4. I read lots of comics and magazines. This is where this excels. Bright colors and very vivid.Rest of advantages you can check from other reviews.Cons:None really. Though it would have been good if back cover could be opened, but its sealed tight. So no getting to the battery. Side buttons seem bit too thin at times (but Tabs really slim which is plus).Must have add-ons which I bought on Amazon : 1) Screen Guard (ArmorSuit MilitaryShield - 4*), 2) Good Case (MoKo Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 Case - 5*), 3) Micro SD (SanDisk Ultra 16 GB MicroSDHC Class 10 - 5*, fast but later regretted not buying 32 Gbs)My frequently used Android Apps : Perfect Viewer for Comics/Mags (great app), Dead Trigger 2 (plays very smooth), Injustice.., Skype, WeChat, PvZ2, etc. All working fine with no lags.

It closely resembles my Galaxy S3 smartphone, but even thinner with three times the screen space. Web surfing is far peppier than with Kindle Fire's wretched Silk browser. I typically have 65% power at the end of the day even though I use it for web surfing, email, Netflix, Kindle and Nook books, full-length movies, mp3, Facebook and tons of other \"stuff.\" It contains front and rear facing cameras of low to medium resolution, but sports a brilliant sharp screen. Road warriors can find inexpensive Bluetooth keyboard/case combinations.One of the Galaxy Tab's biggest benefits is that marvelous microSD slot that is missing from most tablets--I mean YOU, Kindle Fire and overpriced iPad! You can load 64 GB of movies, mp3, books, documents and other media to avoid clogging the tablet's resources. The Samsung micro SDXC UHS-1 PRO 64GB Class 10 card works perfectly without formatting. You can even attach a thumb drive to the Galaxy Tab via an OTG connector.--MINOR QUIBBLES--The two speakers on the bottom produce decent volume, but I wish they had placed them at the top/bottom (left/right) for better stereo separation. A bigger negative is that there are NO power or email notification or white light LEDs. The unit is a blank slab until powered up.I received my Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 from Amazon in just two days, but experienced a couple of unpleasant surprises when I opened the package. First, the Samsung box was torn open at both ends! Even though there is a big warning sticker not to accept the device if the seal is broken, I decided to risk it and see if it worked.I plugged it in and pressed the power button, but my heart sank when nothing happened. I kept mashing the button, waiting for the screen to flicker, when suddenly heard the musical boot tone sounded. Surprise! It turns out that the transparent-looking plastic screen covering is actually opaque black plastic! It looks just like a blank screen and I had left it attached in case I needed to return the tablet. Huh--a rather poor packaging idea, IMO.The minimal instructions and box are printed on crummy brown recycled paper about the color and texture of old cardboard. Bleah. Luckily you can find the real manual in .pdf form on line.Then it took me FOREVER to find the darn serial number so I could register my new toy. Turns out the serial number is actually printed on the label of the box that tears when you open it. D'oh! You get a bunch of freebies if you register, but only a couple are worthwhile.--FINALLY--I connected to my WiFi in seconds with a maxed-out signal. There was a big firmware upgrade available bringing it up to Android version 4.2.2. Sweet!Lightweight, slim and powerful at at a modest price, the Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 earns a solid five stars!

However, after using the Tab 3 for a few weeks, I regretted not having bought the Note 8 instead. Though I loved the size, feel, look, features and light weight of the Tab 3, I was ultimately disappointed with it, and ended up sending it back for a few reasons. It seemed to lag on a fairly frequent basis, and scrolling wasn't usually very smooth. Also, since it has such a thin bezel on the sides, I had difficulty holding it, which to my annoyance resulted in accidentally pressing the buttons on the bottom of the device countless times (though I ordered a case for it after about two weeks of use without one, which did make it somewhat easier to hold).  After sending it back,  Amazon quickly credited my account, and I ordered the Note 8 instead, which I am quite happy with. It's easier to hold because the bezel is wider. I have not experienced any lagging after a couple of weeks of use. I also have to say that with the Tab 3, I really missed not having the S Pen like my Note 2 phone and the Note 8 both have. I much prefer the S Pen over using my fingers or a regular size stylus.Overall, I thought the Tab 3 was a nice tablet for the most part, and I probably would have kept it if it weren't for the lagging and the accidental button pressing. From the reviews I read on Amazon, lots of people are very happy with it, but for me it was worth the extra money to switch to the Note 8 (although I must say I do think that Samsung has priced it too high).", "Date": "October 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Loving it - Esp. the IR Remote/Peel App", "Author": "SMB", "ReviewID": "R3R6VEZCM81XN5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this for a few days now and I'm loving it.  Why the Galaxy?  I recently got a Macbook Air (which is awesome) but I decided that a very similar OS on a tablet would be boring (and didn't want to spent over $500 on a tablet!) so I decided to look for an android tablet over iPad.  Based on ratings and reviews, I narrowed it to the Galaxy Tab 3 and the Google Nexus.  The Google Nexus has slightly higher specs and a super hi res screen but it isn't as polished a device as the Galaxy.  Users commented on the Nexus saying that it was lagging and freezing.  It also looks like something from a couple years ago both in terms of exterior appearance and the interface.  Super hi res screens on tablets is a bit ridiculous IMO - my 47\" LED is 1080 so having something double that on a 7-10\" screen is just not a huge improvement.  The reviews on the Galaxy were high, it is an established and polished model, the interface looks great and my favorite - it includes an IR emitter and the Peel entertainment system app.  I chose the 8\" size as it's the perfect size and has higher RAM than the 8\" and 10.1\".  Also, I think that 7\" and below is too small for a tablet and 10\" is encroaching on too large for ease of portability and handling.It has been great so far - some pros:-Easy to set up-Has been zippy-Good interface-Clear, nice image-Size is perfect and it's really thin - thinner than my Motorola Droid Razr Maxx-Well pricedI love the IR emitter and Peel application - in addition to the low price, this added feature made getting a tablet definitely worth it.  I've set it up with my living room entertainment system consisting of a LED, A/V Receiver w/ Surround, Verizon FIOS cable box, Blu Ray player and Roku.  I can enter the app and choose 'watch roku, watch blu ray or watch tv' and when I select those options - it will set the correct TV and Receiver input, turn on the necessary components and then gives you an on tablet remote control for that device to navigate the Roku, DVD player or TV.  You can set it to use the AV receiver as your sound for each device so when you use the + - sound keys on the digital remote - it will change the receiver sound.  The home page lists everything that's currently on cable by categories like 'drama' or 'reality'.  You can click on the program and it changes your cable box to that channel.  I like this more than the Verizon FIOS remote app which gives you a TV guide like interface to browse to choose a show as it organizes shows by categories and has a picture for each program so you can more quickly see what's on.  You can also add your favorite channels to the top bar and under each channel image it lists what is currently airing on each.  You can also view what's on later in the day and set alarm reminders for upcoming shows.  Very sweet.  I love it as I watch a lot of TV/movies and do not like using 5 different remotes.  There are universal remotes with LCD screens that cost $200 - why get one of those when you can have it in within an even better interface and multifunctioning tablet.Of note:  To set up my receiver, I had to run the pairing a few times....  it will find a code that turns off your receiver but that doesn't mean that the first one it finds is the right one for your model.  I had to rerun it three times telling it that a specific code did not turn on the receiver when it really did as when that code was used - the list of inputs did not match its actual inputs.", "Date": "September 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Tablet", "Author": "Lorie", "ReviewID": "R1JLCXE6PH41PV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really only use this tablet to check email and go online and once in a while I will play some games.

As far as I have been able to determine the Tab 3 8.0 does not have HDMI out at all, even with an adapter.  While HDMI is a nice feature its lack is not a deal breaker for me since I would rarely use it.ADDED 7/30/2013:  If anyone needs a nice carrying case (not cover) check out a Rip Offs CO-58.  It is the perfect size for the Tab 3 8.0, even in a Moko cover and has a couple of small pockets on the front just right for OTG adapter, flash drives, USB cables, etc.  CO is clip on, BL-58 has a belt loop.  I mainly use it for packing everything together and adding a little extra protection when I travel.ADDED later on 7/19/2013:  Does anyone else find the micro USB port difficult to plug into?  I sent my firt Tab 3 back because I could not get either the cable that came with it or any of the many I own to even start to plug in.  When I got a replacement I was able to get the factory cable and most others plugged in, but a couple still won't go in at all.  They work fine on the many other micro USB devices I own.Following up my comments about USB keyboard below, I found an app called External Keyboard Helper that reprograms some USB keyboard keys such as the Esc key to emulate the Android \"Back\" button and Shift+Alt Esc to emulate the \"Home\" button.  Like holding \"Home\" holding Shift+Alt Esc displays open apps.  It also works with most bluetooth keyboards.ORIGINAL POST:I deleted my earlier pre-delivery post rather than update it.  I am thrilled with the features I mentioned in the title.  They are the only things that kept my Tab 2 7 from being nearly perfect for me.  I have grown to HATE proprietary connectors as they limit your choices of available adapters.  Now I I like to have HDMI out capability for travel.  The Tab 2 does not have this capability, period.  Even with an adapter.  I am very happy the side bezels have been narrowed.  The Tab 3 8 is only .07\" wider than Tab 2 7, which is nothing, and only .5\" longer.  8\" screen and not much bigger overall.  Even in a case I can slip it in my pocket if I need to.  8\" vs 7\" is a HUGE difference.  For the last 4 years I spent a couple of hours a day on a 7\" netbook then a 10.1\" so I am very comfortable with the 8\", though I will still use my new 11.6\" netbook most of the time!  Other reviewers have done a great job praising the many features of the Tab 3 8.0 so I will limit my review to try to flesh out some of its USB capabilities.I immediately tried this micro USB OTG adapter and a flash drive:  T & S Electronics Micro USB[[ASIN:B000Q8UAWY Belkin USB 2.0 4-Port Ultra-Mini Hub OTG Cable - LIFETIME WARRANTY! (Micro USB OTG to USB Adapter. Samsung Galaxy S4, HTC ONE, Nexus 7 & Nexus 10, Galaxy Tab 3 and all OTG compatible devices.]]  The Tab 3 read the drive just fine.  Next, I unmounted the flash drive and plugged in this Belkin Ultra Mini USB Hub: Belkin USB 2.0 4-Port Ultra-Mini Hub and re-inserted the flash drive.  Still good.  Then I plugged in a USB keyboard and mouse, and all three devices were fully functional.  Now the piece de resistance.  Using this Y cable, Apricorn USB Power Adapter Y Cable AUSB-Y USB (Black/Grey), I connected a 2.5\" external hard drive to the hub and a USB power adapter (you could use the Tab 3's).  The Tab 3 recognized it, but could not read the NTFS file system.  I am certain a drive formatted FAT32 would work fine.  Using the N_xus (fill in an e) Photo Viewer app I could read the drive but could only open photos.  There is a paid version of the app that may allow more access.  This was just a test.  Unfortunately the only apps to fully read NTFS seem to require root.I have an HDMI adapter for my Galaxy Note phone that I will try as soon as I can and report back.That's about it for now except that I am typing this using the USB keyboard and mouse connected to the Belkin Hub!  Sometimes the onscreen keyboard will pop up and consume half the screen.  A right click on the mouse closes it.  Oh, the only minor thing that may have been better on the Tab 2 is that because the Menu Home Return buttons were soft buttons you could click on them with the mouse.  On the Tab 3 those are hard buttons that are off the screen so you cannot access them by mouse.  I am going to search to see if there are keyboard or mouse alternatives.", "Date": "July 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung Tab 3", "Author": "P.

I sold my IPAD 3 to buy this and don't regret it at all, the IPAD retina is overrated, its bland in colors. This one feels like a mini HDTV LEDTV. I also have the Samsung 10.1 Note both in white, I think they make it less industrail looking than black/brown, more like something to have fun with. Samsung is eating Apple's lunch.Sorry to say I have exchanged it for the Note 8.0. Reason-watching YouTube when you switch from landscape to portrait mode the video stops for bit. Drove me nuts, the Note 8.0 does not do this.The 8.0 can be a burden to hold at times I admit. So if I had my wish I wojld take a tab 3 8.

Apple prides itself on aesthetics and beauty, but they haven't had much of a hardware change in more than 2 years.  If you want to talk about beauty, The GOLD-BROWN TAB 3 8 inch is perhaps the most beautiful and aesthetically pleasing tablet in its class.I recently upgraded my iPhone4S to a GALAXY S4 and couldn't be more pleased!  Although there is a bit of a learning curve for me in regards to certain Android OS differences from iOS (in particularly  all the settings choices), I am getting the hang of my S4 and have become a bit angry that Apple puts a lot of roadblocks up not allowing android devices direct access to iTunes and the whole Samsung vs. Apple thing that only hurts customers in the long run.  I have begun to find ways around Apple's roadblocks with the many apps that get around Apple's nonsense and allow me access to my music on whatever device I want it on.  My frustration with Apple has now led me to the GALAXY TAB 3 which is slowly replacing my 3rd Generation iPad.  Through Kies, DropBox, Chrome, Google Music, and Polaris suite of apps, I am finding my way into the world of Samsung and the many choices Jelly Bean android allows me to sync and personalize my devices MY WAY, instead of having some Apple designer in his IVES Tower tell me how they want my devices to work!", "Date": "July 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "This tablet is awesome", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1O157LKGEM8PG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I never write reviews and I am writing this one from my tab 3.

My case came with a very nice stylus, and it works perfectly with the tablet. I hype this product up constantly to my friends and family, because I have used the Nexus 7, all iPads released up until March of 2014, and I have used Samsung's Note tablets also. This tablet, being only $250, is definitely my favorite. Sure, if the Samsung Note tablet was $250, I would have gotten that, but it isn't. So, this is by far the best choice. I also love the Brown/Gold color. It makes it look super classy. I just recently ROOTed my tablet just to check it out, and it works perfectly fine still, and I play graphically intense games on it with ease. I love playing Asphalt 8 on it. It is a great, free, game on the app store. I advise EVERYONE to get this tablet. It is perfect for kids, teenagers, young adults, and mature adults.

Easier than either holding the button (IOS and android) then scrolling to your desired app.  I installed Pie Control (doesn't require root) and set it up with my most-commonly used stuff (2 arcs 4 positions each plus long-hold choices for each if desired).I found the built-in keyboard to be interesting - number keys are drawn in above the alpha.  This isn't an option in either Swype or IOS.I use Swype by preference - the ability to do such things is a primary dislike I have of IOS.I've set Chrome as the defualt browser so e-mail links automatically open in Chrome (also impossible on IOS).I happen to prefer browsing using a BT keyboard in my lap for typing.

I don't regret the purchase._______________________________________________________UpdateAbout a month ago I tried charging the tab but there was no indication that power was reaching the device. I changed the charger a couple times and tried changing the charging source from the electrical outlet on the wall to the PC via a USB cord. I restarted it, this did not work either. I tried 'googling' the problem and after two or three words google had auto-completed the problem.....I wasn't the only one having the same issue with a Samsung device. I saw and tried several fixes. The one that eventually worked was re-setting the device - which annoyed me because I had to wait for all the apps to be re-installed. This I had to make sure was done while I had a wifi connection in order for me to access my offline apps when I am not able to receive a wifi connection.After thinking that the problem was solved, it happened a week later. I did the same re-set and it worked, again. After a little over another week, it happened again, except this time the re-set didn't work. I found another fix online that recommended holding down the power+volume buttons at the said simultaneously. I have had to do that about 3 times since the first fix stop responding. Holding down the buttons have been working so far. But sometimes I think the speed at which it is charged moves a bit slow.It's such a shame that I have to downgrade my 5 star rating because I really like the look, feel and operation of the device. But a faulty charging issue is way past annoying to say the least..it's poor.

There is Skype and video chats. The Mega has a 6.3\" screen which is fantastic. Large for a cell phone but although I'm on the small side with small hands, it doesn't pose any problems for me.

I decided to go to a smaller format, and was looking at the ipad mini and several android tablets.  Mostly I do a lot of reading in landscape on my tablet so I focused on the ipad and android 8 inch formats.  For a slightly older set of eyes, I thought 8\" would be more useful than smaller screen sizes.  I ended up with the Samsung because of  the screen resolution, latest version of Android, and powerful processor.  It is far faster than my old ipad, and I love the HD size screen rather than the 4:3 proportion of ipads.  In a pinch, I can put it in one of my pants pockets for carrying around, but the screen is plenty large enough for reading and using apps.  I actually really like the Samsung mail app that comes preloaded, but I do use the Chrome browser, which loads quickly and allows easy selection of desktop vs. mobile sites.  Since I'm a gmail user, the seamless integration of android works terrifically.  After 4 months of use, the only downside I see is that it doesn't co-exist with my apple tv, and battery life is compromised vs my old ipad.  I easily get a full days use on battery, but recharge every night.  My old ipad I would charge probably every third day, but such is the reality of a brighter display in a smaller form factor.

I did not give the Kindle a rave review as I feel the software implementation is rather poor.Now this tablet is a full Android and the functionality is impressive, especially comparing to Kindle Fire HD7,It is fast, supports full device encryption, allows a microSD .The KFHD7 does have better speakers though.No amazon prime instant streaming app available to android phones/tablets, and Adobe stopped support for mobile devices browsers. Old versions of Flash player will work for now, but the point is Amazon lacks an app for Android. Amazon is leveraging that to drive sales of Kindle. That could be a reason not to buy this tablet, however netflix works great.So the KFHD7 does not come with power charger and Amazon charges $19.95 for one and $15.00 to make the Kindle add free. Add that up and the price between this 8 inch Galaxy and the KFHD7 is pretty small. I was lured into the Kindle by price and I feel I got robbed! My child is now the sole user of the Kindle.It should be noted that no concept of \"FreeTime\" is available for this tablet. I'd still recommend the KFHD7 for youngsters.

Bell", "ReviewID": "R30J511V4WG9AG", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Perhaps my unit was a lemon, but I can only speak from my experience.  This is coming from a PC-owner (an HP laptop running on Windows 8, jumping to this from XP), and an iPod Touch 4(first and only Apple product) owner. So, setting up a device under different types of platforms is not a completely new concept to me (though I'll admit, I'm no expert). However, family and friends usually come to ME for help when they have computer tech issues.I was pushed into purchasing the Galaxy instead of the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" at a local store by a rep for Samsung working inside said store. I should have sensed a problem because the first time I went into the store after Christmas, the Samsung reps were swarming over the tablet section pushing their product over the Kindles, iPads, and Google Nexus tabs. (They get a commission, and each claims to own a Samsung tablet with which they are thrilled, which I suspect they get for a deep discount. It makes sense they are less than objective.) So sadly, I caved from my original intention when I entered the store, and came home with the Galaxy.(As a side note:  I've noticed the bad reviews on this device are getting a \"not helpful\" vote on them, which makes me suspect many votes are from Samsung reps who are working on commission, based on the attitudes and behaviors of the reps I saw in the electronics store.)I regretted my purchase within an hour of turning it on, setting it up, and starting to download apps when I got home. The download time was slower than molasses even with my broadband WiFi connection, and the interface was cluttered and confusing on the tablet.  Trying to group apps into folders was confusing at best.For those people who would say I just didn't get used to Android because Apple had \"spoiled\" me, let me say that the Kindle uses Android, but Amazon makes the setup process and UI much easier to navigate. Perhaps Android could take some lessons from both Amazon and Apple.Physically, I'd also say that owning a case for this is a MUST. It's way too thin to hold comfortably, the back is slick and tends to heat up on one side too much while charging, which can cause your hands to sweat and have a moist and slippery environment with your equipment (not a good combo at all for electronic devices that you want to last). I also found this device uncomfortable to hold in one hand because of its size. The weight is distributed across the device such that holding with one hand can be difficult, and would especially be for anyone with small hands.Let me give some positives on the device, which had convinced me to buy it over the Kindle to start with:1. Expandable memory with MicroSD card.2. Multi-window App Accessibility.... (NOTE: It only works with CERTAIN pre-installed apps on the device, NOT every app you install. This was not revealed by the rep who sold the device to me. I thought it worked with everything, much like my split-screen functionality of my Windows 8 laptop.)3. Screen-mirroring (which could only be used with purchase of additional $70 device to hook up to TV, etc.) The rep claimed that the Kindle Fire HDX did not have this, but upon getting the Fire, I learned that the Fire DOES have this ability under the Settings menu, called \"Display Mirroring... same thing.4. 5MP rear cameraHowever, all the great features in the world don't mean squat if you can't get the equipment to work. When you can't download apps because they are loading at a snail's pace, and when you try YouTube and Netflix to have them buffer every 10 seconds (tried even at 2AM, when no one else was using our Internet connection), it's clear you have a slow piece of overpriced electronic equipment. It took deleting all but 3 apps on the tablet to get YouTube to even work without immediately buffering.Multi-tasking on this device is difficult because of the processor speed. It doesn't run other apps well if you are downloading something in the background. It simply doesn't have the processor speed or RAM to support it, so don't expect to download an app in the background while trying to play a game. It won't be pretty.So great was my frustration that I returned it to the store within 24 hours and bought what I had originally intended to get in the first place for $70 less... the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" (purchased on sale for $199).  My experience with the Kindle has been like day versus night in comparison to the Galaxy with setup and UI. The speed outshines Samsung by miles (compare a 2.2GHz quad-core processor with 2GB RAM in the Kindle HDX to a 1.5GHz dual-core and 1.5GB RAM in the Galaxy, and you will notice a HUGE difference). I have had the Kindle for 3 days now, and have not had a problem yet.Based on my experience, in my opinion, Samsung should stick to producing TVs and BluRay players and stay out of the tablet business.

Screen has the 16:9 viewing ratio which is perfect for watching videos.  I have the Galaxy S4 Mini phone, and this tablet duplicates the S4 experience on a larger screen, which is fine by me.  For $249.99 it's a very good tablet.  If you don't mind buying refurbished, Woot.com (where I bought mine) is selling the same model now for $159.99, and for that price it's an outstanding tablet.

(That tablet while chunky and heavy served me well for several years).  I wanted to get something a little smaller so I first purchased an Asus Memopad HD 7.  I was a little underwhelmed by the clarity of the screen, and the build quality of the Asus felt cheap.  I ended up giving the Asus as a Christmas present to someone.Decided I that what I needed was something slightly bigger, so I started looking at the 8-inchers.  I was sold on the Samsung when I saw that it came in a Gold-Brown color  (I really didn't want an all-white or all-black tablet).  As I wanted it right away I ended up purchasing it from a nearby \"big-box office supply store\" (honestly 6 months later, I couldn't tell you which one).  It doesn't really matter as this is one of those price controlled products that will end up being the same price on Azon or a big box retailer.At any rate, when I picked up the tablet for the first time, I was really impressed with the build quality.  The build quality (along with the great brown-gold color scheme) really made this tablet feel like an \"executive\" accessory.The screen on this is MUCH sharper and colorful than the screen on my old Toshiba Thrive or the Asus Memopad.Sorry, didn't run any sort of benchmark tests on it, but the interface felt very responsive.  It's very \"smooth\" unlike the Asus Memopad, which (while faster than the Galaxy Tab) had a somewhat \"jerky\" UI experience.  The Samsung was just a better experience.I use Netflix on this tablet, and it runs and looks great.  I don't do much gaming on tablets so I can't speak about that, but the Amazon Kindle app runs great on it, as does the standard stuff like my email client, evernote, etc.As a bonus, the tablet came with free 50gb of drop box storage, which I found to be VERY useful to move files between PC/Laptop/Tablet and phone.  I think I also got some Google Play credit, as well as some other \"Samsung Perks\" that I never used like 3 months of free XM radio, free audio books from Audible, etc.Of course just as I write this review, the new Galaxy Tab 4's have just been released.

It was easy to fall in love with. But a problem here, an issue there, and within a few weeks off we went for e-therapy, commonly known as tech support. Sadly, Samsung tech support was . . . unsupportive. It was lackluster. It didn't sparkle. So the gorgeous tablet, with its issues unresolved, went back to Amazon -- which has a fabulous customer support staff -- and I went on to another tablet from a company that wasn't Samsung and was willing to provide detailed, helpful tech support. When you fall in love with an e-device, you're basically marrying its tech support. No matter how gorgeous the e-device is, no matter what it promises you, it's only as good as the tech support staff behind it.

I give 4 stars for this product because of the quality of the camera. I've tried camera of Galaxy S4 (phone), Galaxy Note 2 (phone), Galaxy Tab 2 (this one), iPad 3, and iPhone 4. The quality of the pictures taken from Apple products are way better than Samsung's. I think my iPhone 4 has better camera compare to Samsung Galaxy S4 & Note 2 (iPhone 4 has 5.0MP, Note 2 has 8.0MP, S4 has 13.0MP).  Besides, I am so satisfied with features of this tablet. It is light enough to be held with one hand, whenever you stand, sit, or lie. I like the widgets, which Apple products don't have. Moreover, I can use this tablet as a GPS. I downloaded the app called \"Navigator\" and use it as an GPS. It works offline because of the maps saved in microSD card.  I used this tablet mostly for reading. I have a lot of pdf, epub, and other files on Dropbox. All I have to do is download them to the tablet and enjoy the books.  It does have \"Smart Remote\" which can be used for most TV. It worked with my old CRT Mitsubishi. S Voice is also very funny to play with.  Things I do not really like are music app, Youtube app, and the files are so unorganized. I used Chrome for watching Youtube, instead.  I prefer this one to iPad because it's light and doesn't stick with iTunes. In my opinion, the touch technology of Apple is the better than other companies, at least for now. Although this has better specs than iPad 3 does, I still feel iPad are smoother than this.  In general, this is a good tablet. I would be happier if it was less expensive a little. I recommend this tablet for students and people who like to read. Do not buy if you want to use it for taking pictures.", "Date": "July 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazon Prime Movies?

Also, I learned through a chat with Amazon customer service that Amazon is now using Silverlight for their instant videos and is no longer using Flash.Original Review: I bought this primarily for traveling, so I could access the internet, play movies and games on the plane, etc.This has a wonderful display. But to stream or download Amazon Prime Movies you need Adobe Flash. And unfortunately, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8 doesn't support Adobe Flash. So you can't stream or download Amazon Prime movies. You can view movies through Google Play, but they seem much more limited in the number of free or reasonably priced movies.I agree with another reviewer who said that the Samsung Galaxy is very google-centric, which I'm not crazy about due to data privacy issues. This device is really designed to work with google apps and products. Unless you want to go down the google road, this device is a headache. (For example it took me 30 minutes to change the default browser from Google.)This is my first experience with tablets and I have to say I feel that they are very overrated, or if they were less expensive it might be worth it. Most of the tablet platforms don't play well together or force you to use certain products, which is unfortunate for consumers. I would rather get a smaller laptop and have full features and have more flexibility in choosing the products and service providers I use.Update: 11/11/12 -I signed out to update my review in terms of privacy with this device.If you value your privacy (and I don't mean that sarcastically -- some people really don't care about sharing a lot of information) you may have a hard time with how much of your privacy you are prompted to or must waive to google to use the device and many of the features. For example, I have received book suggestions based on the content in my gmail/google hangouts, you have to enter a credit card to download free content from the google play store, and many others. I realize that most people born after 1990 have a different outlook on this compared to people who remember life before facebook, and computers for that matter.I agree with the person who commented that another tablet might be better for people who want to use a tablet for pure recreation. I want to turn the thing on and be able to watch a movie or play a few games. I don't want to spend a lot of time searching for ways to do something that I should be able to do with a single tap on the tablet.For people who say there is a way to stream or download amazon prime movies on this device and/or download adobe flash (that's required to stream/download amazon prime movies), please share the step-by-step how-to details in the comments. If I find a way to do so, I will update the review. I've seen a lot of how-tos on installing flash on tablets running jellybean 4.1, but nothing for jellybean 4.3. Also there seems to be a way to download flash on android phones running 4.3, but not tablets. So until then, I stand by my review that you cannot stream or download amazon prime movies on this device.", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Returned twice due to the same issue.

The experience of owning one for the first time was great. My problem happened about a week or less before I took it back to Costco. The battery on my brand new tablet device was bad. It stopped giving an accurate estimation of the battery life and stopped charging altogether. I tried different cables and outlets (it uses a universal USB cable) and it still would not charge. The battery ended up dying and I held the power button to see if it was really out of battery. It wasn't! It had 4x% battery remaining. It had to reboot to see the remaining energy. It's nice to know when my tablet is going to die and when it isn't. I plugged the tablet back in with its new 4x% and it still remained uncharged.Needless to say, I returned it to get a new one. This one lasted about a month longer until I ran into the same battery issue. I plugged it in and it no longer charged. On top of that I had an issue where my screen went completely bonkers and wouldn't let me control anything (this was a one time thing, but it was interesting seeing my tablet rearrange itself).Is this device all bad?

I would leave mine over night with 90% charge, bluetooth off, battery saving mode off, most apps shut down and it would be dead the next morning.

I've been using Windows since before windows - in the era of DOS and currently have a Win 7 PC. I've been using various distros of Linux since 99 and Mac OS since 0S 8 and loved my Amiga 2000. My current phone is an iPhone 4s. My wife wanted a tablet so after some research, the Samsung appeared to fit the requirements.

I had a chance to also use it to become familiar with it and help my wife who is defiantly a non tech type. Over all I was fairly pleased with the android OS  though have had issues getting credit for appps that came with buying the device. Android on this device was easy for me to pick up and the only initial complaints I had were the case I bought and difficulty of getting a easy to apply screen cover which no matter how hard I tried would not adhere to the screen without bubbles which would get worse after just a few days usage - made me truly appreciate my otterbox for my iPhone. generally speaking the apps are good - just not quite as good as my iPhone apps but over all I'd say They did the their job good -I care for my electronics so I can assure that this device was well cared for and protected from tje elements than can cripple or ruin any electronic device. So today after, after charging was completed, and indicated that the battery was full. The unit was unplugged from the wall and NO GO. The on/ off switch did not function and so far have been unable to get the table to turn. So the only rating I can give it is 1  - for it to die with less than 2 months of usage is unacceptable.

That is it. No other reasons.If you are content with 7-inch then get a new Nexus7, it is faster, has higher resolution and is cheaper. If you like Macs or prefer 4x3 screen then get iPad Mini, although its pixel density is too low for reading. Finally, if you want an Android tablet larger than 7-inch then find a Toshiba Excite 7.7 on a closeout sale for $200, it is a better tablet than the Tab3 8.0.Now in more detail.* The screen is ok. Not super high-res, but higher resolution than the iPad Mini, ok for reading although I can see some aliasing but I don't see pixels. I do see pixels on the iPad Mini, which means that 163 ppi (the Mini) is not enough, while 189 ppi (the Tab3 8.0) is just ok. I would prefer 250 ppi for comfortable reading. The screen has proper white balance, not bluish or greenish, and shadows and highlights are rendered well.* It is fast enough for reading, some gaming and watching movies. No problem with 720p MKV video.* JB 4.2 is a rather modern Android version. But it is in phone mode, not tablet mode, meaning different location of some controls like notifications. Just a gotcha, not really a problem.* Physical buttons are old tech for Android, but Samsung still uses them. Ok, I don't mind, with physical buttons the whole screen is used for content, which is always good. But the Menu and Back buttons are too sensitive and get in the way when you use the tablet with two hands in landscape mode. Really, really annoying and you cannot turn them off! I've read that only if you root the system you can change system properties to turn the pesky buttons off. But then some people have problems turning them back on. So beware.* No finger rejection feature that the iPad Mini has. Basically, you can hold the Mini with the thumb on the screen and still use another finger for tapping. Not so with the Tab3 8.0, and you cannot hold it at the edge as the bezel is too thin. Holding it with two hands is problematic as I wrote above, so the only way to hold the Tab3 is across the back, in open palm of the hand. Pitiful ergonomics. Samsung engineers never tried using their product, I am sure it went directly from a computer model to production.* White plastic instead of aluminum or magnesium. I personally don't care, but after a couple of weeks the shiny plastic will get all scratched, and the tablet will look like 5-year old device.* MicroSD slot is good, what can I say. No HDMI out, whatever.* Charges through USB, no separate charge port. This is good as you don't need extra cables, but charging takes long time.* Specs: ok for 2012, not enough for 2013. The Toshiba Excite 7.7 released a year ago has the same or better specs and better build quality and is thinner.* Discharge when in standby mode: initially it discharged in less than a day, twice. But charged for the third time and it is already a day and a half, and still 91% of juice left (wi-fi left on).

I don't like some device connected to the world, recording my face.Worst of all, the unit is almost impossible to use in the hand held horizontal position. They've got the \"back\" and \"menu\" buttons almost at the edge of the case, and you constantly are touching them inadvertently.
