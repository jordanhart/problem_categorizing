It has 6 GB storage. After installing bunch of applications, I still had available 5 GB. This runs Android 4.2.2. I have been using for few days with no issues. Obviously you should know the feature set and use within the limit. I will go into the specifications and review based on my user experience. The clarity of the screen is great for watching videos and reading e-books. The tablets are fast becoming commoditized and it is great we are seeing such value budget tablets. Performance was smooth among this price point 7\" tablets I had used in past several months. As you can see in my video review, Temple Run Oz can be played smoothly and it has a buttery feeling. The tablet feels nice to handhold and the USB Host interface tops it all. Hand holding was easy, and the blue color is so vibrant it pops out!Most of tablets have ARM based processors. This makes sure all of the Apps in Google Play ecosystem are available. This has Cortex A8 Dual Core 1.2 GHz. If you look at my video review, I have screenshots showing the CPU speed and other kernel details. The screen is 1024x 600 Pixels and has a RAM of 512MB. (DDR3 RAM).  This tablet has high-performance Quad Core Mali-400 GPU ensures smooth and dynamic 3D graphics. This supports a wireless and cellular with Wi-Fi (802.11 BGN) and Support for 3G Dongles. Settings page has a IMEI number already assigned. Tablet has 2 cameras - Front 0.3M/Rear 2M. There is a built-in 2800mAh Rechargeable Lithium Battery. Battery came for a good 5 hours with moderate usage. Battery usage really depends on how heavy you use the system. Overnight it drained very less. Mobile Networking was on by default. I switched off as I was using only Wi-Fi mode. I suggest you go to Settings and tweak things which are not required. Developer Mode was enabled by default. I turned it off. The capacitive touch screen was really good, some occasions I had to press little harder and at right locations, but pinch-zoom, highlight, Copy-Paste all worked very well.The tablet has micro USB Port, a regular USB port, 3.5-mm stereo Headphone Jack, built-in speaker, microphone, micro SD card slot (upto 32 GB), a DC Input Jack and a USB Host Interface. Note that for powering through wall adapter you need to use the provided DC input jack. Speaker was loud enough. IN a room, once I keep the tablet in a stand it was good. Speaker is on the backside, so you don't want to lie this down on back as it will hamper the audio coming out. This is a designAndroid tablets are really customizable to your heart's content. It is here where ProntoTec shines. Using a native Android 4.2.2, they have achieved something at a low cost. This can have a very wide reaching audience. In many countries, where affordability is key, having a tablet like this with Wi-Fi is a big boon. Imagine having entire Wikipedia at your fingertips for a child. I tried few educational applications on this. I consider this as a big hit with educators than gamers.I tried Google Voice Search and asked \"what is capital of United States\". The voice recognition part was great and it was able to recognize and dictate the answer. I also tried Wolfram Alpha and asked bunch of questions. E.g., what is world population, what is population of China etc? The microphone picked up correctly and answered through Wolfram Alpha. Apps like Calculator, Gmail performed flawlessly.I watched multiple video through few applications. Obvious first choice was YouTube. Was able to search and watch videos. Handholding is really easy given the weight of it. It was a colorful blue; no heat observed handholding the tablet. It is plastic, and buttons are made of plastic. For a kid, this is perfect also though the feature set is equally appealing to an adult. I was so enamored with low cost computers in late 90s and it seems I am reliving them with tablet. If you want to listen to podcasts/watch video then this is perfect. Just keep it in a stand and connect to power. See my video review to get an idea of what I am referring to.For a computer geek, it is a challenge to design something with minimal resources - screen resolution, RAM, storage, chipset. ProntoTec has designed a tablet with budget conscious customer in mind. Out of the box, it worked to my satisfaction given the specification and price. Once powered on, it directly came to a working condition. No need to setup account prior to using. I signed with wifi, the wifi router was in one bedroom. I configured in another room separated by two rooms. There was no issue with wifi signal. Once connected, I created a Google account as well. I generated a Application Specific password as I had 2 factor authentication. Once signed on, I updated applications like YouTube, Google Keyboard etc. I downloaded Chrome and browsed few websites. Listened to Audio / Watched Video. Out of the box battery needed a full charge. Initially without charge, I did a video stream and wanted to see how device shutdown. Sure enough it shut down as battery drained. Powered on after charging and everything was fine.I am impressed enough at the engineering for the price/value/budget it delivers. Cortex-A8 Processor is an ARM Cortex(tm)-A8 processor, based on the ARMv7 architecture, has the ability to scale in speed from 600MHz to greater than 1GHz. The Cortex-A8 processor can meet the requirements for power-optimized mobile devices needing operation in less than 300mW; and performance-optimized consumer applications requiring 2000 Dhrystone MIPS. This is from ARM specification. Pronto-Tec has pulled in many off the shelf components and assembled at a terrific value. I was particularly interested how it performs to streaming video. That is the golden test and it performed beautifully!", "Date": "April 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Dented and now a line through it", "Author": "Eshe", "ReviewID": "RYNZVNADIBK3L", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Hi, I purchased this as a gift for my husband, I received it today and the box was dented, however on opening the box it seemed as though everything was ok with the tab, not even 2 hours after opening it, a line showed up across the screen and the color on the screen is extremely is light and the brightness is turned all the way up. I am highly disappointed with this and I am lost at what I should do because not only my money is gone down the drain, my husband isn't able to use his gift. Can someone please help me????", "Date": "May 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not bad...", "Author": "Daniel B.", "ReviewID": "R3EPUFFFHPAMAS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off...  I would assume that price is the MAJOR factor in the purchase of this tablet.  I bought 2 of these primarily to entertain a 4,6&8 year old on the multiple road trips planned for this summer.I should preface this with the fact that I started out looking for a dual screen portable DVD player...  or even 2 individual dvd players.  For a similar price I got 2 of these.  With the SD slot we can use them for movies and more.They just arrived today, so this is completely based on my first hour or so of playing around with it.  I was weary when I made the purchase.  In the past I have purchased cheap electronics (mainly digital cameras) for the kids and they were garbage.  These surprisingly aren't garbage.  The screen does feel plastic, (which maybe will mean that it won't  shatter when it is inevitably dropped.)  The system does run slow.  The touch screen isn't as responsive as on a higher end tablet.  The screen isn't easily view-able from any angle other than straight on.  But on the bright side, once a game  is loaded, it runs fine.  Videos seem to run on it pretty well.  Although this is in now way competitive with a higher end tablet, it is a great kid friendly, cheap option.  Hopefully they will make our summer car trips endurable!", "Date": "May 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great for the price", "Author": "jimmarra", "ReviewID": "RHQT7ZEM1ZE0R", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "A bit slow and the screen is not that bright, but over all pretty good buy.

The game was Fruit Ninja HD, This game failed to load. I tried another game online that was not HD and it failed to load.
