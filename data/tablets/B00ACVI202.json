My girlfriend had just gotten an iPad 4 for Nursing School so I had something to compare it with.Let me say the screen is the pinnacle for tablets by far, just watch the planet earth HD episode that comes with. The pixel density is much better than the iPad but not as saturated, which is fine with me because it looks fake. The speakers set it apart from any tablet in terms of loudness and the fact they are front facing so you don't have to look like an idiot cupping the back of your tablet for people to hear. The camera is surprisingly good; auto focuses and takes photos very fast. Skype looks better on here than my laptop, not to mention its nice to use the back camera for a video tour, concert, etc. Its extremely fast with no hiccups that I've noticed (in 3 months). Frequent updates which is rare for a Android device. Coming from the Tegra 3 quad core processor on the Nexus 7, the dual core A15 1.9Ghz and Mali GPU on the 10 plays games just as well which is impressive for the best screen in tablets. Movies don't get any better. The absolute best video experience in tablets, I guarantee. As an engineering student, this device has been more than capable and helped me be organized and prepared for classes.Reasons why I like my Nexus 10 over my girlfriend's iPad 4:-better screen-front facing speakers-better multi-tasking-more customization-can open zips-can download attachments from sites that the iPad can-can use flash-can plug in any USB accessories with OTG cable (flash drive, mouse, keyboard, xbox controller) without installing anything or paying for over priced device specific accessories*iOS does have more tablet optimized apps but that's the OS and not the device itself. This tablet is hardware superior in every way and the OS is much more capable.", "Date": "March 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Now this is what I have been waiting for!", "Author": "Xandanga", "ReviewID": "R2QBA955IUIGM2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am an avid tablet user. I began with the original iPad and continued getting the Apple iterations on future launch days. Of course I was impressed with Apple's offerings but something just felt.. missing. I switched from using the iPhone 5 to the One X+ on AT&T; but returned that and got a Nexus 4 (which I also love). I feel that while Android may not have as many optimized apps, the Android OS is miles ahead of iOS in terms of functionality.So here I am with the iPad 4, bought just 7 months after I bought my iPad 3 (shouldn't these by at least a year apart??). I decided to jump ship and try out the Nexus 10. And boy, am I happy I did that!Pros:-Gorgeous display, in every way. Viewing angles are wide, text is crisp as can be and the contrast is stellar (from a tablet perspective, some phones are better).-Speed. This thing flies. No lag or observable hiccup anywhere. Coming from Android I definitely expected some hiccups or dropped frames, I was pleasantly surprised.-Weight. It is light-weight. I have no problem using this with one hand holding on from the middle while in landscape. I hardly ever use it in portrait.-Speakers. YES! I don't understand why anyone would ever choose to put speakers on the back. I love how the tablet looks with the speakers facing you and on both sides. Symmetry!-Gaming abilities. Every game I have tried runs flawlessly. Mind you, I place relatively simple games. No shooters or racing games here. Mostly puzzle, side scrolling and such. Spirit HD is my favorite game.-Browsing. While the bundled-in Chrome is lackluster in a number of areas, the AOSP is incredibly smooth. I notice no scolling lag or checkboards here, even when there is Flash on the page!-Battery life. Easily lasts two days of my moderate-high usage. Mainly browsing the web or something.-Updates. Since this is a Nexus tablet, you can be sure you will get timely updates to the OS.Cons:-Tablet optimized apps. This is just a shame, really. Most apps don't use the space effectively, I am hoping this changes since Google launched their own tablet.-Charging. Battery charges slowly, plus it actually loses power when I am playing a game and have it plugged in. Maybe a dock or magnetic plug in will charge it faster.-Chrome. The built-in browser is a huge let down. Consumers that are new to tablets will be very disappointed with this. Make sure to get a different browser from the market (Ocean Browser, Boat Browser).Overall, it is of my opinion that the pros heavily outweigh the cons.If you are in the market for a tablet, I would not hesitate to recommend this product. I am in love with it! This tablet is great and will only get better.", "Date": "January 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Review with Comparison to Note 10.1", "Author": "Ben", "ReviewID": "R1QW3HZA1OVGWQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I thought comparing both units and the Nexus 10 on its own would be a good idea, since many people ask themselves which to buy. Ill rate each area on a 0-5 scale, 5 being the best.Sound:Note 10.1 - 4.5Nexus 10 - 4.8Both units have great front facing speaking. They do both however lack good low-end. The Nexus edges ahead for being the louder of the 2, and having a clearer upper frequency range.Screen:Note 10.1 - 4.6Nexus 10 - 4.6They tie. I know that may seem weird, seeing as the Nexus has that great resolution and DPI, but read on. The resolution of the Nexus is GREAT. I used a few HD Space live wallpaper to compare, and WOW, they look great on the Nexus. My problem with the Nexus is colors are very washed out, on the Note 10.1 colors are very vibrant with deep saturation. When it comes to reading PDFs, Word, and internet browsing, both screens to about the same. Most websites are scaled for average, not high, resolutions. PDF/Docs are both very readable. There is a slight sharpness increase from the Nexus, but you have to really zoom in to see it. Games on both units perform well, but each has its ups and downs. The HD screen provides detail, but the washed our colors really show in HD games and the Note looks better in that regard. Unless youre truly using 1080p+ content, you wont really notice much difference. THe Nexus also has a bit of light bleed, while the Note doesnt.Construction:Note 10.1 - 4.2Nexus 10 - 4.8I should preface by saying, I have NO problem with plastic bodies. My problem with the Note is that the plastic feels very thin, and has a LOT of give, and can even \"crink\" when flexing. The Nexus 10 feels VERY solid, and the grippy texture on the back is great. If it wasnt for my Note being in a case, Id worry about it alot, the Nexus, less so. The buttons on the Nexus also seem better build, the are firm and have a good \"click\" when used.Performance (real world):Note 10.1 - 4.4Nexus 10 - 4.6The Nexus edges out ahead just a bit. The UI and app performance is consistently better. Its hard to say if thats because of the hardware or slight better hardware. The only area the Nexus struggled with was using ezPDF. For some reason turning pages made the Nexus skip frame rates, I'm would guess that the app more than the tablet. Games and Apps run great in both, but the Note SOMETIMES hiccups a bit, the Nexus has yet to.Battery Life:Note 10.1 - 4.8Nexus 10 - 4.6Both Units have great battery life when it comes to \"real world\" use. My Note lasts my 5ish days, while the Nexus last 3ish. Given the increased screen resolution being rendered and the higher clocked hardware, this is a reasonable tradeoff. Keep in mind these times were achieved with a tuned OS. Rooted with all unneeded services/programs disabled, and I run DS Battery saver on its most aggressive preset.Productivity:Note 10.1 - 4.9Nexus 10 - 4.3Its REALLY hard to beat the Note in productivity. Multi-window is great, S-pen for handwriting notes and drawing is unmatched.Misc:Note 10.1 - 4.4Nexus 10 - 4.6This is mostly how much work it takes to fully setup tablet as a power-user. Both devices root easily. The Note has MANY more services and bloatware to be tuned to really max out the performance of the OS. The Nexus, well thats pretty stock, so only a bit of trimming is required.Stability:Note 10.1 - 4.8Nexus 10 -4.8Updated to the latest OS on both, they both run great. Ive yet to have an OS lock, random reset, or had to hard reset on either. Both have gotten the occasional random app freeze, but its occasional and most likely the app, not the OS. Its worth noting both tablet to well at recovering from app freezes when they do happen, the OS never needs a hard reset.Storage:Note 10.1 - 4.9Nexus 10 - 4.8The Note wins out of box because it got a built in memory card slot. You can root the Nexus and buy an OTG cable and a USB card reader and get the same function. Its just one more step, and added cost though.So how do you choose between the 2?The Note right now is all about productivity. If youre a student looking to take digital notes, or looking for general productivity the Note wins hands down. I cant tell you the amount of times Ive pulled up a PDF, Word/Powerpoint doc side by side with Papyrus (my preferred note taking app). As a media device the Nexus is better. Music is louder and clearer, and movies in HD look great.If anyone would like anything else comparing side-by-side just ask, Id be happy to add it.", "Date": "May 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nexus 10 vs Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 vs ASUS Transformer T100TA", "Author": "drifter yank", "ReviewID": "R1PHP76RQO13HR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Over a period of several weeks I tried out the following.  (I will post this same review in Amazon under each device.)1. ASUS Transformer T100 hybrid tablet/notebook \u20282. Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 Tablet\u20283. Google Nexus 10 tabletI also looked at an iPad Air.  They are way overpriced.  And I still have a grudge against Apple for the 2012 hard drive recall they had on our 27\" iMac.  It was a total disaster.  We didn't lose any data but it took weeks and endless phone calls to get it running right again.After spending a day getting used to Windows 8, I thought the ASUS might be the one I was going to keep.  I actually only tried it for two days.  Early on day three I shut it down only to have it remain on the \"Shutting Down\" screen for an extended time period.  So I powered it off.  Apparently, my bad.  Subsequently it would not reboot into Windows, reset or repair even after talking with ASUS Tech Support.  They asked me to return it to them for repair.  I declined and returned it to WallyWorld.I liked the ASUS.  It was attractive but a fingerprint magnet both front and back. And it was more difficult to use than Android.  The two issues that bothered me most were the lack of a Swype app and the complications of dictation.  The best Swype-type app in the Windows Store is TouchPal.  It ain't that good.  First of all the virtual keyboard is large. Your finger has to cover a lot of real estate to enter characters.  Also, the word prediction accuracy sucks. Windows-supported dictation was not that accurate, so I had to go into Google to dictate.  This was not nearly as handy as being in a Google operating system to begin with.  I use Swype and dictation a lot.The mentioned issues relate to Windows 8 not the physical unit.  I liked the ASUS unit enough that I discovered they make several similar models running Android.  After checking these out I found they were either running old versions of Android or cost a couple of hundred dollars more than the two Samsung models mentioned here.  So, that ended that.It was hard to choose between the Nexus and the Galaxy,  Both are made by Samsung.  I waited several weeks to see if a new Nexus 10 was coming out but to no avail.As far as looks go, the Galaxy is very thin and attractive.  In my opinion it is as nice looking as an iPad even though it has more plastic.  I had the white one so fingerprints were not that visible.  The Galaxy gets compliments for its narrow bezels.  However these are really a functional negative. They cause you to touch and activate stuff on the screen accidentally quite often.  Makes me suspect the iPad has the same problem.  There are a lot of complaints about the large area of sensitivity for the three built-in keys at the bottom of the Galaxy.  However I thought this was minor compared to the narrow side bezels.  (You can probably negate the side bezel problem by putting the unit in a folio case. It could give you more to hang onto.) The speakers are on the top of the sides and are easy to cover up when holding the unit.Though made by Samsung, because Google's name is on it the Nexus is first in line for Android updates. It has already downloaded the latest Android version, KitKat.  It will also be the first to get future updates since there is no manufacturer software OS overlay to wait for.  It is pure Android--no bloatware.  In terms of specs, the Nexus blows the other two units away.  The broad bezels may not be as attractive but they give you something to hang onto without accidental screen touches.  The Nexus' rubber-like coating on the back is better for grip and not a fingerprint magnet.  Less bling but more practical. The Nexus' speakers are on the on the front, the best place.Even though I did not keep the Galaxy and its specs are much less impressive than the Nexus, I found it perfectly satisfactory for my needs.  I do mainly Web browsing, Email, some text and spreadsheet documents and a few non-graphic intensive games. I bought all of these units from local big box stores.  The Nexus 10 was $400 and the two Samsung units were only about $30 less.After considerable researching of portable Bluetooth keyboards, I ordered and just received a Kensington KeyFolio Pro 2 Universal Case and Keyboard.  I bought this from Amazon and will review it when I have had it for awhile.  So far this looks like a terrific and attractive accessory  I will probably keep the Nexus in the protective case without the keyboard most of the time.  I will use the keyboard when I do a lot of data entry.", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Beautiful Screen Buggy Software", "Author": "J. M Nevins", "ReviewID": "R2BR3O56OV9DXQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought the Nexus 7 for travel and liked it so much that I decided to buy the Nexus 10 to use at home. The Nexus 10 screen was gorgeous, Jelly Bean 4.2 had lots of neat features and the build quality was excellent so I quickly learned to love my new tablet.  That is until it started misbehaving.  It began with Chrome becoming unresponsive to touch inputs followed by a spontaneous complete shutdown and eventually a reboot.  Once it had rebooted, I continued to use it but Chrome kept on freezing up to the point of being unusable. I did some research on the web and discovered that these behaviors were common with the Nexus 10 and the latest version of Jelly Bean. So I reset the device to factory defaults in preparation for a return.  However, the next morning I hated the thought of returning the tablet because it was so nice minus the software/hardware hiccups so I reinstalled all my apps and updated them all in the hope that maybe the bad behavior was a fluke.  Not so.  Chrome began locking up again so I reluctantly returned the Nexus 10. I am disappointed but I am willing to give the next Nexus 10 a chance, hopefully with less buggy software because the rest of the experience was very positive.", "Date": "January 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "To buy or not to buy that is the question!", "Author": "Al Dante", "ReviewID": "R2DP1BV3EB2BX4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Originally I posted a long history of the Nexus 10 and updated it once. Now that I have used it for a while I will condense it into something easier by eliminating everything I said before and just getting to it:1. A tablet will NOT replace a laptop for web surfing. The Nexus 10 does a darn good job of being a backup internet source but for having to type in web pages, etc, its not that user friendly so you will really need a laptop for home use and this for travel or other.2. Google Play, the online store equivalent of Amazon, is worlds ahead of Amazon is usefulness and ease of use. Searching for books, music, movies is a snap. Everything is loaded into their cloud but you can PIN things to be actually downloaded to your Nexus for like using on a plane withoug Wifi availability.3. I already know that this is going to be great to travel with versus lugging a laptop around. I'm taking books, movies, all my music in one small package. You can also use if for e-ticketing, to travel with an electronic boarding pass.4. Uploading your own music is a piece of cake. Picture is bright and clear. Reading is effortless, and the sound of the music player is impressive. You can easily hear the speakers from 25 feet away so its not toy but its not your surround system either!Last, knowing what I know now, I wish I would have bought the Nexus 7 and 10 instead of the 10 and the Kindle Paperwhite. Again, searching for books in Amazon is like having teeth pulled.

Google has made the right calls in term of aesthetics and industrial design, while Samsung was able to bring the best hardware to the game. The display is beautiful and the system has enough muscles to handle any media you throw at it.The most surprising aspect of the Google Nexus 10 is the price: At $399 (16GB, WiFi), the Google Nexus 10 is significantly cheaper than Apple's iPad 4 which beats it only in polygonal graphics. This is a very aggressive pricing, especially if you think that this powerful tablet costs a mere $70 more than the iPad mini which is far less potent.If you want a tablet for basic things like email, web, gaming and apps, this is the best option for now. It is both cheaper and better than most of the competition. There are a few exceptions: if you want a stylus, the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 is a better alternative, and if you need Microsoft Office compatibility, the Microsoft Surface RT would be better.

This 10\" tablet from Google is fantastic! Compared with my other one, Nexus is fast, the new Jelly Bean o/s is simple, intuitive, and fast. Somehow the Internet speed is truly faster than other new tablets including several Asus, Samsung, and iPad models that some of my friends have. The screen is absolutely incredible: video comes in crystal clear and smooth; there is no lag. Stunning!With all the praise, there are always areas of improvement and truthfully I wish I could give it 4-1/2 stars: 1. navigation bar takes real estate: while the new o/s is smooth, the navigation is now always on the screen, 2. the tablet is a bit heavy: you really have to squeeze it tight to hold it along the side with one hand (as I am often trying to do), 3. volume rocker is backwards: I am usually holding the tablet in portrait orientation with the power and volume toward the top, but then you have to hit the rocker up to turn the volume down, perhaps it was designed by a lefty, 4. lack of expansion: I know Google's whole mission is your life on the web, but occasionally, I need to transfer data and don't have an internet connection, I would really love a microSD port (also I could buy a 16GB card less than the $100 premium I paid for the 32GB version of this tablet).Overall, I would certainly recommend this to anyone looking for a good solid tablet with a superior display.", "Date": "February 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best Android tablet", "Author": "Barb\u0113l\u014d", "ReviewID": "R3CZW73X9S5I4N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have an iPad 3 and this Nexus is just as user friendly and the battery lasts just as long, if not slightly longer.Because the Nexus is a Proper Android device being Googles own tablet, the O.S gets the latest updates a lot quicker than any other device.I needed an Android Tablet for all my Apps that I got from Amazon that I couldn't play properly on the Kobo Vox....When my son mentioned to me about the Nexus 7 I was interested yes! but then in the Kindle Forums someone told me about the Nexus 10 coming and when I realised it was a Samsung tablet I wanted it there and then.I kept the Google playStore page up refreshing it every few hours, until about 2 weeks later luckily the Nexus came available.Ordered it straight away on the Sunday Evening and by Tuesday Morning I was connecting the WiFi....it came that quick I was really and truly amazed. The service I had from Google was outstanding, the after sales.....having a Free Phone Number to help me setting everything up and they talked very clear which I was really pleased about.I was extremely pleased how Google had set the tablet up to be so clear, it's really user friendly.The Nexus is such a beautiful device, so smart and the touch screen is so responsive.Because I got it direct from Google themselves I managed to get the 32GB, but it's a shame that you cannot add a Memory card into the device.The speakers are a tiny bit quiet for my liking, but you can actually get an app from Amazon  Speaker Boost  so you can play your music just like its got surround sound.

I still use my iPad, but I'm so overwhelmed with this device....you can't buy any better in my opinion and its so comfortable holding it in your hand to play games or reading.  I could actually keep praising the Nexus because I love it so much and the fact that you can store all your music, books and games in the cloud from Amazon and Google I am using the Nexus all of the time, maybe a tiny bit more than the iPads.If someone told me about a year ago how much I would be using an Android device today I would never of  believed them because back then I was never comfortable with Android, but they have come on Massively over the past year.I did originally buy a case for the Nexus, but I found it to be too heavy so I have removed it out of the case and now I am hoping that I can get an sleeve to protect it when I carry the Nexus in my bag.Because the Nexus 10 is so slim, I have got it in my dressing gown pocket so I can listen to my music whilst I'm walking around the house doing other things at the same time....I never thought I would be able to that with such a big device like this, but that's because it's so light and slim  like I mentioned.September 19th 2013**************************I have now in my hand, the new Nexus 7 32GB  also bought direct from Google Play and within less than 36hrs of me pressing the buy-now button.

I've been quite happy with my Nexus 10 for a month now.  4.2.1 does have random hard resets and force closes, mostly related to Chrome and Google Now (I'll be upset if this isn't updated by March).  The machine is almost as snappy as my Samsung SIII with Jelly Bean.  The back feels velvety smooth like the back of the Playbook, and the front speakers are loud and provide good sound - I rarely reach for my Jambox with this thing.  The back can be scratched, so I would recommend a Poetic Case.  When I originally moved from the Tab, I found that the colors on the Nexus 10 were inferior.  I don't notice it anymore.  Also, the battery life is reduced from the Tab.  I get about 8 hours. The only real question for me going into this tablet, was whether I would buy the Nexus 7 or 10.

The design. I like it. A sleek exterior, soft touch grip, nice stereo speakers, etc. So far I'm happy. Then I boot her up. First thing I notice, which happens to be one of the main features, the dazzling 300 ppi display. Amazing. No blurry text, no blur anywhere. Then I slide down the notification bar see that it has 80 percent battery. Very happy. No \"initial charge\" that takes 20 years.  Nice. Clean interface,  instant connection with Wi Fi, everything I see is something I just need, love, or prefer, Everything.So, that is the story my first thoughts about my new tablet. Now some tips to the new Nexus 10 user.1 Get Nexus Media Importer. Even before system updates. The 4 dollars, plus 3 for a otg connector, are SO worth it.2 Next is a system update. Try to get 4.3 or newer.3 This one is obvious, but get yourself a case. And a Bluetooth keyboard. You'll need it for any kind of productivity.I will update with more info.Update 1: I have found a couple of minor gripes with the tablet.1. The notification bar is not accessible from all appsE.x while playing Sonic Jump, the notification bar is impossible to see until you close the app2. Because of the ultra ultra ultra high res screen, the battery life is between a half hour and hour and a half less than anIPad. But then again nothing really beats the iPad with battery life.3. This is being extremely nitpicking, but the Nexus's screen seems to have SLIGHTLY muted colors. Remember, EXTREME nitpickers will notice this.I feel that the minor con's are all far away from being deal breakers. Tablet is still the best.Update #2: I brought this with me on a recent week trip. I have to say, my overall experience was good, but not perfect. I used it to watch a movie with others. The movie played perfectly fine and was SUPER high quality. The definition was ridiculous, and the viewing angles are amazing. However, when I took pictures while sightseeing, the photos were just average.

So since that was a dual core chip I figured I'd look for a quad core tablet. The Transformer Prime was faster with its quad core chip but had I/O issues so it could not multitask. I hoped that they would have resolved it with the newer Transformer Infinity but the same super slow I/O issues were there preventing it from being a multi tasking tablet. So I finally gave the Nexus 10 a try. I was hesitant at first because the Nexus 10 is a Dual core tablet... I wondered how it could possibly stand up to the Quad core tablets but the newer A15 chipset in the Nexus 10 blows the other tablets away.The screen is the best I've seen on any computer or tablet and the zippiness of the tablet is incredible. I there is no lag at all between a touch gesture and movement on the screen. There is no stuttering during multitasking. The sound is incredible from the 2 front facing speakers, and i still cant get over the screen.Its pretty easy to unlock or root with plenty of links out there for one click roots if that your thing.I would highly recommed this tablet as the only viable iPad alternative for someone looking for more control over thier tablet and at a lower cost.", "Date": "May 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Google gets it right", "Author": "G.

I use the 3rd generation iPad at work daily; have owned the third generation iPad which I sold; and own an Asus Transformer TF-101 for playing on at home.  Jelly bean was not coming to that particular model so I decided to try the Nexus 10.  After using the Nexus 10 for a month I am very happy I did.  It is very quick even in comparison with the iPad.  The apps I run on it run without hesitation and I have had few hangups though I believe those few to be app problems that will fixed in future updates.  The feel is good; it is thin and light but also feels sturdy.  The resolution is superb though I agree with the color problems I have read about.  For most people using this for light business applications or gaming or just checking email that will not be an issue.  Watching movies I could not really notice a color problem.  If you are using this for photo-proofing or something similar it could be.  The only real issues I have other than the color is the lack of expansion slot for a micro SD card to expand the memory and the wi-fi is not consistent, which I have noticed on other Android tablets.

One of the things that drew me to this choice were the front facing speakers, a rarity on a tablet. And that was one of my first disappointments. While the audio is fine on games and other media, the audio volume for the videos I stream via Netflix and my Xfinitey provider is extremely low, almost to the point where I can't hear dialog without either getting real close or plugging in headphones.

I used a tablet primarily for my college classes (Ebooks, PowerPoint slides, PDF notes, homework, etc), but now I use it more than my laptop.  For school alone, the TF300T was good enough...but now I needed something more powerful and faster. So I decided to get the N10. One week in and here are my results:GOOD: The high resolution display of the Nexus 10 is beautiful to behold as well as its smoothness of the OS. High graphic games as well as memory intensive apps run with such fluidity and ease. The speed of the N10 is nothing short of amazing...from web surfing to reading articles to playing games, the speed at which every task is done is superb. The sound quality is to be expected with a tablet...not mind-blowing but good enough for the tasks needed.  The dual speakers is an added bonus as a way to bring in some sort of stereo sound.BAD: 2 issues I found...the WiFi connection seems to flicker when an app, such as a MMORPG, constantly uses the connection. It drops the connections in some instances.  There is an app that fixes this issue (WiFi Fixer is its name), but I rather see this problem taken care of through Google instead of having to get an app to do so. The auto-brightness sensor is hit-or-miss when it comes to screen brightness...sometimes it works extremely well and other times the brightness fluctuates randomly when I transition from light to dark (or vice versa). A simple fix for that is to simply turn off auto-brightness in settings.Overall I am really impressed with this tablet. If you can get through those 2 issues, the N10 is a great tablet.By the way, I don't discriminate between brands...I choose what I consider is best for my tastes. By no means am I a fanboy of any product or OS.

My most recent problem has been using the panoramic mode; when taking photos in panoramic mode by battery life goes from 100% charged to 0%. I contacted Google about the issue and they stated that I would need to contact the manufacturer which is Samsung since I did not purchase my Nexus 10 from the Google Store.

Each time I spoke to a representative they wanted me to provide my phone number, full name, area code, and email address which i stopped doing after the 5th transfer, instead I would ask the representative if this was the NEXUS 10 department and the representative would tell that it wasn't and they would transfer me to the \"RIGHT\" department that could help me with with my issue. It was extremely annoying and disappointing that I couldn't get any help after 25 minutes of being on the phone with customer service and after being transferred one last time the automated system ended the call. I called back after the call was ended and once again I was transferred back and forth I then spoke to an Omar who stated that he only worked in the laptop department, a Rachel who then transferred me to a Barry, this Barry was supposedly the person that would be able to help me but he too transferred me to the \"NEXUS 10 WIFI ONLY DEPARTMENT\" after 19 minutes the automated system ended the call.

When it arrived, it was running Android 4.2 and I couldn't get it to update to 4.4. I tried updating manually but I couldn't get that to work either. Eventually I connected it via usb to the computer and it updated automatically at that point. So if you're having trouble updating, try connecting to a computer with the usb and leaving it for a bit; it will probably update OTA (over the air) at that point.The tablet was buggy as a box of bees until the upgrade - turned off when put to sleep, youtube, google music, google video all nonfunctioning - but once it updated it was like a new machine. It now works perfectly. The display is gorgeous and it's fairly light for the size; I have a Kindle paperwhite for extensive reading of epubs (which I love), but my eyes aren't great so this tablet's size is terrific for pdfs. Of course, you can't beat it for video or web surfing.Reasons why I love this tablet more than my stolen ipad: 1) lower price for similar specs; 2) can use mini-usb/usb connector to access a flash drive (why are people complaining about the lack of an SD card?); 3) can use apps to customize, particularly being able to dim display all the way down for low-light conditions; 4) compatible with adobe flash, at least in certain circumstances.I haven't found battery life to be a problem, but it can be improved by turning off bluetooth, GPS (location), and NFC data exchange if you're not using them and dimming the screen.Overall, performance on the Nexus 10 is fantastic and it compares favorably with the iPad 2 in all respects. It's not the end-all tablet for everyone.

I bought my husband a nice big HP laptop for Christmas in 2012 and he doesn't use it much anymore since he got this tablet. 5. I also bought him a JAM wireless bluetooth speaker which was so easy to pare to this tablet.  6. I also bought him a bluetooth wireless keyboard and a stand for this exact model tablet and he loves the whole package!!!!The only thing I regret is that I may have created a monster. It would be easier to give birth than to try to get this tablet away from my husband. And OH yeah, his co-workers are quite jealous of him!!!!!!!", "Date": "January 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Google nexus 10", "Author": "Amanda McMahon", "ReviewID": "R1M0YLUU0N5TBE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Couldn't be happier with a purchase. I bought this tablet as a gift and everyone in the house LOVES it.With the multi user pages it makes everyone feel like they have their space.I ended up buying different things that just keeps me being amazed with the capabilities you can do on here.Otg(on the go) cable- a $3.00 buy that allows me  to use my everyday usb . it also allows you to plug in a controller from a gaming system. Enhancing game play tremendously.HDMI cable- a $4.00 buy allows you to mirror your tablet on you TV. Play apps on the TV, watch movies from yourTablet on your tv. My wife uses it at work to give presentations.Keyboard- I bought a Bluetooth but you don't need to. I do school work on kingsoft app and type my papers instead of using a desktop, so I would recommend only if typing is something you'll be doing often. If not the swipe typing works perfect.All in all I am very happy with this tablet. The only Con I can try to come up with is how long it takes to charge the battery. Altlongh the battery lasts long, to recharge it fully to 100% takes forever.

O.", "ReviewID": "RCA075IUSJU03", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this tablet back in April 2013 from a local retailer. It runs all desired applications without issue, but when the battery drops below 50%, the wireless begins cutting out with frustrating regularity, around three or four times a minute for around two to five seconds each time. I purchased this tablet for use as a productivity and entertainment tool, and while it mostly succeeds at the former, it fails pretty miserably at the latter. I would be able to let this issue go if it didn't occur while the tablet is plugged in, but since the stock charger doesn't charge the device fast enough to keep up with the power output while watching streaming video, it persists until I stop using it and let it charge to 100%. I have attempted to reset the device to factory defaults several times, and I have spoken with Samsung support on three separate occasions. It was sent in for maintenance one time and the only actions performed according to the ticket were to reload the software, which essentially boils down to performing a factory reset again. Two more calls after that and they offered to let me send it back in for more maintenance since the manufacturer's warranty does not cover replacement. I should also mention at this point that my wireless network can be ruled out as I have a large number of other wireless devices of different types, including three other tablets from different manufacturers, that do not have any issues. After looking online for a while I noticed that while this problem doesn't occur on all Nexus 10 tablets, it occurs on enough of them that I would say your best bet would be to find a different Android tablet like the Nexus 7, or go with an iPad if you're on the fence about Android vs. iPad. I personally prefer Android tablets over iPads due to the more open developer platform, but for people just looking for a device for entertainment and productivity, either is really fine. It is important to mention that there are reports that Google is dropping Samsung as the manufacturer of the Nexus 10 and switching over to Asus, the company that produces the Nexus 7. I have heard very few complaints about the Nexus 7, so if you want the 10 inch Google sponsored tablet, wait until around Christmas of 2013 and buy the one manufactured by Asus.", "Date": "October 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "May be a great item, but terrible customer support", "Author": "Stephanie Seifert", "ReviewID": "R23GMGP3AIVHUC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Update 1/7/13: After hours spent on the phone with various customer support reps from Google, Samsung, and, my ISP, as well as more than twice that time reading Android and Nexus forums, I have tried every solution offered. Nothing has worked. The tablet works great on free wifi everywhere I go, but it will not work on our home network. Google support has a list of about 6 routers that will not work with Nexus devices, but mine is not on there. Otherwise, it says \"most\" home routers will work. If you have a Cisco WRT160N, please be aware you will likely have the same problems I have had.We have checked and changed the frequency of the router, unplugged and plugged the router, changed.the router SSID to be all one lowercase word, changed the frequency on the tablet, told the tablet to forget our network,  set the tablet to use a static IP rather than DHCP, done a firmware update on the router, and done a factory restore of the router, all multiple times and in all combinations. Nothing has worked.All the issues I was having are known issues both for Android devices in general and Nexus devices specifically and have been discussed in forums repeatedly since early 2011, so I'm not sure why Google doesn't seem to be training its support reps (who don't seem to know anything particular about the tech involved) about these issues.Original review:I received one of these tablets for Christmas and was unable to get on to the internet after accessing our wifi. Terrible customer service from Google. The second person finally told me it was a defective device and would have to be returned to Walmart. For days, we waited after returning it, because no one had the device in stock. Finally, I get a brand-new device...and have the same issue. I have spoken to THREE customer support people today. Google needs to train their people better. I told them the problem, told them all the steps I'd been through with every other person I'd spoken to, and they ALL insisted on going through all the steps again. One of the times, I even called with a possible solution...I just had to know where one setting was on the machine...and I never got that answer. I was repeatedly told to make sure my router was broadcasting 2.4gHz because this device will operate only on that. And then I discovered by playing in the device's settings that that is FALSE. The default setting is auto, but you can specify 2.4gHz or 5.0gHz. One of their solutions to check my connection was to have me connect to another wifi network. I live in the country, so this is impossible unless I make a trip to a neighbor's house or a town. Apparently, the folks at Google don't realize that there are people still living without being surrounded by wifi. After resetting my router twice, shutting it down numerous times, and calling my ISP so I could tell the Google people that the ISP has assured me that our internet connection is fine (they don't believe the three other computers and two gaming consoles) that were currently connected, I have finally decided I don't want a Nexus 10 or any other Google device. It's not worth the trouble, apparently.

I also purchased a 24\" widescreen TV, a video HDMI cable adapter, a logitech bluetooth keyboard, a microsoft bluetooth mouse, a micro usb OTG cable and a POGO cable charger.  First the good.  When I first turned on the tablet, it quickly took me through the steps of customizing the system for my connections.  It downloaded all of the apps that I am using on my android phone and connected me with my google account.  The screen is awesome - very sharp and responsive.  The tablet is responsive.  The tablet quickly had me update my android software to the latest 4.4.2 android release.  A particular use for the tablet was to perform the digitization of my large LP collection.  I found a replacement in the app store for the famous audacity desktop sound mixing software - Audio Evolution Mobile and a USB Audio Recorder app for interfacing to a USB audio device.  I was able to interface to my Rega Fono Mini phone preamp/analogue to digital converter through the USB port using this driver.  I am now happily converting my LP's to wave files with this app and then converting them to MP3's for listening on my digital devices.  I also downloaded the Kingsoft Office and the AndroOpen Office apps for microsoft compatible wordprocessing, spreadsheets and powerpoint editing and creation.  I found an app to perform automatic synchronization with my dropbox account of select folders on the nexus and also an app that would mount a memory stick for read/write access.  Finally, I found an app that would allow me to print to my wireless brother printer which was not compatible with the included google cloud print or HP Print Service app.  In addition to several other apps that I use for various asundry things, I basically had everything I needed to perform the basic functions I had been doing on my old desktop plus I now had tremendous mobility and flexibility.  I have been quite happy with all of this.  I purchased the tablet when google and amazon dropped the price on the tablet by $50 in order to clear out their remaining inventory.  I don't believe you can find the 32 Gbyte version available from either amazon or google now.Now the bad.  The tablet charges extremely slowly.  I had read beforehand that the POGO cable charger would charge the tablet much faster than the included USB charger.  However, it has proven to be only marginally faster.  If the tablet becomes fully discharged, plan to take the entire night to recharge the tablet to full capacity.  In addition, there are times when I have been using the tablet while it is charging and still lost ground on the available charge on the battery!  However, when fully charged, I can usually get about 6 - 8 hours of use by keeping the screen turned down to a reasonable level and adjusting the synch rates of google mail and other services.  Another problem is the bluetooth system.  I cannot have the wifi (2.4 Ghz) up and connected while using both the bluetooth mouse and keyboard simultaneously.  The keyboard kind of goes haywire.  If I disconnect the bluetooth mouse and instead use a usb mouse (or no mouse), everything is ok.  If I disconnect wifi, I can use both the bluetooth mouse and keyboard without a problem.  Some investigation on the internet revealed that this is a problem on nexus devices going back to Android 4.2 when Google introduced an entirely new bluetooth \"stack.\"  It appears that they have not been able to fix this problem.  A few times, I have had a random reboot.  I have probably suffered a random reboot about half a dozen times in the two months I have been using the tablet.Overall, I have to say the experience has been positive.  I would give this tablet 4 or 5 stars if the serious bugs I mentioned above did not exist.

I was hesitant to accept the unit so I documented the receipt condition. The unit itself appeared absolutely pristine and brand new.That said I have had no issues with the tablet in the month that i have owned it and plan to keep it barring any irresolvable issues.I purchased the tablet for media consumption - YouTube, Netflix, sharing photos and videos. I am not using it for work so productivity is secondary for me. The tablet excels at media consumption - Netflix runs perfect, YouTube is great and photos look fabulous. Some have complained about the screen colors being somewhat dull and washed out (compared to an IPad). I have not found this to be an issue at all - movies and photos look more natural as a result. If you need more punch just turn up the screen brightness. The display is drop dead gorgeous.Battery charging is slow (I did not buy accessory charger) but is quite manageable - I just plug it in overnight every 2-3 days and I'm good to go. I haven't checked battery life but it has not been an issue for me.Pure Android! My tablet immediately updated to 4.3 then 4.4 (now running 4.4.2) and pulled in all my apps from Google Play store without incident. I don't miss the bloat ware!Connectivity is great - WIFI connects immediately and stays connected. I am able to tether to my RAZR with FoxFi (yes i did purchase the app) and connection speeds are quite fast as I have no trouble streaming YouTube HD when tethered. Also (and this is GREATTT), Roku just released a YouTube app within the last 2 weeks that allows me to 'beam' my YouTube playlist from my tablet to my home theater system. Whatever I punch in on the tablet is now on the home theater.This thing is FAST - scrolling is butter smooth, no hiccups, no waiting. The thing just flat out flies! I've had no freezes, crashes or random reboots (I am using dolphin browser - rather than Chrome). It's been rock solid so far.One of the things that differentiated this table from the others I was considering is the front facing speakers. They put out a surprising amount of sound (depending on the program material) with a fairly good sound field. I didn't expect a lot of bass and that is the case. The speakers are quite adequate for the job.I looked at the surface and Asus transformer infiniti. The surface was ruled out on cost and Microsoft does not have the ecosystem that android has (my phone is android RAZR). I am one of the few (apparently) that likes Windows 8 (have 2 Win 8 laptops) but I find it cumbersome to move files from the Windows system to the Android system. So I went with Android based tablet. What turned me off on the Asus was the single rear facing speaker, overpriced, and still running ice cream sandwich. I waited for the price to drop on the Asus for a year and it didn't budge! So when the price dropped on the Nexus 10 I went for it.I was expecting to be disappointed with the camera - I am not! Granted I have not tested it in difficult lighting (mixed artificial light sources, high dynamic range etc) but what I have seen so far is that the tablet does a good job of getting the exposure and white balance correct. Videos are crisp and well exposed. It won't replace your DSLR (maybe not your smart phone camera either) but nonetheless has proved quite useful and handy.That back has a rubbery material which I find a bit slippery in my hands. The tablet is very thin and light. I purchased a Fintie folio and stand combination. It protects the tablet and puts it to sleep when closed.

Fast, easy to use, long battery life. Some have said that charging is slow, but I really don't think it's that bad. I have also read that it will not charge while playing a game, as it goes down faster than charging, but that is no reason not to plug it in while using it. I run it heavy for 1 to 2 days before charging over night. Android 4.3 is really nice, because you can have multiple user profiles. This is important for the kids so that they have independent saved game positions (they fight a lot about this on the DSiXL, Wii, and Nook). The rubber back makes it easy to hang on to. It is great for netflix, and even dlna streaming. I use it for too many things to list here. However, it is WiFi only, and does not have an SD slot. For this, I recommend getting the 32GB version, and signing up for things like DropBox or Google Drive (both free). For mobile internet connectivity, I just tether to my Samsung Galaxy Note 2, and use the 4G, which works really well. The Google Nexus is actually made by Samsung, so it is a good product. It does also have Bluetooth, NFC, HDMI out, and a standard micro USB charging port. There is another charging port on the bottom for a \"quick charger\". It is also compatible with several bluetooth keyboard covers, and I even use a bluetooth netbook mouse with it. It's almost like a notebook at that point.

Whether true or not, it appeared to me that the Kindle Fire only allowed you to download from the Amazon store. I received the Nexus 10 as a gift a few weeks ago. It had been purchased at Google Play, rather than Amazon, where I ordinarily shop. I wanted a 10\" tablet because it's a good form factor for reading magazines and watching movies. Magazines are going digital and a tablet is going to become a necessity for reading magazines sooner rather than later. I particularly wanted a tablet for the New Yorker. When I first received it, a New Yorker app wasn't available, but happily that changed within a week of my tablet's arrival. The New Yorker app is great, though it doesn't yet allow me to access the New Yorker archives. The screen is clear and sharp. The Wi-Fi is fast, at least compared to my HTC EVO phone. Netflix works great with it. It seems well put together. I like the surface of the back which provides some adhesion, so I never feel that it will slip out of my hands. As a calendar and email reader it's as good as a computer. The battery often last three days. Some people say that a 10 inch tablet is too large and heavy for holding while you read. I haven't found this to be the case, though it is a little unwieldy for carrying around. I bought the Google cover for it to protect the screen. It was easy to install and what I like best is when I open the cover the tablet wakes up and when I close the cover it goes to sleep.

A lot of the high points listed have been problems recently remedied by the new kernel update.-The screen is incredibly sharp at such a high DPI.-Thin and just light enough to comfortably hold with one hand. The plastic body feels just slightly low-rent, but it's a solid device.-2 gigs of ram that is readily used. I see very little (if any) reloading with nearly every app except for Chrome. I can, literally, play two games at once and have Google currents going with no problems.-The processor screams and things are very fast now (lag has been readily reduced for me with the new update).-Unlocked bootloader makes it very easy to install custom roms. I honestly don't feel much of a need for this now like with most android devices.-My battery life is substantially better. Something like 8 or 9 hours of screen time. I find this perfectly acceptable and really think I could eek out more if I wasn't really hounding the thing.The Bad:-Android has some growing pains. Being first for Google updates is really resolving a lot of the performance inconsistencies on Nexus devices. Phone apps scale fairly well, but in the last month I've noticed that nearly every app I use is tablet optimized. It's not close to the iOS ecosystem yet, but core functionality is there for me.-I have never had any luck with auto-brightness on this thing. I'm using an app and the camera sensor to get comfortable automatic brightness switching.-Some light leak on the display. It happens with this type of device and is a small amount in the corner that I rarely notice. While everything looks sharp, I'd prefer colors to be a bit more saturated.-Chrome is freaking terrible on android tablets. Using Chrome Beta has been a God send and it's obvious that they are working on the performance issues. Honestly, it's just shameful that they would integrate a browser that's horrendously slow, draws pages poorly, and crashes the entire OS.-USB 2.0 charging is just plain slow. Prepare to wait for it to charge overnight.-I'm not a fan of the unified UI. If you use an Android phone it's very similar and uses the navigation buttons can be a PITA (now, they are centered instead of on the corner).Conclusion: 4.2.2 has really sorted this thing out. It is phenomenally responsive and manages to eek out great battery life. Google Play is finally pushing tablet apps and the functionality of Android lets me manage my media server, files, and remote computer sessions without an issue.

It's fast, sleek, and everything I'd ever want in a tablet experience.  Various family members have owned numerous generations of the iPad and while it does not always have the reliable, seamless fluidity that the Apple branded products are known for, it's damn near close.My only issues are that after prolonged use, the battery heats up tremendously.  You could fry an egg on the back of this thing after 20-30 minutes of normal, non-video-intensive use.  I'm not kidding here.  This thing could double as a hot plate.  Also, the battery life tends to tank if you use it for longer than 30 minutes at a time.  This could be a normal thing that all tablets have, since I'm not too familiar with what is the norm these days for these beefier, more capable devices.  The battery life seems entirely dependent on the temperature that the battery reaches each time I use it.  If I use it for 5-10 minutes and the battery doesn't heat up to temperatures the surface of the sun would be jealous of, I get much more life out of the device per charge than if I would do the same tasks with the tablet for 30 minutes straight, heating up the battery to scalding temperatures.

I have never been happy with any of them.  They all had shortcomings...until now.  I ordered the Nexus 10 after convincing myself that it looked and sounded like what it was I really found important and wanted in a tablet.  Boy!  I was not wrong.  I have been using the Nexus 10 for a couple of weeks now and can report that this tablet is fantastic in every way.  The screen is quite remarkable.  It is fast!Also, it has the best keyboard and touch that I have found on any of those other tablets.  The Pad-thing could learn something here...and I am sure they will probably update its keyboard since that is one of the big trouble spots I found with my iPad 2,3, and 4.  The newest android system is quite easy to get around...and, did I say this was fast?????  I mean smoking fast.  Others have said the iPad has nothing to worry about from the Nexus....really?  Give it time.I use my Nexus for productive (school) uses, surfing the Internet, email and social media.  I love, love, love this tablet.  I bought the 32 due to restrictive expansion (sounds familiar doesn't it?).  If you're in the market...please consider checking out the Nexus.  I bought a \"refurb\" unit that was fulfilled by Amazon for a really decent price and it looks brand spanking new (probably really is).  Also purchased a magnetic cover and screen protector that was easy to install...just followed directions.  Total package = excellent.UPDATE:  6/8/13I was wrong.  My initial feelings and vibes reported above were a bit premature.  My patience was put to the test this week, and, as of today, the Nexus 10 is going back.  This entire week, the Nexus 10 started acting \"funny\".  It was surprisingly sluggish - much more than when I first got it, and I didn't add but a couple of apps that were pretty lame and should not have impacted performance.  Then I started getting the lock-ups which needed the hard reboots that a lot of folks talk about.  Finally, today, even when using Chrome (Google's own search engine!), things just would not load...at all.  I tried using Dolphin and still nothing.  Enough is enough.  Between the slow responses, hard reboots required daily, and now search engine issues when I try to surf anywhere - I am calling it quits on the Nexus...white flag is going up the pole.  I am very disappointed as I really did think this was \"the one\"!  I still think that once the bugs get worked out, I will be all in since I just loved this machine.  The feel, the looks, the keyboard, the interface....the entire package was great, but the frustrating features were too much and I can't tolerate such things.

It's that bad.You need a GOOD adapter (my Samsung one was actually dead out of the box - likely because I bought a refurbed Nexus 10), and a POGO cable to get a good charging speed. I'm waiting on a new OEM charger before passing final judgement - but I can tell you, the AmazonBasics 2.1a charger is not fast enough.

The display alone is 100% of why I purchased the tablet (I wanted it for reading technical documentation) and it hits that right on the money. Colors are sharp and vivid, text is smooth and clear as day, and blacks are black.Great for rooting. The first thing I did when this arrived was root the tablet, install ClockworkMod Recovery and the CyanogenMod 10.1 ROM. It is smooth and fast with CM and customizable to all my needs.On the downside, this is a 16x10 screen. This aspect ratio is great for movies, but I don't plan on using my tablet for that. 16x10 is awful for nearly everything else. It does not properly fit most PDF books or academic research papers. It does not feel good in your hand, and is moderately uncomfortable regardless of whether it is held horizontally or vertically. It feels like I am holding a miniature widescreen television, not a pad of paper or a paperback book.Pressure sensitivity on the display is bad. Do not expect to be able to paint with this tablet like the recently announced Toshiba Excite Write. General sensitivity is OK. Multitouch is OK. There are bug reports floating around that 10 fingers on the tablet will result in at least one of the touches not registering. This does not necessarily affect me, but it does affect some people.Response time and refresh is not awesome, which is expected from a tablet. The Nexus 10 is no worse than others. I am not sure what kind of gaming this would be relevant for nowadays, but do not expect to be able to hook up a mouse and keyboard and play Quake on this thing. It will look blurry every time you turn. For 99% of people who might want to play games on their tablet, this criticism will not matter.There is no SD card slot. This fallback is as close to a dealbracker as there could be for this tablet. Regardless of Google's desire for everyone to put their data on the cloud, this means the Nexus 10 can never function as a standalone media tablet, even with 32 GiB of space. It needs WiFi connection for true multimedia usage, and not having wireless and expecting to use this tablet for multimedia makes the Nexus 10 the equivalent of a $500 brick. In my case, I preloaded it with PDFs and epubs, so in areas without WiFi I can still read books.Things like CPU speed are difficult to review. The specs on this thing were top of the line when the tablet was released, but by now they are already dated.

Chrome browser would suddenly become unresponsive and eventually would lead to a crash and restart of the entire tablet to resolve this problem. HOWEVER, in the last few days, I have received the updated version of Android 4.2.2. Since receiving the update, I have not had a single instance of crashing or unresponsiveness on the tablet! This is the beauty of having updates straight from Google (the reason behind a \"Nexus\" branded device)! With a Nexus device, you will always have the latest software updates directly from Google within 3 days of it being released! You can't possibly beat that experience. The problem that most people have on other Android tablets and phones is that manufacturers like Samsung, Asus, Archos, LG, HTC, etc. all add their own features on TOP of the pure android code. This means that when a newer version of Android is finally released by Google, these manufacturers must take the code all over again and re-optimize their software to run on top of it every time! As I'm sure you can imagine, this is an arduous process that takes a while for the manufacturer especially when that manufacturer has to do the exact same thing to every one of its devices on the market. This leads to tablets and phones that remain on old software because either the company is still working on re-optimizing their overlay OR they simply decided to stop updating the devices because it's too much work to keep up with each and every one of their products. In the sense of Nexus devices, this is never the case!! Nexus devices run on PURE Android software with NO overlays. This software comes directly from Google and whoever built the tablet is NOT allowed to add any of their own proprietary software on top of the device. Google will have full control of what happens with that tablet. This means that you will ALWAYS have the latest and greatest features from Google IMMEDIATELY (1-3 days) after it is released!! Please use this information to help you decide on your next Android experience. This goes for the Nexus 10, Nexus 7, Nexus 4, and Samsung Galaxy Nexus (GSM version).

So I read many many reviews on Amazon and it seemed that the Nexus 10 was the most reliable and the one that would allow me to do everything I want it to do..  I have not yet plugged it into my desktop to download my Itunes, however, it can be done. I really like watching movies on this screen.  Its fun to use. It comes with eBook instructions on how to use the tablet.  I'm looking forward to playing with my new toy. The only reason I am not giving five stars is because the instructions are too basic. I hate to have to look around on android forum sites to learn simple things, like using the clipboard.  So, hear that, Google? Please make available more extensive directions for this great tablet for us folks who hate to waste time on the internet to find instructions.

I researched around and it came down to either this tablet or the Samsung Galaxy Note. Seeing that this had almost the same specs as the note but with less bloatware, I decided to buy it. I quickly found it doesn't really compare to having a real computer.The battery life at first was abysmal lasting around just a few hours, but after tweaking the settings it will last for days. It was a singular event but during the first week using it, the battery went from 45% to 0% in around 5 seconds. I contacted google and they were very helpful. Every now and then though, I do get random restarts, or an app with completely freeze and will require a complete shut down and restart.Charging is very slow. I would plug it in at 50% battery and leave it plugged in overnight to find that it was only at about 88% in the morning. I purchased a POGO cable and it made a dramatic difference in the charging rate.I didn't find out till after I purchased it that the new android software doesn't support flash player. It's not a huge problem but it is a pretty big annoyance that I can't watch simple videos (like Vines, Amazon instant video, or pretty much anything that isn't on youtube). There are ways to get around it but it seems to be more trouble than it's worth. Had I known, I probably wouldn't have purchased the tablet. At this point, my Nook HD has more functionality than the Nexus 10.The tablet is pretty fast and works really well. A big problem is that i can't change document properties. I'm an electrical engineering student and I bought the tablet so that i can take and view class notes. The problem comes from my professors, since they are kinda old they accidentally label their notes \"chapter 1.notes pdf\" and the tablet won't recognize the format. It's a simple fix but I have to wait till I get home late at night and use my desktop to make the simple change to the label.All being said, it IS a good tablet. It just doesn't seem to be do what I had been hoping it would.", "Date": "March 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "One size doesn't fit all", "Author": "Otto Andersson", "ReviewID": "R24XSB0PQEMRYS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Why I got this:Before getting this, I had gotten and returned a Chromebook and Windows 8 hybrid laptop. The Chromebook was close to being something that I would keep, but Windows 8 convinced me that Microsoft is egotistical and out of touch. So, I decided to stick with Android. My goal was to have something that I could take to the coffee shop with me or just use around the house. I wanted something that was good enough to almost serve as a laptop without getting into any heavy tasks (gaming, video editing etc).What I like:The screen is beautiful. Of course this is the major reason most people get the Nexus 10. Even almost 2 years since it's release, the screen sharpness measured in pixels per inch is higher than many new tablets coming out. I love the the ability for multiple user accounts! I can lend my tablet to someone without them having to see my private files or  risk having them install stuff I personally do not want. This is especially a handy work around to running the tablet for 2 modes (work and personal). I like the big bezels, because it actually is practical on a 10 inch tablet. I can hold this with both hands having a place to rest my thumbs. The material on the back really nice. There mostly isn't any unnecessary bloatware considering that most users will want to install many Google applications. Nexus also gets the latest updates, which I appreciate a lot. Even when Google stops supporting this, I will be able to easily root and continue upgrading this.What I don't like:The android OS really isn't 1 size fits all. I have the same OS (Kit Kat) on my Nexus 7 (2013) and my Galaxy S4. It works beautifully on these devices, but isn't well suited for a 10 inch tablet. Google could have easily worked around this issue by giving users the ability to change the location of the software keys (multitasking, home, back). Instead, I have to constantly change the position of my hands to awkwardly reach for the multi tasking button.I don't care what reviewers say, this thing is laggy. There will be many times I get lag when just switching programs or between screens. My Touchwiz Galaxy Note 2 running earlier versions of android is much smoother than the Nexus 10. It simply doesn't go as fast as I think it should have.Would I buy it again:No, unless I got it for 70 to a hundred bucks cheaper. For the 10 inch and higher tablet space, I think the ASUS Transformer has the best Idea. I ultimately chose this unit for its price and the hope that I could emulate the transformer by later buying add ons (keyboard, mouse, etc). I have hooked up a mouse and keyboard to the nexus 10, and it really isn't that intuitive to navigate.There will probably be a better and updated version in the future. I think the Nexus 10 should have eliminated the flash back facing camera and vibration to focus on performance issues.

But I was disappointed to find a slew of major issues running the latest Android OS (v4.4.3 as of writing). Look a little deeper than the fanboy reviews and you will find a number of widespread issues with this tablet, many with no apparent fixes. This indicates fault in the tablet hardware, drivers, and/or Android OS implementation. The main issues are:*Poor web and PDF rendering performance (I tried every browser and reader available, some performance tweaks available in Cyanogenmod help but still less fluid than older/lowerend devices like the iPhone 4 and iPad 2)*Switching application focus causes original app to reload when switching back, losing your place in file and web browsers (i.e. overzealous memory management even when free RAM is available)*Short battery life, ~4 hours of use, but at least that much to fully recharge (better be near an outlet if you forget to charge overnight)*Numerous stock apps like Google Maps drain battery by running in background (fixed with Greenify app)*Touchscreen exhibits poor responsiveness making it more difficult to select text and even type with the on screen keyboard compared to the older iPhone 4 and iPad 2*Both built-in cameras are awful, giving out of focus, grainy pictures (somewhat fixed by the CameraFX app but focusing, flash, and resolution still sub-par compared to my older free no-brand cell phone)*Auto-brightness is essentially non-functional, always requiring manual adjustment. How can Google ignore such a simple yet important feature when Apple nailed it such a long time ago?*Daily random rebootsThe last was mostly fixed by the 3rd party ROM CyanogenMod, which is updated daily. Unfortunately, random reboots still occasionally happen and CyanogenMod introduced a few new issues like the constant error \"theme provider has stopped working\" popping up 10-15x/day and the lock screen always stuck in landscape even if you are in portrait orientation, forcing you to awkwardly unlock sideways.You would think years after its release Google would have most of the issues fixed and a polished product. Yet their priorities appear to be elsewhere as they only release Android OTA updates a few times a year. Overall, I'm very disappointed with the $300+ I dropped on this tablet to get a product that works like its still in beta testing. My confidence in Google to put out a quality consumer product is now non-existent.Too bad Apple has control issues and locks down iOS like they own your life. I would switch but would miss all the customization possible with rooting. If considering a tablet I would recommend holding out until Apple chills out a bit with limiting customization (if this is important to you), or until the Android OS matures a bit, or even checkout other tablet manufacturers on the Android platform that may have better custom implementations.", "Date": "June 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "this headline thing is not fun!!!", "Author": "lynny", "ReviewID": "R1MJNK1TYMA95I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i use amazon to shop alot, and i love my tablet. i don't like the rules for how long a review should be though!", "Date": "January 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Died in two days!", "Author": "abhi", "ReviewID": "R1RR4SPNZ3N5OF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Defective unit, didnt expect a Samsung built tablet to have such issues.The design is two generations old.

Seriously this device has a terrible charge rate and a proprietary cable should have been considered... 8 to ten hours to charge this, and it will use the percentage almost like a laptop would. This is the only tablet I know that will eat the battery right out of the box. Do not bank on using it on charge and never having to worry about drainage. But the experience is so smooth. You'll feel like you're playing a ps2 game, back when the hardware pushed the software and not the other way around.Also, the speakers leave much to be desired vs the kindle. Your hands also cup around the kindle speakers so you'll be sure to hear it better depending on how you handle the device.It's safe to say the nexus is a powerhouse, I fully loaded my tablet like I have done to my last and it still plows through games and apparently with no flinching aside from some hard loading on ironman the official game. But! The tablet doesn't warn you when it doesn't like the environment. So sometimes you'll face a force close out of nowhere and feel like the device may not be compatible... Just kill some tasks with the multitask button and it will return to it's old self, running through content. But it seems clear that this really isn't a normal tablet. and it might have been made to at least stare windows 8 convertibles in the face. Because the processing power at the sake of life is apparent. It feels impractical and I'm sure everyone feels it when they have to stop the experience to charge it. Or have the tablet close a game and you would angrily wonder why until you see you only have 2 percent. Right out of the box it died at 10%, but after that it hasn't happenedNetflix is great, and the YouTube application gives the same impression.It's the price of power I guess, the tablet will fly through it's own clothes (battery) if you don't stop it. The stability may get better after it actually charges, but if you knew how powerful this thing is you'd struggle to stop.I'll probably update again later, but until then my old review is below.Unlike kindle, the support base is a lot bigger, you can finally take on apps like grand theft auto 3 and vice city, and nvidia actually has a few games that work well here.Well after my tragic defeat in trying to make kindle into a Google tablet... I bought this guy! I've only had it for a few hours but I can tell you now that it's surely a clean experience. The apps load very well, the only application that gives me trouble is go keyboard, and it's only in the settings.I'm comparing these two devices because they're rivals in my opinion.Kindle fire hd 8.9 and the nexus are both full hd tablets, are supposedly the only tablets that have mimo Wi-Fi, lack tegra 3 for no good reason at all, have no sd card slot, and are amazing in their own right... but personally, you're getting what you pay for with these two... they're both incredible, but the nexus 10 literally shadows and engulfs it if compared by specs alone, while at a first real gaming use the kindle will prove to be more geared to someone who is using the tablet vs looking at it multitask seamlessly.One HUGE disadvantage to this tablet is the engine, it is not tegra. At this point it should be depressing that a device has to support tegra to have a stable feed of high end apparently that make your tablet stand out. Another is that I don't see any software correlation to Samsung apps, such as killer candies like the artistic element. It seems apparent that we're going to have to wait a little longer for this tablet to shine, which better happen some time in it's life. Especially at the price point.Hardware build is second to the kindle hd in my opinion. If you're charging and broadcasting video you'll be met with cables sprouting at opposite ends of the device, if you trigger a loud ad you're probably going to have to find a spot to prop the tablet so you can adjust. Volume isn't a shortcut on the first or second notification. And Amazon wows with their out of the way navigation and favorites button.Software wise this tablet wins hands down, with tons of multitasking and smooth function, you'll only wish Amazon had a hand on the build and that Samsung used more common hardware. You'll be very pleased with how this tablet handles itself, but one test I haven't tried is streaming an hd flash video in full screen... that would normally make the kindle seize up and force close the dolphin browser... no wonder they had no browser alternatives.I haven't tried the camera, because I believe the Amazon camera was pretty dull. And I really don't have anything I would like to capture at this specific moment. Microphones were most likely properly placed moreso on the kindle.Google and Amazon have apparently done brilliant jobs at ensuring that you don't have an excess of bloatware, they offer the minimum to get your mainstream media ready to run and enjoy. Google sort of throws new material at you like hangouts and now, while Amazon sticks to the forte and offers Skype.The internet speed is similar, and I find that both could probably be pushing similar speeds but the amounts of downloads stopped through crashes and failure to multitask will most certainly make the nexus look like the clear Victor, especially if kindle stops Wi-Fi when it's asleep too long.I will not comment on the Google store being an advantage because there's a way around it, but Amazon apps that I bought for my kindle hasn't transferred properly, so I'm guessing they're lost... which is sort of a slap in the face to anyone who won't stick to a kindle line... (don't quote me, but none of my saled gameloft dollar games want to work.) A big disadvantage for Google is being notified that Google will monitor installed applications... so emulator guys and people who want to test compatibility may be hit for piracy if the paid apparently has a rubbish licence check that let's you through. I've also gotten some trouble with re licensing on it, and I am left unable to validate my in app purchases.The nexus 10 has on the go cable support, BUT the most practical device someone would want to otg would be a phone in my opinion... and it doesn't read mine very well unfortunately. If you want surefire otg use, I suggest you buy a card reader to USB, but I do not have one or have tried one. So look around to confirm my suspicion. It does in fact work very well with the ps3 controller.I haven't tested either of this devices in HDMI usage. But I do own a cable for the fire hd and hope to God it works for the nexus 10. ON A SIDE NOTE. every game with control maps with strict pixel scales will make games troublesome on this tablet, no exceptions. Playing sealing sword and shadow on this is terrible, because the analog is the size of the capital letter O on the keyboard. Other games such as mame will have smaller buttons for the same reason, but it won't ruin gameplay.This device will get hot! Playing games like iron man will pressure the system, and it does skip sometimes, but if a slight skip is all a polished game like that will give considering it's.almost the temperature as a hotcake, as heat throttling, I'm sure this tablet will be ready for a lot of things Google will come up with.Overall, if you want an hd device that is dedicated to content and offers an experience that will make you happy then sad within the same update... (International kindle sale, deliberate disabling of wallpaper) at a price that will make you shrug your shoulders and hit buy, you can definitely get and fully enjoy a kindle fire hd 8.9. But if you want a device with obvious potential backed by Google's brand, that seems more than capable of handling itself under pressure, and is one of only three tablets I know that decided to make a full hd experience in your hands. I'd pick this one for the long haul and options. Though at the price point, I would also consider the iPad if I wasn't so invested in Google apps.Either way, if you really wanted a tablet, both of these are great choices... firmware and the client destroys the kindle and Google is what it always was. I'm sure Google isn't going to heave an update that makes you want to stop using the tablet like the kindle did to users who hate the home screen. But if you can ignore it the price is a dream.

I also own a iPad4 because my son took control of it so much, I decided to go ahead and get something different for myself which for Android the best one out there is Nexus 10 according to the so called expert reviewers out there. Problem #1) The touch is just not as responsive as the iPad4, I need it to touch 2 to 3 times on something to get there. Whereas, the iPad4 is almost always instant to the touch of the finger. Problem #2) Using the stock Google Chrome browser, when I scroll down the page, the words and pictures became blur, took about one to two seconds for the words and pictures to clear up. This is just not acceptable for a tablet at this price range. Problem #3) They system upgrade to Android Jelly Bean 4.3 means you would have your wi-fi dropping off constantly which is insanely frustrating. All these are true to my experience, I am not just writing something to knock this product. I also own the Nexus 7 which in my opinion is a better product than the Nexus 10. Since I own both the Nexus 10 and iPad4, I can honestly say the iPad4 is a superior product, it just less headache and I feel the screen resolution is notch better than the Nexus 10 too even though the spec say otherwise.

I do not recommend it to anyone.  I am about to go back to iPad, or maybe to a Windows tablet.I have had three main problems with the device.  These issues get temporarily resolved -- usually by the onerous chore of factory resets (I've done 3 of them) -- then they come back.  These issues pretty much render the tablet useless to me for the things I need a tablet to do.1) Exchange does not run properly.  On numerous occasions, it simply stops receiving (or enabling me to send) emails on my company's email system.  Sometimes I can get this to fix itself by re-booting or by turning wireless off and on, or by removing Exchange and adding it back.  But, this problems happens with too much regularity for the device to be useful and, as of right now, Exchange is not running at all.2) The internet is often slow as molasses -- like the speed of the old dial-ups, even though we have FiOS.  My wife's iPad works just fine, as does my iPhone (even when I have the cellular turned off to do a comparison on WiFi only).3) Probably because of 2), streaming movies, TV or other video is often a problem -- choppy playback that often simply stops for several seconds before resuming.  This even happens on YouTube, a Google service.I have other, specific gripes about the device / operating system -- e.g., it won't run Amazon Instant Video, it can't create playlists with more than 1,000 items, Google Pics takes it upon itself to reorganize my photo albums, etc. -- but the three items above are by far my principal complaints.There are some things I do like about the device compared to the iPad -- Swype keyboard, very nice display, greater ability to customize, a version of Open Office (though I understand the new iPads have a productivity suite as well).

There is no Itunes app for the Android, therefore you can't use Airplay, a very popular way of streaming your media to you TV or stereo.  If you want to download your Itunes library from your PC or Mac, good luck, I couldn't figure it out, there is no easy way, and a google search will confirm this.  I found the touchscreen to be very inconsistent on the Nexus 10, sometimes it was fine, other times, depending on the application, and size of the icon, very hard to press and activate, there was an inconsistency I haven't experienced on the Ipad 4. The camera and movie functions were simpler and of better quality on the Ipad 4. One thing I did like on the Nexus 10  is a backward arrow always visible on the bottom of the screen to retrace your steps which was often used and very handy.  Perhaps in 2 or 3 years if Google stays committed to the tablet they will catch up to Apple, but right now, it's not even close.  Perhaps there are workarounds to some of my observations cited above, but to me not worth the time or trouble, especially when the Ipad 4 ran so well out of the box for just slightly more money.", "Date": "May 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "WTF", "Author": "Michelle Holmes", "ReviewID": "R3U613HYEH7OMR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This item got here OPENED.
