{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Chromo Inc 7\" Black Android 4.0 Tablet", "Author": "Gregory S. Luff", "ReviewID": "R1CO4BSXYGHZK7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Over the past few years I have refrained form joining the tablet revolution because I already have so many digital electronic devices in my possession.  IE: 2 Android smartphones, pda, 2 digital cameras, 3 laptop pcs, just to name a few offhand.However, when this tablet caught my eye, I decided to try one, especially taking into account the price and features.Since this tablet has a limited internal memory (4 GB) I also purchased a 16 GB micro SD Card to push the capacity to 20 GB.So far I have been completely satisfied with its' overall performance. Remember, this is my first tablet!I like the fact that it does not require a contract since I mainly use it at home or at work, where I can use the Wi Fi connection.  I have also found it can be tethered to my smartsphone to access the Internet.  Took me a while to figure that one out, but it is possible!  Just use Google to find out how.The only downside I can see is the life of the battery (2-3 hrs).  But I knew this beforehand, so I always have one or two chargers with me.  It can be charged either with the plug in charger included with the tablet or with the same micro USB charger for my phone.  So, for me, this does not pose a problem.Yes, it may be slower than other higher priced tablets, but it does perform exactly as described.In fact, a few days after purchasing one for myself, I ended up purchasing another for my partner who has experienced the same results a myself.Overall we both are completely satisfied with this product.  I have rated it with 4 stars out of 5 simply because I have not had it long enough to give it 5.  This does not in any way mean it does not deserve 5 stars, I just have to use it more!Give it a try, you will be surprised how easy it is to use.", "Date": "February 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for the Price", "Author": "Eric Christopher", "ReviewID": "R15O2SP3DLQBT7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Are these those most powerful tablets on the market ?noDo they have the best picture?nobut for this price these tablets are fantastic.  I bought these for both my kids for christmas? Like every parent I was worried about buying a $400 tablet to put into my childs care.  Both of my kids are fairly responsible for their age, but still. then I came across this tablet.  these tablet has been great for everything my kids have thrown at it. the youngest is mostly games, but my oldest does email, netflix, hulu, youtube and a bunch of games and this powers through them all.so sure you can find more powerful better looking tablets out there, but if you are looking for a cheap, well built, tablet this one does it thing,oh one last thing battery lift I know that is everyones first concern,  My son will crush this battery in about an hour to and hour and half. but that is straight play, no break, cut the rope marathons. then he plugs it in and about 2 hours later battery is fully charged and he is back at it.  so for me with the amount of work he puts it through the battery does pretty good.", "Date": "January 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic tablet", "Author": "GadgetGirl", "ReviewID": "R5GFULIIMUTK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "<!--\n\nfunction

You can tell that much time and effort went into choosing the correct hardware to match the Android Jellybean software and that its not just generic pieces off the shelf.

This item comes free of all the extra junk usually preloaded onto the device and therefore has a much smoother user experience.

You get what you pay for. My wife bought this tablet due to the price. I set it up for her which was easy enough. The screen is not very crisp or bright. I put it side by side with my mid range android phone, a Motorola Atrix HD and my Dell Venue 8 tablet. The phone and tablet were much brighter, crisper, and not at all washed out like the Noria tablet. The tablet is sluggish and occasionally freezes. That being said, all of the apps work from the beginning. It does what you'd expect a $72.00 tablet to do and then some. Yes it feels kind of cheap in the hand and has bad battery life. There are a couple of minor positives. It doesn't come with a lot of apps you don't want or need, it takes a micro SD card, and there's at least three different ways of charging it. Did anybody really expect an Asus Transformer tablet for $72.00? If you have issues with it working, then return it and get another one. If it's not up to your expectations then go spend $200.00 + on a tablet you'll enjoy. The Nexus 7  2013 is the top 7 inch tablet in the world. The Asus Transformer tablets just about rule the 10 inch tablet world. For 8 inch you have the Samsung Galaxy Note 8, or if you're slightly more daring and a power user like me, the Dell Venue 8 might strike your fancy, especially at a $200.00 price tag. It runs Android 4.2.2, has 2 GB of RAM, 16 or 32 GB of internal storage, an item atom processor (the kind used in notebooks, netbooks, and even some laptops). It's fast for a Duo core processor at 2 Ghz speed, smooth, and is pretty nice for a midrange tablet. You get a lot of bang for your buck, especially since it's stock Android (without bloat ware or a Dell UI overlay). My only gripe is that the website that sells the Noria retails it for $349.00, even Amazon tries to retail it for $199.00. The most this Noria 7 inch tablet, by Chromo should ever retail for is $99.00, anything higher would be a ripoff. So, in retrospect, $72.00 is a good price, not fantastic, but good. That's approximately a 28%  savings, for all you bargain hunters out there.", "Date": "January 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "cheaper alternative", "Author": "John Taulbee", "ReviewID": "R1S5P72P9L2B40", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Battery does not stay charged very long.

All I needed was a simple one for my daughter to play games and watch videos on. I knew I wasn't getting any top of the line tablet when I purchased it. So knowing the specs on it when i ordered it here's my review:Works for everything I've tried so far, Netflix, hulu, Google play movies, kids games. Picture isn't best but it's a low end resolution I expected with the price. With only 512 ram it takes a little longer to load apps and videos but for less than 60 bucks you get some trade off in speed. With the pre-installed apps you have less than a gig of main storage, there is another 1.4 on the pre-installed nand flash drive. I've pet a 16 gig card full of movies on it and it plays perfect with no lag, just like Netflix and hulu most of the time.The only down sides I didn't know before buying it after looking at the specs was 2 things. First is the battery life. Truly can not make it thru one full movie with out having to put it back on the charger for last part of movie. Lowering the brightness helps but with it being a cheap screen viewing quality goes down. The 2nd is the headset jack. If you put the plug in all the way it plays both through the headphones and the speakers on the tab. About half way in and it only plays on the headphones. Not worth the hassle of returning as headphones aren't used often in my case.For 60 bucks it's hard to say even with the few issues to say it wasn't worth the buy for a tablet for kids or basic needs.", "Date": "January 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "my review", "Author": "David S Griner", "ReviewID": "R2GPASWPP7259R", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "when I got it....it had a glue like substance on the screen....charged it once and the second time the pin on the charger was bent...would not go in to charge...I know I ordered a new one but I felt like I got a used one", "Date": "March 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Two problems after just 3 days and a few other comments...", "Author": "Turtle", "ReviewID": "R19D4VIJGH1603", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "After careful research, I ordered this tablet. The other reviews were mostly positive. On Christmas Day, my 14 year old opens it and the internal pin for charging is bent. We had to find a tiny screwdriver to bend it back in place so it could be charged. Three days later, the pin on the charger itself falls out, yes, it fell out! After the first problem, I looked closer at the entire product and the box and can't find the brand name \"Chromo\" anywhere. It is a very generic box that says \"MID\" and \"Android\" all over it. The instruction manual also has no reference to \"Chromo\" anywhere. I reached out to the seller to ask about this and their response was: \"Thank you for contacting us. Many companies like Chromo, AGPteK, Kocaso, Allwinner, etc, sell this same MID tablet under their Brand name. You have received the correct item. Please advise.\"Yes, it was inexpensive. Yes, you get what you pay for. I am returning it and will purchase something sturdier.On a shipping note, I ordered this on Dec. 14th. It is shipping from the supplier. I get a note from Amazon on the 17th saying it shipped and I get a tracking number for USPS. It is shipped \"priority mail\". I look online and although it shows up with the tracking number, nothing actually happens until the 21st of December when it goes from Brooklyn, NY to Bethpage, NY. I followed it all weekend when I could see it showed up at my local post office on the 24th. I had to hunt down the postal truck to get my package before we left for Christmas Eve festivities...10 days...really? Not sure if I should place the blame on the USPS or the seller, perhaps a little of both??Update on Jan. 3, 2013...I will say the seller is very responsive.

It had no effect on the product working, so I decided to just keep it verses going through the hassle of shipping back. I than noticed the battery cable not wanting to charge right. My old charger will fit the Chromo Inc too. Old charger is a $49 android tablet made in China. I noticed the charger on Chromo tablet was much cheaper made than the Chinese tablet. The Chinese tablet was a 2.2 tablet, so not nearly as fast, but the Chinese tablet was constructed better. The charging cord works but seems to not make a good connection. On the Chinese tablet, I could charge while viewing the screen, the Chromo tablet does not allow one to view as charging. So what I think is the charger might be the problem.

Emmons \"rjemmons\"", "ReviewID": "R1S678GDZ3Y85S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great tablet for the price. I highly recommend it as a first tablet for someone who wants to try one without spending a lot, or for a child, etc. I am an engineer and software developer who purchased it because testing new Apps, and fooling around with the Android OS can sometimes crash a tablet, and I'd rather trash a $72 Noria than my $250 Google Nexus 7.It is not really not fair to compare a $72 Noria with a $250 Nexus 7, but the Nexus is the only other tablet I've owned, so I can't seem to help making that comparison. The surprising result is that although the Noria may lose on a direct comparison basis, it doesn't lose by too much, and it definitely wins on bang for the buck.I've had the Noria for about 3 weeks, and I'm very impressed with everything except the display.  The Noria display (800x400) is no where near as vivid and high resolution as the Nexus 7 (1280x800). It is also hard to read at an angle. Nevertheless, it's quite good for $72.Some reviewers have complained about poor battery life for the Noria, but it seems okay to me although I have not done a precise test. Two things that will kill your battery fast are 1) a long sleep delay, and 2) a bright screen setting. When I unboxed my Noria, its factory settings were pretty bad in both these areas. The sleep delay was 30 minutes! The screen was unnecessarily bright. These could be the source of some of the battery life complaints. My Nexus 7 sleep delay was set at 2 minutes at the factory. My Android cell phone was set to 30 seconds. So 30 minutes for a tablet seems way out of line. It will burn some heavy milliamps sitting there doing nothing. I set the Noria sleep delay to 2 minutes. I lowered the screen brightness to about 40%, which seems fine to me. I left the Noria running overight, starting with an 83% charge, and in the morning it had an 82% charge so its sleep power consumption is very low. The Noria battery is rated at 2200 mAh, expected to last 3-4 hours. The Nexus 7 battery is rated at 3950 mAh, expected to last up to 9 hours. So, the Nexus 7 battery  probably lasts twice as long, but we are talking about $72 versus $250. YMMV.Some reviewers have complained about the speed of the Noria, but, again, I do not see a problem. I use a tablet mainly to read books, and check Facebook and Twitter. I rarely play games. For me, the extra $250 - $72 = $178 bought just a little extra speed. When you click an icon on the Noria, there seems to be just a little more delay than you see on the Nexus 7. I think some reviewers may be confused between the speed of a tablet, and the speed of their Internet connection. I saw a YouTube video where someone compared the time that 2 tablets took to install a new App from the Google Play website. This does not measure the speed of the tablets. It measures the time it takes to download the App over your Internet connection plus the time the tablet takes to install the App. In most cases, most of the time is taken by the transfer of the App file over your Internet connection. This can be very variable, and has little to do with the speed of you tablet.I installed and ran the well known \"AnTuTu Benchmark\" software for Android tablets and phones, available free on Google Play, on both tablets. The Noria scored 9252, described as \"Not too bad.\" The Nexus 7 scored , 13735, described as \"Good\". For comparison, the Samsung Galaxy Note3 scored about 35,000, the Samsung Galaxy 4 about 25,000, the Samsung Galaxy S3 about 17,000, the Samsung Galaxy S2 about 10,000.The Noria has both front (0.3mp) and back (2mp) facing cameras. The Nexus 7 only has one front facing camera (1.2mp). The Noria has an HDMI connector the Nexus 7 has none. The Noria has 8GB flash memory, my Nexus 7 has 32GB. But ... the Noria has a micro SD card slot which can expand the memory to 32GB, and you can get a 32GB micro SD card for $20 if you find you need it. SD card memory can be somewhat less convenient to use than the internal RAM. The Noria connected to my home WIFI with no problem, and re-connects perfectly each time I turn it on. I have no problem downloading Apps or surfing the net. The Noria connected to my Windows 7 computer via USB with no problem. I have no problem transferring files between the computer and the tablet.If you're looking for bang for the buck, it is hard to beat the Noria.", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect kid tablet but don't get this if you are planing on using the camera.", "Author": "L.
