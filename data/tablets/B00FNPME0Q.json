The graphics speed very good.It reminds me of my old Asus.  The construction is solid with a metal backing.  I personally like the little extra heft.I've put a 32GB card in it for extra storage, you'll need it.Battery life so far is good.It's running android 4.2.2 and I like that.No issues with compatibility on any apps I've run so far.Bluetooth 4.0.  Works flawlessly.Connected quickly to my wireless and see's all my network devices.Wireless speed is very good and so far so it the distance on it.Ran some of the speed tests and it comes out in the middle of the pack, not bad when it's half the cost!I had an issue with the first charger with it and their support was very responsive.  That's a plus! I had the same issue with my Asus.Folks, for the price, comparing the features it's hard to beat.  I like it!To sum it up, put a 32gb card in it, speed is very good, battery life is good, it's smooth, construction is very good, the display is great.  Hard to beat the price and performance.

I got a good deal directly from Latte on the biggest auction site in the world. Free Shipping in addition to a free leather case. For $129 the build quality is exceptional. The back and sides have a nice brushed metal look and feel, no cheap plastics. As others have mentioned the screen looks great, I bought two other cheap tablets this Christmas season; a Nobis Quad core and also an Insignia flex 8, both fail in comparison. I returned those and took a gamble on this. While the screen is very nice I do wish it had more sensitivity, Its not as sensitive as my S3, Nook HD+ or even my first generation Galaxy tab. Hopefully that can be remedied with a future update; if that ever occurs. The android install on this tablet has minimal bloatware which is the way I like it. The first App I installed was Antutu benchmarks, this tablet scored 20,000 which is really good for a tablet in this price range. Antutu system info also verified that all the specs are as advertised. This is for my son so I did not test any games but as others reviewers have stated it plays graphics intensive games without issue. I took a look at the cameras and they are mediocre at best, not an issue since this tablets primary use will be for gaming and watching video.  One of the main reasons I purchased this tablet was due to its dedicated charge port, it does not charge through USB. This may be good or bad depending on how you look at it. USB ports are everywhere which makes charging at various location alot easier. I like this tablet's dedicated charge port because it allows charging  while using the USB port, it means no battery drain while using an OTG USB device. All you need is a micro USB to USB adapter. I tested my wireless keyboard and mouse and it worked without issue. For gamers this means you can use an xbox 360 controller without worrying about battery drain. I have not used it long enough to rate battery life, I'll provide an update after my son has used this for a week. If it survives the week and gets good battery life then I'll add another star.", "Date": "December 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "BEWARE", "Author": "Margueritte A.

When I first receive it, I was really excited. The package come in perfect condition and everything is in there including manual, chargee, USB and the new latte ice tab2 itself.- the tablet run on quad core RK3188 which is faster than tegra 3 in terms of benchmarks. It has quad core GPU Mali 400 which I wish it was something else since its not that good and lots of games aren't optimized for it.- the tablet is very fast and screen display is clear/crispy than my old iPad mini 2012. The batteryLife is really good. I would say around 8-9 hrs we browsing with 1/4 brightness. 5-6 hrs of heavy gaming which is really good and it doesn't heat up fast like others tablets i had so far. The build quality is superb! Its really well nice design. Its really thin and really buff like how I say it......fell like a premium tablet like apple products lol. Even my older brother who had an iPad air say the tablet is really well built and design considering it only cost me $129.99 with fast free shipping.- Gaming## I try modern combat 3-4, dead trigger 1-2, Asphalt 7-8, real racing 3, Blitz brigade, shadowgun dead zone, unjustic god among us, GTA vice city, gangstar las Vegas, subway surfer, temple run 1-2, dispicable me minions etc......and I could say that all those games run fine on the tablet. As you know, Mali 400 are not that good with heavy 3d games so the graphic might be off and laggy. If the tablet were to have sgx540+, its would be a really good gaming tablet coupe with a fast RK3188.- the internet on this tablet is good. It haven't loss signal or anything. The web browser is fast, load pages quickly. The speaker is what make this tablet different from others. Its on the bottom front of the tablet instead on the back. I like it since when you watch movies or videos, you can hear better. The quality of the speaker is really good. If you have ever own an nook HD, its the same loudness.- overall, the tablet itself is amazing, well design, fast, amazing display and really good battery life! For $129.99, what more could you ask???##update##  12/26/13---  - after 2 weeks, the tablet shut down by itself and when I turn it back on, it just show a blue blank screen. I have contact lattezone for a stock Rom since I could restore it using rkbatch tool. it'd been 2 days since I message them about uploading their stock filmware for latte ice tab2 which they say they will message me once they upload but so far no message about the filmware. Will update once I get a reply....12/27/13--fix my tablet! super easy to flash the stock filmware plus lattezone also give me instruction on how to. their customers service are awesome, thanks a latte!#update 12/27/13#- hey guys, just heard that Rock chip will be getting android kik kat 4.4 and SDK 2.0 for all RK3066&3188 tablets! Hopefully latte will put out a filmware update on this baby. Here's what I found that will improve:- 30% increase in videos and gaming performance plus graphics!- more optimized OS meaning smoother performance!-Bluetooth 4.0 and etc...Overall, this tablet is a steal plus the premium feel to it so look no further and start buying directly from LatteZone....( get free case plus fast shipping, if your lucky enough like me)", "Date": "December 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "MUST READ", "Author": "Siscowolf", "ReviewID": "R2I68D4OUEPDPM", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "If I'm being totally honest, this is a waste if money.  You would be better off spending an extra 30 bucks to buy a refurbished nexus 7 or Asus tablet, and here is why:1. Latte is an unknown, unworthy, Chinese company that prides itself in customer service - until you buy the product, then they never talk to you again!  No lie - go to Facebook or try to google it... You can't find almost anything on the Internet and there Facebook is riddled with dissatisfaction!2.The hardware sucks.  Plain and simple, it is cheap.  At first I was impressed with how pretty it looks and it feels light and fantastic.  Start to watch movies and play with the buttons and you realize - the buttons feel like they are broken, the speaker is quiet and crappy, the headphone jack doesn't work, and the screen resolution is tolerable... The specs are fine, but the way it is built and the materials used leave you disappointed!3. IT IS A TEEZ!!!! This tablet is great for making you feel like you have a nice piece of technology, and then letting you know that you can't really do the things that you wanted to do... Like mix music, or use it as a drawing pad, neither of which are very practical with this product.  I eventually have up trying to fix the issues since there is no support and no forums, and no help anywhere.  Gave it to my 5 year old daughter - all it's useful for is the vast market of google play games... And even then the sound still sucks.To sum it up: this tablet is not for anyone who wants a tablet.  This is a high priced kids toy!  It looks and feels great, has a nice screen that could use some more pxls, and runs great android 4.2 jelly bean software.  But this is where the good ends and a line of harsh disappointments fallow.  Bad speaker, broken headphone jack, terrible customer service, no support or online forums, and worst of all I couldn't use it for what I needed a tablet for!  This is only good for little games, movies (with bad sound), and browsing the Internet...I bought myself a new Nexus 7 - cuz I'm worth it!

This tablet has great hardware for the price. I cannot think of a tablet that has better specs for the price.2. Fast charging. The charger is a 2 amps.3. Cool aluminum backing4. Easy to root.5. Android 4.2.2 Jelly beanThe Bad:tl;dr Device needs polish mainly in the software.1. Old version of Google play apps. I cannot sync my Google account that has GAuthenticator enabled. Regular account will sync perfectly fine. This also means that externally manage accounts (education, business, or etc) will not be able to sync. =[2. The software doesn't seem to be optimized for the tablet screen. The size of the font or menu bars seem to be out of proportion for the device. Avoid if you have bad eyes or don't want to squint.3. Charging using the micro usb does not work. I must use the included charger.4. LCD light bleeding. Although this is not too bad, back light bleeding is visible under very low light.5. Charger port is not fully aligned. The internal motherboard could be aligned better.6. SD Card slot is hard to use. The internal motherboard could be aligned better.7. Device doesn't understand the top from the bottom. The camera is on top and speaker is on the bottom. This can be verified if you rotate the device and read the text on the back of the device. But certain apps recognize the device as the camera is on the bottom and speaker on the top. The same app on my Galaxy Nexus recognizes the phone orientation correctly. Another software optimization problem.8. Manual screen brightness. At the price point, I don't expect there to be an ambient sensor, but it still would have been nice.The Ugly:tl;dr Don't buy the tablet.1. The manufacturer website seems dead. People have posted messages about not hearing from the manufacturer. Basically, if you hardware dies, you are out of luck.2. I have sent a message to the manufacturer and seller. Since I bought it from LatteZone as a 3rd party seller, I hope to hear back to them soon. If not, I am returning this tablet.3. Not many resources for this particular device.

The 16 GB internal memory is kind of a lie. Due to very poor programming, that 16 GB is actually partitioned, so the way they set it up, you have 2GB internal memory and 14GB SD memory. This defeats the purpose of having an external card slot for many things. You can't transfer apps to the external card for example. You can download game ROMs, movies, music or any other programs that you can manually access, but you can't set a default path without rooting the tablet. The beefy quad core processor is kind of a joke as well. Whoever programmed and optimized the firmware clearly has no idea what they're doing. I can't run a low powered app while a single update downloads without the system crashing. With that much power under the hood, especially with the 2GB RAM on top of it, there should be no reason I can't download three apps, some songs and a movie while playing my favorite game with no troubles. Instead, I can't do two things at once with a quad-core processor. That means this tablet can't even manage half of what it's supposed to be capable of. Very, very poor optimization. Having a powerful processor and lots of RAM is meaningless if you don't program your machine to use it properly. The main desktop interface is ungodly sluggish, the sytem takes around 5 minutes to boot up all the way, the tablet frequently crashes while performing basic tasks and you can tell everything is in dire need of a massive OS and firmware upgrade.With all that being said, for less than $200 this is a decent tablet if you have the patience to deal with it's many faults. It does run apps very well as long as there's not another active app taking up memory, the battery isn't great, but it does last for 4-8 hours depending what you're doing (longer when not in use),  the wifi isn't amazing, but it gets the job done and the unit is well built and durable. Honestly, if all you can afford is a $200 tablet, this isn't a bad purchase. There's probably better cheap tablets in this price range with weaker processors and less RAM that run better, but if Latte gets off their butts and does an update to optimize and better utilize the hardware, this will be an great machine for the $. As it stands right now, if you have the extra money to spend on a better tablet, I'd say it's worth it.

However, it turns off randomly and will not restart even if the reset button is pushed.  The only way to get it to turn back on is to plug it in to the charger even though the battery has plenty of charge left and may even be full when this occurs.  I called  Latte tech support and I am still waiting for them to call me back.  I am very disappointed and will be sending this back.

I've now bought 3 of the 7\" Latte Ice tablets and paid anywhere from $123 to $135.  Basically the white version looks like an Apple 7\" clone sort of though is inferior to the Apple Mini in hardware specs..  The IPS screen looks great, like a higher end cell phone.  It has all the standard stuff though does lack an HDMI slot.  I compared it to a 7\" Dragon Touch tablet and both brought up and played youtube video's at about the same time though with the IPS screen the video was much sharper and colors more accurate.  The front speaker provides decent sound though none of the tablets have that great of sound that I've heard.Note - I ordered a couple more of the 7\" version since my initial review and the last one I received came with two plastic screen covers and a nice case that doubled as a stand for displaying the tablet on a flat surface.  It must of been a Christmas special cause I didn't specifically order these items but was happy to receive them.  Or maybe they just were rewarding my repeat business :)1/23/14 - I'm unable to get any of 3 different bluetooth mice to connect and work reliably on two different tablets.  Revising to three stars until this is resolved.3/7/14 - Revising to ONE STAR as there is 0 product support.  I requested help with the Bluetooth issue twice through Lattezone and once through here regarding the Bluetooth problem and did not receive so much as an email except the automated email right after I generated a support ticket.  If you buy and have a problem there is no help, do not recommend purchasing from Lattezone.", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very satisfied", "Author": "Mike Park", "ReviewID": "R1K9VOIVFONHNM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Look.  I read some of the bad reviews but decided to still try due to the low price.  I can honestly say this tablet has exceeded my expectations.  I own quite a few china tablets (ramos w30, hyundai T7, etc).  Performance is very snappy and the screen is quite lovely.  The battery life is very impressive (over 8 hours of HD movies) on a single charge.  Some people (reviewers) just ask for too much.  A great tablet for a little over 100 bucks.  I am impressed.

I've had mine since 01/2014. Comparing \"apples to I-muz,\" this android rocks. Great antutu score, and beautiful display. Some orientation bugs, but this can be somewhat corrected in settings>>accessibility and remove the check mark next to auto-rotate screen. Not a perfect fix, but it helps. You can change it back at any time you wish. I have rooted mine and I love the freedom to change and tweak settings. Something that is hard to accomplish on a \"branded\" tablet. It appears that www.lattezone.com has all but abandoned its customers, which is really disappointing. Some information can be gleaned from www.i-muz.com and www.rock-chips.com. With a minimal amount of effort, you can turn this tablet into a customized fun machine. The physical build seems well thought out. I like the covered ports, although the ports themselves, are a bit flimsy. If you handle them with a modest amount of care, they should last throughout the tablet's useful life. The case and buttons seems sturdy enough. The cameras are not the best in the world, but they suffice. One thing I would like to see more of are accessories for the Q9. For the money, I believe this is a great starter tablet, as well as a good daily user.
