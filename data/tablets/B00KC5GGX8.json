{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great low cost android option for my guests n friend", "Author": "Jason", "ReviewID": "R17CR22FGJT8YH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really needed a small basic android tablet that I can leave around the house for when I have guests or friends over. I got tired of having them use my own personal tablet which contains alot of important business apps and docs. This tablet is great for me because I can install all the same apps that work my home theatre and home automation stuff from the google store just like my main android tablet. It feel good to hold, the screen quality is nice and it doesn't have any problems running the apps I need. Some of the features like the cameras or memory card I dont have a use for so not sure how well they work. For the price I paid, I would recommend this as a basic tablet since it does its job well.", "Date": "May 23, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00KC5GGX8"}}
