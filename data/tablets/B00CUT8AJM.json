[...]For those who are looking at getting the best tablet out there at the moment, this is the one you should be looking at.My profile: Heavy tablet users for personal and business purposes.  I work on my tablet around 4-5 hours a day (Email / Documents / Spreadsheet / PDF ) and use it 1-2 hours for personal use such as watching movies or reading books/magazine.  Tablet is my go-to device for all internet related search I do.I have the following and/or used the following before:1) iPad 12) iPad 23) iPad 44) iPad Mini5) Kindle Fire6) Kindle Fire HD7) Kindle Fire HD 8.98) Asus Transformer with Keyboard9) Nexus 7 First Gen10) iPad Air 16gb WifiAs you can see, I been through many devices and hope this review with my experience helps users decide if this is the right device for them. This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this next year.  For comparison sake, I will use last year's Kindle and iPad mini as they are the closest size to this HDX 7\"Speed (9/10):This is leaps and bounds faster than last year Kindle HD.  Last year Kindle struggles to go through any HD video content I put in.  This year's HDX able to play seamlessly all the HD 1080p contents I added.  It is incredible how much the 2.2Ghz quad processor improved vs last year's model Dual 1.2Ghz.Screen (9/10):This is the biggest improvement over last year's model.  The screen is in true HD 1080p (1920x1080).  This means any HD content I throw at it will view in its intended resolution.  The screen is crystal clear (much better than iPad mini) and the viewing angle is incredible.  I have this Kindle hanged in the middle of the car and at any seat it is view very clearly.  Last year's model was not as clear as this.  This is excellent for my minivan with my kids watching all the HD movies.  The brightness of the screen is also much brighter than last year's modelSound(8/10):The sound system in this Kindle Fire HDX is using Dolby Digital Plus with virtual 5.1 surround sound.  That gives this device a much better surround sound then previous generation's.Build (8/10):This HDX is more \"angular\" than last year's device.  It's slightly rougher to hold in the corners than last year's model due to sharper edges though I doubt any users will hold their tablet by their corners.  The device is noticeable lighter (395g for Kindle Fire HD vs 303g for Kindle Fire HDX).  This mean you can hold this for longer time without fatigue.The power and volume button placement on this Kindle Fire HDX is interesting.  It is behind the device which allows it to hide away from front view.  However, this can cause user to accidentally hit the on/off button or the volume button when not being careful.  Aesthetically it is great but it is definitely not a practical solution when you are trying to use this on the go.It does look sturdy enough to survive minor drop but I highly recommend getting a case for it.  Those sharp corners seems more prone to dents than round corners for last year's model.Battery (6/10):This is probably the biggest drawback for this device.  The battery life is not as good as last year's model.  This is quite logical as last year's HD has a 4400mAh battery while running 720p while this HDX runs Full HD 1080p but runs only on a 4500mAh battery (only 100mAh more than last year).  The 1080p screen pulls a lot of power vs last year's model when the screen is on, especially when running HD videos.  I'm able to achieve 5 hours of heavy use compare to 7 hours for last year's Kindle Fire HD at medium brightness with Wi-fi on all the time.  I tend to bring around an external battery pack but prefer something that is integrated (like a battery case)Software & software compatibility (8/10):The amount of app is still lacking compare to App store or Play store but has been steadily increasing which is a great sign. Games and software boot time has increased noticeably and compatibility is not an issueSilk browser has definitely improved compare to last year's tablet with multiple tabs actually now usable on the HDX.  For last year's version, it is practically unusable after 2 tabs due to the lack of hardware resource on the tablet (especially when the website is not optimized for mobile use).  The HDX has no problem going through any webpages I throw at it.Hopefully more apps will be optimized to use quad core soon.  I'm guessing some of these apps are only optimized for last year's dual core.I haven't got the opportunity to use Mayday yet but will review about it once I get more update on this.Complimentary Accessories (3/10):For all smart devices, one of the most important time is the number of accessories available.  At launch, it is understandable the lack of accessories but productivity focus accessories such as integrated case/keyboard are missing at launch.  This is rather disappointing as it can be a powerful productivity device with the right accessories attached.  Also the lack of case selection is quite astonishing for a flagship product on Amazon.  Hope there will be more cases such as battery case (due to above battery problem) or rugged case come out soon.Price (9/10):I got the special offer model at 16Gb (lowest end model) and it is enough for me to use.  The special offer ads are not intrusive like last year's model and sometimes does reveal some items I want. Compare to the ipad mini, this is practically a steal.  For those with the Nexus 7, it is quite comparable in price.Conclusion in one sentence: Amazon's iPad mini killer (8.5/10)For people who are justifying if this is a good upgrade, I say YES to that.  The speed and screen difference alone is worth the upgrade.  The whole user experience just improve drastically with the HDX.It use to be, for Kindle Fire HD, you will trade low price for slow performance, stutter and lag.  It honestly makes you think twice if the price is really worth all that poor experience.For HDX, this is no longer the case.  You get both great price, great screen and great performance that surpasses iPad mini. To me, the HDX is seriously Amazon's iPad killer.  It really marks how well Amazon has done to make themselves a worthy competitor in the tablet market. I hope some software upgrade or battery pack can make this the ultimate road warrior!****************************Dec 23th 2013 - 2 months  update *********************************So I have been using between this HDX 7\" and the 8.9\" HDX.  I also been using an iPad Air 16Gb Wifi and here are some updates, particular on the negative points mentioned previously.App Store - not so refined still.  Downloading and Installing problem occursThe app store after 2 month is still a bit lacking.  There are some freebie deals during cyber monday which I jumped (who doesn't like free stuff?)but still nothing that either the Apple App store or Google Play don't have.  Amazon App store really needs some exclusive apps to become a \"must get\" device.Now comes the bad part - I tried to download Magic 2014 game (big fan of Magic the Gathering since teen) from the Amazon App Store and the HDX 7\" downloads this rather slowly.  In fact, I noticed that when it reaches 50% it drops back down to 30% and redownloads the package again!  Since I'm not in a rush I really have no issue with this re-download problem.  However, this can be problem to some people who have limited bandwidth per month and won't appreciate redownloading the same thing again 2 times (or more but I didn't catch that).Once it reaches 100%, the app store attempts to install the software.  It goes into \"Installing...\" state for a while (at least couple hours).  Knowing that there's something weird going on, I rebooted the HDX 7\".  Once I rebooted it, the software shows it was never downloaded!Perhaps there's some application specific problem with this game but this really shows a rather poor experience on the Amazon Kindle Fire HDX.  I would expect a brand new top of the line Kindle Fire HDX would have ironed out simple bugs such as this but clearly, the Amazon App Store have 2 things it needs to work on:1) If this is an application specific error, Amazon needs to proactively test this release on all their devices before allowing it on the Amazon App Store.  It's quite obvious if any Amazon App store guys have even tried to install this Magic 2014 game that it just won't install.  Literally half the reviews on the review complain about this2) For these buggy release, Amazon should proactively pull this application from the store - the experience that lead to all the hours of download and wasted bandwidth got the user nothing in the end.  I can imagine some users with capped bandwidth or using their cell data to download will be furious if they know an app less than 1Gb rack them couple Gb of download.App Store is a big part of Amazon's Kindle Fire ecosystem and poor experience such as this really deters client in continued use, especially when all Kindle Fire are locked down to Amazon software ecosystem.  When you cannot even use the Amazon software ecosystem, any excellent hardware that this machine has becomes inaccessible and worse of all, a waste of user time to figure out.Now most people may say this criticism is related to the game(in this case, Magic 2014).  I believe this is not the case.  The responsibility of Downloading and Installing of the Magic 2014 application belongs to the Amazon App Store (after all, it is Amazon App Store people who authorized this to be released in their store). I start to find all other game download and installation questionable and my own usage time in App store browsing and purchasing drops drastically.From the above download experience, I did attempt to find some help from Amazon.  Here is where the more problem arises.Mayday - speaking to rep reading off outdated troubleshooting guidesAfter noticing my Magic 2014 download is gone, I attempted to contact Amazon through the Mayday button.  It's really my first time using this function so I don't really have any prior experience in using it.My Mayday call was picked up by Hayley (if I recall).  You can see a big Amazon logo in the background beside the customer service rep and she looks pretty friendly.  I explained my situation with the App store problem to Hayley but it seems she wasn't able to help; therefore I got transfer to a \"Tech Advisor\".  This Tech Advisor can't be shown in the video camera and asks for my credentials.  She also made me explain the problem again which I explained to Hayley (I would have thought someone will note down my problem as I need to use couple mins to explain again).  She then pulls something that you expect from an Indian Call Center by asking me to disconnect my internet modem.  I find this rather funny as I mentioned this is a software specific problem with the installation and has nothing to do with my modem or Internet connection.  I also mentioned that I am running a server at home and pulling the modem disconnects it from the Internet which breaks other services I am running unintentionally.  She seems to be stuck so she forward me to another representative (which if I heard correctly, it is the app store support rep).Once I got connected to the 3rd rep, they ask me to check my tablet date and time (which is correct).  This rep later ask me to press on options that are not the screen.  I suspected this rep was reading off an old Fire OS troubleshooting guide as I recently updated the Fire OS system and that some options and buttons are changed.  Given the large amount of time spent and there's no resolution, I went to my iPad air and downloaded the game successfully in couple mins while still have Amazon on the Mayday call.  I informed the 3rd tech support of this and thank them for their time although there was no resolution in the end.I very much prefer having the game on my Kindle HDX as the 7\" is perfect to bring outside for quick game or two, but the amount of time spent on troubleshooting and resource wasted on this is honestly not worth my time.  I ended up having to play this game on the iPad Air larger screen but also paid for in app purchase because the game itself is very good.It's a good lesson to learn that the whole software user experience needs to be more streamline and fluid on the Kindle.  Amazon has done successfully in the physical good purchasing section of the kindle fire (in fact I spent thousands of dollars more on Amazon.com using the kindle fire than on PC and very satisfy with the results) and that if it can bring the same experience to the software app store just like the physical store, Amazon will have a winner here. I use my machine extensively for magazine reading / internet browsing but when it comes to app download, I currently have my doubts if it will be another bandwidth hog and a waste of time.Display - blue hue appears but not very apparentSome people ask if the blue hue appears on the edge.  I can notice this if I'm reading off a totally white page (like a ebook or magazine).  However it is not very noticeable and that your eyes will ignore it eventually.  After all, words or graphic don't appear on the edges of the screen.Battery life - Still needs work onAfter the OS update, there seems to be a slight improvement with the battery life.  However, still not enough for me to really go through the day without bringing an external battery charger pack along.  At the moment, I am still looking for a 2 in 1 case + battery solution but it is not available.  I hope this can be my daily driver but without the battery life, it may just be a brick by the afternoon.Purchasing on Amazon.com - becomes addictive (Could be good or bad for some people!)I realized my spending on Amazon went up considerable compare to last year thanks to this Kindle Fire HDX.  I will be browsing it online and have these items saved on screen, constantly reminding me to get it.  Amazon really done a good job at this and really met, if not, exceed their goal in getting users buying from kindle fire.  With last year fire, the browsing experience on Amazon.com was not nearly as fluid as this year's HDX.  This makes it hard to keep my attention and urge to buy.  For people who wants a good purchasing experience, this Kindle Fire HDX will surely provide that.  For ones who need to save money, you may want to get your finger off the buy button!My overall rating stays the same as Amazon keeps knocking off prices for these machines making it still the best bang for the buck.Apr 28 Update - Family Use----------------------------------------------Got my kids an extra Kindle Fire HDX 7\" for them to play with.  My HDX 7\" is still running well with all my Instant Video and newsstand subscription inside.Since my kids don't treat their new toys with much care, I went and got them and myself a zerolemon EVA Case on Amazon.  The case is useful for prevent dents and major falls on your Kindle.  Even with my Kindle, the top pantel where the speakers are started to peel off a bit (amazon used glue to assemble the speaker grille top panel).  Case works great for hiding some of the blemishes of the kindle fire hdx 7\"Overall still satisfied with my machine and frankly been the best bang for the buck tablet i ever have.As mentioned, I will update this review periodically.  Next time I will focus on physical wear and tear of the machine after couple more months and again on battery life (as all electronics have a diminishing battery duration throughout its course of use). [...] Thanks for reading!", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent 3rd-generation tablet that compares favorably to the competition", "Author": "NF", "ReviewID": "R2KVHBC7NMNOGU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the middle model of the three models that Amazon is shipping this year: the Kindle Fire HD, the Kindle Fire HDX (this tablet), and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\". This is the successor for last year's Kindle Fire HD but with an updated operating system and new features, a redesigned shell (with the power and volume control buttons more readily accessible), an absolutely amazing display, superb sound, an included power adapter, and the new Mayday feature. See http://www.amazon.com/review/RNH700DOM9WN3/ for my review of the Kindle Fire HD and http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YPITHVTYLCZT for my review of the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\".Update: Some users are reporting a bluish glow around the edges of the screen for the HDX. If you search on YouTube for HDX Blue Haze, you can find a video showing the issue. Amazon has updated their \"Learn More\" link with the following info:\"To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7\" at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20% improvement in power efficiency.\"\"As a result of using these blue LEDs, you may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. All displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy.\"If this is something that you think would bother you, I'd recommend taking a look at the YouTube video or taking a look at the HDX at a local Best Buy or office superstore. I've also uploaded a user image here of my HDX with a book loaded so that you can see the blue glow (http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B00DOPNO4M/).The Amazon tablets are primarily content consumption devices, best suited for connecting to the Amazon ecosystem, including videos, music, books, apps, and so on. With the free Prime trial subscription, you can check out the Prime Instant Video options and watch movies and shows at no charge for 30 days. For videos, music, and books, the Amazon selection is at or near the top of the list; for apps, much less so. 90% of the top 100 apps are available on Amazon.com, as well as 100,000 others, but that's only a small fraction of what is available with Google or Apple.It's not quite as bad as it sounds because, while the competition has ten times as many apps, most of those apps are, um ... how shall I put this ... less than stellar (look up Sturgeon's Law). If there are specific apps you need or want, you definitely should double-check before purchasing to make sure that they are available. The apps that will likely never become available on the Kindle Fire ecosystem are those apps that require Google services (i.e., anything that uses Google location services). One ameloriating factor is that it is possible to side-load most of the apps from the Google Play store onto an Amazon tablet and a web search on side-loading apps onto Kindle Fire will show dozens of websites with detailed instructions. If the app you are sideloading requires a Google service to work, though, it will not run on the Fire, even if you manage to successfully install it.Like the other Kindle Fire tablets, as well as the Apple iPad and the Google Nexus, the Kindle tablet line doesn't have a micro-SD slot, so the assumption is that you're consuming content from the cloud. This is fine when you're using your tablet with wifi; not so good when you're traveling and want to load up your tablet with content for the trip. If the latter is something you expect to do regularly, you might want to consider the 32GB or 64GB versions, or pay the additional price for the 4G version, which is available on the 7\" tablet for the first time. Also, if all of your content is on iTunes or on Google Play, you would have to side-load everything onto the tablet. As is true of Apple and Google tablets, there's no way to automatically connect to the cloud storage of the competition.Something new this year is the ability to download Prime Instant Videos. I verified that I can download Prime Instant Videos to my Kindle Fire HDX. However, that option is not available for all movies and TV shows. It looks like they had to get the permission of the studios and not all of them said yes. So, for example, I was able to download \"Casablanca\" but not able to download \"The Avengers\" even though both are part of the Prime Instant Video collection and both are available for free streaming.Update: Adding a bit from a reply in the comments: Amazon is clearly looking at the Enterprise market with this launch, at least based on the details they provide. They've added full accessibility support (required in order to get government contracts), will be bringing support for VPN and business printing, have a better email client with tighter integration to Exchange, and are including OfficeSuite for productivity. There are other productivity tools available in their app store, as well, although both Google and Apple, particularly the latter, have more options. When VPN support arrives, I'll definitely be taking a look, as it would be nice to not have to lug my laptop home every night.So how does this Kindle Fire HDX differ from the previous generation Kindle Fire HD?Display: 1920x1200 (323 ppi) vs 1280x800 (216 ppi). It's more than that, though, as the colors are richer, brighter, with better contrast. This display has been judged by many reviewers as the best in its class and I would have to agree. Amazon has also added technology to automatically adjust the contrast and brightness when viewing the tablet in bright sunlight. While there is definitely a noticeable improvement, this isn't what you need for reading on the beach. For that, you'll need an eInk reader like the Kindle Paperwhite.Sound: As far as I can tell, the sound is about the same. This was already one of the best-sounding tablets on the market, with Dolby stereo output and enough power to actually make it possible to listen to music or video without requiring headphones.Size and Weight: Noticeably lighter (10.7 oz vs. 13.9 oz) and noticeably smaller (7.3\" x 5.0\" x 0.35\" vs. 7.6\" x 5.4\" x 0.4\"). This is a comfortable tablet to hold one-handed, even for long periods of time.Processor: It's a *lot* faster (2.2GHz quad-core, top-of-the-line CPU, compared to 1.2GHz dual-core). This tablet is amazingly fast and smooth, with the fastest processor in its class. Every game I've tried on it has run smoothly, with no hesitations, slowdowns, or glitches. Scrolling through content is amazingly smooth and fast now, without the hesitations and occasional slowdowns of the previous generations.Build: A redesigned shell with power and volume control buttons that are easy to find! This is a solid build but the back of the shell is something of a fingerprint magnet. Since most of us will be buying a case to put the tablet in, that may not be an issue.Camera: If there is a difference between last year's camera and this year's, I'm not able to see it. It's a high-def camera suitable for video-conferencing or Skype. Like last year's model, there is no rear camera. If this is important to you, you'll need the 8.9\" version.HDMI Output: This is the one area where last year's model wins. Amazon has removed the HDMI out connector from its tablet line (but see the description above for details on how Amazon is providing a software solution for sharing your tablet screen on your television). No other tablet that I'm aware of has this functionality so if this is something you need, you should be able to purchase one of last year's models fairly cheaply.Battery Life: The same, at 11 hours. However, Amazon has added a special \"reading mode\" to the device, which they claim will extend the battery life to as much as 17 hours. I did not test this. For my own personal use, the battery life is adequate.Price: It's more expensive ($229 vs. $199) but this year they include a power adapter, which was a $20 extra last year, so the actual difference in price is $10. For what you're getting, that price increase is definitely justified.It has an updated OS and updated feature software (including the free unlimited Mayday customer support feature). The software updates include the ability to download some Prime Instant Videos to your device and watch them offline, enhanced accessibility, enhanced enterprise controls and features (so now it's better suited for office work), enhanced email client, enhanced parental controls, improved X-Ray features (now including lyrics for music, as well as additional information for both books and movies), integration with GoodReads (coming soon), and the like.Where I noticed the biggest difference was the home screen. The default view is still the carousel but if you swipe upward, you'll see a more traditional icon view. The \"Recommended for you\" display on the home screen is now smaller and much less obtrusive (and it can be turned off in the settings). Amazon has also added multi-tasking of a sort, where swiping up from the bottom of the screen while you're in an app shows you the 20 most-recently-used items from your home screen, so you can quickly switch from one app to another without returning to the home screen.There is also a left panel available on most screens (but not the home screen) and in some of the apps, with navigation links and settings to make it easier to navigate and control your tablet or to navigate within the app. If you tap the center of your display and then swipe left while you're reading a book, for example, you'll see a panel that shows you the table of contents, the About the Author link, the Sync to Furthest Page Read link, and so on.The Kindle FreeTime option and the parental controls are still among the best in the business. If you want a tablet for a child and want to control what they can access, how long they can use the tablet at any given time, and the like, Amazon has you covered.You can now also schedule \"Quiet Time\" on the tablet, where notification sounds and pop-up notifications are disabled, either on a temporary basis by simply pushing a button or on a scheduled basis. Frankly, I doubt I'll ever use this feature but if you're the type who likes to read or watch video until you fall asleep, it's kind of nice to be able to disable all sounds so that you don't get rudely awakened when, e.g., someone plays a new word in your Words with Friends game.Mayday: This is a huge gamble by Amazon and it will be interesting to see whether it pays off. This isn't a feature for a techie like me and I didn't use it (although I was sorely tempted). From the commercials, it's pretty amazing, particularly that you can get a live chat in a matter of a minute or less (Amazon's goal is something like 15 seconds, I believe, although I can't help wondering what will happen on Christmas Day!). If you're thinking of getting a tablet for a technophobe, the addition of this feature may make the Kindle Fire HDX your best choice.How does this tablet rank against the competition? There are really only two other tablets in its class currently: the Google Nexus 7 and the just-announced Apple iPad Mini with Retina Display.Display: All three devices have retina displays, with the 7\" HDX and the Nexus at 1920x1200 (323 ppi) and the 8\" iPad Mini at 2048x1536 (326 ppi). All three displays are stunning. Amazon claims that it has enhanced the ability to read the display in bright sunlight, something that's a problem for all such devices. While this wouldn't be my first choice to read by the pool (I'd pick the Paperwhite), I can testify that it is easier to view the display in bright sunlight than its predecessors.It's worth noting that the aspect ratio of the HDX and Nexus is 16:10 while the aspect ratio of the iPad Mini is 4:3. Where this matters is watching video. If you're watching an old television show, a 4:3 aspect ratio is fine. If you're watching a high-def movie, the 4:3 aspect ratio is going to leave large black bars on your screen and the video will be much more compressed than it would be on the HDX and Nexus. Apple chose to maintain backward compatibility with prior devices rather than moving up.Sound: The HDX has Dolby Digital Surround Sound; the Nexus has Frauenhofer Surround Sound; the iPad Mini has stereo sound. The iPad Mini also makes the same mistake that Amazon made in its first-generation tablet: putting both speakers on the same side (in this case, at the bottom of the tablet). If you're watching a video, you'll have the tablet turned sideways and the sound will all come from the same side. The HDX, in contrast, has the speakers placed perfectly for video watching.Networking: The HDX and the iPad Mini both have dual band, dual antenna (MIMO) Wi-Fi. The Nexus is dual band but not dual antenna. All things being equal, I would expect the Nexus to lag a bit behind the others in networking performance, particularly in areas where the connection is spotty.Size and Weight:HDX: 7.3\" x 5.0\" x 0.35\" and 10.7 oz.Nexus: 7.9\" x 4.5\" x 0.34\" and 10.24 oz.iPad Mini: 7.87\" x 5.3\" x 0.29\" and 11.68 oz.There's really nothing to choose from here. All three are small, thin, and light. The iPad Mini is the heaviest but it also has a slightly larger screen.Processor:HDX: 2.2 GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor, 2GB memoryNexus: 1.5GHz quad-core Snapdragon S4 Pro, 2GB memoryiPad Mini: 64-bit dual-core A7, 1GB memoryThe HDX and iPad come out ahead of the Nexus on processing power while the HDX and Nexus come out ahead of the iPad Mini on memory. The A7 is only a dual-core processor but according to some tech sites that have run benchmarks, it definitely holds its own against the quad-core Snapdragon. These are all pretty powerful tablets.Cameras: Both the Nexus and the iPad Mini have 1.2 MP front and 5MP rear cameras. The HDX only has a front-facing camera. If you expect to take pictures with your tablet, the HDX isn't for you.Battery Life: HDX = 11 hours (17 hours when reading); Nexus = 9 hours; iPad Mini = 10 hours. Amazon wins this one, particularly if you will be spending a lot of time reading.Expansion: None of them have a microSD slot; they all assume that you'll be using their respective cloud systems.Parental Controls: All of them have the basic parental controls that allow you to limit your child's access to content, purchases, the web, and so on. Amazon goes farther, though, with the Kindle Free Time and Kindle Free Time Unlimited options, the latter of which is an inexpensive subscription to a curated library of content. If you are buying a first tablet for a child, I'd choose the Kindle Fire HD. At only $139, it is significantly cheaper and it has all of the options that the HDX has.Enterprise: As soon as Amazon releases its update, it will add VPN and network printing support. I believe all of the tablets have basic enterprise capabilities, including that support and various office apps. For real productivity, though, personally I'd go with a laptop, not a tablet.Support: Amazon wins this category, hands down, with the new Mayday system. Apple comes in second, with Apple and Amazon usually taking top marks in any customer support survey. This is an area where Google does not shine.Price: The HDX and Nexus win this one, hands down. Both are priced at $229 vs. $399 for the new iPad Mini. Neither Google nor Amazon makes much, if any, money on their tablets; they're counting on you to purchase content from their respective stores.From my own perspective, there is no single clear winner, as each tablet has strengths and weaknesses. If you already have Amazon Prime, the HDX is a no-brainer, with the access to the Prime Instant Video and the Kindle Owners' Lending Library. If you're primarily buying a tablet to read with, Amazon wins there, as well, with the 17-hour battery life while reading and the best display for reading outdoors. If you want apps, Apple and Google both have far more choices. If you want to watch movies, I'd pick either the HDX or the Nexus, as Apple's aspect ratio and its lagging sound put it at the back of the pack. If price is a factor, then you should pick either the HDX or the Nexus.If you're heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem, i.e., you already own an iPhone or iPad and all of your content is on iTunes, the HDX really isn't the tablet for you. Similarly, if you love browsing Google Play for apps to play on your Samsung Galaxy phone, you're likely to be disappointed in the section available on Amazon (although, as I note above, most of the Google Play apps can be sideloaded onto the tablet). If you love your Google Now or Siri, neither of which will ever be available on Amazon, this isn't the tablet for you.The bottom line: This tablet is primarily intended as a viewport into Amazon content and Amazon services. If you have Amazon Prime and you have Amazon eBooks in your collection, this tablet is a no-brainer. The price is low, particularly for what you get, and it's a small, light, high-quality, high-powered, tablet with a stunning display and superb sound. This really is one of the top tablets in its class.Note: As others have noted, the tablet will update its software when you first turn it on and connect to wifi. Unlike some others, I had no trouble with this operation, no glitches or crashes. It took several minutes but the process ran smoothly, as did the tablet when everything was done.Update:Now that I have a Kindle Fire HD and a Kindle Fire HDX tablet, I'm in a little better position to talk about which one I'd recommend:You should get the Kindle Fire HDX if:- You're a techie who wants the latest and greatest, the best display, the fastest processor.- You need a camera for Skype or other video app.- You play graphics-intensive games (e.g., racing games).- The size and weight matter to you, even in such small increments as this.- You think you will need the Mayday technical support.You should get the Kindle Fire HD if:- Price is a factor. $90 cheaper is not an insignificant amount. This really is an excellent value for the money.- You want an inexpensive tablet for a child (and, for this case, the lack of a camera might well be a plus)- All you want is a basic tablet for reading books, playing music, watching the occasional video, playing Words with Friends, and the like. While the screen on the HD isn't as stunning as is it on the HDX, this is still a true HD screen and it is very good.I check back pretty regularly, so if you have a question, please feel free to ask and I'll do my best to answer it.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice Tablet with Sharp Display", "Author": "Michael Gallagher", "ReviewID": "R23F7ENQQQYOVN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "To sum up what I will tell you about in the details below, for $229 you are getting a good deal on a tablet computer - especially if you compare it to the $199 for last year's first-generation Fire HD and the $500 or more you can spend on a Wi-Fi version of the iPad. Overall, if you consider the price and the functionality I think this is a great tool / toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device: the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and the new HD Fire.  If you are a first-time tablet buyer, where price vs. value is a key consideration, or if you are looking for an affordable tablet for the kids, I'd recommend the \"regular\" Kindle Fire HD that is only $139.  If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of that one.My review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the Fire HDX to the original Fire HD as well as this year's model of the Fire HD, but also some of the features for a first-time user.Consistent with my experience with setup of this year's model of the Kindle Fire HD, setup took a long time: despite being a brand new product, the Fire HDX attempted to download and install several operating software updates.  Software updates on a Kindle are usually in the background, and it was annoying watching the crashes and manual reboots.  Consistent with the Fire HD, it crashed during setup, playing a song, watching a TV show, and reading a book.  It took a little over an hour to get this thing up and running without consistent crashes but after the final software update it has worked as expected without further issues.Screen Display / Video Playback:This version of the Fire has the absolute best screen display of any Fire model to date. Looking at the technical specs Amazon made some major changes in the display / resolution, and the picture appears more crisp: I compared the viewing experience watching with my standard test of the Fire devices over the past couple of years - don't laugh - the first episode of the Wonder Woman TV series from the 70's. The display on this Fire was one heck of a lot better in terms of sharpness than last year's model as well as this year's model of the Fire HD. For you technical folks out there, the display is 1,920 x 1,200 with 50% more pixels per inch than the Fire HD.Wi-Fi Connectivity:The initial Wi-Fi setup took some time as it wouldn't remember the password for my router after each software update / crash / reboot series.  After the final operating software update I mentioned above, however, it was fairly easy to connect to the Internet via Wi-Fi.My standard test for trying out new gadgets is to see how fast they run side-by-side with a known piece of equipment doing the same test at the best place of Wi-Fi in my house and the worst place where it drags. In this comparison, I had this HDX version of the Fire sitting next to last year's and this year's version of the HD Fire, as well as last year's 8.9\" HD Fire, Motorola RAZR smartphone, my iPad 2 (yes, the Kindle guy uses an iPad for work), and the first-generation 7\" Fire (the model from two years ago) all just using a Wi-Fi connection vs. cellular connectivity.My \"normal\" website test is to hit the mobile websites of FoxNews, CNN, my personalized Yahoo page, Google, and the Houston Chronicle. The ones that were usually slow on the other devices were faster on the HDX (Houston Chronicle and CNN), and for the other sites I couldn't tell a difference in speed at the location closest to my router. When I went to the slowest / worst reception location of my house, the speed did have a noticeable difference in the other devices as this one was a little bit faster than all but last year's model of the 7\" Kindle Fire HD; yes, it was also faster than this year's model of the Fire HD but I attribute the increase in speed to the dual antennas on the HDX.Sound / Music Playback:The two speakers are located in the back of the Kindle Fire in two not-noticeable ports: one on the top and one on the bottom. My test of this feature was cranking up Van Halen's Panama to maximum volume (I always want to see if it could really play the guitar licks), and I would alternate covering one speaker up over the other: you have true stereo sound with no degradation of the sound that makes you think you are about to blow the speaker.  The Dolby speakers sound nice and you do get to hear the bass.  However, I am still of the opinion the speakers aren't going to do very well being placed in the back as I am in the front: I want to be able to hear whatever I am listening to without really having to crank it up and disturbing someone else in the room (that's what happens when you start losing your hearing like I am).  While the cover for this version has not shipped yet - why aren't the covers released at the same time? - I imagine the sound quality might decrease with a cover in the back over the speakers.  The X-ray feature is pretty neat as it displays the lyrics on the screen if you are so inclined; if you are not, it is as simple as the tap of an icon to make the lyric feature go away.Email Setup:Consistent with previous versions of the Fire, email setup was very easy for my main Gmail account, both with the software came with the Fire but my primary use of an existing app called Enhanced Email I purchased here in the Amazon app store. I did setup the email app that came with the program with no problem - it took about a minute to setup my main Google account - and I was able to send and receive emails as well as synch my online calendar via Google's calendar and contacts. For those of you asking yourself why am I using the Enhanced Email program, the simple answer is like many of you I have more than one email account: you can quickly switch back and forth on the accounts with the tool. The lazy person in me appreciates that as I don't like getting out of the lazy chair once I'm settled in!New Tabs and Screen Layout:In addition to the normal tabs Amazon has continued to make tweaks with the look and feel to the overall display such as more things to scroll through to find what you are looking for in an easier manner. Interestingly, and consistent with my experiences with this year's model of the Fire HD, I purchased the one with special offers and the only ad I have seen so far is on the main screen saver vs. being overwhelmed with ads like last year's model.Reading Books:Turning pages is pretty darn easy - just tap the side of the screen to go to the next page or back a page, or you can swipe your finger across the screen to do the same.  Amazon did add the feature to see the book's description for books on your device like they have with the e-Ink Kindle (always an annoyance with last year's model), which is a plus as I can't remember what each book in my digital to-be-read pile is about; getting to the book description, requires several taps on the screen to eventually get to where you want to be.  If there is an easier way to do it, I can't find it and maybe I should be one of the first guys, ever, to crack open the electronic user's manual to figure it out (doubt it).  For those of you who have wondered, you still can't organize your books into categories unless you purchase a third-party app</a> here in the Amazon app store.BluetoothThere is a Bluetooth connection, and I did my usual test of this feature by taking it out to my car and having the Fire stream music through my car stereo. There were no delays or skips with the connection, and it paired up in about a minute. Just make sure you give it a device name so you can recognize it and be recognized.Camera:There is a camera on this model - it faces the front or toward the user / reader.  Focusing and taking a picture is pretty easy, and Amazon will by default store your pictures in the Cloud - which counts against your storage allotment.  I'd recommend turning that automatic storage feature off unless you are sure you want it, because if you go over the limit that will provide Amazon another opportunity to collect a monthly revenue stream from you.Charger:Unlike previous models of the Fire, this one DOES include a charger!  If you're scratching your head with that comment, in previous models you had to purchase a charger separately for $20 which always seemed kind of silly for Amazon to do.\"Mayday\" button:A new feature with this model, and not included on this year's \"regular\" model of the Fire, is the introduction of the \"Mayday\" button.  Basically, you can touch the button and a video screen will pop up and you can actually see - and talk to - a live customer service agent.  I haven't pressed the button yet to try it out, as I think I would feel pretty dumb: when they ask me how can they help, I don't want to say \"I just wanted to see if this works and just stopped by to say `hi' for purposes of this review.\"What I Wish it Had: a case that was ready to go and shipped when the Fire was ready (why are we waiting).  A case is very important in order to protect your investment.  Also, I'm interested to see how they try to not hurt the speaker's performance I mentioned above due to the speakers being in the back of the unit and hopefully not covered up with a case.Overall, at $229 for the 16GB of memory model ($309 for 64 GB of memory) I think this is a good deal for someone who really uses the video / apps feature. Kids will love it as they can read books, play games, watch TV and movies, and a whole lot of other things. Adults should like it for the exact same reasons, but while I try to minimize the amount of work-related stuff I do at home with the business apps that are available here in the Amazon App store and other places around the Internet I can also work on Excel and Word-compatible files when I have to without having to fire up my work laptop or whatever the case may be. If you've never owned a tablet before, or are looking to upgrade from an earlier model Fire, I would recommend this one if video and apps are your thing - but make sure you purchase the higher memory one vs. the minimum 16 GB.  If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, or looking for a tablet for your younger children, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of last year's model or get this year's model of the Kindle Fire HD at $139.", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing Performance Worthy of Upgrade", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Goode & Eiffel\"", "ReviewID": "R3IO1X1FKICIE8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Netflix Issue:When I first got the KFHDX, I had no problems with Netflix.

If you already enjoy the Amazon ecosystem, crave responsively fast performance, love gorgeous high resolution screens, wish the Kindle Fire were noticeably lighter, all without sacrificing battery life, while being able to enjoy more benefits of Amazon Prime, plus many other great new features, then stop reading, save time, and hit the \"Add To Cart\" button and buy it.I wanted the Amazon ecosystem. I am a Prime member. I also own a Nexus phone, the Sony Xperia Tablet Z, and a few other Android devices, besides the original Kindle Fire. I don't mind that Kindle Fires don't have Google Play. I have other devices for that. My wife has the iPad 4.If this is going to be your only Android device, then the decision point is which do you prefer, the Google experience or Amazon experience? You can get most of the Amazon experience with a more conventional Android device.  The overlap is not as great going the other way around. However, with the new Fire OS, you do get a few more Amazon exclusive experiences. Weigh your needs and wants to make the best choice.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**SERVICE: Amazon service applies directly to this device since it is their product. Amazon had a one day only FAA 15% off sale for some of the Kindles. I opened up the MayDay and asked the rep if they would honor the discount to those who had previously made the purchase. I was told it would only apply for those who had made the purchase within the last 7 days. That was not me. The MayDay rep didn't really do anything wrong, but she just appeared as if she didn't care and seemed a little annoyed at my request. Because the customer CAN see the MayDay rep, in my mind, it would be very important that person have a smile and warm demeanor. I've done tech support for a business I once owned, and a simple thing like this can make a huge difference in how a customer perceives a company.I had also emailed Amazon, received a reply with a number, and gave that a call. The initial rep was kind enough to refer me to someone who could make that decision. The manager I spoke with made the decision to honor a partial refund, even though the 64GB model I had purchased was not one of the sale items. I didn't get the full 15%, but it was about 12% discount. I thought this was more than fair and I appreciated the fact that Amazon allows their service managers the freedom to make these kind of decision.I believe there were two factors in play. 1. My standing with Amazon as a shopper (not that they don't care about all their customers, but it's nice to be appreciated for being a loyal customer!) 2. I was still within my return window. I could have sent it back, bought the sale version and still come out ahead, in theory. It would have been a headache and extra cost for all involved, and this service manager was keen enough to save us all that headache. Even if I had to go that way, it's still great service that I could return the device this long after the purchase, for any reason.If I could make one request, it would be that there was a dedicated link within Amazon Shop for writing reviews. I find typing to be one of the more accurate experiences on the Fire HDX, much improved over original Fire, and would like to be able to write reviews straight from the new Fire HDX.After about 1.5 months use, I have no buyer's remorse. This is a great tablet and a great buy for Amazon fans.====================FIRST IMPRESSIONS====================The packaging, for those of you who care, was like looking at movie poster. It got you interested, excited and ready to open it up. Once the cover was opened, box unsealed, and then opened, the inside was simple and elegant. Inside is the Kindle Fire HDX, the 5 watt charger (not 9 watt), and a nice thick 5 foot long USB to micro-USB cord. That's it.Compared to the original Kindle Fire, the HDX 7\" is noticeably lighter and easier to hold. The angled edge harmoniously eases the hand into a comfortable holding position. This is great to hold! When holding landscape mode, the top, where the speakers are, is smooth glossy plastic. It attracts fingerprints but it actually adds to the grip. The Amazon logo that is recessed in the back is also this same gloss and also helps make the device less slippery to hold. Well done. Fortunately, those are the only places that are glossy plastic.Turning on the device, Amazon already had associated the device with my account. The carousel was familiar. But swipe up and there was the typical icon view.Overall, the device is snappy and responsive. No more lag. I love it! The screen is gorgeous. It rotates quickly from landscape to portrait. It's the best rotating screen I've experienced on any Android device so far, and I've had my share of Android devices.There are a myriad of new features to learn from the upgrade. So far, I like them - a lot. The Mojito OS does take some exploring to get fully adjusted. I'm still in that process after two hours of playing around.====================THE DETAILS====================-------------------------APPS (Added 2 DEC 2013):-------------------------One of the biggest CONS people mention about the Kindle Fire line is the lack of Google Play, which primarily means limited app choices. This is true. There are apps I wish I could get on the Kindle Fire HDX. For some this may be a deal killer. For me, it is not.Amazon has really gone above and beyond to make the lack of Google Play so much easier to take. Since I purchased the Kindle Fire HDX, it came with 500 Amazon coins. Within the Amazon Apps world, this translates to $5.00 to spend on any app. In the month plus I've been an owner, Amazon has offered a ton of free apps, good ones! In some cases, they offered a free app, plus more free coins. There seems to be no shortage of ways to get free coins. Even when I do spend the coins (and not my real money yet,) I've made a handful of purchases where I got more coins back, in one case, 250 coins just for making my first purchase using coins. Some of these deals equate to discounts of 30% or more.My new Kindle Fire HDX is loaded with games and apps I'd likely not have purchased on my own. Between this give-a-way fest and their daily free apps, I have a lot of great choices for full paid apps. Not all the daily free apps are very good, but some are. It's worth checking out, especially during this Thanksgiving/Christmas time period.The Kindle Fire is meant for consumption and Amazon has done a great job making sure I can do just that without breaking the bank. Amazon makes up for its shortcoming in the apps department by being far more generous than Google is with their store.With the current Cyber Monday sale, the Kindle Fire HDX is a steal! Let me reinforce that the Snapdragon 800 processor/Adreno 330 combo is one awesome setup! It makes apps like Minecraft, RipTide 2 and others look gorgeous and perform without hiccup. It's no small deal that the top of the line hardware can be had for bargain hunter prices.----------TURN IT ON:----------The power button is on the left back side. It does take a moment to figure this out when being used to a button on the top or side has been the norm for so long. It's not a big deal, but surprising after forgetting for the first time.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**I still find the button on back to be somewhat clumsy. Even though the other side has two recessed buttons for the volume, it doesn't stand out enough for me. I'm still flipping the device back and forth at night with little or no light. Even in the day time or with light, I have to make a concerted effort to determine which way is up and remember that the power button is on the left. With my other devices, I just feel for the button and push.-----------------------------DOWNLOAD PRIME VIDEOS:-----------------------------This is the main reason I purchased the 64 GB WiFi version. First, I could take videos with me when I had no internet connection, such as in a car. Second, when my kids want to watch videos, I can download their favorites so they won't be hogging the bandwidth at home!How does this work? Go to the videos, choose the desired video and an option to download will be there. My first attempt to download a Prime video, I chose Downtown Abbey Season 3, Episode 1, which was 1:06 hours long. I was given three options: Standard Definition, 720P HD and 1080 HD. I selected the 1080P HD option first.My internet is 10 Mb/s DSL download speeds. I made it to about 44% downloaded after about 50 minutes. Of course, I kept on checking out other features during the wait. While trying to start Flick Soccer, the device locked up on me. I was stuck. I held the power button for a good while and it rebooted.The HDX then successfully upgraded the system, something that failed after my initial setup. Yes, an update already (for the Mayday button!) When I looked to see if the video was there, it was not. I had to start all over again. It didn't save.This time, I chose 720P HD. It took about 19 minutes to download. I was previously able to view the 1080P video while it was downloading. It looked awesome. The 720P HD looked just about as good. Some action scenes, I could tell it was lower quality, but not that noticeable. This 1:06 hour 720P HD video file consumed 1.24 GBs of space.Next I tried the SD, or lowest quality option and downloaded Episode 2. This took 5 minutes and 44 seconds. The SD video file size for a 1:06 episode was 267MB. The video was a tad blurry, more choppy during action, and more noise, grain and artifacts. However, for standard definition, it was surprisingly passable. Download your young kid's videos in SD and save some space. They won't care, and even you may not.Finally, I retried the 1080P video with Episode 3. This time, it took 44 minutes 38 seconds to successfully download. The quality, as mentioned before, was excellent. The colors were vibrant, the video sharp and fluid. It took up 2.07GBs of space.Here is the rundown. About 1 hour video episode of Downtown Abbey. 10 Mb/s DSL download speed.SD = 5:44 minutes to download. 267MB. Quite decent quality.720P = 19:12 minutes to download. 1.24GB. Very good quality.1080P = 44:38 minutes to download. 2.07 GB. Excellent quality.For those who are new to the Amazon world, yes, you can download the Netflix app and watch those, too, minus the download for later option.**UPDATE 23 OCT 2013**:Yes, there are 3 quality settings for downloading Prime Videos. After digging around, I found a few more choices.After swiping down system menu in the Home screen, go to:Settings / Applications / VideosHere you will see individual settings for HD and SD downloads. It turns out HD has 3 quality settings and SD has 3 quality settings.  I chose to ask for each setting.Also, in this menu, you will find the option for Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 Audio. Because this increases the size of the video while streaming, it is turned OFF by default. I turned it on and it does make a noticeable difference with surround sound effect, both with speakers and headphones. The video you are watching will need to support this feature.In this Video settings, there is also the option to clear video search history.Another discovery with Prime Video downloads is that most videos do have a time limit for viewing offline. As long as you connect back online, it resets that time, so not a big deal in most cases. So far, I've noticed videos such as \"Under the Dome\" have a 48 hour limit offline before needing to reconnect. Other videos have a 30 day window. It seems as if some of the kids' videos had no such time limit for offline viewing.**UPDATE 2 DEC 2013**I am discovering that not all Prime videos can be downloaded. This seems to be true with a lot of newer Prime movies and some TV shows. I'm hoping it is a licensing issue and not a decision made by Amazon. If possible, please make ALL Prime videos downloadable!I also find the ability to browse videos to be tedious. Similar to Netflix, on the Kindle devices, Amazon pushes out choices to you in limited quantities. If your watching habits change on any given day, you will need to really dig into the menu choices to see all the viewing options out there. The menu choices overlap and can make browsing confusing, and a challenge to track what one has already browsed.In the Videos, in the side menu under \"Prime Instant Video\" there are three main choices:Top TV ShowsTop MoviesFor the KidsWhat tipped me off, is under \"For the Kids\" there are very few choices. I knew from my Roku device and from browsing from a web viewer, there had to be more choices for the kids.Regardless of which of the three main categories one chooses, each has a sub-menu found by tapping the little down arrow that is right of the category description, such as:MOVIES (Upper left hand corner once this choice has been selected)Top Movies, Prime (Right under, MOVIE, in smaller letters) and the arrow is just right of this.Each main category has sub-menu items, as noted before. But each sub-menu also has the same choices. These would be the same regardless of which main category one came from. Hence, this is where some confusion can come into play.What each sub-menu has, within each main Prime category, is an option called, \"Genres.\"  This is where one needs to go to find the rest of the Prime viewing choices. Unfortunately, there are even more sub-categories within each Genre choice. One will never find all the choices in one place for mass browsing.Are you confused? That is my point. Browsing could be less confusing and easier to navigate.For these two points within Prime Video, I'd knock off a half star. But since I can't, I'll leave my rating at 5 stars because overall, I'm still very happy with the device.----------AUDIO:----------I found the speakers to have decent sound. It sounds a tad more fuller than my Sony Xperia Tablet Z, but iPad 4 is still much better and sounds louder. The new HDX is sufficiently loud enough while holding it, but I do wish it could go a notch or two louder. With my Klipsch X10i head phones, the sound was plenty loud. It sounded better than the speakers and was OK. It won't win over Audiophiles, but good enough for entertainment purposes.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**In Settings/Device/Applications/Videos Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 Audio is shut off by default. Turn it on. It improves the sound, especially with the built in speakers. I can actually sense a better surround sound effect in videos that support this.I find that the speaker sound is actually pretty good the more I use it. There is more meat to the sound than I initially thought. For personal use, the loudness is good in a quiet environment. The sound quality is good for a tablet. The sound stage is narrow. The surround sound effect, once turned on is decent. The simulated surround effect is noticed most of the time.I still think the iPad 4 has the best built in speakers I've heard on a phone or tablet. I listened to the built in speakers on the new iPad Air, and the Kindle Fire HDX is much better. The iPad Air built in speakers takes a big step back compared to the iPad 4. The Air also has mono speakers and it really sounds mono, in a bad way.**UPDATE 2 DEC 2013**Rather than relying strictly on my memory, I went back and tested the audio side by side with my wife's iPad 4. I would say the sound quality is about the same. What I overlooked was the fact the iPad 4 only has one external speaker. It is mono. In that regards, I give the nod to the Kindle Fire HDX. With some surround effect, once turned on, the HDX separates itself even more. From my own testing, the built in speakers are one of the best on any tablet or phone. The more I use it this way, the more I am enjoying it. In most cases where disturbing others is not a concern, I don't feel compelled to need headphones. If one does need a little bit louder sound, hold it with both hands from the top, and the sound reflects directly to you, making it sound a little louder. The decision to put the speakers on top in landscape mode, was a very good one.----------GRAPHICS:----------The HDX has the latest and greatest Adreno graphics to compliment the current king of the hill quad-core Snapdragon 800 2.2GHz processor. Yes, it is a huge upgrade from the original Kindle. Huge!Playing the Temple Run games, I'd get frustrated with the lag on the original Kindle Fire. No more lag. Graphics look great. No video tearing.In Minecraft PE, the original Kindle can play it, but It's not a great experience. The HDX plays it with the best Androids out there. Once again, the beautiful screen and powerful graphics chip makes playing Minecraft a joy, even with Amazon's highly skinned version of Android running it.----------SCREEN:----------The screen is sharp. Texts are very crisp. Colors are accurate and beautiful. There are no pixels to be seen by my naked eye.One nice surprise is that the screen itself seems to be somewhat oliophobic. While fingerprints are there, they seem to disappear some. It is one of the better screens for this, at least that is my initial impression. I don't think this was even intended. I'll revisit this later with more time.The screen is glossy. It does reflect a lot. But once turned on, it can be noticeable, but also easily forgotten. If you are prone to glare and easily distracted by it, keep this in mind.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**After further use, I still think the Kindle Fire HDX screen is one of the best screens in terms of keeping it clean. It does collect finger oils, but I find it still keeps on cleaning off easier than any other device I've ever used. I don't even need a special cloth. Just by cleaning it off with the palm of my hands, the screen looks nearly clean again!----------MAYDAY:----------Yes, I tried it. I really had a question! No, really! I knew that while reading a book, the HDX could have its contrast adjusted for better reading in sunlight, as well as longer battery life. I looked everywhere how to get to this setting. I couldn't find it.I opened up the Mayday feature and waited about 30 seconds to connect. After confirming my email, address and name associated with my account, I was asked how they could help. With the speaker on full volume, I had a difficult time hearing the female tech, Celeste. I asked her my question and she did need to seek help to find the answer, but I got the answer. She was friendly. I could move the little window wherever I wanted. At one point, she took control of the screen.The answer was that the screen brightness setting had to be set to auto and it would then recognize when to make the adjustments while reading.It might seem a little daunting to do tech support via video conference. Don't worry. The video is one way. They don't ever see you. The tech can only see your screen.The Mayday button is added with the first initial system update, which should take place during the setup. But if it failed the first time like it did for me, you won't see it when swiping down for the settings on top of the screen. Manually update the Kindle by swiping down the top and finding it in the settings.I really don't see Mayday being a feature I'll need much, but it's a nice touch for the tech challenged.----------X-RAY:----------This could be one of the most underrated features. I didn't bat an eye about it before the purchase. Now, I think it is really useful and can see myself turning to it all the time.In movies, tap the video screen and X-Ray pops up on the left side. X-Ray detects which characters are in the current scene and you can find out more about the actor. Trivia facts are also there. It's like watching a DVD with narration on, only much less annoying and much smarter.In the Music player, X-Ray provides scrolling lyrics that follow the song as it goes. If you are a karaoke fan (I am not much so) then you will love this.Yes, even in some books, X-Ray is there. It provides footnote like data about characters and terms. I've only seen it in the book Les Miserable. There could be more. I'm guessing it depends on what the publisher provides.----------------SILK WEB BROWSER:----------------It's pretty fast for an Android tablet. On a tablet, I still find the Ipad 4 is the best experience with Safari. There is the option for mobile website, desktop version, or automatic. This is a bit misleading. I prefer desktop version of websites. However, with Silk, you won't get a real desktop experience. Silk still customizes the website to fit the HDX screen. The accuracy will depend on each website.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013***I find I don't use the Silk Browser much unless I need to quick look something up. I really wish the option to have a full desktop view did just that. On some of my sites, like Yahoo, it does a bad job of rendering pages. I may have to side load Chrome.---------------KINDLE FREETIME:---------------I just set up Kindle FreeTime. I did the Family Plan for up to 6 kid profiles for $6.99 a month. The other option is for one child for $2.99 a month.Once I set the age (but not actual birthdays, just close to their age) for each child, and subscribed to the unlimited family plan, I tried using it.It was a bit confusing at first. I wanted to set the content for each child. I couldn't find all these \"unlimited\" apps, books and videos for kids. I could only see what was already on my device or what I owned in the cloud.Only when I actually logged in as one of my kids, did I see all the kid's content I had subscribed. There were plenty of choices. The initial choices were for me to determine what I wanted my kids to be able to access that was for my main account. No, I don't want them to have access to all me and my wife's content. But yes, I do want them to have access to other apps and videos we already purchased. That was what the initial content filtering was all about.My first impression of Kindle FreeTime is that I may end up having to buy each kid their own Kindle. I can see them fighting over MY, I stress MY, Kindle HDX. I may never see it again once I let them on it. I think it's going to be that good. Thankfully, I can set time limits for them!**UPDATE 23 OCT 2013**:I could not download videos for offline use within FreeTime. That seems to be an Amazon Prime video benefit.Only certain books could be downloaded and viewed while offline.I did like that some books can be set to have a narrator read the books to the young child. This is good for my 3 year old. He loves the Thomas books that do this.------------BATTERY LIFE:------------The HDX came with about 60% charge. I'm making an educated guess since it was a graphic meter that is the default battery indicator. I changed it to show percentage after I'd used the Kindle for a short while. It had 54% by that time. After about 4.5 -5 hours of very heavy usage setting up, testing and downloading, I'm at the last 1%.After completely draining the battery to where it shut off by itself, here is what I've been able to measure for recharging with the standard 5 watt included charger, which does eat up 2 outlets on an older power strip:15% in 28:44 minutes30% in 1:00 hour40% in 1:22 hours50% in 1:42 hours60% in 2:03 hours70% in 2:21 hours90% in 3:05 hours95% in 3:15 hours100% in 3:34 hours Whew!Note: There is no indicator light to show charging status.**UPDATE 25 OCT 2013**:I let my kids use the new Kindle Fire HDX during a 4 hour trip to visit family. With some video, lots of multiplayer MineCraft use, it lasted from Noon to 9 PM with about 35% battery life left. It wasn't on all the time, but it was being used frequently.In a more detailed drain test, here are the results:5:41 Hours = 100% Brightness playing constant video (downloaded)9:28 Hours = 50% Brightness playing constant video (downloaded)During the 50% brightness test, it took 4:52 hours to drain down to 50% battery life. It took 4:36 minutes to drain from 50% down to 0% where it powered off on its own.50% brightness is still viewable even in a well lit room. However, I'd at least go 70%. In dimly lit areas with some light, 50% is plenty bright.The Kindle HDX is very efficient with power. It barely warms up and it never gets hot. The claimed rating of 11 hours with mixed use seems about right and that's using it constantly. With light to medium use, one could easily go a full day and likely two or three away from a power source.----------------------------HOW MUCH MEMORY SHOULD I GET:----------------------------The base model with 16GB memory is $229. To double that memory to 32GB costs another $40. Compared to Apple's memory upgrade practice, this is a cheap upgrade. To quadruple the base memory of 16GB to 64GB costs $80. This is the best value if you are going to upgrade the internal storage size. Here's why:$2.50 per GB to add 16GB storage to base model for a total of 32GB.$1.67 per GB to add 48GB storage to the base model for a total of 64GB.I got the 64GB model because I am a content lover. I love choice. I love freedom to use even when speedy internet is not available. I want to be able to download videos for my kids when travelling in the car. Even at home, I'd rather they view videos locally from a device so I don't have to fight bandwidth with them! Data these days can add up fast. 8 GB on original Kindle Fire was definitely not enough for me. The new HDX can't be upgraded later, so I did it now. 64 GB was the cheapest upgrade option per GB. Your reasons may vary, but maybe that will help you decide what's best for you just in case you haven't thought about a few of those points.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**If you want to save some money, the 32GB should be enough for most people. I consider myself a heavier user. I currently have about 17 episodes (most an hour episode) and 2 full length movies, all in 720P HD and I have 31.5GB space left. I haven't loaded my own videos yet, but that is something I plan on doing. I'm glad I got 64GB.For those of you that don't care about storing large files on the Kindle device, the 16GB should suffice. If you change your mind down the road, you'll need to buy a whole new device, so be sure of what you want. I will say that I'm glad 8GB option is gone. That just didn't cut it.If you are buying for kids, 16GB could be enough. Download videos in SD and it will save a lot of space and still be decent viewing quality. Also, with some diligence, simply delete content you've watched and you'll get that space back. If you can live without the convenience and willing to work at it a bit, 16GB is still a good choice. For kid use with SD video, the 32GB option will give you ample room for the convenience factor.-----------------------------------SPECIAL OFFERS OR NO SPECIAL OFFERS:-----------------------------------I opted to keep the special offers. Why? Because, they don't bother anyone. You'll only see them from time to time on the screen lock when you first turn the HDX on. Special Offers don't show up at any other time when you are using the device. If you like Gold Box deals, supposedly, some of these offers can be exclusive and even better deals. Why not? I'll save $15 for that. I think people make way too big a fuss over this. Spend that money on some apps, songs or other content. The fun you'll get from that will far outweigh the seeing a few ads that barely intrude on your life.----------PORTS:----------I have noticed that plugging in both the head phone jack and the micro-USB port requires going in at a slight angle. The angle matches the angled edges of the Kindle HDX. Don't force it in straight on! Be gentle at first until you get the feel of it.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013***After almost a month and a half, I find the micro-USB power port to remain a tight and secure fit. It's one of the most secure feeling connections I've felt for a micro-USB device. We'll see how it holds up after more time.----------------------KINDLE ONLY EXCLUSIVES:----------------------Try watching Amazon Prime videos from an Android device post ICS. Google doesn't support Adobe Flash in Android any more. I find it frustrating. I can watch Amazon Prime videos from my Kindle devices.I am one that does like to listen to my books while driving. You can't do this from the Kindle app on other Android devices. Text to speech only works on actual Kindle devices. I'm not sure if the text to speech voice changed with the Mojito OS, but I like the new voice better. It is still mechanical, but much better. My only gripe is that the text to speech shuts off if you manually turn a page and when screen rotates. Please change this! Let text to speech stop when I choose to stop it, especially when driving in a car.====================PARTING THOUGHTS====================The Kindle 7\" HDX is meant for consumption of content for Amazon lovers. It excels at this in almost every way, from hardware to software. If you love Amazon, absolutely get it. Navigating Amazon's skinned Android is simple and easy to use, but not meant for the tinkerer. It's definitely not Apple in design. But, it is functional. It knows what it is and the latest Kindle Fire HDX, to me, is even more exciting than the original. The improvements are that good.====================PROS & CONS====================PROS:o Top of the line hardware, super fast and responsiveo Gorgeous screen for both resolution and coloro Screen handles fingerprints very wello Lightweight and easy to holdo Download Prime Videoso Long battery lifeo Crisp text for readingo Great price for the hardwareo Kindle FreeTime for the kidso Parental controlso X-Ray provides useful information for video, music and bookso Kindle exclusive featureso Mayday offers free support and helpCONS:o Back power and volume buttons need getting used too Speakers sound OK, but could be a little loudero Text to speech in books stops with screen rotation or manual turn of pageo No rear camerao No HDMI out porto No GPSo No Google Play", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Blue/purple border on white pages!", "Author": "LindaFus \"lindafus\"", "ReviewID": "RXJ3VD36FN0O2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased my Kindle Fire HDX from Best Buy. After trying to read a book, I noticed a pretty bright blue/purple streak that never went away on the sides of the pages. Going into Sepia and changing the background pages did not help this issue.  I called Amazon and they replaced it with a new one. The new one has the same blue/purple border on white and light background pages. The Amazon replacement is more subtle and even around the edges, so I opted to return the one that had the darker boarder.I now see on Amazon's  description of the Kindle Fire HDX that they actually mention this defect as being normal and I quote below:----------------We want you to know...\"The Kindle Fire HDX 7\" has perfect color accuracy (100% sRGB), and we wanted to share more details around our display design decisions that helped us achieve this.You may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. All displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy. Most LCD displays use white LEDs, and then apply filters to extract the desired color. The result is oftentimes a compromise to tone and color accuracy, or--if attempting to address these compromises--an increase in battery consumption and, thus, device weight.We've taken a different approach. To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7\" at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20% improvement in power efficiency.\"---------------This glow is not light nor is it narrow.  The text of a book runs through this and it is very uncomfortable to read this way. This is also true for the Silk Web browser.  I will keep my Kindle Fire for a bit and see how this all pans out with Amazon.  Buyer beware:  Reading with this blue/purple glow is not the same as it is on your Kindle HD or older.After stating the above, I will say, other than this serious screen flaw, this device runs everything else flawlessly and I love streaming movies on this device. Netflix runs great as does Amazon Prime movies. Apps load instantly and web pages as well. This screen issue not so much. I am a bit confused as to why Amazon thinks this blue/purple haze is ok.  I will try to get used to it.", "Date": "October 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Most amazing device I've ever owned!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1NFRVWEUS01UH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm 64 years of age and a teacher. I am no techie, but really enjoy the electronic gadgets that are being invented these days. I preordered and purchased the very first generation Kindle 2 years ago and felt that it was time for an upgrade. This time, I waited a couple of days to see how it was received by the public and to catch a few of the early reviews before deciding to order. I'm sorry I waited. This tablet is AMAZING for my purposes! It is designed for media consumption and anyone who purchase it ought to be aware of it. It does a great job in that aspect.The \"purple haze\" a number of reviewers have complained about seems quite inobtrusive to me. I don't know that if I were not previously aware it would even be in the discussion. It is a very faint, but discernible border around thedevice when reading.  I haven't found it to be annoying at all and shouldn't be a deal-breaker.I use the device for reading of books and magazines, watching movies and television shows, playing games, e-mail and light surfing of the web. I'm even able to download my students' grades and attendance records from the school web site more rapidly than my hardwired computer in my workplace! The screen picture is more than outstanding...it is unbelievable! The keyboard appears when it is supposed to and is very responsive, just like the rest of the touch screen. And lest I forget the Mayday button, this whole concept is unreal, when I consider the time spent with most customer service outfits on the phone line waiting for my cal to be answered. Great job, AmazonDownloads of movies and games are quick. I have installed Netflix and Hulu Plus on the device and they work flawlessly with the device. As a Prime member as well, it works seamlessly. My digital subscriptions to several magazines were a snap to transfer to this device. All in all, my expectations were far exceeded by the product.The device is lightweight, beautiful and so cool I purchased an inexpensive ($4.95) case on line from Poetic that provides a lightweight shell and keeps the sleekness of the device intact, yet still allows me to prop it up for video viewing. It also puts the device in sleep mode when the cover is closed and the device immediately awakes when the cover is opened.While I understand the criticism, why buy the device if you knew it's limitations? It is the best at what it is supposed to do and the price when compared to other tablets on the market is a steal, if you consider what it is able to do (and not what it WASN'T supposed to do.In summation, if you are not a techie and just like to relax with a movie, read a book or magazine or play a game, start ordering your HDX now. Media doesn't have to cost you a fortune, is thousand of books I have ordered over the years have been free, and for a couple of hundred dollars a year I and my wife get all the video we want for all our devices from Prime, Netflix and Hulu +. It's the best toy I ever bought. Final rating: 9 out 0f 5!!!!!", "Date": "November 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best 7\" tablet on the market?", "Author": "J. Chambers", "ReviewID": "R3N1QB8TWW0WRJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "NOTE: This review is for the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" tablet with 32GB, special offers, and Wi-Fi only.I pre-ordered both the original Kindle Fire and the Kindle Fire HD 7\" tablets when they were first announced. It was love at first swipe. The second generation HD was a huge advance over the first generation, with the welcomed addition of an external volume control, an HDMI port, and higher screen resolution. The HDX is also a big step-up from its predecessor. The most obvious improvements:* Higher resolution - 1920x1200 (323 ppi) in the HDX versus 1280x800 (216 ppi) in the HD. That's a huge difference, especially when viewing HD videos. The HDX has a new graphics processor that Amazon says has 4X the performance of the HD.* Faster processor - a 2.2GHz quad-core Snapdragon processor in the HDX versus 1.5GHz dual-core processor in the HD. This is really advanced hardware for a tablet, putting the HDX at the high-performance end of the tablet market. Also, the HDX has 2GB of RAM, compared to the HD's 1GB.* Longer battery life - 11 hours (up to 17 hours in a \"reading mode\") for the HDX versus 10 hours for the HD.* Lighter weight - 10.7 ounces for the HDX versus 13.9 ounces for the HD. That's a noticeable difference when you're hand-holding the Fire. The weight reduction comes from a magnesium body covered with a rubbery material that's easy to grip. The shape is different, too, with beveled edges that help with hand-holding the HDX, since your fingers curl around it better. Also, the speakers have been moved from their position in the HD to the top of the beveled section (in the landscape orientation). This is a nice improvement from the HD, since your fingers won't cover the speakers in the HDX. And speaking of audio, X-Ray lyrics for my downloaded songs is a really cool feature. Really cool.* I like the new display. The display on the HD was the carousel filling most of the home page. This is still the default on the HDX, but swiping upward fills the screen with apps instead.* The power button and volume control have been moved. I hated the ones on the HD. They were hard to see and hard to find by feel. On the HDX, the concave buttons are on either side of the tablet when it's held in landscape position. It's not perfect, but I like it better.Those improvements alone make the HDX worth upgrading from the HD in my opinion. My biggest frustration with the HD was how the Silk browser was unresponsive sometimes, sitting there while I tapped a link several times. Occasionally, rebooting got the browser back on track, but it was frustrating. I've been using the HDX's browser for several hours, and it's been very smooth and responsive so far.I've already noticed a lot of fairly minor changes from the HD. For one, they've tweaked the virtual keyboard a bit. The most obvious change was to kill the long-press apostrophe from the period key. Now the apostrophe is on the numerical keyboard. It's not a big deal, it just takes some getting used to. Also, from some of the first reviews of the HDX that I read, some users are complaining about a purple border around web pages. To be honest, I barely noticed it. It's a very light purple about a tenth of an inch wide on my HDX. I don't know why it's there, but it doesn't bother me.Amazon will now allow some Prime Instant Video movies and TV shows to be downloaded onto the HDX and viewed later. I haven't tried this yet (and I don't know how you identify these videos if this feature is active), but it may be a good enough reason to go with the 32GB or 64GB versions of the HDX if you watch a lot of videos and aren't always connected to Wi-Fi. By the way, the HDX's memory is in a single partition where you can store anything, including books/audio books/magazines, apps, music, and videos. With my 32GB version of the HDX, about 25GB was free when I got the device.The most innovative new feature in the HDX is the \"Mayday\" button. Amazon says this will connect you with a real person who can in real-time walk you through a problem. (You must have an active internet connection to do this.) I just had to try it, so I did. \"Katie\" came online in just a few seconds, and after verifying my name, home address, and email address, she helped me with a couple of questions I had. That's remarkable customer service.As good as it is, though, the HDX isn't perfect. Here are my biggest disappointments:* They took the HDMI port away. Granted, with Prime streaming videos and our Roku box, I didn't use it often, but I wish it was still there. Amazon has announced that there's a software update coming that will let you send video through a PlayStation 3 or to certain Samsung TVs, but I don't have either of those.* There's still no GPS in the Wi-Fi HDX, although unless you have the 4G model (which includes GPS), it doesn't matter so much. In any case, you can still use apps like MapQuest for trip planning.* No speech recognition. I really hate this. Without this feature, there won't be any cool apps like Apple's Siri or Android's Speaktoit Assistant. Actually, you can install Speaktoit Assistant from the Amazon appstore, but you have to type in commands instead of speaking them. (Note: I read somewhere that it's possible to download Google Voice Search from the Google Play store, enabling speech recognition on the Kindle Fire.) There is a microphone, though, so you can use voice recorder apps and music recognition apps like Shazam and SoundHound.But despite a few disappointments, I'm generally very pleased with the HDX. It's a superb tablet. Although the Amazon appstore is still dwarfed by Google Play, Amazon's vast media library of books and magazines, videos, and music more than makes up for fewer apps, at least for me. The very smooth Silk web browser is greatly improved, and setting up email accounts and using email is very easy.I haven't bought a cover for the HDX, although I'm sure I will, since my old HD case won't fit the HDX. Amazon has its \"Origami\" case, and other companies are already advertising their HDX cases, but I'll wait a month or two and see what all is out there before buying one. Fortunately, the HDX's size is close enough to the HD's that the padded sleeve I got for the HD is big enough for the HDX.And a pleasant surprise: Kindles always ship with a USB charging cable, but I was surprised to see a wall charger in the box too.Bottom line: I really like the HDX, and for me it was worth the upgrade from my year-old HD.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not Worth the Aggravation of the Connection Problems", "Author": "Wayne \"wyadams\"", "ReviewID": "R31UC33XHKN8MS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It seems that Amazon is aware that the Kindle Fire has problems connecting and staying connected to wireless networks, and has chosen to ignore the problem and continue to sell this piece of garbage.

It disconnects from our network at random times, and at other times will not connect at all, sometimes for an entire day. At the same time this is happening, I am sitting next to her using my Motorola Xoom which has a good strong (four bars), stable connection, so it is not a network problem, it is a device problem. In fact no other wireless device on our network has EVER had connection problems.My recommendation is to find some other HD tablet and wait for Amazon to get the message that they can't foist this kind of garbage on the public and expect us to buy it.In addition, though the display and sound are excellent, there is not enough difference between the Fire and other HD tablets to make it worth the aggravation and hours of dead time.

In my mind the fact that that the screen flaw is most apparent when using the Kindle as an e-reader (one of it's marquee features) points to a critical failure in Amazon's QA process for this device.  Frankly, Amazon should be embarrassed.I debated between exchanging the device and returning.  For my sake and Amazon's I've decided to return it.  I don't want to go through multiple exchanges to find a screen without this flaw.  Also, reports of Amazon's customer service rationalizing this screen defect as \"normal\" puts a bad taste in my mouth because it reminds me of all the rationalizations and backpedaling Amazon went through with respect to the very real issues the first generation Kindle Paperwhites had with defective front lit screens that had green/pink blotches.I'll consider repurchasing what is otherwise a great 7 inch tablet when Amazon officially acknowledges the screen issue as a defect and confirms that it has rectified the problem either in software or in the manufacturing process.tl;dr version -- Amazon claims the Kindle Fire HDX screen is the best available.

Cody wrote me an email and tried calling twice as a follow up.  He was able to demonstrate that I could keep my magazine collection on the new Kindle HDX (Solution: once the magazine is downloaded, press and hold the issue until a pop-up window appears.  Select \"Keep\" and the issue will be kept indefinitely).  I now have my complete collection of PC magazines on my HDX available when needed.Prompt customer service can change a bad situation into a good one, and in this instance that has happened.  The original review was posted on Sunday and Cody had responded on Monday, the following day.  As a loyal customer, I appreciate the effort by Amazon to provide quality customer service.  I know it's not cheap.As a result, I have changed my rating from two stars to four.  If I could bifurcate my rating, I would give customer service five stars and the HDX four.  Specific to the HDX, the battery life seems to be shorter.  I only get 2 days of mild usage, whereas I could go 5 with the original Fire.  It also has some idiosyncratic features I'm not certain I like (e.g., using the camera to automatically power on if the cover is opened, which would impact battery power), though I have not been able to investigate whether this is an option that can be toggled off.Thank you, Amazon, for your excellent customer service.I hope this helps.ORIGINAL REVIEW: Magazine Subscribers BEWARE - I recommend you NOT buy this KindleORIGINAL RATING: ** out of 5For anyone not planning on purchasing or subscribing to magazines or newspapers, you can skip this review.  But I strongly feel I need to let potential buyers know that Amazon has implemented an arbitrary cap on the number of magazine issues you can download to your Kindle: two.TWO!!I own the first generation Kindle Fire and when I originally purchased a magazine subscription, it informed me the Fire would keep 6 issues and then begin removing them as new ones arrived (I actually have 8 on the Fire right now).  I understood the original Fire only had 8GBs of storage.  I reasoned, 'Amazon is limiting the number of issues because of the limited storage space.'  I got it.  In fact, when I purchased the HDX I bought the 64GB version (the max available) so I could maximize the amount of information I could carry.  I should mention I bought the 7\" HDX, 64GB and the non-4G version.I received my HDX Friday night and by Saturday morning was downloading my magazines.  I thought, 'Finally, I'll get access to my whole library if I ever need it.' I subscribe to PC magazines which contain tips, how-tos, troubleshooting advice, software reviews, etc.  Since my friends realize I'm a PC hobbyist, I often get asked PC questions and many times I know I've read the answer, so I just need my magazines to be available to find it.  Obviously, if one of the first things I did was begin downloading my magazines, it was a major reason why I purchased the HDX.  But, I digress.As fast as I was downloading, I realized they were disappearing on my HDX.  I finally realized there was some cap to the number of issues and the default was \"two\", so all I needed to do was adjust it...but I couldn't see how.I could not believe that I would be using Mayday one day after I received the HDX, but there I was.  To Amazon's credit, Wilfredo (Mayday assistant) and Mike (technical support) were both professional and courteous.  And I believe they were equally surprised that I could only download two issues to the HDX at a time.So, as it is right now, Amazon has implemented a software cap on Newsstand (which includes magazines and papers) of 2 issues per subscription.  Why?  I have no idea (and neither did anyone else I spoke with at Amazon).  It doesn't make sense.  Could you imagine if Amazon placed a limit of 2 on everything (2 albums from a single artist, or 2 books from a single author)?By writing this I want to warn customers and I hope Amazon will see it and remove the silly limit.SO...how'd I come up with a 2-star rating?First, I don't plan on returning it (if I did, it would receive 1 star).  I will use this for more than my magazines and from the looks of the other reviews, it performs admirably in all the other functions. Per Amazon, 3 stars indicates \"it's okay\"; and since it is NOT okay to me, I can't give it a 3 star rating.  2 stars means \"I don't like it\" which right now is the appropriate rating:  with this 2 issue limit, I do NOT like the HDX - it's a horrible restriction and it needs to go.I hope this helps.", "Date": "October 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great value for the price!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R16KKIG549WA3I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "GRAPHICS DISPLAY:  In one word and considering the price for this tablet---WOW.  With 323ppi, the 7\" HDX blows away the 1st gen iPad mini and even the latest iPad Air and is on par (within 3ppi) with the upcoming iPad Mini Retina and matched evenly with the Nexxus 7.PERFORMANCE:  This one is fast.  I have a 4th gen iPad that stops/slows down during certain games.  Not with the Kindle HDX.  No slow down or crashing at all.  I can wiz through the menus, the web, and within apps and entire experience is fast and responsive.SIZE/WEIGHT: Admittedly, I would have preferred a display closer to 8\", but the 7\" size is definitely not much of a sacrifice, considering the feather weight of this tablet and ease in wrapping my hand around the edges of both sides.VIDEO:  It was probably the new option to download some Prime video content for use when not connected via Wi-Fi that influenced me most in my decision to buy this latest generation of the Kindle Fire.  Not every video has this option, as it's my understanding Amazon is working to secure permissions from the various movie studios, but it's available on enough content right now that I had no problems finding several movies and TV shows to download for use when not connected.  Plus, the integration of video content with IMDB is neat. I bought a 32GB unit, mostly in anticipation of downloading Prime video content for use offline.  if you plan to download much content, I would urge you to consider either the 32 or 64GB models, as 16GB fills up fast, especially if downloading HD versions of movies and TV shows.AMAZON EXPERIENCE:  If you are entrenched in a lot of the Amazon universe---Prime, Kindle, Audible, and Amazon MP3 music it makes for a beautifully integrated experience.  In addition, the Amazon App Store contains most of the biggest, most popular games and apps that can be downloaded and used on the Fire.  Granted, not every Android app found on Google Play is available in the Amazon App store, but for me personally, the ones I use on a daily basis are there.PRICE:  When considering the technical specs and user experience, you'd be hard pressed to beat the price.  I purchased my Kindle HDX last week and then yesterday when Amazon announced 15% off special,  I logged into Amazon. com and chatted with a rep and they happily applied the discount retroactively to my order, so got my 32GB HDX for $228.65.  I fully expect Amazon to do something similar around the holidays to entice more sales.WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE? Amazon gives you a 30 day return window, so if you're on the fence about this, I'd say go for it and see how much you like it.  If it's not for you, Amazon has one of the smoothest, easiest, fastest return systems I've ever dealt with.WHAT ABOUT THE BLUE TINTED EDGES?  It does exist...but it has absolutely no impact on my viewing pleasure.  I read my Kindle content via a black screen with white lettering, because it's easier on my eyes, so I don't even see the tint when reading which is where I have heard the majority of complaints.  I can see it if I look hard on a web page, but for me it just doesn't register.  Your mileage may vary and that's why you have a 30 day return policy.BATTERY LIFE: I'm getting about 6-7 hours of use per day while connected to wi-fi and with streaming a few hours of video & several hours of online game play. It could be better, but I'm able to do what I need to on a daily basis and I just charge it nightly, or after heavy use. It seems to be a little slower charging though than last year's Kindle Fire HD, so overnight charging is best.DISCLAIMER:  I enjoy tech, but I am by no means overly attached to any one manufacturer or OS.  Personally, I own an iPad 4th Gen, Kindle Paperwhite 1st Gen, Samsung Note 3 mobile phone, and now a Kindle Fire HDX.  I love each device for what I use it for, regardless of whether it's Apple iOS, Android, or Amazon.

At first I thought its small size & light weight was indicative of poor quality, but I was so wrong!  This device is a powerhouse and now I appreciate its smaller size and weight.  I can use it for hours without straining my hands.  Now my older KFHD feels as heavy as a brick!Watching videos on this device is such a treat!  The color is gorgeous, vivid and vibrant.  The picture is amazingly clear and sharp.  This screen puts my first generation KFHD to shame!  As an Amazon Prime subscriber, I'm able to download Prime videos instead of just streaming them, which really comes in handy when I'm away from WiFi.  There's a huge selection of t.v. episodes available for download, and you can choose which picture quality you prefer (the higher the quality the more time it takes to download & the more space it uses).  I find that the videos use up a lot of storage space but you can easily delete them once viewed.The pictures that I downloaded from Facebook,  as well as all the screenshots I took, are GORGEOUS!  Their clarity & rich color is amazing!I feel the sound quality isn't as good as on last year's model, and it doesn't get as loud as I would like.  And that is really my only complaint.  A good set of ear buds makes a HUGE difference though.It loads web pages, videos & apps EXTREMELY fast, literally in a blink of the eye!  What a pleasure this is compared to the first generation KFHD, where you just watch that circle going around and around.  This is due to the speedy 2.2GHx quad-core processor which is advertised as being the fastest processor available on a 7 inch device.I find this device extremely responsive to touch, more so than the first generation model.  You can make the items in the carousel (which is a collection of every book, app, video, and song recently purchased or accessed) literally fly by.  In addition to the carousel, the \"home screen\" (which is what you'll see when the device is powered on), allows you to place your favorite items underneath the carousel for quick and easy access.  I love the new feature which allows us to view and access recently used apps & books with a quick swipe to the left without having to exit & go back \"home\" first.This device has no problem finding and connecting to WIFI automatically, and I have yet to receive an authentication error which happens frequently on my first generation KFHD.I've used the Mayday button twice, and my first attempt was aggravating because there was so much static, but my second experience was wonderful, with a friendly, knowledgeable agent.Some people are complaining about it taking so long to charge & then not holding the charge very long, but so far my device charges pretty quickly, even when I use it while it's charging.  I get approximately 8 to 9 hours of use per full charge, depending, of course, on how it's being used.I can't wait until mid-November, when a software update will give us the ability to sort our content into collections!!I highly recommend this little gem, which has been attached to my hand since I took it out of the box!!  :)", "Date": "October 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "UPDATE 11/8 - NEW hdx - Same Problem - Four Stars - But Returning It Bcz Blue Tinge Border Very Distracting", "Author": "Expert Reader 1 \"Spot On Review\"", "ReviewID": "R37EYAZC7C81NR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Got it today.

I LOVE AMAZON. I am a big fan.  But this is a clear design flaw or manufacturing flaw.MY EDUCATED GUESS is that this is Amazon contractor manufacturing versus Amazon engineering department fighting in the background.  Since Amazon's contracting factories already produced millions, Amazon doesn't want this as a 'defect' fight in the public eye.  Amazon is taking a page from the iPhone Antenna debacle.  Remember when Apple claimed it wasn't a design flaw, but quickly redesigned it for the newly manf. units?  Remember when Amazon had a bleeding light issue with generation 1 Paperwhite Kindle?  It spinned that too, then fixed it.While Amazon is spinning this as acceptable.  It's not for me.  Nor will it be for a significant number of people.  It's too distracting.  Amazon will fix it.  I'm sure they are scrambling like mad.  So I'm returning mine until they do.  Sucks because the device is great.  The Mayday is an outstanding innovation.  Though I wish it had a rear facing camera!!Ok.  I ordered a 64gb version today HOPING that it will NOT have blue tinged screen.

Lipphardt", "ReviewID": "R32KOT5ABY3B34", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have several items I use to read Kindle books and watch movies on.  One was the HDX 7.  I also us a second gen Nexus 7 and iPad Mini Retina.  Often I use a smartphone, like a Note 3 or Icon.  I will compare the HDX7 to these.First is screen.  I nailing this because this is the big problem.  This is supposed to be a book reader.  But that purple/violet glow intruding into the readable space is awful.  And it does not disappear regardless of your background settings - black, amber (my favorite) or white, it's always there.  Sadly it's MOST apparent in amber, which color is otherwise the easiest on your eyes.As a video display device, for movies and such it seems much better.  I suspect it's just not as noticeable with things going on on-screen.  It's there, but doesn't seem as bothersome.  But the screen is why I returned it.  Of the devices I mention, the best screen by a long way is the Nexus 7.  It's a nice reader.  Far better than the HDX.  The iPad came in last because while screen res is fine, you cannot get a decent sepia from it.  Sepia is nearly white.  Oddly. the iPad supports that cool page turn animation while the Android and WP and even the Kindle do not.As for watching movies, I think I have to give the nod to the iPad.  Sound is good on the iPad - nearly as good as the HDX.  Make no mistake, the HDX sounds great.  I hate to be repetitive, but that damn screen really sucks.  If you read the other reviews, it gets hammered for that constantly and Amazon pawns off some lame excuse about how their great display technology is so wonderful you should be happy to pay the price of that violet glow.  Well, the display is nice in the center.  But it's no better than the N7.  So, sound and display for movies goes to iPad, plus you can download your movies to the iPad just like the HDX.  You cannot, unfortunately, watch videos on Android.  Why Amazon doesn't allow this is stupid and beyond me.  You cannot BUY movies from iPad, but that is the only disadvantage there.As for use as a tablet - the HDX is very clearly focused on use as entertainment, centered on Amazon.  There is little there that is free, unlike Android or iPad.  What is available is available ONLY through Amazon.  You cannot use Google Play to fetch apps.As far as performance goes, no quibbles.  The HDX screams.  It's very fast and smooth.  But then so are the other tabs, with the N7 being slightly slower.So, the summary.  If you were able to buy titles using the iPad, I'd say forget the HDX.  Get an iPad.  It's a far better general purpose tab than the HDX, and every bit as good as the HDX for movies and reading.  If you could WATCH movies on the N7, I'd say get that.  It has the best reading display of the three, and not being locked in to Amazon is a huge benefit.  If all you care about is consuming Amazon content and that purple hell-glow is OK with you, then get the HDX.  It's the smallest of the devices, with a slightly larger screen than the N7 (not as big as the iPad though) with good sound.  If Amazon ever gets it's head out of the sand, stops trying to convince everyone that the screen is actually OK, really it is, and FIXES IT, I will buy it again just for reading and movies.

Amazon generally has been painless in this matter, but I was surprised at the insistence of the account representative to send me a replacement.

I already own an iPad 3, an iPhone, and a MacBook Pro. So it only made sense that I come full circle and buy the mini when I needed a smaller more portable tablet. However, while shopping around, the Kindle Fire HDX won me over.I normally breakdown the good, bad, and the ugly of the products I review. But there's really nothing bad nor ugly about the Kindle Fire HDX. So I've settled for good and not so good...GOOD~ It's affordable. I purchased this using my Amazon store card and received $50 off from their promotion. So for $179, it's $220 cheaper than its rival, the iPad Mini w/ Retina display.~ The images are clear and the colors are vivid. My husband even thinks the screen quality is better than the iPad.~ It's incredibly light. When I unboxed it, I immediately lost myself in a book for a good 3 hours. And there was no hand strain from holding the Kindle up to read for that long.~ I can buy books from Amazon directly from the books section. With the iPad, I had to go Safari, log in to Amazon, buy the book, log back out, then go back to the Kindle app before I can read the book I want.~ I finally get to take advantage of my (1) free book a month for being a Prime member.~ The silk browser is fast and the browsing experience is noticeably smooth.~ I can switch between reading and listening to the book's narration without exiting the books section.~ A ton of apps to choose from. Having used the iOS platform for so long, I was a tad concern that there won't be enough apps for the Kindle. But I was wrong.~ Very user-friendly and easy-to-navigate. If my 3-year old can navigate through the HDX with ease, then so can you.~ Decent battery life. My kids and I put the HDX through the paces when I first unboxed it. And after watching a ton of YouTube videos, reading half a book, browsing through several web pages, and listening to an audiobook, the HDX stayed alive for a good 10 hours.~ MAYDAY BUTTON! This sealed the deal for me. A 24-hour customer support rep directly on your Kindle HDX with just a touch of a button. I mean c'mon, this feature blows Siri completely out of the water.NOT SO GOOD:~ The speakers are not as loud as I'm used to. In some cases it even sounded a bit muffled. But when using headphones, the sound is loud and clear.~ The front camera's quality is not so good. It's grainy. But since I won't be using this for video chats or taking pictures, it's not a big deal.~ The app store is not secure. While my daughter was using the HDX, I got an email thanking me for an app I purchased. Good thing she chose a free app. I have yet to figure out if I can set a password every time someone tries to purchase an app. This feature is available on the iPad, not sure if it too is available on the HDX.~ In the first 48 hours that I had the HDX, my wireless connection would automatically disconnect when the HDX is not in use. So every time I tried to use it I had to log back in to the network and establish a connection. After a few times of doing this I finally got tired and hit the Mayday Button. The Amazon rep was so patient and helpful. We finally fixed the issue, I only needed to modify my router's proxy settings.VERDICT:~ BUY IT!

A few other perks like really great support and cameras front and back. Gadget junkie that I am, I resisted until December, but my Fire was slowing down. Probably from all the stuff I was doing on it. Mind you, it never stopped working but it didn't work quite as well as it had. When Amazon dropped the price by $50 before Christmas, I bought the HDX. It came with 6-month financing at 0% interest. Nice.The Amazon Kindle Fire HDX has a new, improved interface for email and the calendar is better too. I know the audio and video were technically better, but they didn't seem different to me; the audio and video on the Fire HD are super and from super to more super? Nothing to notice. I loved my Kindle Fire HD and figured I would love the new one even more. And so I did. For a day. Maybe two. The battery drained in a phenomenally short time. At one point, I was on the phone with Kindle support complaining about the battery -- and it was dropping at about 1% every two or three minutes. In about 40 minutes, it dropped more than 50%. I plugged it in before it went flat. It also drained while it was not in use -- sleeping -- at approximately 5% per hour. Reading -- not audio or video -- drained it at 15% per hour. As the battery hit less than 20%, it became unresponsive. Customer support suggested I let it drain all the way and recharge it. Which I did.Same story. It seems you can't turn off any of the apps once you turn them on except by forcing a stop. Which slows (but doesn't stop) the draining while the device sleeps, but not when you are using it. Then it just chews through the battery at warp speed.Back at customer service, she said I should send it back and try a different one, there must be something wrong with the unit. I wasn't so sure about it. I had a funny itchy feeling in my brain that the problem was NOT my unit, but a design issue. I'd been reading reviews. Too many people were complaining of battery problems. I had noticed the reviews before I bought but refused to believe Amazon would knowingly market a product not suitable for its intended purpose. If a portable device -- a 7\u2033 tablet -- doesn't have a good battery life, it's useless.The Fire HD didn't have weeks of battery life, as does a plain Kindle, but it had a solid 12 hours. Twelve hours of actual use. On the Fire HDX, you'd be lucky to get 4 hours. Nonetheless, after being assured if the replacement was unsatisfactory, I could return it, I agreed. A couple of days later, the new HDX arrived.The second HDX was worse than the first. After little more than a week, I called Amazon and said \"That's it, I'm done.\" In the meantime, in a fit of totally unwarranted optimism, I had given my Fire HD to my daughter-in-law and I couldn't bring myself to ask for it back. I wouldn't have gotten it anyhow because she REALLY likes it. So there I was without a Kindle. I could use my husband's temporarily, but not long-term because he reads too.I bought the Paperwhite -- the model with WiFi, not 3G. It arrived yesterday. I set it up late in the afternoon. It went live as soon as I plugged it in. It immediately  - at blinding speed -- connected, displaying all my books and documents sorted into the categories I'd created on my original Kindle. The Paperwhite reminded me why I fell in love with Kindles. It's a great reader. It has a few little bells (no whistles). It's light, small, easy-to-use. It has some similar design elements as the Fire HD -- a touch screen, virtual keyboard and its own light -- but retains many things I loved about the older Kindles, mainly that it is a wonderful device on which to read a book.Paperwhite is a dedicated reader, not a tablet. Flat, non-reflective surface -- very easy on the eyes. Adjustable fonts and lighting that won't wake your spouse or make you go blind. It weighs almost nothing, even with a cover. You can get inexpensive covers for it. Mine (from Fintie) cost $10. There were cheaper ones, but I liked this design and I've owned Fintie covers and knew the quality is good. I settled in to read last night and for the first time in a long time, could focus on the book. The Fire HD was a great little tablet, but it was forever teasing me away from reading to play a game, hear a tune, or watch a movie -- things I can easily do on my laptop.Perhaps this is what I should have gotten in the first place. Regardless, I cannot recommend the new Kindle Fire HDX. The battery is inadequate to the tablet. I'm really sorry to have to say this. Unless you plan to use it plugged in, charge it after every use ... nope. Doesn't live up to its PR or its predecessor.Sorry, Amazon.

If you're a Prime member, this is the best tablet to get the most out of Prime.I have an iPad mini and the first gen Nexus 7 already and used several older tablets (iPad 1, Acer Iconnia, Dell....) and it's amazing how much faster each new generation of devices performs. This HDX has a very clear, sharp screen. I haven't seen the new iPad mini with retina but I can't justify spending almost twice as much for it.So far, here are the two negatives about the tablet:1. Mine was shipped with a usb cable and power adapter. However, when I plugged it in using the supplied cable and adapter my tablet displayed a message about using a low powered power supply. It charges very slowly. Every other tablet I've owned came with a 2amp adapter for optimized charging. Why did Amazon bother to include a 1amp charger?2. Not all Prime videos are downloadable. This was the big reason I finally bought a Fire and I was disappointed to find that many titles, especially the more popular  titles, were not available for download.If you are planning to download multiple Prime videos, I suggest upgrading to a 32 GB or bigger. I downloaded one movies at full HD size and it took almost 8 GB.

I read previous reviews that stated there is a purple border around the edges of the book your reading.

Responsive. Runs games, or video streaming, HD TV streaming - with no lags.**DesignThat hardly depends on personal taste. Myself I like it. Easy to hold even with one hand. Not slippy. Light. Good thing is that Power and Audio buttons are well situated. If you hold HDX and watch something, or listening music while reading and wish to adjust volume - easy to find buttons as your fingers are exactly there.**Screen/Reading experienceIt is marvelous for reading. I do have Kindle reader as well and mostly read on it, but sometimes have to use Kindle Fire - for EPUBS f/e and I should say KF HDX screen is amazing step ahead. Of course, for reading not as good as EInk screens, but really better than reading on smartphone  or IPad Mini or Notebook. Do not have Nexus, thus can say nothing about. Can't compare here.Only bad thing with this screen is that it's glossy. Terribly glossy. If you love dark backgrounds and pick that option in apps, or if you read and prefer white letters/black background - forget about. You would see yourself in the screen like in a mirror. But for white (or any light) background/black letter thing - as I have said above reading experience is superb!Of course for movies and games HDX screen is superb as well. Rich and bright,  well calibrated.  Vivid colors. No complains here.I do have some applications for note-taking (handwriting) like 7Notes and HDX is good for that. With a stylus you can take notes or draw something - would not say that's exactly like if you have a pen and paper but quite close.**AudioSpeakers are well situated so you never hold it with your hand. And the audio is good - loud and clear. I do also have bluetooth speakers but no real need to use them. Well, maybe somewhere in a noisy environment.Back, where speakers are located has an angle and that's smart - if you lay HDX on table, speakers are not covered and audio is good.**BatteryHolds about 10-11 hours (Amazon says 11). But when you read, it automatically picks energysave regime, well done! Nice option really and very useful.Charging takes about 6 hours. Bit less.But HDX charger output is 1A, when HDX can be charged at 1.8A - thus, better to use other charger it would be fast. F/e 1st Gen KF charger output is exactly 1.8A.**Web browsingWith double antenna it finds Wi-Fi easily and holds it well.Silk browser is getting better. Works well, quick enough but still below Chrome. Of course Silk is the only browser on Amazon appstore, but sideloading is possible. :)Streaming is smooth. You can watch online TV from some other web-servers, of course watch Youtube, Dailymotion... No lags. If you have access to some HD TV online broadcast services - HDX is good for that as well. Buffering is very quick and after it goes like a charm. HDX great hardware gives you all benefits here.**HDX Keyboard/FontsYou can read books, surf web in any (or almost any? - don't want to make a mistake) language and you can type as well as HDX new keyboard gives an option to download lots of additional languages. And keyboard supports path-tracing like Swype. Works really well. If you love Swype keyboard, HDX one is close to that standard.**EcosystemDepends you are a long-time Amazon customer or new here. Are you a Prime member or not. Myself I am with Amazon for several years now. Buy from e-shop, also reading on Kindle (reader), later when they release KF tablet I got it... thus, HDX integration with Amazon services is an important thing for me. You access all your books. All your documents you store with Amazon. Cloud Drive is integrated. Videos, music streaming. You can now download Prime videos as well.Needless to say, that buying from Amazon e-shop or siblings like Zappos or MyHabit is easy and nice.As for apps - of course Amazon Appstore is way behind it's e-shop. You may not find lots of applications you wish to have. Hope Amazon would work here and call more developers. But again - don't forget, you can find an application somewhere else and sideload to HDX. Of course - that's not an ideal, but still a solution sometimes.And MayDay. 24/7 Online support. Have not used it yet. :) But that may be helpful when you need.**Cons/Things you should consider, while orderingTraditionally: No Google Play (but some Google apps like Calendar, Music or Gmail can be sideloaded and work - pls., see comments for details). But you know, what you buy.No rare camera but for me that was not crucial while making a decision as I do not really gonna to use it having smartphone with better camera.As for blue light around screen edges - lots of people do complain. For my eyes that's barely noticeable and not irritating while reading or browsing.If you refer to \"We want you to know...\" topic on HDX page, Amazon says, that \"All displays have some level of light emission around the edges... Most LCD displays use white LEDs. To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7\" at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20% improvement in power efficiency.\"Thus, if you buy HDX, you have to live with blue glow. Future software updates would leave that intact I guess.Fire OS is almost no Android OS. Hard to feel Android here. And native launcher is much different from any other Android launcher. If HDX is not your first KF - than you know it, but if HDX is your first tablet form Amazon, you may feel lost from the beginning.  I felt this way when I received my 1st Gen. KF... finally I ended installing an alternative launcher. Sorry, Amazon. :)But I should say, that for HDX Amazon made some nice changes - f/e option to see apps. in greed view. That's nice.**Special offersYou see Ad ONLY on lock screen, as soon you slide to unlock - ad banner disappears. Not annoying at all IMHO.In conclusion - great hardware, well build and if you are with Amazon ecosystem and do not need Google Play etc. - this is an extremely nice tablet.___Accessories:**CaseJust got Slimline Case from Poetic (which is on sale right now on Amazon). Fits HDX well. Awakes tablet when opened, like Origami case does. Very good one.**OTG/BluetoothNo surprise, but in case you wonder - no flash drive supported via OTG but I tried to connect HDX and my smartphone via bluetooth and it works.", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire HDX 7\", HDX Display, Wi-Fi, 32 GB - Includes Special Offers", "Author": "Bruno F.

The screen is beautiful. It has 323 pixels per inch as opposed to 216 for the HD. Apparently 107 pixels per inch is enough to bring a device from high definition into extreme high definition.Whatever the numbers really mean doesn't mean a whole lot to most people. This screen is dazzling and it will not disappoint you.StorageA 16 gig HDD isn't too terrible for something that costs $229. The main issue here is that if you intend to use the feature allowing you to store 1080p movies then those 16 gigabytes will fill up rather quickly. It is also apparent that the operating system and support software will also take up a portion of that 16 gigabytes. As with nearly all devices of this type one can assume that it is likely that you will never be able to increase the size of this hard drive.Form FactorKindle Fires have always been build like a tank. They were able to take a beating and are more difficult to crack than other screen-based items. Unfortunately, this comes with the price that the Kindle Fire was rather bulky and clunky. This time around we get a nice slim device that also seems durable. It is comfortable to hold in your hand without feeling cheap. The width went from 0.9 inches to 0.6 inches (33% thinner!) and the weight went from .86 pounds to .66 pounds.New Operating systemRecently, the Kindle Fire operating system has started to become a bit more difficult to use. Things seems to be a little bit less user friendly, though it did have a lot more features. I got to see an older generation in my family struggle when the OS got an upgrade for the Kindle Fire HD.The New Operating System is called Mojito and it is based on androids JellyBean. This feels more iterative than a revamp but some things about it definitely work. You still have the carousel with Mojito, but you can view more apps at once which definitely makes this feature more usable. Silk now feels like something I might actually want to use. I feel that this has has the biggest upgrade with the new operating system. The Keyboard here feels much smoother and pages definitely seem to have loaded faster (though i guess i should thank the increased specs for that one). This is also helped along by the fact that the touch screen is far more accurate. I can't be certain of who to thank but this is definitely a smoother, more pleasurable experience.New FeaturesAs we know there are many things to like about amazons Kindle. People can go back and forth comparing the size, quality, and price of this item to that of an iPad. Here are a few argument winners that will help to sway people into the Amazon ecosystem.Prime Viewing...now watch Prime without internetYou will now be able to download amazon prime content directly to the hard drive of your Kindle. This means you can enjoy a long car trip or a plane ride without using 3G service. This is a great upgrade and truly has this item stand apart.X-RAY just got better (sorta)Now with X-RAY you can bring up imdb.com information on people that have just come into the screen. This is partly and old feature but it will become new again with trivia. This is just the trivia that is already provided on the imdb.com website, but it is a fun addition. There are also instances where you can follow certain lyrics line by line. At the time of the review I have yet to try out this feature.The idea of adding more to X-RAY is nice. Anything that makes watching a movie more immerse is a good thing. Unfortunately, this kinda feels like something that you will forget about very quickly. Though, there is a push for this kind of content nowadays (SmartGlass) so maybe it could become something we all naturally all use, time will tell i supposeMaydayTo me, this is the thing that really drew my attention.  This is definitely something that is meant to be used by my parents but it gives a warm to the product. A savy electronics user may never need to use Mayday in order to find out where the home button is but it would be fantastic if this type of feature is forever integrated into devices by other companies. Hopefully, this free service will be a game-changer for customer service.Why Only Four Stars? (small drawbacks)The new Kindle Fire HDX is a fantastic piece of hardware. It is light, beautiful, and fast. Unfortunately, this device feels as locked down as previous Kindle Fire models.The the entire Kindle Fire line boasts that it is compatible with 80,000 apps. This number looks really high but there are nearly 10x as many apps on the android store that are not compatible with the Kindle Fire. Kindle items are Android devices of sorts, why can't they run every app available?In addition to this there still does not seem to be any way to create your own home screen wallpaper. I have seen with previous devices that even with the ads turned off you still cannot choose your own home screen. The images they have provided are stunning, yet there is no customization. There should at least be a way to set your home screen to reflect the image of the book you have most recently read.Holding the device is wonderful, it is light and the face of the device is beautiful. The back has a rubber touch to it and the side has a nice angle to it. The power button and the volume rocker are on this angled surface which is nice, but it's not entirely impossible to feel a bit uncomfortable at first. One thing that is curious to me is that the speakers have been moved to the back. They have a nicer speaker set this time around but it seems unusual to me to be projecting that backward. In addition to this is seems possible to me that some people might naturally want to hold the device with their fingers covering these speaker holes. Clearly, these are minor issues that may not amount to much once you get accustomed to it.If you have come to this page looking for a way to figure out if you should get the 7\" or the 8.9\" I have one insight for you. I have never held the 8.9\" but one instant difference is that the larger device has a rear facing camera. This wouldn't be a deal-breaker for me but i thought it might be important to note this.These few issues are very petty and, in the long run, they are insignificant. I am just shocked that such a fantastic device has such unusual restrictions. I cannot imagine that this would ruin the device for any buyer, but I felt it would only be fair to make you aware.This device is beautiful and deserves a spot in your home if you are looking for an upgrade. I love the look and feel of this device, I will just be sitting here hoping that the next time around we get a stock android device, though maybe I should just be happy that this thing will keep a huge smile on my face for a very long time.", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire HDX 7\" 64GB and Prime downloads \"SPOILER\"", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Usagi Driver\"", "ReviewID": "R3TQF9CKUT20N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The HDX is magnificent, just read all the raves.

Allemann", "ReviewID": "R13RFVFJ44AQL8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, I am a long time Apple Fan. I own a Mac Desktop, an iPad and an iPhone. I like to use my phone strictly for phone-related uses--making calls, using the map while traveling---that sort of thing. It is just too small for watching movies, playing games and such. But I wanted a small 4G LTE tablet of some sort that was light and would easily slip inside my purse. I wanted one that I could take with me when I traveled out of town, made road trips with my hubby, or when I'm killing time waiting for my son at his music lessons. My iPad is full-size and connected to a keyboard case, so I didn't want to keep lugging that around. So, since I am an Amazon Prime member, and after much thought and research, I finally decided on the Kindle Fire HDX 7\".At first I was concerned that I might not like it. One thing I don't care for as an Apple user is how restricted their apps are and how geared they are toward all things Apple. I was afraid that I might be repeating myself by buying a Kindle---that this tablet might be locked up in all things Amazon with no access to Google apps, youTube, Gmail, Chrome, or other apps that might not be available in the Amazon app store. However, I've found that the Kindle Fire is not locked up after all. I learned that even though there are some really great apps in the Amazon store, not everything is there that I might like or want. Yet, it was very easy to install a third party app called 1MobileMarket, and with that I have been able to side-load apps that I can't find in the Amazon app store. One app I was abler to download for example is Chrome, which of course is a Google app. It works great! I was able to sign in on Chrome with my Google account and watch all the youTube playlists and favorites that I had accumulated in my Google youTube account. I was also able to earmark Google as my search engine of choice on the Silk browser. In the Kindle email app, I was able to incorporate both my Hotmail and my Gmail accounts, and it handles both of them seamlessly. While I'm on the subject of side loading, another app that you might want to download right off the bat is the free app ES File Explorer. It's a full-featured file and app manager which is similar to Finder on a Mac or Windows Explorer on a PC. It's been really valuable in helping me find and organize apps and games, etc. after I've side-loaded them to my kindle. I highly recommend this app before you get started with side loading.Now on to my music collection. I have a ton of songs that I've already placed in my iTunes account and I didn't want to have to buy them again in order to listen to them on my Kindle. So by using the (free) Amazon Cloud Player and the (free) Amazon Music Importer, I was able to upload all the music that I had put in my iTunes account to the Amazon Cloud. The next time I turned on my Kindle Fire HDX, then went to Music, there were all my songs right there for me to listen to and/or download to my Kindle. I then found a really great feature within the Music app. It is called x-ray. I found it by accidentally pressing it as I was listening to a Diana Krall song. While I was listening to the song, and when I pressed the x-ray icon, up on the screen came the lyrics to the song, following along with Ms. Krall as she sang (similar to karaoke words streaming on the screen). When the next song came on, the lyrics to that song came up on the screen. Cool! The sound is amazingly strong for such a small tablet! As is the video display. And speaking of videos, I have several instant videos that I've purchased on Amazon, and they display and sound beautifully on the Kindle Fire HDX! I also have several videos on my Mac computer, and by using the free app Android File Transfer which I had downloaded onto my Mac, I was able to connect my Kindle to my Mac with the USB cord, and simply upload those videos to the Kindle library storage.Day by day I'm learning more and more about my Kindle and how fun and easy it is to use. But on the second day after I had bought it, I ran into a problem while trying to get into the app store. I couldn't figure out how what to do, because I couldn't get the App store to open. I just kept getting a black screen. So I pulled down the Kindle menu from the top, found and pressed the Mayday feature and within a matter of seconds, a young man with headphones on popped up on the screen and asked in a friendly voice, \"Hello! How may I help you?\" I told him the problem, and then watched my screen in amazement as he opened the necessary screen, forced closed an app, and then got me into the app store. Within moments he fixed the problem right before my eyes. So impressive! (By the way, although you can see them, they can't see you---in case you're wondering)One problem that some have mentioned, is the blue/purple haze around the edges of the screen when one is reading an ebook on this Kindle. Yes, I guess it is there, now that I looked for it. But I really don't find it to be a distraction, because it is very slight. However, you have three different page color settings to choose from that might help if this really bothers you. You can choose to have your book pages be white with black letters, sepia pages with brownish-black lettering, or black pages with white letters. Since I prefer the black pages/white letters setting (as I mostly read at night), the faint purple haze around the edges of the book pages aren't an issue for me because it simply doesn't show at all under the black color. Speaking of the eBooks section, many (most?) of the books have a feature on them called Text to Speech. While reading a book, you simply tap on the Play icon, and the book becomes an audio book, and you can listen as the book is read to you while you go about doing other things.So to summarize, I am a long time faithful Apple user, but I have to say that I am really liking my new Kindle Fire HDX. Don't let the negative reviews keep you from trying this little amazing tablet out for yourself. For all the \"problems\" that I've seen mentioned here and there, there's none that are really an issue (in my humble opinion) as you get to know your Kindle Fire. I can honestly say that the more I learn about this little tablet and all the wonderful things it can do, the happier I am that I took the plunge and bought it!", "Date": "April 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "My new favorite toy", "Author": "asortafairytale", "ReviewID": "R3701V3BUK0UM0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this about a month ago and wanted to give myself some time to play around with it before writing this review.Let me just say, I'm really enjoying it. It's the first tablet I've ever owned, so I can't compare it to anything else, but I am really enjoying this little toy. I've downloaded and listened to a couple of audio books while driving to and from work. I'm addicted to a few game apps that are eating up WAY more time than they should, but that's what they're for, right? I also have the Weather Channel app that I check each morning before I get ready for work.One of my absolute favorite features is the quality of the screen. I have the Netflix and Hulu apps and the screen is so freaking amazing. So crisp and clear. Honestly, it's better than the screen on my laptop. I still use my laptop for laptopy things - creating Word and Excel documents, or going online if I need to have multiple browser windows or tabs open/do multiple things at once. But if I just want to sit and watch a video, I prefer this Kindle over my laptop.I've also read a couple of books on it. Not my favorite, to be honest. I'm not a huge fan of reading on a backlit screen. I have a Kindle Keyboard that I much prefer reading on.

Something that looked nice, didn't cost too much, and had some good reviews. I had no idea this sleek,little, black tablet would become one of my favorite electronic items in the house.I had used a relative's older Kindle HD off and on, so thought I had an idea about speed and what to expect.  Nope, wrong.  The new 2.2GHz Quad-core Snapdragon processor is blazing fast.  Tapping on an app, and it opening, is near instant, HD movies play seamlessly with stutter and pixelation being an extreme rarity. Web pages load quickly, and the touch-screen is responsive, yet not so sensitive you will accidentally open an app by brushing against it's icon.The button placement and size, to me, are ideal.  With the older Kindle, it was easy to think you are pressing volume, but would be pressing on/off.  Not to mention they were tiny. The power button and the volume buttons are on opposite sides on the HDX. Mine is in a case, and neither button has accidentally been depressed.If you are looking for a gorgeous screen with vivid detail and color, the Kindle HDX is impressive.  The 1920x1200 display handles HD content with ease, ebooks are crisp and clear; it really is stunning. Additionally, the black level rendering is superb for such a small unit. Brightness can be set manually or you can let the Kindle adjust it automatically based on lighting conditions.Located on the back are two speakers and there is also a mini-jack in case you want to use headphones.  For as thin as the HDX is, the sound quality is good.  While the speakers cannot compare to a Home Theater, they reproduce sound clearly and with little to no distortion, even at maximum volume.Battery life has been more than adequate for my needs, yet I have noticed that how long it lasts can vary depending on usage.  For example, I started off with the battery at 100% and streamed movies for four hours straight; it was at 70% at the end.  Conversely, I played a popular game on it for 30 minutes, and the battery went from 100% to 82%.  Every time I play it, I know to expect a 10% draw in about 15 minutes.  Also, any app that uses a lot of memory or constantly runs in the background can affect battery life.  A Memory Manager can help turn off apps in the background and prolong the battery.My normal usage consists of heavy email, medium amounts of web surfing, lots of reading, and a few hours of streaming, mirrored to the TV.  Adding it all together probably equals between 3-6 hours per day.  The lowest the level has been was 33%, and that was after using all day and forgetting to plug in at night, so it stayed in sleep mode until the next day.Below I will address some concerns that seem to be common:1.  Dropped or poor WiFi Signal-- I have had this happen only three times in three months of ownership.  Once, was due to the router needing to be \"flushed.\" The second time, I cleared the cache in the Kindle, and the third time I have no explanation, but a simple rebooting of the HDX fixed the issue.2. Blue glow around the edges-- If I had not read about this, I would never have noticed it.  The only time it is visible is on an all white background, such as an ebook.  However, to me it is very faint and neglible unless you are focusing solely on the edges.  It is due to the edge lighting using the blue LED's and using the auto-brightness or manual adjustments should minimize impact.3. Screen Flicker-- This does happen on occasion, yet only with certain memory and color-intensive apps.  Every time it has self-corrected within a short period, and have never experienced it when streaming a video or movie.4. Ads-- I did not pay extra for no ads, but do not see them as a problem.  They only appear on the lock screen and do not interfere with performance.  Additionally, you can view them all on one page and sometimes a special buy will show.  If you absolutely do not want ads, the payable option exists.5. Laggy/Slow performance-- As with any computer device, the cache can become full and should be cleaned regularly.  Anytime my Kindle HDX seemed slow, a simple cleaning remedied the issue.  One note--certain apps can affect performance and I recommend checking after installing various apps to see if they hinder the device. The cleaner I use is Clean Master and it also acts as a memory manager.6. No Google Play--It is true that you cannot download from Google Play, however, there are other reputable android sites that you can use.  Youtube and the Web have plenty of resources to help.  You will need a File Manager, which can be obtained in the Kindle Store for free.  I use File Manager Free along with 1MobileMarket for any android apps not available in the Kindle Store yet.7. No Youtube-- I use Youtube all of the time on my HDX, whether through Silk or through the app on my Bluray Player.Some other Features and Benefits:1. I have three email accounts synced with my Kindle HDX.  It makes it very easy and convenient to turn it on and have instant access to all of them at once.2. For me, it is preferable to not use the carousel.  I appreciate that I can just swipe upwards and have all the apps I put on my home page arranged cleanly just like desktop icons.  Additionally, by holding an app and dragging it to another you can create \"folders\" to customize the appearance.  For example, have all your games in one  folder icon, all of your productivity apps in another, and so on.3. My Kindle HDX can control two cable boxes, my bluray player, my AV Receiver, act as an independent cable box, stream movies with Amazon Prime and Cable On-Demand.  Once the Home Theater is on, all I need is the Kindle to control all of it.4. Using the Netgear PTV3000, an app, and the Kindle HDX has eliminated the need for me to have a cable box for each TV.5. As time goes on, I keep finding more uses for the HDX.  It is amazing how much this small tablet can do at a fraction of the cost of others.6. It is an incredible e-book reader and library.  I love how convenient it is to have so many books in one place and be able to take them wherever I go.The Kindle HDX has become the most-used computer in the house. It does everything I initially wanted and much more and is still working great after three months. If you are looking for an incredible value in a tablet, then I definitely recommend it.

I have looked at them for a long time and wanted one when the first `Fire' came out but just kept putting it off.  When I finally decided to take the plunge and get one I had heard there was a new updated one about to be released and waited for the newest version.I've had it now for a week. It's a great little tablet at a great price. It is slim, light weight and looks great!  The screen is beautiful, great picture quality and the processor is very fast.  Mine was almost fully charged when I received it, so I basically just had to pull it out of the box turn it on and `GO'.  It was already registered through Amazon. It seemed to do a quick little update and all was set.  Plus it is great it came with a quick charger adaptor, as it seemed all the previous versions never did.At the moment I mainly will use it for reading books, playing some games and occasional internet use. I like all the other options of things you can do with it, even if I don't think I need it at the moment.  At this point I am not sure if I will use it for streaming movies as it sounds many like to do. It's nice to have the option to do it. Maybe in time I will look at doing that and give up most of the movie channels I pay for on my cable tv.Some are complaining about a purple haze border around edge of screen.  I can see that now, but to be honest, I had to go looking for it after I read it in the reviews.  It is not very noticeable to me.  I just don't see it as a big deal and  I wouldn't consider this such a major flaw to give it a negative review or send it back.  It is a faint, and I mean faint, haze.

Will be returning the tablet to try the Nexus 7 or just go and buy a Mini 2/Air.I'll keep it short and easy to read and list the pros and cons as bullet points (I was hesitating between a 2 or 3 but I think Amazon is on the right track so 3 stars):Pros:1- Very clear and beautiful 1920X1200 resolution screen (A bit higher resolution than 1080p which is 1920X1080). Even better than your HDTV since it's this high of resolution on a smaller size (higher PPI)2- Excellent speaker volume and location. Doesn't get blocked when using the hdx in landscape mode (the iPad and Nexus 7 have the speaker placement issue)3- Mayday is actually very useful for someone that isn't tech savy. I was able to get connected every time I tested it within 10-15seconds. I would assume the wait will be longer during holiday season.Cons:1- The first and biggest issue for this and any tablet is APP selection. This one is missing many of the latest and greatest apps that are on the Apple App store and Google Play (including Time Warner App, some banking apps, big mobile games)etc...The Amazon app store is currently estimated at 75000 apps while both the Apple and Google App stores are each over 1 million apps and have many dedicated specifically to the tablet (specially the Apple App Store)2- Buttons placement of On/Off button and volume Up/Down are horrible and size is way too small for my normal sized hands.3- Although it is smoother than the last Samsung Tab 2 I've used, the interface still feels a bit clunky at times. It's not butter smooth like the IOS on the iPad (believe me, even my iPad 1 was smoother than this)4- Apps crashed too frequently, even when going in the prebuilt Shopping and App store apps5- Needs better quality control. I understand this is probably the first batch of the tablets and usually every first few batch of a gadget have some issues but I really think better quality control would alleviate most if not all issues. My HDX has some screen flashing as if the backlight is getting adjusted up and down consistently. Also, I have a dead pixel that is quite noticeable in the middle right side of the screen.", "Date": "November 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great tablet for the right demographic", "Author": "Deedubau", "ReviewID": "R2ZIR7TT7M487E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had this tablet and cover for about a week and I think it's a great device. The design, the weight, the very easy and straightforward UI, and the reading experience. When you pick up the device for the first time  it feels really solid and not too heavy like the Kindle fire HD did. The software and user interface is really smooth and doesn't stutter. Unlike android tablets I didn't feel overwhelmed at all and it's just extremely easy to grasp and navigate. Without the official cover, I found the back buttons confusing to use, and even then it wasn't much better because it was annoying to reach behind the flap and press on the button I needed every time. Here are my other thoughts on this device:ReadingThe reading experience is really great, but just keep in mind that the borders of the screen have a light blue hue to it, which is apparently normal and didn't annoy me. Super crisp text, different fonts, different highlighted colors and the text to speech voice along with buying audiobooks to read along is great. As a matter of fact, I put the device to sleep and had it read me a number of books a few times. The text to speech feels really natural and I would imagine this being a selling point for some since the e-ink readers no longer provide this feature. The only issue I have right now is that it doesn't provide collections like the iOS app does, but from what I understand it's coming in a future update.Video/audioThe videos look and sound fantastic, and the stereo speakers are good enough to the point where I don't even need to use my Jambox blueooth speaker like I did for my iPads. Netflix, Amazon Prime videos, Hulu and even the CW app (I'm addicted to this show called the The Tomorrow People) are all there. Now, if you're a youtube fan DO NOT expect a good experience for this because it's currently only done on the mobile web. The pictures on the Kindle Fire HDX page show an integrated app, so that's either incorrect or I'm guessing it's not complete yet. The mobile web is not a great experience because you can't easily view your favorites and it's just not as good as using a native app. And sideloading (which I'll talk more about later) the app doesn't let you log into youtube because the logon needs to work with a unmodified Android UI device.Web BrowsingIt's very fast and smooth, but i t only lets you have about 5 tabs at once. This is the first Amazon Silk browser that's given me a good experience to the point where I didn't think I needed to sideload a faster browser. I like how you can default it to pick to load either a full webpage or mobile site. This is great for casual browsing but I'm a big tab and web surfer so I really would've preferred using chrome and all my saved bookmarks there.AppsIf you don't have any specific app you need in mind then the selection is pretty good. It has a lot of the major ones out there but some of the ones missing in the amazon app store like dropbox and instagram aren't there. You can however sideload them :) The games run super smooth on this device thanks to the state of the art Snapdragon 800 processor but don't expect any big android game launches to appear on this device right away. The last big one is Dead Trigger 2 which still hasn't appeared in the amazon app store yet.Battery lifeLike my previous generation Kindle Fires, not good at all in my experience. It charges a lot faster than the older generations, but I average about maybe 5ish hours for this device, and that's with either no or occasional video. I never had this issue with my iPads, but I always feel like I'm charging the Kindle Fires more than I'm using them.Final thoughts and opinionsNotice how I mentioned sideload a few times in this review. I honestly think if you want to take full advantage of what the tablet offers (and tinker around with it), then this might not be for you. It's designed (and designed to make money off of) for people who only stick to the amazon ecosystem and do a fair amount of reading. As much as I enjoyed using the device, I realized that the Nexus  7 would be a better fit for my needs. I can do without the text to speech and settle for a 3rd rate Kindle reading experience (it's much better on iOS) where I can't change the text, do X-ray or view popular highlights. I do have a Paperwhite so I'm fine without having this on my tablet. I guess the more I used my HDX, the less I was interesting in reading because it was able to do so much more than that. I returned my HDX today for the Nexus 7 and even though it's a bit more underpowered, I'm happy with owning an Android tablet that gives me full access to android apps via the play store. For everyone else, this is a great purchase anyone who doesn't mind the amazon ecosystem and loves shopping on amazon while taking advantage of their prime membership.

I'm posting this as 4-stars, minus one star for reasons I'll explain below. Some of my points will be comparing it to the original Fire.First up, it is noticeably lighter than the original Fire, and the beveled edges make it a bit easier to hold. There is a bizarrely angled port for the power charger, in that it does not sit flush with the Fire, and you kinda have to keep this in mind when plugging it in. I am mildly concerned that the power cable will experience stress, especially in a situation when I am using it while charging it. It just seems like a weird thing.Setting it up was pretty easy, just a few steps, log in to your Amazon account, and it automatically populates the carousel with my recently read books, in the proper order. I used the Silk browser for a while, and it is very nice; it is a full blown browser, not the \"mobile\" browser that I've seen on various Android devices. Pinch-n-zoom, slide-n-scroll, all the navigation people are probably already familiar with. If not, it doesn't take long to get used to it.I did look at some prior reviews just now, and see a lot of people mention the \"purple haze\", and unfortunately for me, now that I've read about it, I see the same effect on my HDX. It is mostly apparent in certain lighting situations, such as the reading books, when the screen is mostly white. I watched several hours of anime and did not notice anything at the time. It does not seem to be apparent on the home screen or a few other places, which makes me wonder if this is just a possible software fix.Battery life seems pretty good. When I first got it out of the box, it was at 60% charge, and it did not take very long to top it off. I did not time anything, so I can only offer subjective impressions. I watched at least 18 25-minute videos before I felt the battery was depleted enough to need a recharge, but it was not less than 25%, and I could have squeaked more non-video usage out of it.Speaking of video, this new HDX has the option to download Prime videos. I mean, you can watch them for free via Prime, but to actually download them? That's a new thing on me. I ended up downloading 14 episodes, one right after the other. Those videos take up a bit under 2gb of memory. Seems pretty good.Edit: I forgot to mention that the speakers are very nice compared to the original Fire. While using the first-gen Fire to watch videos, one of the first things I felt I needed was a set of external speakers. Once you start adding external accessories to a supposedly portable device, well, you kinda lose something in that process. The HDX speakers are very nice, crisp and loud enough that I don't feel the need for external speakers.The video app is very fickle for me. I selected the series I wanted to watch, which was an anime with 25 episodes. After watching two in a row, I need to take a break, so I put the HDX down on the table and come back in an hour or so. Restarting the HDX shows the series on the carousal, but when I click on the icon, it gives me a spinning cursor icon and waits forever, and never actually loads the video list. I timed 10 minutes on this behavior once. I've tried disconnecting/reconnecting to wi-fi, rebooting, etc, and can't determine why this happens. And it _only_ happens with the video app. Everything else is snappy as I could hope. I know it is not my WiFi, which is a dual-band BG/N router. Connecting at N speeds, I get 75% signal strength. Dropping down to BG speeds gives me full strength. But either way, signal strength is strong enough, and everything else works as expected, so that I know it is not latency that causes this. It is something with the way Amazon remembers where I stopped off, caching my last viewed video and position in the video. Even going into the previously downloaded content exhibits this behavior.Edit: if I force-kill the Amazon Video app, this behavior is no longer apparent, so I still feel confident in my suspicion that it is something software-wise, or something with Amazon's services, and unrelated to user error.So long story short, I find it is a minor flawed upgrade, but one still worth perusing.", "Date": "October 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Upgrade from the HD", "Author": "Willy Wailer", "ReviewID": "RMP1TPKL887RJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my 6th Kindle and my third Fire having started with the original.

It is a nice little tablet otherwise, or so it appears, but I can not justify 3 stars (\"Okay\") because it is not okay to pay $324 and be stuck with a tablet ereader with purple-blue glowing all around the ebook page edge.EDIT: I just boxed up the HDX and will be returning it tomorrow. I also noticed that blue/purple fringe on webpages, again very annoying. Also the page curl feature when turning pages of an ebook was not working-- yes i had that setting turned on (I checked) and yes i tried it on about six random ebooks of mine that I purchased through amazon. I checked other [non-kindle] tablets at the local store today and they did not have that blue fringe glow, in fact the original Kindle HD was a clean white; seems to be in the HDX line as well as the Kindle Paperwhite (which as I said I decided to keep as it is so lightweight and I like the backlighting).

I own a Note 3, MSI GT70, Ipad4, Note 10.1 2014, and a few older tablets for reading including an underwhelming 2012 HD refurbished Kindle. I was annoyed with the old HD for many reasons and was going to return it until my son stole it for Kindle Free Time, which btw, is worth the subscription. However, as many people do who don't have multiple screen homes (Kindle HD 2012 was first and only at the time) I was annoyed by its limits and didn't see it's merits.Even with my plethora of fancy and infancy devices I missed Amazon's set up for books and video streaming. I could have got the all new version of the HD cheaply but I thought for a few dollars more having the most recent Kindle would've hurt, would have all the product support (os updates, lending library, and Prime HD streams). However, what I didn't know about was the free Prime downloads they added!!!!!Unfortunately this feature will only be amazingly useful on Kindle with higher memory. It makes me want to cry. :( If you want to store your music and have up to four or so 1080p movies downloaded for offline use 16 gigs is too small. It's the case for any tablet, and to be honest 32 is really very little. The os your apps and games will eat that space in no time. It's not like the olden days.Aside from the os eating all my space, I have to say if you're a Prime Member the HDX is a need. It's so lovely watching videos for free that were optimized for your device in impressive full 1080p. I had no idea how useful this would be for more than a bedside companion. No 4G or purchases necessary to enjoy a show while you're waiting at the doctor. In that respect alone, if you're a loyal Amazon subscriber regardless of the tablet this is a no brained thing you will enjoy.The old HD lags and is slow, but this model is fast. You can write accurately and with ease. The battery life might make you sad, but if you're reading I believe you have 17 hours. Which, is totally why you own a fire right? ;)The app store is still limited, and behind ios and android in updates and releases, but Amazon is working on getting exclusive games for its tablet owners like the Telltale Walking Dead series. Which is amazing...I'm pregnant and struggling with a lot of physical issues and have been confined to my bed so gadgets have become very important. I doubt I could rationalize spending $300 of tech money on an 8.9 or even a 7 inch HDX when for that I could purchase a Nexus 10 or 7, or even a used retina ipad mini, but I can't say I don't want one. (There is one on my wishlist).If you're new to technology and tablets you will love an HDX, if you're a loyal Amazon Prime fan and use their wonderful services then you will enjoy this. It's fast. So fast, and streams in true HD with proper broadband connection so you will only miss the downloads when you're mobile. We all know Kindle Ebooks beat all other ebooks, and Amazon makes the best reading app. It's still an impressive ereader, and the Goodreads integration makes my nerdy soul happy.Cons are it's still a bit heavy for a reader, but a nice case with a strap should remedy that. No back camera, so if this is going to be your main tablet you will be saddened. No HDMI port but those are becoming dinosaur tech, and adapters or Miracast exists now for older tv's. No Google Play store... But I have to say something as a techie dork. Amazon I hope you're listening, you guys almost have it right. What do I mean?You're providing great hardware for discounted prices and adding amazing customer service to your product for no additional cost. *Slow Clap* You're producing Amazon Exclusive content that is available only on your devices, but you allow other devices access to your main features so you're not self isolating either like Apple can.The HDX is truly a step in the right direction of you guys can do the following:Open The Play Store. Trust your products and store, it's great. Apps are discounted, and fair. Limiting yourself in this area is hurting you. I believe you'll see the errors of your ways here. Have exclusive content and offer your own, and win the internet even more than you already have.Step the prices down for the bigger memory tablets. You're not selling machines, you're selling a portal to one of the best services out there. I save so much money using your physical stores alone!! Your videos are beautifully optimized. Your tablets are now impressive, and no one can best your customer service for the services you provide. So, since you're selling physical products, movies, and exclusive content take a bit more of a hit on them HDX tablets so the service is available to more people everywhere.Allow us to customize the carousel. We know it's a Kindle, but give us some options. Let us display a book collection up there instead of all the recently opened things. Remove from carousel is one of my least favorite things. I don't mind the special offers, because there are great deals and recommendations there but allow us some level of customization and I don't mean those weird decals.Let Google into your hearts all the way. Give us a normal page or two with widgets. I love the folders feature.If you made those tweaks your tablet might win the internet completely. (Maybe usb 3.0 too)That all being said this is a great tablet for Prime members, readers, and streamers. The 16 gig HDX is worth keeping around for a long time, and I believe newbies and tech lovers alike will be happy with the hardware.If this is your only tab expect app store limits and some frustrations, but Amazon is really working to improve those things, and HDX owners will reap the benefits of this in the future. Music sounds great for back speakers and is the best I've heard from any non Bluetooth connected tablet yet. Price is still good. May Day is useful for even the savviest of us because it saves time. If you're not going to be a Prime Member, you want the biggest selection of apps and all of their updates immediately and this is going to be your main and only device... you're not a reader... or you're looking for a productivity or Jack of all trades machine this isn't for you. Don't buy it then give it a horrible review. This is a media tab. Movies, music, books, and shopping. All the best things in life. It does do some productivity but if that's what you need look elsewhere.When you pick up an HDX you're picking up well crafted fun. The pixels are so pretty you'll want to shed a tear. Amazon's media access is so extensive you'll want for little, and combined with other services, you may just want for nothing.If you get an HDX no matter what you will find things that will bring you joy, hopefully for a few years to come. I wish I paid full price for device help if it malfunctions (they all do) because dealing with Amazon directly is usually a dream, but I got a great deal. I am absolutely pleasantly surprised and taken with this device, and I think you will be too if this is what you choose for your ereading and Amazon media needs.", "Date": "March 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best tablet/e-reader on the market!

Something that could do it all but in a new fun way. My main requirements: camera, good price, and toddler friendly. I liked that the kindle fire hdx not only met all my requirements but far exceeded them also. It has FreeTime for kids which is well worth it alone, my daughter has unlimited instant access to hundreds of books, videos, and games with her favorite characters. You can get a subscription (4.99/month for one child 9.99 for a family) or just set up the child's own profile and fill it with the plenty of free kids apps available. I love that it's an android operating system. The apps are everything I need, yeah it's not hooked up with Google play or anything but I haven't found that to be a problem. Every app I wanted and am used to using on my iPhone is still available and all of my daughter's favorite apps are still here too. The picture and clarity of the screen is amazing and I found it to be much nicer than any of the other tablets I looked at. It has a great design, easy to hold for both adult and child, the sound is clear and great, it's super fast, I enjoy the silk browser, it is easy to use (if you are familiar with modern technology), we have been using it like crazy for a week now and there's isn't a single fault we can find. My husband can't even believe how great the graphics are. I am thrilled with my purchase and couldn't be happier. I also love that it's Amazon, a company I trust, and provides easy access to anything I want to do. There's also an app that connects to your local library early so you can \"borrow\" books directly onto your kindle. Kindle is also a major name so everything already (for the most part) has kindle compatibility. I really can't say it enough: I love our kindle. It's perfect and amazing and just what I wanted.

Besides, I have all of my bookmarks and notes that I haven't learned how to transfer to the Fire HDX. We chose the 7\" size because it's easier to carry in a purse or pocket. Keep in mind that the screen takes up the whole dimension, so it's a larger screen than the Kindle that has the keyboard at the bottom. It's really easy to read. We had our Kindle Fire in the car the other day and needed to look up a contact. That's when I discovered that it's like trying to read my phone's screen in the sunlight. Impossible. So I ordered anti-glare screen protectors. I hope that takes care of the glare. While we do love the Kindle Fire KDX Wi-Fi, I've noticed some problems that maybe aren't a problem to others. I had my Fire with me at church and wanted to jot down on my calendar something that I need to do on a date coming up in a couple of weeks. I noticed there was a Calendar icon, so I opened it to the date I wanted and discovered it wouldn't let me type my note. Why would it be necessary to have the calendar linked to the Internet if I don't care a thing about synchronizing it with my computer? I just wanted a nice little place to jot down the date of something. We don't use smart phones so I didn't think about this sync thing. I guess I just want something simple and old fashioned. At any rate, I had to wait a couple of hours until I got home and could link to the Internet simply to type my note on the calendar.Since this is high definition I was kind of excited when I saw the camera icon. I figured I'd get much nicer pictures than on my 7 year old digital camera. So I clicked on camera and saw myself. I read directions to see how I change the camera to showing what a regular view finder would see and had to chuckle when I found out it's just a one-way camera. Therefore, I took a picture of my Christmas tree by turning my back to the tree and holding the Fire over my shoulder so I could see what it saw. I got a good picture, but that's an awkward way to take a picture. So I guess I won't be using it for much more than Skyping.Things we love about the Kindle Fire HDX: the special offers (which I thought would be annoying) only show up when the device is off, so you don't have to interrupted by pop-ups. Wonderful! It's like the pictures you see on the old Kindle when it's off, only it is advertising instead of pictures of famous authors. It's quicker to manipulate between items. For instance, if you are reading the Sunday School lesson and want to go to a scripture reference, it's just a click away, then an arrow click back to where you were. It's faster to move between pages, chapters, etc. with a swipe of the fingers rather than clicking the page buttons on the old Kindle. (But we still love our old Kindles and will not be getting rid of them anytime soon). We love the bright picture and the fact that it can be read in low light (unlike the old Kindle which has no backlight). The high definition is really pleasing to the eye.We haven't tried Mayday yet, but from the commercials that feature appears to be a real boon to people who are not truly tech savvy (like we're not). I think this is a gadget everyone can find a good reason to own as it is much cheaper than an IPad and most other tablets. It looks great and works intuitively. Everything that's really important to us (and the reason we wanted it) is downloaded onto the device, making it unnecessary to be online away from home. The only thing that might have been nice and could be the reason we may someday opt for smart phones is that we can't use a barcode feature whereby you can skip printing a coupon and instead have the barcode on your device for the restaurant or store to scan.", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Beats the Ipad hands down!", "Author": "M.

It's simple to download an app.  No passwords required.  The Ipad requires an Apple PW EVERY time you want to download an app, and you have to make sure you remember it EXACTLY, because if you don't, the system won't let you in, and there's no way to store your password so it will fill in automatically.

I knew I was getting all 3 kids a kindle fire for Christmas (a different review coming for those), but for myself, the decision was tough since I already have an iphone and feel like an ipad is just a bigger version of the iphone but it's not a phone - so part of me thought \"whats the point?\". I wanted a device to-go and mostly for entertainment and books. I have a laptop and it's not fun to lug around when really I just want something to maybe do a little work email and gaming or read on. I also travel frequently and think I can get buy with just a tablet. The Kindle was my first. The results on it are:Music/Media:ipad would streamline all our content with my phone and itunes. If I went the ipad way I feel like we could just kinda have one system and get apple TV to rent movies on. And guess what?! KINDLE does it even better! I paid the 25.00 or whatever it was to upload ALL our 11,000 songs to the cloud and the kids and I can all listen from the cloud or download to our devices. Now I will be researching a device to stream to TV.Speed:Some games lag on this device, but I am still new to it so I am unsure if it's the device or processor, or if it's the game itself. Overall though, the selection of games has been great and free or cheapBooks:You can't go wrong with Kindle books. They are generally MUCH cheaper than apple's books, and sometimes even free! I like the screen and the ease of turning \"pages\", etc. I am still learning about some of the highlighting features, and X-ray is really cool! I just figured that out tonight thanks to MAYDAY!Another great thing! MAYDAY!I have used it twice. I was wondering if they could see me but they cant - even though I can see them. You get a PERSON in AMERICA when you hit the mayday button, and it literally takes less than 10 seconds to connect to them. It really made me think I have to get one of these for my gramma. Really useful. No googling forever, no making an appointment at the genius bar 3 weeks in advance just to ask a simple question. Just hit mayday, reach a human, and ask! And while they answer you they are friendly and may offer up info about other features you didn't know the device had.Sound:I was surprised how good the sound is! Ususally small devices have a bit too much treble or tweet or something for me. This one has even sound. You can comfortably listen to music or something on it without feeling like you need to go get the bluetooth radio. (and it has bluetooth too!) Also sounds great with Beats headphones, but what doesn't?Screen:Is fantastic. Video quality is wonderful!Battery life:Pretty fair. Doesn't last all day if it's in constant use but doesn't take too long to charge either.Now the cons:*No way to track it if it's lost like you can in the icloud, though you can call amazon and they can essentially make it into a brick for whoever finds it. I would just like to see GPS tracking so you know where you left it. Or a way to make it chime somewhere if I can't find it in the house.*Plug is kind of angled and funky, so hard to plug it into the charger in the dark. Have to angle it just right.*NO REAR CAMERA - You can only take front facing \"selfies\" with it.*Not easy to quickly \"kill\" apps if you need to.

The experience for me is better than the HD in so many little ways, the cumulative effect is a joy.The much-improved definition is not dramatic in reading mode, but it is evident. And the improvement in videos is, to these old eyes, really obvious. Web surfing is significantly faster and crisper.Moreover, there are dozens of little tweaks in the Kindle environment that seem to address practically everything I found annoying in the HD, from the new option to ditch the home-page carousel, to a key that dismisses a stubborn keyboard, to a more functional and appealing video store look. Navigation is smoother, quicker and more animated.I have no complaints. And I'm looking forward to the new features that will be added, like the second screen and (possibly?) collections.BTW, I do see the very faint translucent blue border around light-background screens but it doesn't touch the type and doesn't bother me in the least.

As a device for browsing the web, viewing movies and, most especially, reading, it is the best device I've ever tried. It is not without its failings when compared to other tablets (or even the iPhone), but overall I like it. The review that follows is more of a semi-organized narrative vs a table of pros/cons or an organized feature list with scores.Rotation (for apps that support it) is really fast and seamless. The place where rotation doesn't do what I'd expect is email; more on that below.The response time when turned on is what you'd expect. It would be nice if it was easier to stop other apps from running; even iOS 6 has a straightforward way for this (much better in iOS 7). Amazon stuck with the slow & clunky Settings/Apps/Running method that has been in Android seemingly forever. Some apps get pretty unhappy with you if you force them to stop. You can reboot for a clean start, but that makes start-up pretty slow. A pity that while keeping this Android feature they disabled some other key features (see below for Apps issue).Books and even newspapers display their text and pictures beautifully. The paging is snappy unlike my older 2nd Gen Kindle, and for speech-enabled books, the speech synthesis system is decent. I LOVE the X-Ray feature. It is not perfect, but I assume it will just keep getting better.Silk is a decent web browser, but not as smooth as its name tries to imply. It is fast, but doesn't work with some important websites; and when it doesn't work it really doesn't work. Take Google Maps for instance. The display of Google Maps just plain sucks. No doubt about it. My iPhone handles Google Maps much better (and has a Google Maps app). No, I don't plan to take my Kindle on the road as a map device, but I would like to use it instead of my iPhone when a computer isn't handy; but that is not to be. To make things worse, there is no Google Maps app in Amazon's store. And to add insult to injury, you cannot install apps from Google Play unless you root your Kindle. That just plain sucks. This takes thousands of Android apps and puts them out of your reach. Amazon already has a \"don't install from other app stores\" switch there. When I turn that off, the Kindle HDX should just work with Google Play... I do not understand why Amazon made this choice and the Kindle HDX is poorer for it.I don't have many apps installed (some that I want to install I cannot -- see note above about Google Play). Some that I did install are ill-suited to my Kindle (e.g. Audubon Birds) as they have a fixed orientation and don't understand rotation. I'll probably stick to books and movies (and newspapers), which no doubt suits Amazon just fine.On the question of e-mail: the Kindle's email support looks pretty, but is pretty non-functional for me. I have an Exchange account plus some iMAP-only accounts that I setup. The Exchange account works really well, except for the Kindle's UI (see below) and some odd configuration things. For instance, no matter how many times I changed my notification sound, the HDX insisted on playing a different one. I even tried using the MAYDAY feature to see if the support gurus could help. I got my HDX on the first day they were available, so the support gurus will still learning the device and did not offer up anything I did not know. In the end I turned off notification and rely on my iPhone to alert me.The mail UI is disappointing in that when I rotate my HDX to landscape mode to gain reading space, the HDX instead insists on showing an Outlook-like 2 pane UI. I thought there was no way to change this, until another user (thanks, Judy) pointed out that a 3-dot menu shows up when a message is selected. That menu allows you to switch to fullscreen mode while viewing the message.WORST THING OF ALL with email: The HDX would randomly mark some unviewed messages as read. This took me many, many days to figure out, and caused me to miss some time-critical messages. How do I know it's the HDX? It started after I setup my iMAP accounts on the HDX; it stopped when I deleted them (another ding vs. other devices I've used: no way to disable the account just for testing -- you must delete it or use it).It is nice that installing my Exchange mailbox brought over my contacts & calendar, though I really don't need yet another device chiming to remind me of meetings. So I use this more as a quick check when reading so I don't need to get my iPhone out.The virtual keyboard is ok, but only just ok. It isn't smart about things like automatically engaging the shift key after punctuation or on a new line (I thought I disliked that about the iPhone at times, but the HDX made me realize how handy it is -- sad that my year-old iPhone has a better typing UI than my new HDX though). The spacing makes it easier to type on than a phone, but I miss the iPhone's features (perhaps just because I've become used to them). I do like the running display of word choices that show up as I type.A general configuration gripe: why is there only 1 sound type to be configured? There are notifications for: email, apps, calendar... why just one sound? And why don't changes to that take hold? Sigh, yes it is a smaller detail but one that impacts the \"fit and finish\" of the device. It's not like Amazon hasn't shipped out a tablet-ish device before, so this disappointed me.Movies -- now this is a REALLY nice feature. The speakers on the HDX (especially with the origami cover in place -- separate review coming on that) are just ok; I'd plug a nice headset in to listen. It is very cool that you can download prime movies onto the device and go on the road with those. What I do not understand is why the HDX has no way to SEARCH for downloadable prime movies. Instead, you need to browse, movie-by-movie, to find the ones that can be downloaded. C'mon, Amazon... really?? I haven't watched a movie on my HDX yet but will on a future road trip. I just hope the battery holds up.The UI for viewing photos is marginal; there is no good way to search for, sort or group photos. You just need to scroll through them and try to spot what you want. Worse, when you copy pictures across the USB interface (yay for a USB interface -- with the display, the only other technical advantage the HDX has), the picture's creation date is tossed. The HDX sets the creation date to the date the picture was copied; I can see NO advantage to anybody except for the careless programmer who didn't have to add that feature to his or her spec. Once you find the picture you want though, the display is what you'd expect from the HDX. Again, if I really want to find a particular picture quickly, I guess I'll just go to my iPhone. I am not even sure I'll keep moving pictures to my Kindle.Music: don't use it. My iPhone syncs with iTunes and I also have an iPod. Moving all of that to Amazon's cloud or my HDX would require conversion from Apple's format. Just not worth the time. Some of my music was purchased from Amazon, and those songs are available. But it is a small subset. Top it off with marginal speakers in my configuration and, well I just don't use it.I am yet to try Skype, but I suspect it would work very well.The HDX comes connected to Amazon's store. That makes it easy to buy books or movies. If I ever remember to carry my HDX into my basement to watch movies, it could be an easy way to select a For Rent movie when I want to watch it through my XBox. Too bad the swipe-to-TV feature doesn't include using the Amazon XBox app... then I'd always take my HDX downstairs with me!That leads to another oddity: for some Kindle management features you have to leave Amazon's store app and use Silk (or your laptop or iPhone) to go onto the web. Why is that? I can buy stuff from Amazon (including expensive, physical merchandise), but if I want to add an email address to my \"approved for documents\" list I need to go sign-on via Silk and browse around their website to find that feature? Doesn't make sense to me.Now the Mayday feature -- it is a really nice idea. I am fairly technical, and when I ask for help it is usually on some detail (like why won't my changes to the Notification sound stick?) that is not easy to find in the documentation. Unhappily for me, the Mayday reps, while very eager to help, did not yet know the HDX very well and I was often put on hold while they went to research things. So I'd go back to reading something and sliding their little window around on my HDX... which got old pretty fast. It is, though, really nice to have that help available when they are able to help. I can hardly wait to try hitting Mayday on Xmas day just to see if they can handle the load ;-)So why did I give this device 4 stars? Because it replaced my older, 2nd gen Kindle and as I said above, it rocks in that role. If you want to view this as an iPad competitor, I think it fails as a general-purpose device that you'd take on the road instead of a laptop; hell my iPhone does a better job of that than this new HDX. But that isn't why I bought it.

Cordoba \"mxc\"", "ReviewID": "R3M0JZDWPQSSDE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I really wanted to like the kindle. It has a great price, awesome screen, and with an advertised 11 hour battery life (up to 17 hour if just reading according to Amazon) I figured this device was the perfect companion.After a few weeks of testing and timing, I can confidently say that for the vast majority of user scenarios, the battery life is significantly worse. In fact, I have no idea how exactly Amazon came up with the 11 hour number.But lets start with the basics pros:- Screen is really nice (yes there is some slight blue light bleed around the edges, but Amazon has a complete explanation of why that is - and it's used to have the great color accuracy/gamut that the display has). Honestly, it was very little to bother me at all, and welcome the increase color gamut. The screen is superb.- Kindle Free Time: this is absolutely great. I can let my daughter play with the kindle with some serious restrictions. (what apps can be accessed, how long she can play, read or watch videos (3 distinct timers). She can't do purchases or anything else. I can't believe nobody had done something like this before. It's really amazing.Cons- Neutered android means that a lot of very popular android apps are not available, and you have to resort to side loading them, and not all work that well. I really wish they allowed a larger percentage of the Google Play store apps (all preferred)- thick border around the edges, where the display could be extended to be even more usable without increasing the size of the device. It's around a 1.5 inch diagonal of wasted space. The iPad min in contrast his just a 1/4 of an inch or so.- And the worst offender which causes this to be a 2 star product instead of 4 stars, is the misrepresented battery life. Partner has an iPad2, (10 hour claim) and it generally lives to those expectations, lasts all day off the plug, great.The Real Battery Life of the HDX which claims to be 11 hours (up to 17 reading!!) is closer to 5 hours.Here are the tests I did during the last 3 weeks:The first day, I downloaded several apps and got it setup, read some books to my daughter, and watched a movie. I used the mayday button to ask about sorting apps by age of your child (can't be done as of now). It couldn't have been more than 4 hours, and the device was already at 10% charge (down from a full 100% charge) so I was really disappointed, and started doing a series of tests:Things to note:* Wifi only model (3g would suck the battery even more)* brightness was set to 50%.* I'm a huge fan of Amazon, and this is the first Amazon product that has really let me down with their claims. I owned a kindle keyboard, and now a paperwhite 2 - both of which I love. Customer service has always been second to none. Basically, there is no reason for me to \"bash\" this product. I am a tech person, and I am aware battery life varies quite a bit by usage, but this is a serious issue not just a small variation. Amazon failed to deliver big time on their battery life promise.Test 1:* 3 hours of mostly reading (kids books, so they had colors and things, my daughter flipping through the pages)* 1 hour of videos (she was unfortunately drawn to Barney)* Half hour of games (some simple puzzle games, nothing 3D intensive or anything requiring full use of the graphic processor)* Battery was down to 20% and I started surfing the web and others until it ran down in 1.75 hours.So basically, during a reading heavy session (17 hour amazon claim), the device failed to last 6 hours.Test 2:- Charged it overnight, let my daughter do whatever she wanted with it (using the awesome Kindle Free Time). She mostly watched videos and flipped through some books. She also opened a game or two (Again simple puzzle games, no 3D battery intensive games). She had breakfast in between and then lunch. And then brought the device to me because the battery was dead. The device lasted just over 4 hours...In contrast the iPad, where she likes to play with 3D puzzles and several other 3D apps (Mr Potato), she plays with it several days before it ever runs down.  I can confidently say that playing with apps, the iPad lasts at least twice as long as the kindle fire.Test 3:- Sporadic use throughout he day. I figure I'd try a really subtle scenario.- Light web browsing (not more than 30 minutes)- Some videos (1.5 hours)- occasional book (only 5 minute spans, or flipping through pictures)- The device was on the sleep state most of the time.- Battery life was at 30% that night. So 70% of the battery was lost during some 3 maybe 4 hours of use.I will do a strictly video test and post it later.But nothing I have seen indicates that any normal usage will get you anywhere near the 11 hour claim.", "Date": "December 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love It", "Author": "P.

I can compare them to a Galaxy Tab 7\" and they come out far ahead, particularly that Amazon has realized the \"natural\" position for a 7\" tablet is horizontal, not vertical. The screen is amazing, which you'd expect from the stats, but for a tiny 7\" device, the speakers are actually quite capable.

It fell off my couch about 12 niches give or take on to a \"CARPETED\" floor and the screen shattered! lol Nothing wrong with the inside but once the screen crack the touch screen stopped working properly.I have owned quite a few tablets in my life and I have NEVER seen one break this easily. They have offered to send me some older model refurbished kindle in exchange for about a $100 fee. (Older Model) keep in mind. Apparently Amazon (Kindle) department only offers a warranty on inner parts in such cases something mechanical goes wrong. (No Screen Protection).Do your homework before selecting this product. I believe some places like Samsung Galaxy have a screen protection program they do. Amazon really should offer a better broken screen replacement program or at least let people send them in to get the screen replaced on theirs at a low price vs having to replace it at $149 just so they can turn around and resell yours at a $129 profit.Kinda sad program they have currently.Anyway..................I would suggest looking into other that are much more durable.

The mobile data appealed to me.Soon after I bought this device, I had an issue with an invalid SIM card. I worked together with both Amazon and AT&T; (the service provider for my 4G LTE). It was determined that the device's sim card reader was broken and the entire device needed to be replaced. I had to buy another device. I was given a discount on the condition that I send the old device back. I complied, therefore spending about $600 for the device.Now I have the new device. The sim card only works part of the time. I have to frequently reboot the device in order to get the sim card to work. Also, the Wi-Fi also stops working at times as well. I would have sent this device back for a refund, but I would have only gotten part of my money back. Therefore, I am now stuck with a device that does not serve the purpose for which I bought it.I have become accustomed to using the Kindle Fire product line, so I am not familiar with Apple's products and their effectiveness. However, considering the fact that I have now spent well more than anticipated for a device with mediocre network capability (at best), I believe that an iPad would be the better choice.If you are looking to use this device primarily offline, it is wonderful. It has a fairly stable operating system, the appstore has grown exponentially since its launch, and the display is beautiful. However, if you are looking to use the mobile data and Wi-Fi heavily this device is not likely a good fit for you.

I searched to find the right box and found out the Netgear PTV3000 is the only one certified by Kindle to do it. I plugged it into my HDMI input on my Samsun plasma tv, found the connection procedures and shot the display over to my tv, after about 30 seconds or so it connects and everything works perfectly! I have a couple of little complaints about the Kindle in general. When I download movies to watch when I am not in Wifi mode, it takes a REALLY long time to download and if you try to download them in full 1080p, it takes even longer. I have settled for 720p on most movies but still takes a while. Also, when I fling movies to the tv, it does show in HD but there is fairly obvious pixelization so it is not as good as watching a Blu Ray disc. It also cuts out just a little bit every now and then but no big issues there. I got my email synced to the Kindle and that works fine. I also ordered Amazon Prime so I could watch free movies and tv shows but I would say less than half of them are actually free, which is pretty annoying. I will not pay $2 or $3 bucks to watch an older tv show when the reruns are free on tv. It would be nice if they had an option to watch them free with commercials or to pay for them. The same for older movies, we were going t Ho watch some older Christmas movies this year and several of them were not on HD Prime so you have to pay for a lot of older movies too. I am still getting to learn all the modes and I have not played any games yet so can't really reply to those. I do wish I had spent a few more bucks on the Kindle with the larger memory though, if you download a few movies, they will eat your storage space right up. Hope these comments help anyone considering this. Also, I went with the 7\" Kindle instead of the 8.9\" because I just could not justify paying almost $200 extra bucks for just 2 inches of extra screen when everything else seemed the same. I am quite happy with the 7\" screen as I use it on my train rides to and from work and I think the bigger one would be more cumbersome.

It does appear to be just slightly more yellow on the right than the left, but it's not blotchy / spotty like the HDX it's replacing. I did an experiment to verify that I'm not imagining this tint - I set the Kindle overlapping my Macbook laptop screen, and side-by-side the difference in white is quite noticeable. However, since the tint is consistent and not blotchy, it doesn't take long for my brain to \"tune out\" the yellowness and accept the white as white while reading. I'm updating my rating from 2 stars to 3 stars. I'd give it 4 stars, because I like the tablet as a whole, except that it took me three tries to obtain a Kindle HDX with a \"tolerable\" screen (I'll be keeping this latest Kindle). If you were to put all three HDXs I've used side-by-side, each screen would be noticeably different than the other when reading text on a white background. That just should not be the case.-- ORIGINAL REVIEW --I would give the Kindle Fire HDX four or five stars if not for the problems I've had with the screen. I'm on my second HDX and have just requested my third. My first HDX had something akin to \"dead pixels\" - a brown spot under the glass that looked like someone focused the sun on that spot with a magnifying glass. I returned that device immediately, only to get a replacement with a different but even more distracting screen defect that I can best describe as \"muddiness.\"I've owned a variety of laptops and tablets over the years, including the previous Kindle HD, and I've never encountered a screen that looks like you're viewing it through a thin layer of dirty water. The uneven \"dirty\" white is mostly noticeable when reading black text on a white background - which is most of the time when using the browser, news apps, or even just reading a Kindle book.When I noticed this right away on the new HDX, I remembered the story of iPhones having a similar problem due to a screen adhesive that takes time to dry, so I kept my current tablet for close to a month, using it every day with the hope that this muddiness would go away on its own. It has not. It is HIGHLY distracting, and despite the crisper resolution, I find myself wanting to return to my old Kindle HD. I've requested a third HDX to replace this, but how many of these tablets must I go through to find one with even a decent display?Just in case you think I'm fussy, I have no problem with the blue glow on the sides. The glow is in the margins and doesn't overlap text or video. If the glow was the only issue, I'd still give this tablet 4 or 5 stars. Like I said, I have lots of screens in the house to compare this to, and it's obvious that Amazon's flagship tablet should be at least on par if not better than the average everyday LCD screen.Others have had similar problems (search \"yellow HDX\") , and yet others, including professional reviewers like Ars Technica, have NOT mentioned these screen problems. This and my own experiences lead me to believe that there is a breakdown in Quality Control / Quality Assurance in the manufacturing of these devices. At the very least, it appears that the manufacturer of the screen itself is letting substandard displays out onto the market. If that's the case, then you are \"rolling the dice\" when you order the HDX. I'm about to roll the dice one more time, and I'll update this review if / when I receive my third HDX.", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "I'll keep it short and simple", "Author": "jordan burks", "ReviewID": "R3V552VVOWGBLH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a fantanstic tablet.

Why would I pay $15 to lose out on saving money??Cons:-Physical buttons placed in slightly strange places if you use the device primarily in portrait mode (I only switch to landscape if a game I'm playing needs it or I'm watching a movie). I've had the kindle fire HD for almost a year so I'm used to the buttons being in a set place so if you're upgrading that's something to keep in mind.-Charger and headphone ports are slightly slanted so when plugged in the cords jut out in a strange way-The infamous purple/blue light (I personally don't mind it since everything else is so gorgeous but you definitely do notice it while reading so I'm including it in cons I guess as a warning to others)-I preferred the curves on the back, if it ain't broke why fix it? BUT if you've never used a kindle fire HD you won't miss it at all so this isn't really a con per se.Amazon has outdone itself in my opinion. I was a big fan of the Kindle HD (which I had for 8 months) and used it constantly. I prefer Kindle greatly to my iPhone and Kindle tablets may be the reason I switch to an android phone because of how preferable I find it. The ease of use in transferring books and music is unbeatable. Drag and drop and be done with it! And though Amazon tries to push itself on you (no google market on the kindle, amazon cloud, ect) they never do anything as annoying as apple with iTunes. Kindle marries together the simplicity and straight forwardness of using an iPhone (EVERYBODY knows how to use one of those) with the customization and ease of an android. Beginners and pros alike can find something to enjoy on the Kindle HDX.And what's better is everything that people mentioned they didn't like in their reviews of the Kindle HD, Amazon fixed with this tablet. They learned their lesson and included the charger adapter, they made HD content more accessible and better quality, and upped the ante with two more processors with those who felt the Kindle couldn't keep up with their content. They even upgraded Silk to be a better browser! This is basically unprecedented with physical stores because they don't have a consistent reviewing system where the consumer literally says what they liked and don't like. It's great to know Amazon is listening.I'm very satisfied with this purchase (bought from Radioshack, not amazon so it would be here on time for Christmas) and will continue to buy Amazon's tablets whenever they come out and it's time to upgrade. I may update the review as time goes on because I DID just get the kindle for Christmas, but I've been a big fan of Amazon and Amazon Kindle tablets for years now.Edit 1: I've had the kindle for a few weeks now and I still adore it, but the buttons are quickly becoming a big hassle. I don't have 50 dollars to kick out for the official cases but because of the sudden change of the buttons locations finding different cases is extremely hard unless you search through amazon itself. For those who like ordering from amazon this is not really an issue, but those who would like to find a bargain without paying shipping on a case this is a downside.I was split on the button at first because I understand they wanted to change where the buttons are but because of the fact that I can never remember where the power button is and the case issue that's definitely a con.", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wow, the screen and sound are amazing", "Author": "Mema \"Wife, Mother, Mema, Sister\"", "ReviewID": "R3AR2BBRDJ0499", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I generally read on my Kindle and this HDX is great for reading, yes there is a hint of purple around the edges but frankly once I start reading I don't even notice it, probably would never have noticed it but for other reviews.

I purchased this as a birthday gift for my 7 year old, who was obsessed with my iPad. I was going to purchase an iPad mini, but I thought the freetime feature would be perfect to avoid arguments about time  allowed and the price is hard to beat. First thing I noticed when I opened the device and held it is that it is very lightweight...this does make it easier to hold, but it also makes it feel a little flimsy, which was worrisome considering it is going to a child (albeit a very conscientious child who takes good care of her things). Set-up was a little obnoxious, but nothing terribly difficult, it took about 15 minutes all told. The screen resolution is indeed fantastic as all the rave reviews state. Also, the subscription service for childrens content is amazing, I highly recommend it for the variety of content (books, games, videos, etc.) available for a steal (less than $3 a month). While the Freetime feature is great to set time limits, allows access to great subscription content, and is very easy for children to navigate, it does have a few flaws. It consolidates all Apps into one group, so while you may want to limit time spent on games, you may want to allow your child access to things like an alarm clock feature or Skype. There is no means to differentiate between apps, and once their time is used, they will not be able to access anything which falls under that type of content. And to be honest, I still have to deal with my child's attempts to negotiate more time as she knows that the Freetime feature is customizable, so while it may be helpful for younger kids, don't expect it to eliminate an older child's attempts to garner more screen time. Second, the camera feature is really only for video-chatting purposes as it only faces the individual, so taking photos is pretty much out of the question. Finally, our first device froze irrecoverably after three days of use...major bummer. Amazon was amazing and promptly shipped us out a new device free of charge, and while this could have been a total fluke, it happened, and I have serious doubts about long term longevity of the device. BUY A WARRANTY if you need this to last more than a year or two. So having had the device for about two months now, I feel confident in saying that IF price is your determining factor and you are looking for a gift for a younger child, go for the kindle. If not, the iPad mini is probably a better bet for overall build, functionality, and versatility for an older child.", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "HDX = Epic Win", "Author": "Dairenn Lombard", "ReviewID": "R1NDUAFBCNASNA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, owning a tablet for me seemed like a little bit of an oxymoron.  I am a power user--so I need a full-sized keyboard, a mouse (or trackball since space is at a premium for me usually), a huge screen and lots of storage, memory and processing power.  A laptop with that much capability costs nearly twice as much as a desktop, so that's what I use.  But more and more, I've been wanting to watch videos, browse photos or maybe quickly check e-mail and social media when I can't be near a computer because of privacy concerns or workplace rules.  So, I bought a laptop, but no matter how light, thin or small they get (with the old, short-lived netbooks coming quite close to what I needed), it was never convenient to whip them out on the bus or train, or while waiting for them.  Not to mention prudent in certain parts of town, unlike a tablet, where it might look like you're just reading a book in the right case.Before the Kindle Fire, your choice was an iPad or so-called \"affordable\" tablets that left you jealous of iPad users.  For me, the value proposition was poor--nearly $700 with no expandable storage, replaceable battery, the ability to use the on-board storage via USB for transferring or backing up data without the use of iTunes, and other edge-case use case scenarios that doesn't apply to the average Apple user, but did to me.  Then, with the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" tablet, I at least got USB access to the onboard storage, and the ability to load apps that let me watch my video files and browse photos in slideshow mode, and at 50% of the cost.Plus, while other Android tablets like the Galaxy by Samsung and the Nexus by Google are becoming increasingly valuable offerings, I am actually a fan of the Amazon content ecosystem.  Google Play, to me, just doesn't seem to be \"there\" yet.  And I already benefit from iTunes on my iPod and desktop computer.  The Kindle gives me my favorite way to enjoy movies and, in particular, my favorite TV shows.  And Amazon's selection is vast (rivaling iTunes and beating out NetFlix and especially Hulu), especially for TV shows and music, having the biggest music library thanks to AutoRip on catalog items not even available at iTunes.  Even their movie rental system works better--being cheaper, less prone to experiencing spontaneous failures or other errors and integrating wonderfully with their entire system.  For example, movie recommendations can be based on past DVD (or even VHS) purchases, if you've been buying things from them for that long.It's easy to view rented movies on a full-sized HD TV (it was even easier with the mini HDMI output on the previous model), but today's LED HD sets are largely able to Wi-Fi their way onto the Internet, so this missing feature will largely go unnoticed, even for a tech head like me.  I understood going in that the purpose of the Amazon Kindle family of wireless electronic devices is to serve as an easy, convenient, user-friendly access point of their content whether it's e-books, newspapers and magazines or music, movies, TV shows and games.  The edge here is that you can have this remarkable value proposition at a far less expensive price point--even on the 8.9\" tablet.Of course, what I didn't like when I got the original HD 8.9\" was the nasty performance, particularly apparent during use of Silk, the Kindle Fire web browser.  The CPU was so obviously lacking in power for handling the majority of web pages I was visiting to look at pictures.  At first, I thought it was the sluggishness of 54mbps Wi-Fi compared to the 1 GBit/Sec. wired Ethernet connections available to my desktop and work laptop computer, but with this upgrade, I discovered that is not true.  The #1 benefit to upgrading from the HD to the HDX model was, by far, the fact that it is snappy.  Everything took forever on the old Kindle Fire HD.  On this device, I am flipping between apps, bringing up pages as fast as allowed by the bandwidth that I and the web server have, transferring files over USB at true 2.0 speeds without slowing down to calculate how many files have to be copied first.  Most important of all, apps do not crash all the time on the HDX like they began to on the old Fire HDs.  Pages routinely crashed Silk, even more so after the upgraded client, which supported a bunch of new features that I liked, but had maddening stability issues.And it wasn't just the browser.  The built in Amazon video app for playing movies streaming or downloaded from Amazon natively were forcing a hard reset of the device from time to time.  Sometimes, several times in a row.  My tablet was beginning to fall into disuse because I was beginning to expect any video playback was going to cause crashes.  Couple that with running out of space for loading new videos, and it was looking bad.Not so with the Kindle Fire HDX.  FireOS 3.0 is stable!  I opted for max storage at 64 GB, but, to keep it affordable, went with the smaller 7\" device, which ended up being significantly lighter and therefore easier to handle with one hand instead of two, and super fast to take out and put away in my bag.  Even though it's 2.9\" less diagonal viewing area, I barely notice the difference when browsing photos or watching video.  Especially since the color accuracy and sharpness of the 1080 (up from 720) HD-resolution video was instantly noticeable, even though it was over two weeks since I'd seen the display of the old HD 8.9\" that I had traded in.  I see the blue LED on pure white screens around the edges, but it doesn't bother me.  It actually looks pleasant to me.Between the stunning video display quality, super fast performance, stability, and expanded storage, I can now barley keep my hands off this thing.  I want to use it every chance I can get.

I wanted the download movie option, that was my justification, but also an added Kindle for where I eat breakfast and use the old HD Kindle for downloading podcasts and news; speaker volume is good on both this and last unit, vastly superior to first Kindle.  The performance is far superior in terms of speed, and in spite of the limitations others mention about downloading movies, I am okay with the limitations, use it to watch movies on plane trips or when there is no wifi. The unit is lighter, thinner and overall it has a feel of being well built, though so did the others. Reading it in bed is a bit easier, and it clearly picks up internet wifi better.The HDX is light years ahead of the first version, I have all three.  The first version works fine, easy to read, but the HD and now the HDX are major upgrades from the first one. I love the fact many books can be read out loud with a good voice and accuracy, which I use while eating.It is hard to imagine what the next upgrade will offer, and what their encore will be to motivate me to upgrade again.  It seems this is everything one could want, but then again, I thought that with the last HD Fire I bought.

I didn't want to spend $500 on a table when in a year or two they will make a new version and your will be outdated.  The screen is so nice and beautiful when watching movie and tv on hd.  It look just as good or even better than my hd tv at home.  The apps load very fast like almost instant to just a few second.  Surfing the web is also fast as well when your shopping online and I do like it that it is so light that I can hold it in one hand so your hand won't get tired quickly.The pro:- super fast (on WiFi) (must be even faster on 4G)- graphic is excellent (good for movie and games)- very light which you can hold longer without tired your handThe con:- only has front camera- no memory slot (if you need more memory, buy the 32GB or 64GB which is like $40 or $80 more) (which I think it pricy compare to buying a memory card)- there is not a lot of good apps compare to iTunes and google play. (I was hoping to find a better GPS app)Overall, I am very happy with my kindle fire hdx.  I got the 32GB with special offer.  By the way, some people paid $15 just to remove the ad.  To me, the ad is not in my way at all.  It only there when the screen is lock due to inactivity, but after you unlock the screen, it will not be there any more.

I was unsure, wondering if the reported flaws were consistant throughout it's lifespan. But I will say now that I've had a chance to play around with it, it really is an incredible piece of technology, especially for people who are new to tablets and want to get their feet wet.As the case with the Kindle Fire HD, the HDX has a forked variation of android. This means that they are slower to update and their choice of apps will be limited. But this doesn't really mean that it's a terrible downside, especially since you have more access to amazon features, something that most android tablets do not provide enough of. The user interface itself is fairly easy to navigate, but limited in customization due to it's OS being heavily modified by amazon. As mentioned previously, if you are new to tablets, you can't go wrong with the HDX, in either of it's models. If you aren't used to technology in general, then this tablet will be perfect for you. It teaches you how to operate the tablet, which swipes do what and so forth. If that doesn't convince you, then the new mayday might do the job. When you press this button, you can communicate with a member of amazon's technical support team who can temporarily take control of your tablet to show you how to get from point a to point b. The difference between stock android and the modified android OS (aka Fire OS 3.0 as amazon calls it) are obvious, starting with the carousel. The carousel itself is a tray of apps and media that you use or prefer to use the most. Though I do love it, my only complaint is that I wish I could modify what gets added to it, so I could have more control over it. Below the carousel are your installed apps, which I absolutely adore, especially since stock android forces you into multi-home screen configuration (which I hate).The choice of apps may be few, but the selection of media is massive to say the least. If you live in north america, then you may know from experience that some videos, books, and music simply aren't available in the google play store. I have to be honest though, I never really did care much for google play's selection of apps, so having a limited selection really isn't that bad. Amazon offers a free app of the day though, so whatever app that is offered for free may vary from a free to paid variation. So downloading it will mean that you will have that app forever if you snag it. So the answer to the question \"what do you get out of the amazon ecosystem?\" is this, their entire cache of media, which is nearly perfect. Some movies and episodes might only be available for rent, but that is still more then what you get with google play. Let's be honest here, when you are buying a tablet, you aren't buying it for what isn't available in another person, but what is available to you. With amazon's x-ray, any x-ray enabled song gives you access to it's lyrics. X-Ray enabled movies and television episodes give you access to which actors play what and things of that sort, allowing you to find out who that one actor is through the help of IMDB. Books give you access to characters and which parts of the story they might show up in and so on. Keep inmind that while HD, HDX and paperwhite owners will find themselves enjoying x-ray, non-amazon tablets do not have this feature. If you have prime, then you will find yourself with the option to download prime-enabled movies and episodes. Having access to prime's library really is something to write home about, especially if you can't stand netflix. I have yet to fully test out the prime-enabled features, but I can safely say that prime owners will LOVE the HDX. The downside to this is that you can only download a handful of their videos (in my experience). But never the less, instant video is still a worthwhile feature to consider for prime members.If you have access to children of any sort (be they through babysitting or your own grandchildren), then freetime will be the answer to some of your problems. You can grant them special limited access to the tablet, which can be very helpful I'd imagine. But considering that I don't have kids nor do I babysit, I wouldn't know. So this is strictly up to you in how you prefer freetime. Playing a song, reading an e-book, or watching a movie is what the HDX is designed for. It offers incredible HD-quality graphics and stunning audio to make your experiences enjoyable. With specifications that are equal to what the nexus 7 offers and considering that there is a 64gb varient (which I own), it is the perfect media-consumption tablet to bring with you on vacation.If you use the internet frequently enough, then you will have nothing to fear! The HDX has a decent email client and web browser (aka silk). Silk is comparable to the stock android browser and should you not want to use the various side-loaded youtube apps, you can still access youtube via Silk and the quality does not suffer in the slightest. The email client does what any email client should and sticks to it, checking and deleting emails. Though I will admit there is a lack of \"select all emails\" option, but this hardly matters to me. Being able to check my email is all I prefer. The calender (or day planner if you prefer) is simple and to the point, proving that not every feature has to come with forty or fifty functions.If you choose not to pay that extra 30.00 to remove special features, you are treated to a lockscreen with ads. I understand that should you pay to remove the ads, you are treated to a handful of features. But having ads on my kindle is nice, since it gives me access to new sales and I like to save money if I can help it.In the end, if you like stock android and long for it's customizability, then don't get an HDX. An HDX is for one group of people, fans of the amazon ecosystem, people who are aware of it not being similar to a stock android tablet and are fine with it. This tablet does well at what it was designed for, media consumption. Which honestly, is something that I prefer to be honest. I have a nexus 7 here and it didn't offer HALF of the functions that are found on an HDX. There is no having to pay over 20.00 to fix the problems present in stock android and thanks to mirror cast, you can use your HDX to stream movies to any mirror cast-enabled device.

The biggest issue I have is no Google play store access.

I got it to take advantage of the lending library, Amazon prime (eventually when I feel like taking the $79 annual hit), and the features it does offer.

Since half of my media contents are purchased from Amazon, I thought it was time to look at the Kindle HDX, the only non-Apple tablet I would consider because of the specs and size.I was not disappointed with the size, both dimensions and weight. The tablet was easy to hold and I actually found the placement of the buttons in the back easy to get used to and use. I did notice the blue haze around the screen, but that did not both me.The reasons why I returned my unit were:1. I can only access half of the media I owned. The other half is on iTunes.2.

May", "ReviewID": "R2AQU6NH2GG4A5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just received the seven-inch Amazon Kindle Fire HDX (64 GB, Wi-Fi, Includes Special Offers) today and have been using it now for about four hours. This review will evolve as I continue to use the device, but my initial impressions are...this is a fantastic device for the money.I still own a first-generation Kindle Fire whose stock OS and user experience were so bad I had to eventually root it and install stock Android Jelly Bean on it to make it usable. That Amazon has progressed from that to this in two years' time is remarkable.If you're worried about value, don't: just buy one if you think you want one (that's kind of a quote from a photography expert who has a blog and reviews a lot of gear). The value for the money here is incredible.Here are my pros and cons, which I will expand upon as I return to this review and update it periodically as I do more with the HDX.PROS:+ The screen. I've been trying to get an hour's worth of work done at the office, but I just can't take my eyes off the display. It is gorgeous, bright, sharp, accurate. Everything the pro reviewers have said about this display is true, but it doesn't prepare you for the actual first glimpse. It's an awesome panel.+ The sound. I fired up \"Smokey and the Bandit\" and was perplexed by the quality and volume of sound coming from the seemingly tiny speakers on the back of the device. Despite their location, it seems like the sound is coming right out of the screen. The engineers knocked a homerun here. Unless you're practicing privacy, headphones or external speakers are not essential.+ The design. The tapered edges give the device an ultra-slim appearance when viewed from most angles from the front side of the device, yet the body has sufficient thickness to be gripped and held easily. When the screen is off, it is very difficult to see the screen's location within the bezel...like a solid sheet of black. It is well-built, but it is light. And it's balanced well--I'm using an old Incipio stand originally designed for a Galaxy Nexus phone with the HDX, and it's perfectly stable and solid.+ Ease of use and setup. Within five minutes of unboxing, the device was ready for use, and that included downloading an OS update, setting up two email accounts, a Facebook account and a Twitter account. Amazon's ability to pre-register the device prior to shipping is huge.CONS- Blue screen edges. Most of the time they're not distracting, and I understand that they're \"necessary\" given the fact Amazon chose to use blue LED's to illuminate the screen and ensure close-to-100% color accuracy. But when browsing webpages or reading books, at my present stage of HDX enjoyment, they are a bit of a distraction. I'm hoping I get used to them. (10:56 AM, 12/23/13)- Amazon's app ecosystem. This is not a knock on the device but rather an indictment of Amazon's app store. But my hunch is that with the HDX devices developers will get cracking on making the freshest versions of apps available for Kindle Fire devices sooner and in greater quantity. Specifically, Spotify is ages old compared to the current versions available for iOS and Android, and more seriously crippling is the fact that the version Amazon offers does not support Spotify's new free-listening initiatives for mobile devices and tablets. Let's hope this improves soon.More to come...but again, this device at the price Amazon is asking is simply a no-brainer.

Baca \"happy mommy\"", "ReviewID": "RTV91WXMRQCC0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A Kindle was not even on my list of possible tablets to get. I was interested in the Samsung Note 8 (played with for a little bit at Best Buy). But Amazon offered me a 30-day free trial with a Kindle of my choice and I found that this was too tempting to pass up! Being an Amazon Prime member is awesome and it's truly the best way to get the full Kindle HDX experience! My 30-days are almost up and I plan on keeping my Kindle HDX. Here are my reasons why:1. MayDay. How awesome is this! I used this feature because I was having issues with one of my apps. The attendant came up as soon as soon as I pressed connect and was very patient and understanding while I was trying to explain my issue. Eventually I did have to get on the phone and speak with someone else but the attendant stay with me even while I was discussing my problem with the rep to make sure the rep understood what the issue was. This is by far the best thing about this device hands down!2. Amazon Prime. If you are a Prime member then you already know that you can get free movies and shows but if you have a Kindle device you can also get free books through the lending library (this was new to me!) and there are a tones of books to choose from. Going back to the movies and shows, I like that I have the option of downloading them onto my Kindle for travel (great feature for kids!) or going places where I know I won\u2019t have access to Wi-Fi.3. Shopping experience. I shop a lot through Amazon (which is why I am a Prime member) and this device just makes it incredibly easy to do just that. I think the Amazon coin option for purchasing apps is a great idea and have used them on a few apps for my kids.The only down sides of the Kindle for me are:1. There\u2019s no true YouTube app. I love YouTube and watch it pretty regularly. There are ones available in the kindle store but the best one I found so far (vTube?) doesn\u2019t quite function the same as the Google app on my iPhone. You have option of viewing YouTube through the Silk browser but a dedicated app that functioned more like (or better than!) the Google app would be ideal.2. You can\u2019t customize your home screen. You have this huge carousel thing at the top of the tablet\u2019s home screen and some (random?) apps that are at the bottom. I would like the option of at least customizing this screen since it\u2019s the first thing I see when the tablet unlocks.3. The ads are annoying. I wanted to see how I would respond to having the ads on the tablet to know if it was worth spending the extra $15 dollars to have them taken off. It is! It\u2019s annoying! My kids have seen some ads geared towards kids and ask for the stuff! We watch Netflix, Amazon, and ITunes content exclusively specifically to avoid advertisements and this has reminded me why we do! Pay the $15!For the price and all the extras you get with being a Prime member, keeping the Kindle HDX is a no brainer for me!", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love My Kindle Fire HDX", "Author": "Nicole", "ReviewID": "R1QROG7HWMRMLS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This came as a gift to upgrade me from the third generation Kindle and the Kindle app on my smartphone. When given the choice between this and the Paperwhite, I chose this one due to the ability to use as a regular tablet when I'm not reading.Pros:- The picture is absolutely stunning, especially when watching tv/movies. The picture is vibrant, clear, and sharp.- It's faster than I thought it would be, including powering up and down. Much better than the third gen Kindles.- I'm able to play games like Candy Crush Saga and Wheel of Fortune without any issues.- Can access Netflix, Hulu +, and other tv apps!Cons:-The battery doesn't last as long as I had hoped when playing games but it's still better than playing them on my tiny smartphone.- The weight of the Kindle, while lighter than previous generations can feel heavy after using it for a while. This isn't a huge \"con\" since there are those tablet pillows I can buy to alleviate the need for me to hold it while I watch shows or read.- Every now and then, especially when the brightness is turned all the way up, the screen vibrates which can cause dizziness. It only lasts for a moment at a time but it can get annoying when it does it more than once an hour. When I have the screen dimmed it doesn't appear to have that vibration problem.Overall, this is a fabulous buy, especially for those of us who were able to get a holiday deal on it. Even full price, it's worth it. The Nook was looking good simply because it has access to Google Play and Chrome whereas the Kindle only uses their own proprietary shop (Amazon App Store). But after reading reviews from experts and consumers it seems the Kindle is still the better tablet. Besides, the way Barnes and Noble is heading, they may not be around long enough to support the new Nooks into the future. At least Amazon seems strong and doesn't appear to be going anywhere anytime soon so the Kindle will be supported for years to come.I highly recommend this for anyone older than 10 years old.

The horsepower running this modified Android tablet makes all of the applications hum along.  The email client is business friendly out of the box...you can immediately set up email for Microsoft Exchange without having to get a third party application.  Wireless connects well and the tablet streams videos without a hitch.  I'm very excited to see how Amazon is going to take advantage of the Miracast technology built into the tablet.  I expect to see several adapters shortly that will allow you to use the Miracast functionality to \"throw\" your Kindle screen on to your TV so that you can use the TV to watch movies that are running on your Kindle.  Miracast has to take the place of the missing HDMI out port that was included in the last Kindle Fire tablet.  All in all, this tablet is a noticeable step up from the last generation.  It is a fully functional tablet, and with the \"side loading\" of applications from the Google Play store you can use this tablet for just about any Android application (although some games from Google Play must be connected to Google Play in order to function).By the way...I used the Mayday function to ask about a setting on the tablet.  I was very impressed by how quickly I was connected to a technical support agent, and how helpful the agent was in answering my question.  If you have any fear of using a tablet, the Mayday function is a welcome addition.  If you're buying the tablet for a technophobe, Mayday will be a great help to them if they have questions or problems.  This function is a quantum leap forward in customer service.

I am happy to say that I made the right decision! When my HDX arrived I was able to set it up with absolutely no problems. There were none of the difficulties with multiple reboots that I had heard about. Everything set up smoothly. Now, about that blue haze---on my HDX it is barely perceptible! It is there because I made a point of looking for it. But during normal use of the HDX I don't even notice it,and I use the regular white background for reading. I have found the Kindle HDX to be fast and it has a beautifully clear and sharp display. The only thing that was briefly a \"disappointment\" was the fact that one or two my most used apps were not available on the new HDX, however that has since been rectified and now everything works as it did on my Kindle Fire.

I was really looking for a smaller tablet that I could carry around in my purse  for email, calendar, facebook, internet etc. and the HDX has surpassed my expectations.  The lighter weight of this tablet is fantastic and feels great in my hands.  For the first time I have enjoyed reading books on the HDX, but still prefer my Kindle Paperwhite as my main reading device.  The display is gorgeous and I have enjoyed watching and listening (those little speakers sound awesome and an improvement over the original Fire) to missed episodes of my favorite shows.  I have to admit I was concerned that I wouldn't be able to retrieve my emails or google calendar after reading some of the reviews, but I didn't need to worry because it has worked great!  My kindle calendar, google calendar and the calendar app I use on my iphone have all synced beautifully and no matter what device I schedule on I know that all my devices are updated with the information.  I have had no issues with a flickering screen, WiFi connectivty etc. that I read in previous reviews.I love my Apple products and this is not a comparison between the ipad and Kindle.  I love my ipad, but it was to big and heavy to be transported and for a smaller tablet the Kindle HDX met my needs without breaking the bank (turned out to be bigger bargain with the $50 off deal on Cyber Monday).

The eink has no back light and it is strictly black and white.I had no problem copying all my books and documents from the old to the new using my computer.  I\u2019ve found that for just reading books the eink was a little easier to use was a lot lighter and the battery life was unbelievably long lasting almost a month between charges.  As for reading it takes a while to get use to the touch pad screen of the HDX and I find myself making a bookmark on every page which is a drag because if I fall asleep and the HDX drops I could be a hundred pages away or even on a different app when I sake up.  Yesterday morning I woke up to find I apparently bought the book I was reading when it had dropped from my grasp when I feel asleep.  Oh, this was easy to correct, so no harm done.  The only other negative things are its weight and battery life.  It feels twice as heavy as the eink and the battery life is poor at best, it has to be charged at least every day.Pros:The Mayday button is Great!  It didn\u2019t take me more than 15 minutes to get into trouble and rather trying to figure out what I had done wrong I pressed the Mayday button and had a person talking to me, explaining what was wrong and fixing the problem.  The app I was having a problem with this person had never seen before but yet stayed with me and helped me figure it out.  I had expected him to blow me off, after all how can he possibly know the intricacies if every 3rd party app, but he found a solution.  Kindle must be very proud of their Help Desk because it\u2019s one of the best around.  I\u2019ve had 2 other times I used Mayday and all the people that have helped found solutions, and were very courteous.Even though I love the eink reader for books the HDX overpowers with its apps and shear speed.  I find myself using the HDX to check Email, Contacts and my Calendar because it\u2019s faster than starting up my computer.  The Silk browser is 100 times better than the one on the eink.  The eink has only a handful of apps while the HDX is almost overwhelming with great apps.  The HDX has so much more to offer that I haven\u2019t gone back to my eink and never will.  Come on-- this thing plays music, videos, you can watch TV, browse the Internet, check your email, read newspapers and magazines, do work from the office and play games plus if you get into trouble there is someone at the press of a button that helps.

I have had ever version of it so far.  I love the screen....it is fantastic.  I like the layout.  I only see a bit of blue around the edges when I read a book, but it's really nothing terribly noticeable and it does not bother me any.  I like that it is thinner and lighter.  The only things I would change are:  I would have a HDMI port because that beats paying $50.00 for a converter to be able to watch movies on my TV.  I would not put the power button and volume buttons on the back, it's way to easy to touch them accidentally.  I like where they were before.  They were a bit less accessible before, but having a cover that put my kindle to sleep made it a mute point.  Also you can adjust the volume on-screen.  I would rather have the buttons where you can't touch them accidentally.  But none of these are game changers, it's still a better tablet than before even though I loved my Kindle HD also.  Hopefully Amazon will take these reviews to heart and use them when designing the next model.  It's a great value for the money!  I love it!  Update 1 month later:  I had problems with my first Kindle HDX, almost every time I changed it to Airplane mode off or on, it would turn off and then come back on to the home screen.  This was very annoying, so I returned it for another Kindle HDX.  The 2nd one had a blue spot on the screen that was like a small blue cloud that did not move and was there no matter what.  This changed the color of what I was watching or when reading, I could see it quite clearly.  I returned that Kindle also, because when you buy a brand new Kindle, it should work perfectly.  The 3rd Kindle that I got was REFURBISHED!!! The screen is fine, but guess what?  The airplane mode thing is happening with this one too, and guess what else - they will not take a refurbished Kindle back even though it was Amazon's mistake to send me one.  The offered me a partial refund instead, which I accepted, but I am not a happy camper.  A brand new product should not have these problems.  My Kindle HD never had any of these problems and still works just fine.  At this point I would really like to just return this Kindle HDX and wait until they work all of the bugs out of it and try buying it in about 6 months, but once again, they won't take it back for a refund.

I have to look for it to see it but it's very minor.  To be fair I do not read a lot on this, I use it for movies mostly, so I don't see the haze at all on anything but a stark white background.The buttons on the angled part of the rear are PERFECT for me.  Another thing that seemed to annoy others but it's a vast improvement from the way the buttons were hidden on the HD.  I had to hunt on my old HD for the buttons constantly and it was very frustrating.  The HDX buttons are concave so as to not push them by accident, the placement is perfect for easy use while holding the device.  I have never once turned it off by accident and I hold it from the back all the time.  I can see if you have a case that covers the back of the device that might block access to the buttons but this is not the fault of the Kindle, more of the case designer imo.The screen is beautiful, a definite step up from the HD when viewing them side by side.The audio quality is great with headphones and external speakers.  About the same as the HD.The battery lasts a LONG time (but also takes a while to charge up, even with the 9w charger)The speed of the device is excellent with the new quad core cpu.I had some issues with wifi dropping out from time to time but with the recent update to OS v3.1 that seems to be fixed.  fingers crossed.  I am very happy with the upgrade.  I got the 64G version (coming from the 16G HD) and it's so much nicer having all that space to download movies.  All in all, I was really on the fence about upgrading from the HD but am very happy I did.

I bought it primarily as a color reader. I have a Kindle Paperwhite that is about a year old. It was giving me some problems frequently freezing up, even after updating the software, though it would always restart successfully. Also, I use Kindle book loans and they can only be read on Kindle devices so the Kindle Cloud Reader apps for my laptop and smartphone can't be used. And, I knew from reading on my laptop that a color reader is desirable in some situations.The Kindle Fire is so much more than a reader. I was not looking for a full-function tablet, but the Kindle Fire has much more functionality than I expected. I brought in my email account, contacts and calendar, which is very convenient. The Silk browser quickly connects with the few sites that I use most: Amazon, NOAA weather, my public library, a couple of news accounts, for example. I still use my laptop for most web browsing and research but I think I could do more on the Kindle Fire if I wanted to. I've also downloaded a few games, which offer a nice bread from reading. While I don't normally watch Amazon Prime videos on my Fire, I did try it out. It loaded quickly, the picture was sharp, and the sound good.It works well for a reader, though the screen is a bit more reflective than the monochrome Kindles. It's very quick at loading books, page turning, and finding word definitions. A nice feature for word definitions is that it uses the source that it determines is most helpful - sometimes a dictionary and sometimes Wikipedia. Moving around in a book is very convenient thanks to a navigation menu that slides out from the left side of the screen.The battery life is good but playing games in particular will drain it. When reading a book I switch between my FIre and my Paperwhite to recharge the other and the syncing usually works well.In choosing between the HD and the HDX, I looked at both. The HD has a slower processor and that's very noticeable. The HDX screen image is clearer and sharper. For me there was no question that the HDX was worth the additional cost.The case and screen are very smooth, which I like. However, I was concerned that they could be scratched or otherwise damaged, even though I'm careful with my devices. I bought the rooCase slim shell origami case for it and am very pleased with it.

I expected to only use it as an e-reader, but it turned out to be one of our best electronic purchases ever.  That Kindle went with us to many interesting places over the years.  It's small enough to fit easily in a purse or a hotel safe, so it was our family's take-along device when traveling. With the reasonable price and small size, it was perfect for trips.  Free game apps keep the kids entertained on a rainy day of a beach vacation, not so expensive (compared to an iPad) that you worry about it being stolen when it's in the hotel room or broken while sneaking in one last roller coaster ride before heading to the Orlando airport.  The Acrobat Reader app allowed me to take hundreds of pages of work-related reading material with me to Europe without having the extra weight in my suitcase.  I read a lot, and my local library has thousands of books available to borrow for e-readers, a very nice supplement to the ones I've purchased for Kindle.  The untimely death of the previous Kindle was my fault: I dropped it, glass-side down, onto a ceramic tile floor and the glass shattered.  It's still working, but now in a plastic freezer bag so I don't get (more) glass shards in my fingertips.Now that I know what my Kindle needs are (50% reading, 50% apps and web surfing), I chose the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" as the replacement.  I  considered the iPad and iPad Mini, but this Kindle has more features and better resolution for a lower price.  I also looked at the larger Kindle Fire, but I really need my e-reader to fit in one hand, so the larger size is a disadvantage.  We own Apple products, so it's not like we avoid them, Kindle Fire HDX 7\" better suits my needs as an e-reader and tablet.Several things have been upgraded on this one compared to the earlier model.  My favorite is the ability to categorize books.  I have a pretty big library already on the cloud, still working on downloading and sorting through the books.  The screen resolution is better, not meaningful for reading but great in combination with Amazon Prime movies and apps.  I haven't had reason to use the camera yet, so no comments on that.  I also haven't tested the battery life on this one, but on the previous version I found that the battery lasted much longer when the wi-fi was turned off.I am very happy with this new Kindle.  The screen size allows great portability and it can be held in one hand, not too much bigger than a paperback.  Battery life is fine, screen resolution is beautiful  Available apps are great.  This time around I also purchased an Otterbox case, so I hope to not have another review to write anytime soon.", "Date": "April 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "KINDLE rocks.

The Dolby sound quality from the speakers is phenomenal for so small a device, but the volume level doesn't go very high and at its top volume it is only what I would consider as being barely satisfactory.  If there is any background noise at all you will have problems hearing it unless you are using earphones or a headset.  My biggest complaint about the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" is the location of the on/off button and the volume control. Both of these controls are under the sloped edge of the pad and if you have a leather cover for your Kindle Fire you pretty much have to remove it from the cover to access these controls.  I think the unit would be better if the control switches were on the edge like they had with the old B&W; 7\" Kindle with the keyboard.  I'm finding that to get a nice leather cover like want I am having to have one custom made.  One other item that I think would make the Kindle Fire HDX better would be a USB port that allows you to use a Flashdrive with it.  This would allow you to access movies and documents from an external source without having to use a computer to transfer them via a cable.  I have a lot of movies on DVD's that I wanted to view on my Kindle Fire HDX 7\" when I travel, I was able to find a program to convert them to MP4 format, but I discovered that when stored in the \"myflix\" folder on the Kindle I need to use the PHOTO selection on the Kindle to find them and not the movie selection, this is rather confusing especially since no instructions came with the Kindle.

Cook", "ReviewID": "R2XQWM0FEHYNPA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I ordered this Kindle as a Christmas gift for my spouse.  I usually do very thorough research before ordering online but I messed up on this one.  With all the hype about the HDX, I assumed it would include GPS.  My lowly ASUS has it so why wouldn't the much hyped HDX?  Otherwise, it has some nice features but I just have a hard time getting past this major shortcoming.  The video is very good, audio is better than on the ASUS but I prefer headphones to the built in speakers on any tablet.  Processing speed is pretty good but perhaps the most impressive feature is the \"Mayday\" live help.  I've only needed it a couple of times but when you need it, it's there and I was very impressed with the quick response time and the knowledge of the operator.Not a big deal to me but another standard feature on my ASUS Transformer that's missing here is an HDMI connection.  It does have Bluetooth. Wireless is a little stronger than the ASUS. This tablet also lacks a memory card slot and a rear facing camera, both of which are included on the ASUS Transformer.Other than the lack of GPS, the most irksome thing is that you're pretty much locked into Amazon for content.  Many things I would get for free on Google are not free or not available on Amazon. Oh, and did I mention, unless you get the more expensive 4G version, THIS UNIT DOES NOT HAVE GPS?!  GRRRR!  The ASUS GPS works without a wireless connection as long as you load your maps and select your route while connected to a network and keep the tablet powered up.  Even if you have the 4G version of the HDX, I would not assume that GPS will work without a 4G connection.  Otherwise, why would GPS only be available with 4G?Revision 3/27/14: The Bluetooth is picky about what it will pair with. Can't connect with my Samsung mobile headset. It is also extremely picky about wired headphone jacks. Some work sporadically but many don't work at all. Some only get mono even though they give me stereo with other devices (like my computer or my ASUS tablet). So far the only headset I've found that works reliably and really well is a (fairly pricey) Sony Walkman in-ear headset with headband.  I've also had my first poor experience with Mayday since I first posted my review. It took a very long time to finally be told that the tablet is not compatible with my Samsung Bluetooth headset. To sum up, I don't doubt this device is very good for reading books but that's not what I bought it for. It's pretty adequate for web browsing but lacks several features that are standard on many if not most Android tablets, many of which are less expensive. If I had it to do over I'd probably opt for the smaller (less expensive) companion to my ASUS Transformer.", "Date": "March 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "great buy for anyone", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3CA70OZ41J0W5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Awesome holds a great charge for battery easy and simple to use anyone can use it lightweight and fun great buy", "Date": "March 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1ODI2KL0Q7YAJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What can I say about this device.

First, it doesn't give one the entire 64 gb. This is normal as formatted memory systems go, but where the misleading part comes in is that these also use storage memory for operating memory. Thus, when I downloaded so much that I only had 4 or 5 gb left, the device froze up and took forever to play streaming videos and execute files. This means that you don't get the entire memory block for storage, but that you must reserve a considerable amount of it just to operate the bloody thing!When it first began to bog down, I asked the Mayday people for assistance. They led me through a litany of things which did no good. Then when they suggested resetting the device, I asked if it would remove any of my content. No, absolutely not, they said. So I reset the device and the movies began streaming without a hitch. Great! Only when I went to my on device video library, everything I'd downloaded was gone -- almost 50 gigs of data! So I downloaded everything again and now my system barely moves.The video experts told me I should be able to fill my entire storage, but this isn't apparently true. Thus, when you buy a quality Android device that has 8- or 16-gb of memory with a storage of up to 64 gbs with an SD card,  you're getting a better system memory-wise. As far as the video help, out of five calls, three were with people who spoke such poor English that communication was all but impossible. If I'd had a heart attack while on the phone with them and needed their help, I'd be dead.If this device had an SD slot, this thing would get a raging 5-star review. But tech support is wanting, my memory is only about two-thirds of what I was expecting, and this thing isn't that fast. It requires a lot of memory, and that memory comes from the storage, regardless of what I'd been told. You may want to skip this until Amazon gives truthful specifications.

Kindle is really a ease way to move around and learn.I owned a Nexxxus tablet before, gave it to my husband. It felt less personal.Kindle and connection with Amazon.com. I feel connected and great support.Sadly within 4 weeks my Kindle HDX just quit . Didn't turn on anymore. Amazon.com Kindle support was very helpful.Via phone they tried to boost it or whatever they did. But it did not work. So we agreed that I needed to ship it back.Here is where it becomes a bit odd.I told them I do not want a refurbished one. I paid for a new one and would like to have a new one.Though the agent agreed with me and assured me, when the replacement arrived, it said right on the box, refurbished one.Wow. But Amazon.com always is willing to work things out. Unfortunately in this case, the only thing that was left to do was to return the broken one, the replacement one and now order a brand new one.Apparently they are not sending out new ones to replace one.I will keep an eye on the sales. Hopefully I can purchase one soon.Love the HDX, love the service via amazon.com, but don't get that I can't get a new one as a replacement since I paid for a new one and it was only 4 weeks later that I had a problem.", "Date": "March 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "love it", "Author": "Renee L Browell", "ReviewID": "R1MCY0RYIOVX42", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I can do just about everything on this and I absolutely love it.

Some of these devices I use as Amazon intended; others are modified to suit specific needs/interests. From a hardware perspective the HDX is outstanding and an attractive alternative to the Nexus 7 if you don't need GPS, NFC or wireless charging. On smaller tablets I prefer the Kindle form factor as I find it easer to hold in any orientation without worrying about accidental screen touches/activations. When purchased I assumed root access and perhaps an alternative ROM would eventually be needed. Turns out a different launcher (Apex or Nova) and a few side loaded apps from 1Mobile were all that was required. Didn't even need to root my HDX which technically voids Amazon's warranty. The \"Mojito\" operating environment is more flexible than earlier Amazon/Fire ROMs; most Android apps run perfectly with exception to the Play store (admittedly a biggie) and some Google creations. I can live without those. And I still have easy access to Prime movies and a few native Amazon apps that I happen to prefer. With minimal time and effort my HDX makes an excellent Android tablet that still leverages the best Amazon has to offer.", "Date": "February 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Product.", "Author": "exmptle", "ReviewID": "R1SEUURZHE3PB2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I took this on a trip recently.

I have to say I love it. My wife was able to try out the 8.9\" KF HDX and while the movies were beautiful on it the size was not for me since I read a lot, so I got the 7\"Screen = sexySound = It's a mobile device so I dont expect anything spectacular, that is where ear buds or headphones come into playCPU = Speedy little thing, quite impressedBuild Quality = SolidBattery Life = Great but like everyone else I want longer! :)Storage = 64GB and am happy Amazon offers this size and would love to see a 128GB or 256GB model in the future.OS = meh...... Read about it below.Bluetooth = WinWiFi = stable and solid I am an Android user and I like stock Android. I understand Amazon is trying to make it usable for anyone of any age sort of deal, but my biggest gripe is the freaking carousel (please fire the person/s responsible for this decision!!!) Please make a way to customize or just flat our disable for your customers that cant stand it. Second is the silk browser... I mean really come on! Why not use the default browser or Chrome that is part of Android, they are decent and average browsers that dont have issues with 60% of websites when loading them or hanging on the other 40% at random times. I just use Firefox Mobile to resolve this issue. Third and this is more of a personal issue that pops up from time to time since I got the Kindle Fire HDX and that is the seemingly constant need to be connected to the internet. When I am at home not a problem, when I am on the road really not a problem as I can use a hotspot (but do I really need to?), when I am at work that is really impossible as I have to keep it in airplane mode if I want to even bring it with me. This poses an issue sometimes when it needs to verify licensing to run some apps or play some games during lunch or waiting for code to compile, to watch a movie I downloaded from Amazon VOD so I could watch it while away from a data connection or a limited data connection in terms of data amount I can use. This needs to be resolved with all digital content that is usable on the KF HDX. I dont really have this issue when I use my Nexus 7 unless the app/game I am trying to run requires an internet connection for it to actually function due to the nature of the app/game.OK now that I got my negative out of the way lets add a few more good things to this rating.The app/game selection is pretty darn good, the game circle is cool but Amazon and Google need to make a love connection here with games that support G+ syncing so I can keep my saves of Reaper on my Android devices and KF HDX device. Don't think I need to play two separate games due to that (or at least make a way to export/import gave saves between the platforms). Digital content in terms of movies/shows and also music is great. I buy 99% of my content from Amazon as I can play the music on any platform and then stream video content to any platform. Then with the purchase of BR/DVD/Digital from the store if I cant add it to my Amazon digital library, then the support of flixster and such is available.I love reading books on this device, I have a ton of book I have purchased through Amazon and then ones I have as PDF from technical books I can send using the kindle address or side loading it. The good reads inclusion of the app is not as robust as the Android version or the website but it will do and it does let you see some other books based off of comments, ratings, and similar interest when you are looking for something a little outside your normal scope.Hope this helps other customers!", "Date": "February 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "A Got To Get", "Author": "Jeanne Klohr", "ReviewID": "R3TED0Z4OJJRG5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I wanted the HDX, I thought I would get the 8.9 display.

I did a LOT of research before I made my purchase and decided that this Kindle was the best fit for me. I was not disappointed!There are a few drawbacks:1. No SD card slot so on-board memory is all you get. This isn't a problem for me, since I don't have a whole lot of apps and cloud storage is available. (LOVE the cloud storage!!)2. Google apps are not supported. Reportedly people have gotten them to work on their Kindle but I wasn't able to get them going. I adapted - I get my Gmail via browser and use an alternate mapping app.3. Battery life isn't quite what I'd like, but manageable.Now for the pros:1. The size and weight is just right. It is comfortable to use - even hours on end like I do2. Clear, sharp images. I was quite impressed by how good things look on the Kindle Fire3. Cloud storage so if you get overloaded with apps or books, you can save them to the cloud for later retrieval4. A wide variety of apps will run on the Kindle Fire, ranging from games to Office apps.Once I got the Kindle Fire, I realized that I'd underestimated how much I'd use it. I not only use it for reading (which I do a lot!), but I also have Skype on it, several games, and a bunch of work-related applications. I use it to do some work-related tasks when it's not convenient to be at my computer. With the apps I've collected, I can do all of my work - even work that requires VPN -  on the Kindle - it's that good!I'll admit that the Kindle Fire is not for everyone. If you are expecting a full-blown tablet, you may not like this. It's total overkill if all you want to do is read books. If you absolutely MUST have the SD card slot or MUST run Google apps, then you should look elsewhere. However, if you are looking to read books and also watch movies or tv, play a few games, and run a few apps, then the Kindle Fire is an excellent choice.", "Date": "February 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "awesome!!!", "Author": "shannon", "ReviewID": "R2GS8O4UYL1GLD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just got it today and I love it!

She likes her Paperwhite Kindle very much, but when I had one, I did not care for it.  I borrowed my Granddaughter's first generation Kindle Fire and liked it, so bought a first generation Kindle Fire HD.  I liked the concept, but had so much trouble with failures with them (I had and sent back 3 of them), that I got to know the tech support people pretty well.  I kept the last Fire HD I had since it semi-worked.  Finally, however, with much trepidation (and a $50 one day price drop) I purchased the new Kindle Fire HDX.  It has proven perfect.  It has not crashed nor given me blank pages or any of the myriad problems I had with my Fire HDs.I had read of complaints with blue/purple borders on the HDX, but I did not see it with mine.  My wife said she saw a faint blue tinge at the edges, but it was not bothersome.  I use my HDX almost exclusively for reading and I prefer the black background with white printing so blue/purple borders are not an issue anyhow.I think if you have been disappointed with the first generation Fire HD you will be pleased with the HDX, at least as an E-reader.", "Date": "January 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "i love it", "Author": "Melissa Kay Krause", "ReviewID": "R15G94MN9Y8O2Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is great.

Purchased Google Nexus 7 Second Generation. Returned it  Purchased Samsung Note 8 for an amazing $225 from Staples because of coupons and store discounts. No rebates to wait for. It was an incredible deal. Returned it. Purchased apple mini with retina display for $399. Returned it. Purchased Kiindle Fire HDX 8.9. returned it.The HDX \"7\" and HDX \"8.9\" are both amazing. I settled on the \"7\" because I bought it from BEST BUY for $239. The HDX \"8.9\" was $429 for the 32 gig unit. Four things. The Display color is awesome! The display screen resolution is incredibly sharp and the \"READING VIEW\" is a true joy when I'm reading digital media such as CNN and MSN. ( Reading View feature is only available on certain websites so  it's not on all the websites I browse but it's a fantastic feature to have!!) The audio is wonderful. I also am very impressed with the \"MAYDAY\" feature which connects you with a live technical advisor in 15 seconds by simply clicking on \"MAYDAY\".

All have been a pleasurable experience, but this HDX has exceeded all my expectations by far!  I was reluctant to get it as I only expected a software update and a few added gizmos.  I had hoped they would include another camera on it too, but no.What pushed me over the edge in purchasing it was a $50 coupon sent to me as a Prime customer, plus the knowledge I could sell my older HD Fire and recoup even more of the purchase price so it seemed to be worth a major software upgrade, all by itself.WOW!  Holy computational power, Batman!!!  I am more than delighted with this 7\" HDX!  The total difference between the older Fire HD generation one and this Fire HDX is amazing!  Incredible value here!  My only regret is that it doesn't support Flash, but neither did the HD unless you sideloaded Dolphin, and for the most part I can do without having Flash on it.  I do hope a software upgrade will enable Flash videos on it, and soon, but with the outstanding performance and speed of the HDX as it is, I can live without having Flash.  Besides, what a lot of people don't realize is, if you use any other OS (in order to view Flash) rather than the Amazon version, you lose all the great benefits of Amazon's cloud loading and storage, which is part of the reason for it's speed and super flexibility.This HDX is a true world-beater.  I can't imagine what even newer models could provide in addition except another camera on the 7\" model.  I have not used the Mayday help feature, but since I've used Fires from the very beginning I'm used to handling the OS.

This is one of the highest quality tablets I have ever used.  I argue that this is just as nice as my mother's iPad.  The device is fast.  The OS has major improvements.  That was always my issue with past kindle fires.  The OS was slow and buggy and the browser was awful and you couldn't organize apps very well.This is all changed.  You can organize apps beautifully.  The amazon app store finally has enough apps where I am satisfied (even though it is still lower than google play and the apple app store, it has everything I need).  The silk browser is awesome on this device.  Even if I had the opportunity, I wouldn't switch to another browser.I have not used the mayday button because I am pretty tech savvy, but I am considering getting my grandfather one solely for this reason.If you have any doubts about purchasing this, do it.

I can hold it in one hand with ease all day.The battery is not as good as past kindle fires, but I can't complain because of the performance increase.  I can still get a full days use out of it as long as I am not constantly watching videos.

We also have 2 iPad Air's and an iPad mini.  The Kindle Fire HDX was purchased as a Christmas gift to myself as my 4 year old daughter was hogging her grandmother's Kindle (and mine).  So it was purchased with the thought that I would use it (primarily to read library ebooks, check email and facebook, and play some games).After about 2 weeks of use I was contemplating returning it as we really weren't using it to warrant the purchase, and we discovered that we would soon have access to 2 more iPads (the Airs).Then I realized that FreeTime wasn't just a thing to restrict access, that for only $2.99 (Prime members) a month my daughter would have access to a lot of her favorite apps and tons and tons of great books and videos.  Content is added frequently, which is a huge concern for me.  One of our biggest struggles was that my daughter constantly wants me to download her new games, often minutes after downloading something.  FreeTime completely eliminates that, which is amazing!!I still wish many things available for the iPad were available on the Kindle and I still use the iPad more when browsing the Internet or playing games on the Internet.

The color screen is crisp and, as a color screen, is more suitable for technical volumes than the B&W; Kindles.

The mail app is also good enough for casual use.I don't watch videos on the Kindle so I can't comment on the performance at that task. I have watched some video tutorials using the browser and that worked well.In all, if you accept that the Kindle is a media consumption device with hooks into and dependencies upon the Amazon ecosystem and if that is why you bought it you will be very happy.

I had not tried connecting in other environments other than in my home where I have high sped internet through a cable company. Thus, I ran into the very same connectivity issues that I had with my old Kindle. This was very disappointing as I had been reassured by the Amazon chat tech that the connectivity problems had been significantly improved (in the HDX 7'). For this reason, I made the decision not to order the 4G internet (Verizon) with it and ordered solely the WIFI connection for it. I am returning the device in the morning.

My family has owned the original Kindle Fire the past two years roughly, and this one is way above that version.  Is it better than the Kindle Fire HD version?  Depends, but probably not if price is your biggest factor.Pros:1) iPad Contender - Seriously.  The iPad in my opinion is way overpriced for what it does.  The Kindle Fire HDX is just as capable at handling most of the same work flow with a couple of differences.  Yes, this is tied to the Amazon App store.  If Google Play was standard, then Apple might be worried.  Right now though, Amazon is crippling their own success.2) Fluid Performance - Smooth as butter.  I have played around with everything available for the past two months and it handles it all with excellence.  Games, work, reading, etc run flawlessly (app issues not withstanding).3) Screen - Sharpest resolution I have ever seen on a screen this size.  Made the original Kindle Fire look like a 10 year old non-HD television.  I could stare at this thing for days (but won't).  Reading, movies, games, etc are shown in perfect HD resolution.NOTE - The blue pixel edge issue is there, but it is not distracting to me.  I actually kind of like it.  If you read a lot on white backgrounds, then it pops out more than normal.  The haze falls to the background after I begin reading the first page of something, and I never notice it much any more.4) Micro USB Connector - Bite it Apple!  :)  No cord carousal here.  If you have a cord sitting around, it most likely works for charging or connecting the Kindle Fire HDX.  For the first time ever - a plug adapter is included!  Amazon is including a plug adapter so you can actually charge the device through a regular electrical outlet.  What a concept Amazon!  That might catch on with other electronics (sarcasm).5) Bells and Whistles - This thing has it all (mostly).  Dual-band WiFi, HD screen, Amazon support (best in the world), light as a feather, etc, etc.Cons:1) Amazon App Store (sort of) - No Google Play?  I know Amazon wants everyone to use the device for their content, but not allowing one of the largest app stores on your Android device seems illogical.  I am able to use 3rd-party app stores to upload missing apps and outdated ones on the Amazon App Store, but still!2) USB Connection Port - The connection port on the device can be a bit of a nuisance.  You have to connect it at an angle on the device (around 30 degrees).  Just irritating to me for some reason as everything else has it straight, so your mileage may vary.3) Mayday Button Gimmick - I am a computer-savvy person.  I don't need help on where to press the power button or tweak the brightness.  If you are buying this for grandma or a person that never has used much technology in the past 10 years, then this is a life saver for you (no more annoying phone calls).4) Battery - I get a couple days of heavy usage (8 hours) out of it.  I just wish I could get the Kindle reader battery life of 4 to 8 weeks.  :)Overall:This is finally the Kindle to put Amazon in striking range of Apple on the tablet front.  If you crave everything Amazon like me, then it is a no brainer to purchase this.  If you are not, then buy it anyway as you will save at least $100 over the nearest priced iPad.  If Amazon would just switch to Google Play for the app store, then there is nothing that would stop them from ruling the world!  :)", "Date": "January 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire HDX 7\"", "Author": "Melissa", "ReviewID": "R22FZPHTPJ6OYK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "New owned a Kindle or a Tablet and got this for Christmas and I love it!

I think we have to put all these tablets in perspective. I also have a 8.9\" Nook HD+. So, much as been said about the Kindle that I had to buy one to see for myself is it all that it is said to be. I like the Kindle because of its size and portability. One of the main reasons that I can really enjoy my Kindle is because it has been rooted. This means that not only do I have access to Amazon content, I also have access to the Google PlayStore. This is important to me in order to be able to enjoy ownership of a Kindle.With it being rooted I can enjoy both worlds. The Kindle is a fantastic tablet, but in my opinion only if it is rooted. I don't like proprietary software and if you keep it with Amazon's offers, ecosystem it gets really boring quick. I am a Prime and Netflix member, so this tablet is great. I am able to fit it inside my purse and travel with it with no problem. However, the only reason I can enjoy it to this point is because it is rooted. It is a beautiful tablet and I really like everything it can do.Pros: affordability, portability, fast and efficient software (speedy), beautiful display resolution, versatile (if able to root), impressive device (makes me want the 8.9\" just can't justify the purchase since I have a Nook of the same size)Cons: no way to expand memory, no HDMI ouptput, proprietary software, having to pay to stop special offers", "Date": "January 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "I LOVE it!!", "Author": "Barbie", "ReviewID": "R13C13DT45WADG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Beautiful display, lightweight, no problems with using it immediately.

The battery is more than satisfactory and I have found it to last most of the day and part of the night. Email gives me some trouble and I learned quickly to check it before hitting send. You wouldn't believe what I sent to someone. It is a good candidate for \"Damn you autocorrect\". We had a good laugh about it, though. At any rate, I recommend the HDX.

I also have saved pdf docs of patterns and tutorials on it. My HDX works beautifully, in the standing case, on my jewelers bench for various metalworking guides and for offline use.In my kitchen, the HDX is  a recipe book,  with recipes from the internet via wifi as well as files saved offline.Basic Pros -- The images & sounds are  crisp and clear,  which is a significant improvement over the original Kindle Fire.- Easy to use & navigate for the slightly less tech savvy (I'm an art geek not a techno geek and comfortable with Apple products.)- Kid friendly, my 2 yr old niece and 8 yr old nephew enjoyed an interactive story on it as well as the usual kid games and apps.- A lot (1000's) of free Kindle books, lower priced reads, samples, and the Prime lending library for a monthly freebie.Basic Cons --My 64gb 7\" model doesn't  have  a rear facing camera but it's not enough of a con to knock a star off. I use a DSLR for my art pics and my iPhone 5s for my out-and-about snapshots, so using the HDX for an occasional selfie or web chat is  great.-The battery life isn't as good as it was on the old original Kindle Fire. Since this version does a lot more, it makes sense, and because I charge it daily.  I don't have issues with it dying on me in the middle of activity.- Overall this Amazon addict is pleased! -My  new lightweight Kindle goes everywhere with me.

This is not my first kindle (or second, or...). This tablet is definitely an improvement over the previous versions, it's more responsive, it handles video and web browsing so much better than the previous Fire generation, and I love the slimmed down version.The overall design is an improvement. The video quality is great, and music does play with a decent quality. Love the feature where it can display lyrics while playing song (if the mp3 has the information), thanks to the whole X-Ray/Lyrics feature. There's a lot of new touches here that are fun. I really appreciate the volume and the power buttons being on the opposite sides of the kindle now (don't know how many times I've hit the wrong one on my Fire >.<).Also, being able to have more than two browsers open on Silk now w/out it crashing all of the time is a great improvement.Some minor quirks - not sure if it's me or the tablet, but still trying to figure out how to get pictures already taken from my phone onto the tablet and directly into the photo folder.Have installed several apps without a problem, downloaded files and opened them, so far so good. The kindle goes everywhere with me (literally, it's the perfect size to fit in my purse). I wish there were more cover options for the 7\", but it seems to be increasing the longer the kindle is out, and I think a cover/case is a must for one of these. This is the kindle that I do take everywhere, and on a recent trip, I used this more than my Surface as it has my most frequently used personal emails installed on it (easy to set up), I can access my social accounts, my music, and of course my books.The battery is... eh, decent. I can keep it on and play music for a few hours, video less, and use it to read books for most of a day.

I haven't owned a tablet before but I've played around on other's iPads. I feel like this tablet is very comparable to an iPad but at almost half the cost, I would pick the Kindle every time. I chose the 7\" instead of the 8.9\" because I like the smaller tablet and I personally would never hold up something so big to take a picture, especially when I have my phone or digital camera.Cons:- There is a blue/purple haze around the border of the screen that is visible on white. It actually doesn't bother me at all but it does bother some people. I don't even notice it's there unless I specifically pay attention to it. Even though it doesn't bother me, I would rather it not be there.- Battery life isn't great compared to the iPad. For the same amount of use, I'm used to charging every 2 weeks or so instead of every 3-4 days.- I don't like that the charger is plugged in at an angle instead of straight on. It's not really THAT big of an issue but it does take more effort than usual to plug it in.- This is more my fault for not reading/understanding the Prime benefits, but you only get the benefits of Prime if your account pays for it, not when you get added and another account pays for it (which completely makes sense). I was really looking forward to \"borrowing\" Kindle books for free and downloading movies to watch later offline but my husband wanted to keep paying for prime on his account and I didn't want to put my Kindle under his account or have both of us pay for Prime.Overall, I love my Kindle and it's a great tablet for the price.

The Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" was  a Christmas present to myself, and it was a great price to boot.  I found the setup to be ridiculously simple (already having an amazon account and another kindle), but I think that even first time owners will be pleased.  The videos on HD are very crisp (using a high speed router and Xfinity), and optional \"Amazon Prime\" for $79 a year provides the owner not only with free 2 day shipping on all \"Prime\" items purchased, but thousands of movies and shows are included.  There are a good number of \"apps\" available (many are free), and hundreds of free games.  For the price, this tablet certainly provides a quality interface with the internet and is more convenient that sitting at a desk or carrying a laptop.  I have also found many books and guides (borrow from Prime or purchase) that will help users to get the most out of their Kindle.  If you love videos or reading, playing games, \"Skyping\", or even phone calls (yes, there is a way to do that), I believe that you love this tablet.  Your only decision is whether to spend more for the \"HDX\" version, which adds capacity and speed, or for additional memory.

In fact, on the Kindle Fire HDX website under the \"Kindle for Kids\" section it states \" Parents can create a profile for each of their children and choose what books, apps, games, and videos they want to give their kids access to.\"  This sounded great and exactly what I wanted for a media device for the kids.  However, upon setting the new Kindle up I found that the maximum number of accounts possible is 4.

I own a kindle keyboard so this is a huge upgrade for me. I am a huge fan of amazon and I did plenty of research on this product before even though I knew I would love it. I am a huge fan of the kindle. For those of you that post bad ratings due to lack of apps or other stupid things is your own fault for not researching this product first. This product is a KINDLE. This is not an ipad or other kind of tablet. For a kindle this is a very good tablet. The kindle was originally made to read books and even though now it is more centered around internet usage, it is still for reading. No you will not find the same features and capabilities on this kindle as you will on another higher level tablet. For the price paid for this kindle it is truly worth it. The color is beautiful and the processor is very responsive and clear. It really is a great upgrade for the kindle. It may not be up to the same level as an ipad but for the price and the fact that it's a kindle makes it amazing. This product is for amazon lovers and those who are dedicated to amazon. I have a prime membership and I have already tested out some of the videos which are great. I also love the sound and how the volume buttons are on the back. I understand that some of you actually have received a defective tablet and that would be a good reason to give it a low rating but it is a new piece of technology so there are going to be some defective ones. As far as the blue or purple hue when reading that everyone pointed out goes, I don't know if it is different on different kindles but mine is very faint and I can hardly notice it. It is definitely not a big deal. There are too many people comparing the kindle to an ipad. No it will not have all the same apps because kindle has its own browser called silk. There however is still a lot of apps available and I assume the popular ones wouldn't be hard to find. There is also a way to sideload apps and all it takes is some research on youtube to figure out how. I am very impressed with this kindle and I understand its greatness. For those of you that hated it because you did not do your research, you should be looking in to this stuff before you buy it. Again, the kindle is for amazon lovers and those who mainly enjoy reading and surfing the web. For those of you that simply play games and want a ton of apps, a different tablet would probably be better for you. I can't wait to learn more about my kindle and experience the other great things that are yet to come.

It works amazingly well for me,  It was worth the upgrade all by itself. I spent in excess of $100.00 for a program for my PC, and have been disappointed with it. It is difficult to use, requiring many key strokes to get it going, not to mention the necessary use of a headset. The Kindle is very accurate in getting down what I say, not 100% yet, but closer than I can do with my fingers on the PC. Now, all I have to do is learn to speak in commas and periods.

The only thing i noticed as something it lacked was harddrive space when the Amazon prime video offered to download the movie better quality would require more harddrive space.

But it's a great E reader.I wanted a good 7 inch tablet.  I bought a returned the Google Nexus 7.  It was great except for no browser having a reading pane which is important in a small tablet.  You would think Google would have this in Chrome but no.  The screen is the best in class.I went to Best Buy and they had the HD and HDX side by side.  I compared the internet and there was no comparison - they HDX was very fast so I bought it to try out.  Happy to report that this is now a true tablet in that the Silk browser is much improved,, the quad core makes all the difference, the internet is now very usable and fast.HDX also has improvements over the HD - you can slide up from the bottom to access recently used programs which is very important if you need to switch between apps since only Surface allows you to keep two apps open simultaneously in the tablet world.  This works better than iPad.A page from other androids - you swipe down to see email and other notifications.The power button is now accessible!Size is smaller and slimmer.Some have noticed that there is a purple haze to the background.  That's true and that's something you have to judge for yourself if it bothers you.There is a limit on the number of tabs you can open on the Silk browser.Battery life is improved over HD.  It now comes with a cable and wall charger.There is no rear camera.  If that's important to you, consider the iPad Mini.  OR you can buy a real camera for the price difference.In summary, there is really no reason to buy the HD unless the price is $100.  The HDX is now a good competitive tablet.  The app store remains a problem if you depend on apps for games.  I have found some surprisingly good specialty apps.This is smaller than the iPad Mini and almost half the price.

Since this tablet cannot yet be purchased in The Netherlands in a store, this was the only chance for me to pick it up and feel and explore it. I loved the design, the feel, the incredible clarity and mega-fast processor.Back home, I tested a lot of tablets at a Dutch local megastore. Google Nexus seemed appealing, then Samsung tab 3.0, but I disliked the shapes, too long/narrow screen proportions. LG Gpad 8.3 was another temptation, but again: that weird long narrow screen? I jumped on to Apple's Ipad Mini 2. Bigger screen than the average 7\" and just perfectly proportioned. Simply not being an Apple's type of guy, I hesitated. What held me back at Ipad Mini 2, were the limitations of dropping audio and video files on it. You would have to use Itunes for almost everything and convert many movie files.With Kindle, I wasn't sure about its Amazon-tunnel-vision strategy. But I also read there were a lot of ways to sideload apps outside the Amazon app-convent.From the day I received it (3 days after purchase, this gets UPS delivered to your doorstep and yes, they do ask your neighbours to receive it on your behalf in case you're not at home), I have not regretted this purchase for one second.I like Amazon products a lot. I do read Kindle books. But I like Kobo also. No problem, on youtube there's a perfectly clear instruction video on how to bring Kobo to your Kindle, and the two do peacefully co-exist.Magazines: lovely, cheap and easy to order, a delight to page through on this tablet.PDF files, Word documents: perfect viewing.For more extensive typing, I purchased the Perixx Periboard-805L, which works like a charm as a bluetooth wireless foldable keyboard for my Kindle tablet.Kindle Fire HDX 7 had my first attention, and remained my ultimate choice.

I'm coming from an Apple ecosystem. I have Apple everything. This is my first non Apple purchase. I really love the iPad but the market has changes since I bought the original version. There are way more options. The Kindle was a fraction of the cost of the ne iPad mini retina. The screen is gorgeous. I find it the perfect size for watching movies in the hand. Amazon makes it very easy to move your music over to the Amazon ecosystem from Apple if you want to do that. For 20ish bucks a year you can move all your apple music to the cloud at Amazon. From there you can download whatever songs you want to your Kindle or just play them from the cloud. Very easy.I was initially worried about not having access to the full Android spectrum of apps. It hasn't proven to be an issue at all. It took me about 10 minutes to sidestep the Amazon store and install Chrome and Firefox. I was also able to install a flash player and can now run any flash web apps through the Dolphin web browser. I couldn't do this on my iPad.The touchscreen is very snappy with no lag at all. This processor is speedy.A big upgrade from my iPad 1. The built in speakers are also better than my iPad 1. I didn't know if I would be OK with the smaller screen bit I'm enjoying it quite a bit. The more convenient size has be taking the kindle with me more than I ever did with the iPad. The iPad was really just too big to lug around.

But before I get to what drags the score down for me, the good stuff about the Kindle Fire HDX:- Clearly more than a reader.  The hardware in this is powerful and easily high up comparative to other tablet-like device of this size.- Battery life is great so far.- Fantastic screen quality; reading, browsing the internet, using apps like netflix, tumblr, etc., all look fantastic- Sound is also very good, headphones and speakers both- Ads are very unobtrusive (if applicable to your kindle), only appearing on the unlock screen.- Like advertised, works straight out of the box (obviously if you have linked a previously existing amazon account to the kindle)- Big name apps from the amazon store work perfectly. Netflix, Tumblr, Pintrest, Pandora, Skype, Steam, Sonos, BBC, NPR, Twitch are some that I had no trouble quickly installing and using. The email integration is great, and the goodreads integration is absolutely fantastic.- Most of the settings and features are very intuitive, and when using for the first time there will typically be very basic, quick tutorials.- A great deal for the price.- If you own Amazon content in their cloud its a matter of seconds to access it. And if you have Prime, the kindle is a no-brainer.All in all a great device. However there are a number of limiting factors and mild annoyances that build up to a loss of a star for me. The good news is that many of these can be fixed; the question is whether they might actually be fixed. Here's my problems with the device:- Apps are solely from the Amazon Kindle App store. This is useful in some ways, as you can control apps from your amazon account remotely, but also limiting in others. Compared to the Google Play store the selection is lacking. Although it should be mentioned that this may be partially be design, since there are many apps that do not work (yet) on this kindle's version of android.  Even so, apps can be side-loaded onto the device if you have basic technical know-how. For example, the Humble Bundle App works perfectly on my kindle. To be fair a lot of apps are pretty much crap, but I'd like to have the options for more, albeit mixed with some quality control.- App permissions can sometimes be downright creepy, i.e. a stupid game or simple app having access to data  that it clearly does not need to function and you would rather keep personal. I understand that this is not strictly Amazon's responsibility but rather that of the third-party developers and the owner of the kindle, but its worth mentioning here.- The placement of the only physical buttons, the power and volume buttons, isn't as intuitive as I would like. I find myself accidentally pressing the wrong ones from time to time. I suppose that I might just have to get used to them though.- I would've liked the option for a mircoSD slot, but I guess we live in the age of the ~cloud~. The 16 GB isn't really 16 GB, which is par for the course. But its even less than you might think, you only get 10.6 GB. Unless all your content is on or going to be on your amazon account, spring for the 32 or 64 GB model.- The 7\u201d version only has a camera facing you; no camera facing outwards.  Not really super important unless you want it.- The Carousel is plain stupid. This is a function that works well on other multi-touch devices, but on this kindle it just plain doesn't work well. The intended function is to quickly pick up what you had been doing previously, and for reading books this is still useful. However for everything else it isn't very. In particular if you load up things (like drm-free books via usb) they ALL appear as new on the Carousel, and you can only remove them one at a time. If there was someway to customize it, like so that everything new did not appear and you could lock in which apps you wanted to appear on it, then it might be functional, but as it is I ignore it completely unless I want to get back to the last book I was reading.- Some options for organizing books would be helpful rather than just sort by title/author/recent and displaying covers. An option for alphabetized letter sections would be nice, as well as some indication of a scroll bar to the right hand side.- One of the first things I did in my settings was turn off letting things automatically detect where I am located. I have wi-fi only, and I don't really need it on, plus nearly everything asks for it which just kind of creeps me out. But, and this is the most annoying thing, every single time an app or website requests it I get a pop-up asking me if I want to enable location-based services. Let me repeat this: Every. Single. Time. And a lot of apps will consistently ask. So at least once every 5-20 minutes, depending on what I'm using, I will be interrupted by this pop-up asking me this question even though the answer is pretty much always no. Which I thought was, you know, the point of me disabling it in the settings to begin with.

I would download these anyway from another tablet, so why not AmazonThe biggest gripe of other reviewers seems to be Amazon's aggressive advertising and link to their ecosystem.  I have the special offers (cheaper) version, and don't really find the ads annoying (if I did $20 would fix that).  And I like the direct link to Amazon's content.  Nor does Amazon try to prevent you from sideloading APKs (they actually give you an installer on the device) nor from rooting (you can relatively easily install CyanogenMod I've heard).  In truth, I think rooting would be a big mistake, as you would lose out on Amazon's ecosystem without gaining anything.  The better route is to sideload the Nova Launcher (or there are several other launchers that do just as well) as they more or less remove any advertising, and give you a more conventional Android interface.  I make sure that I have links on the Nova Launcer dock to Amazon store and to Silk.  It's the best of both worlds.Update...I've had my HDX for two weeks now, and am pleased that Amazon has such a light hand in controlling their UI.  I've loaded the Nova Launcher on my HDX, with docked icons for Kindle Store, and Silk Browser.  The result is a better UI than IOS or Nexus 7.  Almost everything I want is sideloadable.  I tried sideloading GooglePlay (*HaHa*) but that didn't work for a fairly obvious reason -- Amazon did not want to be responsible for an App that collects payments outside their own ecosystem (it opens up a host of headaches for them).I purchased the NETGEAR Push2TV Wireless Display HDMI Adapter - Miracast and WiDi (PTV3000) and after a bit of fiddling (I had to load the latest update to get the HDX to mirror) had it working.  For those who don't know, this essentially provides the sort of display mirroring on a TV that you get with Apple TV and the iPad, but without the content limitations.  It works flawlessly, and I have been using this more than my Roku3 to watch movies, YouTube, etc.  The X-ray feature on Amazon Videos is nice (essentially access to IMDB database while watching a movie) works well, and is actually quite useful.I even used the Mayday button once trying to set up the Netgear Push2TV ... it works as advertised and Amazon staff are great!In my opinion for a variety of reasons which I would classify under the general rubric of Amazon's \"ecosystem\" the HDX is better than Nexus 7 and iPad Mini-Retina (which is ridiculously overpriced), which makes it the best 7\" tablet available.Oh... and be sure to buy the Amazon Kindle Fire HD Standing Polyurethane Origami Case (will only fit All New Kindle Fire HD 7\"), Mineral Black ... this is (if you  look at product reviews) an unloved and misunderstood accessory.  I was not impressed when I first got it, but now that I own it, I think it is the best case out there (though too expensive in my opinion).  The stand and magnetic cover work as advertised.  The tray that the Kindle sits in is magnetic and holds the HDX well, but allows it easily to be removed and reinserted.", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Outstanding with a couple of short comings!!!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3TAV0UJT1DPQX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great screen, but needs GPS CHIP.

It is SO worth the upgrade to the HDX!  Love how user friendly it is, love the new email system, love the vibrant colors, love the feature that tracks how quick/slow you read and how much time/pages left to the end of a chapter.  This is just the beginning!  I can't imagine how much greater it probably is!  I can't wait to get the time to play with it more!  Thank you Amazon for another GREAT Kindle!A follow up!!!  Since my original review, I've had to return not only the original, but TWO more!!!  The first two would not hold a charge when in sleep mode.  The third one was charging for NINE hours and only made it up to 58% charged!  To make matters worse it came with no original box, which worried me as to if it was refurbished.  Amazon admitted it was a mistake and I was sent refurbished.  This has been a HUGE frustration dealing with having to call each time, packing them up and then making the 25-30 minute drive one way to our local UPS store!  I have no doubt I will love this device if I ever get one that works the way it is supposed to work!To date I have yet to receive an HDX that will hold a charge.  I am now on the 5th unit.  I cannot keep the internet on or will will drain within a few hours to dead.  In fact just downloading my latest books will drain at least 25% of my power that I had before turning on the internet to download the books.  Out of frustration I have kept this 5th one and just don't turn the internet on.  Now after just a month of using it, the screen keeps flashing like it is going to die/go blank.  This is the WORST problem I've ever had with any electronic device I've had!  Although Amazon is fine with sending replacements over and over there has been no compensation for my aggravation and the 1 hour drive to get it to the nearest USPS store to drop off the duds!VERY unhappy with Amazon at this point and I have lost a lot of faith in their customer service!", "Date": "December 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love it!", "Author": "Gloria E Shank", "ReviewID": "R3BRNXZESE3G6X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love it!

The reason I upgraded was to be able to download Prime videos.  The last thing I thought I would use was the Mayday button - I usually am the person that other people come to with electronics questions.  To my surprise, the Mayday button was helpful even for me.  There was a problem with me having too many Kindle devices registered, so my books would not open on the new device.  Even though I could have fixed that myself, contacting Mayday got the job done faster.  I talked with two Mayday operators since buying this new Kindle - both were easy to understand and knowledgeable.The sound and HD screen is very impressive, a big improvement over my Fire from 2012.  The processor is also impressively fast.  I have to say that battery life is not great, but adequate.  I have yet to try using the device with the WiFi off, which likely would improve battery life.  I don't find the special offers to be intrusive - they are only on the unlock screen, and are kind of like a screen saver.

After exactly a week spending with it, I have couple of issues which in my opinion were the deal breakers and with me ending up deciding to return it.So here's the list of good & bad:Disclaimer: The Kindle Fire was at it's latest firmware during my use & tests. No, I am not on payroll of either Google or Apple. I am just an tech geek who owns various devices and wants to see Kindle Fire tablet fix it's Achilles Heels for good.(GOOD)1) Device is extremely light and comfortable to hold.2) It looks & feels gorgeous.3) The display is one of the best. I already have a ipad2 with me and I enjoyed watching movies on the Kindle Fire to be honest.4) It's very fast when it comes to streaming stuff.5) One of the best speakers. The bass and clarity is amazing.6) Got just the apps to get you started.(BAD)1) The power and volume buttons on either side are badly placed and poorly designed in the sense that, you can't differentiate which one is which by just feeling them. I had to keep turning it back to see if I wasn't pressing the power button. Many a times during the first couple of days I ended up pressing the power button instead of volume. So if the lights are off, you will be groping in the dark for those buttons.2) The wifi suddenly loses connection and shows an x mark in spite of it being connected to the wifi network per se. But, it won't go to the internet. The only solution is to reboot the device, after which the x mark on the wifi goes away and everything is rosy once again.3) The sound suddenly stops working. It happened to me twice and both times, the reboot was the solution. I felt like I wasn't using an Android tablet, rather a Windows OS for a minute.4) I am sure the above issues are software bugs which can be fixed in the next firmware update. But, after shelling out 200$ one expects some basic functionality like Wifi & Sound to work without a hitch every other time. These are the things which can't be overlooked. I can overlook the limited app store,but not basic stuff which we ought to take it as granted.5) This is one is not a deal breaker, but wanted to lay it out there with the hope that Amazon will listen to it's loyal customer. If you are looking to side-load Google Apps(G+,Maps,Hangouts,Gmail,etc) with the exception of Youtube, you are out of luck. The youtube app too is just barely functional in the sense that you cannot sign in to your account. That's out of question. I am not impressed with Amazon's closed ecosystem policy even though I understand it's business reasons. What might be good for business in short term might hurt the company in the long term. I feel, Amazon has handicapped such a capable & powerful hardware by limiting the software ecosystem. Every person on the internet,whether Amazon likes it or not uses Google Services one way or the other and by alienating that user base, Amazon not only is slowing the adoption of this beautiful tablet, but also losing lot of customers to Google nexus.", "Date": "November 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Highly recommended", "Author": "Sherrie L.
