{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Akaso R7X", "Author": "Paws", "ReviewID": "R1PG315K73KCF8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the Akaso R7X with the expectation of receiving a cheap tablet, i am typically not a person to settle for something cheaper, i have expensive Samsung screens, Asus and Samsung 120hz monitors.-PerformanceThe performance of this tablet is actually very good for it's price point, Antutu Benchmarked an average score of 11780, in comparison an ASUS Transformer prime scores just over 12400 and that is a $320+ tablet. The Google Nexus 7 tablet scores only just above the R7X, a negligible difference, most of what you're paying for is the screen in both of those devices. In real world applications, i had a podcast running in the background while reading a PDF transcript, while switching between Office SuitePro 7 and my college school app, i occasionally had to open the browser to copy text for reference, needless to say this device has plenty of power to run multitasking apps. I tested 720p, 1080p, 1080p 120fps and 4000 resolution videos, the 720 did fine, 1080p did great aswell, the 1080p 120fps video ran at 92fps, meaning the hardware hit it's limit in bit rate streaming, most BluRay are 60fps so this device can perform BluRay standard quality in video streaming, the 4k video file was unwatchable, however my Nexus 7 can't play it smoothly either.The amount of memory available is about 520MB as the JellyBean OS uses a good chunk of memory compared to the previous ICS, it is more likely you will hit the RAM limit of this device before you experience any real multitasking performance problem.The browsing experience is nice and fluid on this tablet, in fact i find it to be a better experience than my Nexus 7. It is important to note that Adobe has cut flash support for android devices in JellyBean (Which the R7X runs on) If you download the Dolphin browser you can still access some flash content, however embedded videos will not play, there are alternative browsers with a forced built in flash but the quality is not there.-ScreenThe first thing i did when i got my tablet was look it over for issues and defects, because the screen is the majority of user interaction, from visual fidelity to touch sensitivity. The touch sensitivity is good, accurate and keeps up with games and applications i tested.The screen is between \"moderate\" and \"ok\", you will find quickly that the maximum brightness is rather low in my opinion, but still enough to be vibrant in an Indoor-sunlit area. All of the colors are very nice and clean however the blacks have a minor wash out, nothing you really couldn't look past and the whites look like a grayish paper tone compared to the Samsung displays.One of my worries was the clarity of the display, i can say with confidence that this display's clarity is suitable for most anything, because i read a lot of Japanese text it is important that i can identify small strokes in Kanji, which i can do with this.-BatteryI am not taking a star away for this, the battery takes quite awhile to charge and under heavy use this tablet will start warning you of low battery after about 2 hours, that's rather short lived (Please note, \"Heavy use\" is defined as using more applications and features simultaneously than the average or even super user) watching videos that do not require WiFi, music or just casual web browsing will give you a good 4 to 6 hours, having the brightness down half way when not using the display (such as for music) or having the display off with music in the background can yield even more time, but be wary the battery life is enough to complete one or (big maybe) two movies streaming.The cost to performance for this tablet is unmatched, If i were on the fence between the Nexus 7, the Asus Transformer or anything of the sort, you will be much happier with this tablet and that extra $100 to spend on other things, or even a second tablet, if i have any alternate recommendations, it is that a 9 or 10 inch screen would make a better experience in my opinion.-Things to consider*I recommend the Dolphin Browser instead of the one they have preinstalled, it will enhance your experience and negate any feeling of poor performance the stock browser may give.*Find an \"App Killer\" on the Play Store when you get this tablet, there is no way to kill processes and this will run your battery down in standby mode if left on, plus it will eat the memory quickly.*This tablet supports my 32GB HC Class10, i was able to transfer at around 17MB/s using USB 3.0 through the device.I would recommend this tablet to anyone, as long as you don't set your expectations ridiculously high, you will actually be very surprised at how powerful and well done this tablet is.", "Date": "July 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "great", "Author": "timothy j bartolovich", "ReviewID": "R3QJKZUE2YG4NO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It was everything I expected and then some .

When using it for email and facebook you might get 2 hours of solid use but gaming kills the battery at under 45 minutes, kind of defeating the purpose of a tablet. The packaging was impressive and they give you plenty of adapters but I found it strange that I couldn't use the micros USB adapter I power my phone with on this tablet. Also another bad area is the storage, they give you 8GB BUT its spread across 2 drives. You main OS drive has about 512mb free after the OS, then there is roughly 7.5GB on a 2nd HDD, which is fine except if you download a large app from the Play Store (BTW some generic android tablets won't even run the Play store so it was nice its installed) it won't see the 2nd storage space and just won't install. Smaller apps are easily installed to the first HDD and moved to the second HDD via the application manager. It took less than a week to realize that it just would not work out and I sent the tablet back.", "Date": "August 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Dual Core - thumbs up!", "Author": "jay", "ReviewID": "R35N8Q49IY6C0J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We have had it only 24 hours.

I have a Nexus 7, my son has an el cheapo chinese 7\" ICS tablet for games and educational apps, and we bought this tablet for my wife.This thing nicely splits the difference between the cheap chinese tab and my N7.  The screen is bright and clear, and while it isn't as crisp as my N7's display, it is easy to look at and read from.  It is very snappy and responsive.  The build quality is better than expected.  All in all this is a GREAT tab for under $100.Weaknesses:  It can get a bit warm, the battery indicator isn't always exactly accurate, and if you run the screen at full brightness you will drain the battery VERY FAST.  Keep it dimmed!  Even at 25% brightness everything is clear.  The speakers are a bit weak, but if you are plugging in headphones or external speakers this won't be an issue.Overall, I don't think you'll find a better tablet for the price (new).  If something ever happened to my N7 I wouldn't feel terrible about replacing it with a tablet like this, which I could not say about my son's cheaper lower resolution tablet.", "Date": "July 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Is good for the money!", "Author": "Gerardo", "ReviewID": "R26LA2MAMML3O4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I need it to Check E-mail's, if you have a Google account this tablet can be sync to it.
