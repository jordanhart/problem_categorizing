Detailed Review", "Author": "Daisy S \"Daisy S\"", "ReviewID": "R3R66LZ6ZVN4Q6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For almost months now, I have owned this tablet and it has run wonderfully for  me.Because I used it so much, I have tested thoroughly  and found that it does have overall advantages. So as a techie, I tested this tablet out and below I will list what I have found to be the Pros and Cons of this tablet and have listed what I personally discovered. Then this will hopefully help you to decide if this is the right tablet for you or not...(By the way, to let you know,Something to consider: If you are looking for a COMPACT VERY PORTABLE and lightweight WiFi only tablet (and do not need the phone part), consider this tablet. (This is my favorite size because I can carry in my purse, tote, gym bag etc so easily! While it does not have every bell and whistle installed on it, it is a good choice for: Checking emails, Getting Online, Looking at Pictures, Watching Home Movies.Here are the Pros and the Cons below.PROS:1- WiFi connects easily and the signal is SUPERB in most places I tested. (Found the WiFi signal is VERY STRONG in my home and even in my backyard). This model has the strongest WiFi signal of any tablet or phone that I own! And it stays on the WiFi for long distances without dropping the signal EVER!2- The advantage of having a SD card slot that will hold up to 64GB.3- Small and lightweight. Comfortable to carry around and place in backpack or briefcase easily.4- Micro USB Port - This is common in most tablets these days, but the older Tab 2 line did not have micro port but the propriety wider port.5- Screen clarity - For me, I found this screen easy to read eBooks on and view internet pages.CONS:- 8GB internal storage - this it the advertized storage before Samsung added the OS, apps, Touch Wiz and because the OS takes up room, apps etc, take up room, the tablet just has about 4.7GB in the internal storage when you receive the tablet. No problem really I still have over 4 GB left on mine after all of my apps I added from Playstore.Bottom line and Summary:** Price and New to Tablet Person (or for a child/student) - For the low cost of about 160 (or less if used) dollars, this tablet will make a very nice FIRST TABLET or a TABLET FOR KIDS as it is a lower cost tablet that is easy to learn and has lots of features for the money. For just 160 dollars or so new, I find this a very good buy and this tablet may just be the one for you.** Experienced Tablet Person - If this is NOT your first tablet and you want a higher end tablet, and want to spend just a little bit more say about 90 more dollars, then you may want to consider the Tab 3 8.0 with 16GB of internal storage and larger screen etc. Also there are many very nice 7 inch tablets out there to choose from that have better specs and better screen resolution and better internal storage.If you are to have any questions about this tablet, you may ask me in the comment section and I will answer right away.", "Date": "July 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent form factor, and good improvement from previous model", "Author": "rpv", "ReviewID": "R78ORS5ALXE5G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There are too many tablets these days, right?! Samsung's third generation of Galaxy Tab series is highly anticipated and for this price point phenomenal. I have been using Galaxy Tab 2 and I will compare and contrast here. I played around with review units of all sizes and I have since returned them. My reviews are unbiased and neutral! First, if you have not had any tablets before, Get THIS! Yes, Get this 7\". It is ideal for plane trips, long journeys. I had used a 7\" Tablet on a long journey to listen to songs and read epub books (Aldiko) and it was a very pleasant experience. 7\" form factor is lightweight, compact and great. If you are a bit experienced and can afford it, I highly recommend the 8\". In my opinion 8\" is the maximum value for the money and features and hence I gave 8\" a 5 star. I gave 7\" a 4 star (but no means undermining it). I gave the 10\" also a 4 star because of some strange spec `limitations'.Samsung has introduced 7\", 8\" and 10.1\" of the Tab 3 series. They are entering all form factors. As I know they have something in 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10\" lines. Woo.. All of the 7, 8, 10\" Galaxy Tabs come in white and golden brown color. My preference is white color. Looks pretty!Let's start off with salient points of all of the Galaxy Tab 3 series. I will later compare with the previous Tab 2 model.7-inch tablet: 1024 x 600, Marvell dual-core 1.2GHz processor, 1GB RAM, 8GB built-in storage (ROM), a microSD card slot (up to 64 GB), Camera: 3MP rear-facing, 1.3MP front-facing and weighs 10.58 oz. (300 grams). Android 4.1.28-inch model: 1280 x 800, Exynos 1.5GHz dual-core processor, 1.5GB ram, 16GB of built-in storage (ROM), a microSD slot (up to 64 GB), Camera: 5MP rear-facing, 1.3MP front-facing and weighs 10.9 oz. (309 grams) Android 4.210.1-inch model: 1280 x 800,  Intel Atom 1.6GHz Z2560 dual-core processor, 1GB RAM, a 16GB built-in storage (ROM), a microSD slot (up to 64 GB), Camera: 3.2MP rear-facing, 1.3MP front-facing and weighs 17.99 oz. (510 grams). Android 4.2I am not going into other details like accelerometer etc. as they are all standard these days, Audio support - AAC, AMR, MP3, OGG, WMA/ASF, 3GA/M4A, FLAC, WAV; MP3/MP4/Music Tones; Music Player; Ringtones, Polyphonic. Video support: AVI/DIVX, WMV/ASF, FLV, MKV, MP4/3GP, WEBM; Video Player; Video Streaming. Software is current of release date, and it is expected could be upgraded as next version Android 5 Key Lime Pie. (Currently targeted for Oct 2013). Key Lime Pie's one of the main touting points is compatibility to avoid fragmentation, so I can foresee, all of these models being able to upgrade if Google keeps their promise.The 7\" has a physical home button so are others in the series.  Also has capacitive Back and Menu buttons. Camera is a 1.3-megapixel front-facing camera for skype, and a 3-megapixel rear-facing camera. It is also equipped with an IR blaster so it will work as a universal remote on both your TV and cable box. Camera is only so and so, and I will not rely on it to produce outstanding photos. Weighs only 300 gm. 64 GB SD card is awesome! With prices plummeting for 64 GB cards, it is a great boon. Put all your music, books, photos on the SD card and you have a powerful computer in hand always! I personally use the 64 GB microSD card on my mobile devices. Get this mobileUltra (SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 6 Memory Card with SD Adapter - Retail Packaging.Galaxy Tab 2 is 345 grams, so Tab 3 is lighter by 45 grams.  Processors are similar 1.2 GHz dual core in Tab 3 Vs 1 GHz dual core in Tab 2. Resolutions are same with Tab 2 1024 x 600 pixels (~170 ppi pixel density). Tab 3 supports up to 64 GB whereas Tab2 is 32 GB. Not a big deal unless you have tons of video/photo/ebooks/music you want to carry with you all the time. I use a mixture of on device storage + Google Music + box for my data needs.  Battery is also same between Tab 2 and Tab 3 7\" versions - Non-removable Li-Ion 4000 mAh battery.Both have Bluetooth 3.0.  I cannot confirm still if Tab 3 7\" supports OTG.  I know for sure Tab 3 8\" supports as I tested it.  USB Host is one of the most undernoticed features of Androids and is in my opinion one of the best features compared to iPad lines. What this means you get a USB Host cable also otherwise called OTG (On the Go) cables and plug in your USB thumb drive or other USB devices and the device recognizes it. I have used it with Alfa AWUS036H for a wireless project with Android PCAP Capture from reputable Kismet wireless.  Another much ignored feature is the TV-out (via MHL A/V link). Unfortunately the 7\" does not support it whereas 8in and 10.1 in supports it. You can connect Galaxy devices to a TV to make it truly a fantastic computer if the device supports MHL. Throw in a Bluetooth keyboard and it is awesome. Leo Laporte's TwIT TV which is Internet based show has one full episode in Know How on covering this topic. GPS was spot on and I tried multiple GPS apps. It was bright outdoors (had to crank the brightness all the way up). I personally use Navigon from Garmin and have downloaded several apps.Finally, believe me, don't get mired in the spec game. 7\" is equally capable as a 8in for `most' day to day apps. If you are reading books, browsing, listening to music, looking at photos 7\" is more than enough. Samsung is creating markets for all form factors and I would consider this as an exploratory stage. Just like Ford or Toyota has cars in different shapes, sizes and price range, so are the tablet vendors now. Remember the laptop wars, 10\", 12\" 13\", 15, 17 and even some 19\" if I remember right few years ago. We used to debate endlessly which laptop sizes are better, which has better speakers and so on. The time has come to fight it out for tablets!I tried following apps and they just worked awesome. A tablet is only as good as the apps you have and how productive it makes you. It's almost like the camera/lens analogy in the DSLR space. What good it is to have a great DSLR body if you have no good lens? Same with Tablet body and apps you have.WolframAlpha (I can go on for hours praising this. This is a truly genius app powered by hundreds of supercomputers in the background. Wolfram is a computational genius). Well worth the $3 price.Withings HealthMate. (another remarkable app great UI/UX). I am getting the Pulse device as soon as it hit stores.

I bought this product after a thorough research on all the contemporary products at this range.Samsung has done great with the package and look. I got mine in white and it looks great,easy to carry especially if you read when you travel . Good thing they added the home button which makes the navigation much simpler and faster. Memory is expandable upto 64 gb. Comes with an unique feature tv remote,it's pretty cool to be able o control ur smart tv without any additional hardware. It has a sensor which communicates perfect with various brands of tv. The difference of this remote from the other ones,is this does not require the tv to be on network. Samsung watch on is a great feature, I think this wasn't there in the earlier versions. Jelly bean processor,1.2 ghz dual core processor makes the navigation much smoother than galaxy tab 2. The price is a big plus for this one. Now comes the cons. The voice assist feature is very very slow and robotic compared to Siri. The wifi connectivity needs improvement. It's not that fast compared to apple( but you get what you pay for). One more negative point is the resolution , kindle fire hd and nexus has hd resolution for the same price when this product comes with hundred times lesser resolution of 1024*800. Don't know why samsung dint add hd which is very very common in the recent devices. Other than all this ,if you are looking a easy to carry,light,smart and stylish device with a great storage and most Importantly cheaper tab, then this is the one for you", "Date": "July 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Raging Disappoinment", "Author": "Nick Adegite", "ReviewID": "R3TPF6XMNHJDMU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Did some research as to high quality but low cost tablets and found three main competitors; Galaxy tab 3, Google nexus 7 and I-pad mini. Granted I-pad mini isn't that cheap but size wise in same bracket.I purchased the SG tab 3 because it was comparable price to nexus 7 but huge interest in expandable storage. Since I brought that up I'll address that now. Expandable storage was a great concept but wasted idea. In past android was able to move all apps to your SD card in order to improve your performance for your device.SD Card:Currently however, it appears everyone and there mother has moved away from that feature. Basically, songs and documents can be moved over to the SD card and the card itself is purely internal storage. Doesn\u2019t sound like a bad deal, well here\u2019s some insight. If you like apps like mostly everyone does, the more apps you have, the slower your tablet will operate. I found myself waiting more times than not for simple apps to load or simply swiping to the next screen. If you want a tablet for the sole purpose of looking at pictures and opening documents, you got a winner. If apps, gaming, and productivity are you\u2019re strong point, this tablet is not for you.Features:The next point of information, the SG tab 3 is the lowest grade tablet for the SG market. It does have a beautiful display and when the planets align a generally good overall experience but this usually only happens when you first load the tablet, remove any background tasks and operate only one app, like a new reader. Instructions on features for the tablet are none existent and if advertised features on the internet sparked you interest for this tablet, it\u2019s only for the SG tab3 8 inches. Not even the 10 inch has theses bells and whistles.The pull down menu is however amazing allowing you to control all features such as turning on and off options like Wi-Fi, airplane mode, battery saving without ever having to open the settings. Some features have like the auto dimmer for instance end up being more of a pain then a luxury constantly changing your screen brightness making it usually to dim.BatteryAs far as the battery life for the tablet\u2026.don\u2018t hold your breath. If max charge is achieved it is after several hours of charging. Once you\u2019ve waited 2.5 to 3 hours to enjoy your tablet, the power quickly drains away never really reaching that advertised 8 hour lifetime.This next point I have separated because it is VERY IMPORTANT\u2026UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD YOU DEPLETE YOU\u2019RE BATTERY TO 0%.  A common grip on the internet is that tablets of all brands and style are not turning back on. Either China is pissed or android has got a major problem on their hands. Once the battery dies from use, unless you immediately charge it after dying, you\u2019re tablet will not turn back on. If you think I\u2019m joking go to this link [...]I understand they are saying it happens to the SG tab 2, but Tab 3 owners of the 7.0 inch beware\u2026it happens to you to. I received my tab on 9/6/2013 and it died 9/10/2013. RIP Tab 3, we never really got to know each other. That aside I have requested for another to replace my currently dead and defective SG tab 3 7 inch so we shall see how that pans out. If it doesn\u2019t work out, there\u2019s always I pad. I will admit, though my hate or apple is quite large, they know how to make a fully functional device.Overall:Screen has great display and movies look great as well as reading whether it be books or comic books. The Google Play store has a ton of apps making the tablet a good source of entertainment but don\u2019t get too many apps of you\u2019ll bog down your tablet. No matter how big your SD card is, it won\u2019t make you tablet faster. Features are basic and are comparable to that of a generic low budget tablet. The SG tab 3 operates fairly slowly no matter how much ram you free up. Battery life is abysmal and if you ever let the battery reach zero, you\u2019ll never turn it back on again unless you have your charger with you at all time. Hate to say it but if Android is lacking the tablet department and unless you want to spend high dollar for a tablet ($300+) you might be better off using your smart phone.Good luck and happy hunting,Android enthusiast.", "Date": "September 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Overpriced in todays market, Much better value out there", "Author": "Truthteller", "ReviewID": "R20V51I5TLSMHK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The Samsung 3 7\" should probably not be considered in the same grouping as the other Tab 3 products (the 8\" and 10.1\"), because it is so much less that either of those.  The problem isn't that it is poorly made, just that it is missing some very important features found on the other models, and it is way overpriced for what it does have in today's market.Before going further, and not to insult any other reviewers, but I have read a lot of reviews on this product on many websites now, and the conclusion I have come to is that the people who rave about this product very often are 1) speaking from a very short experience with it or 2) this tablet is their first one and they have neither good comparisons, nor have they researched the market well enough to know where this tablet fits in the current market in terms of features and pricing. It is a nice \"looking\" tablet.  Mine is white and its \"handsome\".  It's size is comfortable, although it is slightly heavy for its size\".  It is thin and pretty sleek, but all of that is pretty superficial.  It is, however, at least \"last year's\" technology if not 18 month old, and so is the pricing.There are several reviews here which indicate people had the Tab 2 7\" and were pleased with it, and then \"upgraded\" to the Tab 3 7\" and were blindsided by the throwback in technology.  While I have not owned the Tab 2 7\", I have looked it over, and compared it to my Tab 3 7\" and I have to agree. The Tab 2 7\" has the same resolution screen as the Tab 3 7\" but the older one is brighter and has higher contrast, which can be important if you are in brighter lighting.  The Tab 2 7\" uses a 30 pint connector, which some don't like, but one very important aspect to that connector was that you could buy numerous inexpensive cables and accessories (for under $5) that allowed you to plug a card reader, thumb drive, hard drive, keyboard, mouse or game controller into it.  The Tab 3 7\" has a more standard micro USB port, but it is only useful for charging the tablet or to connect it to a USB cable to interface it with a computer.  It will not acknowledge any of the other devices mentioned, regardless of the cable you use because Samsung decided to remove the hosting ability of the USB port on this model.  The Tab 3 8\" for about $100 more or the 10.1\" both have hosting USB and work with a cheap OTG USB cable.  Not the Tab 3 7\".What this means is that your only choice for storage of images, documents, music or videos is to transfer them onto a micro SD card and use the micro SD reader in the tablet.  If you have stuff already stored on a full size SD card from your camera, or a thumb drive, you have to use a computer in between, or WiFi or Bluetooth if your other devices have that ability.  Most Android devices since about version 3.1 (the Tab 3 7\" uses 4.1.2) have a host USB port.  Google suggests they all SHOULD (their emphasis) have one.The screen itself is acceptable but not that sharp.  You can do much better with resolution, brightness and contrast in the same price range with other brands.  The colors are a bit muted on the Tab 3 7\".The WiFi and GPS are both weak.  Mine unit drops the connections quite often.As others have mentioned, although the Tab 3 7\" allows you to put up to a 64 GB micro SD card into the unit, it only can be used to store personal media (documents, music, movies, images, etc).  You can't access and run apps from it.  The 8 GB RAM within the unit is pretty limited, as the basic OS and out of package apps leave you with under 5 GB left to store apps.  Once again, currently the market in tablets supports units with 16 to 32 GB internal memory for about the same price as the Tab 3 7\". The unit has a dual core 1.2 GHz processor, but its pretty slow for those specs and gets bogged down easily.  Once again, in the same price range one can find tablets running faster processors of dual to quad core and 1.5 to 2 GHz.The provided factory apps are enough to start with, but basic.  Unfortunately, Samsung, like everyone else, wants to get you to their own app store for content (ebooks, movies, and other media) and so they have apps for these gateways.  I don't see any advantage over Google Play and other options, and those extra apps just take up precious RAM space.Like several others have mentioned, my unit has been a bit flaky so far. The auto screen brightness gets stuck in dim mode and won't come out of it unless I reset the brightness manually.  The screen occasionally jitters for no apparent reason.  The screen text size will suddenly decide to shrink while I am scrolling with one finger.  For a while, when I asked the weather report, it gave me Cambridge Mass, even though I am on the west coast of Canada.However, by far, the worst aspect of this tablet (besides the inflated price for its features) is Samsung's customer service.  Their people are very pleasant, will promise you the world, and will deliver on nothing they promise.  They do not advance your case even when they say they will, they do not email you back even when they promise, you can call them, email them, it makes no difference.  They basically give lip service. Their \"executive customer service\" supposedly a second tier, is a joke.  Do not expect any assistance from these people, you are on your own, whether it is a technical question or a warranty issue.If you do not believe how bad their support is, Google Samsung Customer Service Reviews, their are literally thousands of complaints you can read.If this tablet cost about half of its list price, I would probably give it 2-3 stars, but these days ratings are not just about what you get, but what you get for the price you pay, and how that compares to other products on the market, and so with that in mind, the one start seems appropriate.  Lastly, for those of you who are wondering why I ended up with this device when I know what else is out there, it was unfortunately a gift.  I just want to warn those of you who can select a tablet yourself, that you can do much better for the same money with other brands (and maybe even customer support that cares about you).", "Date": "November 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "My Constant Companion, Samsung Galaxy  Tab 3,~zero complaints...", "Author": "Denise M.

I own three: the original NookColor, which is highly outdated and is now used by my grandchildren. A 8.9\" KindleFire wi-fi/4G which both my wife and I really like.  And this Galaxy Tab 3, 7\".Making comparisons is very subjective since what I like maybe isn't what you're looking for.I definately like the Tab 3.  It has good screen resolution for a 7\".  Decent sound from its tiny stereo speakers located on the bottom when its standing upright. It's easy to use and came with a lot of apps.  Any other apps are readily availabe.  I downloaded the Amazon app program and the Barnes and Noble book reader so I have access to everything I already paid for from those two sources.One thing I like about the Samsung that's not on the Kindle is I can view QuickTime videos taken with an I-phone.  The Samsung offers you the opportunity to convert Q-Time to a more usable non-Apple format.This is a very competetive market and tablets will undoubtedly offer more features for less money as time goes by.

I lead with that information in order to provide some context in describing the Tab 3 which is simply a wonderful device for the money and for the ease of operation in most anything you'd want a tablet for and to do.The display is far improved over the earlier tab.  It's like going for SD to HD in one fell swoop.  The setup and getting it synced with the home network wifi was far easier than I had thought it would be.  The same can be said for tying into the Google disciplines.  Once I set up my existing Google Gmail transfer, I was able to easily tap into my existing Amazon kindle account and start reading from my personal books library.  The Tab 3 is fast, looks great and is easy to operate.  Also, within the first 10 minutes of setup, I accessed my Netflix account and was viewing various movies which came in LOUD (good volume/speakers) and clear.Summing up, the Tab 3 is a significant upgrade over the first Samsung Tab and for the price of about $200, I don't see how you can beat the value with any other device out there.", "Date": "July 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome tablet", "Author": "Emily", "ReviewID": "R33UK56ROZEWQ1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this as my first tablet, and I must say I really like it a lot. The size is perfect to fit in one hand. The screen is nice, bright, and clear. It's perfect for what I wanted and needed it for. It took a while to figure out and get used to (and after having it about 3 weeks I'm still figuring out a few things).Youtube videos are good quality. The only issue with these is that sometimes your hand blocks the wifi signal so the video buffers until you move your hand, or in some cases I've had to hold the whole tablet away to get the signal back.Apps and games load quickly and are fast and clear.I use chrome as a browser and at times it is a bit slow loading pages, but usually closing active apps and clearing the ram helps the speed a bit. The ability to stretch the page to zoom in is useful for sites with very small fonts/images.It's very easy to customize your pages (once you figure out how) and personalize the tablet to your liking. I have played around with ipods and ipads and they have no customizing other than moving the app icons around, so using the android wins in this case. It's hard to find wallpapers that fit the screen properly, but since there are so many other ways to customize the tablet with widgets and such, it's not a big issue.The 8GB space (which is really only around 5GB when you get it) isn't very much but is fine for using a few apps and playing games. You have the option of adding an SD card, but since I don't plan on downloading movies or music I won't need it, since you can't put apps on the card anyway.The camera quality is pretty good, especially outdoors. Indoor photos aren't quite as good and are more grainy, but there are always apps that make photos more clear.If there was one thing I'd want to have on this tablet is better notifications. That's one of the only ways the ipod/ipad beats this with features. Often the tablet makes a sound when there is a notification but nothing comes up on the screen at the same time or even shows on the lock screen. If you want to see what the sound was for, you have to unlock the tablet, pull down the top bar and then see it. It's much more convenient to see a notification message pop up right on the screen.I've recommended this tablet to a few people already. Maybe in the future I'd even be willing to spend a bit more to get the 10-inch one (especially since I really want the split-screen feature).

Because of its anemic storage capacity (8gb, and half of it is used up by worthless shovelware which can't be uninstalled), users of this tablet will want to transfer apps to the sd card. Unfortunately, Samnsung's Galaxy Tab 3 will not support ANY App to SD applications.Say you download a movie from vudu. The Vudu app does not show up in \"my files\" and can't be moved, even with a \"workaround nor with \"rooting. \"  So even if you have a 64 gb sd card, your storage capacity is extremely limited.  Since all downloads go straight to your internal memory (NO SUPPORT IS OFFERED FOR YOU TO DOWNLOAD STRAIGHT TO EXTERNAL SD), for downloads you must remove the the sd card, download the item to your sd via pc, and then put it back in.For those of us who download large files (like movies and pdf files), this is an unacceptable oversight.  I chose this tablet over the nexus 7 specifically because of the sd slot.  Now it is too late to return this garbage tablet.  So don't be a fool like I was. Buy a tablet that will suit your needs.  I can guarantee, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that it WON'T be this garbage tablet.Before any Android/Samsung fanboys get all defensive,  this is a well known manufacturer's  issue that vendors always fail to mention. Samsung has NOT offered any solutions to this serious problem. And trust me, with only 5 usable gbs of memory, it is a BIG problem.  Again, the usual workarounds do  NOT work with this tablet.Oh, and to those who say this is a Google issue, I disagree.  Many tablet manufacturers were aware of this and provide ROMS that allow App2SD to work.  Also, Android OS 4.2 will not have this problem.  I had read that the Tab 3 runs 4.2 but it does NOT, it runs 4.1.2.  According to Samsung, who I contacted directly, their 4.2 update will include App2SD support.  BUT, they have no idea when they plan to provide the update!Meanwhile, other tablets are already running 4.2 and allowing for App2SD to function properly.", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Construction trades friendly", "Author": "Signman Dave \"Signman Dave\"", "ReviewID": "RTHPFRAMOOVGM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As a contractor on the go the Tab 3 offers all the features I require to stay competitive.

Here's how to fix", "Author": "Chris Boylan \"MrBoylan\"", "ReviewID": "R3SV1DOF0TWRPI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First off, if you already own this tablet, and are having a problem getting your device to charge, turn on or power up, see below for a fix. For those considering buying one, here are my thoughts.Samsung makes great Android tablets (for the most part). I've owned a Galaxy Tab 2 and done some testing of other Samsung tablets as well.  They're responsive, offer a pretty straight-forward interface, full access to the Google Play Store (unlike Kindles), front and rear cameras, Bluetooth keyboard *and* Bluetooth mouse support and expandable storage via the microSD slot. This last bit is important if you want to keep local copies of music or movies (e.g., not rely on the Cloud) for mobile media entertainment.Also, the inclusion of an IR (InfraRed) port on the Galaxy Tab 3, and the remote app allows you to turn your tablet into a full-fledged touch screen home theater controller at no additional cost. For a gadget freak, this is pretty cool.  Overall, the fast processor, expandable storage, relatively low price, and wide selection of apps make the Tab 3 an excellent choice for a 7-inch tablet.But my experience with the Galaxy Tab 3 has been marred by a recurrent problem: sometimes the Tab 3 will become unresponsive: it won't charge, nothing lights up, and it won't turn on. This happened to the white Tab 3 I bought my daughter for Christmas after exactly one day of use. It happened again on the Tab 3 that Samsung sent as a replacement (the yellow kids' version) after about a week of use.  The first time, my daughter ran the tablet until the battery was exhausted and the unit shut itself down. After that, it never turned back on again despite multiple charging attempts from the factory charger plugged into the wall, or the factory USB/microUSB cable plugged into a computer.I looked online and found all kinds of suggested fixes: Hold the power button for 10 seconds, 30 seconds or 60 seconds (no joy).  Hold the power button and volume down button (again, nope). Hold the power button, home button and volume up button.  Still, NOPE! Try a trickle charge - plug the Tab 3 into a computer via the USB cable instead of the wall charger hoping that the lower amp charge from the computer would \"trickle charge\" the battery and fool it into charging. Again (at least for me) - FAIL!  But you are more than welcome to try these approaches as they are pretty simple and completely non-invasive.*HOW TO REALLY FIX THE POWER UP PROBLEM*What did work for me was to disconnect and reconnect the battery, then plug the unit back into its factory wall charger. After less than a minute, I saw the battery icon on the screen, and the unit began charging normally. Hooray! The only bad news about this is that it's not as simple as removing the back of a Galaxy phone. In fact, it's possible that attempting this will void your warranty, so proceed with caution!Getting the back off the Galaxy Tab 3 requires gently prying the edges away from the screen in the little crack between the screen and the case all around the perimeter of the screen. Doing this properly requires a thin plastic pry tool and some patience. I used a small jack knife, but would not recommend it due to the risk of scratches or even shorting out something inside the case. Once you've removed the back of the unit, gently lift the battery connector off its port by prying it toward you. Once it's disconnected, plug it back in by pushing it back down into place. Replace the cover by gently placing the tablet into its shell and pushing along the perimeter, snapping all the tabs back into place.There's an excellent video of this on YouTube by a user called, \"JerryRigEverything\" - search for \"Galaxy Tab 3 Battery Replacement\" and you should find it.  The only part you need to watch is the first one minute and 15 seconds to see how the cover comes off and how to separate the battery leads from the motherboard. You don't need to physically remove the battery or remove the screws that hold it in place to detach the battery leads from the motherboard. Once you've put it all back together, plug the tablet into the factory wall charger and USB cable. Within about a minute you should see the battery icon appear and normal charging should begin.Without this \"little\" issue, I'd rate the Galaxy Tab 3 as a 4-star or 5-star product. But with this major inconvenience, I have to downgrade it to 3 stars.  If it had only happened to one sample, I would have written it off, but seeing it happen to two different samples, and seeing how many other people are saying the exact same thing, I have to think it is endemic to all Tab 3s and it's only a matter of time before it happens to most owners. Let's hope Samsung figures out a software fix for this. Otherwise expect to see a bumper crop of factory-refurbished Tab 3s in the near future.If this helps you get your Tab 3 back up and running (or doesn't!), please let me know in the comments.By the way, in our case, the failures occurred when the app, \"Dragon City\" was running while the battery died. I know that can be a flaky app so am curious as to whether others who have this problem are also running that app.UPDATE: One more piece of flakiness on the Galaxy Tab 3. My daughter was unable to connect to the internet on her tablet the other day, even though it was successfully connected to WiFi and our router was fine. Upon investigation, we saw that the Tab 3 had reset its date to 1/1/2012. Once we went in and manually updated the date/time to the correct values, the tablet was able to connect to the internet again.

The Samsung on the other hand is a nice little 7 inch tablet, though 8 gigs of space turns into about 5 gigs of space and google only lets you load apps on the device. So the space fills up fast. I did learn to move my Audible books to the SD card and I can load most but not all my apps on this device. This device isn't as zippy as I thought it would be. But overall I like the tablet. I think the sweet spot for this type of tablet would be 16 gigs and SD expansion to 64 gigs is prefect hence the 8 inch tablet. But I wanted something smaller than my 10 inch tablets, and something I could just throw in my purse and listen to my audiobooks or read my e-books or listen to music etc. I am not crazy about Googles/Android web browsers and the whole Flash issues. My iPad I can visit news websites and watch the video, but you can't on a android tablet without a big hassle. iPads do not support Flash, but I can still watch the video???? But that is just an Android gripe. I did install Flash and it seems to work ok....Overall this is a good tablet so far, for the light user and with careful installation you can move some data to a memory card and make this thing more usable.

Roth", "ReviewID": "R3LI0X1O4NUTFD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I researched tablets extensively online before purchasing this one.  There was a certain budget and size I wanted to stay in, and when all was said and done this fit the bill.  I was taken aback at some of the reviews I read about it being slow or dying all of a sudden.  Of course I don't have a crystal ball, but as to the latter I'd say if you purchase a tablet with a lithium battery and certain sensibilities, it's good to take the time to read and heed the instruction manual and treat it accordingly, especially regarding charging. If I'm not mistaken (and I don't think I am), it comes with a one-year manufacturer's warranty. All this aside, compared to other tablets in the same class, Samsung's build quality and reliability seem unparalleled.  If it just up and dies on someone, I'd say it' s a manufacturing anomaly and not the norm.  People misuse and mishandle these tablets and then complain that it's junk, but I do believe there's more to those stories than meets the eye.Anyway, the funny thing is that I used my husband's Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 to do my research.  This was over a period of a couple of weeks, and as I went along searching and researching I came to like and trust the little gizmo.  He's had it for over a year now.  No problems!  It runs like a medium-grade laptop.  Sometimes it will take a second or two to go from one web page to another, or sometimes (I think because it's so small) you have to tap a couple of times to hit a link just right, but please.  Come on.  That's not slow.  That's not horrible.  That's fine.  It's good quality.  It's a Toyota.  It's not a Porsche.The display is beautiful.  The sound is remarkably nice, nice enough to listen to without a bluetooth speaker while you're puttering.  Both ways, depending on your preference at the moment, it works great.The Dolphin Browser, I find, is awesome to use on it if you dislike certain mobile apps as do I.  You can add your favorite websites to your speed dial and just go there.As for it running slowly, again, treat it as you would a $400-$500 laptop.  Clear the cache and make sure you don't have a jillion apps running all at once.  The Active Applications widget  and Clean Master app are awesome for doing this very easily and quickly.I've only used the camera a couple of times, but for casual picture taking I'd say it's quite good!  If you want something fancy, buy a camera.  Duh.In summary, if you're looking for a portable, reliable (and, I must say, very attractive and well-built) tablet you can carry around with you to watch movies and TV shows, check email, play light games, listen to music, visit your favorite websites, read, chat, Skype, etc., etc., you really can't go wrong with this baby!  It's not an iPad, and it won't open your garage door or wash your dishes, but it is a remarkably versatile device, and I'd say it's priced well.  Amazon's dropped the price lately, so keep an eye on that.  It's comparable to the price of the Lite version (which also looks excellent), but why get lite when you can get full fat?I could not be happier with my purchase.  If that changes, I'll let you know, but I don't think it will.", "Date": "March 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Dead after only 2 months But I found how to fix it", "Author": "Jack", "ReviewID": "R9674T1HN01JV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "and you cant return it and now will cost to try to get fixed, if it can be fixed.

I tried different chargers and cables and still no response. called the support as it was still under warranty and went through the steps with them pressing the button combinations as instructed by the support representative.

They told me to send it for repair and gave me the shipment label.The device itself is very good when it works. But it's a big flaw that the battery goes bad if it's completely discharged and it's not user replaceable. If I replaced it as shown on many videos online, I would've lost the warranty and replacing it needs screw drivers and some not so easy steps to disconnect the battery from the motherboard then reconnect the new one.They should've made the battery as reliable and user friendly as their cell phones to be able to change it without losing the warranty. But again a battery that goes bad upon complete discharge is unforgivable in a device like this.

I did not purchase this item from Amazon, but through Sprint, who is offering the tablet for $49.99 with a two-year data plan (I have absolutely no intention of using the data plan, but at $5/month, it works out to be a cheaper alternative than shelling out over $200 for a tablet with only half the memory).This tablet has every feature that I would ever want in a tablet.  The size is perfect--it is lightweight, but feels comfortable and sturdy while holding it.  It has an Android platform, so virtually every app is available for it (except those exclusive to Apple).  I have used it to watch movies, play games, and listen to music--and everything is just amazing.  I will, however, concede to the views of others regarding to the placement of the speaker...sound is great in portrait mode, not so great in landscape...so you might want to use headphones.

All the reviews i read on amazon were pretty close to the same, \"its better than tab 2 and great for the price!\" I'll start with what i liked about the Tab 3. Since it's a Samsung product, and i already had a Samsung Galaxy S Blaze phone, once I signed in using my Samsung account, all the apps i have on my phone started downloading automatically. Also, all of my wifi hotspots and passwords were transferred so i didn't have to remember and recall of my family's home network passwords. and since this is also a Google product, a simple sign in also allowed me access to all my Google accounts like youtube, gmail, and all the Google services that i participate in. The product is a nice size and fits in my hands well. It feels well put together, not cheap but not as sturdy as i was hoping either. the screen is bright and crisp and the touch responds well most of the time. it uses a micro usb cable to charge and connect to the computer. i already have 2 Samsung phones and an amazon kindle hd, so i didn't have to purchase any extra cables and can charge it where ever i have strategically placed a charging station around my home. I also love the microSD port that can expand the memory up to 64 Gigabits. Now i'll move on to some of the problems. i have had issues where the back button, common on android devices, just stopped working and i had to wait for it to become responsive again (restarting did not fix the issue). i also had an instance where i was surfing the web and then suddenly the wifi connection just stopped. It recognized the home network was there, it just wouldn't connect to it. I know it was working because i picked up my phone and started browsing using it with no issues. A restart fixed the issue but it still bothered me. Also when browsing it felt slow to me so again i picked up my phone and did a little test. i went to the same website on both my Galaxy Blaze and the Galaxy Tab 3. Every time, the phone loaded up the page quicker, even on refreshes. Which brings me to the most disappointing reason and the main reason i am returning it(other than the defects like the back button and wifi shutting off), my apps. Since all my apps starting downloading once i signed into my samsung and google account, i was pretty stoked that i wouldn't have to go find them individually and i wouldn't have to always use my phone for games, reading, or time killing apps. One of my favorite games is Simpsons: Tapped Out. Once everything was done downloading i fired up Tapped Out first. It worked fine for around 3 minutes, then it crashed back to the home screen. I tried to relaunch it, once i clicked to start playing, it crashed to the home screen again. i restarted the tablet and attempted to relaunch again. This time the game got hung on the loading screen and the back of the tablet next to the camera lens starting getting very hot (obviously this is where the processor is). i forced a restart and began to check if anyone else was having issues. This is a common issue with the game on the Tab 3 with many people not able to play. i couldn't understand why my 3 year phone can play game, that my 1 year old tablet couldn't. so i started to dig a little deeper. i found that many people are having game and app issues with the Galaxy Tab 3 and apparently this has to do with the resolution of the screen. The tab 3 has a resolution of 1024 X 600, while most newer apps require 1024X800 ( which is what most other tablets at least have if not higher). I have had issues with other apps that work fine on my phone but not on the tablet such as Lego: My City and the Chive app. i talked to someone from Samsung and they said the apps may not be completely compatible with my device. Again, i couldn't understand why my phone can play them flawlessly and this tablet cannot. Not all of the apps were glitchy or unusable, the Kindle app and Comixology worked very well and, even though slow, the web browsing worked okay. i also have Angry Birds and Bad Piggies loaded and those both worked as well. Maybe all these issues get fixed with a new android OS update(it's currently 4.1 Jellybean), maybe this is an isolated incident, but I'm not going to try again with this tablet and will recommend it only to those looking strictly for a reading device with occasional web browsing", "Date": "February 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "Krystle Vian", "ReviewID": "R28SQ2XRW0ZLD5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love my tablet.

It runs Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean, has a 1.2 GHz dual-core processor, with 8 GB of storage. This tablet is not the top of the line, fastest and best tablet on the market- it was designed to be a basic tablet and be affordable. For the price, you can't beat this tablet.The OS on this tablet is Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean. The OS runs well on the system, and is able to handle multiple applications at the same time. The OS also includes the ability to force close apps and clear RAM.The Tab 3 is also well designed. It is encased in white plastic, with a metal strip around the outside. The power and volume buttons are on the sides, with touch sensitive \"Back\" and \"Menu\" buttons, and one physical \"Home\" button on the face of the tablet. The charger port and speakers are on the bottom of the tablet, and the headphone jack is on the top. There is also a compartment for a MicroSD card on the side of the tablet.The Tab 3 also includes a cool feature for controlling other devices- there is an IR port built in to the side. Software comes loaded on the tablet to set up with your TV, Blu Ray, cable box, etc. Plus if you subscribe to major cable companies, you can load their channel lineups and guides right on screen.There is one last feature worth noting about this tablet. Since it is a Samsung product, it comes enabled with Samsung All Share Play. This is a great feature that allows you to share Photos, Videos and Music between Samsung devices. It's easy to set up within the device's Settings, there is an option to \"search\" for other devices. In my case, I have mine paired with my Samsung UN46EH5300 TV (review for that coming soon!). So if I want to watch a video on my tablet right on my TV (currently stored on a 64 GB MicroSD card), I just have to turn my tablet on and it appears in my TV's input selection list! When the video starts playing the tablet becomes the remote, giving you options to play, pause, rewind, etc. This All Share Play also integrates with apps like YouTube. For example, if I am watching a YouTube video, I have the ability to \"send\" the video feed to the TV (as long as it is turned on).Overall- I would recommend this to anyone looking for a tablet for everyday use.

I go to town on this thing.i can read pdf excel powerpoint presentations you have a world of apps.i dont know where this thing can go wrong. Im very careful about what I download if I dont use it its deleted.i havent saved much just still seeing how much it can manage.i did say before I started saving pictures & books I would get a micro sd card. the storage is expandable to I believe 64 gb.i can say so far the camera quality is a little ify.it may be one of those where you need bright light and a close up. Will test that more. Using the internet is just as good as the portability. and just when you think it may stall (not that its slow at all just low expectations) you see the blue processing line going across the top of the screen like lightning. So far im very much enjoying the tablet.along with this purchase I bought the tech armor anti glare & anti fingerprint screen protector (love it). I recall the reviews being ify but it was a snap for me its a 3 pk comes with a smoother & wiping cloth. I also purchased a silicone skin cover to protect from scratches. I think i will get a case. Its another level of protection it was a life saver for my last tablet. I liked to open in close like a book. One thing I wanted to mention if your looking at your screen and it looks too dark dont worry it auto adjust to your lighting. If the room has low lighting the screen will automatically dim. turn the lighting brighter then the screen gets brighter.  Oh another thing that drove me nuts was wanting to organize or remove apps or delete one of the 3 home screens. To move the apps around hold drag and drop. if you want on another screen hold and drag to either side you'll see a blue line as if turning the page. It'll go to the next screen. To delete apps hold drag and drop to the trash bin. To adjust the home screens while viewing the home screen drag your fingers across screen as if pinching the screen. the screens will minimize and you can drag and drop to the trash bin", "Date": "January 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Depends on what you're looking for...", "Author": "M. S. Raven", "ReviewID": "R2WUAZ0SA1P3FU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this for one purpose - to use a word processor on it so that I could see the text better than on my cell phone screen. I don't need to watch movies or download a lot of content or anything like that, so for me it works just fine. Also, I already own a Samsung phone and had a Google Play account, so it was nice that when it turned on, all my content downloaded and I have everything that I have on my cell phone on here as well in the same Samsung set up that I'm used to.However, it must be said that this device, while nice and all and the size works for me, is not the zippy, high def tablet that you get for doing multiple tasks and downloading loads of things from the internet. It is quite slow loading internet pages, it often stalls if there is more than one program running, some of the widgets took forever to show up on a screen where I put it because I was downloading other apps at the same time. A few of the games I play from time to time, blink a bit with lag time, but I haven't done any heavy gaming. I assume that would be a horrible experience. It also has a tiny memory, so be ready to buy that SD card (nice feature, but these days who wants to spend extra money on an SD card, or have to have an SD card?).Generally speaking, it works fine, it's just not very robust, the screen isn't amazing, the camera isn't spectacular, and the speed is not impressive. But for what I'm doing with it, I like it. The size is great to carry around in a purse, it fits in one hand, typing on the screen is fine (though I've gotten a bluetooth keyboard). If I wasn't using it for just the general text document processing that I am, I would imagine this would only be good for very light tablet use, maybe for young kids that don't play big, high def games, probably great for taking notes in class. Other than those select areas, I imagine this is not what people would want for all the apps and dazzling stuff you get online these days. It's outdated to say the least, but for the price, for select areas, for certain tasks you might want to accomplish, or for very light tablet use, it might suffice.", "Date": "January 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Too big to be a phone, too small to be TV", "Author": "Peter \"Short Bald and Ugly\"", "ReviewID": "R21FM1TE1A5XFF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This unit is Goldilocks sized.

I was also able to import my full iPad contacts list by exporting them using the app, MCBackup Pro, which uses vCard format and emailing them to myself, then importing them from there. Very cool. So far the only downside is that it won't charge from one of my Mophie portable battery packs which i use all the time with my iPhone and iPad Touch. Apparently you must use the included wall adapter.

The Touch pad and side Scrolling work perfectly, it's quick and it's smooth.  The Size and shape is comfortable and the Tablet feels solid.  The Tablet looks good.  The Tablet has a USB port for connecting to your computer.  The Expandable SD Card Memory is a huge plus.Cons: The WI-FI connectivity is far below par. I've taken it to multiple places to ensure it wasn't just my modem/internet.  I even tried a new tablet after that only to experience the same issue.  The Tablet has tendencies to crash when Running apps that require WI-FI after a connection is finally made.  Unfortunately The tablets Browser's (chrome) and (internet) are fairly slow when actually connected.Overall: The Tablet is great for non internet use, But anything requiring internet whether its a download or youtube will often crash the tablet meaning you have to restart it and hope for the best.  The Browsing is slow, as a comparison my Ipod touch which is a (4th Gen) will load web pages and videos more than 2X as fast as this tablet.  I was looking forward to owning one but because of the issues I encountered, I returned it back to the store in less than 24 hours of owning it to get a Refund.

I plugged it in to charge when I got it and didn't get to use it much the first day, only a couple hours of straight use and everything seemed fine. The next day I noticed the WiFi problem some other reviewers mention which weren't on here until after mine was shipped. Almost every time I turned it on or woke it up I had to go in and manually turn the WiFi off then turn it back on for it to connect if I wanted to get online right away. The other times I let it go (if I wasn't getting online right away) it took at least a minute or longer for it to connect, this is with a signal it was saying was very strong. It seems to constantly \"scan\" for WiFi signals, even when it's already connected to one. Even though this was annoying, I was willing to put up with it and hope they could fix it with an update.I downloaded a couple apps and they all seemed to work fine (Netflix and Viggle). Although a couple games I tried (Robot Unicorn Attack 2) ran slow at times and (Major Mayhem) paused once and told me the frame rate was too slow and wanted me to turn down it's graphic settings. Although if you turned off the power saver setting, both of them ran a lot better. A few other games I tried (Candy Crush Saga, Tetris Blitz, Jetpack Joyride) played fine.Google Chrome ran at probably half the speed as the built-in browser. On Chrome a site would take 20-30 seconds to load, the same site loaded in less then 10 seconds on the built-in browser. Though the built-in browser isn't without it's annoyances. One I hated the most, there seemed to not be a password manager in it. If you told it to remember your passwords and you wanted to remove one later, I only saw an option to clear all passwords.Some people may not like it, but I liked the sound every time you \"clicked\" something with the built-in browser, it let me know I actually hit the link. Chrome on the other hand did not have the sounds leaving me wondering if I missed the link or if it was just loading slow like usual. Also, multiple times while online, I would click a link on a site, the site would be loading the next page (on the same site) and give me an error saying something like, that action can not be preformed and finish loading the page... what action it was? I have no idea. It does not support flash and It also froze up once loading a site and I had to hold the power button to get out of it.A couple other annoyances, the setting to automatically control screen brightness constantly made it entirely too dark, I eventually turned it off since it's on by default. Also, In my experience, the camera was too dark. I had to turn the brightness clear up when I tried it. Unless the object had direct light on it, I could not see it.On the 3rd day I started getting the error \"the process com.google.process.gapps has stopped.\" It only seemed to pop up when I opened a browser. There seems to be fixes for this although I didn't look for one at the time because I started getting another error.That other error \"Package File Invalid\" started, which it seems that now Google is looking for a fix for it. The game Jetpack Joyride had an update and I got this error. I thought maybe something was wrong and tried updating it later just to get the error again. I uninstalled the game and tried to install it again, couldn't do it at all. Not knowing if it was just the game or not, I tried downloading another app to see, still get \"Package File Invalid.\" I looked around online for help, found nothing at all on Google Support nor Samsung, although Google may have something now since they are looking for a fix. I found a few Android forums/sites with \"fixes\" none of which worked for me. Cleared cache and data, uninstalled Google Play updates etc. nothing worked.Thinking I maybe did something or an app I downloaded screwed something up, I decided to completely factory reset the thing. I start setting everything up, enter my WiFi, enter my Samsung account, start entering my Google account when I click next it sends me back to the start... OK I set everything back up (WiFi, Google account etc.) when I finish and it loads the OS, I had 14 update errors where it tried updating all the pre-installed apps and couldn't because \"Package File Invalid.\" OK so maybe I did something wrong or when it sent me back to the start something messed it up, factory reset again, this time everything works fine, the OS loads and starts updating. A couple updates go fine, then once again \"Package File Invalid.\" I entered the Play store tried downloading an app \"Package File Invalid\" tried another app \"Package File Invalid.\" Factory reset again to remove all of my information and contact Amazon to return it, thankfully they let me.This being my first Android device, it didn't make a good first impression.", "Date": "August 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Milo", "Author": "Milo", "ReviewID": "R75TDUK1BJZQT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Planning to return it.The two main disadvantage so far are:1.

Which is even more annoying is that the speakers are at the bottom and when you turn the device horizontally to watch with bigger picture you inevitably blocked them with your finger. I don't know how else you are suppose to hold the pad in that position to prevent that to happen. That to me is so stupid and so simple mistake that I don't know how Samsung let that happen.

In 2-3 weeks are coming models that would be the same price range like nexus 7 2 and Asus hd7 that would surpass the tab 3 in every single  dimension, so if you don't rush I would recommend you to wait little more and get different device because I don't think this one is worth it the 200$.

I don't think it is a product that I would have thought to purchase because when we previously looked at it the reviews were not all that great. In fact, my husband purchased the Tab 2 for me instead of this one because the Tab 2 had better reviews (I returned the Tab 2 after less than 15 days for a Note 8, but that is not the point of this review so I will not go into it further for this review). This tablet has been a very pleasant surprise!My husband has not had any problems with this tablet, it is peppy/fast and seems to offer everything that he needs. We added a 32gb card to it so it now has 40gb of memory ($17 investment). He had been using our old iPad (2nd gen) and he is not a tech geek like me, but he seems to really like this device and the size of this device (he has not picked up the iPad since he got this). I tried to set it all up for him before giving it to him and found later that he was enjoying customizing the device himself, which made me happy!We own a lot of tablets and this one fits in with the others quite well. In my opinion it is a much better value than the iPad or iPad mini largely because the operating systems are so similar at this point, the apps are similar and you can add memory to this device, which is something you cannot do on any iPad. Oh and I have found a number of android apps that allow you to sync to itunes for your music and movies and then other apps that allow you to sync to your icloud calendar, contact and to do list.In terms of this versus the other less expensive android tablets that we own the main differences would be how the company (Samsung in this case) sets up the android environment and the fact that this device has a button instead of all touch screen buttons. Overall this is a nice tablet for the price point. If I could change one thing I would have it be 16 gb instead of 8. The 8gb is fine for my husband who does not have a ton of large apps that run better on the device vs the card, but my kids have a lot of kid friendly, high graphic, large memory apps that run better on the device vs the memory card. I think this device would not have been a great choice for my kids.Please note - Android devices generally, with the exception of the Kindle (which does not have a memory slot), cannot play Amazon video. I believe this is Amazon's choice and not the choice of the manufacturers.Here are the similar devices that we own:1. Samsung Galaxy Note 82. Lenovo A30003.

I was hoping the added benefit of having a multimedia tablet for many other would offer a less expensive alternative to an iPad or constantly using my iPhone 4S. I have to say that the only good thing I can speak highly of is that you can load external files on it with a USB cable and/or micro flash card. Other than that, the Tab is slow, unresponsive, crashes apps, does not have a very reactive touch screen, and somewhat nonuser friendly with setup and operation. My daughter has an Apple iPad 1 and that is more responsive and stable than the Tab. This is my first Android device and I can now honestly say I will not depart with Apple's OS for Android.

The stock memory of 8gb can be filled quick because some games can be 1gb in size. But the memory can be expanded easily and not for too much. Performance is good. I am still surprised by the graphics of some games. I just wish I could get or find a gimp or photoshop like app to do graphic designs on the go without having to root or basically hack the tablet. The wifi range is good if you are within your home or the same building as the router but it can get weak when  you are outside. I am looking for a way to boost its signal by maybe using an usb wifi adapter for rasberrry pi like boards and use a usb to micro usb adapter to connect it to the tablet. Should work since rasberry pi uses android and linux like this can but this tablet has to be hacked to root it so you can install linux while it comes with android out of box. I would recommend and buy this tablet again. Battery is about 12 hours with wifi off but with wifi on it can be drained in about 6 hours if you surf the net alot and can be drained even quicker if playing a game with 3d graphics while wifi is on. But with all the usb power adapters on the market I doubt that will be much of a problem for most people. I have two wall power adapters and one car adapter while only spending about 40 us dollars so i can not complain too much about having enough power for my needs.", "Date": "May 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great tablet", "Author": "M.

The only criticism I have is Samsung doesn't tech service doesn't do tech service for their own refurbished product. One of my pet peeves is all this high tech gadgets are great and useful tools , however nobody shows you how to use them or wants to support them. That goes for software and hardware. You have to be technically adept or watch utube videos to learn how to use the brand new high tech stuff you just bought.

I have to shut the wifi off and then put it back on again so it will recognize that it is connected and then I can continue what I was doing. I can't understand why it does this but it is not that big of a deal overall it is a great tablet the same as the Tab 2 was.

During our last update (4.3.1 or some such) the file ended up being corrupted, and we were unable to recover from it.  Samsung was absolutely no help,  since we were out of warranty, they said \"so sorry, can't help you, why not you buy a new one?\"Tried everything under the sun,  system resart, cold booting,  system restore,  and each time it would show the little android guy falling over and saying corrupt files/data.Needless to say we became an expensive paper weight.That's too bad because we cannot recommend any samsung tablets anymore.

Side by side with my kindle fire hd i can barely notice much difference. The tab is not extreme fast but it is not slow either, if you install  a task killer or ram manger , you can keep the ram clear and it will improve your browsing experience. People say it take 3 secs more to open apps, really 3 secs if you cant wait an extra 3 secs, its time to slow down your life.  I test the wifi and it works great the bars are not correct , when iam outside i get one bar but the tab work perfectly still loading pages and loading u-tube, test it yourself u will find even with 1 bar showing the connection is great.This is a perfect tab for movies and emails, the size is quite small and light fits almost perfectly in my pants pocket.  Since the price drop you can find these as low as 149.00 , which is a great price for the tab. The tv remote is great for using the tab to control tv.  Most people make fun or hate samsung touch wiz, but i love it , it has lots of useful features and mekes it easy to use the tablet, i have own the nexus 7 2013 and yes it is faster and smoother, but i like the samsung so much better, with the nexus you have to be very gental as it is very thin I was always afraid the screen would crack.  Like i said if you install a ram manager or task killer and keep the memory clear , you will find the tab work fine, as long as your not expecting it to be blazing fast....

I'm not too concerned about the 8GB onboard memory, because I can install 64GB microSD cards, and have more than is needed.I'm really picky about devices like this, so giving 5 stars is a big deal, but I am really impressed with Samsung.

I didn't check if this device had a Netflix app before buying because I honestly didn't consider the possibility that ANY tablet at this point would be sold without it. In addition, I found the OS for this tablet to be quite slow, and it took a rather long time to load any webpages or attempt to download anything.

Ginkel \"bilobaman\"", "ReviewID": "R9XZNHXHCB8DB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First of all, this is a decent tab.  I like it for what I use it for.  Value wise, it is a 'great success.'  I use it as my car navigation/radio device.  First thing I did was root it (XDA developers is AWESOME).  I left the stock rom on there, but needed root access for the Tasker app to be able to do all the things I wanted it to do.  I use an Akron dash holder to keep it mounted in my car.  When I power on the car, it boots Pandora, Waze, and other apps I want open while driving.  This thing spends 98% of it's time on my dash.  It does all these tasks admirably.  I have no idea how well it will do in the Utah summer heat though.  This is the WiFi model, I use WiFi hotspot from my phone for data while driving.Pros:- Bright screen with decent resolution- Battery life is quite long (even though it is always plugged in while driving)- It's Android rooted, so you can do whatever you want if you know what you are doing- Audio is sufficiently loud (I normally have the headphones plugged in to my aux while driving but sound is good)Cons:- Doesn't do great in the cold, even though I can't expect that; if it's cold, prepare for cold warnings and no charging, sluggish LCD refresh.- Menu/Back buttons don't light up on this 7\" model, sucks when night driving while trying to use it- Camera might as well not even be there, it has terrible resolution and horrible color.  Don't plan on using it for any reason.Overall, for a dash rider, it rocks.  Using Waze, Torque app for car data, Pandora or whatever music app you like, and Tasker seals the whole deal.  This app has a medium learning curve, but once you master it, you can make you phone do just about whatever you can imagine automatically.  8/10 would buy again.  Good for kids too at home with the WiFi.  If it breaks, oh well.  Not $500 bucks down the drain like an Ipad if it gets broken.

I originally ordered the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 and when it was delivered, the packaged was open and the seal on android box was broken.

I was very pleased in how easy the return process was as this was my first time sending a device back. I love the Galaxy tab 3 and it goes well with my Samsung Galaxy S 3 Phone. The Tablet has a beautiful bright 7 inch screen making the handheld experience comfortable. It can fit nicely in my purse. It is easy and simple to set up and use. I ordered the 16 gig because that is all I need for books, music and pictures storage. I love the camera that is front faced too. It is WiFi capable and I am not obligated to sign up with any carrier. I have a kindle but brought this tablet for more extended fun use where I am able to access documents on cloud apps for handling business or school. The camera feature is nice since a IPad was out of the question for me no matter what deal was available. I love Samsung products in their lap top, camera, phone and now I have the tablet. The white color with silver trim is very nice than the normal black color devices out there. I am a satisfied customer. I buy from Amazon on a regular.

Really, I did. I'm a Samsung fan. I own two Samsung phones, a Galaxy Blaze and a Galaxy S III, and I'm very happy with them. The Tab 3 looks like a larger version of the S3 on steroids. Unfortunately, it doesn't perform that way. It's slow doing simple things. For example, there is a noticeable lag when scrolling through web pages. And I don't mean loading pages, I mean scrolling AFTER the page is fully loaded! Move your finger, and for half-a-beat nothing happens, then the page moves. Very irritating, especially since my 18-month-old Blaze scrolls so much faster. This general slowness affects all of the Tab's operations to some degree (for example, when turning pages in a book or reading a pdf file). Even the menu for Settings, while faster than browser scrolling, still lags just a bit. C'mon, Settings is the most basic operation on the device!This slowness occurs even with no background apps running, or in memory.The shape and size of the device is quite pleasing, but the back is smooth shiny plastic with no texture, so it makes the Tab feel like a heavy toy. And the shiny finish magnifies fingerprints and smudges.Aside from slowness, everything works as advertised. But I get a sense that Samsung didn't try very hard when they were designing this device. It lacks vision. It's not revolutionary or evolutionary. The Tab 3 is a familiar form factor housing tech suited to 2011 or 2012 (dual core, 1200 MHz, ARM Cortex-A9 and 1024 x 600 pixels), but seriously out of date in 2013-2014. Ya, it's cheaper than some other tablets. And for this reason it might be a good gift for a child, or a tablet for someone on a very tight budget. But overall, I can't recommend.I kept the Tab for two days and then returned it. Got a Nexus 7 (2013 version), and it performs perfectly.Note that this review is for the WiFi-only version.

I like that.The Google play store doesn't seem to have quite as many good apps as the apple store.Dumping movies on the tab, having them be converted and play nicely is very cool and something I really enjoy, it removes pain in the ass steps that exist in the apple world.When running apps like facebook and ebay, there are moments when the system seems to slow down and need to catch up.  I find this unimpressive for a NEW NEW tablet to have so many slow downs.  There's a smoothness factor to the newer apple products that this simply lacks.  Maybe the 8.0 or 10.2 is better.I find typing on this tablet much better than on the Ipads / Iphones.I find surfing clunkier than on a lot of apple products, it feels like some of my touches just aren't that accurate.Does not weight a lot, but feels a bit cheap/plasticy.Cost me less than half of what an ipad mini costs.Nice for reading.I'm about a month into owning this tablet, and overall I like it, but don't LOVE IT.

One was the 7\" model (for my Granddaughter) and an 8\" (for myself).  Had no problems setting up /connecting either tablet.  My Granddaughter is eight years old and had no problems with any of the controls and is extremely delighted with the size of the screen compared to her iPod Touch. She has downloaded many games and other Aps from Google Play and everything works as advertised.  With that said, there are a couple of features that are present on the 8\" model that I feel should have been included with the 7\".  The first is the ability to transfer some Aps to the SD card.  Some (not all) Aps are developed with this capability and I think that Samsung should have allowed this on the 7\" as it did on the 8\".  The internal memory of the 7\" is half that of the 8\".  The other feature that is available on the 8\" and not the 7\" has been mentioned in several of the other reviews.  It is the ability to control the \"Touch Key Light Duration\".  I think a lot of owners would like the ability to have the lights on for a longer period or all the time.Note: In an attempt to get more information regarding the transfer of Aps to the SD card, I contacted Samsung through their \"Chat\" service.  After listening to my question, and doing some research, the Service Rep informed me that the 7\" Tab 3 had the capability that I was questioning him about.  I told him that there were two identical Aps on each tablet.  I could transfer them on my 8\" but not on the 7\" in spite of both tablets having the same OS.  At that point the Rep said I should contact the developer of the Aps.  Needless to say, that ended \"Chat\".  A week later I decided to call Samsung.  Surprise!  I got to speak to a real life Human!  After a brief conversation and a not so brief \"hold while I research\", I was told \"we don't know the answer but we will forward your question to the Tech Department\".  I was given a transaction number that I'm sure is resting on the bottom of somebody's circular file.

Cupit", "ReviewID": "R1WZ6G31APIEGZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I know that my experience with the Samsung Galaxy will not deter most people from buying one.... As for myself I read plenty negatives reviews on the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 totally ignoring common issues other users had with the product only to purchase it and then discover I would have the same issues that others have expressed.My experience with the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 did not fair well for many reasons. I decided to purchase the Galaxy Tab 3 after hearing good reviews from friends & family bout the Samsung S4 Smartphone.  First issue that I had with the Galaxy Tab 3 out the box is that it will only pick an extra strong WIFI singnal in the same room as my WIFI router. I just purchased the router in recent months and never had issue with WiFi signals with any of our other WiFi enabled products....Smartphones, Laptop computers, etc. Potential buyers can & should confirm this WiFi signal issue with the Galaxy Tab 3 through a Google search on the topic. The Galaxy Tab 3; as with most computers; does auto-updates on the pre-installed applications and also any apps that I install through the Samsung/Google \"Play Store\". My Galaxy Tab 3 was giving me constant error messages when it would attempt auto updates on the applications. Last count I had 26 error messages....when I would clear them out the errors would cycle again. I tried to do the research online though Samsung and Android help forums on this one issue to no avail though it seems to be a persistant problem for many users with application update error -110.  A big negative for the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 is no ADOBE FLASH. This is a bad if like my family you have Amazon Prime as you cannot play movies from the website and there is no app for Amazon Prime movies. This is just a personal issue for me, but I had to create a username and password to use most of the applications pre-installed on the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3. This got extremely frustrating for me as I decided to forgo use of some apps because of this.  Also, when I was able to do a search through Yahoo search engine it was common to get a message alert message saying - \"Too many redirects from search engine\".  Needless to say, I will be returning my Samsung Galaxy Tab 3. Obviously others experience with the Galaxy Tab 3 has been good, but satisfaction would depend on what you plan on using it for.", "Date": "August 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Tablet bad", "Author": "YUSTHYN RUEDA", "ReviewID": "RJXFJOZDKLWIF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "wrong tablet, the tablet just arrived in Venezuela  new but it not works. turns itself off, the tablet will not download apps, amazon and the seller said I can not to accept the return", "Date": "May 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "not a fan of samsung from way back and still standing", "Author": "Wendy", "ReviewID": "R1950HL12M67GZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Let me just say that this was a gift so I did not order personally.  I received this gift in April of 2013 and it no longer works at first they said that the plug or the charger had a short when I called Samsung directly.  I took it into Best Buy and went to the geek squad to find out that it was neither it is the actually tablet itself.  When I received the gift I immediately ordered a leather case for it and a screen protector.  Then they asked me at Samsung if I dropped it.  because they don't understand why the USB port would be damaged so in order to send it to them there is a $34.99 charge and if the USB port has to be replaced which I already told them it did there are additional charges not to mention I have to pay to ship it and for them to return it which will be billed on my credit card.  The warrantee literally expired 16 days after I reported that it would not turn on and to no avail would they honor taking a look at it.  Just like my handbags if you don\u2019t stand behind your product I won\u2019t purchase it I am 40 years old and take very good care of my things however technology is fickle and even though the warrantee expired two weeks before it broke this product should\u2019ve lasted much longer.  I am not a child throwing it around or dropping it.  I don\u2019t even use it at the gym while working out I have a MP3 player that I have had for 3 years and still going strong by Sony.  Needless to say I am replacing this because I do like the tablets and will go with Google Nexus going forward.  Very disappointed yet again with Mr. Samsung.  Hope this review helps the next person purchasing it for themselves or a gift to someone else.", "Date": "May 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good Enough, But No iPad", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"reverendlinux\"", "ReviewID": "R1JMYWVX189FTS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this tablet for two reasons. First as a replacement for my aging Kindle. I loved it, but it was on it's last leg. I wanted something I could easily tote around but could also do more than just read books on. Second, and more importantly, I'm in the IT field and wanted to get some experience with the Android platform. After 60 days of use, here's what I've come to learn about these devices.PROS:- Decent weight. The tablet plus the simple Belkin cover are about the same as a Kindle Fire; easy to hold and use as an e-reader.- Excellent design. The tablet overall has a good layout with buttons in the right place (versus in the way). It looks good and the components used seem to be of excellent quality. Although the casing is plastic, it's thick and doesn't flex.- Clear screen. Some reviews I saw marked this tablet down for having a screen resolution that was lower than competitors and not as sharp. Really, in comparison to other Android tablets I can't see a difference. Streaming movies look to be DVD quality with only slight blurring during action scenes. Colors are sharp. Print is easily legible.- Good performance. On occasion I get lags starting up an application or during use. But overall performance is responsive. I've only experienced a couple of application crashes.- Battery life.  Without the wifi on, the battery goes about a week.  With the wifi on, about two days.  Not stellar, but easy to live with.CONS:- NO ANDROID UPDATES. This is my number one gripe. The thing came with Android 4.1.2 while 4.4.2 was released nearly 5 months ago. I would expect slow or no updates from the bottom feeder tablets like Polaroids. But when you shell out $179 for a product from a company that's going toe-to-toe with king of the hill Apple, you expect a bit more in the way of updates.- Shiny screen. The screen is slick and super shiny. It shows finger prints really easy and is hard to clean. Glare can be an issue sometimes.- Screen responsiveness. The touch screen takes more pressure than it should requiring more of a stab than a tap.- Weak WiFi. The tablet can usually manage only about 3/4 signal strength unless I'm within 15 feet of my wifi router. Although I haven't found any dead spots in my 2-story house, the signal gets weak really fast as you move away from the router.- Camera. Although the rear camera is a decent 3MP, the front camera is pretty weak at 1.3MP.  Additionally, the cameras have no flash.- Crapware.  There's a ton of Samsung apps that I'll never use and no way to delete them (short of rooting it which most folks probably aren't going to do).In summary, this is a good tablet for everyday use and at a reasonable price.  It's met my original two goals of being a Kindle replacement and getting to learn Android. However, in comparison to my daughter's iPad Mini...well, there really isn't any comparison. The Apple (among other things) is more responsive, made of better materials, is regularly updated and has a better wifi range.  In the end, if you're on a budget, go with the Samsung.  If you're not, go with the Apple.", "Date": "May 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "get something else", "Author": "Cen", "ReviewID": "RSZD1K7R653U3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Having owned each generation of galaxy, this iteration is not up to par.

The Tab 3 was my first Android device since I moved from the iPhone.The first thing I didn't like was moving back to a lower-resolution screen after having become accustomed to the Retina displays of Apple products. Next, and this is my biggest gripe, I found the user interface to be clunky and ugly. For example, the idea of program widgets is clever, but they do not blend in well with the overall look of the OS. There seems to be no standard design, it looks mashed together. iOS was much more polished and visually appealing.The way the programs were put into different screens was also annoying. In iOS you have up to X main screen where all the programs are listed. On this device there was a separate screen where all your downloaded programs would be listed, then you would have your \"home\" screens. You had to either make a shortcut from the all-programs screen to one of your home screen or just browse the all-programs screen. Breaking programs up this was seemed completely unnecessary.Having been on iOS now for several years, I refuse to repurchase apps on Android that I already bought on Apple's App Store.", "Date": "October 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice but...", "Author": "Ascaris", "ReviewID": "R20QCQJL4R94Q5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I would have been greatly in love with this tablet had it not been for the capacitative buttons not lighting up.I have the white version.Normally I wouldnt mind little details and I usually love Samsung products. BUT someone dropped the ball big time on this.The tablet is great, its a lot faster and smoother than my Tab 2 7.0 which I love by the way.. Both are small, compact and light weight. Perfect size for me since Im on the move a lot.The new Tab 3 7.0 is even smaller even tho it still maintains the same screen size at7\". And also the memory is upgradable via micro SD.But the most annoying issue I have is that the capacitative buttons dont light up, meaning that if you are in a room with low light, it is near impossible to see where the back button and the menu button are.I thought I would love those button not being on the screen itself but it really gets old when while watching a video or even surfing the web or playing in an app and accidentally hitting one of those button since they are not discernable from the frame.In a well lit up room or outside in a sunny day it isnt such an issue since the buttons are grayish outlined. But in a car or a plane where light can be low the whole thing turn gray and cannot see where the buttons are.Now people might think Im just being too overly negative about this issue but for what I bought this upgrade it just isnt working. I hate it, I HATE IT! Always accidentaly touching these invisible buttons. I would have much rather love for them to just leave them inside the screen.And I cannot even let my 2 year old play with it since she cannot tell the buttons arent there. On the tab2 she can see the those button and the home button since they are on screen and she knows what they do. On this one, she keeps getting kicked out of her apps and she thinks something is wrong with the tablet. She like the tab2 better obviously.And the worst part is that I tried looking up if this was due to a deffective product or the tablet is just made that way and even the rep couldnt give me a straight answer telling me that this tablet is made just like the Note and that the buttons light up but not bright, that it depends on the brightness of the screen. wait WHAT? That doesn't even make sense.Also looked up in the options to see if there was an option to turn those on but nothing.If I had the option, I'd just wait for the Nexus or something else, but if this issue does not bother you, Id definitely recommend it to you. As for me, I will explore my options.Update after 3 days with the Unit:2nd day of use and The unit seems to have issues with Wifi connection. Cannot connect to the Play store, but the web browser works just fine. As of yesterday it will not even connect to the Wifi while my tab 2 gets connection. I will try to do a factory reset and see where it takes me. Also it seems to have a issue when hooked up via Aux cable and there is a loud noise (for exemple an explosion or a shout especially while watching an action movie) the sound messes up and I have to unplug the Aux cable and plug it again. Yeah those are definitly too many issues with my unit.I understand that my review score might be a little too harsh to some, but Again, for what I bought this unit for, it is not serving its purpose so it is useless to me so far.Update After day 5:Yeah my unit is pure garbage at this point. Now it won't even connect to my laptop. It keeps restring or shutting off and just showing the charging battery. I'm done with this, returning the unit and giving it another shot but I'm not hoping for much here.I'm still not happy about the Capacitative buttons, but not much can be done here. The rest I'm sure is either I have a defective unit or its just a software issue that hopefully Samsung can fix with updates.I'm hoping I'm the only one with these issues as the Samsung rep told me he's never heard of the unit underperforming like that.All in all, There is much to like about this tablet, but right now with my experience now turning sour I would have to give it a 0 star.
