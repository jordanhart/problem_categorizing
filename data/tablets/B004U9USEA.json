I can't put it down! Didn't charge it until after two days. It's amazing how light and portable it is. With my commute, it's an excellent device to carry with me. Much lighter than any iPads, Xoom, or any other upcoming Honeycomb devices. The price, well, it's EXCELLENT!! I use it mostly for reading books and browsing. Wherever I go now, there's mostly WiFi, so this is perfect. The screen clarity is AMAZING! Much much better than Motorola Xoom.Galaxy tab feels like a conveniently oversized Android phone, and that is a GOOD thing, because of my familiarity with Android phones. The icons look conveniently big now. Unlike Honeycomb, most applications run great because it's technically a software for phone. Pandora, book reading apps, Pulse, all run great!I'd actually give it a 4.5 star instead of five, just because of some things:- Some apps appear to be stretched, so sometimes it's not that pleasing to the eyes.- Qik doesn't work. This defeats the purpose of including it in the first place.- No video chat for Skype or GTalk. It's not Samsung's fault, but maybe they should nudge Google. After all, they do make a Nexus S for them, which also has a front facing camera.- When connected to a PC, it doesn't charge. What gives?!Other than that, I think this is an excellent device. I hope that Samsung would upgrade this to Gingerbread at some point, and change the charging policy.Do not compare this with an iPad (which I do own). They are completely different in apps and interface. I still don't understand why people keep comparing the two, and always in search of an 'iPad Killer'. iPad is a great product in its own merit, and so is Galaxy Tab 7 WiFi. I'd rather that these manufacturers just make products that perform well, instead of trying to kill others.Update:It does have GPS antenna and it functions well. I did a turn-by-turn navigation yesterday, and it worked perfectly. The trick is, you'd need an internet connection for the map to do navigation. I used a phone WiFi hotspot.The internal memory is 16 gB, and the RAM is 512. It does not come with a Micro SD card but it does have the slot. So if you want to add the storage, you would have to buy your own and put it into the Micro SD slot.I have not tried bluetooth yet. I might try that today.", "Date": "April 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very useful device", "Author": "UncleSam", "ReviewID": "R2B6ME1OCQO3SM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted to wait for Galaxy Tab 8.9, but just decided to get this since I preferred 7 inch screen for more portability reason. This device is just half the size of iPad. I use this device for watching movies I downloaded which are divx, xvid, mkv codec movies. So far, I haven't had any problem playing any types of movie files I have. It even plays .mkv file over 3GB. One thing to clarify on the other review is that connecting to PC USB port actually charges (but slowly) somehow status says it's not being charged. Same thing happen when I connect to an external battery, it slowly charges, but status says it's not being charged.Pros:-you can watch HD video in original format (divx, xvid, mkv, etc) without conversion.-wifi-only version has GPS (unlike iPad). I installed MapDroyd(lets you download maps) for off-line navigation-full support of Flash (so far, no issues accessing flash sites that I usually visit)-SD card slot (for up to 32GB)-comes with ThinkFree office (you can read .doc .pdf, and etc)-you have choice of 3 app stores (Google Market, Amazon app store, Samsung app store) Samsung app for u.s. version has only few apps now, but hope it grows bigger-portable size - you can hold with one hand, and it goes into your pocket-you can connect to any pc to transfer the files (movies, musics, docs, etc) unlike iPad which requires iTunes.Cons:-Reader's Hub is missing somehow.-Proprietary connector instead of mini or micro USB-most of the apps I installed work fine with the resolution, but a few apps are displayed smaller in the center (for example: Engadget app)So far, I'm very happy with the purchase. I own iPad too, but recently I haven't really used iPad because this tablet.

Probably won't be the last, but it left a bitter taste in my mouth.  I ended up returning the Tab after a few weeks with it.  The problems were numerous.1.) This is the most egregious.  The Galaxy Tab Wi-Fi is dramatically lower spec'd than its 3G counterparts.  Therefore, every review you can find online does not apply.  It has an older generation processor (Arm v7 vs. Arm v8), the graphics processor is also a generation behind and dramatically lower in speed (530 vs. the 540).  What does this mean to non tech geeks?  The buttery smooth performance you see in reviews for the earlier Tabs is replaced by slow scrolling in webpages, the homescreen taking several seconds to work when you rotate the device, and games simply not working.  I couldn't believe Samsung would completely cripple the device like this but a casual glance at the product page produces this gem \"features and specifications subject to change without prior notification\".  It is absolutely insane a major tech company has that disclaimer on a product page, and the fact they don't advertise the radical difference between the devices is shameful.2.) Another major consequence is one of the coolest features of the 3G Tabs is not present here, HDMI out.  HDMI out does not work on the Wi-Fi only version.  Probably a result of Sammy putting the Wi-Fi only Tab a generation behind the 3G version.3.) Finally, this really cemented my decision to return it.  I can handle the inferior performance, grudgingly, but I can take it.  I can't handle the fact that this device is Wi-Fi only and it doesn't properly connect to Wi-Fi.  When I first got the device I had trouble connecting it to networks.  After resetting it like 5 times and assigning a static IP address to it, it finally randomly worked.  Then, after a couple of weeks and no change on my part I got the same connection problems!  Now, after a few more resets, I finally had it.  Less you think its just me, google Galaxy Tab Wi-Fi problems and marvel at how widespread they are.Simply put, Samsung is launching new tablets next month (June 8th), and they've clearly given up on the current Tab despite it launching only a couple of weeks ago.  Save your money and wait, I promise you this device will only bring frustration.", "Date": "May 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Tablet For Reading", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "R3HEMUQ7PZL3BE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just received the Galaxy Tab WiFi yesterday and so far I'm very happy with it.  It was easy to set up, preloaded with a lot of useful apps, and generally intuitive when learning how to navigate around it.I'm mainly going to read books and surf the Internet.  It does this flawlessly.  The display is bright and clear.  It is also highly responsive to touch (on par with Apple's products).  This is so important.  I realized this awhile ago when I purchased a Cruz tablet.  It was a chore to navigate the device because the touchscreen was not very good.I bought the Galaxy Tab WiFi because of the 7\" form factor.  I think it's great for reading and surfing the web.  I've been reading a book with the Kindle app over the past day and it works beautifully.  It's not tiring at all to hold the Tab and the text is crystal clear.  And jumping on the web is a breeze.  The processor has no problem quickly moving from page to page, pulling up photos and graphics with ease.  And I haven't brought it out of the house yet, but I will.  It's perfectly sized for travel.There is still a ton of stuff I can do with the Tab that I haven't tried yet.  I'm new to the world of Android (I sent the Cruz tablet back after a day) so I'm still getting my feet wet.  It really is a fun product with plenty of entertainment value.  It is definitely worth the money.  It may be a bit more than some of the other 7\" WiFi tablets, but it is a high quality product with a solid build.I've mainly used Apple products up until now.  I have an iPhone and have had an iPod Touch.  Both are wonderful devices.  I used those in conjunction with my Kindle for the majority of my reading over the past few years.  I'm transitioning away from Apple, though. They're threatening to force Kindle sales to go thru iTunes if you buy a book while in your Kindle app on your Apple device.  Apple would then get a cut of the sale.  There are all kind of potential repercussions to this new policy (Higher prices, Kindle app being removed from Apple devices, etc).  As a supporter of Amazon and huge Kindle lover, I'm not going to be part of that.  It made buying the Galaxy Tab WiFi an even better idea for me.", "Date": "April 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good for basics, outdated already. Reliance on Samsung shady...", "Author": "AJ Runner \"ajrunr\"", "ReviewID": "R3F2OMGD0JTVDU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This tablet is fine for basic users. Email, web, news, kindle.If that's all you want and you desire this size of tablet, this is a good option. Just know that this is basically it, and it probably won't be updated.This feels like a rushed out version so that Samsung could compete with the ipad 2. Specs aren't top of the line (obviously to make it cheaper $$).But, it still works.--- The Good ---- Size (if you don't want a 10\")- Battery Life: No complaints, easily goes a day with solid use- Screen: beautiful and nice- Touch Response: seems good to me- SD Card- Swype--- The OK ---- Android 2.2: Not made for tablets, but is usable here (for basic users).- Android Software: If you are an apple (pad, phone, etc) user, this is a step back. I'm an iphone guy and this takes a while to get use to. Part of it is Android, part of it is Samsung and the tablet. I think you need to be a bit more techie to use Android.- Browser: basic, not great.- Text selection: sometimes it works....other times it doesn't. Doesn't work at all in the native email app.- Weight: It's not much lighter than an ipad.- Apps not full screen: a lot of apps are made for the phones, not the tablets which use the same software- Cameras: not great...probably close to bad actually.- Screen rotation: not immediate, but not awful- Overall speed: not terrible in response time, but really not great. Not snappy for sure. And unless they get a better OS (2.3 or 3.0) this isn't going to get better.--- The Bad ---- Specs: CPU, GPU, OS not top of the line. In that sense, it's outdated already.- Lack of support from Samsung- Most likely future lack of support from Samsung. With their new tablets coming out, this will likely not be supported much. Will it ever get Android 2.3 or 3.0 (Honeycomb)? This is a huge, question. And honestly, if this is a big deal for you, skip this tablet. It won't likely happen. Just my guess though. (again, people can put things on their tablets, it just violates the warranty)- Lower specs than the 3g version. They don't mention that, but the GPU is older and slower than the 3G version. But Samsung doesn't really tell you that.- Native email app: No cut and paste (seriously). Email app is clunky and many 3rd party ones aren't much better. The Gmail app is ok, not great.- Installed Apps can't be deleted. The WSJ app is installed, which you need a subscription to use. But you can't delete it. And it can access the internet and system logs whenever it wants to. How ethical is that? What is it doing? Who knows, but I don't like that. I find that a big issue for me.- Start up logo and sound: Annoying and no way to shut it off (without Rooting)- Apps that don't work for this tablet: others talk about this in better detail, but they restrict apps for this particular tablet- No Netflix (an Android thing). Boo.I you want a 7\" tablet, are going to use it for very basic things and are ok with the \"As-Is\", this is a good option. If you want this to root it, play around and possibly improve on it, it's good. And the \"developer community\" likes to make things available. So...there's that.I'm on the fence about this tablet. Not sure if I'll return it.7\" is definitely what I want in a tablet. I'm getting used to Android and really like certain things about it. Love Swype.Best advice: If you can wait, wait.

First off, I am an older individual-leave it at that.  So when i read/see anything about rooting and tinkering I go into panic mode.  The Samsung Tablet is truly a piece of art and highly functional.  Are the instructions the best-definitely not as you have to go online to get them then use a magnifying glass to figure out what they say.  BUT...if you read them, then most of your frustration goes away.The Syncing to computer and my smartphone was a little bit of a challenge.  Sure..Sure if i had first read the instructions this just might not have been an issue but since I didn't I was able to work through it and get both paired and syncing.  Took about 10 minutes to figure each out.The CPU is truly fast.  Pages load quickly and the pinch/zoom is fantastic. Setting up all your accounts takes minutes.  I read in the forum the screen shuts off  after a few seconds  But-again...IF you first just go to settings and select your preferences then most of the problems go away because ..yes...wait for it.....because you control your taste and settings.  Life is down right snappy.The cameras are functional but you wouldn't want to take those Sunday best photos.  QIK..which is a video chat icon is installed but as of yet there is no video chat icon.  When you click on the icon it tells you the update will be coming soon to a theater...oops..lost myself , it will be coming soon.  SAMSUNG-AMAZON...it better be because it's advertised as so.Virtual keyboard is really impressive and responsive.  The voice search works well and had few errors.  I downloaded Amazonapp store and use the ANDROID Market icon to shop for apps.  Huge selections on both and so many free I wanted to cry.  I've read some say the apps are small on the screen.  I've yet to download one that is smaller.  All are clear, sharp and responsive to my touch.  Much more enjoyable on this 7inch screen then my smartphone 4.3 inch.Reading books from the kindle app after syncing all my books for free is a pleasure. You of course can choose whatever reader app you want.  My personal choice is still to use my kindle as it still seems lighter but the point, yes there is one, is that you can read any book on this tablet as if you had your paperback with you, minus the destruction of zillions..and yes..zillions is a word-of trees.I synced all my photos, music and videos from my computer onto the tablet via usb.  The internal storage is 16gb...and i purchased a 16 gb card.  Even after 400 songs, 5 videos and too many photos to count....the internal storage had 8gb left.  I then went into settings, applications and moved the songs over to the sd card and still have about 20gbs left for internal and sd card.  Mind you this too is after I download over 30 apps and switched what i could of these onto the sdcard.So here is the windup....in a perfect world the Video Chat will be actually installed.  The instructions would be clearer and the cameras updated.  Using bluetooth would be easier if explained better.Viewing utube, movies and clips online from any site is near-perfect.  No sputters and stops.  The screen is crystal clear and sharp. You have a great portable, lightweight computer, WIFI system,ebook reader, music and radio player, camera and recorder plus a long lasting battery.  I used the navigation system but found my smartphone was a better choice for me.  It works well and I refuse to pay $50 for a holder just to use it in the car.The tablet is well made and solid.  Buttons are places within easy reach.  I bought a sdcard, fitting protection case, a device I can put the tablet on so I don't have to hold it and a good screen protector.  End of my expenses.

I have been decided between this and the Ipad, but this won me over for a few reasons: Camera, weight and size (definitely didn't want some big 10\" tab to walk around with, might as well just use my laptop) android market, major difference, I'm just floored with the amount of content there is on there and a good amount is free! LinkedIn is awesome and this app called US Route 66 (I think that's the spelling) is amazing...there is no way you can browse all these apps...just mind blowing.There is no reason to even say you can't find something you like.

There is simply no screen in the 7\" range of tablets that is better than the Samsung Galaxy Tab. The viewing angles are terrific and the reason I purchased it.- The size. In my opinion, the 10.1\" is simply too big and screams \"look, I have a tablet!\" The size is perfect for use as an e-book/reader, akin to a Kindle.Con's- The firmware is not upgradeable. This is what it says when you connect it to your computer and sync it using the Kies software. This means you're pretty much stuck with the old Froyo Android OS. This wouldn't be too big of an issue until I found out that...- There is no support from XDA developers. Not only does this model not get support from Samsung but there is no support from the custom roms community as well. The only custom roms out there are for the P1000's models which are the ones being sold by the phone carriers.- Wifi issue. This is a known issue with the wifi model. For some reason, these don't play well with N routers. I've had to set my router to send out only G and B signals. As I mentioned before, Samsung does not support this tablet and has no fix for this.All in all it's a serviceable tablet. You can surf, check e-mail, play angry birds, watch youtube etc. but with the lack of support from Samsung, I cannot recommend this to anyone. This is only my second android tablet and it certainly will be my last.

The processor and the specs are *DOWNGRADED* for the WIFI version.* The process is not the faster/better Hummingbird as advertised, it is an older/slower Cortex processor* It is advertised as Bluetooth 3.0 - it is only BT 2.x* The included Video Chat application Qik does not work at all!!I spoke with a technical service rep two minutes ago, and he confirmed all of this. So, you are not getting the product that Amazon is advertising BEWARE!  Please note: I am not faulting Amazon here.  I believe the fault lies with Samsung for providing factually incorrect information to Amazon.From the specs on Amazon's Galaxy Tab WIFI page:*1 GHz Samsung Hummingbird processor speeds up everything*1.3-megapixel front-facing camera for video chat*Next-generation Bluetooth 3.0 connectivity provides faster throughput while minimizing on power requirements. It's compatible with new Bluetooth 3.0-enabled devices as well as backward compatible with older Bluetooth-enabled peripherals such as headsets and printers.The WIFI Galaxy Tab fails all three \"spec items\" from the product page!-----------------First, I would give this 1.5 stars for non-technical oriented people.  For \"techies\" it's a good-4 star product.Great:* Size.  I wanted this size.  Not many 7 inches to choose from.  Unlike an iPhad or XOOM, this device you can comfortably hold in one hand.  That is very nice.* Screen.  Extremely nice.  Bright in daylight, crisp* Power.  I do long bike rides of 7+ hours.  Using my sweet Verizon MiFi device, and this, it lasts all day long with the GPS and WIFI on.  I occasionally turn on the device to use it when I hear the notification.  I wouldn't take it with me, but on long rides, I do need to stay in touch with my clients.  This thing excels, based upon my personal experience, at power management.* Speakers.  Wow!  Much better than any Netbook or Notebook computer I have ever had.Sweet:* Flash.  Sorry, iPhad users.  Too many websites still rely on Flash for better or worse.  I can browse the complete  web with this thing (except Hulu because of their own crippling of their site on Android).  Also, I get to watch Colbert Report and the Daily Show without a single glitch using my installed Opera Browser.* Video.  It does a decent job at making 720p videos.  For the past 60 days, I was getting excited about buying the ASUS Transformer, but the video quality based upon Engadget review (and others), is AWFUL!  So, since I need to use it to make videos occasionally, this disqualified the Transformer for me completely.  The Galaxy Tab does a good competent job at videos and photo.  It's not great, but good enough.Weight.  Since I have to take this thing with me when I go out for long bike rides, the weight is just at the top end for me, at one pound.  The size and weight of an iPhad or a 10-inch Android device would be a bit too much for me (those are around one and a half pounds).Okay:* Speed.  It ain't a desktop.  Sometimes very sluggishBad:* Android (2.2.x) - clunky to navigate* The unit has \"frozen\" on me several times.  I had to hold the power button down until it shuts off. Then do the same for it to come back on.I have been holding out for a good MeeGo tablet.  It looks like I still have a few quarters to wait.  Also, I am a web developer, and I needed a device like this to validate our work.Side comment... for years \"Linux\" has been bashed for being \"too hard\" to use.

When I bought a Samsung Galaxy Tab I thought I was just sticking it to apple because, as my henchmen know, I dislike apple, despite its long track record of evil. Little did I know that this little device would serve me far better than I had imagined. I brought it with me to work, because anything to distract me from the ceaseless tedium of dealing with the mediocrity of having a \"day job\" (even we Supervillains must pay the bills sometimes) is welcome. Thanks to free cafe wifi (and the kindness of strangers), I was able to use the Tab to its full extent, even away from home.Initially I only expected to use the Tab occasionally. You know, emailing last-minute plot changes to my henchmen, or gloating on twitter after some nation gives in to my demands (some countries aren't aware that my orbital laser isn't functional yet). But I find myself doing more and more with it every day. Then I noticed (much to my surprise) that since buying my Galaxy Tab I hadn't used my laptop in 2 days. I was intrigued, to say the least. I decided to make this a full-blown experiment. I would give it 3 more days and see how I felt about my new acquisition. I'm even writing this review using Thinkfree Office on my Tab.Before I hand down my final verdict, here are a few of my findings:Pros- Great screen, responds well to touch, fast enough to impress, easy wifi setup, good speakers, comprehensive personalization options, voice command sensitivity that is spot-on, and a minimal learning curve.Cons- It's a tiny bit slow to rotate between landscape and portrait modes (a minor annoyance), and the home screens don't wrap around like the app list does (easy to work around, though).So, to sum things up, I find the Tab to be a most impressive handheld device, and a valuable asset to any Supervillain fortunate enough to have one. If you've ever wanted a portable brain (or ANOTHER portable brain if you're THAT kind of mad scientist) then this tablet is for you.

Truong \"El Duke\"", "ReviewID": "R3NTSPOJCWWTIO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This review was originally written for the 7\" Galaxy Tab for T-Mobile. I figured it was just as pertinent for the wifi only version. Pretty much the only difference being that the wifi only version can't have a data plan with a phone carrier.I've had my T-mobile Galaxy Tab for a few months now and have had enough time to gauge how it compares to other tablets available now. Although the 7\" Galaxy tab (the original, not the new 10\" ones that just came out) was one of the very first mainstream tablets that came out, it is still surprisingly one of the best tablets out there... definitely considering it's price range. It is not obsolete and for those who do not need the latest, cutting edge tablet on the market, it should be more than sufficient for your needs. Some things that make this tablet great (that you may not realize) is how sturdy it is built. It's screen is made of \"gorilla glass\" which is glass that is specially tempered to make it virtually unbreakable. The body (chasis) feels really well built and sturdy too. Another thing that sets it apart is the gorgeous screen. The screen is pretty high resolution for it's size, has great contrast ratio which makes the colors pop, has great color reproduction (can display a huge gamut of colors), and is vibrant and very bright. I hardly have the brightness setting at the highest setting because it is too bright! In fact, it looks bright at half the brightness setting. Other things that make it a great tablet is the ability to use it as a wifi only tablet (no cellphone company service needed), micro-Sd expansion slot, great capacitive touch screen, swype keyboard functions, and blue-tooth functions. The advertised battery life of up to 7-hours is actually a reality too. It can actually be much longer if you primarily use it as a web-browser too.The 1ghz processor is actually pretty darn fast. I know there are dual-core tablets out there now, but the 1ghz processor on this thing can handle most anything. Unless you are using a very detailed 3D intensive app, the processor doesn't show any signs of slowdown. I haven't really run into an App or game that it struggles to run. It runs the 3d racing game Asphalt just fine and HD video runs very smooth too. I would've liked there to be a HDMI video out port on it, but I'm not really sure how much I'd use it even if it was on it. All in all, I have very little bad to say about this tablet. It would be nice if Samsung made it easy to upgrade to the latest Android OS... I'm still running 2.2 which was pre-installed.NetFlix!!!:One of my complaints before was that it doesn't run \"Netflix\" but this is no longer a problem. You can indeed run \"Netflix\" on your Tab... and it doesn't even have to be \"Rooted\". Just google for the andriod program/setup file called \"com.netflix.mediaclient-1.apk\", download it to your computer and move it somewhere onto your Galaxy Tab. Then using any free file explorer program (available from android market) you just select the file and install on your Galaxy Tab (from your Tab).Here are some quick Pros and Cons for reference:Pros:-Very well built and sturdy (including screen made from \"Gorilla Glass\"-Bright and Vibrant Screen. Looks as good as the screen on the iPad 1 in my opinion.-Nice portable size and very light-expandable micro-sd slot. Very easy to move files to and from the Tab... copy and paste from computer using windows!-1Ghz processor works great for most of your needs... I haven't had a 3D game it couldn't run yet.-Video runs really well, even HD files. It plays Divx native so just drag and drop on to the tab and it plays it!-Up to 7 hours of battery life as advertised! Very nice when you're stuck on a long flight and wanna watch more than one movie!-You can use it as a wifi only tablet, no need to get service through T-Mobile.. or Verizon for that matter (see notes below)-Nice Mp3 player interface. I like the default pictures it uses when you don't have cover art.-Capacitive touch screen works great, and Swype keyboard works awesome too!-Built-in Blu-tooth, GPS, and Wifi! I had a Blu-tooth keyboard at one time and it worked great on the Tab.-Runs Netflix Now! See section on Netflix (above) if you missed it!Cons:-No HDMI port. This would be nice but ultimately I don't think most people would even use it.-No dual-core processor. This would be nice for very 3D graphic intensive games and better multi-tasking, but not really a must-have.Conclusion:As you can see, the positives greatly exceed the negatives. This tablet was designed, conceived, and built well. That's why it is still a great tablet even when compared to the new tablets out on the market now which have dual-core processors and HDMI output ports. I noticed that the new 10\" Galaxy Tabs no longer have an micro-SD expansion port like these 7\" Tabs do. Keep all of this in mind before you buy a Tablet. In my opinion, this tablet is the best bang for the buck without sacrificing quality, reliability and sturdiness. If you are looking for a high quality and relatively affordable, Non-Apple tablet, look no further... this is it.Notes:If you have a T-mobile Tab, you can always use it as wifi only without getting service. For those of you who have a Verizon Galaxy Tab. When you reset the Verizon Galaxy Tab, it will prompt you to \"Activate\" it with Verizon before you can use it. I'm sure there are those of you who want to use it as a \"Wifi only\" Tablet without having to spend money to \"activate\" it. There is a trick you can use to by-pass the activation process and not have to go through Verizon. It's very simple... here it is:Turn the Tablet on, On the Volume rocker on the right side... hit up ONCE, down TWICE, up THREE times, and lastly down FOUR times. It will then ask if you want to bypass activation. After the process, you should be able to use it as a wifi only tablet. You can always add service with Verizon later! I didn't come up with this trick, I am merely sharing it with you here!I hope this review is helpful... if it is, any feedback is welcome.

This model P1010 WiFi is stripped down, it has a lessor CPU, graphics processor, GPS and bluetooth. Those are four pretty major aspects, additionally it does not work with many accessories such as the RCA out cables so you won't be able to watch videos on a TV. All that said, it is still a very solid OK product. Performance is OK, and the features are basically OK, but the lack of accessory support that the P1000 model has is a MAJOR drawback.That said, I do use it often for many tasks, but it is laggy compared to the 3G version and it was a major let down to discover just how much Samsung crippled it.  I'll still get a lot of use out of it, but I would not buy this device again and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone either.", "Date": "May 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Samsung Galaxy Tab 7 (WI-FI only)", "Author": "tigerrawr", "ReviewID": "RHTQAEWAMRQH0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered the galaxy tab a few days ago. It came in within 2 business days. Prior to purchasing this I did allot research and read allot of reviews on it. So, I had high expectations on this product. A few things in the research that stuck out to me are the difference in Wi-Fi only and the contract ones. Yes they do have different specs but not by much. It does freeze for like a few seconds if u confuses it. It doesn't take 5 mins for the SD card scan it took mine 3 mins to scan 23 GB of media. I say that pretty fast and it is there to check for viruses to protect the device. So no one should really care about it they should be happy about that feature. I was also worried about the battery in all the review it didn't see anything mentioned about the battery. So I tested it. I didn't charge it till I died from the time I got it out of the box to the time it got to 9% in that time it was on from 9pm to 6pm the next day. When I opened it I turned it on and began to set it up. After I was done I downloaded an app to show me the exact percent for my personal experiment I noticed it from the time I turned it on it wasn't a full battery. So, as soon as I could I was done setting it up I downloaded a battery app. According to the battery app from the box you get 80% battery. I used it a lot like I would normally maybe more just to know how long I have on it. I personally got in 2.5 hours of internet, 2 hours of audio, 4 hours of video, 1 hour reading, .5 hours of 3d game play and 11 hours idle time. That's a pretty good battery life.I love this device I would recommend it to anyone because even though it has a few negative it a really good product and there is no such thing as a perfect product because you can't please everyone. I say Samsung did a great job. Also, all the people who were mad about the difference do research before buying anything. Find out which one is best for you, look at them all, this product could have not been for you or they are tech-nerd who will not every be happy with any product because of too high expectations.

I had been shopping for an ereader comparing products and software.  I even purchased a Literati by Sharper Image.  The KOBO software and bookstore was user-friendly but the device itself was terrible.  Difficult to use, (tiny keys on the keyboard) and the battery went dead in about an hour.  Now, my task was even more difficult because I had purchased books from this bookstore that would only work with this software.  I wanted a reader that also worked with digital library editions.  The Kindle is working on this but is not there yet. I was going to buy a Nook color because I liked the touch screen and the way that magazines look on that device but then I couldn't buy titles from my beloved Amazon.Enter the Samsung Galaxy Tablet!! Not only can I read books from KOBO, Amazon, Barnes and Nobels and Borders but I can also get digital library editions. I can even listen to audio books. My digital reading experience varies due to the features of the various software but device works wonderfully.  I didn't want to pay for a monthly data plan so I only have wi-fi which works fine if I am at home, at work, at a library, restaurant or hotel.

Miller", "ReviewID": "RW10LJ2S1J5DN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased the Samsung Galaxy Tab Wireless as a cheaper alternative to an iPad. I also liked the size of the unit and the micro SD card slot allows me to decide how much storage I want.  I still use my Galaxy Tab everyday however there are many annoying deficiencies that keep this unit from being a great tablet. Most of these problems could be fixed via a software update from Samsung. In short, this feels like a unit that was rushed to market (like many Samsung products) and left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I would probably rate this 2.5 out of 5 stars if I could. I gave it 3 because 2 was a little low.The Good:- The screen is absolutely gorgeous! It is very bright and the colors are vivid. Probably as good if not better than my wife's iPad.- Battery life is fantastic. I get about 8 hours of battery life and that is while watching videos, surfing the web and playing games. Although not as good as an iPad, 8 hours is very respectable for a unit this size.- Size is great! As I mentioned, the size of the unit is what attracted me in the first place. I didn't really want a tablet with a 10 inch screen. This fits the bill nicely.- I can upgrade the storage when I want. With iPad you have to choose how much space you want at the time of purchase. After that you are stuck with your decision. With this unit I can add a 32gb Micro SD card anytime I want.- Built in task manager. Hold down the home key and you can start the built in task manager. Sweet.- Fast (once booted up). I haven't experienced any slowdowns with this unit. It seems to run everything I have thrown at it very well.- Status bar is awesome. You pull the status bar down from the top of the screen and you can adjust the screen brightness, toggle wireless, GPS, Bluetooth and orientation lock on or off. I wish my phone had this!The Bad:- No Bluetooth HID support. For some reason, Samsung decided to disable Blue Tooth HID support on this unit. This means no blue tooth keyboard or mouse support. I am baffled as to why they did this. If you buy the same unit from Sprint (with 3g) it has Bluetooth HID support.- Calendar. The built in calendar will sync wirelessly FROM Google but not TO Google. This means that a calendar entry created on the Galaxy Tab will not show up on your Google calendar. Highly irritating if you have multiple devices that sync with google. (You can sync if you connect it to your PC and run Samsung Kies software)- Camera. First the camera doesn't have auto focus. Come on, my last 2 phones have had auto focus and you can't add that feature to a $350 tablet? Also, you cannot shoot video from the front facing camera. This makes no sense to me what so ever.- Does not charge when connected to a PC unless the tablet is powered off.- Many apps don't show up in the market because this unit is wireless only and doesn't have a \"carrier\". This is probably more directed to the Android Market but it is highly frustrating that certain applications don't show up for download simply because my Galaxy Tab is Wireless only.- Media Scanner Sucks! If you put any music or pictures on your SD card, be prepared for about a 5 minute wait before you can actually use your Galaxy Tab. Samsung has this service called \"Media Scanner\" and it can literally take 5 or more minutes to scan your SD card. This means that any applications stored on the SD card will not show up in the apps menu until the scan is finished. Seriously even if you only copy a single picture to the SD card, media scanner runs a complete rescan of the SD card. Since I have about 5gb of music on my SD card this takes forever!- Boot up time is ridiculous.  It takes 45 seconds to reach the home screen. It takes an additional 35 to 40 seconds before you can access the apps screen due to the media scanner. One minute and 20 seconds for a Tablet to boot? My windows 7 laptop boots faster!Final Word:I personally would not have purchased this tablet if I had known what I know now. Unfortunately for me there were not many reviews out there at the time I purchased it. I discovered these shortcomings over a period of about 2 months and now I am stuck with it. If you can live with the limitations I mention above, then maybe this tablet is for you. As for me this will be my last Samsung product. I now own 3 of their products and each one has problems that seem to stem from their strategy of rushing products to market with the intention of \"fixing it\" later.Caveat Emptor!", "Date": "August 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Limited Android Market", "Author": "D.

From the outside it looks the same, but the inside is different.  I tried to load many different Android Apps and about half of them said that it was not a compatible device.  For example:  XM Radio, Fandango, Alarm Clock, Windows Live Chat are just a few Android Apps that will not load on the Wifi Tab.  They work on the 3g Tab, but not the Wifi only Tab.  Talked to Customer Service at Samsung and they confirmed that the Wifi Tab is limited and can not be upgraded.  I really wanted this to work, but am forced to send it back since it was not what I expected.UPDATE May 15:  Got the Verizon 3G Galaxy Tab and LOVE it.  I had to get a 2 year sevice data plan for $20 per month, but the Tab only cost $199.  This one is FASTER, GPS is better.  Bonus is I can use the Tab as a wireless hot spot.  So other family members can use the wifi only Apple products while we are on the road.  We are more of and email, and lite Internet users so the 1GB data package is just right for my family.  Another bonus is the Tab has a phone number (no voice calls) so you can text message for 20 cent pre message or add a texting plan.  I also discover that Windows Live Messanger can handle text messaging, so now I am connected to that sevice).  Overall:  5 stars for the 3G Tab and 2 stars for the wifi only Tab (now that I know what was missing). By the way, this is a Great GPS if you have a big enough data package.  You can always upgrade your data package so start small and see what you really need after the first month.  The local V store had the best prices.

I am placing the same review under each model I tried.Background - I am now 65 - NOT a member of the electronic generation! I love playing Scrabble and thought intensive games in general. I know very little about smart phones or tablets.  I firmly believe that a company OWES SUPPORT to their consumers and NOT at additional cost! Customer service is VERY important to me! Before anyone accuses me of bias: I have NO connection to ANY of the companies mentioned. I am simply a consumer relating my personal experiences!iPad - first generation - EVERYTHING you do with it is tied to iTunes.  When I tried it, there was absolutely NO manual or documentation available for iTunes.  Beyond the first 90 days Apple wants to charge for tech support.  I found iTunes and the Apple OS to be confusing and difficult to use.  The tablet, itself, performed well but I prefer an OS that allows direct folder and file access.Samsung Galaxy 7 inch tablet first generation. This device runs Android 2.3. It is now several years old and STILL functions perfectly. The battery still holds an all day charge with moderate usage. I have never found an app that is \"incompatible\" with this model. This is an important point in the reviews that follow. I even used it to shoot surprisingly excellent videos of a music/dance presentation in a dimly lit auditorium.  Now, several years later, with cataracts growing in both eyes as well as \"floaters\" in both eyes, I was seeking a screen larger than the 7 inch.Motorola Xoom 10.1 tablet. It is HEAVY. While it worked well, for reasons unknown to me it was not compatible with several of my favorite apps. Furthermore, the screen seems to get greasy very quickly!Asus TF300 Transformer 10.1 inch tablet.  While the construction of mine was solid, all the other negative observations of other reviewers were immediately apparent. The tablet would not maintain wi-fi contact even close to my router. The Asus TF300 was also incompatible with many of my favorite apps. Finally, the Asus TF300 (and TF700 mentioned below) has a strange auto-spelling correct system that FREQUENTLY screwed up my typing. To their credit, Asus did answer my question with instructions on how to turn the spelling correction off, but only via email. They have NO telephone tech support.Samsung Galaxy NOTE 10.1 inch tablet. While it offers a pull out writing stylus AND a rear facing autofocus camera, I saw little difference between it and the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 table discussed below.  At roughly $200 more than the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet, although it performed well, I did not feel it was worth the difference in price.Asus TF700 Transformer Infinity -  suffers many of the same problems as the less expensive TF300 model. SPASTIC OS, intermittent wi-fi disconnection. The auto-brightness control also appeared not to work or not to work properly. Perhaps worst of all, possibly because of the increased resolution (the improved resolution was NOT apparent to MY eyes - it appeared to me about the same as all the other tablets) the device is incompatible with MANY apps!Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet.  It performed as well as my first generation Samsung Galaxy 7 inch tablet until I tried to download the QuickMark app to scan bar and QR codes. According to the app developer, the app is incompatible with the tablet because the tablet does NOT have an \"autofocus\" rear facing camera.  A phone call to Samsung tech support, and YES - Samsung BELIEVES in customer support at no extra charge, confirmed the absence of autofocus in the rear facing camera!  Since  I do NOT carry the tablet with me when I go shopping and am NOT likely to scan Bar or QR codes often, I felt I could live without the autofocus rear camera.  However, I did find a different QR code app that DOES work on the tablet.  I have now had the tablet for a week and am loving it. SO FAR, I have not found any incompatible apps other than QuickMark. I find the screen to be bright and sharp (auto brightness works well), and the contrast to be superb. I have used it to watch Big Bang Theory via the TBS app. The Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 inch tablet maintains strong wi-fi connection both anywhere in my home and at the school where I attend classes. Other than the lack of autofocus in the rear camera and the lack of direct USB connectivity without their proprietary cable (sadly, this lack of standardization is still common amongst tablet manufacturers), I have absolutely no complaints at this time.IF you do not need or can live without a rear camera that autofocuses (it DOES have a rear camera and a front camera for SKYPE and other functions), I highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet. At the current price of $300 for the wi-fi 16GB model (memory is expandable through a micro SD card. I see no need for a 32GB model), it is VERY reasonable! I think there are also cell phone service compatible models at additional cost.Advice to tablet shoppers:1 - Buy from a source that allows easy returns without restocking fees. Amazon is EXCELLENT for their customer service, but you may want to buy from a local store to avoid shipping time and costs. Buy from a source that does NOT charge a restocking fee AND allows a reasonable time for device trial.2 - Download as many apps that are free and that look appealing to you. Try each one at least briefly.  NOTE any apps that are not compatible with the tablet you are testing. How important are they to you?3 - Look at each screen under bright and dim lighting. How do YOU find the brightness (usually adjustable, if auto-brightness does not work well for you), the contrast, the sharpness?4 - Log into your email account and/or create a Gmail account. Type an email to someone. Does the auto spelling correct work well for you? Is the virtual keyboard suited to your style and needs?5 - Play with the tablet for a whole day, if you can afford the luxury of sitting with it on.

I missed out on the Touchpad feeding frenzy but happened to catch this one on sale for less than $300 here on Amazon. This is my first android device and I love it, tons of apps and very simple and easy to use. I am very happy with the device so far (2 weeks plus). My first run in with samsung, I tried to register the product, their website kept telling me I had an invalid serial number, I tried doing an online chat with a support rep whose engrish was not so good. She said she was going to transfer the chat to another rep and after 10 minutes, I disconnected. I finally got the product registered by choosing a different model number; GT-P1010CWAXAR. That number is listed nowhere on my device, in or on the box anywhere but apparently, that's what it is. I had quite a bit of difficulty getting samsung's \"Kies\" program to be able to see my device on the computer and again contacted them. The device driver just would not load in windows 7. Again, the agent transferred me because they know nothing about the device, this time however, someone actually came on in a reasonable amount of time. This person wanted me to find another machine, XP or vista to try it on. When I told him I did not have one he told me he was unable to help me and refereed me to a telephone number. Samsung has NO DRIVER FILES, you have to install their Kies software. I finally did get the driver to load by installing the OLDER version of Kies (2.0.0.11024_34). If not for the runaround, pointless and futile exercise with samsung support, I would have rated this much higher.", "Date": "September 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Easy to use, Nice and Portable", "Author": "Organist, Singer, Tiger \"Trey W.\"", "ReviewID": "R3SBVV62LYUG29", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This product is really great. The android operating system is very easy to use, and there are plenty of apps to download. The downloading process is extremely simple. There are a couple of apps that are unavailable (at the time of this writing), but it's not really anything to complain about.I'm glad that I got the Wi-Fi only version. I didn't have to pay for an expensive data plan, and I still have all the functionality.The GPS included works great, but the included app doesn't work offline--it requires the internet to access the maps, so you would have to choose your destination while connected to the internet if you're going to use it. Also, it doesn't know what to do if you go off its suggested course. This was a simple fix: I just downloaded a cheap ($4.99) GPS app which works great. The app is called CoPilot.The hardware is fairly rugged, but I would recommend getting some kind of case or cover. I got a generic \"sleeve\" for mine and it works great. I wouldn't recommend getting anything expensive. As for the size, it is just small enough to be portable, and perfectly large enough. I researched 10\" tablets, but decided that they would be too big for me. The only size problem I have is that it is a little too small to use for sheet music on a music stand.I didn't have any problems connecting to my home Wi-Fi or the networks at any other places (my grandparents' house, the beach house we went to, etc.). Connecting to wi-fi was easier on the tab than on my computer. It's also easy to turn the wi-fi, gps, etc. on and off and to adjust the brightness.I should share a few minor complaints that I do have:First, to charge the unit, you have to use the included charger. The charger is a small unit with a USB port on it. Then, to charge, you have to use the included cable (which is far too short). The fact that the two are separate implies that you can charge the unit from a PC or a generic USB charger, but this is not the case. The unit will not charge when connected to my computer or to my generic USB charger in my car. It will not even charge if I use a USB extension cable. This was a pain in my car because I was using it as a GPS on a long trip, and the battery almost ran out before I got there. I'm not sure if it would work if you bought a samsung adapter. That being said the battery lasts a really long time.Second, there are a few apps that come pre-loaded that can not be removed at all. Some apps are useful, but others are not. For example, there are Wall Street Journal and NY Times apps which can not be uninstalled, but are useless to me because I do not have a subscription to either of those papers.My final complaint is that the choice of mass-storage was micro-SD. It would have been much easier if it were just regular SD as the micro variety are more expensive and a little harder to come by.Overall, though, I would recommend this product to just about anyone.

I bought this item with great expectations, seeing as to how I fell in love with the Android platform after purchasing and rooting a Velocity Cruz Reader.  The specs posted should have made this a clear winner, and it was, until I started purchasing peripherals.  The first thing I bought was the composite video out cable because naturally, I wanted to watch some of my videos on the big screen.  Unfortunately, it didn't work with the first set of cables.  I contacted Samsung and they told me that they didn't know why it wasn't working, and that they'd email me back with a resolution once they researched it further.  In the mean time, I had Amazon replace the cables.  New cables arrived.  Same problem persisted.  Well, that was two sets of cables, so I thought perhaps the problem is with the unit I received. So I contacted Samsung again and was told that the cables should work with the WiFi only version, and they didn't know what the problem could be.  So I sent the unit back for replacement.A few days later I had a new Tab, new cables, and the same problems.  Decided to do a little research and found that the name \"Samsung Galaxy Tab (Wi-Fi) is a bit misleading, as it implies that the only thing different is that this version does not have mobile data capacity.  No, there's a slew of differences between this item and the original Samsung Galaxy Tab.  I'm not going to list the hardware differences as others have mentioned them already, but instead I'll tell you what you're missing because of the hardware differences.First, there's the ability to use peripherals such as the composite video out.  It works fine on the Verizon Galaxy Tab (which I purchased through Amazon Wireless) but it did not work with either Wi-Fi only versions.  In addition to that, I've noticed that my videos play better on the carrier version.  On the Wi-Fi version, some video would play back chopily, with random sound syncing problems and video that at times would stick and leave a ghost for a few seconds while the video played.

I am sure this is because there is too much background stuff going on. After I better understand the os I am sure I can get rid of most of this.Bottom line is this.

First, because they happen at all and second, because they are seamless and reliable. Android is buggy and needs fixing on this Samsung Tablet. Samsung's \"answer\" is to buy a new tablet.The device has two cameras and would be ideal for video chatting, but won't work with Skype. Apparently it needs the next version of Android.

But who knows if the next-up model will work either?These things all want to be Apple but simply fall short.One nice thing is that most Flash content is supported when web surfing.

First of all - the display is beautiful and adequately bright even at low settings.  It is very solidly built but isn't so heavy as to be uncomfortable to hold for long periods of time.  I have used it alot since I bought it and it's just under 50% battery so the battery life appears to be great.  Angry Birds Rio and several other games play just fine and appear to have minimal impact on the battery life.  And - it works great as a Kindle reader - in addition to the font size you can also set the background color which is handy.  Couple of reasons for the 4-star rating though:  First, and I did not know this before I bought it, at present it cannot be updated beyond Android 2.2.1.  Not a show-stopper but irritating anyway.  Secondly, and I didn't do my homework on this one either, I did not realize that Samsung cheapened/downgraded the processor and graphics on the Wi-Fi version.  It still runs pretty well, but I just tested a live wallpaper - and it brought the whole system to a crawl. The system was still responsive - but very slow.

After we gave away our portable car gps device (Motorola TN765), I was looking for a replacement when I got the idea to use a tablet instead. A tablet would also give me the flexibility to use it as a golf gps killing 2 birds with one stone. Looking at the various options available on the market at the time, I thought the 7 inch Samsung would be a good size to put in the car or hold in the hand while on the golf course.Overall I am very satisfied with this device. The following as the pros and cons with my rationalization for score.Pros:------ The screen is just the right size and is very bright with good colour accuracy. It is great in the car being able to see the street names clearly at a glance without being too big to block outward visibility.- Great gps locking. It is about as fast as the portable car gps units I've used in the past (Tom Tom and Motorola). It is much faster than the HTC Tilt/TyTn 2 and the Nokia N810 I've had and have tried to fulfil these functions.- It's made by a major electronics manufacturer and has been reasonably popular. This makes it easy to find an abundance of accesories and specific accessories like a good car dock.- Amazon free daily app. I don't know how long it will last, but having so many free full version apps to try satisfies the frugal in me.- I won't get into some of the other great features of the device like email and web browsing as I'm sure they have been covered countless times in other reviews.Cons:------ Application compatibility. For the most part, compatibity is good. There have been a few apps that refuse to run. I found a couple cases where I think the scaling is off and the pointer does not match your finger (Hex Defender and Golf Card GPS). Finally some apps don't scale at all and you're left with a black border around the app. I would like some kind of toggle to decide whether I want scale or not ala IPad. (-0.5 stars)- Not being able to charge in car when temperature is high. Living in Texas, the summer month temperatures get really hot. The Galaxy Tab refuses to charge when it detects that the temperature is too high. I know it is likely a safety feature, but as a car gps device, not being able to power the device while driving is a major limitation. I haven't taken any long road trips since getting this device, but I may be able angle some vents to move some cold air across it. (-0.5 stars)- It could be lighter. This is a bit of a preference thing. It feels heavier than it looks which makes it feel nice and solid. However, when holding it to browse the web or watch videos, it starts to feel like a brick. The weight also makes me worry when the car windshield mount loses suction. I don't think I can take any stars off for this, as this is a common problem for all tablets.Overall I would give this device 4/5 stars and generally exceeding my expectations in most respects. Using a multipurpose device for certain specific functions definitely present some compromises, but the Galaxy Tab really does work, and work well.", "Date": "July 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Samsung have ruined Android", "Author": "J.

I looked up the problem on the various forums and found a few people with the same problem and the only solution was a factory reset.  In addition to that aggravation, the device then began to freeze up. I called the Samsung support line and was to hold down the power button while simultaneously pressing the volume up button thus, you guessed it, initiating a factory reset.  The Samsung Website does not even contain any support info for this particular model and was of little to no use.  After spendingmany hours on the forums I finally learned about the Samsung Sync software for the device called Kies.  This has a terrible interface that is not intuitive at all.

I purchased a new Samsung Galaxy Tab  7 inch (Wi-Fi) from a wholeseller whose name most people would be quite familiar with.  I have an I Pod Touch, I Pod Nano, my husband has had an I-pad (first Gen), Kindle (which he loves)for several  years, my kids have I Pods etc., so I am quite familiar with the competition.I bought the Galaxy Tab 7 inch because I wanted something smaller but bigger than my I Pod touch to write / access a website where I send Prescriptions, I am a physician, so something bigger but not too big  that could fit in my white coat pocket but had easy to navigate graphics but nothing special was what I needed to carry from one exam room to another was what I needed.  I thought the I-Pad was too large for ease of use.  I also needed easy , larger visibility,to enter new patient data, not just access to existing data was important.  Frankly, I also did not want to spend $700+ dollars so the price was attractive to me  as the Galaxy was under $400 dollars.  For about a week it seemed to do the job, but was a little slower than what I was used to in moving from one place to another in comparison to my desk top computer.  The color, graphics etc were great.  However, over the next 10 days after a full charge each day I noted that it seemed to hold less and less time to use.  Again, I used it for about 6 hours non-stop each day and charged at the end of my session, no movies, no fancy games, just to one website.Finally, on day 12, after a full charge it would not turn on at first, maybe I just didn't push the side button correctly??, then it turned on, I went to my website ( the same one I had used many times), and IT JUST Froze!, I couldn't go anywhere, I could not even turn it off!!!.  I called Samsung Support and they told me I could return it to the seller (full refund if within 14 days), or send it to them for a repair, something about the battery or software they said.  Well, I took it back the next day to the Wholesale Club for a full Cash refund because frankly , I just didn't trust the device after I saw this happen and I did not need the aggrivation of something that might work fine one day and crash the next.  Got my money back in full , was offered a replacement, but I said no thanks.  Not sure what would my experience would have been after 14 days since the wholeseller told me I would have had to deal with Samsung and not them. I think other reviewers may have mentioned a similar type of experience so be ware.  I never even watched a movie or  bought any apps.  Regarding Apps Samsung has their own App Store/Droid, and frankly, there app store is nothing compared to the variety on Apple, but again I did not purchase this device to download Apps but was surprised to see how limited the Apps were.  I had no trouble setting up my e-mail account and other than the \"crash\", the apps it came loaded with were fine for me.  Nevertheless, for over $400 + dollars I expected better.

Crisp, clear screen.4. excellent speakers (12/11/11 at least a couple of notches louder than Kindle's)--------------------------December 11th, 2011 - Comparing to KINDLEI just purchased a Kindle for a teenager as an early Christmas gift, and a late birthday present (birthday was in summer), for $200 at Wal-Mart (easier to return if something is wrong).  Also purchased warranty for another year for $17.- Kindle is slightly heavier- Kindle only gets Kindle books.  My Samsung Tab 7 (wifi only) gets Nook & Kindle.  (2012Jan19 - I thought I'd read a lot of books but ended up reading a lot more websites.  If I read, it's just Kindle since I have an account there.)IMPORTANT: I read another review that mentioned CREDIT CARD, in another an Amz acct, is needed to download Kindle books.  I didn't think it was correct. Well, it is.  You can only download apps and Kindle books, even free ones, into Kindle through an AMZ/Kindle account.  When you go the website, you'd get redirected to the Market apps app.  Well, the good thing is I can now keep track of what apps and/or books are being downloaded into the Kindle by the teenager.  :-) )- Kindle can open twice more than # of browser windows than the Tab which can open only 6..but I think that's plenty.- Kindle has Hulu+ & Netflix.  Maybe my Tab has to be rooted? (2012jan19...Still no Hulu..Netflix app works.)- Kindle has 8G internal, but only 6G are available to user. Tab has 16G with 32G expandable.  I'm not sold on Kindle's cloud as I've always email the docs/files to myself.  I have a $20/year with Yahoo Mail and after 11 years, nothing got deleted yet.I bought the Kindle for a teenager who never had a touch-pad before so nothing fancy is needed.  He can check email, FB, watch YouTube/Wimp.com, log on to college website to see assignments, type up notes with Notepad (he downloaded the app), play games (Angry Birds, of course!), do browse the web for class work or just to goof off.2012Jan19  -  One of the worst customer service  experiences.The Home key stopped working.  But that's not the worst of it.The worst is when I called Samsung 800 #, and I got transferred too many times; I lost count after 7.The plus, I can understand them.  The minus, they all, except for the last guy, said about the same thing, like they were reading from the script, and their job description includes \"send the callers around to different made-up departments until they got so frustrated and pissed off that they'd hang up.\"Script (I remember because after the 3rd time, who wouldn't?)\"May I have your name?\"  \"Would you please give me the so-so # on the back of the tablet?\" The only # I can see is the serial #.  \"Go to Settings-About Device\" No, the # you're looking for is not there.  \"Ok. I'll try the serial # then.\"  How about model #?  \"Ok\"  \"Tell me what's the problem is.\" Home key stopped working.  It vibrates but nothing happens.  \"Is it the button or touchscreen button?\" (I think Samsung should program their computer the picture of the tablet so when rep enters in the model/serial #, the picture would come up and at least he/she would have a general idea what I'm looking at.)  No, it's not a phone.  No, I'm not calling from it. (The US version can't be used as a phone.)-\"I'll transfer you to the appropriate department.\"-Which department?  \"Electronics\"  \"You just need to choose the option for electronics when I transfer you.\"-What is the # of the department that you're transferring me to? \"800-726-7864\"-That's 800-SAMSUNG.  That's the # I called.  \"You just need to press option # (I can't remember which)\"Guess what?  That option is not available so I had to stay on the Samsung Customer Service's merry-go-round half way through my lunch break before I got a live person who sounded totally annoyed.Guess what I have to do?  RESET.  I lost all apps that I installed but NOT the ones that Samsung placed there (those good-for-nothing, memory-hog, must-force-stop-but-restart- itself-anyway apps that cannot be installed unless you root your device which means warranty voided) ...thank goodness, I found out later not the photos or music I transferred on the tablet from my PC, but my Rhapsody app was removed so I had to downloaded my music and playlists again.BATTERY:  29% @ plugged in @ around 8:20 A.M.

Despite repeated calls to my IT department, Samsung, and visiting numerous support sites, it simply could not connect and download my email, contacts, etc. Even the workaround that most suggested (using a 3rd party app called \"Touchdown\") was not feasible, as that app could not be downloaded to the Tab.So, despite my attraction to the device, back to Amazon it went.

From the beginning, we were promised an upgrade to a faster, smoother Android operating system, Honeycomb, but we never got it. Apparently Samsung splotched up this product as a competitor to Apple, reduced the amount of RAM for the equivalent 3G models, and just gave up on this model when newer models came out, forgetting about the hundreds of thousands of people who forked over the 350 to buy what they thought would be a good product.I initially bought this product because I hate the whole idea that Apple has cornered the industry on Tablets, and I wanted to just use a decent device to read ebooks, surf the web, play games, and send emails. I initially liked the easy drag-and-drop quality to this device, and the kindle app worked fine (which is what I use this device for 70% of the time) but the iPad has that too.After using it for a week, I realized I didn't get what I paid for. The operating system was slow. If more than two programs were run, the device slows down. It crashed on me a fair few times, at least a few times a week, and I used it for about 10-15 hours/week. Multitasking is a joke, almost as much as the operating system. I thought initially that the poor operating system for this device was to blame, but almost all android devices have the same problem. When I played around on an iPad 2, I noticed a difference of light years. First, you can run multiple programs (scores of them) and the multitask function on the iPad doesn't slow your OS down. More RAM. Better functionality. No hangups or freezes. And more apps.So for those who hated Apple as much as me, put aside your hatred for just a few minutes and play around with an iPad. Then, save up about $186 (currently this is listed on sale as $314), and get the iPad 2.

This is an ok entry level tablet.  The product works and is better than the cheap tablets (at least that I tried), but definitely is not a direct Ipad competitor.  I bought the Wifi as I did not need or want 3g. The performance and screen are a little better than a Nook Color and it feels a little better balanced in your hands (IMO).  The Galaxy 7 tab also does not allow all apps to run off the Market Place, ie facebook currently, I also purchased a mortgage calculator program that does not insert dates correctly for some reason.  So there are a few quirks across the various android devices at this time.What is most dissappointing is samsungs lack of support for the Wifi only version.  Not only do they not inform you that some adapters do not work on the wifi version that will work on other 3g versions, they also do not allow updates to this version.Also getting playlists for music to sync correctly can be challenging (in general with android as I have an Archos 43 with same issues).  The Kies synching program that samsung uses doesn't work great for playlists either, it will load the Playlists onto the Tablets, but if you decide you no longer want them on the tablet is does not remove them all off the tablet.  An update may take care of this.  I now use Double twist on my PC, but DBLT on the Tablet still does not always show playlists correctly.  I have found that using Double TWist on the PC and Winamp on the Tablet works pretty well (usually), other than you may get duplicate playlists on the Tablet in Winamp you simply need to delete. Again, updates will likely take care of this.  If playlists are not your thing, no big deal, if they are you may want to stick to Apple for now.I would not recommend this product for $300+. I obtained it for $270 @ BB and still feel that was a little too much without firmware updates and a few adapters (HDMI video out).  Essententially if you are considering a Nook color or Amazon Fire or something for the kids and can get this tablet for a similar price then I would consider it in your list.  I am also concerned about future SAmsung tablet products any more with the lack of update support and what I feel is misleading sales information, or at least inadequate information regarding the Wifi vs 3g version.  There is no reason a Wifi version should not run and update to exactly what the 3G versions do.  If there is this significant of a difference it should be very clearly labeled instead of needing to read reviews from other users, dissappointed from that perspective.", "Date": "October 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Superb Tablet!", "Author": "The 007 bandit", "ReviewID": "R1U3AT8FXKKOM3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an amazing product.

I first purchased a KOBY 7022 because of the perfect size. I returned it because it was not worth the money in terms of functionality. I decided to do a little research and came up with raving reviews of the Galaxy tab 7.0. I ordered one which came in a flash. I have not been disappointed since it arrived about a month ago. It does all I want it to do and I can just drop it into my bag when it is in a case or in my jacket pocket when it is not in a case-perfect for my needs. I will recommend it for anyone. The few issues I have with it are the following: (1) It has no reset button so if it freezes and the power up/down do not work, like any computer sometimes does, you have no way of shutting it down. I had to go online to read about how to deal with the problem-I got my answer from fellow users and it worked. (2) It is a shame that no other wall/car charger will work with the Samsung tablet unless the ones dedicated to it. If you buy the USB cable, it will not work with any pluggable detachable wall or car charger. You must buy a compatible one from Samsung. Other devices merely require the right USB cable and you can use it on a computer to charge or on any detachable plug-in charger-not the Samsung. (3) As mentioned above, it cannot be charged on a computer unlike other devices out there (4) it's a little bulky- I guess its smallness makes it imperative for bulkiness since a thinner galaxy would not have the required space for all it holds. For example, the I-pad could be made very thin because it is longer and wider so it has room for all the \"guts\". All in all, my Samsung Galaxy 7.0 Tablet 16GN WI-FI can hold its own against others out there and some more. I love what it does and I love its size. The product itself is a 5 star.

A few months later, I bought myself the iPad 2, and found significant differences in responsiveness and wifi connectivity. The tab web browsing offers slow clunky scrolling and the screen, I later felt, was too small. With wifi, once in a while the tab disconnects and forgets my home network, prompting me to again enter my very very long annoying password a couple of times until the device connects. The iPad has no problems like this.  And just so people are aware, this is an android device, meaning you will be connected with the android market and no other. This isn't the fault of the tab, but if one wants a larger app market don't go to android devices. You'll be disappointed in how limited it really is compared to the apple market. Let me state again, IT IS IN NO WAY THE FAULT OF THE GALAXY TAB THAT THE MARKET IS SMALL, but until more people decide to release apps on the android market, I'll be with the apple products.
