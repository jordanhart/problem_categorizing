GetJar has never worked, but if you download 1Mobile Market and Amazon Apps, it's like having Google Play!  Got Netfilx and Adobe Flash Player working with a bit of work. Kings Office makes my table very practical for school. Everything was fine in terms of WiFi, whether I went to school or a cafe w/ internet or a coffee shop, even Burger King and Target.  The problem came when I took it to work and tried to log onto the network.  The tablet was able to recognize the network and ask me for my creditals, but when I entered my information, it just said \"saved\" and would not connect.  I purchased this unit September 24th of this year brand new, so I called customer service and asked them what I can do.  Their only answer is to send it back and get another one if it's broken.  It couldn't get onto on server, so at the time I didn't think it was worth the effort.  As I found out 10 weeks later, my tablet had an older Android Ice Cream Sandwich preloaded, 4.0.3, which was reporting problems with connecting to 802.1XX EAP secured servers.  I contacted customer service again and asked them how can I correct the operating system.  They told me that I have to send it in for a replacement and it would take 4-6 weeks, which is ridiculous since they are not updating my unit, but pulling another one off the shelf to send to me.  Then I asked why did my tablet have an older version of the OS on it in the first place, being that Android OS Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0.4, 4.0.5 and Jellybean 4.1 was already out prior to my purchase. They said that's the way it is and the only option I have to is to send my current tablet in and wait 4-6 weeks. So the bottom line is this:  I really like the tablet for the money, I can hook up Netflix to my HDTV, get online everywhere (but work), listen to music, watch videos, all of the advertise points and then some.  However, customer service is completely lacking and even ignorant of their own product (they could not tell me how to get Netflix).  They make the tablet so you cannot update the OS, even when they send you an installed version that is outdated and riddled with bugs, so if you order this tablet (I would recommend it), then make sure that you have the most up-to-date Ice Cream Sandwich OS on it before doing anything with it.UPDATE 1-11-2013SOOO.....my screen died and I have to send it back and get a new unit.  They said it will take 3-4 weeks.  Don't get why it takes that long to replace an item when they are not reparing my unit.  As I stated earlier, the customer service is not good at all.", "Date": "December 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "good cheap tablet, cant access google play (android market)", "Author": "Ethermadness", "ReviewID": "R2PRHBDVRTIJXJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "this was a great tablet, the touch screen is very responsive with your finger or a stylus. it has basic apps for web browsing, email, youtube, but there is no support for flash player and you cannot acces the google play store. if you have an android phone you can download the astro backup packager app and back up apps on your phone and connect your phone or micro sd to the tablet and install your phone apps on this tablet like I did.i had this tablet for 3.5 weeks, I had it charging on a flat wooden table and I woke up the next morning and the screen was pixelated and the bottom half didn't show any picture. so I returned it to amazon and they refunded me my money as soon as I dropped the return package off at ups", "Date": "December 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Product", "Author": "ANTS_DWILL", "ReviewID": "R2NST97W2LPVGZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was a bit disappointed that it didn't include Google play, but it has been a good investment so far.", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "Doris Pryor", "ReviewID": "R3A5QJA8EV5KC7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased them for my grand kids and i will be purchasing another one this week for my son.  to uses to read books on.", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Happy!!", "Author": "Joseph Nowell", "ReviewID": "R3QUYRLUIO6Z0J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this for my 2.5 year old for games.

Well they got this 8-inch right. I like everything about it, especially the 4:3 screen ratio, as I'm not a huge fan of wide screen displays on small tablets.  First, the styling is nice, not plasticky at all.  It feels good in the hands, nice balance.  Glass is nice.  Display is very good.  The response was a pleasant surprise.  I'm getting 100% strength on my wireless, and it hasn't dropped the connection once.  I downloaded the Amazon AppStore and installed it with no problem.  (I don't like GetJar).  The only thing it won't do is run Netflix, but that's not a showstopper for me, as I have another device for that.  I'm really enjoying this tablet, will be using it every day.

A physical notebook with pages of lyrics just took up too much space and was a hassle during outdoor performances when the wind was blowing.It turns out that the MID8042-2 has worked out great for that purpose, with the addition of Adobe Reader for Android, and the size is just right. It also does many other things well, although I found the default browser to be rough around the edges, so now I'm using Opera.
