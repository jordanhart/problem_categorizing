{"Reviews": [{"Title": "It really shines in battery life, WIFI reception and plays Netflix streaming video movies without stuttering !!", "Author": "Aaron M.

Surprise surprise it has descent battery life, WIFI reception is great, and Netflix video streaming is smooth. I have a much more expensive tablet PC that does not play Netflix smoothly at all so price is not always best performance. Touch screen is responsive but not the best that I have played with. The screen is washed out colors unless you turn up the brightness all the way up. Screen is pretty bright but viewing angles are very limited with this 10.1 LCD. The Black case is shiny and very well made, but do not try to twist the case at all or drop it, for the LCD may break. You can see movement on the LCD screen when handling and putting pressure on the case. Has all the exterior connectors you need and labeled decently, volume controls and buttons are in good places and feel positive when pushed. I would say this tablet is not bad for a lower price than what is listed here, battery life shocks me how good and long it runs even with screen at full brightness. I would say a run time of at least 6 hours. Android games play smoothly for a dual core, a little slow at times and lagging on some web pages but over all this tablet operates pretty smooth on scrolling and expanding web pages. It does allot for the money if you can get it for $109 ?", "Date": "June 4, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00DSU1RDS"}}
