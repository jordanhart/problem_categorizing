I was looking for a ten inch tab, but didn't have a lot of cash.  I already have the Acer Iconia A-100, which is a great tablet. But i wanted a 10 incher.  When i first got it, it ran fine but there was no Google App Store, bummer, So I got the Amazon App Store.  everything was working fine but when I loaded Netflix it didn't work, the app loaded fine but the screen would just go blank.  I called Coby Customer Service and they said it was a problems with Adobe flash not running right?  Anyways, with Coby you actually get a live person however, you may not get one that knows anything.  So i looked around on the internet and found that this is a problem with the tablet.  I also found a solution. A tech advised to reboot the system and erase factory files. Here is the message ---- \"Power the unit off (holding power buttom) and selecting Power off, then hold simultaneusly back button and on buttom 8 seconds,when the android icon appears press the back button, in the menu select wipe data/factory reset pressing home buttom and then press back buttom, in the next screen select \"yes delete all user data\" pressing back buttom, and in the next screen select \"reboot system now\" with the back buttom and wait. IT WORK FOR MY TABLET.\" ------After doing this download the Good e-Reader app store through Getjar. The Good e-Read app store has everything. Netflix now works great on my tablet. I was also able to down load pretty much every app the Google Play Store has. They even have the Google Play Store app.  Anyways, after doing this my tablet runs smoother, seems to be faster and everything works. Took this tablet from a 3 to a 5 star. I now love this tablet.  Oh, when doing this it will erase things (music, pics, videos) on the tablet but not on the SD Card.", "Date": "October 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "great for certain things", "Author": "Darrell Meece", "ReviewID": "RYDML0WV7D5LQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is for the 10\" coby. I got it to replace the functions of an e-ink kindle. I wanted to be able to read books, surf some simple web pages, maybe check my e-mail and calendar, play some simple games. I liked the idea of a bigger screen that I could see page-size pdf (and maybe a comic book) on. It turns out that this tablet is fine for those needs.It actually seems made pretty well. The touch screen seems to work well - by way of comparison, I've had a couple of older tablet pc's, and older windows ce pda's, my wife has an older resistive touch 7\" android, I have an android phone. So on the one hand I've used a lot of touch screens, on the other, I can remember when you had to have a proprietary batter-powered stylus to use one. So to me, the touch screen seems pretty good, but I don't know how that will translate to others. It is a finger print magnet and picks up smudges like mad. It is perfectly adequate for e-book reading and playing simple android games.I am an average sized male and the size is fine for me for a big book reader. The trade off of the bigger screen is that you have a bigger device to hold. I can just \"palm\" it with one hand - it is 16 X 9 so it seems longer than it does wide. I don't think it is too large to be a comfortable reader.The wi-fi connected in a snap, couldn't be easier. One thing that is sort of annoying is that everytime I resume from a suspend I have to disconnect and reconnect the wi-fi for it to connect. I haven't figured a way around that yet, but I think it may be an ice cream sandwich \"feature.\" It connects easily to our linux computers with the cable.I found that I was more bugged by the lack of google play marketplace than I thought I'd be. As best I can tell, everyone who has tried rooting the 10\" has bricked it. So I didn't root it. You can get the apk for google play easy enough and side load it, but the device isn't on google's list of approved devices so the apk won't run and connect to the market. Because you can't root it, you can't edit the boot file to spoof it as a device on google's list. So unless you root it or google adds it you won't be connecting to google play.Which isn't really that big of a deal. It has a get jar market on it, but I had already put on amazon market before I bothered looking at it, and there's really not much use in it. The amazon market is easy enough for anyone to add - just point the web browser to amazon and follow the directions. Of all things, the only thing I wanted to put on it so far but wasn't able to yet is tux math for the kids - it is on google play but not amazon market and I can't find the apk on the web. It was easy enough to side load other apks. It runs the angry birds apps fine, and the cut the ropes, fruit ninjas, temple runs. I had a devil of a time getting where's my water/Perry to install. It just wouldn't install. I tried different versions and nothing, then one time I tried it for a lark and both just installed and now they play fine. I must have installed something with a needed library or something along the way. Who knows. I downloaded free solitaire and freecell from amazon and they work fine. That's enough games for me, so I haven't bothered putting any emulators on it, without hardware buttons I don't care to.It has both a regular size usb and a micro usb, which is nice because you can use something like a usb key board. The power plug is an additional little port. The batteries last longer than I thought they would - good enough for me to read and play some games. I put some videos on there just to see them and they worked fine. The kids watched some youtube on it and that was fine. I couldn't get netflix to install on it though.It has an micro sd card slot, that is important to me. The file structure is a little wonkey, but you'll find the sd card if you look around. After the first time it didn't really matter to me because it remembered the location in the history and I can just click the short cut there.It comes with a book reader built in. I side loaded an epub file and it seemed to present it just fine. I went ahead and put the cool reader app on it because I like the flexibility of that app. I used it to read A Dance with Dragons an it was a good book reading experience - I turned off the background and just use white text on black or yellow on blue. Honestly I didn't miss e-ink and I was a fan of it.It isn't an ipad and it isn't a tegra 3. It is $150 bucks. So if you want the ipad or a tegra 3 don't get this. If you have some basic android experience then this will seem familiar and easy, and if you want a basic tablet then this is a fine one. I got lucky here, it fits my needs very well - so if you are looking for something like that, book reader, web, simple games, with a bigger screen I'd recommend this to you.", "Date": "September 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "A couple of Aha Moments . . .", "Author": "nizzly", "ReviewID": "RG1ACDALT2AOV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Arrived quickly, and I was very happy with how it looked!Things to note:- This takes a very small, 5V DC power supply, which is unusual to me.- It is an unsupported Google device = no Play app store, and still can't figure out how to get HBO GO to work on it, and can't get Facebook created app (unless someone tells me where else you can download it from!)- Has a very sensitive power button - last 3 times I've put it in my backpack for use at work, the power button has been hit in transit and I arrive with it drained and unusable.  Could probably be remedied by buying a better case than by using the slipcover it comes with.- Back button often exits you out of something, rather than taking you to your last page/position.- Browser, while effective, does not have near the same functionality as the browser on my PC.- Browser feels slow to me, and it's annoying.Other things to note:- Sound quality was surprisingly good for what it is.- Keyboard is awesome and works really well, which surprised me.- Absolutely zero lag in streaming of either music or video - win!!!- You can still do lots of great stuff, like use other social media apps that allow you to view Facebook, or use the browser for it (can't get browser version of HBO GO however, *sad clown face*).- Use Amazon app store for lots of good stuff even if you can't use Google Play app store - the Get Jar app store was surprisingly limited.  Might just be the brand new O/S.- Picks up home wi-fi & mobile hotspot (wi-fi from my phone) just great, never had a problem with that!- Renders books really well and is fun to use for reading.Overall, because it is less than half price of any other 10\" tablet out there, I will give it a \"like\" rating and deal with what it doesn't do.  But the HBO GO thing was a major blow and the big reason behind losing a whole star.  I've heard that they are supposed to be coming out with a new version of the app that I can get to and will work on this O/S, but my fingers are still crossed on that . . .Also, in case anyone from Google is reading this - you majorly effed up by allowing others to license your O/S by NOT also allowing anyone with said O/S's devices to be able to access YOUR CONTENT.

I mainly wanted a better experience playing games, viewing apps like Google Earth and streaming Collage Football games via the Watchespn app. As good as the i-pod is, it was just too small for some situations. I wanted to upgrade to an I-pad, but theI-Pad was just out of my price range.So after much research, I decided on the 10\" Coby despite the fact there was no access to the Google Play Store. I verified that I could download Google Earth and Watchespn from The Amazon App store so that wasn't an issue. I ordered my Tablet with the keyboard/case and the 16GB micro memory card. Both I would highly recommended getting. All 3 came in a very timely manner.This is my first Android device but I quickly found my way around and downloaded a few apps from Getjar. The best advice for apps is going to Getjar and download the \"Good E reader Android App Store\" they have a better choice of apps and from there you can also download other Appstores such as Amazon,1 Mobile and Appbrain.Pros:Great price. At present time $149.00Great picture quality for both photos and videos.Lots of storage available for apps (8GB internal)+ up to 32GB on a Micro memory card.HDMI inputStreams and plays UTube videos wellGood choice of accessories available from Amazon.com such as  cases,keyboards,screen protectors, Mini HDMI to HDMI cords and mini sd cards. All reasonably priced and wont break the bank.Good battery life. Lasts about 6 hours.No problems with the WiFi.Good for gameplayIdeal for E-BooksTouchscreen has good response.Cons:Poor camera quality. UselessPreloaded Browser crashes constantly. I use Google Chrome, it works much better.The 1042 Wont win any races while surfing the net.A bit slow loading pages. Some patience required!!No Google Play.Its a deal breaker for some but it shouldn't be.Speaker sound is fair at best. You can use headphones or amplified speakers to improve sound.I am very happy with my purchase so far. I think people who gave this Coby Tablet a bad review just didn't give it a fair chance. Granted you get what you pay for and this Tablet can't compete with the high end Tablets for performance but for the price it holds its own.

At first it would just randomly disconnect, which was annoying, but I just reconnected and moved on. By the next day, however, it wouldn't connect at all. It kept telling me the wi-fi was out of range, even when I was sitting right next to it. I took it to a few other places - on the off-chance it was my wi-fi - still didn't work.Bum deal. But that's what warranties are for, right? Aside from the wi-fi issue, it's still a nice little tablet.EXCEPT...I called Coby and after being on hold forever and bounced between 3 different reps, the not-so-nice lady told me I had to pay to send the tablet to them (insured) AND pay a $15 processing fee AND wait 6-8 weeks for them to fix it or send me a REFURBISHED tablet.Seriously? I get to pay an extra $30ish dollars for a REFURBISHED tablet?I will never again buy a product from Coby.

I bought a new one - not a used one ...I read the reviews before my purchase and now I'm mad at the lower ratings that mislead buyers into thinking they would NOT be able to log in to Facebook or YouTube. You have full access to the internet; Anything you can log in to on a PC you can log in to with this tablet.As a matter of fact the only thing the poorer ratings said that was true was you can not get Google Apps ... but who cares ... You can get all the popular applications for free using their GetJar ... Push one button and it takes you to Angry Birds, Star Wars Angry Birds, hundreds of games, the free Avast Anti-Virus, Video Phone, Personalization ... I could go on forever.This tablet is great. The only critique I have would be the battery life. The battery displays a standard 3 hours lifespan. I can get 4 to 5 hours depending on whether or not I'm watching a movie, videos, or playing games.  It uses none of the battery while it's off.The number of hours you spend on the tablet will account for the number of hours you'll need to recharge. I don't like that.I would like to just plug it in to an outlet and continue using it beyond the battery life, but the User Guide warns you not to do that. As long as the tablet is plugged in - it is recharging - and it could overheat or even catch fire. It's a warning that comes with any portable PC I know ... I just find it unacceptable. Can't they just set it so you can run AC power without using the recharge?I would recommend this tablet for anyone that doesn't care about name brands or wants a tablet for less the price.  I would recommend this tablet to anyone that doesn't care whether or not they that can download user made applications from Google. I would recommend this tablet to anyone that isn't an Apple Cultist.

I bought it largely to stream movies with Netflix (subscription required). Thanks to this tablet, I've also discovered free ebooks and magazines from my local library. I love reading my local newspaper in the free Overdrive app (newspaper subscription required). Checking email, weather reports, and my Hotmail calendar is quick and easy. I'm glad I got a 10\" tablet because magazines, movies, and games can really take advantage of the extra large screen.Over all, I think this tablet is a great value. I would buy it again, and I highly recommend it. Keep in mind that installing a bunch of apps and customizing the tablet may require some extra know-how plus hours (and hours) of your time. I also recommend that you purchase an inexpensive tablet stand (there are several types available on Amazon).I'm probably going to also buy a Kindle e-reader. The e-ink screens are easier on the eyes; and dedicated e-readers are much easier to hold when you're reading a book for several hours.What I like:> Large, beautiful screen> Excellent touch response> Easy to use settings> Convenient buttons for power, volume, and \"back\"> Expandable storage via MicroSD slot> USB connection> Wifi was easy to set up and connect to my home network> Great built-in email client> Great battery life with most apps (several hours)What I dislike:> Cannot access Google Play (a.k.a. Android app store)> Front-facing camera is almost worthless. No flash, can't easily scan QR codes, doesn't work well with Skype app> Built-in speakers are not very loud. You may need to use headphones or an external speaker> Heavy and difficult to hold for long periods of time (like reading a book)> Web pages take a while to load. It's often faster to just turn on my laptop when looking something up> Cannot mount a network drive (or at least I can't figure out how to), although you CAN browse network drives using the included ES File Explorer app> Battery life is too short for reading lots of books (typical problem with color LCD tablets)> No back-facing camera> It takes a while to charge (I feel like it takes several hours, but I haven't timed it)What I use it for:*Note: Some of these apps were hard to find and/or install because this tablet cannot access the Google Play app store.> Watch movies with Netflix app - Netflix subscription required> Listen to music with Pandora app> Read local newspaper with PressReader app - newspaper subscription required> Read ebooks and magazines - borrowed from local library via website (free) - using Overdrive app and Kindle app for ebooks - Zinio app for magazines> Check my Hotmail calendar> Check the weather with Weather.com app (free)> Check email> Check my budget with YNAB app (requires YNAB desktop software)> Surf the web with Firefox app (free)Where I get my apps:> Amazon app store (lots of great free and paid apps)> Aptoide app store (some apps, hit or miss)> papktop.com (some apps, hit or miss)> Getjar (a few apps)> Bing search for the app's \"apk\" file, then transfer the apk file to tablet and install it> Other random app websites (often difficult to use, some may not be entirely legal)Update: I have been using this tablet for a few months. My rating has dropped to a \"3\". Netflix works alright, and so do email apps, magazine apps, weather app, Pandora, etc. Skype doesn't work at all. Web browsing is PAINFULLY slow, and pretty much pointless. Apps freeze all the time. The tablet can't even run the keyboard app smoothly. But the worst part is WiFi. It often loses the wireless connection when I take it more than 40 feet from my router. That is unacceptable. I'm going to sell it and buy a better tablet.

The 7 and 9 inch screen Kyros are easily rooted by now, and I'm sure the 10.1 inch version will eventually be rooted, but even without rooting the little device is FANTASTIC.Don't get me wrong, the tablet has flaws and if I cared about using the internet browser, I'd most likely not be as satisfied as I am.I knew what I wanted when I bought the tablet. I wasn't 100% sure that the Kyros would accomplish everything I wanted, but I took a gamble and came out very satisfied.The first thing you're going to want to do if you're not rooting the tablet is get Amazon Market app from amazon.com on the device's browser. After that...1. I wanted something to read comics while at work without bringing my physical copies with me.  I downloaded ComicCat from the Amazon Market app. The app let me import and read every CBR file I'd all ready had in my PC's library. It works great on this device.2. I wanted to be able to draw and sketch with the tablet. Once again, I hit up the Amazon Market app and downloaded SketchBook Pro. The app works great, with only a very small delay between my strokes on the screen and the brush's stroke through the app. If you want to use SketchBook, you'll definitely want to get a stylus for your device. Works great though.3.I wanted to read Ebooks, and the Kindle for Android app works great on this as well.4.I wanted to play some simple games. The Kyros has handled everything I've downloaded for it.The SD card expansion is great. You can even use an external USB HDD for removable storage but it's not as convenient as the SD Card. If you're wanting to watch videos you could buy multiple cards and fill them with video and just pop them in and out of the device for unlimited storage.So the stuff that would have disappointed me if I'd been into other activities.The screen position sensor is a little wonky and sluggish at the same time. If you want to turn the tablet and change the view mode from portrait to landscape, the device will take a little over a second to make the transition... but on occasion the sensor will tell it that the little wiggles and body shifts natural to holding the device without resting against a desk or something means that you want to shift it to another view mode. This means you have to wait for it to shift, then wait for it to shift back. In apps where this becomes annoying, I just turn off the app's use of that function.The keyboard is sluggish at times. If you're wanting to write a book or something, I'd definitely recommend getting something else.You'll want to periodically fully power down the device and make sure that you aren't running extraneous apps in the background to prevent over taxing the processor. As long as you're somewhat attentive and patient, the tablet is fantastic. If you can't take a few seconds to set up your apps to counteract the tablet's flaws... then maybe you'd be better served spending several extra hundred dollars on a Xoom, Touchpad, or Ipad.", "Date": "September 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Coby mid1042 10.1 Inch Tablet", "Author": "Ollie", "ReviewID": "R2K57VB0QPEV85", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I must say this is my first Tablet.

However, I wasn't able to check my email through the 'email app' (included when getting the tablet), so I had to go through the proper channels (ie; getting to yahoo, signing in, etc).  This just wasted more time! Of course, the \"typing lapse\" continued.

The Android Ice Cream platform will not allow you to access Google apps play store and does not recognize the device. It's almost deceiving that it's [resented as Android when you can't run Android apps because of the different platform. It's not an isolated case as I also purchased the 7\" version and I can not download the face book apps that run through google play store which are touted as Android Apps. As far as speed and surfing, it's efficient however again, since the tablet platform is unrecognized you will be limited on what mobile apps you can download for instance Iheart radio app, Zynga etc., even websites that stream audio. I accessed a local radio station that broadcasts live. It didn't work with these tablets and pops up as device not recognized or supported.If you want a basic surfing and email device with games that will function on this platform buy it. If you want more choices in apps through Google Playstore don't but you'll spend a little bit more more the convenience. As far as features, the camera is limiting as you cant see what you are shooting as it it faces towards the user and there is no viewer. I use the gallery photos for virtual tours of properties and it is grainy. A better camera that was designed for pictures would be advisable otherwise it's a Skye type camera. The Getjar app does have a nice selection of apps however Skype on both tablets is not very good and sends a signal processed to the receiving user as pink and not clear. The person sending Skype was clear as a bell so I would assume it's the Kyros that is sending a bad picture due to the platform or the processor.It was disappointing.", "Date": "September 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Coby Kyros MID 1042 Tablet", "Author": "Ginamarie Martino", "ReviewID": "R1LPWHEK1SBAUF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ordered the Coby MID1042 Tablet from Amazon w/ free shipping.

Plugged it in, charged it and it was ready to go.I was able to get ALL the apps I wanted onto this tablet.  Not all from the same sight though.  Getjar is ok and has plenty of free apps. Not the ones I needed tho.  But if you log onto the browser you can bookmark your favorite pages right on your home screen.  Amazon, Netflix, Yahoo mail, Pinterest, facebook booked marked really easy and open up to the last page you had.  Again these are right on your main home screen.Then I downloaded an app from Getjar called \"Good E-reader android app store\".  this app is actually a store, so I was able to download a few apps off of this app for free.  This also had Netflix Aodbe and lots of popular games.Then my struggle was trying to kindle onto my tablet.  It took me a while and a lot of research but I was able to download the \"Amazon AppStore\". right from amazon.com  Not easy, not hard.Here were the steps I had to follow.On my tablet I went to settings - then to applications - make sure the \"unknrown sources\" is checked.Then I went to Amazon Appstore and in the upper right corner it asks for you email.Then it sends you a email with a link to download.Once its downloaded, you can see on the home page the downloaded icon, the one with the down arrow.I clicked on that and it installed the app.  Pretty easy actually.After that I was able to download Kindle and Audible.I am very happy with this tablet, yes it did take me hours to figure out how to get some of the apps but I didnt have to download anything to my computer or put anything on an SD card.The screen doen not act like an Ipad.  It is not a tap screen, but more of a touch and hold for 1 second screen.  One you realize this it just becomes natural to hold the icon. Not bad, just different.I would recommend this to my family and friends.  All I can say is be patient when trying to set up your favorite apps.

It is faster and more responsive than my phone (an lg optimus elite, and the only android device I have to compare to) The touch screen works well and quickly. The text is clear (I've read about 40 different comics so far and only had to zoom in on text once)I suppose anyone else who has read e-comics on a smaller device hates double page spreads as much as I do, but no more! Loading and scrolling around them is super fast and easy. On the downside, there's no market. I haven't found that terribly inconvenient, aside from having some trouble finding a way to put comicrack on it. I also only see 4 GB, not 8, of storage but I didn't look that hard. Not a real big deal, just order a memory card to go with it.

The tablet itself is not heavy, responds to touch well, and has a great screen.  I would google rooting your Android device before purchasing this table to get full functionality.

The Coby Kryos MID7048-4 did however meet all my expectations.  My main reason for purchasing this tablet was in order to read E-Books.  I installed Kindle for Android and all works great.  I wasn\u2019t sure that I would like reading on a tablet but soon found that I actually prefer it to paper books, not to mention the convenience of not having books stacked all over the place.  Amazon has tons of books available and if you have an Amazon Prime account many are free and many more are very inexpensive.  Browsing the net is expectedly not as convenient as on a full sized computer, but it is certainly a reasonable option when needed.  The screen resolution is quite good though I know more expensive tablets have higher resolutions.  There are tons of applications available from Amazon and the many other Android App. Stores. I have a 32gb Micro SD card installed which works great.  I also purchased a OTG (On The Go - Male Micro USB to Female Standard USB) cable and have accessed both 16 and 32gb USB flash drives. I have had a little trouble reading the flash drives a couple of times but suspect that it is more the cable than the tablet that is at fault.  I have ordered another, hopefully better, cable.  The touch screen works well with the exception of some difference in where you touch the screen and where it registers on the screen.  This seems to be mostly around the edges of the screen.  Once I turned on the option (in the system settings) that shows a blue dot where your touch is registering I soon learned how to compensate. There have been some minor glitches here and there, but nothing that was more than a minor issue and certainly nothing more than one might expect from ANY computer.I had intended to purchase a keyboard case for the tablet but decided that the screen keyboard worked well enough so as not to need one.  I did purchase a basic case made by Poetic. The first one did not fit properly even though it was said to be for the MID7048-4 as it covered up part of the RH side of the screen.  I returned it and ordered another case also made by Poetic which did fit well and which I am quite happy with.  That case is an ASIN: B00ANGOIR2 (product number).  If you are interested in a case do an Amazon search for B00ANGOIR2 and it should bring it up.  It did at the date of this review.One more thing, do not step on the tablet.  Mine slipped off of the bed and I did not realize it until the crunch.

He has dominated his Mom's IPad so I though it was time for him to get his own and the price was right. I opened it before giving it to him to set it up with games and educational software. Although the reviews for this tablet are mixed, it really depends on what you want to do with the tablet and how much you want to spend. The display is just okay with a resolution of 800x600 and it's a little dim for me. It has a front-facing 0.3 mega-pixel camera - okay for a child. The tablet runs Android 4.0, has 1Gb RAM and a 1GHz processor. It weights 24 ounces, has an HDMI port, a micro SD card slot for up to 32GB of storage and a built-in microphone and speaker. The speaker was just okay and I didn't test the microphone. You don't have access to Google Play but can download apps from Amazon (after you install the Amazon app package) and also some free apps are included in the GetJar app that is installed. The battery charges pretty quickly and WiFi works fine (we didn't see the problems that others noted.)  At a price of less of $120, this is good first table for children and even some adults.

She has certain educational sites she has the kids use on a computer.  Since it is time to replace the computer we decided to try a tablet.First off.  She goes to the educational sites and guess what?  They won't work.  Have to download Adobe Flash.  But wouldn't you know Adobe flash won't download for this tablet.  So I got involved.  And I searched the internet, did everything suggested and flash would not install.  No browser supporting flash would install.  I could find no solution at all for this.  There is simply no way to view any website that uses Adobe Flash.  We are subscribed to Netflix and Xfinity.  So nether worked.Now I know that some of the reviews gave solutions for this issue.  And I tried them all. It doesn't work.  So if you can live without anything that uses Adobe Flash, then you shouldn't have a problem with this tablet.The other big, big issue is that it kept disconnecting from the wireless internet and we had to keep restarting.  We have had a this wireless setup for a long time with a number of devices hooked up to it over that time and nothing else ever had this issue.And for all of you thinking that rooting the table is the answer; that evidently only works sometimes and it voids the warranty.

As other reviewers suggested after my package arrived next day,i  immediately downloaded Amazon store app. I did this by selecting Amazon store app apk. http://www.amazon.com/gp/mas/get/android. That is the link that takes u right to the download. It downloaded fast with no issues and from the Amazon store i downloaded Dolphin hd browser,Netflix (which this tablet does play and well not laggy at all. loads lil slower then id like but movie streaming is seamless.) Yahoo mail app,Aim app, Weather channel app and Angry Birds Space and other assorted apps such as games and Amazon Kindle app for downloading books.All Downloaded with no issues and work fine. This is a pretty good E reader as well. There is a one Second Delay when u switch from Landscape to Portrait view but nothing to complain about. It is flash 11 enabled so u can watch you tube videos it does come with the app already loaded and on your home page and it can play videos from sites like solarmovie.so. As far as Facebook games it can play some but not all. So games like Farmville u will need to get Farmville express since the app was discontinued for some reason for which u can find easily by googling it. The Battery life is a little short as others reviewers did say i get about 3 hrs of battery life before it needs to be charged. Standby time is good however lasting easily 10hrs in standby mode. The camera is ok it is front facing and only 0.3 mp but it does have zoom and can take videos. I downloaded skype and skyped with it and built in mic and Camera are ok not great but  people could see and hear me well. Just not recommended in bright areas it will wash out the camera. The built in web browser is decent but i added Dolphin had which i like better Opera Mini is also a good browser. You cannot get Google Play or app store out of box. You could root this tablet and other reviewers have suggested ways to get it to work i did not try them however. Amazon app store plus other various free ware sites Such as getjar freewarelovers.com etc provide a lot of free apps that work fine. Getjar site is working again not all apps will download but most do and are free.  The screen is clear and bright resolution is very good. It is not laggy at all as of yet and when u type it doesn't have that annoying delay from what u type till it appears in your text block. it types very smoothly. All and all it is a good tablet for the 97 bucks u pay for it. I will update this status if any issues arise after i had it for a couple weeks.

It's perfect for getting on the internet, facebook, playing games, reading, and probably more things that I haven't figured out yet. I got this tablet to get on the internet at school between classes. It isn't as good as a laptop, but for about $115 I wouldn't expect it to be. The only problems I've had so far are (ironically) with the amazon appstore and the tablet has frozen up twice. The amazon appstore gets stuck, and you have to clear the data out and log back into your amazon account. The tablet has only frozen up when I was charging the device while using it. Lesson learned; don't do that. It charges nicely while off or in sleep mode; in fact, it seems to charge faster while in sleep mode. The battery does run down quickly with constant use but I can use it for about 3 hours a day and only have to charge it up at night. Don't freak because GetJar sucks and it doesn't have GooglePlay; get the amazon appstore and 1mobilemarket and you're set.

I replaced my Kindle Fire for this just to get Flash and other Android Apps. It loses a star because it doesn't access the Google Play store, but I found most of the free apps I was looking for on the Good E-Reader App store and some good paid apps on the Amazon Apps store.It loses another star because the tech support is lousy. After a week of using the tablet, it shut itself down (despite having a full charge) and wouldn't power up or reset when I followed the manual trouble shooting instructions. I replaced it with Amazon's return policy, and had the same symptoms a week after getting a replacement. Ready to give up, I called the customer support from the manufacturer, and they didn't have a clue. What neither the phone customer support rep nor the manual mentioned is that there's a tiny paperclip reset button on the side next to the HDMI port. It fixed my power problem. It was mentioned on their website, but it should have been in the manual and the phone support rep should have known about it. I shouldn't have had to keep digging for that answer.The Amazon App store is buggy on it. The Apps purchased from the store seem to periodically uninstall themselves randomly, causing you to have to re-download them. Every time I exited it or shut down the tablet, the App interphase disappears. I had to clear the data and re-register just to get it working again.  And then I had to manually delete the old registrations from my Amazon account online. One good thing about the bug, the purchased apps work despite the disappearing app store interphase problem, which was fine with me because there is no way to sign out of the app store or restrict my kids from purchasing apps once I've registered. I found that an older version of the Amazon app store worked on the tablet, but still didn't have a feature allowing users to sign out, so I re-installed the version with the disappearing app store interphase bug, just to keep my kids from purchasing apps. Amazon needs to fix both the disappearing interphase problem and include a feature to either sign out or restrict the purchasing of apps. The way the store works now, it only restricts existing in-app purchasing, but not the purchasing of new apps.", "Date": "January 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Purchased the COBY 7048", "Author": "Robert M.

The 1125 had been my workhorse tablet and this looks to be a good replacement. I appreciate the full-sized usb slot added, and having the latest version of the Android OS is great.The frame of the 1125 seemed a bit more durable as the 1042 has a more plastic-like finish in its construction, but that appears to makes it lighter and that is useful for a 10-inch tablet.  The loss of the 1125's various fixed button controls on the face-frame is no big deal as I often pressed them by accident when changing grips while reading.Resolution is not the greatest, but it works very well as a comic reader.  Perfect Viewer was quite fast in both display and taking in a large collection of comics, so the machine does not feel underpowered at all.Aldiko and other useful apps come pre-installed.  No significant bloat.As warning to prospective buyers, while Coby tablets lack the official Google apps and marketplace, the 1125 Kyros could easily have these added by just installing a few files, without need for rooting or any tinkering with the OS.  The 1042 however cannot install Google Play, the Gmail app, etc with similar ease.  I tested instead the GetJar app marketplace offered and found it quite lacking.  Several favorite apps that I had read GetJar carried could however not be found.  Sure, you can get Angry Birds, but no Perfect Viewer, no Cool Reader.  But the Amazon marketplace installed without problem, and so did the SlideMe and GoodeReader markets, so I could get all the free apps I sought.Navigation of the file system is a bit clumsy.  Unlike in my Coby Kyros 7 incher, the file manager did not show me in easy to access fashion the contents of my slotted 16GB SD card.  I had to go and look for it in the \"mnt\" folder.  Once the apps had the path saved it proved no problem anymore, but I wonder if my having just moved over the card from my older 1125 without cleaning its contents cause that.

Really easy to move data/music on and off.  Like not having to mess with ITunes account.  We also bought the 9\" model and like it just as well.Dislike:  camera is not very good.  Have had some difficulty getting a connection at certain wifi spots.  Also my son had othe same 10\" model.  He tried to install some of the bigger games on it and it crashed.  After spending some time on the phone with Tech suport we had to send it back.  (by the way, Coby Tech Support were great!)

The Browser is nice..it's tabbed for multiple page viewing. And having the 10 inch screen has it's advantages. I seldom have to zoom in to read something. I do have trouble viewing flash video in the browser...it just won't do it or I haven't figured it out yet. It does come with a You Tube viewer though and it works nicely.

It isn't an iPad for sure but it works for me...and at a great price, too.5-21-2013...After using it for a few months I have changed my rating from 4 to 1. It was OK as far as reading books and documents, and playing most apps. I had some problems with it though. It gets to where it takes 2 - 5 minutes to load a web page. I called Tech support (no problem getting through)and they told me to try a full reset. I hated to do that because it meant that I would have to re-install ALL of my apps but I did it anyway. It worked so I was happy with it for a short while until it started doing the same thing again. I called them back and they sent me a email explaining how to return it...to include the receipt and a $15.00 money order for return shipping. What really gets me is they state that it will be 6 to 8 weeks to process the claim...WHY SO LONG? It's been 3 full weeks since they received it so I just called and they told me that it still hasn't been entered into the system and that it will probably be a couple more weeks until it does. I'm sorry...that's just unacceptable. Well...I hope I get it back someday. In the mean time I bought a Samsung Galaxy 2 and am enjoying it immensely.8-14-2013...I wish there was a minus star that I could check. I will never buy another Coby device again. It has now been almost 4 months since I returned my tablet to Coby for warranty repair. I WAS able to contact customer care by phone...now even that is unavailable to anyone. You call the PUBLISHED phone number on their website and you get a recording telling you to go to cobyusa.com where the only option you have is to email them...so I did. I have emailed them twice asking them to simply return my tablet. After weeks I have yet to receive even a confirmation that they received my email. I wish I could understand how a company as successful as Coby is could deal with a customer in this manner.I must give Amazon some high praise here. I copied them the last email that I sent Coby. I got an email back from Amazon within hours of when I sent it apologizing for the problem that I have suffered with Coby. Not only that...they have refunded the entire amount that I purchased the tablet for, including tax and shipping. Amazon...you are a class act!

I was impressed the battery was fully charged when I took it out of the box. That was a thoughtful gesture from Amazon. No problems so far. Very fast connecting with Wi-fi and I already put it 18 movies (via 32gb micro sd) and worked well. It has some apps already installed (basics), but lots of possibilities to advance for more apps out there. I bought this mainly for email checking and watching movies. The battery lasted at least 6 hours of movie watching (surprisingly). The only cons is the resolution, 800 x 480.  This could have been a perfect tablet if the resolution is higher; but for a tablet priced less than $100 bucks, you can never go wrong. I compared this tablet for my Blackberry Playbook which I already own (purchased 2 months ago), this Coby Kyros Mid-7048-4 is faster and more RELIABLE than the Playbook.

So i looked around on the internet and found that this is a problem with the tablet. I also found a solution. A tech advised to reboot the system and erase factory files.

I was also able to down load pretty much every app the Google Play Store has. They even have the Google Play Store app. Anyways, after doing this my tablet runs smoother, seems to be faster and everything works. Took this tablet from a 3 to a 5 star. I now love this tablet.

The major thing is that tablets need a lot more charging than e-ink readers do. I had an Android smartphone a while back before deciding it wasn't worth the monthly plan charges so the OS wasn't a problem. So the Coby Kyros seemed to fit the bill for my needs: it comes with Aldiko ebook reader already installed so I don't even need to be online to get my main use out of it. It's relatively cheap too. It's easy enough to plug into my PC, load up my music, ebooks and movies. I had no major issues with the software as I only wanted an ereader functionality everything else was bonus. There was some stutter here and there while reading books and it would not import some larger pdf file books with lots of pictures but this could be an Aldiko thing. I ran movies and music off my 32gb micro sd card as there's not much room for a lot of those type of files on this, no problems running any of that.I was able to put most of my epub library on there no problem. Aldiko was fairly easy to import my books into once I knew which folder to put them in so it would read the books. I found it to be great for epubs, not that great for pdf's. I particularly liked the feature where it switched the exposure on screen for night reading as it's much easier on the eyes and probably uses less energy since most of the screen is black other than the words. The 16:9 aspect ratio is not the best for holding this as a book for long periods of time I have to say. Also they put the power/vol buttons right where you hold one side of it when in portrait mode for reading, not the best thing but it's not a deal breaker either. It does seem to kick the heat out around there too as my hands got sweaty while reading.I can't comment on the internet part of this since I don't have wifi at home and never needed it while I owned this. The touch screen was pretty responsive. The micro USB port needs to be better positioned as it EASILY gets knocked out while plugged in. I also didn't see a \"charging\" symbol when it was plugged into the PC via USB so I'm not sure if it was charging that way or not, it did fine with the dedicated charger though.I received it from warehouse deals and it was supposed to be in like new condition. Well it was not, the plastic case had a crack down the back that was already half way down and so I returned this for a refund. Coby needs to either use harder plastics, metal or work on their structural design for this item. I went ahead and got another brand and model in the same price range as this one that also has an ereader app as well as has Google play store pre-installed. Pass on this and get a play store item that's designed to be more sturdy for not much more in price. I'm using an efun/walmart nextbook 7\" for the same price brand new as this tablet is used and it's much more sturdy with 8gb of onboard storage and google play, much better.", "Date": "July 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "customer service does not exist", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2ZKBC1T2VA80K", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I had to send my tablet in to be repaired.

Its reasonably fast for the money, and it has a decent battery life. However it has some issues. Because most apps won't allow you to install to an external SD card, you are STUCK with the meager 4gb of storage space. It has NO out of the box Google Play support. This can be remedied, but at the risk of possibly bricking your tablet. While it plays most of Glu Mobile's swankier games just fine, you won't be playing larger, beefier games, due to the limited specs and low storage space. So don't get this tablet if you're wanting to play the likes of NOVA 3 or the Modern Combat series on your big screen. Mine developed a glitch that kept disabling the internal storage, and eventually had to get a refund. That might not happen to everyone's, but buyer beware.So there you have it.

IT IS NOT NECESSARY. Simply use the tablet browser to go to the getjar app website and download the getjar app. When you get the getjar app, download the \"good e-book reader\" app. Another great appstore is called mobile 1 app store. Between the three of these appstores, you have access to almost all of the nicer apps that google play has. Mobile 1 appstore has probably the best selection for a google play alternative. Also, get rid of the default browser and get yourself dolphin browser. The default browser is so and crashes frequently, but the problem is solved simply by installing a different browser.

WTH??? another NOT. do not get it. it will have no port to plug it into. i ordered a male to male usb adaptor, does not work with it either. i then got a mini usb version of the same keyboard/case, does not work, as the actual port on the side of the tablet is MICRO USB. NOT mentioned in the description, it only lists USB. i had to spend countless hours online and read bunch of reviews suggesting the class of this port to figure out what it was - because the manufacturer does not say it. i even called them, and their agent would not classify the type of connection this has - she just said, it is one of their \"proprietary\" ports? WHAT????so, by far, tablet works surprisingly good for $100. deceptive USB connectivity in the description though. one of my tablets was already sent to the family member before i figured out the above, so the keyboard was a waste of money there... i still  have #2 here and am determined to  make sure the accessories i bought for it work - few more days before i get the replacement MICRO usb keyboard/case. i will post an update if keyboard works or not.UPDATE - 1/15/12Finally, i was able to find a keyboard that works with this thing. it is the \"DIAOTEC (TM) Synthetic Leather Keyboard Case with micro-USB plug for 7 inch Tablet Computers\" which i purchased from here for $13.

Up until Tuesday morning, it wouldn't connect to the wi-fi. Every other electronic equipment in my house works fine (and i have at least 3), but this tablet won't connect. It keeps saying \"Out of range\" when I'm sitting only 7 feet from the router.I called Coby on Tuesday morning, and was told to reset the device. It worked fine for about 2 minutes, then same problem started again. It won't connect to the wi-fi!I've only had it for 4 days, so i'm going to give it another 3 days before i send it back.The 9-inch form factor is perfect for me (thus the 2 stars), but the thing has to work!PS: They advertise it as being 1lb, put i put it on a scale, and it's actually 1.25 lbs.Will update soon...*Update 1: June 6, 2012 2-stars rating changed to 3So I returned the first unit to Amazon, and got a replacement. It took 1 hour and $50 for my ISP provider to make the tablet connect to the home wi-fi.Calling Coby customer care for over an hour did not resolve the issue.I had to pay $50 to my ISP provider for them to figure it out for me because the tablet is not their product.I also noticed that the tablet does not come with flash player already installed, so some websites do not work. I've downloaded a flash player from Getjar, yet still no success. I have to spend another half hour or so with their customer service today so they can tell me what to do.So overall this tablet cost me $250, which is 50 bucks way more than I was willing to pay for it. If you add in the over 2 days spent trying to get it to do the number one thing i bought it for (connect to internet), that irks.Depending on the wi-fi settings in your house or wherever you try to connect, this unit might not work. Whereby my old HP Touchpad connects everywhere, every time, without a hitch.**Update 2: June 11, 2012 - 3 stars rating changed to 2I finally found a flash player that works, but it only works with the native browser, not the Google chrome browser that i downloaded.I had to do my own research online to find the right Flash player, because Coby customer support was completely useless. The version that they suggested that i use didn't work, and they became very dismissive over the phone and rushed me off the phone when they saw that what they were suggesting wasn't working. Sad!So all and all, I will go from 3 stars rating to 2 stars because i shouldn't have gone through all that i went through to have this tablet do the No. 1 thing I bought for.It costs me overall $250, too much of my time and a lot of frustration.***Update 3: June 27, 2012 - 2 stars rating changed to 3; Would have given 3.5 if it was possible.Everything now works, except it's very slow. My small laptop with half the Ram of this tablet processes things faster. The tablet is very slow, no matter in what application I'm in, no matter how many applications are running at the same time. The sound is very low as well, so i use the headphones a lot.Not being able to use my Google calendar in it sucks big time! I removed the Google chrome browser and replaced it with Dolphin HD. Much better.So all and all, it took 3 weeks of troubleshooting, extensive internet search, hours over the phone with Coby CS, 2 returns and exchanges to have this thing work properly.If you plan to do anything other than basic internet surfing, you will get frustrated with this tablet if you don't have tons of patience.", "Date": "May 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Stay away", "Author": "Dolemite", "ReviewID": "R3AYI7LV3RE1BB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Let me first start by saying that this device is terrible.  Ok, now here is why.1. It is running 4.03 without access to play store.  For some this is not an issue, but most people need apps.  When you hear of an app that you really want, be prepared to not be able to get it.  They give you an app store called get jar, which is a joke.  Get jar has no apps at all.  With some Androids you can manually load Play Store, but this device is locked down.  Impossible.2.  This device is locked down.  I could not even browse files on my own SD card, let alone play a movie or listen to music on my SD card.  When I tried to download a file browser from crap jar I could not find one, but then again I could not search for one.  Every search that actually managed to work came back with the same results.  If I searched for butter I would get angry birds, if I searched for word processor I would get angry birds.  Crap Jar3.  The screen has an issue.  When I would run searches on the web, it would erase what I entered in the search bar when I pressed the search button.  This happened on several different sites, which means that it is the browser or the tablet, and being as I cannot load a different browser I have to live with it.4.  The device is fast, but that is because there is nothing on it.Complete junk.Oh and you might want to carry around a pair of toe nail clippers to get the SD card in and out as regular human fingers just dont seem to cut it.Oh and the usb port is an off standard, so dont go thinking you can use any cables you already own.", "Date": "August 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "I had this for a week", "Author": "V. mills \"vmia16\"", "ReviewID": "RIIPYD5B51GEL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "and it broke.

Word processing and lots of apps, no.", "Author": "Kellena", "ReviewID": "R25JCMPOI0WIRY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am a student with no laptop and no smartphone.  I have been trying to save money for a tablet for a while, and then received an Amazon gift certificate for Christmas.  This was the only tablet that was completely covered by the gift certificate, and after much soul-searching I decided to \"spend it all in one place\" and go for it.  I am thrilled to be able to see my school's website and class power points on the go - however, it took a lot to get there.The touch screen and on screen keyboard are better than expected.  The wi-fi is intuitive and excellent.  The pre-installed web browser was not supported by my college's online program at all.  I tried installing Chrome (the suggested browser) - however, as noted in most other reviews, this tablet cannot access google play, and play is the only place to download chrome.  So I tried installing firefox from Mozilla's website - which redirected me to google play.  I searched the pre-installed app store - GetJar - however NOTHING I attempted to download from there would work, it would give me an error message.  So then I installed Amazon apps.  That got me *some* apps (many are not even available for download onto this tablet)... however, every time I exited out of Amazon apps and then tried to enter back into it, the appstore wouldn't load and would give me only a black screen and search bar that did nothing.  I worked around this by uninstalling and re-installing Amazon apps each time I wanted to use it, which was tedious.  Meanwhile, I still couldn't get a browser that worked on my school website.  So, all I could do was check my email and facebook, and view pictures from my sd card.  Definitely not worth $100.  A friend found a link to download firefox after some serious searching.  Once I installed firefox, I was able to connect to my school's website and view our online syllabi and power points, but each time a screen loads it still gives me an error message that I must click out of.  That raised this from two stars to three.  Finally, I found. on the Coby wesite, instructions on how to get GetJar to work (you have to access GetJar from the Coby website, not the widget that comes pre-installed).  However, the GetJar site ended up not being worth any of the hassle.  But, Pandora installed and works great.  I can read any office document, but need to pay $15 if I want to be able to CREATE anything, inlcuding any word documents.  Back down to two stars.  I ordered a keyboard/case, and then a usb-to-mini-usb adapter to make it work, and it hooked up instantly and worked with no problems, so that brought it back to three stars.  I am planning on trying the reset described in an earlier review and hoping that google play will then work - but I am not holding my breath.Another serious problem that I have not yet solved is its complete refusal to record sound.  It plays songs fine, but the camera (front facing only, so can really only be used for skyping and the like) is very poor quality, and will NOT record sound.  An email to Coby customer support has gone unanswered.  Apps that have high star ratings don't work either.  So no recording of class lectures with this baby!If you need the ability to compose word documents you will have to pay for an upgrade to the pre-installed office program at $15.  If you want to record sound it will cost you more - perhaps a microphone, or better yet a completely different gadget at $30 or more.  If you want to take pictures, again you will have to buy a different gadget - either a phone with a camera or a camera itself - this one has its camera facing the screen and is poor quality and zero flash.  But if you want to be able to surf the web and check your email on a screen larger than a phone, this one will do it.In summary, had I been able to afford a slightly more new-technology or bigger brand tablet, I would never give this tablet a second thought.  However, considering that if this tablet had not been available I wouldn't have one at all, it isn't all THAT bad.  Better than having none at all, but if you can afford a slightly higher quality brand, do so.", "Date": "January 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "BROKEN", "Author": "Cherie Shepard", "ReviewID": "RZ9R5RFAWF71W", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "i bought a keyboard for it and it broke the port office depot said it was a manufacturing error for not being put together properly but coby wont replace it DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!", "Date": "January 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Waste of money - doesn't work", "Author": "xxhurley82xx", "ReviewID": "R1LWCK1XBTPVOI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought it for my daughter for Christmas.

I have used amazon in the past and my boyfriend orders stuff off amazon religiously, but now we are both very unsatisfied.  I do not plan on ordering from Amazon anymore.  I would rather pay the extra money to have a good product I know will be good.  This was a terrible experience I am not willing to take again.  VERY UNHAPPY customer.  :(  I will get a refund for the tablet and never shop on here again.  I thought we actually found an awesome website, but we can't trust it.", "Date": "December 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Boo!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3KP3RHH7PSL6T", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This product is poor. I bought this for my 9year old son thinking, it's not to spendy, I'll give it a try! I think many parents think the same. DON'T get it! Unless your child did something horrible and you want to punish them by severe disappointment!It has a sub par app store called, get jar. It has junk apps. You can't get google play off of it to make it better. I had to go to amazon and download their app store, it's ok but it's not google play.Getjar also doesn't have Netflix.Oh and by the way it's super buggy, it says if it won't turn on(and at some point it won't, take a paper clip to the reset button. Did that and it still wouldn't turn back on.)A working tablet is a must,having an app store that isn't junk also a must. If you just want to surf the web, watch YouTube or check email you may be happy with it, if it doesn't stop working. Oh, the fb app is junky too...We are Returning it  and spending  the extra money on a better tablet. Nexus 7 or a kindle fire hd.This is not worth the frustration.
