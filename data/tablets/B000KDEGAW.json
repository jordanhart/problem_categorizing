{"Reviews": [{"Title": "reconditioners stripped all tablet functions!!!", "Author": "M.", "ReviewID": "R3MCORA0VJB7Y8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this \"reconditioned\" T4210 tablet PC for teaching so I could make notes while giving the lecture and then post those notes for the students. Unfortunately, the reconditioners loaded a version of Windows XP that states it is for reconditioned PCs, but it was not the version of Windows XP for Tablet PCs. So there are no tablet functions available. In addition, almost all the original software which came with the Fujitsu T4210 is missing. So I can't be sure (even if I _now_ upgrade to Windows 7), whether I will be able to restore tablet PC functions. So basically, the claim that this was a reconditioned Tablet PC was a fraud. BEWARE. It deserves ZERO stars instead of 1 star, but I couldn't figure out how to give it a zero.
