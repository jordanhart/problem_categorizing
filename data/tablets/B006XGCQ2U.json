The tablet has worked all fine and great until just recently. When I say recently I mean 2 weeks after the 1 years warranty expired. It also seems many other users/customer are experiencing the same problem. The problem is the screen or digitizer goes crazy, and it appears the glue used to hold it down isnt good enough, like at the bottom edge. the screen becomes un usable.. apps opening on their own, cant press keys or letters on keyboard. as with other users its same symptoms along the bottom edge of screen is problem. press there slightly and apps will open close etc etc. I contacted Acer support, no recalls, no known defects known of this type..support rep, said my warranty expired, and basically SOL. So I paid for this tabled 350$ used it maybe 6 times when traveling over past year now it is junk. Unacceptable!! Contacted Acer support again requested to speak with level 2 support. Finally they admitted that this is a known problem and would repair the tablet at no cost to me and even though its passed out of warranty.", "Date": "March 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Almost 5 stars!", "Author": "David", "ReviewID": "RFVUDIOOF79JV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is an incredible product.  I've had very few problems with it, most likely due to the heavy usage and many apps I have installed.  My pro's and con's are below:pro:1)  I have an android phone.  I was able to access my google account on the tablet and download all of my apps (free and paid) onto the tablet at no cost.2)  The screen is vivid, colors great, and speed incredible3)  The battery life is INSANE!  I just finished a 10 hour trans-atlantic flight and watched .mpg movies on my tablet for over 9 hours of the flight.  I loaded them onto memory cards and used a program called Mobo to watch them.  I did turn the screen brightness most of the way down to conserve power.Con:1)  Does not drip charge or usb charge.  No way to charge it except to plug it into a 110 outlet.  I don't know if there is a car adapter that works for it, I've seen some advertised, but they looked hokey so I didn't try them.2)  Does not recognize SD card or jump drive data that was not put on through the tablet system.  I had to USB connect to my computer to move files to and from the memory and cards in order to have them available for later use.  This means, you can't take the camera memory card and download the contents to the tablet.  Seems like it would be a simple software update if the manufacturer wants to get 5 stars.

Let me elaborate...Pros:Fast! Dual Core Nvidia Tegra 2 processor.  Handles the web, games, music, whatever you can throw at it, pretty well!It has a crisp, beautiful screen.  Video looks great and has enough pixels per inch to make reading with the Kindle app pretty easy as well.Ice Cream Sandwich for this tablet is out.  Few days after I received the tablet the ICS upgrade was rolled out.  I have been using Android since 2.0 and it has come a long way.  This tablet handles ICS well with no hiccups.The front camera is decent.  As for a front facing cam, it gets the job done.The grippy back is a nice touch! This backing makes the tablet feel good in your hands.  I feel as if I was to accidentally drop it would leave a dent in the ground.  Maybe not that strong but it is well built.  No creaks.Full size USB port is a nice touch.No problems with Wi-Fi or GPSNow the cons:No back cam.  Not a big deal unless you are into looking a frigging TOOL holding up a 10.1 tablet taking videos and pictures.No HDMI port.  I was willing to work with the included DLNA software named \"Clear.fi\".THE MIC AND SPEAKERS SUCK SO BAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I was actually able to deal with the speakers after download an app called \"Volume+\".  Then I tried to video chat for the first time and the person on the other end repeatedly told me they could not hear a thing I was saying.  I thought it was either their equipment or a connection error.  I then recorded a video of myself speaking  at a higher volume than I would normally speak at and played it back and I couldn't hear anything but feedback.  I looked like a mime and sounded like I was in a windstorm.  Thinking that it was the crappy speakers I then sent the video to my Galaxy S2 and played it on there.  The recording sounded exactly the same.  Recorded a video of myself on the Galaxy S2 to hear what I should sound like cause I still wanted to justify that maybe that was how a mic should sound but I was completely clear on the S2.  Even sent that video that was recorded on the GS2 over to the a200 and the tinny speakers managed to broadcast my voice with no feedback.All in all, if you use this tablet with headphones and you are not into video chat then it is a steal.  Web surfing, email, and videos were great! I just believe that if you strip down all the features to put out a cost efficient device then the features you leave in better be fully functional.  In case you're wondering what I got instead, I went with the Asus Transformer Prime.  I'm going with all the bells and whistles this time and will review that one as well...", "Date": "February 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Tablet", "Author": "Tim A.

HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN?) and some off brand tablet called Cruz (Don't get me started...). I can honestly say that I have never been happier. The hardware itself is fantastic, with specs identical to the A500 (minus the 5.0 megapixel camera, but then again, who wants to take photos with a slab of glass?) and most other Honeycomb (Android 3.0) tablets. I prefer this tablet to the iPad 2 I used for several months. I feel like I have a full computer in my bag! The full USB port is a fantastic option to have, I can see myself using it for a 3G card (if they are supported I do not know.)The modifications made over stock Honeycomb really help make the user end experience unique, with it's different and interesting method for multitasking.Also, the thing launched at the end of last month and Acer is already preparing an ICS (Ice Cream Sandwich, or Android 4.0 to you non geeks) rollout? I love how supported this device is, even in its infancy.So, if you're looking at Android tablets for a certain price range, pick up an A200.

Its too slow, no hdmi, it's a new tablet why wouldn't they use a newer gen quad core processor, too much screen glare, No rear facing camera.I was in the market to get a Kindle, just a run of the mill basic reader, then I thought that maybe I could find a similarly priced tablet that I could do more with in my price range (under $200) For it to not be a kindle I had a few requirements. It had to be at least a dual core 1ghz processor, it had to be a 10\" tablet (so I could use a larger font, I have a horribly bad astigmatism, and so I could watch the occasional netflix video when out and about instead of squinting at my phone) had to be able to use some form of media card (I really wanted SD but it seams everything now has gone to micro sd) and it had to be a reliable brand and not some Chinese knock off.So this tablet fit my requirements, and then some. It had a regular USB port and a micro USB (yay I can charge my phone off it or tether it to my phone to use its internet connection) it was 10\", had a fast enough processor, a decent graphics chipset, microSD, all in all it wasn't fast and furious, but it was more than a kindle and best of all, $165 Factory Refurb from Acer (I got it on Amazon from an amazon dealer but Acer did the actual refurb) I found a great case and screen protector for $10 as well. I've noticed that yes the unit is just about unuse-able outside unless you are under a porch or the weather is clouded over, and yes if a light is in a bad angle the glare is pretty bad, but these are things I decided when I got it that for the price I could live with.The only downside I've found is that if you over tax the unit it can and will lock up and need a restart, and if you need to pull the battery for any reason (like to replace and old worn out one) it isn't the easiest task. That isn't a whole lot of complaint for all the good I've got to say about it though.All in all for me this was an Excellent unit for only $65 more than a bottom of the line kindle, yeah the kindle would be easier to use outside or against bad lighting, but I wanted to read in bed and this way I can do it with the light off. I can also netflix, use facebook, play angry birds, and roam the internet. all in all for me this was the PERFECT tablet, your mileage may very but all I can do is say first you need to make your list of needs, and what you'd like but can live without, and RESEARCH! This way you will spend the least amount of money for the most amount of happiness, and for me this acer was it!", "Date": "April 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great tablet - However, Buyer beware", "Author": "JW", "ReviewID": "R2IK8HUMQIMFZO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Acer A200 overall is a good tablet. However, in working with Acer Support in trying to resolve a minor problem, I discovered something all potential Acer customers ought to know.Acer has officially announced they will not be upgrading the operating system on A100, A200 & A500 devices beyond Android 4.0.3 - Ice Cream Sandwich. There will be no Jelly Bean - Android 4.1 or Android 4.2 upgrade!The good things about this tablet are:1)Though not the fastest tablet on the market, nor does it have the highest video resolution - considering what I paid for it, (I bought it on sale for $225), it does a great job for the price.2) You can download and install apps from Google Play, the Amazon App Store, as well as other sites. Thus, there are literally thousands of apps in all categories one can utilize.3) The video is more than suffice to watch movies, TV shows, etc from Netflix, Amazon Instant Video, etc. in HD.4) You can connect a keyboard, mouse, or an external speaker via bluetooth.5) You can easily customize it - background photo, and app and widget layout - to your liking.6) This tablet is also good enough is serve as a backup for my desktop.The negatives are:1) No android upgrades will be available for this tablet beyond android version 4.0.3.2) After setting up the tablet to work with my bluetooth keyboard & mouse, now - even with bluetooth turned off - the tablet defaults to the physical keyboard, instead of the built-in one. Thus, after turning on the tablet, I have to manually set it to use the android keyboard.3) At random times and for no apparent reason, the tablet loses it WiFi connection. This can be easily fixed by turning WiFi off and turning it back on and reconnecting to your network. But, at least for me - it does seemed to be an unnecessary hassle that so far, Acer Customer Support has not been able to resolve without me sending them the tablet.4) And lastly - With all tablets running android 4.0.3 and newer, while you can store documents, music, photos, backup of your apps, etc. on an SD card, you cannot move an installed app from main memory to your SD card and run the app. Thus, your main memory is all you have for installing and running apps. This used to be a greatly memory saving feature in Android version 2.3.Considering the fact that most people upgrade whatever tablet they buy to a newer one about every two years anyway, I would recommend the Acer A200. Just don't be disappointed when you cannot download and/or install the latest/greatest version of Android on it.", "Date": "November 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "FIts my needs perfectly", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2601L8FPGQ9PJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Received my Acer today....very happy with it.  I am a couch surfer, a casual user.  Absolutely no reason to spend $500 or $400 when my basic needs can be met with a $300 device.The display is perfectly fine to my unprofessional eyes...I'm sure if you placed an Asus Transformer next to it I would notice the difference, but I'm not testing devices for a living.  The screen is a first-rate LCD 1280...l don't watch movies or play games on mobile devices...no reason to buy a Kindle Fire 8.9 inch when I can get a 10 inch for the same money.  I have a first generation Fire for reading in my bedroom at night...used to pop it in my purse going out to the coffee shop, but will take my Acer instead so I'm not going up and down the stairs.  Did download the Kindle app  so all my books are there if I want to read.  Email was snap to set up.  Downloaded Opera, Dolphin, and Chrome....Firefox didn't handle videos well.  I too downloaded a speaker booster app, plugged in a small external speaker that sits on the coffee table, problem solved.  Love ICS.My needs are simple and a higher priced tablet would have been overkill.  The reviews did say for the money this is a great tablet and they are right...so glad I did not shell out the extra bucks.FYI:  I have the screen brightness all the way down...I mean completely at zero and it is still plenty bright and clear.  I did order an anti glare screen protector, that may help...I am sensitive to glare.Downloaded flash player, can listen to HOS.  Had this device abt a week now...my laptop is gathering dust.

This is my third tablet, I have had a Pandigital and a Le Pan and out of all three this tablet is far superior to the others.  It is so easy to use and the graphics are fantastic. I did a lot of research before buying this and I have to say I am thoroughly pleased that I bought this.  I am a very avid reader and I love reading books on this, what I also love is that I am not limited on books I can get.  Although I do use it for other things, I do mainly use it for reading.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an ereader or a tablet, I would buy this over the Ipad in a heartbeat!! The expandable memory is awesome for recording movies and taking along camping, or to sporting events to keep my kids entertained.  The videos play without problems and graphically are really clear and the battery life is amazing!!! So if you are looking for a very affordable, durable, wonderful tablet, this is it. I have never left a review on either of the other tablets that I had, but couldn't wait to on this. I bought the Metallic Red and absolutely love it, plus it matches my favorite colleges' colors.

My phone has a camera and I actually have a piece of electronics made to be nothing but a camera (Imagine that?) I bought this because I wanted a tablet to work on email, read Kindle books, surf the internet, communicate on ooVoo or Skype video and watch movies. It is outstanding for all these applications. The full sized USB is something I use constantly. The screen is very clear and easy to work on. The tactile response of the screen for typing and sending email is about as sensitive as I would like it. The WiFi reception is very good and the Android ICS (4.0)that it came with seems reasonable. I can't really comment on Android ICS. This is my first tablet and what I can say is that if Windows 8 is as good as I hear it is, I would not want anything but a windows type OCS. This is not a critique of the A200, but Android seems somewhat intuitive but a tablet is not a phone and there is a lot about the interface that doesn't make sense.

I went to Best Buy to see if they had a different tablet in stock and ended up buying this Acer 200 instead.  I am very happy with it so far.  I also did some research - probably 6 months worth.  I have a laptop for work but I as not able to easily connect to Audible, Kindle and Zinio because the work network had them blocked.  I just wanted to be able to read my beading magazines and listen to my audible books and read my kindle books and watch movies and TV shows and movies and play games like solitaire and mahjongg.  It took a bit to get the wifi set up - but I think that is partly to do with my mi-fi card.  This table already had Zinio and Kindle installed - they are working great.I had one must have option that I wasn't going to compromise on - (hint to Amazon on the Kindle Fire -Micro SD) I wanted to make sure I had some kind of extra storage.  The Acer 200 has that slot.  The main thing that put me over the edge was it also has a USB port that you can connect a mouse o keyboard into as well as a thumb drive or external hard drive.  It also has Honeycomb installed which is one of the newer Android OS's.This tablet has a good feel - feels well built.  It has a textured back so fingerprints on that back side won't be a problem.  I have not yet signed into my Amaon Prime account yet so I am not sure how movie and tv show downloads will be but I assume there will be no problems.

This is a feature that's not native to most tablets & is most certainly a welcomed asset.The front facing camera is decent but not the best (Who buys a tablet for the camera anyway!?) & it lacks a rear-facing camera; again, not a big deal.The screen display is crisp with decent viewing angles & the touch response is good aswell.

I had the tablet in a protective case (Poetic(TM) Slimbook Leather Case for Acer Iconia A200 10.1-Inch Tablet (3 Year Manufacturer Warranty From Poetic) that by itself works very well (I recommend it), resting on a half-full backpack on a plush, soft carpet. I went to grab the tablet and it essentially slid about 3 inches onto its side on this soft carpet. I picked it up and the glass screen had two huge cracks in it and three small cracks. The tablet didn't work anymore.There were five other people in the room with me who couldn't believe it broke. It wasn't dropped hard at all and I think it fell/slid at an angle, too. I don't know if all tablets are like this (anyone know?). But as far as I'm concerned, that's a manufacturer's defect, because it was such a light drop/slide from such a small height.I then called Acer, because Amazon recommended calling them, and Acer wanted me to pay $99 to get it fixed. Luckily after I called Amazon back, Amazon is sending a replacement anyway. However, what I am definitely going to do now is to buy this 3-year warranty covering drops, spills, and power issues: SquareTrade 3-Year Tablet Accidental Protection Warranty ($300-350).

The bottom line is the 2 major things that sold me on this unit was the 10.1\" screen and the fact, according to Acer's own website, that the unit was capable of being wi-fi and/or bluetooth tethered via a tethering capable phone (which mine is).A couple of things happened while attempting tethering: 1) When trying to tether the unit via WiFi - the A200 does not even see the SSID (even tried to set it up manually to no avail), and 2) When attempting bluetooth tethering, the A200 actually shows that it is \"connected for internet\" via bluetooth when in fact it actually is not. I did a live chat with an Acer tech yesterday and after they had me go through their routine of resetting the A200 (which I had done prior to contacting them) - their final word was that it must be a problem with my tethering software. That would have been ok except that I also own a bluetooth enabled laptop and with the same software they are telling me is flawed - was able to tether my phone to my laptop for internet using BOTH methods (WiFi & bluetooth) with no problems whatsoever.The ability to do this was a must for whatever tablet I purchased so this thing is basically useless to me. Additionally, another problem that Acer does not wish to recognize about this product is when you attempt to shut bluetooth off, the unit simply hangs up for about 10 seconds - then reboots itself.The things I have mentioned here are discussed heavily in Acer's own forum, yet they refuse to acknowledge that the unit has issues. Not everyone's tethering program in their phone can be flawed and others, like me, report the same thing: able to tether to other units but not the A200.", "Date": "June 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "What I paid for...", "Author": "M.

The screen is bright but you should use a stylus to keep it clean. Don't know why they just didn't allow usb to charge. Little things, they just bother me... but this was for my wife and she likes it. However, she really finds not having a camera in the back just plain silly!", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Please do not buy", "Author": "Naveen", "ReviewID": "R1DPPSA81J0VE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After 3 days of usage.

If you want to here any sound you basically just have to use some earphones with the jack or be in a padded room. I have to say though besides that issue everything else is A+. I also have an A500, this one is thinner and I like the ring function shortcut that it has, I can't seem to get it on my A500 and they both run the same OS version. Also the A500 speakers work perfect!", "Date": "May 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "So many things right, but missing critical parts", "Author": "RanChanGT", "ReviewID": "RVG2IXMMGXJTV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a better design and overall just feels better than the A500. It's fast and it has a full size USB port just as the A500, but one critical component for me that this is missing the lack of a HDMI port. This eliminates the ability for me to do a presentation straight from the pad to projectors. This is a big miss on this model, especially if you're business oriented and presentations are a big part of your job. The lack of a back facing camera is also a miss too, as one of the best things about tablets is the big screen that you get to use as a view finder, but now that functionality is out the door. Really wanted to like this tablet, but those 2 things are critical for me.", "Date": "February 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Tablets are NOT real computers.Beware", "Author": "Tashekor", "ReviewID": "R1QFBZI06JA60A", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Problems:1. Can't use it as a \"flash drive\" because Windows doesn't recognize it as a device to save to when working with MS software on your main computer.  This makes it worse than a $10 flash drive.2. Software is buggy.  Icons that are supposed to exist on the home page to add apps are not there.3. Home page shuts down in about 2 seconds, requiring constant push-button re-starts4. USB port won't charge; you MUST connect with A/C adapter when working with it, or battery drains real fast.5. Get a netbook for about the same price with all the features you want.6. Won't run real MS Office, so you limp through any real work.7. No Return policy by manufacturers, so if when you've had it for a few days and realize its horrible shortcomings after working with it in a real-world situation, you're screwed, even if you want to upgrade to a real computer that actually works.8. This and apparently all other tablets are designed primarily for playing crappy video games like Angry Birds on a bigger screen. Your phone can do everything else at a fraction of the cost and weight.9.  I'm putting my A200 on ebay, and will probably loose 50% of the $300 Acer ripped me off for this useless piece of hardware10. Then I'm buying an HP netbook 10.1\" screen with true Win7 and all required ins/outs, for the same amount of money, that's the same size and weight (with optional keyboard), 100x the memory, and about $100 more.11. Don't make my mistake of listening to advisors who said a tablet is better than a netbook.12.  BTW, netbook sales and quality are rapidly increasing, as people discover the shuck and drive perpetrated by computer manufacturers trying to get people to get with the latest toy.13.  Now 7\" screen are the hot thing, and even worse than 10.1 in screens.  I looked at one, and said this piece of junk is 35% bigger than my phone and does nothing better, unless you want bigger pictures to look at-- whoopie.
