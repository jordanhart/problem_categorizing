{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Well designed, lack of Chrome default w/o jailbreaking, no Google Maps, only 1GB memory, false WIFI claims", "Author": "Edwin A. Mcgusty \"EddyMac71\"", "ReviewID": "RT8ZEN18U0YUX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As much as I didn't want to buy another iPad for my new tablet, Apple makes great hardware and has a nice, simple, stable operating system.  If they just stuck with that I'd never leave them.  Unfortunately I love my Google also and Apple is pulling an AOL by trying to make its customers be stuck with their apps.  We'll see how that works out for them, but they lost me as an iPhone customer because of it.That's my Apple rant :)  Moving on to the review, the 'new' new IPad, aka iPad 4, is nice and quick!  Had the original iPad and it became obsolete pretty quickly due to the small 256MB of memory - great for a game of freecell, but it couldn't hold more than a few web pages without having to do constant refreshes when you switch tabs, very annoying, hardly ever used it eventually.  Bought an iPad 3 for my girlfriend, she didn't like it and we returned it to buy $100 necklace which she loved.  Almost bought an iPad mini, cute size, then found out Apple only put in 512MB of memory - it can't handle many web pages without doing the annoying refresh thing either - already obsolete when it hit the shelves.  So iPad 4 had the nice high res screen and 1 gig of memory, still only half the 2 gigs that comparable Android tablets have, but that's why we'll all have to buy another tablet in a year or two rather than 3-4 years for any other electronic device - planned obsolescence, slightly annoying also.  I would do a Nexus 7 over the mini, but since I have an Android phone with a nice large screen (which I love compared to my iPhones), a Nexus 7 is too similar.So long story short, I like and use my iPad 4 a lot more than I thought I would, it's still currently the best tablet as of February 2013.  The higher res screen, although not a big difference in the store, is actually really nice once you get used to it.  My MacBook Air looks old now in comparison and I'll have to upgrade that when Apple adds the Retina display on the next generation.  Web pages look great, HD apps are more available now and I even use my iPad to read with the Kindle app ... although I suspect Apple will take that away from you at some point also, ha!  Greedy, oh well.  Best of all the iPad is very quick and has great battery life so far, using mostly for web browsing and not gaming.WIFI claim of double the speed - FALSE.  One of my big factors of getting the iPad was its claim of double the WIFI speeds as I want quick internet browsing.  No one at Apple Store knows how or why it will give you this or whether it will do it without special equipment like a new router.  So here is the deal - the new iPad gets HALF, not double, the WIFI speed of my three year old 2010 MacBook Air on the same (standard 2.4mhz) high speed cable modem WIFI router.  I get about 66Mbps (speedtest.net) on my 2010 MacBook Air and only about 32Mbps on the new iPad.  Tested it every way possible and the results only get worse if you adjust your router settings.  Long story short, you need to get a new dual band (2.4mhz & 5 mhz) router if you want to get the higher claimed speed, but the claimed speed is only in comparison to prior iPads.  Essentially buying a new router and going though the pain of setting that up with your ISP is the only way to get back to the wireless speeds Apple could do three years ago on a standard 2.4mhz WIFI router.  Browsing is fairly quick and will obviously depend on your broadband connection, but to claim double and then not even equal three year old speeds is a little annoying.In conclusion, with all the little issues that Apple makes me not like them as a company, they still do make great hardware and they have a stable operating platform.  If you are looking for a quick, smooth, full size tablet, the new iPad is hard to beat.  We'll see what the rest of 2013 has to bring.  As Android apps convert to full size tablet and HD over time, I think next year Apple will see a lot more competition.  All I want is my Google apps on my iPad, is that too much to ask for to keep me an Apple customer in the future?  Will have to go through the hassle of jailbreaking this to be able to make Chrome my default browser and then Apple will not allow updates, slightly annoying.  But, yes, it's a really nice tablet otherwise.", "Date": "February 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Beware Apple support", "Author": "Rob Haff", "ReviewID": "R1UNU7YAKVP7S3", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The ipad is a good product, but beware Apple support if you purchase online!  I believe it's a \"dirty little secret\"...when you purchase an Apple product on-line...it seems you are treated differently when it comes to support?  You decide....  After recieving my $800 defective Ipad in the mail, I was told by Apple Care on the phone to \"go to a store and they'll take care of it\", so I did so and drove for an hour to the closest Apple store in Miami.  So believe it or not,  I could not get a repair job OR replacement from that store...or any of the 4 stores in the Miami area!  How could this be I asked???  Maybe because I purchased my ipad from Amazon?  I couldn't get a straight answer from any of the folks at the store but when I asked if they actually did not have an ipad in the store to replace mine, the answer was \"warranty replacements come from a different inventory than ones for sale\".  And not one store in the greater Miami area had a \"Replacement\", according to them.  I was told my only option was to go to a UPS store, and mail it via ground to them, and then in a week or so they would send me a \"Replacement\".  Again, they could not tell me if it would be a new one, or a Refurb.  Very disappointing from one of the most profitable corporations in the world.  If I could do it again, I'd try a Samsung Tab.", "Date": "April 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Too many issues", "Author": "Jason M Parnes", "ReviewID": "R2UEDSGK0XUJQZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Let me start by saying that the mediocre rating on this product had nothing to do with the seller I went through.  I had several issues with the product when I first received the iPad, starting with a small issue of the home screen button not functioning properly.  This was then compounded into a larger issue by the Apple \"genius\" not being such of a genius and replacing my iPad with a new ones and not swapping my SIM card (this was after a 3 hour wait at the Apple store).  After several more hours on the phone with both Apple and Verizon, I was finally able to get them to over-night me a new SIM card and thought everything should be fine... wrong.The big issue I am now having is a \"No SIM card\" error, which I clearly do have as evidenced by the SIM card in my iPad.  I have done some Google searching and have noticed that many others are having the same issue.  My iPad will work great for some time and then give me that error and no longer let me connect to the internet through my Verizon service.All in all, when the iPad is working, its amazing, however when you pay >$700 for an item you expect it to work perfectly without having to lose hours of your time at the Apple store and on the phone.  The customer service Apple has provided to me during this time is also making me rethink my switch to Apple products.", "Date": "January 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing product and customer service", "Author": "T.

Rodrigues \"I'd rather be cycling\"", "ReviewID": "RC6W0KOEYKB3X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "On the plus side the IPad has a fast charge time, long battery life, good Wi-Fi, a robust cpu, and an excellent display. That said, it's not without some flaws and annoyances. Foremost, there's no consistent method to back navigate. Perhaps, this was one of those cases where design overrules function; in order to keep the device looking elegant they sacrificed functionality. The result is confusion and inconsistency. In some cases you find yourself navigating back via the app itself; however sometimes you need to use the home function or start swiping. For example, at one point I opened a PDF that was attached to an email but then I could not easily find a way to close the PDF to return to the inbox. There's no consistency as to where the back function is to be found or what it may be called. Often you are forced to make reaches across the screen whereas if there was one consistent placement for a back function you always know where it is. The same is true for getting a list of apps running in the background. You are forced to use a awkward four finger up motion.  Why not just give us a consistent button for a list of running apps?  I found the need to use 4 finger swipes annoying.. Another missing function is the cancel key. If you accidentally start to download a huge file and want to abort - where's the key to stop the download?  The app store is annoying as you can't search for apps in ways of your choosing. Why not offer advanced search that would give you some options to sort and filter?  Another issue I have with the device is its dependence on iTunes. Certain files cannot be removed from the device unless you are on iTunes, really? Why? I should be able to delete files off my device. I'm assuming there's an app for doing that but really - why not just make that part of the OS? Speaking of what's not included - why not include a free calculator? Do I really need to shop for a basic calculator? The native Maps app is a work in progress with many roads or local features not labeled correctly. If you want to hook this device to a camera you need to purchase a special adapter but check the reviews for the adapter as many users are reporting it no longer works after the latest OS update. There's no easy way to manage your cookies in safari. In advanced setting you can either delete all cookie data or none.  It has a very nice display however I refuse to adopt Apple marketing speak and call it \"retina\" display. Don't bother thinking you'll be able to send anything to your printer unless of course you have a specific \"air\" printer that will work with the Apple iOS. I could go on but hopefully you get the point that this device has both strong and weak points.", "Date": "June 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Multipurpose Tablet", "Author": "Student", "ReviewID": "R2NVMYCXD1WBB6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This product is amazing. It's not perfect, but considering that I'll have it for at least 2 years and I've used it every day so far, I certainly get my $.40 worth each day! It's very sturdy and I know it will hold up well, as my other Apple products have. I have friends who still use their original iPads (they work just fine, but many applications don't run on the operating system). I have a Kindle (an old version), and still love my Kindle as a reader. It's the only way I can read in the sunlight and it's SO lightweight. Eventually, I'll upgrade to a new Kindle reader, but I see them as having different purposes. The iPad is a mini computer, and the non-Fire Kindle is the equivalent of carrying around a book (or a thousand).iPad 3 vs. iPad 4:I purchased the version right before this one--the iPad 3--several weeks before the announcement of this version. I called Apple a few days after the announcement, and they immediately set me up with a way to return the iPad 3 to repurchase the newest version. I realize that some people were angry about the announcement, but there has to be a cut off date for new technology at some point, and I thought that Apple treated me as well or better than I've seen from any other technology company.Yes, both the iPad 3 and 4 have very crisp, clear screens (which are stunning for video quality compared to my Macbook from 2010). However, the increased speed of the iPad 4 makes the video quality seem clearer. It's difficult to explain, but movies definitely got a bit crisper. Also, the increased speed really is incredible when opening apps and running a lot at once. I'd say the time it takes to open large applications is cut in half. But, I was so impressed with the iPad 3 when it came, and if I hadn't been able to exchange it, I would still give it a 5-star review--it's definitely not \"obsolete.\"Finally, what makes the iPad special? First, no one *needs* one. But now that I have one, it's sure useful and I wouldn't want to go back to life before I got one. Here's why:* I sit at school or at work in front of a computer all day. I am always typing or reading on the screen. Coming come to something different is nice--it's refreshing. I'd rather watch a tv show on a 10\" iPad than any other non-TV device (laptop, tablet, phone, etc.). The picture quality is great for movies and browsing, and the 10\" screen is big enough to share if a friend and I want to watch something together. A 7\" isn't enough for that or big enough to basically serve as a TV replacement.* It is functional enough to REPLACE a computer. Don't get me wrong, I still need my computer for editing files, serious typing, spreadsheets, etc. But right after I got the ipad, I went on a 10-day trip. No computer, no problem. I could take care of all of my emails from work and school, keep in touch, keep up with my finances, etc. It was anything I'd need for a non-work trip. Web browsing works just as well as a laptop for 95% of sites, and there's an app for many that even improves the browsing experience.* Given the first two points, I think owning an iPad will greatly extend the life of my laptop. I probably use my laptop 50% less now that I have an iPad, so I'll probably get an extra year of life out of my laptop as a result. That, in itself, makes the purchase of an iPad worth it in my eyes.* Integration with other Mac devices. This doesn't apply to everyone, but if you're a Mac user for a laptop or an iPhone, I'd highly recommend the iPad over alternatives, even if it's more expensive. If you're hooked on Windows products or Google products, I'd consider those devices.* The number of apps. I know that apps are everywhere these days, but, it seems at least, that there are still the most applications for Apple devices. The difference is especially noticeable in non-retail applications. For example, I've tried dozens of \"to do\" and organizer apps, and my favorite, Errands, is only available on iOS. Another of my favorites, Fotopedia Heritage (a gorgeous display of UNESCO World Heritage photography), is only on iPad. So far (and this may change), a lot of companies also choose to release new iOS versions of applications first. This edge will decrease with time, but for now it is still a significant \"plus\" for an iPad over other tablets for those who are into applications. Also, I can run most iPhone apps on the iPad, and there's an easy way to tell the difference (e.g. you can search just for iPad apps or for iPhone/iPad/iPod apps). Not sure if you can do this on other tablets, but I've found it useful (e.g. my bank only has an iphone app, but I can still run it on my iPad). Finally, though, just to be clear, this is NOT just a device for running applications. I could do almost everything I choose to do through applications just by using a web browser.* The number of accessories. Many won't care about this, but some will. If you like to have cases to protect your electronics, the sheer number for iPad is a draw (not a huge one, but the sprinkles on the cake). Everything's out there, from cheap plastic covers to the smart cover (the one that folds as a stand) to professional-looking leather folios to designer soft zip cases. It can be a fashion statement, but it's more likely just a way to make sure to keep your device safe.* Finally, and this may be petty, but it's the most professional device. In the field I know (law), partners at law firms and federal judges use iPads, not other devices to read briefs, send emails, etc. I've never seen anyone doing work on a Kindle device and I've never even seen another tablet in a professional setting. Part of this may be that it's a well-established product, and part may be that the 10-inch screen is nice for reading, even if it's bulkier. Being able to feel comfortable that you can carry your device in a professional environment may matter for some, and the iPad definitely delivers above other devices there.", "Date": "December 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "As good as advertised", "Author": "stu", "ReviewID": "RMGBPKEZ1NMXG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Grandma bought this for our Daughter on her Birthday.

Here I am going to talk about what 'new' features you see in the IPad 4 (also called the 'new' IPad).First off.. they don't make the IPad 3 anymore.. when this was created it was immediately a replacement for the IPad 3.  There wasn't a lot of fanfare as this wasn't a huge upgrade over the 3 and was just released with the new IPad Mini.The two main features (for those in the US):- Retina display.. I never thought the display was bad, but this is an improvement.  Compared next to the original IPad 3 there is a difference, albeit not overly noticeable unless you get an app that was made for the retina display (not many out there yet as the product isn't even 30 days old yet).  The glare issue is still there.  If you're using this outside it's basically like looking in the mirror if the sun is at a bad angle. Nothing changed on that front.- Faster speed. Same as above I never thought it was an issue but when using some speed tests it is faster and you'll notice, especially when multitasking, the apps run smoother with less 'hitches'.Also:- Like the IPad Mini and the new phone it has the 8-pin adapter and not the 'old' 30 pin insert.Everything else.. the exact same as the former IPad 3. Battery life is great and while I'm not a 'heavy' user of the IPad (mainly used for web surfing, basic apps, etc..) it fits all of my needs.  Overall, if you have the IPad 3 should you upgrade?  I don't see a major reason unless you're the type that HAS to have the latest and greatest.  I just happened to finally be in the market for one (after years of indifference) and with my roommate having the IPad 3 it was an easy comparison.", "Date": "November 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "My first iPad", "Author": "W.

Basically from day 1 they loaded up the iPad with apps of all sort, so much so that there was not enough space to get updates.  They have periodically come to me to complain about lack of wifi connectivity, I usually restarted the device and most of the time it would connect (for a time at least).  I assumed this was some sort of a software issue that would be corrected when I upgraded.  So I finally wiped off the iPad and upgraded and have only had a greyed out  wifi on switch.  We live in the great midwest nowhere close to an apple store.  I finally made a trip to Des Moines IA to take to the apple store there for service.  It is a wifi ant problem (a known issue) and the fix involved $300 to upgrade.  It is certainly my fault for not believing my kids or investigating the issue sooner.  The apple store is so well advertised as the place to go to get apple products fixed I wrongly assumed this was my only option.If this were any other sort of problem (bluetooth issue, cracked screen etc) I would expect that to be a reasonable option for an out of warranty issue - but with a known problem?

I think that they use proprietary features and lock out very helpful items (like expansion cards and user-changeable batteries).  In fact, the biggest reason that Apple Fanboys tout their products is that they are user-friendly - and I find that ridiculous - iTunes is one of the WORST software interfaces I've ever seen - it's incredibly difficult to get it to do what you want.  And I've never been a fan of the iDevices either.Until today.  My incredibly generous girlfriend got me an iPad for my Birthday, and I am truly blown away by its ease of use (for the most part - some settings are really buried, or in non-intuitive locations), its tight form factor, its unbelievable battery life, and it's unparalleled apps and games.After only a few weeks, I find that it is my go to device for checking email, social media, gaming, and gathering information.  Even writing documents is easy because of Siri and it's impressive voice recognition.I still wish it had an SD card or expansion slot, but I really can't complain too much.

I've owned each of the iPads (1, 2, 3, & mini) and just received this one.  It is very obviously faster than iPad 3!  I cannot believe the number of \"professional\" reviewers on tech sites stating that they didn't really notice any difference.I was enraptured when I first obtained iPad 3, and felt at the time that the retina display ticked off my last \"needs\" box as far as tablet computing.  But as I lived with it, it became annoying waiting on its A5X to scroll in a dense webpage ----- daily so.  And the internet browsing experience is the real reason to consider upgrading to the 4 from the 3; it really is that much better.  To use one of my favorite iDevice information websites as an example, go to www.imore.com on the iPad 3, and observe the staccato, stop-and-go browsing experience as you navigate down the page.  Now, do the same on the iPad 4; it's smooth as silk.I'll still be looking for the retina iPad mini when it arrives (looks like 2014 at this rate), but other than the slight heaviness of this iPad 4, I'm completely satisfied.  Noting the never-ending march to smaller-thinner-and-lighter-yet-longer-battery-life, it's difficult to see what Apple can do to improve upon this one.", "Date": "June 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "banda", "ReviewID": "ROY058C5D9DP8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this tablet!

I'm very happy with the upgrades.  Like with my old iPad I'm basically using it to surf the net, watch streaming videos/podcasts, and read books.  I don't take pictures with it or store music.  I'm also not a gamer - so I can't comment that much on the retina display - but I will say the colors are brighter and I find it easier to read books.  The big difference that I notice is in the processor.  Even with my crappy internet connection I notice a huge improvement in the speed with opening apps and streaming videos.  Battery life is longer than the iPad 2. However, because the battery is bigger on this device it takes a lot longer to charge.  I like to kill the batteries on all my electronic devices before I charge them and from a dead battery to 100% charge on this iPad it took over 8 hours to fully charge.  I wasn't using it when it was charging.  In fact, I read on a couple of review sites that this iPad will continue to charge up to 2 hours after it says it's fully charged.  My advice is to allow yourself extra time and charge it overnight if you can.All in all I'm very happy with it.  Since I carry it with me everywhere I bought the OtterBox Defender Series Case with Screen Protector and Stand for the New iPad (4th Generation), iPad 2 and 3 - Pink Alpenglow for extra protection.

I have a 2007 desktop that runs Windows (which I recently ditched for Linux Mint) and it has always been my workhorse. I do a lot of graphic design work, school essays, and quite a bit of writing as a hobby. Last year I purchased a Samsung Galaxy Tab 7 inch and still like it for the most part, but even I--a \"no knowledge with a mac\" person--must admit the tab and other devices like it don't come anywhere close to the complete experience with the ipad. My main reason for not buy this has been because I had never really gotten my hands on one up close. Then one day my son walked in with one, and I was blown away by the ease of use combined with applications that work so naturally. I spent hours upon days tweaking the galaxy tab and fighting notifications. None of that with this device. It's smooth, durable, and brilliant. I also purchased a Smart Cover which works just fine but I might end up getting one of the clamshell style cases for use as a laptop when I'm out and about. As I type this, the iWork suite is updating in the background and the lightning cable is connected without any slowdown at all. Couldn't get that much out of the android tablet. I am also using the Anker bluetooth keyboard and it works perfectly.

WiFi connection is never a problem, the OS is super fast, the retina display is awesome, the feel of the tablet is nice, the sound is okay, the camera takes high quality pics/vids, the battery life is long, and I love all of the apps that are available. Also, I'm in the healthcare profession and often need to reference medical information quickly, so having this tablet provides me with the ability to get information in real time (using medical apps) and/or record notes all while at the patient's side.

I decided to upgrade, but did not see any great advantage to getting and IPad Air for the extra bump in money.  We live very rural with no internet access, only the 3G on the iPad. I thought the slow download on the 2 was because of our setting - videos were out, pictures took a long time - so when we got the iPad 4, I was pleasantly surprised!  We can watch videos, download stories and generally just peruse the internet while not putting it down and doing something else while it loads!  The picture is marvelous, clear and sharp!  I did not think that would be so important but does make for good reading.

After opening the box and setting my AppleID, I downloaded a few new applications,just to see how everything works. However, I was greatly surprised by noting that none of these applications can beremoved in the usual way (by pressing the icon, waiting for an \"x\" to appear, etc.). I contacted Apple support; they explainedme how to remove these applications with the help of iTunes on PC. That was OK, but certainly I didn't expect that removingan application should be so complicated. Although the Ipad was declared as being new, I had the impression that somebody used it before and messed the iOS. Being rather disappointed, I start playing with the device for a few days. Not knowing what else to do, I decided to reset the iOS (iOS6 to iOS7). Surprisingly, that was a step that resolved all the problems! The Ipad started working normally, and I don't expect to have similar problems in the future. Nevertheless, such an incorrect behavior of the iOS at the very beginning was frustrating for a device declared as new.

I found myself in a job where I am on very remote locations with quite a bit of downtime and finally decided that I could use one.I have been absolutely thrilled with this device. It is extremely stable, even with the new iOS 7 operating system. I am very happy that I chose the Retina model, because the screen is basically perfect. For everything from web browsing to watching Netflix, the quality of video and images is second to none.App performance on the iPad Retina is superb, and many of the iPad specific apps are simply mind-blowing, particularly some of the art apps like Sketchbook Pro and Procreate. I recently acquired an Adonit Jot 4, which is a pressure sensitive stylus that connects via Bluetooth, and it works like something out of the future. Just crazy good. For forum participation, writing Amazon reviews, etc., I prefer my laptop simply because I don't like typing on a touchscreen, but that's just my personal preference. I can get around on the touchscreen and if I really wanted a physical keyboard, there are several available. But that's not really what the iPad is all about. It's not there to replace your computer; it's a different type of device that excels at browsing and media consumption and is portable in a way that no laptop is.Though it takes a bit longer than I would like to take a full charge, the battery life is excellent, and I rarely find myself needing to charge when I am out and about.As a media consumption / web browsing device, the iPad Retina is ideal. The screen is so amazing that it is generally preferable to me over a larger computer or laptop screen for these purposes. I take a star off of my rating because USB connectivity would be REALLY helpful for those who would like to watch movies that they have stored on an external drive. There really is no reason that the iPad shouldn't have USB.I love my iPad, and it is so usable in this current configuration that I don't see myself having to replace it with the latest and greatest for many years.", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "very cool", "Author": "TSKPP", "ReviewID": "R1AUZXO9SSK1RI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My first ipad!

When I first heard about the Retina display, I was sort of shocked by it and a bit doubtful. I thought there was no way that they can make the display any better... but I was wrong, it looks better than any still photo! It looks more real, realer. It is absolutely amazing. I got the 16GB Wifi only and have not had a problem with it once. I did get this one since I was not interested in the iPad Air that they had coming out, and I already had a 7 inch Kindle, so I was not interested in the iPad mini that was already on sale.I do not regret this purchase at all, everything on it works wonderfully, I got a Fintie case for it that rotates which is wonderful, and I must say that this iPad is the only thing in the world that is as close to perfect as anything or anyone can get. Pictures look wonderful, games look fantastic, and The Cloud works very well on this device. There is no set up time, just enter your email and password (or make an account) and that is it you are ready to use/share on The Cloud.I have to say now after experiencing Apple and their products, I now will be purchasing all their products (the products that I need) so they can all work together and accommodate one another. Right now I have an iMac and iPad and they work wonderfully together. Syncing my PC takes a bit more time, but it does indeed work. Although it is not as quick or seamless as my Apple products syncing with each other, but of course they are using the same iOS, etc. so that is understandable.This device is a masterpiece, best little computer there is, and is a absolute pleasure to have.5 stars all the way!!

I used it for about 2 weeks.  I found it not as intuitive and the learning curve, while not bad, was a bit more cumbersome to learn to use.  Also it was one more operating system I would have to understand and use. I have an iphone 5, which replace my 4.  The iphone is easy to use, all kinds of apps (though I dont use many, its nice to know they are available).  I have handle the ipad before from relatives etc and they seemed nice and all, but not much different  from the iphone and wondered why the fuss.  At the time, I just couldnt see spending the bigger bucks for the iPad.  I found out differently.  While the Kindle does everything it says it does,  I returned it and ordered this ipad.  I feel now that it is definitely worth the extra.  It has the same sharp image with the retina display as the kindle and I would say even better.  Since I travel a lot and have satelite for TV at home, I use a vulkano (like sling box) to view my DVR recordings and live tv stations from home.  The Kindle did an OK job, but the iPad is superior with that task.  the app for kindle worked, had to pay extra for it and the operating system handled it OK but every 30 to 40 minutes it would drop the connection.  The ipad app was free and rock solid, so far.  I had used the iphone for several years, and using the iPad is as comfortable with familiar icons and function.  It has a little larger screen, ease of use, more apps, and accessories than kindle which made me spring for the extra dollars.

But even though the Amazon Market Place's packaging for shipment was as good as required for shipping and delivering this type of merchandise, and that the Apple iPad factory box was undamaged, both wrappings intact and unopened, the iPad screen came with a noticeable two centimeter hairline scratch on top center, right below the camera lens. The scratch was visible through the factory envelope-like cellophane wrapping around the iPad itself. That type of scratch, could not had happened at the seller's warehouses, nor during transportation/delivery because it requires direct contact with the screen to produce it and as I explained the delivery package and product box where undamaged and unopened, so responsibility lies with manufacturing facility during or before final boxing of the iPad, which says a little of quality assurance and control in this case. That is, I do not blame Amazon nor the seller for the problem in this particular case (first time ever).That aside, the new iPad is working nicely and has a great retina display (colors, graphics, resolution...) and great speed. But I still will not give it the fourth and fifth stars, because contrary to what I'm used, and expect, to get from Apple products, this one didn't have that mint condition look that I expected from and Apple's new item. Instead of going trough the process of returning with all the time delay and implications (customs in my country for once)I installed a anti-glare/mate screen protector to \"hide\" the scratch, which somehow defeats the purpose of the great retina displayIMPORTANT UPDATE: IOS 7 have a feature that cannot be turned of, which verifies that the Lightning connector is certified by Apple, and as soon as I update to IOS 7, and connected my iPad to be charged with the Lightning connector that came with the iPad in the original, brand new, sealed and unopened factory box I got a pop up display that stated that my iPad connector isn't certified and my not function properly with my iPad. I reported this to apple via chat support and the agent told me, after running an online diagnostic, that my device and connectors were new and that it was a glitch in the IOS 7 verifying routine that would be fixed on a next release (update of IOS 7), so I dismissed (every time) the message and charged my iPad without problems. But that was until today, after connecting the new iPad with the supposedly original Apple lightning connector and receiving the  warning message, the iPad stop charging after reaching 27% charge. Beware, either don't buy this model or wait until Apple issues some kind of correction or update removing that verifying routine from IOS 7. Right now for me, living outside the US this is a disaster, returning the device, for me is not an option. So I will have to take my iPad to a Venezuelan authorized service center, testing and probably buying a new \"original\" lightning connector, cause if I buy the Apple care plan in the US It won't be applicable in my country.", "Date": "August 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "This bad boy rocks!!!!", "Author": "SB", "ReviewID": "RYZ0PSEQ2M0H1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Everything good about this device which you may have heard by now is total truth.

My response; okay let me go to my money tree and pick some bills out, goodbye!  If you go to an electronics store, make sure to have at least $200 laying around.

For watching TV or movies its great and the better picture of the I-Pad 4 is more suitable than the 3 if you're upgrading or initial buy.  Another plus is it connects to the 5GHz band of my dual band router and rarely has a buffer problem.Apples constant upgrades every few months is a turn off to me and this will be a one time buy - same reason I bought two 3GS phones, runs the new software at a half the price of a new phone every few months.

The screen is a bit yellow, and its overall performance is on a par with HTC One. iPad 4's hardware technically is faster, but no any difference is found on system speed so far. Therefore, iPad has no advantage over HTC One, except the much bigger screen.On the other hand, Android is of course MUCH freer and easier to use. The iOS and iTunes always takes me hours to do something that can just be done in three minutes on Android.

Our iPads are useless and Apple does not have any idea how to make them not useless....so now we have 3 $800 Kindles readers with apple logos on them that aren't as user friendly as the actual Kindles.

LOL!What wasn't really funny is the fact that I purchased the Newest, 4rth Generation IPad, the 64GBS Version, White, Standard-sized, with the Retina Display screen, and Siri onboard; and I guess, ready to \"speak\", but I won't ever know now, as I am having to return it, and fortunately for me, through a 2nd Party Buyer. Why is THAT a \"Plus\", in my favor? Because another large, corporate entity, that DOES stand behind their customers, will be behind me on the return of this Defective IPad, and literally, right out of the box! The Second Party ALSO, has deemed it \"defective\", formally, which will help.In short, I charged this brand new, IPad, for 12 hours straight, and it only went to 83% battery charge. after 14 hours of continuous chsrging, from TWO different charging stations, ( I also have an Ipod Touch, but that's for later. ) it only reached 95% charge, if NEVER reached a Full Charge, and this is on it's first one! No \"lighting bolts\" in battery, for me to see! I have since packed it up, and am awaiting the \"call-tag ALREADY marked as \"defective\" from the Secondary Partner with Apple, and then I am sending it back ASAP! whether the trouble is the battery, or something technically more involved, I am NOT going to be the one left hanging with it THIS time!Three months ago, I bought my first Apple Product ever, and it was the IPod Touch, also in White, and also the 64GBS-version. It also was my first mp3 player, but I waited more than 3 years to finally decide to get it, as I have had problems with JUST how expensive Apple Products are, but if they work well, after all, \"they\" are the industry standard for the best there is. PLUS, they DO have their own network, IOS, which was very important to me, as well, At any rate, I got the IPod Touch, and it took 3 times, AND a Senior Technician, to get me on-line with the thing, and I told him THEN, that it shouldn't have been that difficult to get it to sync with my in-home wifi. It hadn't been with my other devices, including my workhorse computer. They are supposed to be such \"user-friendly\", people, with a Customer Service Center, and assistants, that are purported to be the best in the world. That is what I have been told, what is advertised the world over, and I have had some friends who have gotten Apple Products themselves, down through the years, and they have sworn by them, mostly. I FINALLY decided to make the leap, and get the Touch. It gave me NOTHING but problems, also right out of the box, and they just started with the problems with the initial set up. There were several others, and within the first two months of owning it, it went into Repair 4 times in turnaround shipping, they had it in their possession MORE than I did! On the fifth trouble call, and me madder than a wet hornet, I FINALLY got myself a Senior Advisor there, who took stock of the several complaints ALREADY lodged, and documented, mind you, and got me a Replacement IPod Touch, and........ It worked like a charm, also right out of the box, and it still is! The thing was, you see, it wasn't defective in the First Place! It has been working just fine, since I was issued it, and thank heaven's for that Senior Tech, as I am NOT sure that Apple Care wouldn't have left me hanging in mid-air, with the original IPod Touch, and I really think that they would have. I have come around a bit since THAT experience about not only Apple's Customer Service, but also concerning Apple's Quality Control Standards! What the heck is up, with that?After that fiasco, WHY was I willing to buy the New IPad? Because it was supposed to be a \"second computer/backup\" which it technically can be, btw, businessman even use them. It also is very portable, and also supposedly, easy to work with. Of course, I won't ever know that now, as I am having to return THIS one due to defectiveness right out of the box. It certainly HAS had an effect on me, I am waiting until AFTER the first of the year, either in January, or even February, before I make another move about getting something for my computing needs, and choices. I WON'T go through THIS mess again, I can tell you that! Besides, what were the odds that the same type of thing would happen to the same person, with TWO DIFFERENT APPLE PRODUCTS? I thought astronomical, that's WHY I took the chance on the purchase of the IPad.Which only goes to show, there are \"Bad Apples's that DO Fall From the Apple Tree\", and sometimes, lightning DOES strike in the same place!
