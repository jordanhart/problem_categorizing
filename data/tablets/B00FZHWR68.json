There are now five tablets floating around my house, so I have a lot to compare it to, including a Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" tablet. Obviously, the specs will not compare for that, but compared to my other generic tablets, it comes out ahead.SURFING THE WEBThere's a little lag loading pages, but it's not too bad. The only real problem I had was YouTube (see below).STREAMING AUDIO AND VIDEOI loaded Songza onto this device. The app takes a little time to load, but the music streams with no problems. I found the sound loud and clean enough for personal listening. For a fuller sound, consider adding a Bluetooth speaker.YouTube took forever to load. The tablet fell asleep, so I gave up. YouTube videos embedded on other sites stream well.BLUETOOTH AND WI-FIBluetooth is very good. I paired it with my headphones and the range is excellent. I can listen to music a whole floor and some rooms away. Not all tablets come with Bluetooth. I'm happy this one does.Wi-Fi signal is a little weaker than what I can get with the dongle on my computer tower, but it works. It connects much faster than the Wi-Fi on my other Android tablet.CAMERAThe rear-facing camera is superior to the one on the Pyle Astro 9-inch tablet. There are no shadows cast on the lens from the case, and the image is clear.The front-facing camera does not appear to have as high a resolution as the rear-facing camera, but it works well enough for me. Action scenes are a little more pixellated. Close up shots are a little blurry. These are general purpose cameras. If you need the finest quality, you may be disappointed, but I like the cameras. They are better than the cameras on my other generic Android tablets.GENERAL OPERATIONTouch sensitivity and responsiveness is very good, but the screen is not as slick as other more expensive tablets. Also, there is a slot for a micro SD card, but I did not use it.My kids love this tablet because it plays Minecraft without glitches. One of the other tablets always stalls and shuts off, but this one works just fine. All the apps I loaded onto the Pyle Astro work just fine.FINAL THOUGHTSThe Pyle Astro is an inexpensive alternative to the higher end tablets. I would recommend it for children, as an introductory tablet for adults, and for light users.This product was provided for review by the Max Borges Agency._______________________UPDATE 1/5/14:  I would like to add that I did not initially use a micro SD card, but I did try to mount one and it doesn't work.  This hasn't affected my enjoyment of the tablet, because I really don't ever use a micro SD card.  If you need to use one, this tablet may not be for you.", "Date": "November 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Spend a few more dollars!", "Author": "Madelyn J  Bonham", "ReviewID": "RZ9CNN9X09T56", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this for my granddaughter for Christmas and it worked slow, but ok for 1 week. It froze on the Android loading logo, and would go no further. I notified Pyle tech support, who said to return it to the seller.  They were great. I returned it and they sent me a new replacement in 5 days. I opened the new one, charged it, turned it on, touched the unlock. Unreal! The touch screen did not respond. I reread the user's manual, restarted it, reset it and still, no response. I called Pyle tech support again and they told me to tape a note on it ( so none else received it as a replacement), and to return it  once again. They came through with flying colors on my 2nd return. This time I chose a full refund, and I am looking for a different tablet.

I dont return stuff either. This tablet is making me do both.I took a chance despite the mediocre reviews and decided to go ahead and buy the tablet, understanding that there'd be shortcomings, since its as economical as it is. But this tablet can't even do the basics.Twice it froze even turning on. It couldn't open facebook, or youtube by the apps. It's just too low in terms of specs, just cant handle even basic app work. So verdict: look elsewhere, buy something else. Chip in a few extra bucks and get something slightly more capable of conducting tasks you'd hope a tablet would be able to do.
