So I went to their competitor when it was time for a tablet. Galaxy 2 10.0 beats the sock off of the ipad. I have also canned my ipod touch in favor of the Galaxy 3.6 player, it allows you to use you own music without the annoying apple store. The only problem I have with the Galaxy player is that I can't find an armband made for the device, So long apple and good riddance.", "Date": "June 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice delivery before estimated...

Loving my new tab.I've used already whit the SIM of one of my local carrier and it works perfectly whit the network getting H+ signal most of the time and when available.After a long firmware update I became even happier whit the tablet.

I have not put in my Sim card yet, so I can not comment about the data service. I've been using the wi-fi and it's very fast. I had to get an archived version of abobe flash to view videos(like from facebook), no big deal since I had to do the same for my wife's Note 10.1 also! The only thing that irks me is that it runs on Ice Cream Sandwich, not Jellybean! I know that Samsung is supposed to update this as they have done to other Tabs, & hopefully I won't have to wait too long! Different builds have already been updated. I also installed Skype, which works also. So far, so good. Better than the Ipad in my opinion and for less. Of course I got the unlocked version so I can use it with ATT, so it doesn't have a warranty, but it's a quality product.", "Date": "May 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excelent", "Author": "Bruno Fiuza Alencar Araripe", "ReviewID": "R111AUGNZ0VRMN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's an excelent tablet.
