Regular slide in flip cases do work fine. Just make sure it's not a Snap fit type case.Purchased this back in 11/2013 and have it on the 2gb plan with Sprint for $15 per month!This thing is fast, works great and really does do everything you could want a tablet to do.I've tried more expensive tablets that didn't work as fast. Not to mention the LTE lets me use the table just about anywhere.GPS works great and always dead on.Was also great as I was able to play Hulu and Netflix with it was sitting in the holder I bought for it (see my reviews) attached to my windshield going down the road.", "Date": "March 24, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00HLR57H6"}}
