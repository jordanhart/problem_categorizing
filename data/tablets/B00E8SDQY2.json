{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Bought four of these for Christmas 2013", "Author": "Kristy Hodge", "ReviewID": "RDOK5QKYYXFKO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We bought four of these from Target for our kids for Christmas so we have had them for 2 weeks. Kids ages are 15, 12, 10, and 7. I myself own an iPod Touch 4.What I like about the Kurio Touch 4s are the parental controls. I can limit the amount of time each day (eg 60 min). I can also limit the hours (eg 3pm-8pm). When it gets close to their time limit, they get a warning. When their time is up, they are locked out. However, they can still listen to music even if their time is up (love this!). Also, if I want to override their time for a snow day, I can easily do that and they can have more play time.We don't buy apps from the Kurio App Store. We only get free apps from the Amazon App Store. I have restricted my 7 and 10 year olds so that only I can download apps for them by logging into the parental account. The 15 and 12 year olds can download their own.My daughter bought a micro SD card and loaded music on it using our home PC. She put the SD card in the Kurio Touch and has listened to many hours of music with no trouble.There are a few quirks with the Kurio Touch 4s, (restricted from searching for harmless words when using the Genius Filtering System internet profile) but overall, we couldn't be more pleased. I like my iPod Touch, but for the price and added bonus of good parental controls, the Kurio Touch 4s is a quality product and I highly recommend it.I will try to remember to come back and update at 3 months. :)UPDATE: 01/18/2014 - Today the kids got an update on their Kurio Touch 4S.  Google Play has been added!  They now have access to Gmail, Play, Maps, etc.  Good news for all of you that were discouraged by the limitation of apps!UPDATE: 03/31/2014 - All 4 Kurio Touch 4S devices are still going strong! It seems that the kids get all of their apps from Google Play instead of Amazon App Store since Google Play was made available. The boys play Clash of Clans daily. Every once in a while a device will freeze and we have to do a reset by holding the volume up button and the power button until it powers off. That seems to resolve any issues.Two complaints: #1 - The charging port on the device and the charging cord have to be connected \"just so\" in order to charge the device. Sometimes they don't get connected just right and the device won't charge. #2 - My daughter can't get the free Instagram app. The Instafire app is available, which is an instagram client designed for the KindleFire. The only downside? Cost is $2.99 through Amazon App Store. We just can't bring ourselves to spend any money. :)Overall, we are still very pleased with these devices and they are well worth the price we paid in December 2013 ($99 each).  They are primarily used in our house to play games, access Facebook and listen to music.  There are many eReader apps available, so you could use this device to read as well.  We also own Kindles and use those for reading.  There isn't any web browsing done on our devices.  We restrict that to computers.  Great device at a reasonable price for all ages.UPDATE 05/30/2014: My 15 year old daughter dropped her Kurio, which DID NOT have the rubber case on it.  She dropped it on concrete and the screen cracked very badly, rendering the device useless.  This is not a flaw in the product.  The boys keep their rubber cases on and have dropped the Kurio 4s countless times.  Lesson:  Keep the rubber case on these!My 7 year old son's Kurio 4s can no longer be charged.  :(  One of the prongs on the charging port inside the Kurio got bent/damaged and it will no longer connect completely to the cord.  This IS a flaw in the product, in my opinion.  My iPod Touch 4 has been charged countless times in 2 years with no problems in the charging port.  The Kurio 4s charging port is definitely inferior to Apple's product.Out of 4 devices purchased for Christmas 2013, 2 are still working (the ones that belong to my 12 year old and 10 year old boys) great after 6 months.  The good news?  The Kurio 4s is about $61 on Amazon if we want to replace them.", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Kurio - great tablet that has encouraged our son to read more!", "Author": "BC_TX", "ReviewID": "R1D2CW97CYYJ7K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Kurio was a gift from my parents to our 10 year old son - who thinks they are the coolest people in the planet! He absolutely loves it - and so do we. From our point of view, we love the fact that we can control what content he sees, when he sees it and for how long (that is a GREAT feature!). The initial set up was pretty straight forward (once connected to WiFi - things just `flow'), it took about 10 minutes for my husband (he is an engineer) to get the tablet up and running for him. We did go back at it later and tweak some of the configuration to make sure we had all our bases covered in terms of what he has access to. Again - this secondary set up was pretty straight forward. Once we gave him to him - it took him a little while to figure out the controls/hand gestures - and well - he has been loving it since. The preloaded apps/games have kept him entertained from the beginning, and then we looked for new ones (we wanted a few educational games on there). He has enjoyed those as well, and now he is able to search and download what he wants (within the limits we stipulated). We purchased an external memory card - and have uploaded a couple of his favorite movies and songs. He has taken to photograph the world around him and show us what things look like from his perspective (which is fun).  Something that caught us by surprise (and we are very thankful for) is that he loves reading books in his tablet. This is an unexpected bonus, and we will continue to encourage him to read more. We have looked at the non-child interface (we followed the instructions to activate the full Android interface - and we can see that it is useful for adults too. Basically it seems to operate in the same way as a normal Android tablet. That is a great option too!) The tablet itself seems to be well constructed, and we have spoken to him about taking care of it (don't drop it, clean your hands before use, etc.) so that it lasts long. We were a little bit disappointed that we could not find the Google Play store on it, but this was easily remedied by installing the Amazon app store instead (Little Piano is a huge hit!). So really - this is a minor point. Our son loves his Kurio and we are very happy with the level of control that we have over what content he can access. We cannot really ask for more!", "Date": "July 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "disappointing", "Author": "edequimm", "ReviewID": "R1E6G6SNUGOBHO", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "We looked long and hard at tablets that we could use as a family - narrowing it down to the Kindle Fire and Kurio 7, both $199. Both have pros and cons for what we wanted - an educational tool for our young children, something to keep them entertained on trips as well as some functionality for us. We finally chose the Kurio 7 - the deciding factors being it has a camera and 4.0 OS. However, neither of these features make up for the fact that it does not give access to the full android market which has a much larger selection of apps, especially free apps. Kurio have their own market but it has very limited offerings (particularly in free apps for kids - when searching it said no free educational apps for kids and no free ebooks for young children!) Why would I pay for apps via Kurio market when I know I can get similar/better ones for free and a much greater range of paid ones elsewhere? I understand this is a tablet for kids and there are restrictions on the content they should have access to. But why not allow full access to android market in the parental section? Not having access to the apps I want drastically limits the functionality of this tablet for what we want. This may not be an issue for others buyers of this product but for us it is a deal-breaker and we will be returning this for the Kindle Fire.Since writing the review above a couple of days ago, I have had a chance to play with the Kurio tablet more. The camera/video recorder should not be a deciding factor in buying this tablet (which is was for us) as the quality is very poor (but in fairness it probably has similar megapixels to other cameras on tablets.) Also, some of the 'kid friendly' apps/games available on the curated Kurio market are not what I'd call (young) kid friendly (for example, a game where you stop zombies from eating farm animals and another game with explicit graphics on having your choice of saw 'cut' your fingers.) In addition, some inappropriate ads pop up \"get a free gun\", \"3 babes want to connect with you\" on some of the free games we downloaded which was surprising as the content is curated to be family appropriate and is the reason Kurio does not give access to the full android market. Perhaps these pop-up ads are outside of Kurio's control or maybe slipped under their radar? Again, these points may not be an issue for all parents, especially those with older children (ours are 4-5 yrs), but are further reasons why this is not the right tablet for us.

I explained I just wanted to return it at this point since I had an issue right out of the box and they were unable to help.  She was rude and I asked for a supervisor who refused to take the item back until I had 6 emails from them attempting to fix the issue and informed me I would have to pay to ship back and would not get a refund on tax or shipping and could take up to 12 weeks to get a refund and then she HUNG UP ON ME!  At a loss I emailed for help and the first email I got after explainingy problem started out \" obviously you are incorrectly...\" I emailed back and got the same form letter back!  I did get it connected thanks to MY Internet provider and its not all its made out to be very confusing for a child but am keeping since I would only get about half my money back after 3 months!

I bought it in November and tried to get it set up before Christmas so ti would be ready to go. No Google Play store was a huge drawback for us. But there is suppose to be the Kurio Store to get new apps from and Amazon App Store. Neither of them work. Upon contacting Kurio, they say the Third Party (SlideMe) is the app provider and they are having problems. They had NO answer as to why the amazon app store never works either. I didn't find all this out til Christmas day when nothing would work as it was suppose to. I cannot return it to Amazon since it wasn't DEAD ON ARRIVAL so I am left with my only recourse being dealing with Kurio. I am not a happy camper.

I have to say I am less than impressed with them! Although they have stood up to my 2 year olds throwing them around (very sturdy and no cracked screens yet, I really wished we had picked another system for our boys. So far they've lasted 4 months and still going although I'm tempted to throw them out the window at times. Save your $150 and buy something else.The good:*Sturdy and come with a rubber case to protect them from being thrown around.* A good selection of games to download for free. I chose these over a traditional gaming + cartridge system because the games get so expensive. Lots of free apps/games here to download (also one's you can buy too) My kids love the free angry birds apps!The bad:*BATTERY LIFE is tiny. I think we've rarely gone more than an hour or 90 minutes without the device going dead. Really inconvenient when you're about to take them on a road trip into town and you forgot to charge the battery for one of the. My boys argue over the one that still has battery left in it....that's why we bought 2 in the first place! Grrr!*Takes forever to load to the home screen. It takes at least a full 2 minutes before it's in play mode on the home screen and to a 2 year old that is an eternity!*also is not very user friendly to set up. It kept asking me to register the device and complete the setup. This included inputting my home wi-fi password and setting parental controls, email address, etc. Until I competed the setup my kids had to keep handing them back to me to get them to the home screen so they could play the games. Very annoying.*Once I did get the devices set up, then they automatically go to the \"kids friendly\" screen while my kids started out using the alternate (non-registered) screen and they don't like the kid screen. In order to get it set up on the alternate screen I have to enter the password from the parental controls EVERY TIME my kids want to play with them. Again, very annoying!!!****The most annoying feature of all is when I attempt to enter the password for the parental controls, the device somehow enters phantom characters while I'm trying to enter the password. Totally messes up the password entry and I have to delete and start over. I've had to do this many times and this is where I wanted to throw the device out the window. I try to type something like \"2345\" and it types \"2_djfkla;j\" sometimes there's 3 characters for every 1 I actually type into the on screen keyboard.And done. Never again!

I purchased for Christmas for my 8 yr old son to use for homework, games, etc.  I gave it to him a week early because I was excited. I input ALL of our personal information only to have the system stop working on Christmas Eve; less than a week after he received it.  The bubbly screen stayed on and finally went off by itself.  We fully charged it for two days only to have the KD Interactive logo stay on for more than 8 hours; even after five attempts to hit the reset button.  The screen went blank for a second and came back on.  FINALLY went off but won't come on again.  Read the manual that directed me online where I sat for over 5 mins chatting with myself because the system kept timing me out and resetting.  No one ever acknowledged my presence.  I finally gave up and located a number for Kurio 4S model.  Called and the loop kept telling me to hold on before it finally directed me to \"leave a message.\"  They had better be glad I don't curse but I left a scathing voicemail that they are probably just laughing at because they don't care.  Who sells a product without providing a phone number for customer support.  Better yet, who BUYS a product without fully researching this?  I honestly didn't think I would need customer support and surely not within one week of buying the product.  Oh, and the number I found was only available M-F until 3pm PST; how convenient for those of us who are in different time zones and have jobs.  They ask you in the pamphlet to not return the unit to the store but to reach out to them.  What a joke.  PLEASE do yourself a favor and avoid the headache; buy a different, more reliable product and save yourself the headache.  I work hard for my money and I WILL be returning device to the store as soon as possible because I refuse to be stuck with such a product that didn't last beyond one week of use and clearly lacks proper customer support.

That's cause the hardware does this job for you. It makes surfing the net next to impossible and an incredibly frustrating experience. I kid you not it took 25 minutes to check an email with gmail. It was the same with almost any other site on the net.Playing the games worked fine but after awhile our son wanted new games and so we tried to download the app that is needed to download more games (whether free or paid) and again, after 25 minutes couldn't get it done. There's no real instructions on how to do that and none to poor customer support. So we looked online for fixes that people post on youtube and other sites and tried them to no avail. They required some advanced technical knowledge too.So here we sit with a tablet that plays Angry Birds and few other uninteresting games ... out $150 and our son has moved on.

But, i hate the fact that it does not use google play store, so you can forget about finding any games you've ever gotten there. it only comes with the \"kurio store\" on which EVERYTHING costs $ there are NO free apps. then  they offer you to add other app stores ( not google play) but they offer them at your own risk, if anything goes wrong with your tablet from using the 3rd party stores, they will not be responsible. well, thats just crap. the other stores they offer, two of which i have never even heard of, one of them though, is amazon app. they do have free apps, but still not every available app you can get on google play. you cannot get the real Youtube app, no matter which of the 4 stores you choose. only one had the netflix app, and when i got it logged in and picked a movie, only the audio was working and not the video, so i tried another movie to make sure it wasnt just that movie, but no, still no video. contacted kurio. they will NOT help you, because netflix is a 3rd party app. so they had me called netflix. i called netflix and they were glad to try and help so they sent me an email with complicated instructions that i still havent figured out, i am SERIOUSLY considering returning the damn things ( i bought two) but i dont know what kids tablet i can get that uses google play, because im told nabi2 and kindle fire also use amazon app store. im SO disapointed because my kids and myself were looking forward to these tablets being great, and its the biggest let down ever. also, my kids' favorite game is Hayday, and it is NOT available in any of the 4 stores. what a disaster.I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND TO ANYONE TO BUY THIS TABLET!!!!!!!!!!!!and if you do, i hope you have no problems with it because kurios customer service really STINKS!Bad job Kurio, bad job :(UPDATE:After owning the tablet for about 2 weeks, a system update became available, and upon installing it, Google Play store is now available, which I am glad about. Also, after the update, Netflix began to work. Im glad Kurio did resolve these issues, as they were my main two concerns.

While I wait and listen to my son ask me for his \"computer\" every other day, I have installed the Kindle Free Time app on my Kindle Fire and my son and I have been sharing it.

I also did not recieve a charger for it, as stated on the box as included. I only recieved the USB cord, which it is possible to charge it that way, but it is not at all the intended charger, and as with all electronics, charging them that way, can cause damage to your product.", "Date": "January 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "This Kurio is Horrible!!!!!!!", "Author": "Avid Customer", "ReviewID": "R2UEPOND9923K9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This was a horrible purchase!!!

I dealt with their live chat twice and found out that \"live chat\" doesn't actually do anything other than direct you to their e-mail based support.The E-mail based support didn't respond to my e-mails, and after getting back on their only other communications option...live chat...I was told that I must have done it wrong and to send it again from a different domain.To make a long story short, I took the device back.

The tablet was cute and the reviews were mixed but there were some good ones and for $149 I thought it was worth a shot. Luckily I decided to open the tablet and set it up for my son before i wrapped it and gave it to him and boy am I glad i did. First thing i noticed was it took a while to boot up. I wasnt too bothered by that because for the price i wasnt expecting it to be lightning fast. Next i went through set up. I put the wifi information in and it connected. After set up i tried to go to the app store and it said i was not connected to the internet. I set up wifi again and same thing happened. Finally i got technical support and they instructed me how to do it and keep it connected. It would have been nice for those steps to be in set up. Then i tried to download some apps and they wouldnt download. I kept getting failed messages. I tried to download the Amamzon store and got same problem. Back to technical support I went. They told me it was Amazon's problem and they couldnt help me even though apps from the KURIO store werent working either. That was the last straw and i took it back. I bought a NABI2 instead, It Is 1000 times better than the kurio and worth the extra money. The kurio was way too slow and their customer service sucked big time!
