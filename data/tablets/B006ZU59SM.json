Arrived in good condition as advertised.I bought this tablet to rep.ace my Nexus 7, I broke (lol). And I actually like it better than the nexus 7. The screen us clear, the sound is loud & crisp. Also the size of the screen, as weird as it sounds I love big screen tablets. The XOOM also has a great amount of storage memory & a slot to add a memory/SD Card! Great buy!

Wolnik", "ReviewID": "R1KWNQ7MXW0YYZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Used this tab for over a year and still love it.  It seems most is the negative reviews relate more to the secondary market sellers who I always avoid.  Only shop from amazon fulfillment, they stand behind there products.  For 2+ yr. old tech, this tab handles almost everything I throw at it including playing movies through the dock onto my HDTV.  Works great with netflix or torrents.  Battery life is still incredible and will last a weekend without charging with normal use.  On a side note, the dock is a must have bargain accessory which is discounted to under $15 and charges while you play to the HDMI output.  Final side note, this is Verizon data capable but a data Sim is not required, it works great with wifi networks including your droid's hotspot.", "Date": "November 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great product", "Author": "Msg", "ReviewID": "R36CNAE3FX4SSW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It looks very good and woks just fine and for the price i think this was a una ganga!!!
