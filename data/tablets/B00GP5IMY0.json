But at that price, I feel its a keeper.  Display quality, touch accuracy, software compatibility, and physical construction are only average.  At times a lock-up will occur, and there is a learning curve.  But I feel that with a little patience, the user can learn how to get the best use out of the device.  The SVP is fine for watching vids and listening to music in bed.  And I feel that there is a niche for this budget priced device...  Its bigger and nicer to use than the average smart phone and if something bed happens to it while traveling, camping, etc. its no big loss.  My advice is to take a chance on this item, especially if the price remains so attractive.Helpful Hint:  When lock-ups and other glitches occur, just do a restart while remembering that this isnt a $400-$600 device.Good luck and I hope this helps!", "Date": "May 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Crashed on the 3rd day", "Author": "patrick in Michigan", "ReviewID": "R118KOBGDYOFTM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got this as a gift from my wife and on the third day, it crashed.
