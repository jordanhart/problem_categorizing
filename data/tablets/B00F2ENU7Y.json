{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Dell Venue 8 Pro vs Lenovo Miix 8", "Author": "Amazon Lover", "ReviewID": "R1TDSDFEZE6RS6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm going to post this review under both the Dell Venue 8 Pro and the Lenovo Miix 8 as I believe some people may find the comparison helpful.I will cut to the chase and say that I have decided to keep the Venue 8 Pro and return the Lenovo Miix 8. I rated both of the devices a 5 because they are both very similar and I didn't feel it was fair to dock the Lenovo just because I preferred the Dell. If I could have rated the Lenovo 4.75, I would have.Here is what I like and dislike about both devices:1. Screen on the Dell is better than the Lenovo in my opinion. For example, in the Kindle App for Windows 8, after changing the settings to white text on black background, you get a truly \"black\" background on the Dell whereas it is more of a gray on the Lenovo. Also, the colors just seem to be more accurate on the Dell. The Lenovo offers a brighter screen but the Dell is plenty bright for me. I was also able to dim the backlight on the Dell more than the Lenovo which was helpful to me for nighttime reading. These are not major issues but it was something I noticed after comparing side by side.2. I have grown to prefer the build materials and quality of the Dell more than the Lenovo. The Lenovo is thinner and lighter which I thought was something that was important to me, but the Dell is much more comfortable to hold. This is mainly because the Dell is made from some sort of rubberized plastic material that is very \"grippy\". It just feels comfortable to hold. The Lenovo on the other hand is made from some sort of slick plastic and it always felt like I was going to drop it. Also, the Lenovo made a faint \"creaking\" and \"crackling\" sound whenever I held it.3. I originally didn't like Dell's placement of the start button on top of the device, and this was one of the reasons that I purchased the Lenovo. After using them both, I have grown to prefer Dell's implementation since I don't ever power off the device. The Start button acts as my \"on\" button and I have grown accustomed to the placement. I thought I would prefer the Lenovo with its capacitive button, but I find myself having to hit the button at least twice to activate it which is very frustrating. I realize it must be very difficult to design a capacitive button with just the right level of sensitivity, but if Surface and many Android tablets can pull it off, so should Lenovo. Hopefully both companies will figure out a way to engineer a hard button on the front like on the iPad.4. I thought I would prefer having the GPS that the Lenovo offers, but since there aren't currently any good GPS apps for Windows 8 touch devices, I didn't find much use for it. I tried it with Streets and Trips and the program would not recognize the GPS sensor.5. I get slightly better sound quality from the headphone jack of the Dell than I do with the Lenovo. It's just a minor difference and probably just a matter of personal preference, but it is something that is important to me.6. Actual user performance on both devices was about equal for me, even though the Lenovo apparently offers a slightly better processor.7. The Lenovo offers a cheaper case and stylus than the Dell. I have found the Lenovo case and stylus for as low as twenty dollars here on Amazon.8. I was able to pick up the Dell unit for twenty five dollars less than the Lenovo and see a lot of deals on the 32 gb version of the Dell. Something to consider.9. Battery life seems to be similar on both but I can't say I have performed any scientific tests to verify.Here is a list of tablets that I currently own and used as reference points in deciding whether or not to keep the Dell:1. iPad 2. I no longer have any need for this device and find it to be too limited for its size and weight. I have handed this down to my wife and kids. The kids get a LOT of mileage out of it playing various learning and leisure games. My wife mainly reads books and plays candy crush on it.2. Kindle Fire HD 8.9. I ONLY use this device because of the text to speech feature and only when I need to read something technical and/or boring for work. I tried to \"upgrade\" to the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" and later learned that Amazon crippled this amazing feature (you have to buy the audio book now) so I ended up returning the HDX. I may upgrade again if Amazon ever brings this functionality back.3. ThinkPad Tablet 2. This is my go to device for customer meetings as it is very convenient for taking notes with the screen size and dock-able stylus. That said, the device is a little slow for my taste so I'm really looking forward to the new version early next year.4. Nexus 7 (1st gen). Too slow and battery life sucks. Pretty much collects dust now but I do use it occasionally as a controller for my Sonos system.5. Surface 2. Love this device with the Type Cover 2 and use it as a bridge between my home pc (Samsung Series 7 Slate) and work pc.6. Kindle Paperwhite. Love this device for long reading sessions as I don't get any eye strain like I do on my LCD devices.7. iPad Mini (1st gen) Great for what it is, but very limited in what I can do with it. I use it mainly as a quick consumption device and ebook reader. I might end up getting rid of it now that I have decided to keep the Dell Venue 8 pro.Well, I think that is everything I wanted to share. I do want to make it clear that I like both the Dell and Lenovo very much, and would have kept the Lenovo if the Dell wasn't a choice. Thankfully, I have a choice and will stick with the Dell.", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Internal GPS, and brightest screen of all current Win 8 tablets", "Author": "Rick S", "ReviewID": "R1HN7SIBQPEJQV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had the Miix 2 8\" for two weeks, and it's definitely a keeper for me. I plan to use this for a different purpose than many of you. I need to mount this in my sailboat for use as a navigation tool (chartplotter) by the steering wheel. I've interfaced it to my boat's instruments using Bluetooth, and all the marine software that I use is written for Windows. So I have a special requirement for a Windows tablet (not Android or iOS) with an extremely bright display for daylight viewability, which this tablet excels at better than all the Windows 8 competitors out there right now. Also, this tablet has a built-in GPS, which makes it perfect for navigation. Most Windows tablets out there right now do not have GPS (though I'm sure they'll become more common over time). A quick note of warning - Windows 8.1 supports tablets with internal GPS chips in a way that only works with Metro apps, not with legacy desktop programs that expect to see the GPS on a COM port or TCP port. But there are free and low-cost programs available that will take the internal Metro GPS and emulate a COM port and/or TCP port, so you can use your old programs with it.For me, the screen brightness and GPS are the two features that make the Miix2 8\" stand out over the other 8\" tablets from Dell, Asus, and the others. Those features may not be that important to you, but if they are, this tablet deserves a long, hard look.The only significant weakness is the low audio volume, but that can be addressed with headphones or external speakers. I plan to get some Bluetooth speakers for use on my boat. The other weakness for some is the bright display. Some have complained that its minimum setting is too high to use in a dark room. Not a problem for me, but maybe it is for you.Let me also dispel a few myths that are out there:Myth 1: The Miix2 does not have a GPS. NOT TRUE. It definitely has one. It shows up in Device Manager, works with Metro apps, and works with my legacy PC software when running \"Geolocation TCP\" freeware. (Google it.)Myth 2: Because there is only one microUSB port, \"it is impossible\" charge the Miix while it's connected to an external device. (Stated in several magazine reviews.) NOT TRUE. You just need a little creativity and a few adapter cables. You need a USB Y-adapter (two Type A plugs at one end, one Mini B plug at the other end) like those used for many portable hard drives, and also a USB adapter with micro B plug on one end and Type A female receptacle at the other end. Plug the power-only USB plug (often colored red or marked \"Power only\") into the Miix's power cube (or similar 2-amp USB power supply). Plug the other type A plug into the Miix using the micro adapter. Now plug the Mini B plug into a USB 2.0 hub and you have multiple USB ports while the Miix charges that you can plug in mice, keyboards, thumb drives, or another SD card reader. All the required parts are available at Amazon or DX for a few dollars each. I had them all lying around from other old computers.Myth 3: 32 GB is not enough space. NOT TRUE (maybe). Everyone's need are different, but the first thing I did was put in a 32GB microSD card. I keep it in the microSD slot all the time, and I put everything I can on it, leaving the internal memory free for stuff that can only be installed there. It is true that there is only about 10 GB of available space on the 32 GB tablet, but 7 GB of that is contained on two recovery partitions that can be moved to an external drive, so you can get some of it back. If you need more, spend the extra $$ for the 64 GB version. But I got the 32GB because it was on sale for $100 less than the 64 GB version.Myth 4: Windows 8.1 sucks because there is no start menu. NOT TRUE. Just install Classic Shell and be done with it. With Classic Shell, it can works just like Windows 7 for PC apps, and you can always switch over to Metro apps for things that a tablet does best.The Miix2 is not meant to be your primary PC, but if you need a portable 8\" Windows tablet for under $300, this is a great one to consider.Addendum 2/9/2014:I did have some difficulty connecting a portable hard drive to the Miix through my USB hub. It worked fine if I directly connected to the microUSB port on the Miix, but would not come up when connected through the hub. The problem is probably the $5 hub and not the Miix - I recall having similar problems connecting hard drives to other computers through a hub.Mice, keyboards, thumb drives, and even additional card readers connected through the hub just fine. And when you use the Y-cable adapter mentioned in my review, you can charge the Miix at the same time you're using the external devices.", "Date": "January 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Solid Performer vs. Dell Venue 8 Pro", "Author": "Paul A. Bigelow", "ReviewID": "R2255YSEL2RLNL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Lenovo is a good tablet and should suffice for users of previous Windows tablets and those familiar with Windows 8.1Brief review and comparison vs. the Dell Venue 8 pro:Processor/Memory:The Dell has the 3740D and utilizes single channel memory -- 2GB maxThe Lenovo has the 3740 and utilizes dual channel memory -- 4GB max (but the Lenovo does not allow for a memory upgrade)A look at the System Performance file shows a 6.4 memory for the Dell and 7.1 for the Lenovo.The other performance scores are virtually identical.So theoretically, the Lenovo should be a bit more snappy but I haven't really noticed it yet in \"real world\" use.Physical:Under similar loads the Dell's back gets a bit warmer than the Lenovo's.  The Lenovo has never become *hot*, so far.The Dell *feels* nicer and more solid, the Lenovo makes a few creaking noises if flexed even a little.The Dell's buttons certainly feel better with a good tactile response, the Lenovo's feel \"mushy\".Screen:The Lenovo screen can be made the brightest, but the Dell screen can be made the darkest and looks better in a low light environment. The Dell seems to reproduce colors better at the widest angles while the Lenovo washes out (both are still, IPS though). The Dell has warmer screen temperature, the Lenovo is a bit on the cool side (partially explains the perception of brighter but the backlight is a contributor also).Sound:I'm still evaluating the sound, Dell has released an update for both firmware and screen.Misc:Haven't tried the Dell active pen, no one locally has it. A Targus aluminum barreled capacitive stylus works pretty good.  Both have good handwriting recognition.The Dell has the more feature-ladden BIOS while the Lenovo's is fairly simple. The Dell also has a nice hardware diagnostic menu/program as well.The Lenovo camera allows for panoramic shots the Dell does not (same Windows app version)The Lenovo has GPS the Dell does not.I had to return my first Lenovo as the SD card slot was broken and wouldn't hold the sdcard. The second Lenovo was fine.Impression:The Lenovo is a fine, if not extraordinarily well-built tablet.  Snappy performance.", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Dell venue 8 pro is better despite being barely heavier", "Author": "Mike", "ReviewID": "R1GXKANE2WW5M1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this as well as the dell venue 8 pro and the dell one is better for a few reasons. The display is more color accurate, touch screen taps are more accurate, the WiFi speed and signal strength are better when placed in the exact same location and connected to the exact same AP, the build quality is more durable, and the speaker volume goes around twice as loud. No joke.I have to admit that the mix had a slightly better camera and was lighter, but the above features were more important to me.", "Date": "November 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "excellent hybrid tablet for work/play", "Author": "Wirt W. Cross Jr.", "ReviewID": "R1BPK7YLLDQLTN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "At work I use word and power point quite frequently.  I am also more comfortable with windows vs. mac.  I bought an ipad 2 back in the day, and just never used it that much.  Oh, it was fun for the first week or 2, but after that I realized I'd surf the net occasionally or play a game or 2 on it but that was it.  Once the windows tablets started coming out I was interested in seeing how they worked.  the surface was not for me because I don't like the idea of a windows lite.  I'd rather have a full version, but the fact they had power point and word seemed pretty nice.  I needed something the was portable and able to be comfortably held in one hand so I continued to wait.  I almost got an ipad mini but held out, and I am definitely glad I did.  I started looking into the miix2 when my wife got the miix 10.  It seemed pretty nice but too big.  I saw a review about a pending offer from lenovo the miix 2  I happened to check amazon and lo and behold the had it in stock.  i ordered it immediately and it arrived 2 days later.External appearance: Opening the box I was very pleased with it's initial looks.  It seems very sturdy, maybe aluminum or something but there was certainly no flimsiness that i noted.  I didn't like all the stickers on the back but they peeled off very easily and you can't tell they were ever there.  It has a micro usb an SC card slot and a headphone jack.  Speakers on the back one on top of each other and front and rear facing cameras.  Windows button in good position bottom center.  Plugged it in and after a few hours charge booted it up.First use: Set up went just fine without a glitch.  Mine didn't have the facial recognition software which I would have removed anyways.  The apps preset were fairly minimal in keeping with lenovo's other offerings. I also removed mcaffee and several other non-essential aps without difficulty.  The uninstall is extremely easy.  Windows 8 is a great OS.  I use 7 on my other computers but I really like 8 so far.  The really nice thing is word, power point, excel, and one note are all there to be installed using the key provided in the packaging.  Also while trying to get used to the new start screen, the desktop was literally a touch away.  I installed itunes just to see if I could and that brings up another plus. This is full windows.  If there isn't an app for something you need you can just install the program (size pending obviously).  I don't need a citrix receiver app, I just install the client and it boots up.  I can also port into my home or work cpu without difficulty.  I have used this almost exclusively for the past 2 weeks and still love it.  Although the ipad was never a laptop replacement I can see this tablet being close.  I have a bluetooth keyboard and power point and word are with me wherever.Screen: Very nice very bright.  people have complained that the black isn't black but I found that by fiddling with the adjustments it a pretty good pure black to me.  the contrast is very nice and the high def is great for me. Although like any other tablet it collects smudges, they don't seem to interfere with visibility that much.Sound: Speakers are fine, nothing great but adequate.  Certainly not busy airport loud, but I use headphones mostly.Speed: I am very happy with the speed of internet connection as well as processing.  Another plus is that I can run 2 apps/programs simultaneously without losing noticeable speed.  I'm working on a powerpoint and need info I bring up chrome to one side and get the info.  This is extremely useful.Storage size:  I have the 32 GB, and can see needing more space but with the SD slot you can just add a card and viola you have it.  There is also a 128 GB coming out that should be great.Battery life:I haven't tested it extensively, but I typically plug it in at night and haven't lost power during the day yet.  I use it modestly though.  Not sure how far it'd last if you were on it literally all day.Work use:  I already alluded to this but i am able to do pretty much everything I need to for my business on this it really is very close to being a laptop replacement. (If you have vision impairments (wear glasses, etc) the small screen may be an issue plus it you need a larger display this won't work as well but for me it's great.Apps:  the windows App store is still a bit light although getting better per report.  There's also a lenovo app store which seems a waste of time but there are some exclusive apps there. If all you want is games, the ipad of android may be better, although xbox is getting a larger presence on the windows platforms and I can see them starting to push exclusive content. Just something to think about.Overall durability:  I have been using think pads for almost a decade now from back when IBM still made them and am definitely slightly biased as I think they are hands down the best laptops.  The Miix 2 is definitely in keeping with their reputation for sturdiness.  Now bear in mind its a tablet and I'm not going to go around dropping it just to see, but it certainly feels sturdy and the screen seems tough.Overall: Great tablet I'm recommending to everyone I work with and anyone who reads the reviews on amazon.  I bought a screen cover which I'd recommend anyone buying this to do ( they literally cost only a few bucks) and a evercase thin case for it both of which are great additions to make this a perfect tablet for me.  The case was under $10 when I bought it and is very nice.  Great value for the cost.", "Date": "December 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice Tablet (better than Venue 8 Pro, IMO)", "Author": "B. Harris", "ReviewID": "R9REB02F1M2Y9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ordered the Miix 2 8 after giving up on the Dell Venue 8 Pro.  Both Dell models I tried suffered from touch issues causing keys to repeat when typing and gestures and taps to be misinterpreted.  Just search online for \"dell venue 8 pro sensitivity\" and you'll find a thread on Dell's forums (but ignored by Dell) about the issue.  It was even worse when trying to use any kind of screen protector.I've only had the Miix 2 8 briefly, but so far I am impressed.  Will update my review and rating accordingly.Won't rehash what others have said better than I can, but I did want to address a few topics that haven't already been covered or with which I differ/disagree.Wifi Speed: I've seen several people mention wifi speed as an advantage of the Venue over the Miix 2.  I believe the problem is that, by default, the Miix 2 wifi isn't taking full advantage of it's hardware. If you go to the Advanced properties of the Broadcom wireless adapter, there is an option to choose \"Bandwidth Capability\".  By default, it is set to only use both the 20Mhz and 40Mhz bands on 11a networks.  This limits the maximum connection speed on 11n networks to 150Mbs.  If you change the setting to \"11a/b/g:20/40Mhz\", this will allow it to connect at the full capability of 300Mbs.  I had a Dell laptop with the same default limitation.Speaker: For me, the speaker volume which others have discussed isn't a huge issue.  The Dell was definitely louder and fuller, but the Miix 2 isn't terrible.Display: I personally prefer the display on the Miix 2 over the Venue.  Both are very nice, but the Miix 2 is clearly brighter.  I also feel that text appears sharper on the Miix 2.  I used my Datacolor Sypder colorimeter on both devices to calibrate the displays.  The Dell was more accurately calibrated from the factory, but the Miix 2 looks better after calibration and has better color reproduction/gamut - ~75% sRGB for the Miix 2 vs only ~65% sRGB for the Dell.USB: Using an OtG adapter, the Venue could only access low-power USB devices like flash drives.  Portable 2.5\" drives or DVD drives simply wouldn't work.  These higher-power devices do work on the Miix 2 without needing separate/supplemental power.Charging: The Venue can only be charged with it's own charging block.  The Miix 2 can be charged from other USB power sources/chargers.Resolution: In researching the available 8\" Windows 8 tablets, I've seen many individuals and reviewers knock them because of the relatively low 1280x800 resolution.  Many people said that the upcoming Thinkpad 8 (with a resolution of 1920x1200) was the one to wait for.  As much as I wanted the higher build quality and specs of the Thinkpad 8, the higher resolution was actually the reason I did NOT want it.  Unfortunately, the Retina world of iOS is a very different environment than Windows 8.  High resolution displays simply aren't handled well in Windows or with Windows applications - specifically classic desktop applications.  One option is to use 100% - in which case UI elements will be so ridiculously tiny on a high PPI screen that they can't be seen on the 8\" display.  The second option is to use Windows' DPI scaling to increase icon and text size, but then the problem is that many applications (and even some aspects of Windows) don't properly support/implement scaling (or don't do it at all) resulting in content that doesn't display properly or is actually less legible/sharp than 100% at 1280x800.  The third option is to run the 1920x1200 panel at a reduced resolution (i.e. 1680x1050) to make elements slightly larger, but running an LCD panel at a non-native resolution will always result in blurry text and is defeating the purpose of having a higher resolution LCD.  Another thing to keep in mind is that if you plan to establish any RDP connections to any other systems from an 8\" Windows tablet, it's not possible to use DPI scaling on remote sessions.I have seen comments elsewhere saying that using a cheap OtG plus power adapter for devices like the Nexus 7 and Galaxy S3 will allow simultaneous charging and use of the USB port.  I'll have to give this a try and see.  This definitely won't work with the Venue.I've also seen comments saying that cheap MHL USB/microHDMI adapters allow HDMI out directly from the USB port without additional hardware.  I will likely experiment with this, too.  Have seen that this option also does not work on the Venue.", "Date": "February 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "A tablet that can work seamlessly with desktop", "Author": "C.

Alberts", "ReviewID": "R710IYWCYZDAM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I won a Miix2 8 at a company event, and bought a second one for myself.  Both managed, within a few days of each other, to fall from about 2.5; off of a desk.  In both cases, the bezel separated from the back (it was in a protective case, and this still occurred).  Now that's bad enough, but to make matters worse the way the power button is situated, separating the bezel from the back causes it to pull out of the hinge, making it impossible to turn on or off if you reconnect the bezel right away.  If this happens to you, it's fixable but you have to be careful.  Take a butter knife and remove the back carefully.  Go to the power button and you'll see that any little bezel separation will cause the button to come out of its little hinge.  Replace the button into the hinge and replace the back.  This isn't a big deal if you have a lot of experience fixing computers or other gadgets, but it's sort of ridiculous that an 8\" tablet has a build quality like this.  If I need to buy another one, I think I'd look at the Dell or the Thinkpad 8 instead as the build quality seems better on both of those.  And even though you can fix this issue, the power button is sort of ridiculously small and difficult to turn on or off while in the case compared to a Surface RT or the Dell.Beyond the build quality, the machine works as advertised--fairly snappy, the screen is bright and clear, and Windows 8.1 seems practically made for this device size.

Speedy processor and strong and stable WiFi (benchmarked faster than my Lenovo B570 laptop!). GPS works perfectly (not sure if it has an onboard compass though). Very responsive touchscreen and although at first I admittedly didn't like windows 8, after a month of learning how to use it I honestly think it's the best system for touchscreen computers available. Runs legacy Windows programs like a champ as well.As for the Dell Venue; Although much ado has been made about the Miix2 speaker volume vs the Dell Venue 8 Pro, I had both units and although the Dell speaker is louder it exhibits a great deal of harmonic distortion. On the other hand the Lenovo has a very clean sound. Seems plenty loud to me and I'm a musician by trade. The Dell also claims to have a longer battery life, but they play a trick by testing the battery charge with the screen greatly dimmed down. Lenovo tested their battery life with the screen at normal brightness and contrast. The colors were also rather \"odd\" on the Dell and the whites on the screen weren't quite white. The Venue is also considerably heavier than the Miix2 which can become an issue if you often use it as a handheld reader. But the worst issue is the terrible placement of the Windows button on the Venue. You search for it constantly.I wouldn't hesitate to buy this tablet again.  I've watched movies on it in several formats that neither the iPad nor Android will play, surfed many flash websites, played games, downloaded the Kindle app and used it as a reader.

I personally like mine, but then I also like and enjoy my iPad (First Gen 3G), and plan to buy an iPad Air to replace that iPad later in 2015.  This tablet is more of a splurge/impulse buy from Best Buy (they had it for $200 on the weekend of 3/8).  It's supposed to be a toy and a hands-on for Windows 8.1Pro -- The machine has surprisingly decent firepower for multi-threaded tasks - it feels like a similarly clocked notebook PC from 2009.  If you bought a CULV machine from back then, well, it's about that fast.  To translate from non-geek, it's about as fast as the first 3 generations of the 11 Inch MacBook Air.- VMX mode (virtualization) is enabled by default, so it is possible, in theory, to run something else alongside.- Graphics performance is decent enough for games made before, say, 2006 - Half-life 2 should run \"okay\" on it with native resolution - it does have a cut-down version of Intel's Ivy Bridge GPU (think of it as like the Intel HD2200, the 4EU version of the 6EU HD2500).  Stuff like Nintendo 64 and/or Sony PSX emulation is do-able, if not entirely friendly to your battery.- Comes with Quicksync, so video transcoding on the tablet is possible.  Just grab the right version of Handbrake Nightly with QS support, and use it to convert some downloaded videos to your smartphone.  Yeah, use your tablet to make videos for your Android or Blackberry 10 phone (or if you really like to mess your tablet up, run iTunes on it so you can synch it with your iOS devices...and shoot yourself in the foot while at it).  That's so wrong but it feels so right.- Comes with a full version of Microsoft Office 2013 Personal and Students edition for free (not the Office 365 demo, the actual Office 2013 suite).  You could conceivably do some work on it.- Dualband, dual antenna wireless capable (decent wireless network speeds if you have a recent wireless access point)- Decent camera quality (and the panoramic picture mode is nice to play with)- Broadcom GNSS GPS receiver. it's GPS but not standard full NMEA stanza GPS.  If you plan to use it to replace your Garmin....eh, buy Centrafuse Localizer ($5) so it can translate the GNSS data into something-kinda-NMEA for compatibility purposes.- Bluetooth 4.0 Low energy capable- Ability to read from external hard drives, USB sticks and most other USB accessories.  I actually use it to connect the machine to my office internal network via ethernet.  Just buy a Micro USB OTG adapter if you wish to do that, and look for one that can do power injections (it's a Y-cable) if you want to run devices while keeping your battery charged.- If you really need to do so, the USB OTG can be combined with the freely available Asus AiPower utility to act as an emergency phone charger.Yeah, I'm not kidding about this one.  You can use your tablet to charge your phone if you have the right cable and the right sofware utility to do so.  It's just not very fast nor very efficient to do so.Con -- 32 bit OS - Seriously guys, selling a 32 bit OS with 64 Bit hardware in 2014?!  The iPad Air has a 64 Bit ARM chip and half the RAM, and it comes with an iOS 7 64 bit build.  This is probably due to the 64 Bit Connected Standby not-ready problem hitting all the Bay Trail Atom Tablets.  Lenovo MIGHT roll a 64 Bit clean variant later on as an upgrade, but I strongly doubt it.- It only has 2GB of RAM, and Windows 8 occupies about 1GB.  You also do not have the ability to upgrade.  So running more than a few apps at a time is straight out- No separate power port, everything goes through that one Micro USB port.  If it fails you are up the creek.- No video out - no HDMI, no MicroHDMI, and no MHL.  So unless you grab a Displaylink or Miracast adapter, what you see is the only thing you'll get.- Comes with a TPM chip...of questionable utility.- 32 Bit Connected Standby Mode - the thing that helps the Atom get the great battery life, but also really held the tablet to 32 Bit Windows.  Also messes with the clockspeed of the tablet and make it laggy in the high draw titles...like the N64 emulators.- Doesn't have a conventional BIOS, so you cannot boot into an alternative OS easily - no 64 Bit Linux for you, and Linux that boots off 32 Bit UEFI is rare.- Windows 8.1 is still a headache - not really feasible as a mobile OS, really - think of it as like the 2013 equivalent of a touch friendly netbook (or better yet, the good old UMPC).  When you have to navigate 4 menus to turn bluetooth on and off one just has to wonder who fell asleep in their UI design department.- Really needs better casing options.

Chien", "ReviewID": "R30C7E32F3N6C1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Notes from a week of use (IT power user, used everything since the TRS-80 days):+ Light enough of a tablet to be used one-handed for an hour or so of ebook reading. Not immediately 'heavy' like the Nook HD+, which really begs two-handed or lap use from the start. Well-balanced in portrait or landscape.+ Nice curves! Rounded, smooth, nothing that'll catch on your fingers or hands as you hold it and rotate it about. Like holding a polished skipping stone.+ Decently bright screen. Easy meets and slightly exceeds the brightness of a Nook HD+, though still not as bright as the Nokia 603 at 800 nits. Notebookcheck's site has their brightness tests of the three major 8\" tablets out right now (Miix 2, Excite, Venue).  Brightness indoors easily goes from borderline too bright at the lowest setting in a dark bedroom at night to bright enough to read with the sunlight coming through a silk curtained window in daytime with the highest brightness setting.  Really no complaints of note here.+ Color temp is a nice white, not a touch yellow like the Nook HD+. Colors on the Photodisc test target look IPS great (esp. skin tones)! Images pop. Really happy with this display.+ No visible touch-screen lines unlike the Toshiba Excite, which is mared by this problem. 'Soft' feel to the surface, slick, nice and very responsive =) Never a touch-issue.+ Never runs HOT like the Dell Venue, which gets far too hot at one point on the back. See notebookcheck reviews and you'll see why the Venue becomes too hot to comfortably hold at times, the Miix 2 is always just a touch warm and okay to hold.+ Charges far faster than the hours and hours Nook HD+. Like a cellphone for charge speeds, can go from 25-50% in less than an hour plugged in.+ Baby pocket rocket tablet! No significant lag on most common uses (word, web, MP4 playback, etc). Runs everything just like a desktop, which means Miix 2 = Apple and Android tablet KILLER!! =D  Seriously!!  Have had and tried everything from iPads to Nooks and short of the Lenovo Yoga, this baby kills non-Windows tablets.  Web browsing? No problems at all - full site access with full Flash, Adobe, etc. plugins. Easy tube downloading through Firefox with Download Helper. Full torrent, Netflix, Hulu, etc. capabilities, etc.  Office, remote desktop, etc.  (Okay, a few things it can't do due to 32-bit OS...)+ Finally, the ONLY platform that let's you run both desktop EPWING dictionaries through EBPocket and view eBooks at the same time in two side-by-side windows Win8-style for studying foreign languages. And full foreign language input capabilities, with pen/handwritten input, for easy input of even the most complex Chinese characters.  Android, eg. using Nook HD+, was the closest with 3rd party handwritten keyboard, but no dual-apps running simultaneously on-screen meant lots of needless app switching.+ No issues with MKVs, 1080p MP4s, MPGs, DVD rips, subs, etc. playback, naturally. MPHC, VLC, WinAmp, etc. all run just like any other PC =D No need to worry about conversion, bitrates too high, funky sub formats, etc. EVERYTHING plays fine. (Unlike Android where even all the media players couldn't handle EVERYTHING I tossed at them.)+ MicroSD port. Push in slightly to eject. No audible sound. Cover is a plastic flap. Works fine with 32MB class 10 MicroSD cards. Haven't tested anything bigger yet.+ Regular USB to MicroUSB (OTG) cable works fine for connecting to printers, etc. Nice. Plugged in my all-in-one Epson and could scan and print in under a minute after driver install.+ Sony Vegas Video 11 runs fine on this. Can do basics like fading between two 1080p clips on the timeline without much fuss. Generally on the more responsive side, so useable as a mobile editing platform.+ Built-in cameras that can take 1920x1080 ~20Mbps, 29.97fps progressive, AAC 192 48khz MP4 video from the back.  Nice in daylight, decent resolution and detail, okay in low-light, but not 'horrible' or 'unusable'.+ Runs all 32-bit programs like VLC, Media Player Home Classic, WinRAR, Adobe Acrobat Reader, Office 2013, etc.+ Can run Nokia HERE MAPS and download offline maps for use with the built-in GPS....except, Nokia still hasn't gotten the license to include maps for JAPAN yet after all these years! >.< Certainly is handy to have maps of all other major countries offlined on this tablet - far easier to download than all other mapping programs since each region/area is one download file rather than thousands of 'tiles' ala OpenStreetMaps/Google/MapQuest/etc. screen scraping map offloading programs.  (Haven't tested the GPS unit yet...)+ LOUD speakers.  Have absolutely no idea what others are saying, but I can have this in a noisy buffet restaurant packed with a hundred people yapping away and at full volume, can easily listen to music videos, etc.  Easily exceeds the volume I regularly set my car audio deck at 45MPH on about 3/4 volume when used in my car.  Think 'cellphone-like' speaker and you'll be fine (Pocket AM/FM radio sound for you analog types.)+ Bluetooth tethering to Nokia 603 works fine (...but see below, no adhoc)+ Power on/off/volume buttons require enough pressure not to be accidentally pressed in most cases.+ Can't beat the two Franklin price point! Nukes every other tablet in the range out of the market. Nooks from one hundred to the Tabs and minis at three. And once you're up beyond three, it's time to look at the superior Yoga series, which honestly kills everything out there for most uses short of a high-end, i7 1080+ IPS panel, fast gaming GPU notebook.+ Runs Office. Full Office. Complete Desktop Office 2013 =D  No issues now opening, editing, creating any Office document for work, school, etc. This alone kicks the other OS tablets to the curb IMO.+ Easily pushes 5+ hours of mixed surfing and downloading without running out of battery. One of those tablets where you can run through a 8-hour work/school day without worrying about bringing the AC charger. (Naturally, turn brightness down, Airplane mode whenever you're not online.)- 32-bit Windows! And only 2GB RAM.CPU can run 64-bit OSs and 4GB, so sad you can't install and run memory-intensive, 64-bit apps. Lenovo also doesn't have 64-bit drivers for upgrading yourself. No Premiere CC >.< No Visual Studio 2013 >.< Virtualize and run portable apps to get around this, offloading things like Photoshop to the MicroSD card.- A touch slow at picking up rotation. Not sure yet if it's OS (likely) or by design. Just a half second or so, but sometimes, you have to bump it on the edge to rotate.- Speaker is on the back. >.< Sigh... When will cellphone and tablet designers wake up and stop doing stupid things like placing speakers on the opposite side of the human?!? Should be on the front, so you'll have to cup the speaker with your hand or use a waveguide to direct all of the sound to the front where you are.- Too bad it doesn't have a regular USB sized port built-in. They could have made a baby bump on one edge and used that to include HDMI, too, which isn't included.- Only one USB port that can be used to charge, or for connecting to devices. Thus, external HUB is required. Wished they had two or more ports.- Windows 8.1 issue - NO ADHOC connection to cellphones (eg. Joikuspot on Nokia)!!!! Very, very annoying, Microsoft >.< - It is slick like a polished stone. Too bad no hand strap port for use with a hand-strap. It can slip out of the hands - put a strip of textured cloth or rubber tape on the back to fix this. But still better than the ugly Venue rubber back.- Only 32GB. Office + Win8.1 + a handful of simple apps results in about 5GB free.- WiFi antenna/module isn't as good as on a laptop/desktop with multi-antennas/etc. 3 bars Miix 2 vs 5 bars Z580 at one location with a distant router (showing about -85dB in Inssider). But at least it's a/b/g/n, so it'll connect to about everything short of ac.- Too bad no built-in FM radio. Heck, even my Nokia 603 has a built-in FM radio. Modules can't be that expensive.- No power option besides a basic BALANCED. Can't control CPU speed using default OS shipped. (Maybe there's a 3rd party?)- Typical Win-Classic side adjusting of fonts and display settings to get things big enough to read comfortably. Win 8 side is generally fine.- 9\" Nook HD+ Screen is about the right size for full page comic book reading in portrait mode, so this 8\" Miix 2 begs to be turned landscape and scrolled. Thus, you'll have to decide whether you want a one-page, scroll-free view of your comics, etc. or not before buying a tablet of this size. Very responsive with 4-cores, so it's not been an issue here reading ebooks.", "Date": "March 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "I never thought I'd like a tablet - until now", "Author": "Val Gameiro", "ReviewID": "R35UONVSA58SPM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got my first Lenovo Miix 2 8\" tablet for Xmas 2013. I had been resisting getting a tablet, even though my wife had owned her iPad for years, and loved it. I'm a writer and a filmmaker (in my spare time) so I thought I would always want/need a physical keyboard. For that reason, I bought a Lenovo S10 Netbook, and loved it. Last Xmas my wife persuaded me to buy a tablet, and I finally gave in, but misunderstood the sales rep and didn't buy the accidental damage plan -- BIG MISTAKE! If you buy a tablet, make sure you get at least their 1-year accidental damage protection. I ended up buying mine at Best Buy, but Office Depot's accidental damage plan prices are about half.At any rate, I knew I needed/wanted a Windows 8 tablet instead of Android or iPad, because I already have a lot of software I use on my Netbook. If I want a regular keyboard, I can use that to write, but if I want to be mobile (surfing the net while in bed, or watch some Hulu or Netflix) I use my tablet. It's great for traveling, much easier to handle and put away, and because it is not a \"larger electronic device\" I can keep it on the whole time on the plane.I like the size at 8\" -- the 7\" was too small, and the 10\" too big (I know because I tried a Microsoft Surface 1st gen and it was too heavy and bulky to handhold on a plane).I also like that you don't have to join the Microsoft collective to use the tablet -- I have my own cloud storage set up so I'm using a local account instead of a Microsoft account -- VERY happy about that. I use OwnCloud for this.Pros:Light, boots up fast, runs most Windows programs I need (within the 2GB RAM limit). You can plug it in to your laptop or computer and it will charge. You can also use a regular USB to Micro USB adapter to connect external drives. You do not need a USB OTG (on the go) adapter for this tablet. You can plug in a USB hub and connect multiple USB peripherals at the same time. Good finger friendly interface. Able to run Modern Apps and Desktop Apps. The Metro/Modern interface is pretty good on a tablet (I don't like it on a desktop or a phone, though).Cons:Only has 2GB of RAM, and you can't expand it. These are fragile, and if you drop it, it will more than likely break - at least the glass screen. When I broke mine and called Lenovo, because I didn't have a protection plan, the replacement glass alone was $200, and I only paid $300 for it... hardly worth it. You can pretty much only use self-powered hard drives with this thing. This isn't as popular as the iPad so there aren't quite as many accessories available. Had a hard time finding a good case that wasn't pink or purple :(  The Windows Store is a lot sparser than the Android store, or the Apple store... but there are quite a few apps there, and Microsoft has released a free tool (Project Siena) to allow people to create apps easily.Bottom Line:When my original one broke... I saved up to get a second one... with accidental damage plan. I tried a Dell Venue Pro 8, and I wasn't happy with it. This is definitely my favorite tablet. Get it if you want/need Windows apps and you want portability. Definitely get a decent case to protect it, along with an accidental damage protection plan.", "Date": "February 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Terrible", "Author": "Lucy", "ReviewID": "R2QKJA9LMGO7U1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "So frustrated with this due to a bunch of bugs. It froze a few times while I was doing something so I had to do a hard shutdown but 3 freezes in 14 days was forgivable. What is not forgivable is that EVERY day when putting it to sleep or shutting it down it would freeze. Putting it to sleep makes no sense because it would drain about 10% battery per hour...sometimes it would wake up from sleep without needing to do a hard shutdown but is not worth using unless I was coming back to it in 30 minutes to an hour. Shutting down would not drain the battery IF it shut down correctly. When it shut down correctly it would take about 5 seconds to restart which was great. Half the time you would think it was shut down though but it wasn't and it would drain the battery at an alarming rate. Last night I shut it down at 95% battery and when I woke up it was totally dead. I had to plug it in to start it and the battery was 1%. I've googled this and many others have had the same issues. I tried some supposed fixes by changing the Wi-Fi settings but it did not work. I wanted so much for this to work out. It is pretty nice and if not for these simple issues it would be a keeper.

Here are some comments:1.  This is my first use of Win8 (actually, Win8.1) with a touchscreen.  I can see the usefulness of using Win8 this way.  On a laptop or desktop, I find it much easier to use Win7.2.  I am disappointed so far in Lenovo's support of this tablet.  If you go to their website and look up \"parts\" or other service info for the Mixx2 8, you will find VERY little information.  I am trying to work thru a problem with WiFi on my unit.  Device Manager says that the WiFi system is by Broadcom, and the driver that is installed is from Broadcom.  But the Lenovo website says that the WiFi system is by \"Hiking\" and they provide a driver for it.  I'm very confused and don't know what to do. But, if you've ever owned any \"Think\" product, you'll know and appreciate that IBM/Lenovo has always made it very easy to find and install updates and firmware for your device, using System Update.  At least so far, there is no similar service for this tablet, and so it is very difficult to find an install updates.3.  Along the lines of #2, above - there is no forum that I've found to communicate with the company or other owners about this issue.  And Lenovo has on their website addresses or numbers to deal with questions about \"Think\" or \"Idea\" branded products, but there is nothing to indicate where the Mixx fits in.  Frustrating.4.  Using an 8\" tablet to work with Windows programs is difficult.  I use a program called Multiplay, in which you have to use the program's icons.  To touch an icon on an 8\" screen is very difficult.  I use the stylus that came with my flip cover, but it's not as good as using the touchpad on a laptop.5.  Typing on the screen is much better than I thought it would be.  Navigation is good.  The system is very responsive.6.  WiFi so far is not very reliable.  On networks at work or my home network, sometimes I'm able to connect with no problems and other times I'm not able to connect at all.  I find that changing the WiFi driver from \"Broadcom\" to the \"Microsoft\" helps.  Why it keeps changing back to \"Broadcom\" is a mystery.  Again, I wish I could discuss this on a forum, but I can't find one.7.  I feel VERY limited by not having a SIM card for this unit.  For this tablet, which I got when it was first released, there was no SIM option available - only WiFi.  If I had the choice, I would DEFINITELY get the SIM option.  I don't know if newer Miix tablets are offered with SIM, but if they are, I would recommend that.  I'm GUESSING that the Thinkpad version of this tablet (which I read about in one of these reviews/comments) will offer that option, and I'd think I would be happier with that one.8.  In conclusion, I think that this tablet is good as to see what Win8 in a touch environment can do.  But I'm not able to reliably get any real work done with it, I'm disappointed in Lenovo's website support (so far), and I think the \"Thinkpad version\" of this tablet would make a better choice for anything more than media consumption (reading or videos or games).  For now, I'm still happiest with my X220 Thinkpad, after using an iPad with ClamCase Pro and a Galaxy Note 2 and the Miix2 8\".", "Date": "January 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Already obsolete - await ThinkPad 8 - end of January 2014", "Author": "anonymous", "ReviewID": "R15SVZYQS5Z63C", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "As with any technology as soon as you receive something it is already obsolete - particularly true in this case as Lenovo is slated to start shipping the ThinkPad 8 with an 8.3 screen, a faster processor, optional keyboard/case and most importantly a micro-HDMI port at the end of January 2014.Attention: GPS on the ThinkPad 8 will only come with the 3g/4g/LTE models due out later.Someone has written that both the Lenovo Miix 2 8 and the Dell Venue Pro 8 are just toys without HDMI output.

I do IT support for a living and eventually I'm going to have to deal with Windows 8 so I needed an inexpensive device to learn it on.  I've been using the iPad since they first came out and my go-to tablet is currently an iPad mini.  That is inevitably going to color my opinion of this device.  I'm going to limit my comments here to the tablet itself not windows 8 as I am new to the OS and am having the expected learning curve.Build Quality:  Nowhere near iPad quality.  The back is covered with stickers.  The most important of them is the one containing the Lenovo product information and serial number.  Guess which one is starting to peel off after less than a week.  Right! The Lenovo sticker.  There is a bit of give on the left side of the tablet about 1/3 of the way up from the bottom where it feels as though the back has warped a bit and isn't quite seated against either the display or the other components.  It cheapens the feel of the tablet but doesn't affect anything else.  The microSD card slot doesn't seem to latch to the SD card properly and the card will randomly disconnect from the computer. Reseating the SD card fixes the problem until next time.  The buttons on the right side are easily found and have sufficient feel that you know that they have been pressed without requiring enough force to be irritating.  The capacitive windows button on the lower front engages positively.  I haven't had very many accidental presses of it which is better than I expected.  The sound is terrible without headphones and fine with them.  This isn't a major issue for me; if you need great speakers, look elsewhere.Performance:  I'm actually quite pleased.  I was expecting rather sluggish performance and the tablet surprises me.  It does what I typically use a tablet for only slightly slower than my iPad mini (old version) and hasn't been an issue with anything I typically use a tablet for.Issues:  The biggest issue I've run into is the failure to wake-up from the sleep state.  When I'm using a tablet for something I need to grab it and use it.  On both my iPad and the Android tablets I've used, this isn't a problem.  Press a button, swipe, enter your PIN or whatever your are using to lock the tablet and go.  The same is true here if the tablet hasn't been asleep for a couple of hours at a time.  Then, it is a case of grab the tablet, press the windows key (nothing); try again (nothing); hold power button down for 10 seconds to power the tablet off. (Note that there is no feedback to indicate the tablet is off or still asleep.)  Release the power button.  Press the power button for a second or two until the Lenovo logo comes up and the tablet boots.  The boot is quite fast but by the time I've gone through this I could have done what I needed on any Android tablet or iPad and gone on to something else.  This is a MAJOR issue for me.  On the iPad, the only time I ever power it off is during an IOS update.  On the Lenovo, I've had to forcibly shut down two and three times a day either to recover from a no-wake-up condition or a random freeze.Apps:  I'm not going to dwell on this as it isn't a Lenovo issue; it's generic to Windows 8.  I have been able to find all the apps that I needed although they seem to be less well thought out than either the Android or IOS versions.  There are some glaring exceptions; Amazon instant video for example; but, for the most part I can do with this tablet the same things I frequently use on my iPad.As I said at the beginning, I bought this as a learning tool and it is useful for that.

I researched long and hard for a lightweight, portable full windows device that runs Microsoft Office and doesn't break the bank.

It took me a full three days to finally successfully connect the device to the internet, only to have it disconnect again on sleep. I've tried everything (updated/uninstalled/reinstalled drivers, run through the whole troubleshooting menu, turn it off and on, etc.) and nothing works. In fact, when I turn on the wireless network connection, it just turns itself back off again for no reason. Also, bluetooth won't detect my bluetooth keyboard anymore. I don't have hours to waste looking up help forums and fiddling with this machine to get it to do the basic task of connecting to a wireless signal that works with every other device in my house. I would have liked this tablet otherwise, but what's the point of having a tablet if you can't even get online?

I don't usually write review but I was so excited reading everyone's positive reviews, and I was so eager to receive this tablet and put it in service. Finally a good x86/x64 tablet you can actually use for work and play!Let's see -- I was going to use this tablet to access my car's ECU and use it as a vehicle diagnostic dashboard, and performance logging device. It comes with built in GPS/GNSS!!! That meant I will be able to log my fuel injection statistics and how it affects the speed of the vehicle in relationship to the fuel adjustments I make.. How awesome?In the spare time, this was going to be my couch toy.Boy was I disappointed when I found out the GPS/GNSS sensor does not work with your legacy apps that require communication over NMEA 0183 / COM port. The sensor can only be accessed by Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 applications written in Visual Studio using Windows' propitiatory API. If you are buying this to because it has GPS/GNSS sensor... Then look some where else.There is one company that makes conversion software \"centrafuse localizer\". It will make your legacy applications work with this GPS/GNSS however, the resolution is awful and slow...This sensor was only meant to be used as a location beacon so websites could provide you with targeted advertising....The wireless is slow. Even at 802.11g speeds, with device next to the wireless router, I was getting 1Mbps with serious packet loss. I'm a network engineer and this reminds me of 802.11b communicating at long distance behind a concrete wall...The eMMc storage chip is very slow. The device will boot fast, but some apps that require a lot of disk reads will be very slow to load. Other apps like \"calc\" and \"paint\" start instantly...  Opening word files takes a bit....RAM is slow too.The device ships with Windows 8.1 32bit, however the CPU is 64bit. You will not be able to change the OS because of the 32bit UEFI bios. No where is this mentioned on Lenovo's site... Really Lenovo? I am disappointing.  You will not be able to run 64bit Windows applications.Battery life is great... No complaints there.It's still a great device, and things have come a long way ahead. The intended target audience for this device is non-technical hipsters that need to run Microsoft Office, and Powerpoint, and don't want to lug a laptop with them.I'm sending mine back for a refund.

If you want this tablet, I suggest the 64GB rather than the 32GB. This device only had 10GB of free space out-the-box. Windows OSs are space hogs by definition. Windows Updates could eat through that 10GB alone. Next, this was advertised as having Microsoft Office Home & Student Edition 2013 preloaded. I found that this was not the case. I could download the trial version (that would've eaten up about 5GB), but I had to purchase a key code if I wanted full access to MS Office. Also, it took forever for me to get to the appropriate support area from Lenovo. (I called because I was under the impression that I would be receiving full MS Office.) And they didn't transfer me around a phone tree. They gave me the phone number, kindly said goodbye, and hung up on me. (Auto System) Other than that, yes I'll agree that it's a nifty little device.

Windows 8.1 (Microsoft) can take the full blame for the failure of this product; the operating system (Win 8.1) is slow, sluggish and demanding on the processor and memory that it resembles a computer today running XP.  This does not function like a tablet should for 2013, the first iPhone was better put together, heck, LG probably makes a smartphone more usable than this.I don't recommend this, but I VERY MUCH look forward to SSD tablets that functionally run full operating systems with great components and plenty of drive space!  On that note, we should be demanding that companies like Microsoft, Apple and Samsung release excellent top technological devices with components that rival any laptop because the technology is here and it's cheap!
