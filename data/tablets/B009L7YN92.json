IT CAME PRE LOADED WITH MOST BASIC APPS. AND CONNECTED EASY TO GOOGLE PLAY WERE YOU CAN DOWNLOAD TON'S OF FREE OR PAID APPS. I WENT TO YOU TUBE AND IT WORKED FAST AND PLAYED GOOD, I BROWSED ONLINE ON EACH TABLET AND THEY ALL SEEMED JUST ABOUT THE SAME SPEED AS MY NOOK, AND I PAD ( OR NOT MUCH DIFFERENT) VOLUME IS NOT VERY LOUD BUT THEN NEITHER IS MY NOOK.

I think that the only reason people receive these so quickly is because the seller wants to get rid of them before you read the real reviews and change your mind.  I would never purchase any product from this seller again..  Save your money and get something that costs a little more.  I received mine, charged it up as  prompted in the extremely poor english(chinese) instructions I have had the misfortune to read.  After charging the tablet up, I was happy to see it get past the ANDROID screen to the home screen.  Once it got to the home screen it progressively went downhill.  The touch pad doesn't work, so I can't do anything with the tablet.  I can't even shut it off.  I followed the aforementioned instructions to reset the tablet, but I got the same result.  There is no customer support.  The tablet ships out of California, but you can't return it there. you have to return it to China at your expense, with no idea if you will receive your money back or a new tablet.  I have purchased tablets from manufacturers that are based in the US, so maybe I am expecting too much.  If you do purchase this tablet I wish you the best of luck.  I am surprised that AMAZON still has this seller on it's site.", "Date": "July 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "nice tablet", "Author": "ANGEL M CRUZ", "ReviewID": "R15X3J5JLS38QM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "good for the price perfect for kids . . . . . . . . . . . . .", "Date": "February 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "My daughter loves it", "Author": "Steve Tempe", "ReviewID": "R3AD66I7WHU1IF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This tablet does everything my daughter wants to do with it.

My budget was tight, so I was willing to take a chance on an unknown product.  It works well, responsive sensitive screen, that is a little too narrow for the length, but still is crisp to read from or see a movie off of netflix which works pretty well.  Oddly the wifi never shows more than 4 bars even standing right next to the router, but, it had no trouble connecting to my home wifi network.Some caveats:  There is no GPS chip, or rear facing camera. The system labels the interior memory as sdcard, and the external card as extsdcard.  This causes some trouble with some apps where you can not directly download to the exterior card.  Haven't figured out a work around for this yet, but it isn't a major problem yet.  Additionally, there isn't much support information on this tablet, so you need to be a good DIY user.
