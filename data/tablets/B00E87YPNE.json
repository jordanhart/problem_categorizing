I didn't think it would work too good because of the low price, but it works great. Its fast and enjoyable. I see some people say its slow as dialup. I have wireless internet on my laptop so I just turn my tablet on and it did everything else. You got to have wireless internet to do that. I see now that its even cheaper for what I paid for it. I only paid 83and its great.
