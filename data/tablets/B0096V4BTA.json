But....", "Author": "Reviewer MHM 3-5 \"Reviewer 3-5\"", "ReviewID": "R2EA7BYN2H89P0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I would love to give this device a five star rating. I really would. It's a brilliant device. It is the perfect size for an iPad. It fits comfortably in my hand, and yes, i can even fit it in my pockets still (but I'm a 6' 4\" guy so ladies don't expect the same) The keyboard I type this review with on screen is perfect for typing with thumbs. No need to stretch at all, but the buttons aren't like the iPod or iPhone where if you're not careful you'll mistype frequently. The screen resolution is gorgeous, and I love using this as my contact book and planner. Web browsing is very fast but here's where we come to the issue.If you do a search on Google and Apple forums, you will find a lot of complaints that the iPad Mini won't stay connected to WiFi. The iOS 6.0.2 update was supposed to fix this, but it has not. I find my iPad will connect to the router just fine, but it won't always connect to the Internet. I can have three bars of WiFi reception and still not be able to pull up a web page, use my apps, etc. I have found one person who said he solved this by manually inputting the router data, but I still need to try this. More likely I'm hoping that the first batch of these iPads were \"lemons\" so to speak and I'll go to the Apple Store and try to exchange it. I haven't had this device for even a week so hopefully they'll allow me to do so.I am thinking sometime down the road Apple will patch this. But until they do, I simply can't give it the Five Star review I want to give it. I will update this if I find a solution. If those of you Amazon users find a solution, please let me know with comments!", "Date": "January 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Is iPad mini a worthy purchase? Read on to find out!", "Author": "Ah Pui", "ReviewID": "R2PUSUP94CZ3N3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like some of us, I bought my iPad 3 early this year and really enjoyed it. The entertainment values coupled with the productivities boost make iPad a worthwhile purchase. For iPad mini however, the competitors are real and decisions are harder than ever before. It maybe the most promising tablet of today but does it deserve your hard earned cash?Below is my observations after using it for some time:-perfect form factor. Feather weight, incredibly thin yet feel substantial.-good for games that require lots of maneuverability.-huge number of existing high quality iPad apps available for iPad mini.-most ideal ebook reader period.-act as a portable digital album with enough real estate for detail showcasing.-perfect for work use. Much lighter to carry and pass around showing demos etc.-less awkward for camera use.-less awkward to pull out in the middle of a bus ride and watch a movie.-sustain much longer period of holding without hand straining.-one hand holding. not quite one hand usage but feels great to be able to hold comfortably in one hand.-bring everywhere, use anywhere. almost pocket sized and serve well as nightstand and desk accessory (alarm clock, desk weather display etc).-perfect travel companion. ultra long battery life. easy to pack, carry and use at all times.-perfect notetaker/notepad. In meetings/conferences, easy to carry around and write on.-perfect for children. it may be mini but the most ideal iPad in terms of size and weight for them.minor negatives:-would prefer bigger screen for mindless browsing.-retina hd for video playback won't hurt.-easier to mistype in portrait mode.-some games just look better on the bigger iPad.-Apple may screw us by releasing a retina display iPad mini with the same price early next year.-not an inexpensive tablet. Costs almost the same as a slightly used iPad 3.-complements but does not completely replace the iPad. May need to carry both in same cases.So who should rush out and buy iPad mini now? Road warriors and avid book readers will most benefit from the perfectly sized iPad mini. It weights only 10.88 oz (0.68 pound) which is at least 10% lighter than the nearest 7\" competitor (nexus 7), not to mention much thinner (a ridiculous 30% thinner) and with a larger screen to boost! the most current iPad with its 1.44 pounds, is more than double the weight of mini which maybe significant if you are holding and carrying it all day. gamers may be slightly disappointed since it is equipped with the old A5 processor chip and the non-retina display (1024 x 768) is less than ideal when compared with the current retina (2048 x 1536) iPad. However, the screen resolution is very much comparable to its current 7\" competitors where 1280 x 800 pixels is the norm. But keep in mind that the iPad mini processor (dual core 1.0 Ghz 512mb RAM) is the weakest among its peers (nexus 7 quad core 1.2 GHz 1GB RAM, kindle hd dual core 1.2 GHz 1GB RAM). I doubt any one will notice the difference but performance geeks may beg to differ.I am also a bit disappointed that the iPad mini with its much smaller size and lower screen resolution, does not have significantly better battery life compared to its bigger sibling. I was also hoping to see a micro usb and hdmi port, but that didn't materialize.Photographers rejoice! With its perfect size, we can finally find reasons to use iPad mini as a camera as well. Its 5 MP rear camera resolution is adequate for taking casual pictures as it has the same resolution as its more expensive sibling. Shooting 1080p videos is also supported which is great. It feels really comfortable holding the iPad mini for shooting videos given its ample screen size in an ultra lightweight package. iPad mini beats out all its closest competitors, including google nexus 7 and kindle hd as they have 0 MP. they don't come with rear facing camera at all! Unfortunately wifi-only iPad mini does not come with GPS, otherwise Garmin, watch out! It would have make a perfect portable navigation system. Its the one area where nexus 7 has an edge as it has both NFC and GPS built in. NFC (Near field Communication) is an amazing piece of technology that allows us to use our mobile device as credit card payments and even transferring of data or images to other NFC-enabled devices just by touching. I hope Apple can consider adding this to their future products as this would make iPad mini even more awesome. iPad mini however has a 64 GB storage option (which I recommend) and 4G LTE connectivity option which are not available among its rivals. Mini tablets cross shoppers may also find the iPad mini physical appearance much more appealing. While kindle hd and nexus 7 do feel good in my hands, iPad mini feels even better as the build quality is undeniably more superior. Who doesn't like the sexy unibody aluminum build? The huge library of available iPad apps is also a deciding factor since only a fraction of android apps are designed for tablet use. There is no objective way to measure it, but I just found Apple iOS more user friendly than the android so it maybe more appealing to broader audiences.Now come the most interesting part. iPad mini maybe all great, but does it justify the premium? more specifically, should we pay an extra $130 for it? after all, 7\" kindle fire hd and nexus 7 come at $199 whereas iPad mini is listed at the $329 starting price. to make things harder, is iPad mini too expensive even compared to the new iPad which comes listed at $499 which btw is only 52% more expensive with significantly better specs. With mini tablets especially, physical properties are extremely important. 10% lighter and 30% thinner coupled with 35% more viewing area compared to its 7\" rivals, iPad mini scores huge points in this area. Apple iOS ecosystem with its huge library of high quality iPad apps may add some bonus points as well. All these makes paying an extra $130 worth it. Assuming similar depreciation of 35% like the iPad 3 after 8 months, savvy shoppers who could afford to wait, can get an absolute steal at $215, which is very much comparable to its rivals prices. Comparing iPad mini and iPad is much harder since the new iPad is significantly more powerful with a much larger screen and weight. I would think they target slightly different market and each complements  the other quite well without cannibalizing each other. However, if a retina display iPad mini ever comes out, I won't be surprised if more people choose it over iPad as their only tablet.For people considering trading in their iPad 3 for a mini, a significant drop in text quality may have to be expected. There is no noticeable differences to me while browsing images, however while reading large blocks of text, the drop in text quality is quite pronounced. Text appeared to be fuzzy and less crisp (especially in foreign characters where each character has more strokes), when compared to the razor sharp and clear text in retina display. For me personally, it is a tradeoff I am willing to make for extreme portability with almost identical features.Some people may criticize Apple for essentially releasing the same product year after year, just in slightly different form (may go as far as the original iPod). They are completely missing the point. People just have totally different feelings and emotions, and most certainly unique experiences interacting with different variances of the product. I certainly have as much fun playing with my iPod touch as my iPad mini. I can't wait to hear stories about how people interacted with their mini in ways they haven't done it before. I am sure we can always find novel creative ways to expand the use case scenarios for our beloved iPad mini.Besides practical reasons to owning it, there are aesthetics reasons too. iPad mini is just so beautiful to look at as it is indeed a piece of engineering marvel. I see iPad mini as the perfect travel entertainment device where as iPad is the perfect home entertainment device. Happy hunting!", "Date": "November 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perfect iPad for my family and I", "Author": "David Perez", "ReviewID": "RR4RP1OIUXXIS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the 32gb LTE version and I am VERY satisfied with my purchase. I have the iPad 4, but wanted something smaller that was a bit more portable for traveling. I am so glad I made this purchase as it met my needs with overwhelming excitement. First, the size makes it feel easier to use for day-to-day activities such as web surfing and checking email. While I can do this with the iPad 4, the mini makes the user experience greater as there is less to tote around and is much much lighter than the iPad 4. After holding the iPad 4 for 30 minutes, it begins to feel like a brick. Holding the mini for 30 minutes doesn't even begin to tire out each of your arms from holding it for almost any period of time.Regarding the screen, it shows beautiful vibrant colors compared to the latest-gen iPad's. Owning both and comparing them side-by-side, I cannot tell the difference in quality while watching the same content on each of the units simultaneously. While I'm sure \"retina display\" is better in one way or another, it's hard to discern with the human eye as to the visual difference between the two. It's like comparing a 720p and a 1080p TV at 10 feet away - both look the same in regards to picture quality because the human eye cannot see the difference. For those that can \"see\" a difference, you must be holding the unit extremely close to your face (closer than just reading distance) or the \"retina display is better\" claim has tricked your mind into thinking you're seeing something that's simply not there. All of my family, including my young children, cannot tell the difference when watching movies or reading text. Even the content on my iPhone 5 seems a bit fuzzy, however when I pinch and zoom, it all goes away. The same is true of my iPad 4 which relates to the iPad mini. Don't let anyone fool you, the picture is gorgeous.As far as the LTE is concerned, it's lightning fast, however it will depend on your area. I can connect at 32mbps down and 9.5 mbps up in my area which is faster than my home broadband connection. I have no trouble hooking up to LTE and I always have a constant signal around my city. In addition, I have zero problems connecting to any wifi source. Here's the link to my screen capture from Speed Test: [...] I have a an iPad 2, iPad 4, iPhone 5's and the iPad mini. Across all platforms, the performance is fantastic albeit the performance on the iPad 2 is much slower in comparison to the mini, even though it has the same processor. My test is Sky Gamblers which plays a bit choppy on my iPad 2, but plays exactly the same as on my iPad 4 with an A6X processor.I added an Otterbox case and it nearly doubled the size of the unit. But WAIT!!!! This is a GOOD thing. It makes the iPad feel extremely comfortable in your hand and you will not lose grip as you may with the unit by itself since it's so thin and sleek. I have Otterbox Defender cases on all of my products mentioned above and swear by them. They are the best investment I've made in regards to accessories.In conclusion, this is one helluva product and I'm glad I purchased it. Do NOT be discouraged by the \"retina display\" hoopla that makes it seems as this is an inferior iPad. It's not in any way, shape or form. Using an iPad 4 to compare performance, the iPad mini mimics the exact performance that the iPad does, for the exception of programs opening about a half-second slower. I can definitely live with that.

I paid just as much for it as I would have directly from apple, so I was not expecting any troubles. Unfortunately, this was not the case. I turn my new iPad mini on and the screen immediately begins flickering and has white streaks through the screen. Garbage. Absolute garbage. Also, this store is unable to do exchanges through amazon, so in order for me to get a working iPad, I now have to take the time to mail the defective one back, wait for the money to be put back on my account, and then place another order (from a different store obviously). I am extremely disappointed.", "Date": "October 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Coming from Android, geek perspective.", "Author": "Y. Zhou", "ReviewID": "R3ACF2HMPTS97M", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "HiBefore I give you the review, let me tell you about my background. I am a college student who is very into tech. I've owned many tablets, and even more phones. I buy them used and sell them used, so I swap between a lot of devices. It's a bad habit, I know, but I really want to find that perfect device.Tablets I've owned:-iPad 1,2,3-Galaxy Tab 10.1-Nexus 7 (2012)I bought the iPad mini because I recently bought an iPhone 5 (from Nexus 4) to compliment my Macbook Air. I always went with Android devices because of how cheap they were, but I decided to splurge on an iOS/Mac ecosystem and see how well they sync together. I chose the iPad Mini because I think that the original iPads are too big. Also I like how thin the bezels are for the mini.So now you know why I bought the mini, here are my list of Pros and Cons.PROS:- Display. Yes I know, it's not retina, but it is still an IPS display. I would take an IPS display with 720p over any other display with 1080p. It's vibrant, colors are sharp. A retina would make it even better, but for me it's not that big of a deal.- Size and weight. So slim and light it's sexy. This is the main reason I picked this Mini over and iPad with retina. All the old iPads I've used, I never find myself using them often because it's tiring to hold them up for anything longer than a few minutes. WIth the mini, it's much easier.- Build quality. The main reason I've always envied apple users, their products are always such beauties.- iPad specific apps. Android tablet apps are just scaled up versions of phone apps, which makes the experience very dull. On the iPad, many apps have iPad versions, which uses the screen real-estate much better.- Internet. Browsing the web in safari is much better experience than on an Android tablet. It's faster, smoother, and everything just fits on the screen.CONS:iTunes. The lack of file management in iOS. This is the MAIN reason I'm having such a frustrating time on the iPad.  I like my iPhone, but dislike the iPad because of iTunes. It boils down to what I do on my iPhone vs what I do on my iPad. On the iPhone, I generally use it to go online, call/text, take pics, siri, youtube, email, etc. Very common stuff. On the iPad however, all I really do is read ebooks and watch videos. Given that, the reason I dislike the iPad is that it relies on iTunes way too much. I can't simply drag and drop video/ebook files into the ipad like I can do with any android device, I have to sync through iTunes. That itself is not that big of a deal, EXCEPT that iTunes only recognizes SOME of the very common files. For example, I have a lot of TV series saved on my Computer. Mostly all TV series files and some movie files are in AVI format, which is an extremely common video file type, but iTunes does not support it. If I wanted to get those files onto  my iPad, I'd have to convert the entire collection from AVI to MP4 individually, then drag them into iTunes, then sync it up with my iPad.Lightning. It's rare, and very expensive. Basically all the microUSB chargers I have are useless now. Not many people have the new 8pin lightning cords lying around, so you're SOL if you go out without your cord and your iPad dies on you. With android devices, there are microUSBs all over my house and in my car, so do most of my friends, so it's no worry. Also the lightning cords are very expensive. Often $20+. MicroUSBs, on the other hand, is often less than $2. The only clear advantage I can see of owning a lightning is that you can plug it in any side you want...big whoop.Lack of stereo speakers. Since I watch videos on it all the time, I wished it had stereo speakers like the Nexus 10 and the new Nexus 7.CONCLUSION:So there's my reasons. I am not a fanboy of android nor apple, they both have their pros and cons. The iPad is still the best tablet to browse the web for, which is probably what a lot of you will do. But if you're like me and sees yourself watching videos on it and reading ebooks, and has a huge library saved in your computer, then you might want to get an android tablet.", "Date": "July 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly of the iPad Mini", "Author": "Jeremy Floyd", "ReviewID": "R2JD6ORJRM14S0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Whether this is your first iPad or a replacement to an aging iPad, then you should consider the good, bad and the ugly before adding to your cart. I replaced a 32GB 1G iPad with a 32GB wi-fi mini. So, of course, the mini adds some features right off the bat that make it a major improvement over the 1G, but most importantly, this device travels with me more often than my previous iPad ever did.The GoodThe size! The mini seems perfectly designed for two thumb typing. Even with split-screen dock keyboard, I always found the on-screen keyboard to be cumbersome and difficult.Siri on the iPad is quite convenient as a desktop accessory and a mobile feature.The BadWhen compared side by side with Samsung or the Amazon Fire HD, the device doesn't stack up with display, audio, and peripheral input. This is the bad that everyone points to and there are some features lacking (some of which will not be resolved in future versions).The lightning connector - having apple devices for over a decade has many 30-pin connectors laying around the house. Now we have to lightning connectors in the house, so they are in hot demand. The connector doesn't always fit firmly, so sometimes I check the device to a disappointing 16% charge.The UglyThe display doesn't bother me as much as others, but the lack of retina display has bothered a number of owners. Of course this will be resolved soon.In the end, I would buy it again, and I don't have any regrets knowing that improved features are on the way.", "Date": "January 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "AMAZING! 4.5 STARS", "Author": "Margaux Paschke", "ReviewID": "R3AB1PD2PV51H7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a very non-technical review -- the newest version of the iPad rocks with its portability. This iPad mini easily slips into a purse or jacket pocket making it easy to carry around for either a female or male. You get all of the perks of the regular iPad with the extra benefit of being able to carry it around with you everywhere. Simply amazing!I love my iPad and use it more than any other electronic devise but I mourned its lack of portability. The iPad's size is great for watching tv, movies, reading books or light document work but a hassle to carry around. I had to dig out my huge purse to carry it around anywhere and the weight and size was cumbersome. This iPad mini is slimmer, lighter and smaller and oh so convenient to take with me when I leave the house.The smaller size does impact my document usage but since I use it mostly for entertainment, this is really minor for me but will affect those who use the iPad for work. I keep hearing the iPad mini lacks the same power (slower processor) as the iPad but I don't feel it. I've played games on it, watched videos, etc. without any noticeable difference. Maybe power is an issue with heavy document usage? I did deduct a half star for the lower screen resolution than the newest iPad while keeping the price tag around $350. Seriously?  The lower resolution is not so much apparent on iTunes purchases but more visible on home video or other sourced digital media.How does Apple seduce me into wanting their newest product (although, I'm proud so say I avoided their siren's call for the iPhone 5) and after using it, making it the newest best thing I cannot live without? Husband says it makes the regular iPad positively clunky and almost archaic but I think it's more sinister - it makes me appreciate the iPad for home use and the iPad mini for away-from-home use. Great, now I've used up my gift allowance for all of 2013....but you won't find me complaining this Christmas, birthday or anniversary because the iPad mini is worth it!Overall, if you can splurge this is the one thing you really want to spend your money on.

Better screen, cheaper, etc. after I went to best buy and actually played around with the fire, I hated it. It was bulky and seemed old, you couldn't even take pictures on it! Later, I was at the apple store with my sister while she got her iPhone 5 fixed, and I picked up the mini for the first time. Not only does it feel much more classy and expensive, it was thinner, lighter, and had a perfect screen size. The keyboard is so easy to type on, I'm actually using it right now. When I am using it in public I get a lot of comments because some people haven't seen it yet! When I use iPads they seem so bulky now, I love that the mini uses more screen size on the front and doesn't waste space like the full size ipad! I use the mini basically every moment of the day unless I'm working or with friends. At school, I took notes on it and I am excited to save money on text books next year, the ebooks are cheap and look great! Everyone complains about the screen resolution, but honestly I can't tell the difference, I think it looks the same as my retina I touch. I've never been more happy with a purchase.

This will be probably considered biased, being that I have way too many Apple products to count (iMacs, macbooks, mac mini, iphones, ipods, ipads etc..) so if you're not a fan of the truly brilliant company that is Apple, then you probably don't want to read this review.When I first heard of the mini coming out, I thought it was a joke, like really? Isn't that what the iPod touch is for? But when you go and hold this iPad, you truly see the difference between it's brothers and competition, and realize it is a great product in and of itself. The size of the screen is perfect, big enough to enjoy pictures / video, thin and light enough to toss in a bag on the go. I have the big brother New iPad, or iPad 3 or 4, whatever the heck they call it, and this is definitely a great individual product, and not just a scale down.I do have an Kindle Fire HD 7\" and the iPad Mini is wider and longer, so the screen is a bit bigger. It looks great, feels great in your hands, even though I would recommend a case for it to add some girth, because even though it does feel great naked, it just seems way too easy to drop and slip out of your hands.What more can I really say? Quick surfing, mail, chatting, pictures, video, magazines, books, this is a great addition to whatever gadget arsenal you have. I have always stood behind Apple products and can't preach enough how great they are, how easily integrated all their products are together and so on.

If you want to know the honest description of this product, hopefully this will help you.I bought this product at the apple store the day it was released, and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND buying this product from apple, that is if you want to save money. Otherwise there is no point in buying this product from amazon unless you are one of those people that wants to spend an extra 80 bucks. From the apple store, the 16 gig iPad mini is 330$, while the same product sells for 417$ on amazon.Simply, this is the product for a person that wants to take a tablet places and needs to slip it in there handbag without a second thought. If you want a more enhanced display and a larger body, buy the iPad with retina display.This product is definitely better than the iPad 2. It is lighter, faster, has a much better display, streams clearer photos, is much lighter and more portable, although the iPad 2 is a wonderful product. And if you are searching for a tablet for yourself, or a tablet for others, and are considering other brands, please, I could spend five pages of facts that would prove the iPad mini a far more advanced tablet than anything out there. This tablet is so much more smooth, sleek, fast, and has such a better camera, there aren't even words to describe the difference. Yes, the price is heigh, but so worth it. I am 13 and I researched all different types of products and brands and I chose this, and it was a worth while decision. I paid every penney for this product and I do not regret it! This tablet is excellent for social networking. Because of the brilliant I sight camera I can snap a photo of anything, anywhere, and double tap the image, and post. Everything is simplified on such a sleek device.Now, for the cons, I will say there is one thing: if you were like me, and looked at all the videos and documentation a they show you, almost all the apps, books, movies and music costs money, so all of the special features cost extra.

I am by no means an apple fanatic, I traded my iPhone 4 for a Galaxy Nexus and never looked back. However, the tablet ecosystem is much different than smartphones right now. I find myself using the iPad mini almost always over my phone now, aside from texting and calling. Here's my list of pros and cons:Pros:Fantastically smooth- seriously. You really don't need to compare android tablet specs with iPad's. The iPad will always have a lower clock speed and less ram, yet somehow perform beautifully and rarely have a hiccup. This has a dual core 1ghz, and my phone has a dual 1.2ghz. Yet, the iPad rarely skips a beat, while I have to occasionally kill apps or reboot my phone to keep its performance smooth.Battery is fantastic- I use this thing a LOT. Like, a few hours throughout the day. I blast music on the speakers, surf the web, tumblr, facebook, flipboard. Yet I only have to charge it maybe once every other day. I've played a half hour of music from the (also fantastic) speakers, and the battery moved 1%. It's great.The speakers are rich and loud as hell- I often used my roomie's laptop before I bought the ipad, and it worked. Now I have to use my ipad to listen to music, simply because it's louder and richer than the laptop speakers. And it's not a netbook, it's a standard 15.4 incher. The iPad mini is LOUD, in stereo. The bass even rocks. It's not extremely prominent, but it's a step up from the tinny wannabe bass from this laptop or my phone.Extremely easy to jailbreak- for the tinkerers out there. I love to tinker, thus the android phone I own. But with evasi0n jailbreak, you literally plug the iPad into the computer, hit a button, 5 minutes later, jailbroken.Slim, sleek, and light- This thing is a feat of technology, reminiscent of the first iPod nano. It just makes you think, how the hell did they fit all that into this tiny case? Holding the ipad mini for extended periods proves to be comfortable and painless, and it literally just slides into my backpack effortlessly when I'm traveling. I never wanted an iPad before, simply because they were too big, and 7 inch tablets were too narrow and small. This ipad gets it right.iPad specific apps- This is a big point in the android vs iPad wars. Android tablets are generally cheaper than iPads, with faster and higher capacity internals. On paper, they win over the iPad in every way. But where the iPad really outshines them is the apps. Many 7 inch android tablet apps are just scaled-up versions of their phone counterparts. But the iPad, being popular as it is, has developers writing entirely new versions of their apps specifically for the larger tab. And they look great. They're functional, convenient, and reliable. Apps like flipboard, youtube, and tumblr come to mind. Whereas on a Nexus 7, these apps are just scaled up (10 inch tabs get a tablet version of youtube, which is actually pretty cool though).UI (user interface)- Apple is known for taking simplicity and perfecting it for the masses. The iPad's UI is the pinnacle of their design. It just works, and it works well. Apps are organized in a 4x5 grid, with room for 6 on the dock at the bottom. The notification bar pulls down from the top just as it has since iOS5, and holding the home buttom gives you a nice greeting from siri. But the multitouch gestures are really where it shines. 4 fingers swiped up opens the multitasking bar. While in an app, 4 fingers swiped side to side switches between other open apps. And my favorite, 5 fingers pinched in at any point takes you back to the home screen. I had always griped about having to hit the physical home button, and this solves that issue. Also, swiping to the left of the multitasking bar gets you to quick settings, such as music control, brightness, volume, and orientation lock. Nifty.Cons:The non-retina display- Honestly, I think the only reason this bothers me is because my phone has a 720p HD display, which is becoming the norm these days, with high end phones getting 1080p this year. The screen isn't bad, it's bright and colorful. It's just not extremely crisp. It's especially noticeable when reading smaller text. I'm sure later this year Apple will find a way to cram a retina display in, and maybe I'll upgrade. But probably not, because it's honestly not that big of a deal in everyday use. The device is still an extreme pleasure to use. And this is my only con.Overall, I'd highly recommend the mini. It's a great tweener for the iPhone and full sized iPad. It's become my go-to device, and I really enjoy using it everyday. If you have the extra capital and are in the market for a reliable, responsive tablet, go for the iPad mini.", "Date": "March 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best tablet I've used so far...comes with a few cons though", "Author": "casper", "ReviewID": "R106Y8MK1Q0AUH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Everyone else already covered the essential characteristics, features and functions of the ipad mini, so instead, I'd approach this review on a practicality basis to let you know how it works for me.Things I'd like to touch on are non retina, slower A5 processor, screen size, and physical build qualityLACK OF RETINA DISPLAYI've seen countless reviews of people complaining that the non retina display on the ipad mini is a pain to use and the fuzziness of texts is unbearable to read ...well...it's not!!!!! Yes the ipad mini screen display could've been a lot better and sharper than it currently is but to be honest, I think users of iPhone 4/4s/5, ipad3/4, and all other iDevices that currently use retina screens are just spoiled by being accustom to apple having retina that they have a state of mind that they won't accept anything less than retina quality from apple.A lot of other mobile companies have screens a lot worse than retina but yet still people accept it mainly because their expectations for the other brands aren't as high as what they'd expect from apple...people love the non retina MacBook Pros...and reading texts on that machine isn't a pain or unbearable right?I'd love to see retina on the next releases of the new ipad minis schedules for later this year but in the mean while, I'm pretty satisfied with the existing display...it's not great, but it's also far from being bad.A5 PROCESSORThis is the reason I took away 1 star from making this product earn a 5 star review....the major blow to me of this device is that it has an A5 processor and not that it lacks a retina display...for those who are unaware, the A5 chip comes with built in RAM which only has the capacity of 512mb...doing basic things on the ipad mini doesn't require an A5x or aA6 chip but with the more intense apps like Waze, graphic intense games, and even Facebook, you'd begin to experience some slow downs on your device...again, not unbearable, but definitely not a smooth experience as one would like.Is it a dealbreaker? If I'm relying on just specs on paper, then YES....however, if I'm basing my purchase of an ipad mini on actual use of the device forgetting specs and just seeing how the device works in real life situations...then NO...although the ipad mini only has 512mb of RAM it's not a slouch. iOS is very hardware efficient and you won't feel the lack of 1gb RAM on iOS as much as you would on an android device running jelly bean for example.SCREEN SIZEthis is honestly the best screen size I've experienced on any tablet thus far. You can easily type with both thumbs while holding the ipad mini in portrait mode (something that wasn't possible with the classic sized iPads unless you split the keyboard).A 7.9\" screen is a joy to carry around as its not too large and not too small neither. My sentiments are that 7\" is a little too small for a tablet as they're phones already close to that size such as the galaxy note series. At first I wasn't too sure how I'd feel about the extra .9 of an inch thinking to myself that it's not a significant amount of extra real estate to satisfy me seeing as I previously owned an ipad 3, but to my suprise, it's just the right size for my personal taste.I know you probably heard this countless times before but I too think that this should've been the size of the iPads all along as now that I own a mini, I'd never go back to that 9.7\" of the classic iPads...I find myself carrying around and using my ipad mini a lot more than I did with my ipad 3 even though it was faster and had a better display....this ipad mini simply is what a tablet is supposed to be....PORTABLE!!!PHYSICAL BUILD QUALITYThe ipad mini is a wonderful piece of hardware. Detail given by apple in the production of this machine is simply amazing. From the moment you hold it in your hands you'd feel the love and great R&D; they put into this device. It does come with a few drawbacks but the pros by far outnumbers the cons.It is the nicest lookin ipad yet, best screen size in my opinion, best with regards to portability and it does everything it's bigger brothers do, a bit slower, but in real time it's only a few milliseconds slower though which to me is not substantial.Next gen ipad mini with a faster processor and retina screen WILL be the best ipad you can possibly get, but for now I'm pretty satisfied with the ipad mini and can safely recommend this device to anyone looking for an excellent, lightweight and portable tablet", "Date": "May 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "iPad Mini was advertised as new but it was used and defective", "Author": "Kym", "ReviewID": "R1OZFVNHQMAS1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I placed an order for the iPad Mini 64 GB WIFI.

True, it looks sharper than the iPad 2 at first glance, because the pixels are spread over a considerably smaller screen, but still, when you hold it close at reading distance, you can see the pixels, and the Retina Displays on the other iPads have conditioned me to expect NO pixellation - just sharp, sharp viewing even with nose almost on the screen. If sharper viewing is what you want in a 7\" tablet, you will have to get the Google Nexus 7 or the Kindle HD Fire - Displaymate, which specializes in monitor calibration and reviews, grades both of those competitors higher than the iPad mini. (I will post the link to the Displaymate review in \"Comments.\")But neither the Nexus 7 nor the Kindle HD Fire has perfected the overall \"user experience\" like Apple, or has so many useful, and highly-tuned, Apps.Also, iPad minis are flying off the shelves. Most adults are buying minis for themselve, but a sizeable chunk, like me, are buying them for their kids since they only cost $29 more than the iPod Touch, the previous kids' favorite.Why, if the mini is just shy of perfection and we know (strongly suspect?) that Apple will, indeed, introduce a Retina Display mini next year, is it nevertheless such a big hit this year?Well, first of all, you have to hold it to believe it. It just feels so _right_. The mini is remarkably thin, just like the new iPhone 5 and new iPod Touch (5th gen). This slimness translates into really light weight, and the more squared edges translate into much easier holding. It is considerably bigger, in terms of surface area, than most other 7\" class tablets, but holds just as comfortably in the hand and makes other 7\" class tablets feel clunky and cheap in comparisonApple favored the books and web browsing experiences over movie/tv viewing. The screen is close to 4:3, so 16:9 movies/tv end up being letterboxed. But since the Apple has more square inches of viewing surface than other 7\" class tablets to begin with (the Apple is actually 7.85\" on the diagonal), the net resulting picture is about the same actual size as the \"full screen\" version on other 7\" class tablets.The smaller size with much lighter weight totally changes the viewing/reading experience. Hold it in one hand while you lie in bed and your wrist doesn't feel strained from the weight of a full-sized iPad. With two hands you can view or read for hours, just like on an e-reader.If this had a Retina Display, I'd give it 5 stars, and wish I could give it 6 or 7, it's THAT good.For kids (who read a lot less, and play games a lot more), this IS 5 star, right out of the box. An amazing 10-13 hours of battery life; a good screen, the Apple App universe. It is MUCH better proportioned for kids' smaller hands than the full-sized iPad (which probably feels to their hands like a 12.5\" would feel to us).In terms of hardware, this has the same zippy processor as the iPad 2, but a vastly upgraded camera on both the front and back. The front is now HD FaceTime, the back is 5 megapixels with autofocus (but no flash). It has SIRI. It has 16gb, which should be fine for a lot of \"fat\" video games; the $299 iPod Touch has 32gb, but that is positioned more as a portable media player with emphasis on \"music.\"My 8 y.o. daughter uses this to watch Netflix, watch Amazon Instant Video, do dental surgery (there is a kids App for that? good grief and shades of Little Shop of Horrors!), practice foreign languages, etc., etc., etc. Formerly she borrowed her mom's iPad 2, but she much prefers this, though I can't tell whether that is because it's her \"own\" or because it works better (but she didn't complain that I didn't get her an iPad 2, and that would have cost the same price - iPad 2's were discounted this season, while minis were not).There is a lot of speculation about why Apple didn't come out with a Retina Display on this one out of the box. Here are my thoughts:1. Apple sold a LOT of original iPads and iPad 2s and there wasn't really \"consumer demand\" for the Retina Display on the iPad 3. This was more a technology \"push\" from Apple than a \"must have\" from consumers. As more e-readers transfer their allegiance from reflective \"e-ink\" e-readers to tv-screen style tablets, though, Retina Display or its equivalent is more and more of a \"must have.\"2. Current Retina Display technology on larger devices - above the size of iPhones - calls for really, really bright LED's behind the screen - the \"aperture\" or \"tiny window\" for the pixel is so small on the larger Retina Display screens that you need a stronger light to illuminate it (the transistors have to fit in the same \"cell\" as the display pixel, which is why the \"aperture\" is relatively as well as absolutely smaller). So you need more lights, or larger lights, PLUS a bigger battery to generate all that light. This is why the iPad 3, and even the iPad 4, got heavier, fatter, and ran hotter than the slimmer, cooler iPad 2.- Now there seems to be new screen technology emerging that might solve some of these problems, but apparently the \"yield\" (usable to unusable percentage of production) is very low on the larger versions of these screens (and Apple apparently has a screen shortage even on the lower-tech iPad mini screen).3. In terms of actual usage patterns, some reviewers are reporting they prefer the smaller, lighter iPad mini over the sharper, but larger and heavier, iPad 3 or iPad 4. Yes, they know the screen colors are more accurate on the full-sized iPads, and the screen resolution can't be beat -but what they prefer hauling around is the mini. The mini screen is sharp \"enough.\"4. Early adopters are mostly adults. But based on how my kid has taken to the mini, this is THE computer device the industry has been predicting since the '70's - the computer that will transform education. And, I think, play, at least if you consider it \"transformational\" if kids spend all their game time on a tablet instead of on a Wii or DS etc. Personally, I think there is a real possibility these tablets will change Nintendo into a niche player and drive Sony out of the portable market. I do believe hard-core gamers will stick with  xBox and Playstation, but the market for the mini is potentially much larger than the market for console players. The number of additional kids owning these will more than off-set the number of adults who hold out for a Retina Display. For kids - this is perfect, as is.I am completely fussy, and even I am tempted by the mini. As much as I KNOW Apple will solve the technological and size and weight problems with a mini Retina Display in the near future - in less than a year - I still would like to have one now, because it is so easy to hold and use. I want my kid's iPad mini in a way I NEVER wanted my wife's iPad 2 (I actually preferred the Touch to the iPad 2). It is THE ideal sized cafe/travel tablet/reader, and after spending many, many hours with Android (4.0, 4.1, 4.2) on the MUCH better priced Nexus 7, I STILL prefer the iPad mini.So I can review this - I \"borrowed\" my kid's mini to do so - but I'm going to fight the good fight to resist getting my own.

The latest generation of Apple products has really brought production quality to a new level. The mini is ridiculously thin and light, build quality on this is a generation or two ahead of the the iPad retina. This is one of those products you really need to pick up and handle to really appreciate.The display is not retina quality, but it's easily better than the iPad 1 or the iPad 2. Colors are good and brightness is good. I really like that they were able to shrink the bevels on the sides, it keeps the mini portable enough to slide in your pocket in a pinch. It's not comfortable in the back pocket of your jeans, but it fits there for short trips or if you need a hand in a hurry.I haven't pushed performance enough yet so it's hard to say where it sets with regards to that. Trying out a few videos I didn't notice any lag or missed frames and the actual UI is smooth and responsive. Because it's screen is lower resolution, you can still play iPad games on it with a good frame rate.Sound is surprisingly good and loud for a product this size. The only downsize to the sound is the fact that the stereo speakers are placed near each other on one of the narrow sides of the device. In cinema/ landscape orientation, the sound is on one side or the other. Even in portrait orientation, the stereo effect is not great. I tend to listen using headphones so I'm not sure it's a huge issue. It's a 3.5 star sound system, great sound, but frustrating placement.The lightning adaptor is a nice upgrade. You do lose access to older accessories, but it's quicker to use than the 30 pin adaptor (or microUSB, but that's another story). Charging is fast, 30 minutes to top it off which is awesome.------Update ------After a few weeks of use, I've only grown to like this more. It's so small, it's easy to tote along everywhere. I've been doing some photo editing on it and it works fairly well, but sometimes when you are trying complex edits or trying to undo a bunch of things in a row there is a bit of lag.

It has just not excited me.  It's really not that the 1024x768 resolution is bad, after all, with a smaller screen size, the pixel density increases slightly, but its certainly discernible from the retina display of the new iPads.I just find that the form factor is not so significantly different that I'm amazed and delighted by how much I can do with a smaller device.  Nor am I bowled over by its price.  The stereo speakers are there, but no more noticeably louder than my full-sized iPad with only one speaker.  It's really just there.  In other words, it's more of the same and does not give me the satisfaction of an all-new device.  Now, as I mentioned, I love iOS, and the new betas for iOS 7 will definitely spark some more life into this device, but as I look back and forth between my new, new iPad and my new iPad Mini, all I can do is shrug and say, \"Meh...\"Besides a retina display, what can Apple do to make me espouse the iPad mini as \"magical\"?  It's not hard... I want a louder set of speakers (my wife's 7\" Kindle Fire HD has a booming set of speakers), native apps that not only replace or duplicate the ones on a full size iPad, but rather supplement them so if the two units are together, the functionality increases.  For example, what if any two iPads placed next to each other could extend the screen size?  What if I could place my iPad mini next to my full sized iPad and during Facetime, the iPad mini could show my own face full screen while the large iPad showed the other person's (instead of it being in a little window)?  Finally, they should drop the price by another $50-$75 or, god-forbid, increase the new full sized iPads by $100 to differentiate the price points.Right now, this fanboy is not the world's biggest fan of the iPad mini.  Will I keep it?  Of course, but just until the next one is released.  I have to own each iteration of these devices after all.

One more version, I tell myself... but for the time, I won't recommend an iPad mini if you already own the full-sized iPad.  It's a downgrade.UPDATE: February 2014Now that I also own the iPad Air and Retina iPad Mini, my conclusion is that Apple is starting to fall from grace.  The build quality of the devices continue to be among the industry's very best but innovation seems to have slowed to a near halt.  One more generation of iPhones, iPad and Apple TV for me coming up and if I'm no longer impressed, they will then have lost my business, but more importantly, my brand loyalty.

This is a much better ebook reader than I thought it would be.  In low light situations it is much nicer than a Kindle. The devise is easier to hold with two hands than one. The iPad mini is also great for gaming and watching videos.  I have a larger tablet (10.1) also and this size is just more fun and portable. I accessed my work desktop using Citrix Receiver and it worked great for reading email and other documents and impromptu typing. Sound quality was excellent as usual. The new power connector is easier to plug in. The battery life far exceeds than any other device I own except the Kindle Touch.The things that I thought could use some improvement were few but an annoying few.  WiFi performance is really lacking.  At home, at work and on travel the Wifi is really slow.  App downloads are horribly slow on connections I know to be fast.  I tried connecting at 5G also and it didn't make any improvement. Every once in a while I think the screen jitters.  It would be an artifact from the scree auto-rotating.  I was a little disappointed that it didn't come with some nice Apple earbuds. For the price I would have expected it. The power adapter is yet another Apple-proprietary connector.

I had toyed with getting a Nexus 7, but the Google Play Store just didn't have enough tablet specific apps. I owned an iPhone so I chose to stay within that ecosystem. The app selection for the iPad/iPad Mini is great. The non-retina display is not a concern for me. The display is still very good looking though. The size and weight feel great in your hands and is a great in-between of a smartphone and a laptop. I particularly like the aluminum back. It's cold to the touch when you first start using it, but then adapts to your hand temperature. It's solid hardware and feels very premium.Cons:Speaking of premium, the price. When I bought the iPad Mini in 2012, it was $330 and the processor was already a year behind at that point. The price point as of late 2013 is $299, with the new iPad Mini at a whopping $399. The hundred dollar difference between the 7.9 inch iPad Mini and the 9.7 inch iPad Air makes it difficult to decide. Especially since the new Nexus 7 is only $230 and Amazon Kindle Fire at $139. The processor is still OK, but it can lag on graphic intensive games. If you don't play much of those, you'll be fine. Movies, Youtube, etc all play extremely well.Rating: 5 out of 5.Recommended: Yes.

I have a MacBookPro & an iPhone 4S, 16 GB. A priority for me is having products that do what I want understandably, reliably & w convenient, knowledgable & quick tech support if needed. I have found Apple products are that way so didn't even consider any other brands.I find that the specs for this & the iPhone 4S are somewhat similar--processor, camera, etc & I got the 16 GB version for both.I was using my MacBookPro for business & to show a presentation at the table. But, while very light for a laptop, it still was big to carry around.I find that now I don't even turn on my Mac every day. I can browse email & the web & a lot of apps just fine on it.Since I'm new to the iPad, I wasn't sure just how useful it would be. Well it is. It makes a good e-book reader. Although only have a couple so far. I got the Kindle app since one e-book I wanted needed that format.I also is a very nice size to carry around w me. I got a new purse that is not large but has a pocket on the outside into which the iPad mini in its case just fits.I also like that I can do iMessages on all 3 of my devices & while I can do things on the iPhone, the iPad mini is much easier to read & type on.I bought the Belkin case at BestBuy that looks like a pad folio w snap in holder for the iPad. So its not totally obvious that its an iPad, looks nice & both protects & provides a nice stand for it that works well on table or on my lap.I'm also using my iPad mini rather than a hard cover bible for church, using the YouVersion app. The combo is agile enough to jump around to different passages & easier to carry.As one who is a touch typist, I was concerned about whether I would need an external keyboard, but have found that I can type pretty well on it. Not quite usual fingering--more like several finger typing but have been able to use it to take notes at seminars & meetings. This using the Pages app. I also have purchased the Keynote Ap thinking I would use it, but really use the free Slide Shark to handle a co presentation.  I'm thinking of purchasing the Numbers app. Need to review how to sync the Apple apps between the mini & my Mac.As far as connectors, don't have the myriad of Apple accessories that some are concerned about. I had previously gotten the InCase car charger from the Apple store for my iPhone (after the one I got at Walmart quit working after 8 mo). This is the kind that is in 2 pieces so one plugs into the car power outlet & then any usb plug can plug into it.  So if my iPad Mini needs charging, I can use its cord to plug into the outlet & charge in the car.Also, I bought it at the Apple Store & since I had One to One through my Mac, I could use it to learn my iPhone & my iPad. Unfortunately having recently moved to Portland, OR, the Apple Store is way across town so not as convenient as I was used to. Haven't been there yet. I need to go as sometimes I tap to close a Safari window or click on a link w no response. So should get the touch screen checked (as I did w the touchpad on my previous MacBookPro where they find certain portions not responsive & fixed it, quickly.Speaking of the Apple Store, I like the fact that I have that resource--even though now its less convenient than it was.  This is 1 reason that I like Apple products. If there is an issue,  I remember w other devices (Windows computers & Windows phone) where the service was not very good. My windows phone had major issues (couldn't properly handle daylight savings time & other issues). Verizon people were nice but didn't really help so got runaround & some never did get answers.  They knew a lot of basic stuff, but now w smart phones, they can't know all of them well.Also previously w a device from 1 co & OS from another & then other apps, I have gotten the run around w each blaming the other & being caught between them. Or maybe not even blaming the other but having to make multiple contacts to get an answer.I have found Apple Stores to be on top of things & their service turn around time is very fast--several times faster than they had promised.The other thing w Apple products that I have found is that they just work. I've had hardware & software failures w other computers & phones. I got my iPad Mini I think in early March. Working fine. My iPhone 4S is 22 mo old & working fine (they had to do a reset & upgrade to iOS6 1 time, quickly taken care of at the Apple Store).So for me, having products that do what I want, reliably & w tech support that quickly takes care of any issues that may arise is very important. I had not found that level of reliability & tech support w other products. I expect the same level of continued reliability & service if needed w my iPad Mini.", "Date": "September 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent device", "Author": "A Guy in Indianapolis", "ReviewID": "R3J5LJI5PL2B7Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros: Lightweight but solid-feeling.

The iSight camera takes fantastic photos, and through Photo Stream (enabled on your device) you are able to share up to 1000 photos with others on your network. (Beautiful video quality too!  Get the Action Movie FX app to have a lot of fun posting to Facebook.)  The iPod touch 5th does have the iSight camera too, but a 4\" screen, which for me is a tad small to see and edit photos as I would like to do.The mini's 7.9\" screen size is very functional for 'on the go' email, photo viewing, games and makes reading my Kindle books (free Kindle app available) much more enjoyable.Overall dimensions of the device make it very slim and lightweight, making slipping it into my purse or backpack a breeze.Height:7.87 inches (200 mm)Width:5.3 inches (134.7 mm)Depth:0.28 inch (7.2 mm)Weight:0.68 pound (308 g)The Apple iPad mini pairs easily with Bluetooth devices like keyboards and headsets too.  I don't really see the point in pairing with a keyboard, as with this screen size typing up a term paper is possible - but not likely.  However, pairing with a stereo Bluetooth headset to enjoy a movie or listen to music works really well and makes for fun entertainment during the morning commute. (Assuming you're not driving!)Facetime (720P) works well on the mini, as does emailing - assuming you have a solid Wifi connection; 802.11a/b/g/n Wi-Fi (802.11n 2.4GHz and 5GHz). NOTE: Many apps and functions of all iOS devices, depend upon Wifi to be enabled and to have a solid connection before they will work correctly.Good news for anyone who wants to enjoy this device.Like the iPad, the mini has accessibility features that allow users with disabilities to use the device.  Including...VoiceOver screen readerGuided AccessSupport for playback of closed-captioned contentAssistiveTouch interface for adaptive accessoriesFull-screen zoom magnificationLarge textOption to invert colorsBuilt-in apps get you started enjoying the mini right out of the box, without having to download apps.  They include...Safari - web browser that's fast and has Google set by default.PhotosApp Store - make sure you have your Apple ID ready to grab free and paid apps.Maps - turn on location in settings to use Wifi for directions.Photo BoothReminders - useful for keeping yourself on track.CameraMailFaceTime - a great alternative to Skype.iTunesMusic - sync with your PC or Mac and make sure 'sync' is checked when you do to upload your music to your device.ClockCalendar - integrates with MS Outlook 2010.Messages - send text, voice or photos to others with 'i' devices, and save on cellular data fees!NewsstandVideosGame CenterContacts - use iCloud to store your contacts, messages, emails, photos and do back-ups.  *Free 5GB of iCloud is yours!NotesSECURITY APP TIP: get the free 'Find My iPhone' app (works with iPads too...) and set up a passcode to limit access to your settings so that this app cannot be disabled should your device be stolen or lost.  By using this free app you are able to locate the device (a general area) when it connects to the Internet.  You can also disable the device so that if stolen, it's not going to be 'enjoyed'!Students, commuters, frequent travelers, and gadget lovers will adore the iPad mini for it's highly portable fun and functionality.Those seeking a tablet for working on spreadsheets or writing a novel, go get an iPad instead.iPad mini cases I like...OtterBox Defender Series Hybrid Case for iPad Mini - Black (77-23834) - for those who want extra 'bump' protection!  The only negative to this one is no 'magnetic' sleep function because it doesn't have a cover, it has a built-in screen protector instead.Snugg iPad Mini Leather Case Cover and Flip Stand with Elastic Hand Strap and Premium Nubuck Fibre Interior ('Distressed' Brown) - Automatically Wakes and Puts the iPad Mini to Sleep - fits well, looks good, and has the sleep/wake feature via a magnetic closure.

WOW! Not too big, not too small. Much more functional and portable than the standard 11\" screen iPads. Screen is clear and crisp. Movies look great. Very light weight. Beats every other 7\" category pad hands down. I ordered both this iPad-Mini and the kindle fire HD, and realized the iPad was far superior. Plus you can load all your previous iTunes purchases, including movies, to the iPad mini. If you use iTunes and have purchases thru iTunes, the kindle WILL NOT allow sharing of any of all those iTunes media files. Only the iPad will. Battery last an amazing long time. Much longer than the old 11\" iPad's. Probably because it is smaller and uses less energy? Uses the newer apple plug. Same connector as the iPhone 5. Charges with the same smaller apple usb-cube power wall charger. Comes with the same power cube as the iPhones come with. No special high powered cube, as does the larger 11\" iPads require and came with. What a treat to use. I sold my iPad 3 for the same price as this mini costs, so I broke even. Plus, the old iPad 3 included ATT cell service. This iPad was the only wifi version. What to do? Get the ATT hotspot, nearly free and same monthly fee, and use this mini with the hotspot. Plus, hotspot allows multiple wifi devices to tap into the wifi hotspot, where as the built-in cell service on the iPad-3 only supplied cell service to that one device, your iPad -3.Save a lot by getting the iPad-mini wifi version, PLUS a hotspot. Best of all worlds. Much more functionality. Same fees.Don't let only one device hog your cell service, share it with a hotspot to all your iDevices (as well as all your non-apple wifi devices).PS. If you want your iPad mini NOW, this price is not that bad.And it was in stock.And shipping with prime was excellent.Just compare what other non-apple supply sources/stores are asking, like HSN or ShopNBC. Now THAT was highway robbery.Figure in NO TAX, availability, prime shipping, and there you are! IPad-mini in hand without the nightmare of entering the horrifying local Apple Store. EEEEK! TAX!

Update 11/28/12", "Author": "Morley Dotes \"morleydotes\"", "ReviewID": "R9B7NLZLPRIA9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Update November 28,2012:After using the mini for a while, I have to say that I now hate my ipad....and only use it when the minis are being used by my wife and kids....in fact, nobody wants to used the ipads any more. I also do notice a difference in speed. I think what is slowing me down is my router and possibly having too many things connecting to it. Unfortunately, I Lso find that I have a hard time connecting sometimes and sometimes the screen freezes and does ot let me do anything. This does not happen at regular times or during specific times, but seems to occur randomly. I recently was unable to connect to the app store, though I had full internet access, etc. after about fifteen minutes I was able to connect. I do not know what happened or what changed. I still think the keyboard is too small for me, but I have large hands and nobody else in the family seems to be complaining. Maybe I would do better if I got to use it more. I did see someone with a kindle fire and with nly a short look at it, I think the mini blows it away.....thought I like that the kindle has the sd card slot......if I find anything else worth noting I will update my review. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.Ok, so here's the thing, I have an iPad and a second generation iPad. My wife wanted the mini, so I bought it for her.....I just ordered a second one for me! I really like it more than the others. While it is significantly smaller, almost half the size, the actual screen size is comfortable and does not feel small. The borders are narrower than the full sized iPad, so the actual screen size is 4 13/16\" x 6 3/8\". The screen itself is very sharp and clear, and I feel like I'm 20 years younger (or at least my eyes feel that way). I wish I could say the same for the video quality. I take off a full star for that. Indoor quality with good lighting is mediocore at best (I wonder if something is wrong with mine?). Very grainy playback. I'm not impressed....I have not been able to play this on one of my HDTV's, perhaps it will show better, but I doubt it. My cell phone takes better video. I don't think I can be very happy about it, and I find it very hard to believe that this records at full HD, 1080p. If there is a way to tweak it, I wouldn't know because (here comes complaint number 2) it doesn't come with a user guide! No paper guide and no tutorial app (really, apple? There's so much new stuff, and no app, nothing???). I shouldn't have to search online or go to the apple store for information on how to maximize the use of my tablet.That should complete my complaints.....though you might hear a little more later. Now for the good stuff.... This thing is light! Two fingers light. The screen is also very bright and does a good job resisting finger prints. The LED Backlit display is crisp when viewing images and video that are actually made in good quality. The screen resolution looks much better than my second generation, but that's kind of an optical illusion I guess. They say the resolution is the same for both, so it must just look better because the screen is smaller. Here are some more stats:FaceTime camera: 1.2 mp photos and 720p video.iSight Camera: 5mp photo and 1080p video; f2.4 aperture; video stabilization; tap to focus and control exposure.Browsing is speedy, but honestly, I don't see much difference between my 2 and this. Viewing pages are fine and everything looks normal and sharp. Pages come up quickly and scroll fast. Zooming is also quick. I LOVE that you can multitask! Updating apps occurs in the background.Lots of great app, including photo and video editing and FaceTime, but for me, the reason to order a second one is Siri. Yup, that wonderful little digital assistant who will do anything for you...well, just about. I didn't know how much I needed Siri until I started to use it. I can now make appointments on the fly, make reminders, and organize my life in a way that was not previously known to me. This is THE best way for me to deal with so many different appointments, reminders, etc.. The sad part is that now I know I need an iPhone, as well! The children love the novelty of Siri, but I find it to be probably the most useful technology for me. It will be life-changing for me.....as long as I continue to use it. It will be so nice to finally be organized. Along with Siri is the ability to dictate message, etc. Just hold the microphone icon down for a second and start talking. I think that it is in need of some real sophistication, e.g. dragonspeak type quality. It will not place punctuation, and needs to be trained (I don't know how to do it yet, as I am still searching to see if that is even possible) to get better accuracy. An unofficial test estimates 70% or so accuracy, sometimes better if I speak slowly and there is no backround noise.The sound is also very good. Very clear. Not that loud, but then, you can't expect room filling sound....still, it is very acceptable. No complaints there. The only problem is with the lightning connector. I will have to buy an adaptor to connect the mini to all of my docks/speaker systems/etc. That's another thirty or forty dollars depending on which adaptor I decide to get.If you are looking for the user guide, go to the applestore and click on userguide, sorry, you're stuck, that's the only way. You would think they would include it in the iBooks app! I mean, really? How hard would that have been?I can't tell you if this is better or worse the the Kindle Fire because I have never seen one. If I find someone who has one I will do a full comparison. But for me, I think I need the technology that Siri offers (that's why I ordered the second one). If Kindle Fire has something similar, I am unaware of it, and will likely kick myself. :-) If you have any questions, I check for comments every couple of days.

It is pretty much practically new (though I only can speak for myself, others may have gotten iPads in worse conditions). I don't see any damages on mine and it works fine. If you want a brand spanking new and NOT PREVIOUSLY OWNED then don't buy from sellers on amazon. The iPad I have was bought roughly three months ago and my guess is the previous owner did not want it and sold it to one of these sellers you see here. I don't think these sellers can guarantee that the iPad is fully functional with nothing wrong with it but that it looks new and wasn't used for very long. I still have 9 months left on the warranty and the technical support is almost up in a few days this month. I don't know how iPads are packaged but it seemed to be packaged nicely though I can tell it was not brand spanking new from the box. The serial number and more stuff on the back looked smudged and the box was slightly bent at the corners. At first I attributed that to the shipping but it wouldn't look like that through shipping alone. I just want everyone to know what they're buying. If you can afford to buy it here then I suggest you go to apple and purchase a new one even with the tax. It's worth it I promise you. If you don't mind buying a previously owned iPad mini that is like new then by all means. I bought from iPadShop btw and it was fulfilled by amazon not that really means anything it just ships from an amazon fulfillment center instead of directly from the seller and I doubt they really check what they're getting but it just gave me peace of mind that if I did end up getting a lousy iPad atleast I felt that amazon would be held accountable for it. :) Anyway good luck shoppers and savers. <3", "Date": "September 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Useful and Convenient", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "R2PWSC4DH4HSAH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The iPad mini is an excellent little tablet. I use it every day and it works flawlessly.Pros:-Battery life is very, very satisfying. 9-10 hours as promised.-Light and compact. I can hold it for long periods without getting fatigued.-It just works. Apps work as advertised. Everything operates smoothly. Some juts or pauses every so often but nothing to get you frustrated (unlike my Galaxy Nexus).-Brightness. The screen can really pump out a bright image in direct sunlight or as a flashlight in the dark.-Premium feel. I almost always keep a case on it, but when I take it off I can really appreciate just how lavish the metallic finish and sturdy build feel in my hands. It really is a premium tablet that you wanna show off, as opposed to the new galaxy tabs that look like giant plastic phones.-Perfect size for media consumption. I read the news and watch videos daily, surf tumblr, Facebook, etc. The size just feels right for all of it.-Fantastic speakers. The bass won't \"boom\", but sound is clear and VERY loud for the size of the tablet. Easily fill a small room with ambience.Cons:-Screen resolution. It's alright with iOS 6. But I have the iOS 7 beta, which everyone gets in fall. The font is much slimmer and therefore looks VERY pixelated and jagged. They may change it before the official release but I doubt it as it's a huge part of the system overhaul. I'm still waiting for the retina mini.-iPhone-only apps that aren't specifically made for iPad look like crap. They don't show them in retina resolution, but pre-iPhone 4 QVGA blown up. It looks terrible. The only workaround I found is jailbreaking and downloading Retinapad, which forces the apps into retina resolution. They look great after doubling the pixels.-The usual apple limitations. No direct music download, no SD slot, limited customization. Here aren't really downfalls of the mini, just apple's devices as a whole.Overall I love my iPad. Like I said, I have the iOS 7 beta and I know everyone will love this little tab even more when that rolls out. Better notification drawer, intuitive multitasking (no more little X's to repeatedly tap!), quick controls, it's all boss. I highly recommend it. The only thing I'd love more is a retina version, supposedly coming this fall. If you can wait 3 months, I'd hold off for that. Otherwise, dive into the addiction like the rest of us.

I graduated just before computers started to be used in schools and became the norm for the generation after me.  I learned on an Apple but haven't been able to afford them since. I am good at learning as I go I am not afraid to press the a button and ask questions later to get to where I want to be so I do travel somewhat dangerously but for me that is how I discover the best things on an unknown device.

I will admit I was the main person saying how stupid it was for apple to come out with an ipad mini and I was wrong!

When I went to the apple store I looked at the ipad mini and ipad 4 and I didn't notice a severe difference between the retina screen and ipad mini screen. I love my mini it's so light weight and I put it in my purse and literally take it every where. I use to do the same with my ipad 2nd generation but it was very heavy. If you're looking to buy something that is portable light weight and to replace anything that you already have this is it. I'm a college student and I use my mini more than I use my laptop...I have my textbooks on it write papers read powerpoints listen to lectures and record my teachers in class on it. I also read books magazines and watch tv and movies on it as well as playing games and sketching. \"addicted to sims and cut the rope\".

I, myself, have tried the Android phones and tablets but have come back to Apple for two main reasons: Consistency and Quality,I have always wanted an iPad but the cumbersome and awkward size was always the turn off to me. I wanted something easy to carry and put away; the iPad just seemed a bit too large. I eventually gave in to an Android tablet and Enjoyed it to an extent but it became clunky and cluttered. The quality felt a bit too plasticky as well.Then Apple announced the iPad Mini and I was ready to give it a try. THIS DEVICE ROCKS! I cannot say enough good things about it; it's the quality hardware and software Apple is known for. I can always count on my iPad Mini to work and do so like it did the first time, never slowing down.So... If you are in the market for a small tablet and don't mind paying the premium I highly recommend the iPad Mini. Sure, it's a bit more expensive but if you have it know you are paying for a slick device that won't turn into a frustrating paper weight next year. :)", "Date": "May 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Note required", "Author": "Artem", "ReviewID": "RDV7K5Y8UQBNP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Would be a very useful note to this product: Wi-Fi model have no gps module.Anyway it is excellent thing :)", "Date": "May 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Moved from the Kindle Fire (1st gen) to the iPad Mini, loving the change", "Author": "Angela Streiff", "ReviewID": "R2BA9H0Y9FUOAS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the original Kindle Fire when it was first released. I was so excited to get it, I pre-ordered in advance so I could have release day delivery. And for the next several months, I loved it. The screen was beautiful. However I had a few scares with it.The first issue I had with the Kindle was on a few occasions, it just didn't turn on. After discovering how to do a hard-reset, I was able to get it back up and running, and just did this whenever it wouldn't turn on again. Then one day while I was playing music on it via the iHeartRadio application, it started to overheat (wasn't aware that the Kindle even could overheat) and after the music that was playing started skipping, it froze up. I picked it up and found the back near the battery hot to the touch. It would not turn off, so I did a hard reset (as suggested by Amazon). After that, it never turned back on. Thankfully, Amazon quickly replaced my Kindle Fire (for free) and when I received my new one, everything was back to normal. However by this time, I had gotten my first iPhone (4s). I was surprised how much faster the internet browser and applications ran on my small phone, compared to the Kindle Fire. So I ended up using my iPhone more often than my Kindle.On month after Amazon replaced my 1st generation Kindle Fire, they released the new line of Kindles. I almost ordered one of the new HD ones, but decided to wait and see how the reviews compared to this iPad mini, which was released around the same time.Now months later, I'm hearing reports from people who did order the new Kindle Fire HD that they too are running into problems here and there with this new version. After doing a lot of research, I discovered that statistically, Apple products have fewer claims for warranty work than other brands. I'm by no means an Apple-Fangirl, and prefer to use Windows PC's in my own home. But I hate having my brand new items break down, even if they are covered by a warranty. When I spend hundreds on something, I just want it to work, and would rather never need to know how how good a warranty is or not. So the statistics of the Apple products having better reliability was the deciding factor.When comparing the Kindle Fire to the iPad mini, I will say that Kindle (especially the new ones) have a more vivid screen. The Kindle screens are beautiful and the colors are amazing. However that's where the majority of the advantages over the Mini ended for me. The iPad mini has nice web browser, the applications work well (less crashing issues), the wireless connection is fast and I didn't have any sort of lag between turning on my Mini and getting online, like I often did with my Kindle. The mini has been everything I hoped it would be, and I love the size.The iPad mini is super thin. So thin, I actually worry at times it's too slim. It's such a nice piece of hardware, I tend to worry that the ultra slim design might make it too delicate. Thankfully, they make cases like the OtterBox Defender Series Hybrid Case for iPad Mini for people like myself who want to put the delicate Mini into a super duty case. I'm glad I did, since it's taken a tumble or two in the last month I've owned it, and inside the case it stays unharmed.I do love the small size of the Mini. I needed something smaller than the large iPad, but also needed something larger than my iPhone. Something that would fit into my handbag, but that I could also easily read, check and reply to my email on. The screen is very responsive and the speakers produce nice sound, better than the iPhone's. The Mini is perfect for me, and I'm so glad decided on it. Everything works just as well or better than I had hopped for, and I've passed my Kindle Fire down to my pre-teen daughter, who loves it.", "Date": "May 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Small but powerful", "Author": "Leonardo Dugarte", "ReviewID": "R2MUZQGQ6271RJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Talk about Apple products is to talk about excellence, innovation, design, simplicity, utility.

This iPad mini easily slips into a purse or jacket pocket making it easy to carry around for either a female or male.  You get all of the perks of the regular iPad with the extra benefit of being able to carry it around with you everywhere.  Simply amazing!I love my iPad and use it more than any other electronic devise but I mourned its lack of portability.  The iPad's size is great for watching tv, movies, reading books or light document work but a hassle to carry around.  I had to dig out my huge purse to carry it around anywhere and the weight and size was cumbersome.  This iPad mini is slimmer, lighter and smaller and oh so convenient to take with me when I leave the house.The smaller size does impact my document usage but since I use it mostly for entertainment, this is really minor for me but will affect those who use the iPad for work.  I keep hearing the iPad mini lacks the same power (slower processor) as the iPad but I don't feel it.  I've played games on it, watched videos, etc. without any noticeable difference.  Maybe power is an issue with heavy document usage?  I did deduct a half star for the lower screen resolution than the newest iPad while keeping the price tag around $350.  Seriously?  The lower resolution is not so much apparent on iTunes purchases but more visible on home video or other sourced digital media.How does Apple seduce me into wanting their newest product (although, I'm proud so say I avoided their siren's call for the iPhone 5) and after using it, making it the newest best thing I cannot live without?  Husband says it makes the regular iPad positively clunky and almost archaic but I think it's more sinister - it makes me appreciate the iPad for home use and the iPad mini for away-from-home use.  Great, now I've used up my gift allowance for all of 2013....but you won't find me complaining this Christmas, birthday or anniversary because the iPad mini is worth it!Overall, if you can splurge this is the one thing you really want to spend your money on.

The iPad and iPad Mini by far are the best for all around functionality.  Even thoughthe Mini doesn't have the high resolution screen, the screen is bright, colorful and crisp clear.  At 7 inches it is larger than the other devices at comparable size.  The UI is thebest by far the best of the bunch.  The customer service that I received by Apple was hands down the best customer service I've ever received from any company ever during my 54years of living.  The Apple employees were friendly, helpful, took time with me, answered my ignorant questions without making me feel dumb and the employees were just incredible.I had problem and called Apple support.  They worked with me and resolved the problem.  It was a few days later that I got a call from Tim Cook's assistant.  Yes, fromthe CEO of Apple.  He said he was aware I had a problem and wanted to know if it was fixed.  He said Tim had told him to call me and see if I was still having the problem.  I'venever had that from any other company.  I was extremely impressed that someone at that level would take the time over my problem.  As I compare these devices and showstudents and staff where I work I will definitely be bias toward the iPad Mini, not only because of the quality and user experience of the device, but because I know Apple's customer serviceis the best by a large margin in the industry.", "Date": "December 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fast Shipment", "Author": "Joi Duffy", "ReviewID": "R37D1D6SF77747", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Item as described brand new!

I'm coming from an iPad 2 so I haven't used the retina screens daily, but I am a graphic designer so visual are very important to me. I find the screen stands up well to the Kindle Fire and Nexus 7.

I ended up purchasing this iPad mini off eBay.  It is great.  The tab took a few minutes to turn on and off.  The mini takes less than a second to turn on and off.  Typing without mistakes on the mini is easy because the screen sensitivity is just right.  Scrolling on the mini is easy too.  The sound is not that great on the mini though.  Galaxy tab is louder and the sound tones are better.  The tab picked up a signal everywhere.  I have to cross my fingers that the mini will pick up a signal.  This confuses me since both of them are on Verizon networks.  Would I recommend?  Yes until galaxy tab fixes the mistakes it has made with the current tab models.  Was it worth the cost?  I got the item used. But I do think we are paying more for the apple name instead of the product itself.  With that said I am typing this review on the mini.

Kids are tough on these so I wanted to get an AppleCare protection plan in case she broke something.  As soon as it was delivered, I took it to an Apple retail store to buy the program - but Apple says that the AppleCare program must be purchased within 30 days of purchase.  Unfortunately - that means 30 days from when it was directly purchased from Apple.  This was purchased from Apple by a third party vendor and distributed through Amazon more than 30 days before it was shipped to me - so the device was no longer eligible for the AppleCare program.  I have two options - return it to Amazon and purchase another device directly from Apple (this specific model has been discontinued by Apple and is no longer available from them) or I can just give it to my grandkid, along with a really good protective case - and HOPE that my two year old doesn't break it.

This one was easy to handle and pick up and hold to play with it other than me having to do a little searching real fast to find out how to turn it off. The screen and borders look nice. It got here in perfect condition with all its accessories! The white color shines and is easy to look at and clean! I checked it and it operates just fine!

I.O.S 7 is fast, it's completely changed Apple's look. It's got new backgrounds that move. The only problem is it takes 3.1 GB.  Next the Ipad Mini (I think) is better than the Ipad 3 and 4 gen.

The iPad mini is almost perfect for traveling and browsing the internet but the lack of power really holds it back from getting 5 stars for me.  The iPad mini struggles a bit to play HD movies/shows... I usually use my mini at hotels hooked up via HDMI to the hotel TV so I can watch movies/etc full screen.  I don't have too many issues with playing SD videos but HD videos stutter a lot and are pretty much unwatchable (should be noted that the HD files I used were h264 files in an mkv container and played via an app called Azul).  It would be great if the mini had a retina screen as well because text would be much easier to read.

However, after using it, I have changed my mind. The size is what truly changed my mind. The fact that it's smaller seemed cute at first, and then extremely useful once I started carrying it around. I used to carry my iPad 2 in my purse and it made it extremely bulky. I can't even tell that the iPad Mini is in my purse. Holding it is not as \"cumbersome\" as a full sized iPad. It feels very nice in your hand, though I can't fully use it with one hand as Apple advertised. But, I can hold it much easier than the iPad 2. The image quality is not that of the iPad with Retina Display. But I don't really need a retina display on my iPad, and I can't imagine that everyone else does.I use my iPad primarily for graduate school, and I can see this coming in extremely handy. I keep all of my textbooks on the iPad and take notes on it as well. I watch lectures on it, write papers on it, among other things.

I currently have the iPhone 5 so I decide, after a lot of research. to go with the iPad Mini. After giving it a full charge I started running it thru its paces, registering and getting all my favorite Apps loaded. Then I started to notice that I was losing battery very quickly. An average of 1% every 2 minutes. So I went into settings and did all the tricks; lower brightness, turned off notifications, manual email receive, etc.. Even though it did improve slightly it was not dramatic. I was also noticing that it was slow and had quite a bit of lag compared to my iPhone 5. I ran some video and it was constantly buffering. So I did some speed test across my WiFi and found it was running at about half the speed of my iPhone 5 and laptop. So I decided to do a hard reset,  bleed the battery to zero, then charge it to 100% and then reload everything. Well the charging took forever but I figured this was the first time to zero and back so I'll give it a chance. I started loading it back and had all the same issues. Bummer. So I opened a case with Apple. They are excellent BTW. After the basic testing and trouble shooting Apple decided that they would start by replacing the battery. But I decided rather than continuing to put in a lot of extra time trying to get this unit to work for me I would just return it. Amazon was great with the return process. I give them 5 stars. Apple support was great. I give them 5 stars. My particular iPad Mini. 1 star. Hopefully it was just a fluke bad unit.", "Date": "June 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Shameless cash grab device from Apple", "Author": "Irish-Mike", "ReviewID": "RLPYS4SUKDXP2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Okay, I was a huge apple fan for many years.  In spite of their walled garden mentality, I've always felt that Apple was the best money could buy.  However, I've slowly soured on Apple's business model.  The Ipad mini is nothing more than a miniturazed ipad 2.  The interals with exception of the camera arer exactly the same.  So, when one looks at what he/she is paying for it's outdated 2 year old technology.  This device was outdated and obsolete, before it even hit store shelves.  What does this mean for the consumer?  It means that as soon as the new Retina Mini comes out with 2gigs of ram, you will likely need to upgrade.  Let's consider here that apple has a history of forced obsolescence.  This means they can and often do abandon a previous generations product, when the new one comes out.  An example of this can be seen in the Ipad 1.  The first gen Ipad arrived in April of 2010.  In November of 2012, Apple stopped supporting it with the latest ios update, after ios 5.  This means that customers that purchased the 64 gig cellular model for over $850.00 now have an overpriced paperweight...but at least we still have the beautiful logo to admire.  When apple first introduced the Ipad, the company promoted it as a virtual replacement to the laptop and while I never really subscribed to this notion, I do feel as though at nearly a $1000 dollar expense, this should buy me a lot more than a shade over 2 years before the company forces the customer to upgrade, or be left behind.  Now, there will be those that say, \"Apple doesn't force you to do anything.\"  I beg to differ.  Yes, they indeed do.  Outside of music purchases in Itunes, do I as a consumer have the right to use my digitally purchased content on a non apple device?  The answer is no.  So, if I choose not to upgrade my old ipad, my content is locked tight in Itunes and I have no means to access it.  This is the nature of a \"walled garden\" and I as a consumer understand this.  But when apple supporters buy in to this(at a high price point I might add) we receive no assurances that our purchase has a shelf life of greater than a couple years at best, or 6 months at worst.  See again, those who purchased an ipad 3 only to be surprised by the quick release of the 4.  By the way, Apple no longer manufactures the 3.  So if you have problems with it, you have to pay for the cost of repairs at this point or purchase a 4.  It's just a matter of time before consumers of the Ipad 3 begin to feel the very same pain of those who puchased a first gen Ipad.My biggest issue with the mini?  The price.  Come on apple...The ipad Mini cost by most accounts $112 dollars to make and is sold at a starting price of $329...Give me a break.  As we go up in storage capacity, it will cost us no less than $100 dollars...this is pure lunacy.  I am no fanboy of any brand, but if we look at Google and Amazon's investment in cloud storage, we begin to see how rediculous it is to pay for onboard storage.  Apple's Icloud is nothing more than a sync service; it is not a true cloud based service.  Apple has no insentive to invest in true cloud service because to do so would hurt their bottom line, because they would not be able to charge the consumer for extra storage, as the cloud eliminates this need, for the most part.  The cloud is the biggest threat to Apple's business model and would surely drive profit margins down even further than they are already.  Please understand I am not an apple hater; but I am simply no longer a blind consumer and am informed enough to see that in this case, apple is successfully marketing and selling repackaged crap in a smaller bag...but again, at least we still get the nice apple logo, which of course comforts us and helps us to reaffirm our fabulous purchase of a brand new old idevice.", "Date": "May 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "High price for two year old shrunken down iPad2 specs", "Author": "GoTheDistance", "ReviewID": "R3K8TNK6XWSSUN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Demo'd this in person and my conclusion is Apple is charging a premium for nearly two year old iPad2 specs with a low-end low-resolution display.

Everything else gets slimmer and cooler and thankfully the ipad mini has been redesigned from the ground up to be the slim sleek product apple is known for.

No where near the customization available to android users.-Stereo speakers are welcome, but not when they are placed one inch apart, come on apple...-Itunes is a pain (not as bad as Microsoft, but still cumbersome at times)COMMENTS:-People keep stating NFC is a con.. it's an apple, get over it. buy an android product-People complain about lack of Retina display.  Get over it, the pixel size is still comparable with the ipad 2 and the goal was portability, not pixel density.INNOVATION:I think apple would benefit from incorporating GPS into every product they sell and then offering free 3G for all location services, no email, no internet, BUT free location updates for all those apps that rely on location services.  Maybe your comments won't post until you get home (or a free wifi location), but you would get the benefits of integrated gps for accurate navigation and location info.

It costs about twice as much, but for that- I don't have to use workarounds to stream Amazon Prime, and there are a lot of productivity apps that work best on iPad- the Android versions almost seem to be after thoughts.This is sleek, lightweight, easy to hold in one hand and the screen is very touch responsive. The display looks really good. Using the Kindle app- the graphic novels look great. I don't actually recommend it for serious reading because it is back lit which can be wearying to read for extended lengths.Battery time is pretty good with this too. At this point, it gets used a few hours a day and needs to be charged every other day.On a personal note- my husband likes using this at night to stream shows, and we either cuddle and watch them together, or I'll go to sleep.

When I was growing up, there were few gadgets around to satisfy my gadget need; however, since I have reached my \"golden years\" there are gadgets galore.  My first electronic gadget I bought when was when I was in college - the second time.  A chemistry class was making my little ole numbers-handicapped brain spin.  Then along came the Texas Instruments calculator...WOW, it ran on batteries and figured out things for me.  I was in heaven and so began my love of electronic gadgets.  As a professional I had a plethora of electronic gadgets at my disposal (and I still did anesthesia with a calculator.)  The gadgets did get more complex, and expensive, as I got older and I do have a \"thing\" for laptop computers and have owned several...I prefer to surf in my lounge chair, with the computer in lap, my feet up, and a tv show in front of me as opposed to sitting at a desk, etc. Then I planned a trip to Europe this year.  I wanted to be able to communicate with the folks back home without having to tote my laptop, so what to do.  Well, BINGO...you got it.  I needed an iPad!  And where do I go to purchase all my best \"Good Gadgets\"???  To my laptop and Amazon of course!!!  Didn't take long before I located my sweet, little, cool, white, handy-dandy, baby who computes from my lounge chair and any place else with wi-fi...and she weighs much less than the laptop, even fits in my purse.  With Amazon in charge and freebie electronics actually providing the product for my purchase...WOW, what a deal.  Amazon's usually lightening fast, but I had my little, cool, shiny, new, white, baby in less than 2 days - all securely packed and ready to rumble.  And so we have continued to do sending messages/pictures home from Europe, playing games (which I never did before), and reading my fav magazines...SUCH A DEAL!  Give them a try!

I returned mine after a few days of use as there are too many limitations with tablets (especially of this expense) and I'd rather have a laptop or just use my smartphone. Things I enjoyed about the iPad mini: perfect size in my opinion, easy to set up and use, wide availability of apps and accessories, Amazon app available, nice email interface, bluetooth capable, clear high quality display. The things I didn't like about this device:1. Moving files from a computer to the iPad mini has to be done via iTunes, you can't just copy over a folder of music or videos which is do-able just not as easy as on Android based devices2. Price is quite a bit more than other 7\" tablets, but the screen is actually 8\" and for an Apple product, I'd say a pretty good value3. Keyboard has no tracing or 'swype' like abilities which makes typing cumbersome without a keyboard.4. App store makes you give a password for every single app you download (even the free ones)5. As an e-reader, I'd chose one of the paper-white options over this, but it works fine for reading.6. Its not a laptopThe last reason is my primary justification for returning the device. For a tablet it does what it is suppose to do. But I found myself still preferring to use my small laptop as multitasking is so much easier. I'd say if you really like using apps or playing games or simple web browsing, a tablet is the way to go. I personally found that for me the full computing power of a laptop is worth the extra weight/size, especially given the cost of this device (i.e., you can buy a small laptop for the cost of the iPad mini). However, if you like tablets, you will find this one a good option.

Most apps are under $5 each, and you get learning value along with the fun factor. Plus you can access the library and borrow books, and so much more.The mini is the perfect size for his small hands (he's 6 but the size of a 9 yr old). It's easy to use and the graphics are really nice. Mind you, I'm not a tech junky...but we have had it for over a month and it gets used a few hours each day and we have never had an issue. The charge lasts for a long time also.I recommend getting the Otterbox for it. Especially if a kid is going to be using it! I found the mini sized Otterbox for about $35 here on Amazon.

I've used Apple and Android cell phones, tablets, windows and apple Computers and (Linux). I'm very pleased with my purchase of the iPad Mini, It's everything I wanted and nothing I didn't. It's cheaper then the full sized one, it's smaller, it's easy to hold, theres tons of apps like with all iOS Devices, The battery lasts a good amount of time, the screen is very bright, the speakers are well built in ones but at that there very good, I'd recommend buying the Apple smart cover it makes that iPad you bought that much better, I've had it since day one and it's an amazing combo. I'm able to protect it, keep it apple clean and stylish, and it folds into a stand, and it unlocks it and locks it when closed and open.

The price was the final determining factor when I purchased my Fire HD 8.9 at the beginning of the year. I have had the mini for a few weeks now and I certainly enjoy it.  For one thing, it is easier to slip into my purse.  It is lighter and smaller than the \"fire\". The podcasts I enjoy are not available with the \"fire\", but I could listen to them on my iPhone 5.  BUT, I must say, overall, I like my Fire HD 8.9 best.  If I were to purchase a tablet today (and could only have one tablet) my choice would be the new Fire HDX 7 inch.  I also would consider the 16G. With cloud storage, it is possible to get along with the 16G.  However, the price difference for the 16G and 32G is certainly more reasonable with the Fire than the iPad. Dollar for dollar Amazon has knocked this one out of the ball park.

Hey apple do ya ever test out your products. Do you think now one is going to drop your swarovski glass? Get a kindle fire for a cheaper price. Pretty much get any tablet other than this.

On top of that it seems an ipad is very limited to what an ipad can actually be used for. You will still need a regular laptop or home computer for most things, for iPad doesn't allow, which is A Lot!. iPad mini is basically a big mobile unit. It's not looked at as a laptop.
