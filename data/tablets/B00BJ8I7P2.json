{"Reviews": [{"Title": "For the price, Asus hits the sweet spot. Great budget tablet.", "Author": "Max Harry Johnson", "ReviewID": "R2BM3WVXR7V5GJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a very good tablet that come with a lot of useful features. The only main weak point is the screen resolution which is slightly outdated for 10\" devices today, but its acceptable. The unit I had have some minor issues with the digitizer (touchscreen), but it was an isolated issue and I don't believe many others should experience it.As of writing, I can not think of another device that come with all its feature at its price point:-Tegra3 quadcore CPU-standard microUSB charging port (not proprietary like the Transformer tablets)-dedicated microHDMI port (TV connectivity)-USB On-the-Go support out of the box (using a separate microUSB OTG adaptor you can connect things such as mouse, keyboard, flash drives and gamepads)-microSD card expansion-acceptable HD IPS screen-great WiFi and GPS performance-other little things like stereo speakers, front and back cameraBuild: Two things I really like, first it have an even weight distribution and feel light for a 10\" tablet. Secondly, it doesn't have heat issues. The tablet doesn't get hot at all, at most it might get warm, this can be a big deal in term of using the device comfortably for lengthy periods. It has a plastic body, but doesn't feel like it would fall apart. Though if you try to twist it or put pressure on the screen you can feel slight flexing. I definitely will get a case and screen protector for this. Just hoping the microUSB charging port would last since I feel it's not as firm as it could be, but this is just feeling about microUSB ports.Performance: Sure the 1.2ghz quadcore Tegra3 CPU provided isn't latest spec anymore, but it still fast enough and can perform all activities with few stutters. You will be able to browse the web and watch 1080p videos smoothly. Gaming should be a good experience as well. I still think Asus can optimize their OS better, it is not as smooth comparing to full stock Android found in Nexus devices of course. You can expect the battery to last the whole day on a full charge.Screen: Images and videos look great with decent viewing angle. For me the colors are just right, its not saturated so it won't be popping. If you are someone who is used to overly saturated colors this screen might look washed out to your eyes. Very small texts will not be smooth looking, its mainly due to the 1280x800 resolution on a large 10\" screen. If you required sharp and clear texts and do a lot of reading, its better to buy a tablet with higher resolution. The screen is not protected by Gorilla glass so be careful with it and use screen protector. The touchscreen is extremely sensitive.Speakers: It's nice they're stereo, they have a slight muffled or warm sound to it, but are decent and doesn't suffer from crackle even at high volumes. One particularly annoying thing is the sound from the speakers cause vibration to the back of the device (made of plastic) and can tickle your palm when you're holding the device. The remedy for this is simply to hold the device on its edges. Also, this device do not have a vibrating module.Storage: You'll get a total of 11.7GB of actual storage space in addition to the a microSD slot. It doesn't take long to copy several gigabytes of data to the device and installing apps is fast. Running a benchmark program, I get a write speed of around 10-12MB/sec and a read speed up to 36MB/sec.WiFi/GPS: I'm impressed with the WiFi signal and the download speed is fast. It appear to support both GPS and GLONASS and gets strong signal.Cameras: They're average, you'll need good lightning to take good photos. It come with front camera/microphone as well, so you can do VoIP and video chats.Important info about the digitizer (touchscreen): There might be a minor issues with inconsistent digitizer reading for this device, but its probably just the unit that I got. At times it doesn't detect 'tap-and-hold' and 'pinch-to-zoom' anymore. Also 'long gestures' can get choppy. For example, if I set a lockscreen pattern, sometimes it can be difficult to successfully draw out the full unlock pattern because the screen cannot connect your finger from point to point, it gets cut mid way and I get locked out of the device. These small issues pop up occasionally and spontaneously. I find that to help improve this issue, go to Settings -> Accessibility -> select 'Touch & hold delay' \u200b-> change the setting to either \"Medium\". This will help greatly, but it doesn't cure the problem completely. Again this is most likely an isolated issue with just my unit.So far I'm very happy with the features being offered at its price point, except the issue with unstable digitizer. It's a good tablet to get if you are on a budget, but wants something with plenty of features.", "Date": "March 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "ASUS MeMo Pad. High End At A Good Price.", "Author": "Marc Klein", "ReviewID": "R8K7MHRAX96EU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The ASUS MeMo Pad is basically the Transformer Pad without the docking pins only better and while my 1st ASUS was the Asus Nexus 7 1B32 7-Inch 32 GB Tablet comparing it to would not be fair as that was done according to Google's specifications. What I can tell you is that this trumps that and here's why:1)Dual SpeakersMost tablets have one speaker and thus you get Mono sound but with this you get two which provides stereo surrounding sound which, in my opinion sounds excellent and in some cases you can hear the vibration. I do think that the speakers were put in the wrong place but I think ASUS designed it with the theory that people will use landscape mode which if you look  I think you'll understand why it makes sense.2)CameraI'm pretty sure no one walks out with a tablet and thinking they would use the camera instead of the ones on their phones. I've used it when I had an iPad but it's rare that I do it. Regardless, I have yet to test the camera so I can't really comment on it but there's no flash in the back so be warned. There's a front and a back so that's a plus if you want to use Facetime. The back is 5 MP while the front is 1.23)AppsThere's little to no bloatware anywhere on the device. ASUS put some of their stuff on here and it's touch and go on whether or not you find a need for it, They do give you free cloud storage out of the box (They give you 5GB for free) so that's a plus. I use Dropbox which for me is just as good. But the one thing I do like is that ASUS has a software called backup which essentially is it'll store all your apps if you ever need to reset the device. How this differs from Google Play is something I don't know as I have yet to have a need for this. Basically, ASUS tried to cover their bases on what their customers felt they would need or want.4)Design  It is very light I will say that. Very thin around the edges and easy to hold. I can tell you that the back doesn't feel cheap or plastic. But it also doesn't slide when you hold it. Actually, it's an easy grip and not so much of a fingerprint magnet. Although for me, my arms began to hurt after awhile but that may have been because of the position I was in.5)FeaturesHere's where the meat and potatoes lie. It's what you decide on when deciding on purchasing it or not so here we go: It is Jellybean out of the box but once you get through the initial setup, there's an update to 4.1 and that is current on the tablet. Whether it gets 4.2 and up is to early to say but ASUS is very good with updates across their devices.It has the usual:WiFiGPSBluetooth  And in a first, ASUS finally ditched proprietary and replaced it with a micro USB which is way better and this is what I prefer.. While it only has 16GB, there's an expendable slot for an SD card. Any SD card will do folks. Also, you'll be happy to know that ASUS also included a port for HDMI right next to the USB one.Some complain there's no flash on here but that has nothing to do with ASUS or Google. Adobe no longer supports it and it's been replaced with HTML 5. Though, feel free to side load it if you want.It also comes with NVIDIA TEGRA 3 Quad Core which is very powerful especially if you play a lot of games. When I played Beach Buggy Blitz the water effects splashed onto my screen like 3D. That is the power of this chip and it's as real as you are gonna get.This tablet is the real deal folks. The price is very reasonable with what's inside. I've seen tablets with these same exact specs priced higher so at $299 this is practically a steal. Plus it has everything a user wants. The only thing missing is NFC but to me this isn't really a deal breaker nor should it be.Some might complain that it has no dock pins for the keyboard and honestly, if I wanted a laptop I'd have gotten one. But also remember that in order to keep costs low, sacrifices need to be made and since this isn't in the Transformer family, ASUS felt that it was not that important to keep. While it would have been cool, if it really is important to you, you can always buy a folio in it's place.Available in Midnight Blue, Crystal White and Fuchsia Pink,  ASUS has put out a winner and after spending a little over a week with this baby, I say if you're looking for a tablet look no further.", "Date": "March 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "A (pretty) great value", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3MOTCO1JYROD6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm very pleased with the quality and performance of this product, but it has taken some time to get used to the the tablet \"form factor\" and the quirks of the Android operating system. This review will touch on those issues as well as my impressions of the Asus MeMo Pad Smart 10 itself.Screen Resolution. For some reason most tablet reviews start with the screen resolution. The Asus Memo 10 has 1280 x 800 pixels versus the Nexus 10's 2560 x 1600 and the iPad4's 2048 x 1536.  Perhaps the greater resolution on the Nexus and iPad4 does have some benefits, but I don't know what they might be. Text and colors are very clear and bright on the Asus. By having four times as many pixels, the Nexus is locked into needing more processing power just to update screen content. To what end? There may be real benefits, but I don't see them -- and that's the point! The screen resolution for both text and images is very, very good.Processing power. With a quad-core Tegra3 processor, this is a speedy tablet. Judging by how it runs the 3D graphics of NVDIA Glowball, it shouldn't have any problems with advanced games. It certainly has no problems in ordinary use when browsing, reading ebooks, handling multiple applications at once, and so on.Speakers. One of the best features of this tablet is the quality of the speakers. Sound quality is reasonably good for such tiny speakers and the volume is impressive. When the volume is all the way up, the tablet can fill a fairly large room with music. I no longer need to plug in an external speaker in order to watch a movie with my wife.(Update 4/17/2013. After using the speakers at full volume for about a week, they have developed an annoying rattle or buzz. I must now plug in an external speaker for music or use headphones. The initial volume was too good to remain true!)Software. One of the real strengths of this tablet is the vast assortment of apps -- many of them free. The Asus Memo 10 comes preloaded with a set of basic of apps to help those (like me) who are new to the Android OS. Using Google's Play Store one can effortlessly download and install any number of other apps. Since I use Kindles for most of my reading, it was nice to find the Amazon Kindle app preinstalled. The Amazon Appstore for Android is not preinstalled but can be downloaded from Amazon's website and gives access to Amazon's free app of the day. One disadvantage of Android software is that there is rarely an adequate help file. This makes it a real challenge to figure out how to take full advantage of the various aspects of the programs.My biggest initial challenge was to find a decent application for writing. Google Drive seemed ideal except that I couldn't find a way to get it to spell check complete documents -- (It does spell check \"on the fly\")--so my first  solution was to use a little app called Writer. It has a decent spell check implementation, but documents are limited in length and it cannot directly edit documents on Google Drive. I had to open my document in Google Drive, 'long-press' anywhere in the document to allow selecting all of the text, and create a new Writer document in which to paste that text. After editing, I reversed the process to paste the edited text back into my Google Drive document. At least this somewhat inconvenient system allowed cross-platform access to my documents. But the tablet keyboard was a bit too responsive so that extra characters or wrong keys were common. After some research I installed SwiftKey tablet keyboard and made it my default. I'm impressed. It is a very handy keyboard. Typing is far more accurate than on the other keyboards I have tried so far.  Capitalization and apostrophes are handled automatically. Word prediction is pretty good. It costs money, but it could be worth it. The keyboard works as it should both in Google Drive and in the browser's Gmail or the Android Gmail app. Problem solved. (Update 5/9/2013 Android 4.2 includes a much-improved keyboard with \"on the fly\" spell check and the ability to type using swipe gestures. To upgrade the table to Android 4.2.1 go to Settings > About Tablet > System Update.) Kingsoft Office is the best Android word processing application that I have discovered so far. You can use it to directly edit documents on Google drive and it includes an adequate spell check feature.Streaming video. One of my main reasons for buying a tablet was to improve streaming video from YouTube and Amazon Prime. YouTube worked perfectly from the start, limited only by the speed of the wifi connection. To get Amazon prime video to stream, it was necessary to side-load Flash and use the native android browser. But it does work--and very well indeed. (Update. It Did work! Amazon seems to have done something to bollix up flash support in android browsers. I am not happy about that! I will update this review again if I can discover at way to solve this problem. Update2. Puffin browser shows Amazon Prime videos but there is a bit of lag. Better than nothing. Update 3. As of May 23, you can once again stream Amazon Prime Video without lag using the native android browser, Chrome, Firefox or Dolphin as long as you have side-loaded Flash! )Slideshow. A ten-inch tablet is,  of course,  a media consumption device and to some extent a productivity  tool,  but when not in use, it also makes a very handy digital photo frame. All one needs to do is load up some photos, which is very easy to do because of the micro sd card slot. One great feature of this tablet is that you can easily set it up to show a slideshow of your favorite photos on the desktop background as well as on the sleep screen. To do so, pull down the menu with the blue icons at the top right corner. Tap Settings>Display>Home-and-Lock-Screen>Live Wallpapers>Asus MyFrame, and then choose a folder containing the photos you wish to display.Sd card slot. This is a vital feature. The Google Nexus 10 lacks one. The iPad4 lacks one.  Yet without an sd card slot, it is much more difficult to transfer songs, photos, and documents to and from the device. If you have permanent access to a high speed data connection, fine. If not and if you wish to store your songs and videos right on the device itself, you will want an sd card slot. Besides, a 16 gig tablet is somewhat short of internal space. It is handy to be able to expand the storage as needed.The tiny and perhaps delicate mini-usb connection is potentially a serious flaw because this eminently breakable connector is the sole way of recharging the tablet. With a newly purchased machine, be very careful when plugging in the mini-usb connector. With time and a bit of practice, I have gotten the feel of this, but I am still careful.Thoughts on the 10-inch tablet form factor:A ten-inch tablet is a bit too large to grip firmly with one hand, and this one is even a little slippery. I have large hands and can hold it one-handed in portrait mode, but generally I need to use two hands--and exercise caution even then.Learn to love your microfiber cloth. Tablets are renowned for picking up fingerprints and this one is no exception. Keep a microfiber cloth with you at all times.In landscape mode this tablet has a large, comfortable keyboard--especially with the SwiftKey tablet keyboard mentioned earlier. Touch typing is perhaps possible. The upgraded keyboard in Android 4.2.1 is superb! It has a great swipe capability and on-the-fly spell checking.All in all I think I may prefer the form factor of a Chrome netbook or an ultra book, but in most respects this is a fine tablet.UPDATE 6/15/2013. I have recently upgraded my experience with this tablet by making three inexpensive purchases. First I bought a Moko Slim Cover Case [[ASIN:B00BP5NIKI MoKo Slim Cover Case for ASUS MeMo Pad Smart ME301 / ME301T 10.1 inch Android 4.1 Jelly Bean tablet, BLACK (with Flip Stand, Integrated Elastic Hand Strap, and Stylus Loop)]. This nicely protects the screen and provides a fairly stable viewing stand. Next I bought an inexpensive set of styluses, which minimize fingerprints on the screen and make navigation much easier. Finally, I bought an inexpensive micro USB to USB OTG (on the go) adaptor. This gives the tablet a full-sized USB port for plugging in various accessories such as a USB memory stick or (more importantly) a wireless keyboard and mouse. I'm currently using an old Logitech keyboard that I had lying around and it works great! It turns the little tablet into a solid substitute for a laptop or netbook. It does, however, drain the tablet's battery more rapidly, but that's something I can live with when I need to do serious work processing.", "Date": "March 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Power issues", "Author": "Puglady", "ReviewID": "R138RGYLS0ZYP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I actually love the tablet considering I had a lot of power issues after about 3 months.  I finally sent in tablet for repair on 10/3/13. The company tells you how to pack the item...with 3 inches of bubble wrap and place in a box but not the original box it comes in.  You are responsible for shipping fees.  After ASUS received the tablet, it doesn't update in the computer for 72 hours.  Finally received an email stating it was shipped and they provided a tracking number but they did not provide the shipping carrier.  On 10/17/13, I received my tablet with a cracked screen. I called ASUS immediately and they were very apologetic.  They provided me with a new RMA number and they also provided a shipping label at their expense. They asked me to email pics of the broken screen which I provided immediately...within an hour of talking to ASUS.  I finally received an email on 11/2/13  stating they acknowledge the receipt of the pictures I emailed to ASUS and that the pictures have been attached to my assigned case (16 days later).  I received an email today 11/8/13 stating that the screen isn't covered under warranty and in order for them to repair I had to pay them $168...seriously. Oh and they provided me with a picture they took of the broken screen.  It's been 36 days and still no tablet.  I will NEVER purchase an ASUS product again.  The company's computer system is messed up...and they sell computers.  It shouldn't take 72 hours to post updates. The people I talked with on the phone are very nice and say they understand my frustration but that doesn't help get my tablet repaired.  The whole process has not been pleasant. I talked to a supervisor with ASUS who told me I had to reply to the mail stating I owed the $168.00.  I wonder how long it will take for them to read it....hopefully not 16 days again.", "Date": "November 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Tablet and Great Price for all the Features.", "Author": "RV", "ReviewID": "R12HPA59OFRL9M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me start by saying i usually do not give reviews because i am to lazy to do so.  This time I had to.The Price for this tablet considering all the features you are getting is amazing.  I have a Galaxy Tab2 7.0 and I love it but it is a small I and wanted something bigger with lots of features but could not affort 500 plus for the big names.  I read the reviews about this tablet before purchase was a little scared about some of the things being pointed out in the reviews.  The camera was a big concern as i read a few reviews that said they have camera issues such as it not working at all.  I bought mine and it is working perfectly.  I tried it several times right out of the box and after installing lots of apps.  I even installed scanner apps and they all work fine the pictures come out great and not one camera issue.  So its possible that there were some tablets that left the factory with less then perfect cameras but Mine works flawlessly.The speed of the unit is great.  I have browsed the internet for 3 hours straight and have had no issues with connection dropping or speed of the connection.  Pages load with no issues unless the website itself was having and issue.The GPS works Flawless also.  I took it in my car and drove all over the place and it kept right up with me no issues.  Keep in mind i was not using the installed navigation program as that requires an internet connection.  I use a GPS app that stores all the maps you need on the unit so that you do not need internet connection and it works great.Video playback is perfect no skipping no pause nothing at all.  Sound is also great.  The reason you feel a slight vibration is that it has a great bass sound to it and Bass will always give you vibration on any speaker big or small.  You only notice it if you are holding the unit and the volume is all the way up.  There is no problems with sound either.  Keep in mind though the set the tablet to the max volume at the factory you have to take into account that depending on how a video or mp3 was recorded the sound level is different on each MP# or video so some are louder and you have to keep that in mind.  With any product you really do not want to run the speakers at full volume to preserve the speakers so that you do not cause damage to them.  But for the size of the speakers on this unit they produce a really great sound.The earphone jack works great also.Videos were no problem as I was able to play and type of video threw at it and played great.  Again using a app that you can download.  There are many apps that you can download that are able to play all video formats.Also no issues with the HDMI out works fine no issues.The microphone picks up really well and very clear. No issuesI will agree with one person that the usb connection on the tablet is hard to connect and you do need to get a feel for it because its very tight and getting in the right way can be tricky and could cause damage if you do not have patience but otherwise works great.  Also agree that the cable that comes with it is a little short but you can always get another cable from amazon for a cheap price just make sure you purchase a quality cable.Battery life is great also.  I have run it for 12 hours before loosing charge and that included watching to full movies each 1.5 hours long.  Also Browsing the internet for 3 hours and lots of installing of apps and file transfers.It came with Android 4.1.1 but soon as you start it up it up and connect to the internet it will download an update then restart.  Then just go back into settings then About Tablet and click on system update and it will download and install Android 4.2.1 Then reboot and you are Running 4.2.1.  It runs super smooth.I have not had any issues installing all my favorite apps that i Run on my other tablets and Phone.  I generally only by Samsung but this product can really hold itself to others no problems.The actual case is not as strong feeling as others but not bad either and it is actually light and not uncomfortable to hold.  The screen brightness is very good and have not had any issues with the brightness and being able to see the screen outside.  I have been able to watch movies from a movie site with no problems in the stream of the audio or video.I have played some demanding games and also it played very well no issues what so ever.Put one of my many 32Gig Micro SD cards into the tablet and reads it fine no issues with read or write.Do note that the manual that comes with it does state that it is not designed to be left on the charge for extended periods of time like others. But long as you are not leaving it on the charger fully charged for very long periods of time it should be fine.  You could always set an alarm to remind you to take it off the charger if you are concerned about that.Like all smart devices it does come with some apps installed already that most people do not want or do not use.  You can always disable them or remove them if you are a little with the os or if you know someone who is.The colors are crisp and clear. (Forgot to mention)Normally would not have looked at this brand or given it much thought but turns out I am really glad i did because it has been worth every penny spent on it.  I do not leave home without it.So my overall on this tablet for the money features and quality its a WIN WIN WIN.", "Date": "April 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Ultimate Tablet machine", "Author": "Wurz", "ReviewID": "R1SCX7IMH6JTID", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had the tablet for a month now, it has been tested during spring break, from car movie player, to in hotel movie entertainment, to work office, and internet browser.I was looking to buy and android tablet and after researching I was buying the TF700 (it was already in the cart and just needed the buy now... however I was a bit reluctant to spend $449) when I saw this brand new version.I am not a fan of the latest, because they tend to be expensive and loose value immediately thereafter. However looking around and comparing the features, you cannot really get anything for that price.The tablet is amazing. It has some limitation but that's supposed to be an entry level tablet...Now what are the limits:1.the processor is limited to 1.2 (vs the 1.7 of the Infinity): well either the tablet has also a nice hybrid engine to give you the best performance or the best power consumption... and if you want to go to the 1.7, just root it and enjoy the same power as the infinity (the processor is exactly the same... If you do that you'll see a decrease in the battery performance and it might get warmer.2.The video is not High resolution (only 1280x800): well I am not missing anything, nor by internet (you tube), nor by playback videos (one of the primiray use is movie playback in the car for my kids for long trips), nor by reader eBooks. 3.Internal memory being only 16GB: besides being well more than needed for the OS and all the Apps you need,if you need more memory just buy a microSD and add as much as you want (just bought a $20 microSD class 10, for all videos, books, an music). take a look on prices differences between pears product between the 16GB, 32GB and 64GB... then you'll be glad ASUS allows you to just add a microSD.4.Speaker vibrates: several people complain a bit about the vibration fo the case when getting some volume: first of all, yes it does vibrate a bit, however, the tablet gets some volume and some good music out of it, and that is the cause of vibrations... ever had a subwoofer in the car? same concept in a little world.Noe let's talk about the rest:1.Price vs quality: I absolutly love the product for the money invested.2.look and weight: WOW, a nice little tablet, weighing less the others and being just as cool looking as others more expensive.3.micro HDMI: just bought a $1.39 cable and now I used it with any TV in hotels, and now in my house to enjoy all my networked access media.... WOW4.micro usb: one of the most common charger adapter, 15ft USB to micro USB cable for less than $3 to being able to set up a charger in my car, or use the nokia cell charger in the office.. anywhere in the house I have those adapters... soo convinient5.Android: Android OS is coming along nice; I am a fan of Linux (yes android is linux based) and Jelly Bean is a nice OS.6.Amazon: I am using Amazon App store to \"buy\" all the Apps I need, even the free ones so they get stored in my cloud space, available to my next tablet. A daily free APP, buy from the PC and leave it in the cloud till you need it. Nice!!!The only and real negatice issue? I bought a case and the screen protector on the 26 of feb, and still have not received it, because they are in the production phase... I should get them first week of April. That's another draw back of buying the latest.That's it folks. If you are looking to buy a nice cheap tablet, go for it...Max", "Date": "March 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Died after 11 days... Replacement dies less than a month later. Buyer beware.........", "Author": "D.K", "ReviewID": "R1D76VYYF9IBW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I must have the worst luck with tablets. I had a HP touchpad which I loved that died a little under two years. Black screen of death but that what you get for buying dead technology. Anyway, I brought a Ipad 3 a few months back and it's ok. But I brought this ASUS memo pad and it was love at first sight for 11 days. It's easy to use and pretty light weight. The only real downside is the speakers. The sound for games is great but when playing a movie not so good because of the location on the back of the tablet.  Even with headphones it's only marginally better.  Anyway back to the problem. On May 31, 2013 a system upgrade to Jelly Bean was performed and it went through fine. On 5 June 2013 the tablet would not turn on. I called ASUS and they walked me through trying to get it to boot, but it to no avail. So this review is from 21 May 2013 - 5 Jun 2013. I will give Amazon high marks for their customer service.  A replacement was sent out and I should get it today.  So to be continued........6/29/13  Update... So I have had the new device for about 20 days now and last night I could not for the life of me get it to turn on. I put it on the charger and kept holding down the power button and finally got it to turn on.  I would recommend against letting the battery completey drain.  I think that is the problem with this tablet.  The last time I had this problem of the black screen of death. The tablet battery had died. Other than that a great tablet for the price.7/3/13 Update..... The replacement died today.  I had it plugged up majority of the day while I was watching Burn Notice.  When I went to turn it back on later that night.  I got the black screen of death.  So it was not a low battery issue.  There is something serious wrong with this tablet.  This is the second one to die in less than two months.  I'm not willing to give Asus a third try.  I'm getting a refund and already brought the Samsung Note.

Awful Customer Service.", "Author": "Martin Shoman", "ReviewID": "R1YMY1EJGR9C05", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this tablet (unfortunately, not from Amazon) 6 weeks ago. It would be a great tablet if it wasn't for the terrible QA of Asus. It has been at Asus repair for 4+ weeks of the 6 I own it. Originally, it would not charge properly and no computer or OS would recognize it when plugged into the USB port. First go-round they replaced the mother board and sent it back to me. The second go-round they are replacing the motherboard again (suspicious?) but the part is out of stock if you can believe that.I requested a replacement for this lemon but they insist they only have to keep repairing it because that is what the warranty states.This is also not true since the warranty state 'Repair or Replace\". The supervisor I spoke with has firmly stated they will never give me a replacement. It is only 6 weeks old and I am sitting here with no tablet.

For some reason it didn't get the 4.2 excellent keyboard that allowed one to swipe around keys. =( I really like that in my GNex.Like most reviewers below, I am quite impressed with what it can do considering the low price. I did a bunch of research comparing it to the older TF300 and premium TF700. While it may not look like much on paper spec wise (same as TF300 but lower spec than TF700), Asus improved upon the useability of the MeMo Pad. Most importantly, the I/O side of things. It no longer lags! Yay! In that respect under real life use the MeMo Pad felt more responsive than previous Asus Tablets. I think they learned a thing or two while producing the Nexus 7.{The Bad}The screen resolution was OK. I prefer higher res. But for normal day to day use, it is fine except. Some small text are a bit garbled. Else photos are fine. Watching HD movies is fine too.The plastic backing while ok, it did exhibit some minute creak. No biggie. I am anal that way.{The Good}This outweighs the above easily. Speakers blew me away. For such a small thing, it produces big sound.Lots of non-proprietary ports (Apple needs to learn here!).

It seems to happen automatically on boot???Well after much research, I speculate that android uses the magnetic sensor to calibrate the gyro and accelerometer on boot.I believe I have a faulty magnetic sensor on the unit.I ordered a replacement from amazon. Received free of charge, same day shipping! Have to drop the old one at UPS in 30 days.The replacement also had the same issue. :(But after fiddling with it for about an hour, it seemed to calibrate itself upon reboot. So now it works fine. Will report back if I have further issues.Your device will undergo two updates when you get it. The first update is to the touchpad (also called digitizer). The touchpad is very bad and doesn't register touch very well at all before the update. The 2nd update is to 4.2.1. (No digitizer issues after the updates)After the 2nd update you need to select 4.2.1 in the settings menu. The fact that ASUS allows you to switch between the two launchers is really nice, but I think you lose 4.2.1 features when using 4.1.1 interface :(Sometimes the gamma is overblown after using some apps but it corrects itself within 30 seconds. I'm not really sure whats going on. It doesnt seem related to brightness as I dont use autobrightness. Kinda odd, but I suspect its the screen going into some \"cinema mode\" or something. The only time this causes a problem is with reading text. But again, oddly it corrects itself sometimes.Sound is AMAZING using the equalizer app that comes from ASUS. The \"gaming\" profile boosts bass A LOT, and shouldn't be used in other situations. The best audio profile I like is \"music\" ... in pretty much all situations including youtube or watching movies.Back facing camera is grainy when set to ISO of 800. (The fact that ASUS camera app gives you ISO control is really nice) I suspect that its a very low budget 5mp camera. But it does the job!Gaming is average. REAL RACING 3 is set to a low quality profile on this. I really don't know why. Using a 3rd party app allows you to bump REAL RACING 3 to extreme settings but its unplayable. \"MEDIUM\" profile is playable. \"HIGH\" is slow FPS but tolerable if you really need those spectators in the stands.

The size and form factor (very thin) is what I would expect and want from a 10\" tablet.  It feels sleek and is very light.  The build quality seems quite good for a device housed in a plastic shell.  The screen is great -- extremely clear and vivid, with an easy-to-access brightness slider control, which you'll want to use, because I've found that screen brightness has a lot to do with how long the battery lasts.  You can turn off the \"auto\" brightness and extend the battery life quite a bit.  Keeping the wireless feature \"on\" will also drain the battery quickly, so I only turn on wireless when I need it, and otherwise turn it off.  Overall, I feel the battery life is good, albeit a bit shorter than I might have expected.  It will last the better part of a full day, even with heavy use.The processor is quick; I've had no issues with download speeds and my kids have had fun playing games on it with no issues.  It hasn't crashed or stalled at all in nearly 4 weeks of fairly regular daily use.The only knock on this tablet is that its wireless antenna seems a bit weak -- my phone can pick up a stable and strong wireless signal throughout my house, on every floor.  This device struggles to find a usable signal if I go to another floor, or if I get more than about 20 feet from our wireless router -- and I have a fairly high-end router.

It will, for some reason, let me copy WMV video files, but WMV files won't play on the Android tablet. I have to work around this by changing the file type extension on my MP4 files to WMV and then copy them. The Android tablet then doesn't seem to care what the file extension is and plays them just fine once I get them there! I worked with Asus support on this and they were unable to provide any solution. I had hoped they would have updated USB drivers for their tablet, but they don't. They have drivers for their \"Transformer\" tablet only. Maybe updated Android USB drivers would have allowed Windows to properly recognize the deviceWhen I connect the tablet to my PC via USB, the Windows file manager shows duplicate entries for the folders on the tablet's SD card. Also, whenever I connect it to my PC without even copying files or doing anything, all of the files in my folders on the SD card are suddenly duplicated! The tablet file manager doesn't show them duplicated, just the Asus player/viewers. The only way I can eliminate the duplicate files is to (using the tablet file manager) create a new folder under a different name, cut & paste all the files to the new folder, then delete the old folder. This duplicate file problem also occurs when an update is applied to one of the apps.Doing a Google search on these problems I have found others have experienced these problms with other devices, including smart phones. It seems that the Android OS has some glitches. No one reported the Windows file copying problem however.I don't have experience with other brand tablets, so I don't know how they compare. But even with the glitches, I still find this tablet to be very useful and worth the price.My experience with Asus support was just so so and not what I would call great.", "Date": "August 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best!!", "Author": "Gary A Helms", "ReviewID": "RIULCSZPUAQ8G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wish I had waited for the 32gb but this tablet is so fast and the graphics are the absolute best.

The price point was incredible. The problem with it is that it is just too bulky. I bought it because I wanted the bigger screen, and thought I would be using it more. I bought the the ASUS tablet because it's small and convenient. I would like to have a bigger screen, but you can't have everything.I love this little tablet. I take it with me everywhere. It's perfect for meetings. I wish I hadn't purchased the notebook. Live and learn.This tablet is very light weight. I also purchased the Folio Keyboard Case which made the overall purchase a little pricey, but a good investment.The price to functionality is very good. The speakers are about what you'd expect for a tablet. The screen is nice. I have a 16gb sd card. I have yet to use the headphones. Adjusting the volume is a little involved if you don't have the keyboard. You have to go  into setting to change the volume. If there is a more direct way, I haven't come across it yet. I think it would be nice to have some volume buttons along the side.Overall a good purchase. I would do it again. If you're looking for an inexpensive (not cheap) tablet, go for it.There is one small issue. The product is solid, but it could be a little more \"solid\" IMO.

I just did not like the kindle fire's 7\" screen and there was considerable lag so I upgraded to this asus 10.1 tablet.  Overall I like the tablet and it feels snappy.  16gb is plenty of storage space for me.  The screen is relatively dim and easily scratchable (I already have a large scratch ~1.3 inches on the screen, luckily it's only on the bezel and not on the visible area).  Some cons are that it's not Gorilla glass and the screen quality is only average.  The battery life is rated at 8hrs but realistically I've only been getting 4-6 hrs with constant use (mostly reading e-books and/or watching online videos).  Adobe flash is available, just install the apk from adobe and you are set.  Asus supernote is pretty cool.  I also like the micro hdmi out as I can connect my tablet to the tv to watch my videos. I don't really like the placement of the power and volume rocker.  The power button is somewhat recessed into the tablet and located in a non-intuitive area.  Also for those that have the tablet, there is a light on the power button that goes from orange to green when it is fully charged.  did not discover this until after a few charges.  The speaker output is fairly loud.  It sometimes does get a little warm on the plastic backing but nothing too bad.

I've had this for over 5 months and I love this. Here's the reason why:1) I am maxed (full 16 gb internal and 16gb Sd card) and still runs efficient. I have movies, music, books, and a lot of apps but it doesn't seem to bother it.2) google play market compatible - great variety of free apps, low cost music and movies before coming out on DVD3) take great rear camera pictures. Quality compared to my iPhone 4 pictures is better. 5megapixels may seem low but perfect for up to 5x7 prints and doesn't take up too much memory.  Front facing not bad when there is a lot of light but grainy when lighting is bad. No flash on rear but doesn't require too much lighting.4) easy to link to wifi first time and automatic if saved. Unlike some electronics, it may say it's locating wifi signal when saved and trying to link. I go from house to house and linking to wifi is seemless that I forget I have to do some work when I go somewhere new.5) even for 10 inches, compact and light. I carry tablet everywhere. So convenient.6) accessories made specific to this tablet. Not mainstream like a samsung galaxy or iPad so not as expensive but not generic where you gamble when you buy accessories. The accessories bought fit perfect. The case and the screen protector do not block any of the buttons, camera or \"outlets\" (charger, headphones, etc)I will review the accessories separately.7) doesn't take an expert to use. I taught my mom how to use and she doesn't even know how to answer a phone call on a smartphone. My 3 year old twin nephews are also able to use no problem.8) able to watch movies from Flixster, Netflix, SD card and Google play. No internet needed, except for Netflix.9) can transfer music from iTunes to this tab with no problems. Also vice versa.10) asus specific apps are interesting.  I don't use the webstorage since I already have google drive, but I like how the asus album and art.I haven't found a negative worth mentioning yet and unless you are a brand name shopper, you will be happy with this purchase. Best 10.1 inch tablet out there for the price. I know a samsung galaxy 10 owner and he said that the tablet is comparable. Only major difference is Hd and the appearance of some icons other than that, he said it actually runs better. I know iPad owners and they were impressed.

I couldn't be happier with this purchase, and I'm delighted that this new ASUS product lives up to and actually exceeds my expectations. The tablet is primarily used when I travel, or as an emergency back-up when my middle-aged desktop is having problems. The response time is plenty fast, and the battery life has exceeded 8 hours with life to spare. It's a bit heavier than my netbook was, but I won't quibble over a few ounces. And the keyboard is a definite improvement over the netbook, as it seems to be close to full size.  My only significant complaint is the miserable documentation that comes with the tablet and with the keyboard. Downloading the manual was pretty much a waste of time. However, information available on the Web and from the reviewers at Amazon filled in most of the blanks, and general information on the care and feeding of Android tablets took care of the rest. For a newbie to this non-Windows world, research time was fairly extensive, but the payoff was worth it. A second complaint is the lack of USB ports on the device, but the purchase of an inexpensive OTG cable to convert the micro USB to a regular sized USB took care of most of my needs. And also, I bought an inexpensive 6 foot cable to use with the charger as the one supplied was too short for many situations. Last complaint is that the light that displays when charging the tablet is obscured when the tablet is in the keyboard case, so I cannot get a quick view of whether the device is yet fully charged.

I took the laptop back & bought the MemoPad. I also got the matching KB/case, an OTG cable & a \"Plugable\" USB powered hub. I'm typing this review using the BT keyboard right now. I have my Logitech USB mouse plugged into the hub & am streaming music from my external USB HDD via BT to my home theater receiver. If I can accomplish all that simultaneously on a tablet, I can definitely live without a PC. All I have to do is pick up a Wifi printer & I'll be set. Sure, it won't play CD's, but I haven't used those in a long time anyway. The best part is I can unplug the OTG cable, close it up & take it with me, as easily as my phone. I don't have to carry the charger or any accessories with me, so it's not cumbersome like my old laptop was. Android hasn't been around as long as the competition, so it still has it's quirks & bugs, but considering the cost & overall convenience, it's worth it for me. So far, mission accomplished.

Unfortunately this review is the latter.  I purchased the MeMo Pad 10 at walmart.com with a protection plan. When I received the tablet it had a small mark near the corner of the screen new out of the box. This mark began to travel several days later and I realized it was a crack. I called Wal-Mart who reported I needed to call ASUS as it occurred prior to delivery. When I called ASUS they told me that they would repair the unit but would assume it was user incurred and I would be charged. I told them this made absolutely no since as I also have a protection plan and would have nothing to gain by lying to them about this issue. They suggested I use the protection plan. I was able to call and explain the whole situation to Wal-Mart who agreed to fix the tablet even though it did not fit the terms of their agreement. I didn't think too much of this until I came across similar reviews about ASUS products including this tablet arriving faulty with cracked glass, nonworking usb ports and so on. This will happen no matter what product you buy but I am surprised to see that the response to these all experiences was: we assume you did it and you will be charged, even after being sent to them by a distributor that sold the product with a protection plan.  I could see this if you call a month after purchase with no protection plan or a customer had some sort of prior incident. I was very lucky to have the protection plan as I almost never buy them.  The tablet itself would receive 5 stars, but as you purchase the customer service as part of the product I wanted others to be aware that you may run into a brick wall with ASUS if your tablet arrives with a defect when shipped. I would try to find one locally that can be inspected prior to purchase or spend the extra $30 bucks for the 2 year protection at Wal-Mart. I myself find this to be very poor service and will consider this in the future when considering ASUS products next to other makers. I have owned other ASUS products and knew they pay attention to detail and made great products but had never needed to contact their service. I guess the days of the customer is always right is gone. Don't even get an I'm sorry you had a problem these days. Makes the consumer feel pretty insignificant. It is likely due to customers that take advantage of companies which is sad but non the less I am disappointed in ASUS.  As for the tablet I couldn't be much happier. Can't find a better deal for a tablet with USB, Micro SD, front and back cameras, GPS, HDMI from a name brand. I don't like being locked into apples products and software offerings, cables and inability to expand memory and this product solves those issues. I purchased a few devices that were much less expensive including the DOPO 10\" tablet but gave up after using their unstable systems that constantly cause crashes. My multitouch screen works flawlessly and the speakers produce sound that really, really surprised me.  The Android system seems to run very stable and I do not get the crashes I did with other devices. The processor has kept up with every game I have thrown at it. For those that want flash it can be side loaded. Just use the browser to search for flash. Find a .apk file, download it and you will be prompted to install. They seem to update frequently which is encouraging. You should have no memory problems with the expandability of sd cards, usb thumb drives and external hard drives. Only real minus in function was all the soft/blurry pictures if not outdoors. I suppose the is the case with most tablets but a flash would really help. It does just about everything I wanted in a tablet and I'm sure much much more. I would highly recommend the tablet itself with the caution of understanding ASUS will likely not be understanding if your product arrives damaged.", "Date": "July 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "This is a great tablet!", "Author": "Jack M.

I already own a Nexus 7 myself and with similar internal specs and os (even though it's not the latest version) I was fairly confident I could show her how to use it in no time.The initial setup of the device went without a hitch.  After a couple of hours in, I tested the Skype app with it.  I couldn't get the video to show, so I did what I did on my nexus 7, I downloaded the camera launcher app on the meMo pad 10.  This is how I got the camera to work on my nexus 7, so I thought it might get it to work here as well.Well, after the call went through, the meMo pad 10 screen turned white and made an extremely loud buzzing noise.  I powered it down just to get it to stop.  After that, I was not able to power it back up.  Also, the tablet was extremely hot, especially near the speakers on the back.  There was a definite burning smell emitting from the tablet.It's a shame because I really wanted to love this device.  I contacted Amazon Support via phone and they walked me through the process of returning the tablet.  The rep was friendly and apologize for the issue and told me that he would send another one out right away and I should receive it in a couple of days.  I hesitated at first, but agreed.After getting off the phone with the rep, I realize that if this happened once, it's could happen again (maybe a slim chance, but I didn't want to risk it).
