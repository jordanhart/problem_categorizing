{"Reviews": [{"Title": "3rd party seller scams. Your NEW Amazon iPad might be USED. Here's how to tell.", "Author": "Reader44", "ReviewID": "R1CLDLMEVLXZUG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The product itself is fantastic and my stars are based on the product being a great deal and a great device.But for anyone thinking of buying from Amazon, be warned. I purchased one of these for someone on her birthday and it was listed as new.  Amazon seems to only sell iPad minis from third party sellers, not from Amazon.com itself, meaning another company gets the iPads from any source they want, sends them to Amazon, and Amazon ships them. One of these sellers listed an iPad mini slightly above retail price, but cheaper than all of the other iPad minis on Amazon. In fact, when I searched for iPad mini, it was the seller and product page the site automatically directed me to. The page indicated it as new, and sold it to me via Amazon.  When my friend got her iPad mini, it looked new, was packaged and sealed like new, but when she turned it on, it was tied to someone else's icloud account. I called apple and gave them the serial number. Sure enough, the item was used, only had about 60 days left in the warranty (instead of 90) and was registered through Apple to a different customer.  If I wanted a used iPad Mini, I would have paid less. Much less.I even emailed the user who had previously owned it (since her email address via iCloud was showing up when my friend tried to access the app store. I emailed the previous user just to make sure it wasn't a stolen product. She explained that she had purchased it a few weeks back from At&T;, not from Amazon. She wanted a wifi + 3g version, not just wifi, so she returned it and somehow, the third party seller got their hands on it and sold it to me as new.In the defense of of the third party seller, once I got their phone number from Amazon and called them (most seller numbers are not on Amazon, you have to call and request a phone number), they provided a scary explanation: They explained that there are problems with Amazon's FBA system (fulfillment). Sometimes, iPads are returned with nothing but index cards in the box and Amazon thinks there is an iPad inside. Sometimes, products mingle, and so another seller's used iPads might be with a different seller's new iPads. They explained that they have a very legitimate source of iPads and have been selling iPads for years and that this is a rare occurrence, although it has happened before. I have no way of verifying any of this, so I can't blame Amazon or the seller. All I can say is that for such a large purchase, and one that is a gift, you are better off buying from a major retail store that doesn't sell used items at all (or buying from Amazon when it is shipped and sold and fulfilled by Amazon).  Right now, this product is actually on sale at Walmart.Amazon refunded me but now my friend has to return her birthday gift. I recommend buying from someone other than Amazon. For this particular product, it's probably the cheaper route to do that anyway. If you do buy from Amazon, call Apple with your Serial Number and verify it is a new, unregistered product with a full 90 day warranty. Don't get scammed.", "Date": "April 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "A phenomenally portable twist on the iPad that finally breaks the mold of 7\" tablets.", "Author": "Scott Showalter", "ReviewID": "R18KRNCDSS963I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Conceived from its sleek, glossy 10\" counterpart, the new iPad Mini boasts one gigantic new trait over the full-sized iPad: the ability to hold it in one hand. This almost revolutionary twist on the device that sparked a frenzy in the tablet world has finally brought joy to those that have held out hope of such higher portability in an iPad for so long. But does the iPad Mini live up to the hype?  Absolutely.Turns out, the iPad mini is indeed more than simply a shrunk-down iPad, though there may be an argument for it actually resembling something more along the lines of a blown-up iPod touch. In any case, the big question: is the iPad mini right for you? I'll endeavor to answer that for you here by taking you hands-on with the new model, plus I'll share from my past few years of iPad ownership experience altogether, especially for those who haven't yet had an iPad to call their own.Plus, in hopes of making this the most helpful iPad mini review on Amazon, I'll also reveal a treasure trove of info on how you can legitimately download tons of quality apps and games for free!For those interested, I've also compiled two iPad listmania lists:Must-Have iPad Accessories: http://www.amazon.com/lm/R1M3AJDBR2BCA7?tag=1pad-20&ie;=UTF8iPad vs. Other Tablets: http://www.amazon.com/lm/R3QLZ307253XU6?tag=1pad-20&ie;=UTF8My reviews tend to run long, so I've organized information by section, with headings, to help you quickly locate any specific info you're after. For example, see the heading \"Downloading Apps and Games\" for the info on obtaining free apps and games!First, let's compare hardware specs between iPad mini and iPad, and what each means for you:+ Device: iPad mini vs. iPad (4th gen)+ Weight: 0.68 lbs vs. 1.44 lbs -- over twice as light as the iPad+ Thickness: 0.28\" (7.2mm) vs. 0.37\" (9.4mm) -- thin as an iPod touch+ Display: 163 vs. 264 pixels per inch -- less-crisp text, but equally long life for a smaller battery+ Resolution: 1024 x 768 vs. 2048 x 1536 -- half as many pixels as the current iPad, but still sharper than an iPad 2+ Battery: 10 hours (16.3 Wh) vs. 10 hours (45 Wh) -- smaller, lighter battery lasts just as long as the iPad+ Processor: A5 (dual core) vs. A6X (dual core with quad core graphics) -- same as the new iPod touch, but not quite as powerful as the latest iPad, yet it doesn't need to be because the iPad mini display totes a quarter as many pixels!+ Price: The iPad mini has a price tag that is indeed much more attractive than the 10\" iPad. It's actually closer to that of the iPod touch.===== First Impression =====At first sight, there's a feeling of novelty to the iPad Mini, especially if you've used a 10\" iPad or tablet. The more you use it, however, the more you realize that this is the size an iPad was meant to be: perfectly portable. The 10\" iPad is so bulky and heavy in comparison, and I felt uncomfortable, embarrassed and awkward taking it with me and using it places, especially waiting in line. Not so with the iPad mini! It's super light, more than half the weight of the 10\" iPad, and its sleek rounded edges are much more comfortable for carrying than the sharply-tapered edges of the iPad.My initial reaction to the unveiling of the iPad mini was one of slight disappointment, mainly because it was closer to 8\" than to the desired 7\" of other tablets in its class. Why would Apple bother bringing a smaller iPad to market that's still not quite as small as some of the other 7\" tablets floating around? Ah, but I was wrong.Until I held it in my own hand, I failed to realize that Apple had made better use of the iPad mini's size than most 7\" tablets do. What matters in a 7\" tablet class isn't the screen size but the actual device size. The iPad mini is 3mm shorter and 7mm wider than the 7\" Kindle Fire HD, yet it touts nearly an inch more of physical screen size.===== Interaction Experience =====Naturally, the iPad mini shares the iPad's same phenomenal multi-touch interface that is undisputedly second to none. Android tablets and other devices may tout \"multi-touch\" support, but usually this just means they support 2-finger gestures like pinch-style zooming. Apple, on the other hand, gives a whole new meaning to the term, supporting up to ten simultaneous touches, and app developers have certainly leveraged that capacity. For example, one popular app supporting ten simultaneous touches is the Piano app.===== So What Can the iPad mini Actually Do? =====Naturally, there are things you can do with the iPad mini right out of the box. You can browse the Web with Safari, set up your email, download your photos and videos from your computer via iTunes, as well as shoot new photos and videos using either of the two built in cameras. You can also surf YouTube via Apple's built-in YouTube app. There's also an iPod built in, so you can listen to your favorite tunes via the Music app, or download new music, movies and media via the iTunes app. Another popular app is iBooks, which lets you download and read e-books on your iPad mini. You can also jot notes, manage your calendar and contacts. You can even chat face-to-face with other Apple-device users via FaceTime.Of course, the fun and usefulness of the iPad mini doesn't stop there. The App Store app is your portal to unending games and utilities. One thing Apple has been really good at is showing off just what you can do with an iPad, and the same goes for the iPad mini. All iPad apps work on the iPad mini. After all, the iPad mini is still an iPad. App developers have undoubtedly been busy creating unique experiences through their iPad apps, most of which have yet to be rivaled by (or ported to) Android and other tablets.When Apple first announced the iPad they didn't tout it so much as an ebook reader as they did a \"netbook killer\" (due to its ability to surf the web, check email, watch videos, listen to music, and do a lot of the simpler tasks that netbooks were originally designed to do. But along its path to success, it sparked a revolution in the publication and delivery of full-color magazines, news and now even ebooks via Apple's iBooks app. Now, it's quite clear that Apple had the goal of a much more comfortable ebook reading experience in mind when they set out to create the iPad mini. You can easily hold it in one hand, just like a real book, and it's as light as a real book, two traits many users have been hoping to see come to fruition soon.On the other hand, to use the iPad mini for more productive purposes, such as editing office documents, you'll need to download Apple's productivity suite iWork, a trilogy of apps including: Pages (word processing), Numbers (spreadsheets) and Keynote (slideshows). Each of the three apps can be downloaded separately for $9.99 each. Completely reworked for the iPad, the complete iWork suite will set you back a whole thirty bucks. So be aware of that before you go ahead and grab the iPad mini for use with work-related document editing, and so forth.Also note that if you do intend to use the iPad for heavy writing or word-processing purposes, you'll find that your ability to type quickly will be greatly inhibited by the virtual keyboard. Thus, you should snag the external keyboard as well (Note: I'll also explain some typing techniques below). Either way, be prepared to pay more than merely the price for the iPad mini alone. There's clearly more than meets the eye if you intend to transform the iPad mini into something a little more productive than it might be for you out of the box.===== Downloading Apps and Games =====Downloading apps on your iPad mini couldn't be easier. Once you set up your iTunes account with a password and credit card (or iTunes gift card), all you need to do is launch the 'App Store' app, browse or search to find the app you want, tap the download button (usually it says the price rather than 'download', which then changes to 'install app' after you tap it), then tap again to confirm. Enter your password, and voila, you just bought an app. Behind the scenes, Apple then charges your card (or deducts from your gift card balance) the amount of the app plus tax, while you're already off enjoying your new purchase. This ease of access is a blessing and a curse, because you can easily empty your wallet if you're not carefully considering each purchase.All apps in the App Store range in price from Free and 99 cents on up, always incrementing in whole dollar amounts (1.99, 2.99, 3.99, etc). The maximum price for an app is set to $999.99, of which there are only eight currently priced so outrageously. And don't even think of toying with them. Apple does not allow refunds on apps you have purchased--all sales are final!Now for the juicy money-saving secrets of the App Store! With the proper resources, you can legitimately download thousands of high quality apps for free. I do it all the time and it's perfectly legal. You see, Apple allows developers to temporarily put their apps on sale (and even drop the price to free). Usually they do this in hopes that you'll write a rave review for the temporarily-free app. The secret to your success here is having the resources to help you spot these special app sales--so you know when and where to get them during these often extremely-limited-time promotions.In hopes of making this the most helpful review on Amazon for the iPad mini, here's how to obtain these special promotional-sale and temporarily-free apps for yourself!There are several resources you can use, both on the Web and on the iPad mini itself. I prefer to use an app called \"AppShopper\" which lists all apps that recently went on sale or dropped to free. You can filter just iPad apps, or show iPhone apps as well, and you can also filter just the free products or just the sale apps. But so many apps go on sale, making it hard to cut through the clutter, which is where AppShopper truly shines: the \"popular\" tab shows only the most popularly downloaded sale apps. If several other people aren't downloading an app, you won't see it listed there! AppShopper is a phenomenal little gem, and it has gotten me tons of apps FREE! It also has a companion website that lists the same apps. You can even create an account and track the apps you own, so you don't end up trying to redownload them if they go on sale again! It also supports watch lists (via your account) with push notifications, and can alert you whenever an app you're interested in goes on sale. It's a real thing of beauty! There are other apps such as AppZappPush, AppSniper, AppAdvice, Apps Gone Free, and more, but none of them leverage the power of the masses to help you filter out the unwanted apps. Feel free to check them out if you like, though!===== Typing on the iPad mini =====Typing on the iPad mini has certainly become a bit less burdensome than with its 10\" iPad counterpart, especially in the way of thumb-typing. However, typing lengthy messages can still be a concern. Obviously, the iPad mini is no laptop--you won't be speed-typing, so it may not be conducive for heavy usage like typing lengthy emails or blogging, let alone writing this review. With that in mind, there are a couple approaches you can try to determine what typing method is right for you. The ideal method might also change depending on where you are and how the iPad is oriented when using it.Typing Method #1: ThumbsThe most flexible approach is to type with your thumbs, which can be done whether sitting or standing. In portrait mode: grasp the bottom of your iPad with your palms facing each other, and your pinky fingers towards you for the iPad to rest on. To stabilize the iPad and prevent it from flopping over and falling out of your hands, stretch both of your index fingers upwards towards the top of the iPad as much as is comfortable. Using your thumbs, hunt & peck the keys on the virtual keyboard to your heart's content.Alternately, if you press and hold the show/hide button on the bottom right corner of the keyboard, you can choose to split the keyboard, which makes it easier for your thumbs to reach all keys. You can also choose to undock the keyboard, which centers it vertically on the screen, instead of at the bottom. Undocked keyboard can be split or merged, per your preferences.Typing Method #2: Two FingersIf thumb-typing isn't your style, try holding the iPad mini in one hand, like a book, and use your index and middle fingers to go back and forth across the virtual keyboard. Alternately, if the iPad mini is resting on a surface and is in landscape orientation, you could try using two fingers from each hand, but I don't think the iPad mini is big enough to type with your full range of fingers like the 10\" iPad is.Typing Method #3: Speech to TextWith iOS 5 and Siri, Apple has brought us an even more convenient way to type, thanks to Siri! Just hit the microphone icon on the lower-left side of the keyboard, and start speaking. In most cases, your words will be transcribed into the currently active text field, with potentially mis-interpreted words underlined in blue. Just select any such word, and a list of possible alternates will pop up for your choosing.You can also speak most punctuation, such as 'period', 'question mark', 'exclamation mark', 'open-paren', 'close-paren', 'hyphen', 'single quote', 'double quote', 'ellipsis' and more. Siri is built into the iOS software and is a free service, but one caveat of using Siri for speech transcription is that you must be connected to the Web at the time of transcription, because Siri is a primarily Web-based service (albeit a free one). At times, network congestion has been known to hinder the ability for this feature to work properly, but that happens much less frequently now and usually only occurs if your device is connected to a poor cellular signal instead of WiFi.Other methods of typing on the iPad include the external keyboard, as well as third party speech-to-text transcription apps like Dragon, but with Siri's voice transcription feature built in, the latter is no longer necessary.===== Web Browsing =====Alongside email, and spending money in the app store, Web browsing is one of Apple's biggest suggestions for using the device. The iPad mini's small stature is no less capable, and its screen resolution of 1024x768 tends to concur, especially in landscape mode. Most websites are around 800-1000 pixels wide, so when the iPad mini is in landscape orientation, Apple's built-in Safari Web browser or Google's downloadable Chrome app will render any sites that are less than 1024 pixels wide at their intended original size, meaning you see them at their true size, rather than seeing a smaller, more compressed version of the site. Chrome lets you keep an unlimited number of browser tabs in the background, while Safari limits you to 9 tabs (at least until iOS 6 is released).The good thing about Web browsing on the iPad and iPad mini is that you can rotate the orientation. Content on the Web was born to be viewed vertically (in portrait orientation), not horizontally (landscape orientation) as most laptops and desktop computers use. In general, I tend to prefer browsing the Web in portrait mode, since web pages are almost always taller than they are wide. Still, even in portrait mode, the iPad mini allows you to see more content at a still-decent size. Of course, even in portrait orientation, the compressed pages rendered are still easily readable without squinting your eyes, which isn't often the case for Web browsing on the iPhone/iPod Touch. Plus, you can always zoom into any section by quickly double tapping any region of the active page. Even zoomed-in regions are displayed with crisp clarity, and the browser's interface is swift and responsive.However, not all your sites will work desirably on the iPad. Apple closed-mindedly refuses to support Adobe Flash on the iPad (as it has with the iPhone/iPod Touch). Flash content is now being used less and less, in favor of newer content technologies like HTML5's canvas and JavaScript effects, which can emulate some of Flash's most familiar capabilities, but sites using Flash do still exist. Flash is often used for advertising, video playback, browser-based online gaming, and for many other interactive site components, from graphs to product demos. However, the Flash experience on tablets that do support it is still quite poor in the interactivity department, especially considering that Adobe never intended for it to be used on touch screens. Thus, certain Flash content may expect a mouse hover and you can't emulate that with a finger on a touch screen.While I found browsing the Web with a 10\" iPad to be a literal pain in the neck, the lightweight and small stature of the iPad mini has certainly improved the experience. It's easier to handle, to hold upright with a single hand while browsing the web with the other, and it's more comfortable to hold. Since I didn't surf much with my 10\" iPad, I have no qualms about the lack of a retina display. I'd rather have this iPad mini with the same resolution as the iPad 2 and a 10-hour battery life with a much smaller batter, than to have an iPad mini with a retina display and either a 4-hour battery life, or a battery as heavy as that of the 10\" iPad!===== Email, IM and Social Networking =====Email on the iPad mini's Mail app is best viewed in landscape mode, as it allows you to see both your list of messages on the left as well as the selected message itself on the right. It also makes managing emails easier, such as moving messages to other folders (or to the trash). Another reason for landscape mode is to make typing those lengthy emails easier (using typing-method #2 mentioned above).You can have multiple email accounts, including Gmail, Yahoo, AOL, MobileMe, Microsoft Exchange and other custom POP3 and IMAP accounts.Important Note: With the growing number of portable web connecting devices, there is one concern I want to express on your behalf. When you close the Mail app, it continues running in the background, even after disconnecting from one WiFi hotspot and reconnecting to another. My concern with this is that if haven't set up your e-mail with a secure connection, and you connect to a public WiFi hotspot that a malicious user is monitoring, then the instant your mail app connects to the hotspot to check your e-mail, your e-mail credentials may be suddenly compromised. To avoid this you definitely want to be using some kind of secure connection for your e-mail if at all possible. Web-based email such as Gmail typically support this out of the box, and Gmail accounts are the easiest to setup on the iPad mini.===== Media =====If you own an iPhone or iPod Touch, it's comforting to know that you audio/video experience will be similar on the iPad mini. You can watch videos via the YouTube app, which has been updated for the iPad mini to show YouTube HD videos beautifully. While the 1024x768 resolution of the iPad mini is a standard 4:3 ratio, not a widescreen 16:9 ratio, the HD videos as well as other video (including downloads from the iTunes store) display just fine, albeit with black bars. Some may not like that though, but I don't see a wide-screen iPad mini coming to market for a while.The Netflix and Hulu+ apps are great for members of those online video streaming services. Netflix videos stream quickly and even moving the play position back and forth in the timeline, the movie starts playing very quick without much time rebuffering the video. For those who want to watch live TV, I also recommend getting yourself a Slingbox and snagging the SlingPlayer app to stream live TV to your iPad mini. I do that, and it works quite well!===== Photos and Video =====The new iPad mini brings a phenomenal new high-quality 5MP camera to market that picks up where the iPad 2's half-megapixel camera left off. 5 lenses inside the aperture, and the more powerful processor, combine to create the sharpest iPad image yet. Even low-light pictures are better than ever, though there's still room for improvement there. There's also a new iPhoto app from Apple that lets you organize, edit and share your photos right on the iPad mini!Plus, you can now record full-HD (1080p) videos, instead of just the previous 720p videos. Though I must warn you, if you plan to shoot a lot of video with the iPad mini, you'll want to go with a 32GB or 64GB model! These incredibly high-quality videos take up an incredibly large amount of storage space!===== E-Reading =====Whether it's books, magazines or news, the iPad is making an impact on the future of media reading on a whole new level. Apple has been under-emphasizing the e-book and e-publication reading capabilities of the iPad to date, but I feel it's one of the iPad mini's greatest strengths, especially with it being about the size of a book. Magazine, newspaper and now book publishers have been jumping onboard the iPad bandwagon by creating their own iBooks and iPad apps, taking their publications to a whole new level, interactively and financially too.My experiences interacting with some of these digital representations of magazines and newspapers have been a breath of fresh air. Being able to read them on a screen simply isn't enough. The ability to still touch them, combined with a rich interactivity on a level that can't be matched by their printed counterparts has really given new life to what I feared was becoming a dying trade. Of course, another big perk for me has been the ability to save space because now I can keep all my magazines around without ever taking up more than the size of a single book.As far as Amazon ebooks go, you're not losing out by passing up on their Kindle line of tablets, because you have full access to Kindle books on the iPad mini via Amazon's Kindle app. If you read a lot outdoors and don't mind reading in shades of gray rather than in full-color, then perhaps the Kindle Paperwhite (not Kindle Fire) is more your style. Kindle uses e-ink which is much easier to read in the sunlight.All in all, the iPad mini is an great e-reader on a whole new level. Had it touted a retina display, text would be slightly more crisp, albeit at the cost of long battery life. I'll take longer battery life over slightly more crisp text any day. Text on the iPad mini looks fine, unless it's really small, and that's usually only the case for an occasional website, but not ebooks.===== Productivity =====Productivity carries numerous definitions. Usually its \"getting something done\" though some people tend to believe that it's the ability to focus without being distracted, which I see as one of the iPad mini's strengths because of its single-app-at-a-time multitasking approach.In the context of software though, applications that allow you to edit office documents are commonly referred to as productivity software. Apple's own suite of productivity apps, collectively called \"iWork\", lets you do just that. For work-minded individuals, it will probably one of the most popular uses of the iPad mini. There are three apps in all: Pages is a word processing app that allows you to create and edit word processing documents, Numbers allows you to create and edit spreadsheets, and Keynote, which lets you create or edit presentations and slideshows (including PowerPoint files). Keynote has been pretty invaluable in giving personal presentations within small groups or one-on-one meetings with an iPad, but I'm not sure the iPad mini would be as comfortable using for presentations.There's also a productivity category in the App Store dedicated to additional apps geared towards helping you be more productive. Remember, any app that works for the iPhone and iPad will run on the iPad mini, but do note that there are some exceptional productivity apps specifically made or updated for the iPad and iPad mini. Some notable iPad-specific productivity apps include Bento (personal organization/information management), Things (project management), iTeleport (remote desktop/VNC), Layers (drawing/painting), and GoodReader (best PDF+ reader around).===== Gaming =====If you're like me, you probably don't have time for games. Ultimately, I still see the iPad as a productivity device more than as a gaming console. Regardless, the iPhone and iPad changed the game on that. Millions of people use their computers for gaming, and with the iPhone and iPod Touch having taken on a clear role as a gaming console that has been as revolutionary for mobile gaming as the Wii was for living-room gaming, it goes without saying that the iPad mini is, and will continue to be, a decent platform for playing games. Most Android games look terrible on tablet-sized screens, but iPad game developers have taken care of iPad users with good quality iPad versions of most iPhone games. Board games and lap-friendly games are better for the 10\" iPad than the iPad mini. Meanwhile, games heavily dependent on device-rotation and other accelerometer-based interaction are much conducive for use on the iPad mini than the 10\" iPad.===== Printing =====Printing with the iPad mini is really hit-or-miss. Apple's iOS 4 brought the ability to print documents from their devices, but there are some caveats. Your printer must support \"AirPrint\" or, if yours doesn't, you might have success using Printopia software, so long as you have a Mac with a shared printer. Search Google for 'AirPrint' or 'Printopia' for more info and printer compatibility. From there, printing is easy, for apps that support it. The first time you attempt to print something, the iPad mini will walk you through the process of locating the printer and setting up the printing options. For more information about printing with your iPad mini, I'll link to some informative off-site pages in the first comment for this review.===== Security =====With portable devices, there should always be some level of concern regarding the safety and protection of your data. The iPad mini delivers surprisingly well in the area--it provides several layers of security to protect your data. You can require complex passcodes to securely access important information, encrypt data whether stored or transferred over WiFi, and even remotely wipe everything from your iPad instantly in the event of theft or loss (with subscription to Apple's MobileMe service). Apple even provides a free device-location service.===== Praise =====+ Clever use of space to cram an 8\" screen into a 7\" class of device that can be held with one hand!+ Apple continues its trend of creating the best multi-touch experience around. Android doesn't even come close.+ High performance 1GHz A5X processor - provides performance power for cutting-edge gaming and multitasking.+ Multitasks like a dream with iOS 5 and the dual-core A5 processor, despite the same 256MB of memory as the third generation touch.+ Rear camera - 5 megapixel photography goodness, plus it can do HD video.+ 4G LTE - It's clearly the next big thing for improving connection speed when away from WiFi+ Supported on Sprint - previous iPads only supported Verizon and AT&T;+ Lower iPad entry price point===== Caveats =====+ No Retina Display - But at the added benefit of a lighter battery that holds its charge just as long.===== Disappointments =====+ No GPS (or assisted GPS with 4G model) - IP based location just doesn't cut it at times. GPS has no subscription fee or contract to use+ No NFC - Near Field Communications is what powers PayPass in credit cards, and there are certainly uses for it in devices, especially for data transfer, if not for making payments or redeeming passes with the Passbook app.+ No 128GB model - would have been useful for high-res videos, or hold more of those 1080p videos you can shoot+ No USB or SD card slot - for storage expansion, or more importantly, for importing pics from your external camera for use with the new iPhoto app+ No numeric character row in keyboard, despite plenty of space on the iPad and iPad mini's screen.===== The Bottom Line =====There's really not much to complain about in an iPad now. Sure, retina display would be nice, but if we'd been given that, we'd be complaining about battery life, heavy weight or performance issues. Meanwhile, the 10\" iPad has its uses, but portability isn't one of its strong suits. The iPad mini now fills that gap, and it's really been a dream to use. If 10\" is comfortable for you, go with an iPad. As for me, the iPad mini has mostly lived up to my tablet desires.Do you really 'need' the retina display? The honest truth is, no. See, Apple has certainly come to spoil us with its latest and greatest hardware, including the retina display, but I really don't see the iPad mini's less phenomenal display as a real deal breaker. I also a believer that the original iPad or iPad 2 are still great devices if you like the 10\" class of tablet, and they don't have the retina display. So, really, why wait around another year for something better to come along? Then again, there's no absolute guarantee that the next iPad mini will even have that retina display.The bottom line is, don't wait around and waste these precious cycles of your life hoping and betting on something better to come around, when you can always buy the current iPad Mini now, enjoy it now, and resell it down the road. Apple products always hold most of their value for a long time, because they're in such high demand.I hope you've found my hands-on review helpful. Feel free to keep the discussion going via the comments! :)", "Date": "December 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Slower at buffering video than my I-pad Retina (and the I-pad 2)", "Author": "D. Fichtner", "ReviewID": "R2QAXZKLNZHPDM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First off, I'm not going to rip this thing apart.  I feel the Mini is an absolutely wonderful form-factor, and I recommend it -- just not yet.The good:The size of the mini is just short of an inch wider than your typical competitor.  You might not think this is much, but seriously, it is.  I absolutely love this aspect of it.  In addition, the Mini is just wonderfully light and easy to hold (I have big hands, though).As much as people rip on the screen, it is comfortably bright, and the battery life seems to last quite well, even if brightened up a bit.  No complaints there.The bad:That same screen, as others have said, suffers from its low resolution.  Had this tablet come out a year ago, it would have been earth-shattering.  Now, when other offerings from Android are coming out with far better resolutions, it's just meh (the Apple Mini's contrast and color are still superior to the Nexus 7 by far, though).  If you are someone coming from an I-pad 2, you won't care about the resolution so much.  For everyone else who is used to I-phones with substantially smaller, yet sharper resolutions, you will notice the difference.Also, and this is a big one for me, I have found that the I-pad Mini is slow to buffer YouTube videos.  I'm pretty sure this has to do with it having half of the Ram of its larger pad family members.  Cutting the Ram in half was a big mistake.  It also seems to cause lags in surfing on only some sites that are more graphic intense.

Bowman", "ReviewID": "R1A9CEFMDUNOVE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm an avid reader and a writer who has tried every portable device under the sun. Smart phones (even the large ones) are too small to read comfortably or to type; laptops simply are not portable enough due to short battery lives; and other tablets were uncomfortably large for me (I've got small hands.) I've tried taking notes directly on screens with a stylus; I've tried Bluetooth keyboards; and I've tried typing directly on screens. Everything was either too large or too small. Other, similarly-sized tablets tend to lag, or the battery life is very poor.I've been an Apple holdout for a while. I had a little iBook a long time ago, and the system issues, general uselessness of the battery, the severe problems with transferring Word, Corel, and other word processing documents, and all-around, irritating, proprietary nature of Mac turned me off for several years. Don't get me started on what I thought of the pricing.After doing a lot of research, however, I took a chance on an iPad mini. It was the perfect size (decent screen, super thin, super light) the battery life is supposedly long (it is--seven hours on the brightest screen setting, several days on standby, 10-12 hours with a low or medium bright screen) extremely portable (very, very important) easy to backup (and from the backup, export to different formats if needed) and does exactly what I need it to do (word processing, graphic art, reading, and surfing.) I have never been happier with an electronic device. (I also use it as an iPod. And as a player for my Google Drive. It's fabulous.)To repeat, it's absolutely perfect for me. I can work on it for hours, it's powerful enough for professional art programs, it's great for writing (the native note app, Google Drive, the Corel app, and a couple of others) and it is by far the best screen for reading I've come across.I tried a Bluetooth keyboard, thinking the screen would be too small to type on. The Bluetooth was a dud--it only worked once--but that was a happy accident. The iPad mini is exactly the right size for me to comfortably type onscreen.I have no complaints with Safari. It's super-fast and while it isn't my favorite search engine ever, it naturally does the job. The only issue I had was figuring out how to open a link in a new tab. (This took me a week. I can be a little slow.)Now that the rave is over, there are a couple of caveats.First, while the screen is the perfect size for me to type on, I'm a small female with hands about 2/3 average size, so it may be too small for some people to comfortably type on.Second, there are (as noted by other reviewers) no USB ports. If you need a lot of memory, this is not the device for you. There is no easy way to expand it. This was actually a little disappointing for me, but Google Drive and Dropbox solved the problem for me. (I'm a lucky person who is never far away from a WiFi signal.)Also, there is no way to replace the battery. When it starts dying, it's done.It doesn't have the retina display that comes with the larger iPads. (It's still a better resolution than many other devices, but hey--no retina display is no retina display.)Finally, there isn't really any way to get around the price. It costs more than some laptops, and certainly more than the other tablets of its size.Personally, I think it's worth it. The sheer portability and quality of the item is incredible. The fact that it is literally perfect for everything I need to do makes it even better--for me.I strongly recommend the iPad mini, with one caveat: do your research. Make absolutely sure you know exactly what you need and what you want, and invest in a product that meets that. This is not the item for someone who needs a lot of onboard memory or a ton of power. Someone who wants just to surf or just an e-reader may be better served with another product, too--but then again, maybe not (like I said, this functions as the most delightful e-reader ever.)I love it, and I think most people will.

Or actually, Amazon did (I think it was fulfilled by Amazon).The Apple ID numbers were covered up by a sticker attached by the re-seller.  I had to carefully peel this back so I could call Apple and get the smut on this particular device (more on that below).  I wanted to make sure that is was not a repackaged, used device, as others have reviewed, or that it was refurbished, or purchased over 30 days ago (and thus ineligble for AppleCare- also reviewed below).  I was able to peel off the sticker without ruining the plastic wrap, which would have made my return 'opened'.A corner of the box was slightly dinged in, and the plastic wrap on the box looked pretty well scuffed up, and definitely gave the appearance that it had been bounced around quite a bit.I did not open the box, as I found out from Apple that this was not actually a brand new device.I looked for but did not find a Mini sold directly by Amazon.  It appears (and an Apple Tech confirmed this) that Amazon does not sell Apple products, instead relying on resellers to take on that onus.  Is this all cause of the Kindle?What impact does that have on us?  In most cases, you will be ineligible for AppleCare. AppleCare is a huge benefit for most purchasers, covering all types of damage up to 2 years.  If you buy an Apple product from someone other than an Apple store, you can still enroll your device in AppleCare, but it must be done within 30 days of purchase, and it must be done at an Apple store.When you purchase an Apple product through Amazon, you are getting a device that in most cases was purchased by someone like us, at a BestBuy, WalMart, Target, etc, at some point in the recent past.  They then 're-sell' the device on Amazon.  Apple uses the origianl date of purchase from the Apple vendor (the BestBuy, Walmart, Target, etc) to start the 30 day AppleCare counter.  In my case, my Mini arrived on the 30th day from original purchase.  I had 3 hours to get my device down to an Apple store, get it enrolled in AppleCare, or else I would be SOL.  Fortunately, Amazon's incredible return policy enabled me to just go online and in a few clicks print out my free return label.As an FYI, Apple stores are the absolute best way to purchase an Apple device.  Not only are they cheaper (mine was actually the same price, with tax, as it was from Amazon), but they will spend over an hour with you getting it set up, linked to your iTunes, your iPhone, iCloud, etc.  It's an amazing experience, and it's all free with your purchase.I challenge Amazon (and Apple) to combine their two excellent companies and develop a strategy for online buying experience that actually enhances each other's products/services, rather than detract from them as they do now.", "Date": "June 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Another used iPad Mini sold as new", "Author": "Robert Fisher", "ReviewID": "R2Z7IM6NCKWAUK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I echo Reader44's review (above) about getting a supposedly new iPad Mini from Amazon that turned out to be used.

I called Verizon back, and another person told me there was a \"problem,\" and I needed to speak with the Fraud Prevention department, which was not open weekends.  Or I could go to a Verizon store and have someone there look at it.  I opted for the latter and drove to the Verizon store in Torrington, CT.  Someone there checked it out, entered some data from the Mini on her computer, and confirmed that the Mini had been previously sold to someone else.  The unit was \"blacklisted\" because that someone had neglected to pay his or her Verizon account.  No, Verizon won't unlock the Mini, so I have to return it to Amazon for a replacement.  Amazon's web site says Freebie Electronics gets 4.9 out of 5 stars, which seems hard to believe if that company makes a habit of providing used electronics to Amazon for sale as new.

My friends said it was pointless but its not. It is physically smaller than the iPad but it has the same excellent quality. Its a lot lighter than the iPad. You may think its to small it's not, the commercials kind of make it look smaller, you get used to the size very easily. The size is very convenient  and it still feels like the full iPad experience.It is fast as well. The camera is nice and the speakers aren't bad like the iPod touches. I actually prefer the size it's not big and bulky, you can take it out in public and feel a lot less awkward than with a real iPad. If you want a tablet for strictly work use maybe the iPad is a better choice, however if you're just going to use it for a work and games, entertainment, photos etc. I definitely recommend it.Display  It has a gorgeous display. It is not retina display but I've compared devices with and with out retina and there is virtually no difference in the display. It also has an awesome battery life. It isn't less than the iPad. Apple really did go back to the very beginning and put a lot of effort into this device. It is much better than the kindle fire. This device's light weight, beautiful display, fast speed, quality speakers and camera, makes it easy to use, take on the go, present, and enjoy!Camera  It has a camera, the pictures are like cell phone pictures, but if the room which you're in is bright and you give it a second to get focused the camera is magnificent, especially outside on a sunny day!Siri  As you probably know this device includes Siri. Siri I often don't use because I'm not in the habit of it. But when I do remind my self it is helpful. Not only is it helpful but to play around without, it has a (specific) response to everything you say. Also I find it really neat that if I'm typing a document I can just press a button and it types what I say, which is wonderful for rough drafts and stuff! This also works if you're searching something etc.Space & Apps  I got the 16 gb version however the space I had available was only about 13gb, which really wasn't too bad, just take in to consideration, that 3 of the gbs  won't be available for use because of what is already installed (no, you cannot delete what is already installed). So, if you're someone who takes lots of videos, photos, plans to make movies, have apps where a lot of data will be contained (iMovie, pages, etc.) Get the 32 gb one, or you can do what I do is take videos and photos, then upload them onto my computer, then delete the data entirely from my iPad, beacause videos and pictures take up a lot of space, however one or two short videos are fine. Just manage your space, but 16 gb is really a fine amount (I'm only at 7).  The apps on apple devices are magnificent, it's not just fun games, there are some for creating documents, educational ones, apps for teachers, photo editing, the Holy Bible! Even medical apps, that give you instructions for medical emergencies or problems, and there is a really neat one on the brain, apps that help you find your iPad if it's lost!  There also is iMovie, if you are unformiliar which it, it is this really neat program that allows you to make movies, it simple, and looks extremely professional it s only $5 in the App Store, so worth the money!  V.S Other Products  Yes, there are cheaper things like the Gooogle Nexus tablet, Samsung Galaxy Note, KINDLE FIRE, and other android tablets/computer tablets, but if you have any i-device (iPod touch, iPod nano, iPhone, etc.) you know the experience is way different than android and for many people way better. It isn't much more, and I know people who have gotten rid of there other tablets (in perfectly good condition) for the iPad mini. And it also had a variety of e-reading apps. And the computer/tablet devices are neat... but $700 more. Besides flash it has all the abilities as computers (refer to \"Space & Apps\"), and for the few flash-involved I'm sure there is a computer somewhere in your house.  In conclusion, this device is wonderful. I've been exposed and experienced with multiple devices, this is still awesome!  In conclusion, this device is amazing.  I switched several people to the iPad mini. Tablets are all made by intelligent people, but this device is made my geniuses. It has, Siri, good speakers, nice camera, very convenient size, for watching movies viewing photos etc, still light, compact, portable.

True, it looks sharper than the iPad 2 at first glance, because the pixels are spread over a considerably smaller screen, but still, when you hold it close at reading distance, you can see the pixels, and the Retina Displays on the other iPads have conditioned me to expect NO pixellation - just sharp, sharp viewing even with nose almost on the screen. If sharper viewing is what you want in a 7\" tablet, you will have to get the Google Nexus 7 or the Kindle HD Fire - Displaymate, which specializes in monitor calibration and reviews, grades both of those competitors higher than the iPad mini. (I will post the link to the Displaymate review in \"Comments.\")But neither the Nexus 7 nor the Kindle HD Fire has perfected the overall \"user experience\" like Apple, or has so many useful, and highly-tuned, Apps.Also, iPad minis are flying off the shelves. Most adults are buying minis for themselve, but a sizeable chunk, like me, are buying them for their kids since they only cost $29 more than the iPod Touch, the previous kids' favorite.Why, if the mini is just shy of perfection and we know (strongly suspect?) that Apple will, indeed, introduce a Retina Display mini next year, is it nevertheless such a big hit this year?Well, first of all, you have to hold it to believe it. It just feels so _right_. The mini is remarkably thin, just like the new iPhone 5 and new iPod Touch (5th gen). This slimness translates into really light weight, and the more squared edges translate into much easier holding. It is considerably bigger, in terms of surface area, than most other 7\" class tablets, but holds just as comfortably in the hand and makes other 7\" class tablets feel clunky and cheap in comparisonApple favored the books and web browsing experiences over movie/tv viewing. The screen is close to 4:3, so 16:9 movies/tv end up being letterboxed. But since the Apple has more square inches of viewing surface than other 7\" class tablets to begin with (the Apple is actually 7.85\" on the diagonal), the net resulting picture is about the same actual size as the \"full screen\" version on other 7\" class tablets.The smaller size with much lighter weight totally changes the viewing/reading experience. Hold it in one hand while you lie in bed and your wrist doesn't feel strained from the weight of a full-sized iPad. With two hands you can view or read for hours, just like on an e-reader.If this had a Retina Display, I'd give it 5 stars, and wish I could give it 6 or 7, it's THAT good.For kids (who read a lot less, and play games a lot more), this IS 5 star, right out of the box. An amazing 10-13 hours of battery life; a good screen, the Apple App universe. It is MUCH better proportioned for kids' smaller hands than the full-sized iPad (which probably feels to their hands like a 12.5\" would feel to us).In terms of hardware, this has the same zippy processor as the iPad 2, but a vastly upgraded camera on both the front and back. The front is now HD FaceTime, the back is 5 megapixels with autofocus (but no flash). It has SIRI. It has 16gb, which should be fine for a lot of \"fat\" video games; the $299 iPod Touch has 32gb, but that is positioned more as a portable media player with emphasis on \"music.\"My 8 y.o. daughter uses this to watch Netflix, watch Amazon Instant Video, do dental surgery (there is a kids App for that? good grief and shades of Little Shop of Horrors!), practice foreign languages, etc., etc., etc. Formerly she borrowed her mom's iPad 2, but she much prefers this, though I can't tell whether that is because it's her \"own\" or because it works better (but she didn't complain that I didn't get her an iPad 2, and that would have cost the same price - iPad 2's were discounted this season, while minis were not).There is a lot of speculation about why Apple didn't come out with a Retina Display on this one out of the box. Here are my thoughts:1. Apple sold a LOT of original iPads and iPad 2s and there wasn't really \"consumer demand\" for the Retina Display on the iPad 3. This was more a technology \"push\" from Apple than a \"must have\" from consumers. As more e-readers transfer their allegiance from reflective \"e-ink\" e-readers to tv-screen style tablets, though, Retina Display or its equivalent is more and more of a \"must have.\"2. Current Retina Display technology on larger devices - above the size of iPhones - calls for really, really bright LED's behind the screen - the \"aperture\" or \"tiny window\" for the pixel is so small on the larger Retina Display screens that you need a stronger light to illuminate it (the transistors have to fit in the same \"cell\" as the display pixel, which is why the \"aperture\" is relatively as well as absolutely smaller). So you need more lights, or larger lights, PLUS a bigger battery to generate all that light. This is why the iPad 3, and even the iPad 4, got heavier, fatter, and ran hotter than the slimmer, cooler iPad 2.- Now there seems to be new screen technology emerging that might solve some of these problems, but apparently the \"yield\" (usable to unusable percentage of production) is very low on the larger versions of these screens (and Apple apparently has a screen shortage even on the lower-tech iPad mini screen).3. In terms of actual usage patterns, some reviewers are reporting they prefer the smaller, lighter iPad mini over the sharper, but larger and heavier, iPad 3 or iPad 4. Yes, they know the screen colors are more accurate on the full-sized iPads, and the screen resolution can't be beat -but what they prefer hauling around is the mini. The mini screen is sharp \"enough.\"4. Early adopters are mostly adults. But based on how my kid has taken to the mini, this is THE computer device the industry has been predicting since the '70's - the computer that will transform education. And, I think, play, at least if you consider it \"transformational\" if kids spend all their game time on a tablet instead of on a Wii or DS etc. Personally, I think there is a real possibility these tablets will change Nintendo into a niche player and drive Sony out of the portable market. I do believe hard-core gamers will stick with  xBox and Playstation, but the market for the mini is potentially much larger than the market for console players. The number of additional kids owning these will more than off-set the number of adults who hold out for a Retina Display. For kids - this is perfect, as is.I am completely fussy, and even I am tempted by the mini. As much as I KNOW Apple will solve the technological and size and weight problems with a mini Retina Display in the near future - in less than a year - I still would like to have one now, because it is so easy to hold and use. I want my kid's iPad mini in a way I NEVER wanted my wife's iPad 2 (I actually preferred the Touch to the iPad 2). It is THE ideal sized cafe/travel tablet/reader, and after spending many, many hours with Android (4.0, 4.1, 4.2) on the MUCH better priced Nexus 7, I STILL prefer the iPad mini.So I can review this - I \"borrowed\" my kid's mini to do so - but I'm going to fight the good fight to resist getting my own.

This is one of those products you really need to pick up and handle to really appreciate.The display is not retina quality, but it's easily better than the iPad 1 or the iPad 2. Colors are good and brightness is good. I really like that they were able to shrink the bevels on the sides, it keeps the mini portable enough to slide in your pocket in a pinch. It's not comfortable in the back pocket of your jeans, but it fits there for short trips or if you need a hand in a hurry.I haven't pushed performance enough yet so it's hard to say where it sets with regards to that. Trying out a few videos I didn't notice any lag or missed frames and the actual UI is smooth and responsive. Because it's screen is lower resolution, you can still play iPad games on it with a good frame rate.Sound is surprisingly good and loud for a product this size. The only downsize to the sound is the fact that the stereo speakers are placed near each other on one of the narrow sides of the device. In cinema/ landscape orientation, the sound is on one side or the other. Even in portrait orientation, the stereo effect is not great. I tend to listen using headphones so I'm not sure it's a huge issue. It's a 3.5 star sound system, great sound, but frustrating placement.The lightning adaptor is a nice upgrade. You do lose access to older accessories, but it's quicker to use than the 30 pin adaptor (or microUSB, but that's another story). Charging is fast, 30 minutes to top it off which is awesome.------Update ------After a few weeks of use, I've only grown to like this more. It's so small, it's easy to tote along everywhere. I've been doing some photo editing on it and it works fairly well, but sometimes when you are trying complex edits or trying to undo a bunch of things in a row there is a bit of lag. I still haven't noticed the lag on video playback some of the other reviewer mention, but again I don't use YouTube very much.------Comparison Shopping ------The iPad mini shines when:* Apps are a priority (in my case, access to a few specific iPad only apps is a big showstopper)* Weight and portability are a important* You want the rear facing camera (The iPad 4G has this too)* You have invested in Apple accessories* Ease of use is a big concern* A solid, well engineered product appeals to youThe iPad 4th gen shines when:* Reading is your biggest use, the retina display is fantastic and the mini doesn't compete.* You want a future proof product; the A6X chip is a scorcher compared to the mini and it is almost certain to be supported longer.* The bigger size is an assetThe Nexus or the Kindle Shine when:* Price is your biggest concern* Nexus has built in GPS and NFC (though navigation is limited unless you get the 3G version)* You are using it exclusively for web surfing, reading PDFs, and watching videos.* Hack-ability and open-ness are important* You are invested in the Google or Amazon's eco-system", "Date": "November 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Often crashes", "Author": "Susan \"Susan\"", "ReviewID": "R151BWXP7YT4A8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I pre ordered my iPad mini and have been using it several weeksI travel a lot.

I've owned every iteration of the iPhone and iPad that's ever come out.  In Black and White.  I wait online and install the system updates (now OTA) the minute they are released.  I tell you this so you will know that I'm really fond of Apple's iOS products.So when the iPad Mini came out, I had to get it to supplement my new, new iPad.  You know what?  It has just not excited me.  It's really not that the 1024x768 resolution is bad, after all, with a smaller screen size, the pixel density increases slightly, but its certainly discernible from the retina display of the new iPads.I just find that the form factor is not so significantly different that I'm amazed and delighted by how much I can do with a smaller device.  Nor am I bowled over by its price.  The stereo speakers are there, but no more noticeably louder than my full-sized iPad with only one speaker.  It's really just there.  In other words, it's more of the same and does not give me the satisfaction of an all-new device.  Now, as I mentioned, I love iOS, and the new betas for iOS 7 will definitely spark some more life into this device, but as I look back and forth between my new, new iPad and my new iPad Mini, all I can do is shrug and say, \"Meh...\"Besides a retina display, what can Apple do to make me espouse the iPad mini as \"magical\"?  It's not hard... I want a louder set of speakers (my wife's 7\" Kindle Fire HD has a booming set of speakers), native apps that not only replace or duplicate the ones on a full size iPad, but rather supplement them so if the two units are together, the functionality increases.  For example, what if any two iPads placed next to each other could extend the screen size?  What if I could place my iPad mini next to my full sized iPad and during Facetime, the iPad mini could show my own face full screen while the large iPad showed the other person's (instead of it being in a little window)?  Finally, they should drop the price by another $50-$75 or, god-forbid, increase the new full sized iPads by $100 to differentiate the price points.Right now, this fanboy is not the world's biggest fan of the iPad mini.  Will I keep it?  Of course, but just until the next one is released.  I have to own each iteration of these devices after all.  However, am I feeling more than just a bit lured by the new Google and Asus tablets...? You'd better believe it.  I'm looking for different, newer, better, more innovative.  One more version, I tell myself... but for the time, I won't recommend an iPad mini if you already own the full-sized iPad.  It's a downgrade.UPDATE: February 2014Now that I also own the iPad Air and Retina iPad Mini, my conclusion is that Apple is starting to fall from grace.  The build quality of the devices continue to be among the industry's very best but innovation seems to have slowed to a near halt.  One more generation of iPhones, iPad and Apple TV for me coming up and if I'm no longer impressed, they will then have lost my business, but more importantly, my brand loyalty.

I have one for taking handwritten notes, organizing my notes, performing sit ups, scanning documents, reading articles, books, and comics, utilizing Google Drive, dating and playing some games. Android devices have many of these features, but not the quantity or quality.The iPad itself performs well. Switching between screens and using the new iOS 7 changes have been fine. Of course, there are some changes I do not like, but that's not particular to this machine. I prefer the mini sized iPad versus the normal size for holding and travel. It's light and doesn't take up much space. The screen is wonderful for reading and takes decent pictures.Overpriced it is, I still think it's a great tablet.

First, I contacted the seller to ask a question and they replied the same day with an answer so 5 stars for communication. Second, the product arrived in it's original box with the serial number of the device matching the packaging, this exceeded my expectation. Accessories were neatly stowed as if they had never been used. I could find no blemishes on the ipad mini, it looked like new. I took it by my local Apple store to have them check it out and they confirmed that it was like new. They were also able to look it up and tell me when it was originally purchased (Nov) and they registered it to me.I've been using the mini for a few weeks now and I love the size for convenience. It's extremely thin and fits in my purse. I had the Nook Tablet before this and find that they are very similar in size. I also have the iPad 3 and for regular use, I prefer the larger screen. I wanted the mini for travel and it will be perfect. Everything I have on my iPad 3 can be put on my mini so when I travel, I have everything I need. I bought the 32 gig and I currently have 7 full length movies and 25 tv episodes (40+ min each) in addition to 130 songs and 84 apps of which 16 are games so it holds quite a bit of entertainment. I have a little over 2 gigs available. My iPad 3 has 64g so I was worried I'd miss the space.The mini feels much more thin and delicate than my iPad 3 and my Nook Tablet. I worry about it breaking and wish LifeProof had a case out for it. In portrait view, the sides are narrow so holding it just there can be precarious. I let it lay on my palm with my thumb on the narrow edge for more support. The screen size is satisfactory and I've had no screen issues while watching movies. Many say if you are used to the retina display then this will disappoint but I don't have that problem. Movies display in wide width with the ability to increase the size to full screen by zoom. Sound is excellent. Alone it is fine on 5-6 level and with other noise, 7-8 is fine. Camera works with ease and seems to have the same functions as my iPad 3 including front facing camera, zoom and video.

It had great reviews & such, so figured it would be a functional tablet. And it probably is for playing games, music and things like that. But it is really lacking as a tool to use in business.The iPad mini, & I have no reason to believe the iPad is any different, comes without an office suite, a way to easily transfer files from a PC unless you use the Cloud or the iTunes Utility, which for security reasons cannot be used in my business, & few apps are without a cost. In this world, people often have multiple platforms at work & home. Even in the app store, there is no direct link to business apps. You must search for everything. With lots of time, searching & frustration at times, the tablet is now functional. I will not go into the lack of multitasking & other small inconveniences.Trying to get a manual for this unit was another treat! You would think it would be included on the desktop as a PDF file. Every Web search to find a User Manual lead you to links to other sites wanting you to download their PDF, Anti Virus or some other tool bar software. When I finally found a manual but it was specific to the iPad even though the internet search said it was a manual for the iPad Mini. Still haven't found anything very specific to the iPad Mini that I own. I will use the iPad with iOS 6 manual and hopefully it covers everything if there are differences. With Android Tablets it is just a matter of searching for the word pdf and the tablet and up comes your manual. Apple has to tie everything into collateral sales by linking with everyone.Paired with a Bluetooth keyboard, it is easy to put in data & I would recommend adding one. I also find a stylus works better than a finger on this tablet. Thankfully I got the 64G mini or would be in trouble since it is not expandable with a Micro SD card. Bad for consumers who have to pay more for this & only good for Apple's bottom line.I could go on about the iOS vs others, etc. but it comes down to having setup & used a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 in a few hours & I saw how easy it was to use, I would never recommend an iPad Mini over the Galaxy Note 10.1 for business use if your business is Windows centric rather than Apple based.

Since I stream movies through Netflix and Amazon I felt it wasn't worth spending more money on extra hard drive space that wasn't going to get used. Games that I usually play on my iPhone work awesome on the Mini mostly due to the larger display. While some might like the bigger screen on the iPad, this one is just a tad smaller (1.8 inches to be exact) which in all honesty is plenty big in my opinion.

There was a decent sale at the time and I decided to go for it and I have not regretted the purchase for one minute.Overall, the features, speed, front and rear camera, etc. are very comparable to its larger counterparts, however it is available in this smaller, more lightweight, compact and easier to carry mini form.

Taking photos with this product is much less awkward looking too than when i see people posing for the full size iPads (I still can't bring myself to do this).

Apple did update the Internet wifi chip and it has the same network card found in iPad 4. iPad mini is fast when it comes to browsing and watching youtube videos etc. I don't see any big of a difference when I play iPad 4 and mini side by side.. Mini is so light and handy,now I barely use iPad 4.

The iPad mini is also great for gaming and watching videos.  I have a larger tablet (10.1) also and this size is just more fun and portable. I accessed my work desktop using Citrix Receiver and it worked great for reading email and other documents and impromptu typing. Sound quality was excellent as usual. The new power connector is easier to plug in. The battery life far exceeds than any other device I own except the Kindle Touch.The things that I thought could use some improvement were few but an annoying few.  WiFi performance is really lacking.  At home, at work and on travel the Wifi is really slow.  App downloads are horribly slow on connections I know to be fast.  I tried connecting at 5G also and it didn't make any improvement. Every once in a while I think the screen jitters.  It would be an artifact from the scree auto-rotating.  I was a little disappointed that it didn't come with some nice Apple earbuds. For the price I would have expected it. The power adapter is yet another Apple-proprietary connector.

Among those tablets were each generation of the larger iPads and even though those tablets kept managed to shed some weight they were still uncomfortable and awkward to hold.  Honestly, they caused me major neck strain and then my wallet started to hurt when I had to make multiple visits to the Chiropractor.So, this brings me to the iPad Mini which, should have been the answer to my problems with the larger iPads.  I'm not going to lie, it did correct the problems with the weight and size issues that much is true but, please allow me to explain the title with more detail below.PERFORMANCEThis is about on par with the iPad 2 or iPad 3 and that's really not surprising given the fact that internals are pretty much Identical to the 2nd Generation iPad 2 in a smaller package.  Overall, it is still pretty fluent and is more than capable of running some good graphics.BATTERY LIFEWell, this is a tough situation because the battery can go 10 hours in a perfect setting but, it can actually be as low as 6 hours under slightly compromising to severe conditions.  This will be explained a little more as we go on but for now, it is about an average performer in this area.CAMERASThe Front Facing Camera is a typical 1.3 MP Camera that pretty much is only used for Video Chat.  It isn't going to win any awards and is about on par with other tablets.The rear facing camera is pretty good but, not going to replace your point and shoot cameras and certainly isn't going to replace your DSLR cameras.  Overall, this is the one major upgrade from the iPad 2 as this camera is significantly better and is the same camera that was in the 3rd Gen iPad.BUILD QUALITYThe build quality is top notch and it is very tight overall.  The finish on the rear is nice and it appears to be pretty resistant to minor falls but, you'll need a case because the finish can scratch very easily.  Still, the build quality is the best part of the Tablet and it is top notch.SCREENOkay, In the larger iPad models, the screen has always been what set it apart from most of the competition.  With the iPad Mini, Apple shrank the screen and figured the increase in resolution would be enough to carry this over to the smaller model...  They were wrong!The display on the iPad Mini has actually been tested and it is one of the worst on a small tablet to hit the market!  I can vouch for this as the reflectance requires you to crank the brightness in well-lit rooms or it is unusable!  On top of that, reading on the tablet leaves the fonts edges smeared and the places where there should be spaces often run together (this makes cl look like a d at times).The power consumption is another issue because, cranking the brightness literally takes 40% of the batter life on any given day!  These are the circumstances where you only get about 6 hours of battery life.Amazon removed my link so I would encourage you to search John Gruber (John's wife says Eww about the display), Zach Epstein, CNET (CNET says to pass on the iPad Mini if you want it for reading, where have I heard that before), and Displaymate (Displaymate shows the reflectance issues, mentions competitions screens being noticeably sharper, and the covers the power issues)  for their views on the screen, I am not the only person who feels this way about the iPad Mini screen.  Marques Brownlee on youtube also compared the Nexus 7 and the iPad Mini and he came to a similar conclusion as well.CONCLUSSIONIf you really want this tablet, look for some type of screen protector that will reduce glare because it really is that bad.  If you're just looking for a smaller tablet that you can use, I recommend the Google Nexus 7 or the Amazon Kindle HD 7\" as the display, performance, and battery life will be far better on those tablets.  If you absolutely want an Apple iPad, grab the 4th Gen 9.7\" Model as it is far superior to the Mini.I personally went with the Nexus 7 and I'll be returning my iPad Mini in short order as it is a highly disappointing product.", "Date": "November 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "I love this iPad, but the specifications could've been so much better.", "Author": "Learna21", "ReviewID": "R13T760E5A0SPU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm not an \"iSheep\", I'm not a total tech person and I don't prefer everything to be Apple, but they really do make premium products, and to be honest, I really like this tablet. It's the perfect size.. it isn't too small or too big. It's so much lighter and so much better looking that my previous ipad 3 which I ended up getting rid of just to get this. I bought this at Best Buy a few days ago and I love it! It runs so smoothly, and I can hold it up for a long time before it strains my wrist. It's so portable, I could carry it anywhere. The charger is less clunky.  The tablet is so smooth.. feels really nice. I like the smaller bezels, it gives so much more space. Why I love the Mini is because it's not too small, but it's not big either. It's almost the perfect reading device. I can also type easily.My biggest obvious complaint is that it has no Retina display. Yes, I know the second one will have Retina, but I really didn't want to wait to replace the heavier iPad 3. And truthfully, the screen's resolution isn't horrible, but it's a much better improvement from the ipad 2. However, looking at the Mini, you will notice text will be blurrier and you will see individual pixels if you are used to Retina. Had it had Retina and better specifications, I would've given it five stars. I can't complain, I chose to buy it. Plus, Apple seems to still be selling their iPad 2 for $399.

When the original iPad came out I purchased it, but later sold it because with having both an iPhone & a MacBook, I couldn't justify having another portable device - but the mini changes this. I absolutely love this smaller design, it is so much lighter & fits in one hand so it is so much easier & enjoyable to use and the way the edges are curved it just fits perfect in the hand. All of the full sized iPads (especially the latest Retina generation) are beautiful & wonderful, but if you're looking for something that's more comfortable in the hand where you don't have to constantly hold it with two hands or rest it against your legs because of the size & weight, the mini is your best bet. I now find that I use my iPad mini ALL THE TIME because it feels so right in my hands. Plus, since it's smaller it's much easier for me to slip in my purse & carry on the go.As with all iPad's I've used, it functions & performs just as beautifully. Of course, the mini doesn't have the power that the full sized iPads have, so if you're wanting to do graphic intensive games or videos, go with the full sized iPad. I have played lots of basic games & constantly stream videos all without a problem, but it may be an issue if you want to do graphic intensive games. I stream video from my iPad to my Apple TV daily (cuts cable!) and I've never had a problem with any lags or graphic problems (unless my wifi goes out...my wifi company is iffy & has been for years, but that's a whole different story).The only thing that would make this iPad mini perfect is if it had a Retina display. I know it is only a matter of time & we will (hopefully) see a retina display on the second generation iPad mini, but I really wish they could have done a retina display the first time around. Switching from my iPhone 5 to the mini I can definitely see a loss in the sharpness of text which is unfortunate since I love using my iPad mini for reading books. It's not a huge deal since everything still looks great & is more than useable (in fact, if you don't have any other Apple products with retina you probably won't know what I'm talking about), but if you're going from a retina display iPhone or iPad you really will notice the loss of quality.Overall, it's a great product & I highly recommend it!

I compare them side by side. The screen & resolution of Mini ipad is the worst as compared to others. After seeing the text on Dell & Samsung tab 8\" (1280x800 resolution), I don't want to read any thing on Mini Ipad ANY MORE. 1280x800 should be the minimal resolution for reading. The text looks nicer, sharper, much easier to read, and importantly, puts much less strain on your eyes. Text on Ipad Mini appears blurry as compared to Dell & Samsung, therefore, is hard to read on such small device.Web searching & emailing & reading experience is best on Dell window tablet b/c it is a regular computer. Android & Ipad can not compare to it. There are many webpages that I can not zoom in & out, & text is too small to read w/o zooming on Ipad Mini. Also, Dell is faster opening the webpages.. Longer screen of Dell & Samsung is better for reading b/c it could include more text in landscape view. But, Ipad Mini is better (to me) to watch video b/c its wider 4:3 screen size produces larger screen view for movie viewing.Pictures & games look good on ALL these three devices.All these 3 devices are beautiful in their own ways and all are light & are comfy to hold. BUT, Mini Ipad is very slippery b/c of its very smooth back side. However, one needs to buy a jacket for it any way. Ipad Mini is wider, so, is harder to hold in one hand (in portray view) AS COMPARED to slimmer Dell & Samsung tablets.No SD card to expand is a HUGE disadvantage for Mini Ipad.No USB port is another HUGE disadvantage for Mini Ipad (one got to pay extra $$$ for a USB adapter).Many basic, common functions for daily use are lacking or are very difficult to use in Ipad Mini, & so, are HUGE disadvantages, i.e: files transfer, video transfer, or documents (words/PDF) transferring & reading/editing .... Even if you pay for doc/Word editing apps, those edited files will not appear like what you make them when you open them on your regular computer/laptop. You don't want to go through few hundreds edited pages to proof read again. How can it be used for school works as people have claimed ?? I'm wondering !!!. I recently found few free apps that allow users to easily perform some of the above functions (transferring & viewing mostly) - this is one of big reasons why I bought Mini Ipad for my kids JUST NOW. Ipad forums show that ALL Ipad users have been suffering this limit for decades ...... . BUT, despite of these facts, & even though after many years, many Ipad fans still SHAMELESSLY deny its limitation, or lie about it, or still blindly defend it - many of them are probably on Apple pay roll, trying to push the sale by lying.One thing that Ipad Mini wins over others is its apps & games. But, Android device is not far behind, and reality is you don't see much difference between them when you look for apps for your daily needs, your daily uses.Also, The cost for Mini Ipad is high for its value at this current time, and is higher than other devices which have many better features. Ipad Mini should be around $200 or less.My kids' relatives have Ipads, and kids like to play games together. Therefore, I have to buy Ipad for them instead of other devices. I buy Dell device for myself.

You will only realize how big a problem this is when you discover how many apps won't work unless they are connected to a cellular network.  Sprint is a big mistake. Should have done more homework because their cheaper data plans don't make up for their network architecture shortcomings.  True enough, the iPad works fine when connected with WiFi, but outside the U.S. WiFi networks remind me of 300 baud modems -- \"you are now connected to the world wide wait\".Another problem with the iPad is the inability to import photos using an Apple supplied SD card reader that plugs into the mini's Lightning port.  Turns out, Apple has got the iPad software so locked down that the card reader won't function with an SD card from anything other than the simplest point and shoot camera.  If you use a good Nikon, Canon or other high end Digital SLR camera that stores jpg files in separate folders you can forget about importing your photos directly into an iPad.

The size is just perfect and the weight is unbelievable. So much so that I didn't even feel the need to rest it on my bedside table to watch the latest episode of homeland. It does everything that the iPad 3 does and it is just more ergonomic. the one and only con is that it does not have the retina display and i might be nitpicking but there is definitely a difference. However, i strongly feel that if you have not used an iPad 3 you will not feel the difference.Would I prefer the retina display over size, the answer is no!

I will not go too much into technical aspects, overall functionality, and capabilities of the ipad mini.  There's a great apple website for that.  I will however tell you why I like the mini for my 3 year old son over the ipad 2.To give full disclosure, we love apple products.  Our family pretty much owns every single iThing that apple makes.  My son's been using an ipod touch practically ever since he was born.  So...a little over a year ago, we upgraded him to an ipad 2, which he absolutely loved.  With apps like Tozzle, Teach me Toddler, and the Toca Boca apps, which kid wouldn't?  My son has learned so much from using the educational apps on a daily basis.  Here's a question for you though...What are 2, 3 and even some year 4 year olds better at than being sponges and quickly learning things?BREAKING THINGSAn ipad is most definitely something most of us can not afford to be broken.  So to protect mine, I bought a OtterBox Defender Series Case with Screen Protector and Stand for the New iPad (4th Generation), iPad 2 and 3 - Black.  Once on, this case is just awesome and protects your ipad like a tank.  But to a 2 year old with slippery fingers, it might as well weigh 50 pounds at that point.  Now that my son is 3, he's gotten used to it and knows to carry it with both hands, but it's still a little heavy and bulky for him.This is where the ipad mini comes into play.  I was a little hesitant at first to pre-order one since it didn't come with a retina display like the 2.  I went ahead and convinced myself that we needed a an upgrade in gigs.  Who knew that 16 gigs on an ipad 2 would not be enough?  I got the 32gig mini in white and setup was a breeze.  I was able to just plug it in and choose the last back up of the ipad 2 for configuration.  It immediately loaded all our favorite apps, songs, pictures, and movies to the mini without hassle.  The look on his face when I handed it to him was just priceless.  He had the biggest smile on his face and his exact wordswere, \"it's a baby ipad.\"He absolutely loves this thing even more.  He's been using it solely for about a week now and has not dropped it once.  We got him the i-Blason ArmorBox Series 2 Layer Hybrid Protection Case For Apple New iPad Mini 7.9 Inch with Kick Stand Kids Friendly (Multi Color) - Blue / White and Ionic Screen Protector Film MATTE (Anti-Glare) for New Apple iPad Mini 7.85 inch / the iPad Mini 7 Inch / built-in Stand for Apple iPad Mini 7.85 inch Latest Generation 4G LTE (3-pack) just in case though.  Even with this case, it's still far lighter than the ipad 2 with the otterbox.  He can now easily carry the \"baby ipad\" from room to room.All in all, the ipad mini is basically an ipad 2 that went on a diet and exercised.  It's smaller, lighter, and faster.  Perfect for your little one at home who's curious about everything.  The Ipod touch was too little for our son, the regular Ipad was too big, the mini...Is just right =) We still kept the ipad 2, cause that is perfect for mommy and daddy.  Hopefully this was helpful for parents.  Please feel free to ask a question or post a comment on this review.

For the year I had it, it traveled everywhere with me and I never saw these as limitations. Unfortunately, this unit was lost during a recent trip to Central Asia, so I decided to upgrade and get one with retina display and 1Gb of memory. Here's the thing: I really don't notice the difference. In fact, all I notice is that it's slightly heavier, slightly thicker, and the battery wears down a bit sooner.

I had toyed with getting a Nexus 7, but the Google Play Store just didn't have enough tablet specific apps. I owned an iPhone so I chose to stay within that ecosystem. The app selection for the iPad/iPad Mini is great. The non-retina display is not a concern for me. The display is still very good looking though. The size and weight feel great in your hands and is a great in-between of a smartphone and a laptop. I particularly like the aluminum back. It's cold to the touch when you first start using it, but then adapts to your hand temperature. It's solid hardware and feels very premium.Cons:Speaking of premium, the price. When I bought the iPad Mini in 2012, it was $330 and the processor was already a year behind at that point. The price point as of late 2013 is $299, with the new iPad Mini at a whopping $399. The hundred dollar difference between the 7.9 inch iPad Mini and the 9.7 inch iPad Air makes it difficult to decide. Especially since the new Nexus 7 is only $230 and Amazon Kindle Fire at $139. The processor is still OK, but it can lag on graphic intensive games. If you don't play much of those, you'll be fine. Movies, Youtube, etc all play extremely well.Rating: 5 out of 5.Recommended: Yes.

I have a lot of material in PDF and I wanted to have a good tablet to read on, this is a really awesome tablet for doing that. About the screen, is true, is not a retina display but it doesn't suck at all you can do reading and everything you want to without any kind of issue because of the screen resolution. The apple integrated apps for doing reading and other stuff are really great, the iBook app is awesome for reading PDF you don't need to download anything else is right out of the box. The only problem that I had is that I own a Galaxy SIII and is really shocking how closed an limited you feel when you go from android to iOS, the system is not open at all, is like apple already limited the user to use the tablet the way they want you to use it and not the way you want to use it, you cannot download any material (music, videos, etc) directly from the internet, if u want to do that u can download it from your computer and transfer it to your ipad using itunes. EVERYTHING you want to do you have to doing from itunes, that's the downside. On the other hand the tablet is simply beautiful, super light, super well constructed, super comfortable to use I can't get tired of using it.", "Date": "February 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Espectacular", "Author": "Patricio", "ReviewID": "R11WEGHPYDW8CW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "El iPad Mini me parece espectacular, muy intuitiva, con el tama\u00f1o exacto com para leer mientras viajo, la pantalla perfecta para navegar en internet.Lo recomiendo, sobre todo para las personas que viajan.", "Date": "February 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love!!!", "Author": "cmdoz", "ReviewID": "R39MJD1VQURGZF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The only issue I've found is the battery doesn't last as long as I'd hoped!

I had heard about the iPad mini and decided to go to a store to look at one. After picking it up for the first time, I was sold. It is incredibly light! It just felt so much less bulky than any other iPad I'd had and bonus for the first time ever I can just slip it in my purse instead of having to have a bigger messenger bag on days when I wanted to take my iPad out with me.As for versus the high resolution displays, to be honest I have an anti-glare screen protector on all of my iPad so at the end of the day it makes no difference. I can watch a movie or read a book or send and email quite comfortably. To me this is what I never knew I always wanted in my iPad, and I do just love it.As for the price, I do think it should have been price 10% lower to give it the solid under $300 mark on the 16GB. For me though I like iOS, I've tried android and it just wasn't for me. Android devices in many cases are also quality but at the end of the day I always say try both and figure out what you like best.

I loved it mainly because I could download all these wonderful syntheziers, and music applications. I would occassionally use it at a restaurant when eating dinner, or while waiting at the DMV or soemthing like that. Sometimes it came in handy at home if I didn't want to turn on my computer and watch youtube videos. But this is not an iPad 2 review, sorry. But I was not using that much because it was heavy, and bulky. I would put it in my backpack, and after awhile that would get old. So I wanted to get this smaller tablet, which is really what I wanted to begin with.Immediately after trying it, I realised I had made a good move of selling my iPad 2. It was a joy to use, and I found myself enjoying configuring it, and downloading apps just like the old days when I would configure my old computers. I have at least tripled the amount of time using it, because it's so handy.Now there are some slight compatibility issues with apps designed for iPad. Mainly they have to do with not being able to read the really fine print on some of the synthesizer apps. Once I figure out what those virtual knobs and buttons are for it's not a problem. Sometimes it will be difficult to tap on a really small button. Hopefully developers will quickly adopt and come up with iPad mini optimized apps, but that's not really a big deal, I just need glasses, and a stylus. I think it would be a good idea for Apple to sell a stylus with it at a discount to make up for this slight inconvenience.The display looks nicer, because I believe it's more pixels per square inch, so scrunching all those images down makes it look like a high end 7\" tablet. Also I'm glad they made it this size, that's well thought out. If it were a smaller 7\" tablet it would be too difficult to use. At 7.8 inches or so it's perfect. I would not recommend everyone going out and selling your iPad 2 to get this, but if you don't have an iPad yet, and are looking for something more affordable, or more compact than an iPad 2, or iPad 3 etc, then this is a great option to have. I'm not sure how many of these have sold, but I would not be surprised if it were a hit, and a retina version came out. As far as improvements that they could make, I am mainly interested in a faster CPU, and a MicroSD slot.  Also, I had some accessories like the Line 6 Mobilekeys 25 keyboard that used the old 30 pin cord. So I will have to buy an adapter. That is one thing that kind of bothers me about Apple is hidden costs like that. But I love it!", "Date": "January 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "I know the iPad very well before I decided to buy.

I edited it a bit:  First of all I would like to thank all of those people who wrote the reviews that guided me to find the perfect tablet:) I had changed my mind many a times, first from android then to Apple's iPad 2,etc... But finally, I was sold on an Android. Asus Tf300. It was perfect, it had a big screen, fluid and responsive. It would be perfect for my note taking as a student. It was light, and had a secure rubbery back. Wonderful! But then......  (Insert dramatic Phantom of the Opera piano playing. Horrified gasps! Scream! Get the smelling salts! Faint! Oh no!) Well, here is where my review gets useful, hopefully. My mom suggested that I reconsider the iPad mini. She felt it was the best size for me to be transporting to my classes.  First of all, I bought it direct from Apple with engraving. When we purchased it right before Christmas, Apple seemed to have the lowest price at $329 for the most basic model. I got a white, 16gb iPad mini. I also bought it with the smart cover, which is overly priced. However,it really is ingenious and it folds into a stand that I use while reading an e-book. I absolutely loved the device at first sight! It is fluid, I love the screen etc...! I know I have no experience on Retina anything, but the screen really is pretty good!(but you might notice some pixilation on white screens or when you're reading, but it really doesn't bother me.) I really like reading on it on the NOOK reader/app.(I know some of you like the Kindle. I just got the NOOK app because for Christmas I recieved a $25 Barns&Noble; gift card.)Over all, I absolutely love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love it!!!!!!! I am sorry if this did not help you at all.I see you going \"wack-o\"! Don't deny it.[Mother's note: The screen is large enough to comfortably view/edit photos and videos. The screen is the size of a paper back book page. The photo quality is better than expected. It feels and looks like a high quality product. Our elderly,yet hip, neighbor is so impressed, she's going to buy one instead of getting a laptop. If you have an iPhone you will easily know how to opperate this device.

I wanted something easy to carry and put away; the iPad just seemed a bit too large. I eventually gave in to an Android tablet and Enjoyed it to an extent but it became clunky and cluttered. The quality felt a bit too plasticky as well.Then Apple announced the iPad Mini and I was ready to give it a try. THIS DEVICE ROCKS!

I was so excited to get it, I pre-ordered in advance so I could have release day delivery. And for the next several months, I loved it. The screen was beautiful. However I had a few scares with it.The first issue I had with the Kindle was on a few occasions, it just didn't turn on. After discovering how to do a hard-reset, I was able to get it back up and running, and just did this whenever it wouldn't turn on again. Then one day while I was playing music on it via the iHeartRadio application, it started to overheat (wasn't aware that the Kindle even could overheat) and after the music that was playing started skipping, it froze up. I picked it up and found the back near the battery hot to the touch. It would not turn off, so I did a hard reset (as suggested by Amazon). After that, it never turned back on. Thankfully, Amazon quickly replaced my Kindle Fire (for free) and when I received my new one, everything was back to normal. However by this time, I had gotten my first iPhone (4s). I was surprised how much faster the internet browser and applications ran on my small phone, compared to the Kindle Fire. So I ended up using my iPhone more often than my Kindle.On month after Amazon replaced my 1st generation Kindle Fire, they released the new line of Kindles. I almost ordered one of the new HD ones, but decided to wait and see how the reviews compared to this iPad mini, which was released around the same time.Now months later, I'm hearing reports from people who did order the new Kindle Fire HD that they too are running into problems here and there with this new version. After doing a lot of research, I discovered that statistically, Apple products have fewer claims for warranty work than other brands. I'm by no means an Apple-Fangirl, and prefer to use Windows PC's in my own home. But I hate having my brand new items break down, even if they are covered by a warranty. When I spend hundreds on something, I just want it to work, and would rather never need to know how how good a warranty is or not. So the statistics of the Apple products having better reliability was the deciding factor.When comparing the Kindle Fire to the iPad mini, I will say that Kindle (especially the new ones) have a more vivid screen. The Kindle screens are beautiful and the colors are amazing. However that's where the majority of the advantages over the Mini ended for me. The iPad mini has nice web browser, the applications work well (less crashing issues), the wireless connection is fast and I didn't have any sort of lag between turning on my Mini and getting online, like I often did with my Kindle. The mini has been everything I hoped it would be, and I love the size.The iPad mini is super thin. So thin, I actually worry at times it's too slim. It's such a nice piece of hardware, I tend to worry that the ultra slim design might make it too delicate. Thankfully, they make cases like the OtterBox Defender Series Hybrid Case for iPad Mini for people like myself who want to put the delicate Mini into a super duty case. I'm glad I did, since it's taken a tumble or two in the last month I've owned it, and inside the case it stays unharmed.I do love the small size of the Mini. I needed something smaller than the large iPad, but also needed something larger than my iPhone. Something that would fit into my handbag, but that I could also easily read, check and reply to my email on. The screen is very responsive and the speakers produce nice sound, better than the iPhone's. The Mini is perfect for me, and I'm so glad decided on it. Everything works just as well or better than I had hopped for, and I've passed my Kindle Fire down to my pre-teen daughter, who loves it.", "Date": "May 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Small but powerful", "Author": "Leonardo Dugarte", "ReviewID": "R2MUZQGQ6271RJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Talk about Apple products is to talk about excellence, innovation, design, simplicity, utility.

I did not purchase the iPad with a data plan, but, wow, this baby is on the money!  I, also have the Kindle Fire, but will continue to use both of them, but for different reasons.Internet connection is fast when in hotspot.  Color, while not retina display, is gorgeous.  It is the size of a paperback, so, it is portable.  And, of course, the apps!!  The scary thing is that it is SO THIN that it appears to be as delicate as your finest china.  I made sure to purchase a protective cover for it. And, it is just SO CUTE!! I dressed it up immediately in some skin and the Otterbox is on the way.The difference between the Fire and the mini are apples and oranges.  There is a benefit and a use for both of them, I believe.  I WILL continue to use BOTH.  But, if you want the diamonds in a small package, the mini can do the job of both.**Update 5/21/13**This has now taken the place of my Kindle Fire HD; in fact, I purchased a second Mini just for that purpose and to hold minor things I would use at work.  Funny, it was a sad occasion for me to make that decision, because the Fire was my designated ereader.  However, a few things made this a no brainer for me.1.  Once my job got WiFi, I started to use my Kindle Fire to watch my Amazon Prime television shows.  It kept stopping and starting because it could not keep up with the router (as the message said).  When I downloaded the Amazon Prime App on my iPad Mini, the show was flawless.2.  The Kindle App on my Mini allowed choices of highlight colors:  pink, blue, purple, green.  Fire HD, only yellow.3.  I can personalize the Mini with any wallpaper I want4.  Switching from portrait to landscape while reading does not create jerking.5.

At 7 inches it is larger than the other devices at comparable size.  The UI is thebest by far the best of the bunch.  The customer service that I received by Apple was hands down the best customer service I've ever received from any company ever during my 54years of living.  The Apple employees were friendly, helpful, took time with me, answered my ignorant questions without making me feel dumb and the employees were just incredible.I had problem and called Apple support.  They worked with me and resolved the problem.  It was a few days later that I got a call from Tim Cook's assistant.  Yes, fromthe CEO of Apple.  He said he was aware I had a problem and wanted to know if it was fixed.  He said Tim had told him to call me and see if I was still having the problem.  I'venever had that from any other company.  I was extremely impressed that someone at that level would take the time over my problem.

It's also been supremely useful as a mobile tether when I've needed to work while out.

I.O.S 7 is fast, it's completely changed Apple's look. It's got new backgrounds that move. The only problem is it takes 3.1 GB.  Next the Ipad Mini (I think) is better than the Ipad 3 and 4 gen.

However, after using it, I have changed my mind. The size is what truly changed my mind. The fact that it's smaller seemed cute at first, and then extremely useful once I started carrying it around. I used to carry my iPad 2 in my purse and it made it extremely bulky. I can't even tell that the iPad Mini is in my purse. Holding it is not as \"cumbersome\" as a full sized iPad. It feels very nice in your hand, though I can't fully use it with one hand as Apple advertised. But, I can hold it much easier than the iPad 2. The image quality is not that of the iPad with Retina Display. But I don't really need a retina display on my iPad, and I can't imagine that everyone else does.I use my iPad primarily for graduate school, and I can see this coming in extremely handy. I keep all of my textbooks on the iPad and take notes on it as well. I watch lectures on it, write papers on it, among other things.

I currently have the iPhone 5 so I decide, after a lot of research. to go with the iPad Mini. After giving it a full charge I started running it thru its paces, registering and getting all my favorite Apps loaded. Then I started to notice that I was losing battery very quickly. An average of 1% every 2 minutes. So I went into settings and did all the tricks; lower brightness, turned off notifications, manual email receive, etc.. Even though it did improve slightly it was not dramatic. I was also noticing that it was slow and had quite a bit of lag compared to my iPhone 5. I ran some video and it was constantly buffering. So I did some speed test across my WiFi and found it was running at about half the speed of my iPhone 5 and laptop. So I decided to do a hard reset,  bleed the battery to zero, then charge it to 100% and then reload everything. Well the charging took forever but I figured this was the first time to zero and back so I'll give it a chance. I started loading it back and had all the same issues. Bummer. So I opened a case with Apple. They are excellent BTW. After the basic testing and trouble shooting Apple decided that they would start by replacing the battery. But I decided rather than continuing to put in a lot of extra time trying to get this unit to work for me I would just return it. Amazon was great with the return process. I give them 5 stars. Apple support was great. I give them 5 stars. My particular iPad Mini. 1 star. Hopefully it was just a fluke bad unit.", "Date": "June 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Shameless cash grab device from Apple", "Author": "Irish-Mike", "ReviewID": "RLPYS4SUKDXP2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Okay, I was a huge apple fan for many years.  In spite of their walled garden mentality, I've always felt that Apple was the best money could buy.  However, I've slowly soured on Apple's business model.  The Ipad mini is nothing more than a miniturazed ipad 2.  The interals with exception of the camera arer exactly the same.  So, when one looks at what he/she is paying for it's outdated 2 year old technology.  This device was outdated and obsolete, before it even hit store shelves.  What does this mean for the consumer?  It means that as soon as the new Retina Mini comes out with 2gigs of ram, you will likely need to upgrade.  Let's consider here that apple has a history of forced obsolescence.  This means they can and often do abandon a previous generations product, when the new one comes out.  An example of this can be seen in the Ipad 1.  The first gen Ipad arrived in April of 2010.  In November of 2012, Apple stopped supporting it with the latest ios update, after ios 5.  This means that customers that purchased the 64 gig cellular model for over $850.00 now have an overpriced paperweight...but at least we still have the beautiful logo to admire.  When apple first introduced the Ipad, the company promoted it as a virtual replacement to the laptop and while I never really subscribed to this notion, I do feel as though at nearly a $1000 dollar expense, this should buy me a lot more than a shade over 2 years before the company forces the customer to upgrade, or be left behind.  Now, there will be those that say, \"Apple doesn't force you to do anything.\"  I beg to differ.  Yes, they indeed do.  Outside of music purchases in Itunes, do I as a consumer have the right to use my digitally purchased content on a non apple device?  The answer is no.  So, if I choose not to upgrade my old ipad, my content is locked tight in Itunes and I have no means to access it.  This is the nature of a \"walled garden\" and I as a consumer understand this.  But when apple supporters buy in to this(at a high price point I might add) we receive no assurances that our purchase has a shelf life of greater than a couple years at best, or 6 months at worst.  See again, those who purchased an ipad 3 only to be surprised by the quick release of the 4.  By the way, Apple no longer manufactures the 3.  So if you have problems with it, you have to pay for the cost of repairs at this point or purchase a 4.  It's just a matter of time before consumers of the Ipad 3 begin to feel the very same pain of those who puchased a first gen Ipad.My biggest issue with the mini?  The price.  Come on apple...The ipad Mini cost by most accounts $112 dollars to make and is sold at a starting price of $329...Give me a break.  As we go up in storage capacity, it will cost us no less than $100 dollars...this is pure lunacy.  I am no fanboy of any brand, but if we look at Google and Amazon's investment in cloud storage, we begin to see how rediculous it is to pay for onboard storage.  Apple's Icloud is nothing more than a sync service; it is not a true cloud based service.  Apple has no insentive to invest in true cloud service because to do so would hurt their bottom line, because they would not be able to charge the consumer for extra storage, as the cloud eliminates this need, for the most part.  The cloud is the biggest threat to Apple's business model and would surely drive profit margins down even further than they are already.  Please understand I am not an apple hater; but I am simply no longer a blind consumer and am informed enough to see that in this case, apple is successfully marketing and selling repackaged crap in a smaller bag...but again, at least we still get the nice apple logo, which of course comforts us and helps us to reaffirm our fabulous purchase of a brand new old idevice.", "Date": "May 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "High price for two year old shrunken down iPad2 specs", "Author": "GoTheDistance", "ReviewID": "R3K8TNK6XWSSUN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Demo'd this in person and my conclusion is Apple is charging a premium for nearly two year old iPad2 specs with a low-end low-resolution display.

I can say from experience, as I have all of the three other items as well ... It is not fair to classify this item as either.Yes, it is true it is an intermediate size in between the 4-5 inch Touch-Phone and the 9 inch Pad. But with exception to certain other characteristics, it is for a class of its own. The pod/phone can't really be considered feasible for VIDEO Entertainment. For that the PAD is the only really feasible unit.Now, if I already have the big pad, why would I go for the mini as well, ... In summary .... Portability .... Plain and simple. I take it and stick it in my back or side pocket of the 24-7's or the inner pocket of a jacket .... And it is like unnoticeable. That's one thing I couldn't do with my regular IPad.Would I prefer the mini to the regular ... For communications and browsing and book reading ( for which I consider the 4/5 inch Pod and Phone way too small) sure, it is fine. But I still hold on to my IPad 2 for video entertainment, because, as Jobs put it, \"for that purpose, anything less than a 10\" unit is too small.\".For regular users, I suggest a SCREEN PROTECTOR, and a HARD CASE, preferably with screen cover as well.But in summary, a highly recommended item...

I am an AT&T; rep who has ample time to use the mini and formulate an opinion about it.  Simply put the screen is garbage.  \"Every inch an iPad,\" is Apples tag line for the device and I must say, no, it's not.  The iPad I'm using has a truly beautiful screen, that only until recently has been able to compete with.  The mini does not.  Now this is what's true about Apple.  They do not care about the end user.  They don't.  Or else ere would be A RETINA DISPLAY ON THE IPAD MINI.  If they can put it Retina on their phone and their full size iPad then seriously. The second generation will have it for sure, by why make their very loyal and sometimes crazy customer base go through with this?  I guess it's because they can.

There are so many tablets to pick from. There are tablets by Apple, Microsoft, Samsung, Nexus, Windows, etc. There are so many different choices, so many different brands. Every single tablet is different. But what tablet is better? How do you know which one to buy? Some like Window products other like Apple products more. Each and every single person is different but there is one iPad that fits all. I believe the iPad Mini is probably the best choice of all, it perfect for everyone. Why should you buy the Apple iPad mini? Well Apple is a very well known company all across the globe. They have created some of the best computers, laptops, created the iPod and the iPhone. Who does not love Apple products? They have the best and most advanced technology. Apple does not let you down, it meets all the expectations, and you will be surprised with what you can do with their products. Mostly everyone has an Apple product these days; personally in my family we own eight Apple products, in which the iPad mini is one. We are very happy with all our Apple products from our laptop and PC to our iPods and iPad. We can say that Apple has not let us down with any of their products we have bought and I know probably many out there agree with us. Why is the iPad mini perfect? First of all the iPad mini is the perfect size, it is not bulky at all. It is only 5.28 inches by 7.87 inches and it is 0.28 inches thick. It can easily be carried in your purse or in you backpack and it won't weigh anything at all. It is also perfect for all college students out there, you can easily take notes with the iPad mini and will never have to worry about forgetting or buying a notebook, so the iPad mini helps you save trees. The iPad mini is also perfect for your children; you can download games, TV shows, or movies. Its perfect for them to use any day, and very perfect for when going on a road trip you can play a movie, give them headphones and make it a peaceful ride where your child wont be bored and start bothering you. The iPad mini is perfect for anyone out there, no matter what it needs to be used for. The iPad mini also has a great camera, which takes very nice pictures. And iPad minis are also starting to be used in schools, which as you can see iPad minis are starting to be used mostly everywhere, why not have one of your own. The iPad mini will make you happier. You can download movies, books, its also can have Wi-Fi. Having an iPad mini will make you very happy, you don't have to carry around bulky books anymore, and you can easily download more then one book on your mini iPad. The iPad mini changes your life, it makes you more modern, and you become more technological. The whole world is becoming more technological, might as well buy an iPad mini and keep up. In conclusion, I believe the iPad mini is the best choice of table. Its produced by a very well known company all around the world. It has the latest technology and it fits all your needs and your families. The iPad mini is very family oriented its perfect for your toddlers to your college students. It perfect for everyday use, for school, and for work. Everyone should have an iPad mini its perfect", "Date": "September 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Over priced", "Author": "Donald Paladin \"Sunergos\"", "ReviewID": "RCASEDPHKZOYB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Apple does it AGAIN!

It reads like a trade paperback in its vertical position. I have read plenty of ebooks on my ipad using ibooks but this puts the ipad inthe shade ebook wise.Second, I have always carried my ipad with me in my purse no matter where I am going. I have now changed this to my ipad mini going along in my purse instead. This gives me access to everything at a perfect, portable size.  I do not need to wear reading glasses to use it.  I find the iphone too small to solely carry that around. Although I prefer going online with my ipad, the mini is perfect for this in carrying around mode.Likewise, I play scrabble, gin rummy and do crosswords on he mini now.  I used to solely use the ipad for this. The reduction in size causes no problems and I can again skip glasses. I am almost 65 so this is a factor for anyone in my age group.I also use the mini now for all of my podcasts.  I love NPR, the New Yorker, the NYTimes, etc., podcasts and mini is perfect for all of those.  It is ideal for both audio and visual podcasts. While I still prefer watching films on my ipad due to the larger screen size, the ipad mini is fine for videos where detail is not as important.I am also now loading different apps onto my mini from what I load onto my ipad. Musical audio visual apps such as Jack White's and Brian Eno's just went onto it as well as several art based apps. Increasingly I am devoting my ipads to films and tv.  I no longer own tv sets, finding the apple products all I need for full audio visual.I use keynote and pages of all of these systems.  Probably the ipad is still my favorite size with those programs but the mini performs very well with them.On a daily basis I am still discovering more and more with the mini.  I am sure I have many discoveries yet to make. But even with only this much discovered, I already love it and highly recommend it.I bought mine online at the apple store.  I got it cheaper than this so you may want to check it out there as well as here.

So, I am quite familiar with their products.  The mini is for my daughter for X-MAS and I have downloaded the apps for her setting it up.In a nutsheel, the mini is a must buy at a very fair price of $330 considering what you are getting which is the best tablet made in this size range (simply put).For the Apple haters who love to comment on Apple products although choosing not to own them, you cannot run stat for stat because of the IOS is not made for multiple vendors thus it is way more efficient.  And, the image on the IPAD supercedes anything out there just because of color saturation.  Look at users comparisons on You Tube. I have a close friend with a Nexus 7.

I've used Apple and Android cell phones, tablets, windows and apple Computers and (Linux). I'm very pleased with my purchase of the iPad Mini, It's everything I wanted and nothing I didn't. It's cheaper then the full sized one, it's smaller, it's easy to hold, theres tons of apps like with all iOS Devices, The battery lasts a good amount of time, the screen is very bright, the speakers are well built in ones but at that there very good, I'd recommend buying the Apple smart cover it makes that iPad you bought that much better, I've had it since day one and it's an amazing combo. I'm able to protect it, keep it apple clean and stylish, and it folds into a stand, and it unlocks it and locks it when closed and open.

This is an amazing device and I use it almost continuously at home.  It's more expensive then the Nexus 7 with less features, but because of the wider screen size I think the price is still worth it.  Also, the top tablets out right now come with 2 GB RAM but the IPad mini only has 1 GB and this noticibly slows Internet browsing and video loading times as compared with most other tablets.  With that said, this is my first tablet and the speeds have amazed me.  Everything this device does generally runs 100% smoothly and feels so natural to operate.  For the most part everything is intuitive and friendly.However, Apple controls all apps very tightly and because of this there are some things you can't do.  For example there is no flash suppport so if you decide to go to southparkstudios.com and try to watch the latest episode you will not be able to play it.  Also for things like video editing you'll be required to put up $5 for the software (IMovie is worth the price though).In the end my personal preference would go to one of the new ASUS tablets.  ASUS gives you much more power for the money and it works on the google operating system which comes with the full google suite of software which IMO is amazing.In closing, if you like apple and use ITunes a lot then this is a great mid range tablet computer that I highly recommend.

The price was the final determining factor when I purchased my Fire HD 8.9 at the beginning of the year. I have had the mini for a few weeks now and I certainly enjoy it.  For one thing, it is easier to slip into my purse.  It is lighter and smaller than the \"fire\". The podcasts I enjoy are not available with the \"fire\", but I could listen to them on my iPhone 5.  BUT, I must say, overall, I like my Fire HD 8.9 best.  If I were to purchase a tablet today (and could only have one tablet) my choice would be the new Fire HDX 7 inch.  I also would consider the 16G. With cloud storage, it is possible to get along with the 16G.  However, the price difference for the 16G and 32G is certainly more reasonable with the Fire than the iPad. Dollar for dollar Amazon has knocked this one out of the ball park.

The speaker audio quality is decent, the display is very nice, but the OS is just ho-hum anymore.  One thing I really don't like is it's size.

However, the deluge of icons is really confusing and it's very hard to navigate to what I was last doing upon turning the device on. It requires remembering, finding and usually quite a few clicks and typing. Very unintuitive. The iOS 7 is a complete disaster, it is very hard to tell what is a link, what is button, what I can click and what I can't. I am often confused. When I watch photos, it feels like I am in an email. It was very hard to find the url box in the Safari browser. I often can't recognize what is the selected object or link or button. Well there are no buttons or links, only blue text. It is minimalist style to the point of uselessness. It feels like the work of a European preoccupied with style over usability. Very unamerican and very unapple-like. In addition, reading magazines is very unpleasant, requires monthly subscriptions. It is very hard to buy a Bloomberg Markets for $5 like I can on the street. Also each magazine has its own app with different scrolling motions. Some scroll to the right, some scroll down. It is extremely confusing and frustrating. I just want to read magazines and flip from page to page and I kind of like checking out the ads as I browse.Also the content on the iPad is very expensive - movie rentals are north of $5-$6 and some hot titles can fetch $10 per rental. Also the 24 hour rental period is too short. I can rarely watch a movie in one night after coming home tired from work. Especially if the movie is 3 hours. I only got the iPad mini because the app ecosystem is so deep and there are games on it that my daughter wants to play that are unavailable on the Kindle Fire HDX.

Now, I wish my husband had purchased something else. It took about four hours for Apple to get it up and running. Four hours! I knew it wouldn't be as simple as turning on a button, but four hours is a bit much.There is a problem with this I-pad mini. I have had other difficulties with it.Another thing, no instructions came with this that even told me how to turn it on. I had to figure that out all by myself.My daughter purchased a cheaper brand, took her about one minute to set it up, and it works better than my expensive mini. Maybe for social media it's great. I don't do social media, so I really wouldn't know about that.I ordered three albums from I-tunes on it: one I was charged a dollar for. Then that was taken off my bank balance, and I still haven't been billed the correct amount. Another was supposed to have been $6.98 plus tax. It came to $17.something. There seems to be no rhyme nor reason to their pricing.Grrr!Another problem is the battery. This definitely does not hold a charge, even though I turn the device off when I'm not using it. This is just annoying, and I've decided not to use it for an e-reader. I have my Kindle,and the battery holds a charge much better. I am thinking about purchasing a kindle fire. I really can't see the I-pad mini as any kind of substitute for an e-reader or lap top.Update 1/11/2014: My I-pad mini has died. It isn't recharging at all. I deeply regret having purchased this. Other problems, when I type a comma, it switches it to an s or a totally different word! Disgusting. I don't know for sure, but I bet this was a used one sold as new. Too may problems to name here, but I will say if this is representative of an apple product, I'm not purchasing anymore apples. My Ipad mini has Itunes I've purchased. That was wasted money because now I can't use the Ipad to play them. Don't buy the mini. It's just a piece of junk!Update 2/17/2014: Took my iPad mini in. The UBS adapter was the wrong size for my mini. Also the UBS cable wires were bent. I bought a replacement for both items. Yesterday, I opened up Siri. I hadn't tried to use that before. I discovered all kinds of names in it. For instance, e-mail Shirley. Make reservations at a restaurant in Paris. It is loaded with other names and instructions. I know none of the names, and I've never even asked Siri for anything.

I have two original ipads (a Gen I and recent Gen III).  The big ipads are very robust; kids play with them, drop them out windows, use them to build forts, teach the dogs to fetch, etc., and I throw them in my pickup, use them on the jobsite, whatever.  Ive had the Gen I since 2010, and the other one for more than a year, and, although they both have extensive damage to the metal cases, and although the screen seal of the Gen I is half gone, neither screen has ever cracked.Both of my ipad minis have cracked screens.  One broke while bouncing up and down on the floor of my truck while driving on a dirt  road. The other screen broke when two of my kids were in a tug o war over the ipad. They didn't drop it, one just twisted it out of the others' hand and it cracked.  The ironic thing was when I went to the istore, and some \"Genius\" explained to me that I am totally wrong, and the iPad mini is much more robust than the ipad original.  Obviously I know the \"Genius\" thing is supposed to be ironic, but this was still a little irritating.Here is the deal. The ipad mini with a broken screen costs $219 to fix.  That is right. $220 to fix a product that costs a hair over $300 bucks.  I sold the first one on ebay for $170 (I mean, seriously, who would pay $170 for a broken ipad mini? What is going on there? Who knows?)  I am about to list the second.Bottom line: If you are a very careful old lady who uses the ipad mini once or twice a month on foam rubber on the floor and caresses the screen gently with a hypoallergenic goose feather before your servant locks it back away in a padded vault, this is the perfect device for you. On the other hand, if you are like a regular person who might actually use the device in the real world, the ipad mini is a little too dainty, especially if you have kids. I would definitely recommend the big ipad instead.Go on the apple support forums and you will see that my problem is very common with the mini.

They foolishly (IMO) said theyonly support Apple. DUH.,.there was an error message...and all that was needed (I think) was to deletea file in the folder the error message gave. YOU would THINK Apple tech support could have helped.Not to worry Hewlett Packard Tech support got me up and running. Thank goodness I have a new PC and under warranty.The ONE star is for a COMPANY that WILL not support their product on a PC.I just spent $659 on an apple product and smart cover with Houston slaes tax.THAT is the very last dime APPLE will see from me. As a new customer to APPLE I was appalled.NOW the reason to use Itunes is A) to buy them online...and B) to be able to backup your device.You do not have to be able to use the software on another device (like a pc or mac)..it is a safety feature.Also be careful syncing..because you can wipe out all IPAD data. Make sure the IPAD controls the data.I love my new ipad mini...I got the smart cover and highly recommend.The camera feature was great.I installed dropbox so I can access my travel documents.Things I learned:When buying these IPADs..first of all if you want one asap..you need to go with 32 MB or LARGER.The 16MPB go quickly.Then you have to DECIDE which IPAD to buy the unit configured with A data plan provider or none (wifi only).That can be AT&T;, Sprint, Verison. AGAIN...check the data plans offered because you can buy them separately from regular plan.AND you are stuck with the data plan provider.I got AT&T...and; wanted to use it for my trip this week to Mexico.AT&T; refused to sell me international data service until I had a data planfor three months. I am not a happy camper.AHA..not to worry.THAT restriction is ONLY if you call AT&T; and prebill contract for two years.If you buy the service yourslef month to month you CAN add international immediately.At least right now!You can buy from ipad mini...or online<...>you first MUST buy a data plan..and THEN you can immediately purchase an international plan.AND you can start the international plan any date up to one year in advance.It starts midnight eatsern time on day you select.I just picked the day before to be sure I had service AND you can log in and change the international date.And if you CANCEL att domestic plan..if you do they charge domestic data to international data or something. Read the terms and conditions.The att ipad domestic plans are month to month...you have to cancel 7 days in advance. They say they bill two hours in advance.RIGHT NOW...if you exceed your data..they do not bill you for more..your plans just stops until the next autorenew date. That is awesome!. Phew. However you can go online and add more time. Thischanges to a new 30 day period. Data does not roll (bummer).They allegedly have a non-autobill option for doesmetic. I could not figure it out.They give your device a cell data number for billing.International does NOT autobill.Use this address to view your iPad Data Account.<...>If you already have data you can use the email address / password on the right side to log in.If you don't have data you can use the Sign Up For Service button.There is not a lot of information on the page, so not sure if it will fit your needs or not.You can show the credit card information used on the account under the Edit User & Payment information page.I got the Ipad mini unit asap in person..on BLACK Friday...so I could get the unit immediately...and buy one with a data provider.Be careful in your choice of data provider.Love the ipad mini. It is much better than the Kindle Fire for travel/web access and photos.It has a camera and with dropbox, it automatically backs up pictures online, etc.I can share folders with friends using dropbox.The unit is small enough to take with.Battery lasts fine (8 hours) and the smart cover shuts it on and (sleep mode).I did have problems because I oops kept failing to fully plug it in. Make sure the usb is fully engaged.You do not have to turn unit off...just put it in sleep mode..uses very little battery.However it charges BEST when the unit is off.FYI-It does NOT use a jump drive.  Mini has the tiny \"lightening\" port.I suggest dropbox on a big pc rather than hacking it...and reformatting the jump drive.Someone said they got jump drive to work using a camera attachment.I just wanted a small device for traveling, taking pictures of my rental car, checking in online to get boarding passes.However...I can  use it at home and sit out by pool or in the living room...and it is kind of cool.I'm new to these devices...I love it. Not so much Apple support.And AT&T; is very very very hard to find IPAD info. Use links above.YOu can set up plan from your device....but I had trouble and had to go through a live person.Using the links I gave you can check your usage online.Once they make international sims with the NANO chip, of course you can get your own international data plan through them.Be very careful with your ipad mini sim.In summary:check to see if you can load latest itunes on a pc or mac first. (optional)check to see what data provider you want. (optional)you may need to get a larger unit 32 or 64 if you want one right away.for att...go to att.com.ipadlanding to see data pllans for ipad.", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Hoped, waited, never came", "Author": "Pam", "ReviewID": "RYCPZCL4O8RUS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I wouldn't know cause I haven't gotten it yet but I'm sure it's amazing!
